'''Feminist economics''' refers to an intellectual stream in [[economics|economic]] thought which applies [[feminism|feminist]] lenses to economics in order to challenge the [[androcentric]] biases inherent within it and produce an economics that is more [[gender]] inclusive. <ref>Beneria, Lourdes, Ann Mari May and Diana Strassmann, "Introduction" in Lourdes Beneria, Ann Mari May and Diana Strassmann, eds., 'Feminist Economics: Volume 1'. Cheltenham, UK and Northhampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, 2011. </ref> Feminist economists claim that contrary to common conceptions that economics is a [[positive economics | positive]] and [[objectivity (philosophy) |objective]] science "the discipline of economics is a creation of groups of people" <ref>Ferber, M.A. and Julie A. Nelson, "''Beyond Economic Man'': Ten Years Later," in Marianne A. Ferber and Julie A. Nelson, eds., ''Feminist Economics Today: Beyond Economic Man''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003. </ref>  and is therefore not truly objective, but instead, its models and methods reflect masculine patterns <ref>Nelson, Julie A., "Feminism and Economics" in Lourdes Beneria, Ann Mari May and Diana Strassmann, eds., 'Feminist Economics: Volume 1'. Cheltenham, UK and Northhampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, 2011. </ref> Consequently, they claim, the contemporary construction of economics focuses on "culturally '[[masculine]]' topics" including "autonomy, abstraction and logic" to the exclusion of "[[feminine]]" topics "such as women and family behavior as well as...connection, concreteness and emotion." <ref>Ferber, M.A. and Julie A. Nelson, "''Beyond Economic Man'': Ten Years Later," in Marianne A. Ferber and Julie A. Nelson, eds., ''Feminist Economics Today: Beyond Economic Man''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003. </ref>  Feminist economics critically examines economic [[epistemology]] and [[methodology]], emphasizes areas of traditional economic inquiry that have a particular relevance to [[women]] (for example, [[care work]]), and ultimately seeks to reform the field of economics itself.   . 

More specifically, feminist economists challenge the [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic]] assumptions: . 

#that interpersonal [[utility]] comparisons are impossible
#that tastes are [[exogenous]] and unchanging 
#that actors are selfish  
#that household heads act altruistically<ref>England, Paula, "The Separative Self: Androcentric Bias in Neoclassical Assumptions" in Lourdes Beneria, Ann Mari May and Diana Strassmann, eds., 'Feminist Economics: Volume 1'. Cheltenham, UK and Northhampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, 2011. </ref>
Additionally, feminist economists are concerned with examining phenomena poorly represented by existing models and, subsequently, using different forms of [[data collection]] and interpretation to produce more gender-aware theories.   . 

==Origins and history==. 
Early on, [[feminist]] [[ethicist]]s, [[economists]], [[political scientists]], and [[systems scientists]] argued that [[women's work| women's traditional work]] (e.g. child-raising, caring for sick elders) and occupations (e.g. nursing, teaching) are systematically undervalued with respect to that of men. For example, [[Jane Jacobs]]' thesis of the "[[Guardian Ethic]]" and its contrast to the "[[Trader Ethic]]" sought to explain what feminist economics claim is the systematic undervaluing of guardianship activity, including the child-protecting, nurturing, and healing tasks that were traditionally assigned to women. Measures such as [[employment equity]] were implemented in [[developed nation]]s in the 1970s to 1990s, but these were not entirely successful in removing wage gaps even in nations with strong equity traditions.  . 

While attention to women’s economic role and economic differences by gender started in the 1960s and there were feminist critiques of received economic theories in the 1970s and 1980s including those presented at the [http://www.aeaweb.org/committees/cswep/ Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession (CSWEP)] in 1972,<ref>Ferber, M.A. and Julie A. Nelson, "''Beyond Economic Man'': Ten Years Later," in Marianne A. Ferber and Julie A. Nelson, eds., ''Feminist Economics Today: Beyond Economic Man''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003. </ref> feminist economics took off in earnest with the founding of the [[#Heading International Association for Feminist Economics|International Association for Feminist Economics (IAFFE)]] and the journal ''[[Feminist Economics (journal)|Feminist Economics]]'' in 1994. <ref>Ferber, M.A. and Julie A. Nelson, "''Beyond Economic Man'': Ten Years Later," in Marianne A. Ferber and Julie A. Nelson, eds., ''Feminist Economics Today: Beyond Economic Man''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003. </ref> . 

As in other disciplines, the initial emphasis of feminist economists was to critique the established theory, methodology, and policy approaches. The critique began in [[microeconomics]] of the household and [[labor markets]] and spread to [[macroeconomics]] and [[international trade]], leaving no field in economics untouched. <ref>Peterson, Janice and Margaret Lewis, ''The Elgar Companion to Feminist Economics''. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar, 1999. </ref> Feminist economists pushed for and produced gender aware theory and analysis, broadened the focus on economics and sought pluralism of methodology and research methods.  . 

==Critiques of traditional economics==. 
Although there is no definitive list of the principles of feminist economics <ref>http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/gschnedr/FemPrcpls.htm#_ftn1</ref> feminist economists offer a variety of critiques of neoclassical economics.  . 

===Economics as a normative science===. 
Central to many feminist economic critiques is the recognition of value judgments in economic analysis. <ref>Nelson, Julie A., "Feminism and Economics" in Lourdes Beneria, Ann Mari May and Diana Strassmann, eds., 'Feminist Economics: Volume 1'. Cheltenham, UK and Northhampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, 2011. </ref> In other words, feminist economists suggest that "the issues that economists choose to study, the kinds of questions they ask, and the type of analysis undertaken all are a product of a belief system which is influenced by numerous factors, some of them ideological in character." This idea is contrary to the typical conception of economics as a [[positive science]]. <ref>http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/gschnedr/FemPrcpls.htm#_ftn1</ref> For example, Diana Strassmann, founding editor of the journal [[ Feminist Economics (journal) | <i>Feminist Economics</i> ]], comments, "All economic statistics are based on an underlying story forming the basis of the definition. In this way, narrative constructions necessarily underlie all definitions of variables and statistics.  Therefore, economic research cannot escape being inherently qualitative, regardless of how it is labeled." <ref> Strassman, Diana.  "Editorial: Expanding the Methodological Boundaries of Economics."  Feminist Economics 3 (2), 1997, vii-ix. </ref> As a result, feminist economists call for a discipline wide recognition of the value-laden decisions in the discipline.  . 

===Critiques of free trade===. 
A central principle of mainstream economics is "[[trade]] can make everyone better off" through efficiency gains from specialization and enhanced global efficiency <ref>Mankiw, N. Gregory.  Principles of Economics.  Fort Worth: Dryden Press, Harcourt Brace College Publishers, 1998</ref>. Many feminist economics may, however, wish to modify this claim. For example, they may highlight that in [[Africa]], specialization in the cultivation of a single [[cash crop]] for export in many countries made these countries extremely vulnerable to price fluctuations, weather patterns, and pests. <ref>http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/gschnedr/FemPrcpls.htm#_ftn1</ref>  Feminist economics may also consider the specific gendered effects of trade-deicisons. For example, "in countries such as Kenya, men generally controlled the earnings from cash crops while women were still expected to provide food and clothing for the household, their traditional role in the African family, along with labor to produce cash crops.  Thus women suffered significantly from the transition away from subsistence food production towards specialization and trade."<ref>http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/gschnedr/FemPrcpls.htm#_ftn1</ref> . 

===Inclusion of non-market activity===. 
Feminist economics call attention to the importance of non-market activities, such as [[childcare]] and [[domestic work]], to the development of the economy. <ref>Power, Marilyn., "Social Provisioning as a Starting Point for Feminist Economics" in Lourdes Beneria, Ann Mari May and Diana Strassmann, eds., 'Feminist Economics: Volume 1'. Cheltenham, UK and Northhampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, 2011. </ref>  This is a central departure from neoclassical analysis where these forms of labor are unaccounted for in economic models. Including such work in economic accounts is deeply gendered in that women disproportionately perform these tasks. Consequently, when they are unaccounted for in economic models, much work done by women goes uncounted, literally devaluing their work in economic models.    . 

[[File:Trabajadora doméstico.JPG|thumb|A Colombian domestic worker]] . 

===Power relations in economic models===. 
Feminist economics often assert that power relations exist within the economy, and therefore, must be assessed in economic models in ways that they previously have been overlooked. <ref>Power, Marilyn., "Social Provisioning as a Starting Point for Feminist Economics" in Lourdes Beneria, Ann Mari May and Diana Strassmann, eds., 'Feminist Economics: Volume 1'. Cheltenham, UK and Northhampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, 2011. </ref> For example, in "neoclassical texts, the sale of labor is viewed as a mutually beneficial exchange that benefits both parties.  No mention is made of the power inequities in the exchange which tend to give the employer power over the employee." <ref>http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/gschnedr/FemPrcpls.htm#_ftn1</ref> These power relations often favor men and there  " never any mention made of the particular difficulties that confront women in the [[workplace]]."  <ref>http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/gschnedr/FemPrcpls.htm#_ftn1</ref> Consequently, feminist economists claim,  "Understanding power and [[patriarchy]] helps us to analyze how male-dominated economic institutions actually function and why women are often at a disadvantage in the workplace." <ref>http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/gschnedr/FemPrcpls.htm#_ftn1</ref> . 

===Gender and race===. 
Feminist economics argue that [[gender]] and [[race]] must be considered in economic analysis because despite their claim that no classification of people can ever capture every element at work, by explicitly considering gender, race, class, and caste economic models may be improved. <ref>Brewer, Rose M., Cecilia A. Conrad and Mary C. King, eds. 2002. A special issue on gender, color, caste and class. Feminist Economics, 8 (2). </ref> Matthaei <ref> Matthaie, Julie.  "Why Feminist, Marxist and Anti-Racist Economists Should be Feminist--Marxist--Anti-Racist Economists."  Feminist economists, 2 (1), 1996, 22-42. </ref> describe the importance of gender and racial-ethnic factors to the field of economics in the following passage:  "Not only did gender and racial-ethnic differences and inequality precede [[capitalism]], they have been built into it in key ways.  In other words, every aspect of our capitalist economy is gendered and racialized; a theory and practice that ignores this is inherently flawed." Feminist economist Eiman Zein-Elabdin takes a different route highlighting that racial differences should be examined along with gender differences because they have both been historically excluded from economic modelling and therefore fall equally within the theoretical conception of "feminist difference." <ref>Elabdin-Zein, Eiman., "The Difficulty of Feminist Economics" in Lourdes Beneria, Ann Mari May and Diana Strassmann, eds., 'Feminist Economics: Volume 1'. Cheltenham, UK and Northhampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, 2011. </ref> In light of these issues, in July 2002 the journal [[ Feminist Economics (journal) | <i> Feminist Economics </i> ]] dedicated an issue to issues of "gender, color, caste and class." <ref>Power, Marilyn., "Social Provisioning as a Starting Point for Feminist Economics" in Lourdes Beneria, Ann Mari May and Diana Strassmann, eds., 'Feminist Economics: Volume 1'. Cheltenham, UK and Northhampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, 2011. </ref> . 

===Reformation of economic actors===. 
The neoclassical economic model of an actor is known as [[Homo economicus]] and describes a person who "interacts in society without being influenced by society," because "his mode of interaction is through an ideal [[market]]" in which price is the only necessary consideration. <ref>Nelson, Julie A., "Feminism and Economics" in Lourdes Beneria, Ann Mari May and Diana Strassmann, eds., 'Feminist Economics: Volume 1'. Cheltenham, UK and Northhampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, 2011. </ref> In this view, people are painted as rational actors who engage in [[marginal analysis]]. <ref> http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/gschnedr/FemPrcpls.htm#_ftn1 </ref>  Yet,  "feminist economists have demonstrated that people are more than just rational entities who act individually through marginal analysis.  Instead, feminist economists attempt to construct a more holistic vision of an economic actor, which includes group interactions and actions motivated by factors other than greed." <ref> http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/gschnedr/FemPrcpls.htm#_ftn1 </ref> Feminist economics claim that such a reformation of the economic actor will provide a better description of the lived experience of both men and women in the market, arguing that mainstream economics overemphasizes the role of individualism, competition and selfishness for all actors. Instead, feminist economists like [[Nancy Folbre]] state that cooperation also plays a role in the economy.  . 

The work of George Akerlof and Janet Yellen on efficiency wages as based on fairness provides an example of a feminist economic model of a economic actor. In their work, agents are not hyperrational, isolated monads, but are instead concerted with fairness, capable of experiencing jealousy, and interested in personal connections. They base this work on empirical work by sociologists and psychologists. In sum, they suggest that wages may be influenced by fairness considerations, rather than purely market forces, highlighting that economic actors are not solely engaged in traditional economics decision making processes. <ref>Nelson, Julie A., "Feminism and Economics" in Lourdes Beneria, Ann Mari May and Diana Strassmann, eds., 'Feminist Economics: Volume 1'. Cheltenham, UK and Northhampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, 2011. </ref>   . 

In addition, feminist economists highlight that [[agency]] is not available to all people, drawing attention to the problems of those who lack agency, such as children, the sick, and the frail elderly, and the way in which responsibilities for their care can serve to compromise the agency of their caregivers. These modifications are a critical departure from the homo economicus model.  . 

Moreover, feminist economists critique the central focus in neoclassical economics on monetary rewards.  [[Nancy Folbre]] notes, "legal rules and cultural norms can affect market outcomes in ways distinctly disadvantageous to women." More specifically, this analysis includes considerations of gendered [[occupational segregation]]. Feminist research in these areas directly contradicts the neoclassical description of [[labor markets]] in which [[occupations]] are chosen freely by individuals acting alone.  Thus economic relationships and actions are directly affected by gender roles, and a gendered perspective illuminates this aspect of the economy that would otherwise be ignored. <ref> http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/gschnedr/FemPrcpls.htm#_ftn1 </ref>  Feminist economics includes the study of norms because of their importance to economic issues.... thus the view that material incentives will provide the goods we want and need (consumer sovereignty) does not capture the realities of economic life for many people." . 

====Veblen's institutionalism====. 
{{main|Institutional economics}}  . 

Institutional economics focuses on understanding the role of the evolutionary process and the role of institutions in shaping economic behaviour. For feminist economists, it "emphasizes the complexity of human motives and the importance of culture and relations of power." <ref>Power, Marilyn., "Social Provisioning as a Starting Point for Feminist Economics" in Lourdes Beneria, Ann Mari May and Diana Strassmann, eds., 'Feminist Economics: Volume 1'. Cheltenham, UK and Northhampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, 2011. </ref> . 

===Interdisciplinary economic methodology===. 
Often economics is conceptualized as "the study of how society manages its [[scarce resources]]"<ref> Mankiw, N. Gregory.  Principles of Economics.  Fort Worth: Dryden Press, Harcourt Brace College Publishers, 1998. </ref> and is methodologically limited to mathematical inquiry <ref>Nelson, Julie A., "Feminism and Economics" in Lourdes Beneria, Ann Mari May and Diana Strassmann, eds., 'Feminist Economics: Volume 1'. Cheltenham, UK and Northhampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, 2011. </ref> These guidelines, traditional economists often argue, are used to assure objectivity and separate economics from "softer" fields including [[sociology]] and [[political science]]. Feminist economists, however, argue that this conception of economics is a holdover from the early years of the development of modern science and [[Cartesian philosophy]] and limits economic analysis.  . 

===Economic pedagogy===. 
Feminist economics suggest that both the content and teaching style of economics courses would benefit from notable changes. Some advocate for the inclusion of experimental learning, laboratory sessions, individual research and more chances to "do economics." <ref>Nelson, Julie A., "Feminism and Economics" in Lourdes Beneria, Ann Mari May and Diana Strassmann, eds., 'Feminist Economics: Volume 1'. Cheltenham, UK and Northhampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, 2011. </ref> Others call for a modified relationship between the professor and the students, predicated on increased dialogue. Many feminist economics are urgently interested in this topic because of the way it may shape the demographic compostion of future economists, pointing to arguments that the "classroom climate"- may affect certain students perceptions of ability in certain areas. <ref> Hall, Roberta M. and Bernice R. Sandler. 1982. <i> The Classroom Climate: A Chilly One for Women. </i>. Washington, D.C.: Association of American Colleges. </ref>  . 

==Major areas of inquiry==. 
===Economic epistemology===. 
Critical to feminist economic critiques is the assertion that "economics, like any science, is socially constructed." <ref>Nelson, Julie A., "Feminism and Economics" in Lourdes Beneria, Ann Mari May and Diana Strassmann, eds., 'Feminist Economics: Volume 1'. Cheltenham, UK and Northhampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, 2011. </ref> and make an important distinction that masculine bias in economics is primarily a result of [[gender]], not [[sex]]. In other words, when feminist economics highlight the biases of mainstream economics, they focus on social beliefs about masculinity that are closely associated with economics including, but not limited to objectivity, separation, logical consistency, indivdual accomplishment, mathematics, abstraction, and lack of emotion, not on the maleness of the actual practitioners. <ref>Nelson, Julie A., "Feminism and Economics" in Lourdes Beneria, Ann Mari May and Diana Strassmann, eds., 'Feminist Economics: Volume 1'. Cheltenham, UK and Northhampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, 2011. </ref>.  . 

Feminist economists call attention to the ways that mainstream economics privilege male-identified, [[western]], and [[heterosexual]] interpretations of economic life. More broadly, they incorporate feminist frameworks and [[feminist theory]] to show how communities of knowledge inherently signal their expectations regarding appropriate participants in their communities, to the exclusion of non-in-group members. Such criticisms extend to the theories, methodologies and central ares of research of economics.  . 

===Economic history===. 
Feminist economics highlight that [[mainstream economics]] has been disproportionately constructed by European-descended, [[heterosexual]], middle and upper-middle class men and that this has led to a conception of economics that overlooks the lived experiences of the diversity of the world's people, especially women, children and those in non-traditional family units.  . 

Additionally, feminist economists, claim that the historical bases of economics are inherently exclusionary to women. More specifically, Michele Pujol,<ref>Pujol, Michele, "Into the Margin!" in Lourdes Beneria, Ann Mari May and Diana Strassmann, eds., 'Feminist Economics: Volume 1'. Cheltenham, UK and Northhampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, 2011. </ref> points to five historical assumptions about woman that arose in this historical arena, became embedded in the formulation of economics and continue to be used to maintain that women are different from the masculinized norm and exclude them from the market. These include the ideas that:   . 

#All women are married, or if not yet, they will be and all women will have children. 
#All women are economically dependent on a male relative. 
#All women are (and should be) housewives due to their reproductive capacities.  
#Women are unproductive in the industrial workforce. 
#Women are irrational, unfit economic agents, and cannot be trusted to make the right economic decisions.  . 

===Well-being===. 
Many feminist economists argue for a reconception of economics focused less on economic mechanisms and more on the [[well-being]] of all people. <ref>Power, Marilyn., "Social Provisioning as a Starting Point for Feminist Economics" in Lourdes Beneria, Ann Mari May and Diana Strassmann, eds., 'Feminist Economics: Volume 1'. Cheltenham, UK and Northhampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, 2011. </ref> Many feminist economists argue that economic success cannot only be measured in terms of [[goods]] or [[gross domestic product]], but must also be measured by human well-being. Further, feminist economics claim that aggregate income is not sufficient to evaluate economic well-being, but that instead individual entitlements and needs must be taken into account.  . 

For example, [[Amartya Sen]], [[Sakiko Fukuda-Parr]], and other feminist economists contributed to the development of alternatives to [[GDP]], such as the [[Human Development Index]]. Other models of value to feminist economists include the [[labor theory of value]].  . 

====Human capabilities approach====. 
{{main|Capabilities approach}} . 

Feminist economist [[Amartya Sen]] was instrumental in creating the [[capabilities approach | human capabilities approach]], an alternative means to assess economic success rooted in the ideas of [[welfare economics]]. <ref> Alkire, S. (2002). Valuing Freedoms: Sen's Capability Approach and Poverty Reduction. (Oxford: Oxford University Press). </ref> <ref> Sen, Amartya. (1989). Development as Capability Expansion. Journal of Development Planning 19: 41–58, reprinted in Sakiko Fukuda-Parr and A.K. Shiva Kumar, eds. 2003. Readings in Human Development, pp. 3–16. New York: Oxford University Press. </ref> Unlike traditional economic measures of success, focused on [[GDP]], [[utility]], [[income]], [[assets]] or other monetary measures, the capabilities approach focuses on what individuals are able to do. This approach emphasizes both processes as well as outcomes and draws attentional to cultural, social and material dynamics of well-being. Following Sen, other feminist economists including [[Martha Nussbaum]], expanded on the model. And, in recent years, the capabilities approach has influenced the creation of new models including the UN's [[Human Development Index |Human Development Index (HDI)]] . 

====Labor theory of value====. 
The labor theory of value was most thoroughly developed in <i>Capital</i> by [[Karl Marx]]. This model highlights production as a socially contructed human project and redefines wages as a means to earning a living. This refocuses the motivating factors in economic models on human innate desires and needs as opposed to monetary incentives. <ref>Power, Marilyn., "Social Provisioning as a Starting Point for Feminist Economics" in Lourdes Beneria, Ann Mari May and Diana Strassmann, eds., 'Feminist Economics: Volume 1'. Cheltenham, UK and Northhampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, 2011. </ref> . 

===Household bargaining===. 
Central to feminist economic approaches is a retheorizing of "the family" and "the household." In classical economics these units are typically described as amicable and [[homogeneous]].  Most notably, [[Gary Becker]] and [[new home economists]] introduced the study of "the family" to traditional economics. His model, according to feminist economics however, "endorsed traditional expectations about the sexes" and applies individualistic rational-choice models to explain home behavior. <ref>Nelson, Julie A., "Feminism and Economics" in Lourdes Beneria, Ann Mari May and Diana Strassmann, eds., 'Feminist Economics: Volume 1'. Cheltenham, UK and Northhampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, 2011. </ref>. 
Feminist economists modify these assumptions to account for exploitative sexual and gender relations, [[single-parent families]], [[same-sex relationships]], familial relations with children and the consequences of reproduction. Specifically, feminist economists move beyond [[unitary household]] models and [[game theory]] to call attention to the diversity of household experiences.  . 

Mainstream economists usually assume the family is a single, altruistic unit and that the inputs (i.e. money) are distributed equally. Bina Agarwal and other feminist economists have critiqued the mainstream model and contributed to a better understanding of intrahousehold bargaining power. Agarwal argues that a lack of power and outside options for women hinders womens' abilities to negotiate within the family unit. [[Amartya Sen]] highlights how social norms that devalue women's [[unpaid work]] in the household often disadvantages women in [[intra-household bargaining]]. Crucially, these feminist economists argue that these claims have important economic outcomes that must be recognized within the economic framework.  . 

===The care economy===. 
{{main|Care Work}} . 

Feminist economists acknowledge [[care work]] as central to economic development and human well-being. Feminist economists examine both paid and unpaid care work. Feminist economists argue that traditional analysis of economic systems often fails to take into account the value of the unpaid work being performed by men and women in a domestic setting. Feminist economists have argued that unpaid [[domestic work]] is just as valuable as paid work and that measures of economic success should take unpaid work into account when evaluating economic systems. In addition, feminist economists have also drawn attention to issues of power and inequality within families and households. The work of the Equality Studies Department at [[University College Dublin]], and, in particular of Urningin Sara Cantillon has focused on the internal inequalities of domestic economic arrangements  which occur even within affluent households.  . 

Additionally, while much care work is performed in the home, care work may also take the form of [[paid work]]. As such, feminist economics examine the implications of paid care work, from the increasing involvement of women in the paid sphere, the potentials for exploitation in this arena, to the personal affects on the lives of care workers.  . 

Systemic study of the ways women's work is measured or not measured at all, undertaken by [[Marilyn Waring]] (see ''[[If Women Counted]]'') and others in the 1980s and 1990s, began to justify different means of determining value - some of which were influential in the theory of [[social capital]] and [[individual capital]], which emerged in the late 1990s and, along with [[ecological economics]], influenced modern [[human development theory]].  See also the entry on [[Gender and social capital|Gender and Social Capital]].  . 

===Unpaid work===. 
[[Image:Kenyan Fish Vendor.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A [[Kenya]]n woman sells fish outside. Women in the [[informal sector|informal labor market]] make up a major part of the global economy. Feminist economists seek to include the ramifications of this work in their data, analysis, and policy recommendations. Photo by Martha Chen.]] . 

Unpaid work can be separated into multiple categories: [[domestic work]], [[care work]], subsistence work, unpaid market labor and voluntary work.  There are no clear consensuses on the definitions of each category; however, broadly, these types of work can be considered as contributing to the reproduction of society.  . 

Domestic work is activities done in the maintenance of the home, and which are universally recognizable, such as doing the laundry.  Care work is work done by someone who is looking "after a relative or friend who needs support because of age, physical or learning disability, or illness, including mental illness"<ref name=Carmichael>Carmichael, Fiona, Claire Hulme, Sally Sheppard, and Gemma Connell. “Work-Life Imbalance: Informal Care and Paid Employment in the UK.” Feminist Economics 14.2 (2008): 3-35. </ref>; this work also includes the raising of children. Another aspect of the definition of care work "calls attention to activities that involve close personal or emotional interaction"<ref name=Folbre>Folbre, Nance. 2006. “Measuring Care: Gender, Empowerment, and the Care Economy.” Journal of Human Development 7(2): 183-99. </ref>. Also included in this category is "self-care", in which leisure time and activities may be considered.  Subsistence work is work done in order to meet base needs, such as collecting water, which do not have any market values assigned to them; although some of these activities “are categorized as productive activities according to the latest revision of the international [[System of National Accounts]] (SNA)…but are poorly measured by most surveys” <ref name=Folbre />.  Unpaid market work is understood as "the direct contributions of unpaid family members to market work that officially belongs to another member of the household"<ref name=Philipps>Philipps, Lisa. "Silent Partners: The Role of Unpaid Market Labor in Familis." Feminist Economics 14.2 (2008): 37-57. </ref>.  Voluntary work is usually understood as work done outside of the home, but for little to no remuneration.  . 

====Mainstream methods of measurement====. 
Although each country measures it's economic output, the most widespread method is the System of National Accounts (SNA), sponsored mainly by the [[United Nations]] (UN), but implemented by various other organizations, such as the [[European Commission]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), the [[Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), and the [[World Bank]].  The SNA recognizes that unpaid work is an area of interest, however, "unpaid household services are excluded from [it’s] production boundary"<ref name=UN>http://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/docs/SNA2008.pdf</ref>.  Feminist economists have criticized this system for this exclusion, as it is argued that by leaving out unpaid work, basic and necessarily labor is uncounted.  . 

Even accounting measures intended to recognize gender disparities are criticized for ignoring this type of work.  Two such examples are the [[Gender-related Development Index]] (GDI) and the [[Gender Empowerment Measure]] (GEM).  It is argued that neither index indicates much about unpaid work <ref name=Beteta>Beteta, Hanny Cueva. "What is missing in measures of Women’s Empowerment?" Journal of Human Development 7.2 (2006): 221-241. EconLit. Web. 25 February 2012. </ref>.  Despite these efforts to better measure gender inequalities, there is a call for a more comprehensive index is needed, which includes participation in unpaid work.  . 

In more recent years, there has been increasing attention to this issue, such as the recognition of the issue within the SNA reports, and a "UN commitment to 'measuring and valuing unpaid work' with specific attention to women's family care giving – reproduction and household activities. This aim was reaffirmed at the 1995 UN Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing"<ref name=Luxton>Luxton, Meg. “The UN, Women, and Household Labor: Measuring and Valuing Unpaid Work.” Women’s Studies International Forum 20.3 (1997): 431-439. </ref>.  . 

====Alternative methods of measurement====. 
The method most widely used is gathering information on time use, which has "been implemented by at least 20 developing countries and more are underway"<ref name=Folbre />.  Information is collected on how much time men and women spend on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis on certain activities that fall under the categories of unpaid work. 
Techniques to gather this data include surveys<ref name=Luxton />, in-depth interviews <ref name=Luxton />, diaries <ref name=Mullan>Mullan, Killian. "Valuing Parental Childcare in the United Kingdom." Feminist Economics 16.3 (2010): 113-139. </ref>, and participant observation<ref name=Luxton />.  Proponents of time use diaries believe that this method "generate[s] more detailed information and tend[s] to capture greater variation than predetermined questions"<ref name=Luxton />. However, others argue that participant observation, "where the researcher spends lengthy periods of time in households helping out and observing the labor process"<ref name=Luxton />, generates more accurate information, as the researcher can ascertain whether or not those studied are accurately reporting what activities they perform.  . 

=====Challenges=====. 
The first problem regarding the measurement of unpaid work is the issue of collecting accurate information.  This is always a concern in research studies, however, because of the magnitude of this problem in this topic, it is of special concern. "Time-use surveys may reveal relatively little time devoted to unpaid direct care activities [because] the demands of subsistence production in those countries are great"<ref name=Folbre />, and may not take into account multitasking – for example, a mother may collect wood fuel while a child is in the same location, so the child is in her care (an indirect form of care work).  It is usually argued that indirect care should be included, and it is in may time use studies, however, it may not be and as a result studies may undercount the amount of certain types of unpaid work.  Surveys have also been criticized for lacking "depth and complexity" <ref name=Luxton /> as questions cannot be specifically tailored.  Participant observation has been criticized for being "so time- consuming that it can only focus on small numbers of households"<ref name=Luxton />, and so limited information is gathered.  . 

A problem all types of data gathering run into is that the people who participate in these studies may not report accurately, for whatever reasons, perhaps the "people doing domestic labor have [had] no reason to pay close attention to the amount of time tasks take and they [may] often underestimate time spent in familiar activities"<ref name=Luxton />.  Using time as a measure has also been criticized as it may show "the slowest and most inefficient workers…as carrying the greatest workload"<ref name=Luxton />.  In addition, time use in assessing childcare is criticized as "easily obscur[ing] gender differences in workload. Men and women may both put in the same amount of time being responsible for children but as participant observation studies have shown, many men are more likely to 'babysit' their children while doing something for themselves, such as watching TV. Their standards of care may be limited to ensuring the children are not hurt; dirty diapers may be ignored or deliberately left until the mother returns" <ref name=Luxton />.  Another paradoxical aspect of this problem is that those most burdened may not be able to participate in the studies – "it is usually those women with the heaviest work loads who choose not to participate in these studies"<ref name=Luxton />.  In general, a criticism to be made is the use of time as a general measure and by its use “some of the most demanding aspects of unpaid work [are unexplored] and the premise that time is an appropriate tool for measuring women's unpaid work goes unchallenged” <ref name=Luxton />.  . 

A second problem noted concerning this topic is the unease of comparability across societies. "Comparisons across countries are currently hampered by differences in activity classification and nomenclature"<ref name=Folbre />.  In-depth surveys may be the only way to get the depth of information desired, but make it difficult to make cross-cultural comparisons <ref name=Luxton />.  A more specific aspect of this problem is the lack of adequate universal terminology in discussing unpaid work. "Despite increasing recognition that domestic labor is work, existing vocabularies do not easily convey the new appreciations. People still tend to talk about work and home as if they were separate spheres. 'Working mothers' are usually assumed to be in the paid labor force, despite feminist assertions that "every mother is a working mother." There are no readily accepted terms to express different work activities or job titles. Housewife, home manager, homemaker are all problematic and none of them conveys the sense of a women who juggles both domestic labor and paid employment". <ref name=Luxton /> . 

A third problem is the complexity of domestic labor and the issues of separating unpaid work categories.  Time use studies are now taking into account multitasking issues, where activities are separated into primary and secondary activities, however, not all studies do this and even those that do may not take into account “the fact that frequently several tasks are done simultaneously, that tasks overlap, and that the boundaries between work and relationships are often unclear. How does a woman determine her primary activity when she is preparing dinner while putting the laundry away, making coffee for her spouse, having coffee and chatting with him, and attending to the children”<ref name=Luxton />.  Some activities may not even be considered work, such as playing with a child (this has been categorized as developmental care work), by the caregiver, and so may not be included in the responses to a study <ref name=Luxton />.  As mentioned before, supervision (indirect care work) may not be "construe[d] as an activity at all"<ref name=Folbre />, which “suggests that activity-based surveys should be supplemented by more stylized questions regarding care responsibilities”<ref name=Folbre /> as these activities may be undercounted <ref name=Folbre />.  In the past, time use studies tended to measure only primary activities, and "respondents doing two or more things at once were asked to indicate which was the more important"<ref name=Luxton />, although this is changing in more recent years.  . 

====Valuation====. 
Feminist economists argue for three main ways of valuating unpaid work: opportunity cost method, replacement cost method, and input-output cost method.  Opportunity cost method "uses the wage a person would earn in the market"<ref name=Mullan /> to see how much value their labor-time has.  This method extrapolates from the opportunity cost theory in mainstream economics.  . 

The second method of valuation uses replacement costs.  In simple terms, this is done by measuring the amount of money a third-party would make for doing the same work if it was part of the market.  In other words, the value of a person cleaning the house in an hour is the same as the hourly wage for a maid.  Within this method there are two approaches: the first is a generalist replacement cost method, which examines if "it would be possible, for example, to take the wage of a general domestic worker who could perform a variety of tasks including childcare"<ref name=Mullan />. The second approach is the specialist replacement cost method, which aims to "distinguish between the different household tasks and choose replacements accordingly". <ref name=Mullan /> . 

The third method is input-output cost method.  This looks at both the costs of inputs and includes any value added by the household. "For instance, the value of time devoted to cooking a meal can be determined by asking what it could cost to purchase a similar meal (or output) in the market, then subtracting the cost of the capital goods, utilities and raw materials devoted to that meal. This remainder represents the value of the other factors of production, primarily labor". <ref name=Folbre /> These types of models try to value household output by determining monetary values for the inputs (in the dinner example: for the ingredients and production of the meal) and compare these with formal market equivalents. <ref name=Luxton /> . 

=====Criticisms=====. 
One criticism is how monetary levels are chosen.  A question which need to be addressed is how unpaid work should be valued when more than one activity is being performed or more than one output produced?  Another issue is differences in quality between market products and household products.  Some feminist economists take issue with using the market system to determine values.  Reasons for this objection include: it may lead to the conclusion that “the market provides perfect substitutes for non-market work” <ref name=Folbre />; the wage produced in the market for services may not accurately reflect "the actual opportunity cost of time spent in household production";<ref name=Mullan /> and the wages used in valuation methods come from industries where wages are already depressed because of gender inequalities, and so will not accurately value unpaid work. <ref name=Mullan /> A related argument is that the market “accepts existing sex/gender divisions of labor and pay inequalities as normal and unproblematic. With this basic assumption underlying their calculations, the valuations produced serve to reinforce sex/gender inequalities rather than challenge women's subordination". <ref name=Luxton /> . 

Criticisms are also leveled against the separate methods of valuation.  Opportunity cost method “depends on the lost earnings of the worker so that a toilet cleaned by a lawyer has much greater value than one cleaned by a janitor” <ref name=Luxton />, which means that the value varies too drastically. There are also issues with the uniformity of this method not just across multiple individuals, but also for a single person: it "may not be uniform across the entire day or across days of the week". <ref name=Mullan /> There is also the issue of whether any enjoyment of the activity should be deducted from the opportunity cost estimate. <ref name=Mullan /> . 

Replacement cost method also has critiques, such as what types of jobs should be used as substitutes.  For example, should childcare activities “be calculated using the wages of daycare workers or child psychiatrists?". <ref name=Mullan />  This also relates to the issue of depressed wages in female-dominated industries, and whether using these jobs as an equivalent leads to the undervaluing of unpaid work.  Some have argued that education levels should be comparable, for example, "the value of time that a college-educated parent spends reading aloud to a child should be ascertained by asking how much it would cost to hire a college-educated worker to do the same, not by an average housekeeper's wage". <ref name=Folbre /> . 

Critiques against the input-output methods include: the difficulty of identifying and measuring household outputs and the issues of variation of households and these effects <ref name=Mullan />.  . 

===The formal economy===. 
Research into the causes and consequences of [[occupational segregation]], the [[gender pay gap]], and "[[glass ceiling]]" phenomena have been a significant part of feminist economics. While conventional neoclassical economic theories of the 1960s and 1970s explained these as the result of free choices made by women and men who simply had different abilities or preferences, feminist economists pointed out the important roles played by  [[stereotyping]], [[sexism]], [[patriarchal]] beliefs and institutions, [[sexual harassment]], and [[discrimination]]. <ref>e.g., Bergmann, Barbara, Occupational segregation, wages and profits when employers discriminate by race or sex, Eastern Economic Journal 1 (2/3), 103-10, 1974. See also [[male-female income disparity in the United States]]. </ref> The rationale for, and the effect of, [[anti-discrimination law]], adopted in many industrial countries beginning in the 1970s, has also been a topic of research. <ref>Beller, Andrea H., 1982, Occupational Segregation by Sex: Determinants and Changes, The Journal of Human Resources 17(3): 371-392, 1982; Bergmann, Barbara In Defense of Affirmative Action, New York: Basic Books, 1996. </ref>  Women did, in fact, move in large numbers into previous male bastions (especially professions such as medicine and law) during the last decades of the 20th century.  . 

While overt employment discrimination by sex per se remains a concern of feminist economists, in recent years more attention has also been paid to discrimination against [[caregivers]]—those women, and some men, who give hands-on care to  children or sick or elderly friends or relatives.  Because many business and government policies were designed to accommodate the "ideal worker" (that is, the traditional male worker who had no such responsibilities) rather than caregiver-workers, inefficient and inequitable treatment may result. <ref>Waldfogel, Jane, “The Effect of Children on Women’s Wages,” American Sociological Review, 62: 209–17, 1997; Albelda, Randy, Sue Himmelweit, and Jane Humphries, 2004, "A special issue on lone mothers," Feminist Economics 10(2), 2004; Williams, Joan, Unbending Gender: Why Family and Work Conflict and What to Do About It, Oxford University Press, 2001. </ref> . 

===Globalization===. 
Feminist economists argue that [[economic development]] in the [[Global South]] depends in large part on improved reproductive rights; gender equitable laws on ownership and inheritance; and policies that are sensitive to the number of women in the [[informal economy]]. <ref>Benería, Lourdes, ''Gender, Development, and Globalization: Economics as if People Mattered''. London: Routledge, 2003</ref> . 

==Methodology==. 
===Interdisciplinary data collection===. 
Many feminist economists challenge the perception that only "objective" (often presumed to be [[quantitative research |quantitative]]) data are valid. Instead, feminist economists suggest that economists should enrich their analysis through the use of data sets generated from other disciplines. Additionally, many feminists economics propose utilizing non-traditional data collection strategies.  . 

===Ethical judgment===. 
Feminist economists claim that "ethical judgements are a valid, inescapable, and in fact desirable part of economic analysis." <ref>Power, Marilyn., "Social Provisioning as a Starting Point for Feminist Economics" in Lourdes Beneria, Ann Mari May and Diana Strassmann, eds., 'Feminist Economics: Volume 1'. Cheltenham, UK and Northhampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, 2011. </ref> This is a methodology that looks at systems not from the point of view of neutral observer, but from a specific moral position and viewpoint. Notably, the intention is not to create a more "subjective" methodology, but to counter-weight perceived biases in existing methodologies: By recognizing that all views of the world arise from viewpoints, it sheds light on what feminist economists claim are masculine biases.  According to feminist economists, too many theories, while claiming to present universal principles, actually present a masculine viewpoint in the guise of a "view from nowhere."<ref>Nelson, Julie, ''Feminism, Objectivity and Economics,'' Routledge, 1996. </ref> . 

===Alternative measures of success===. 
====Human development index====

Feminist economists often support use of the [[human development index]] as a composite statistic in order to assess countries by overall level of [[human development]], as opposed to other measures. The HDI takes into account a broad array of measures beyond monetary considerations including life expectancy, literacy, education, and standards of living for countries worldwide. <ref> Fukuda-Parr, Sakiko (2003). "The Human Development Paradigm: operationalizing Sen’s ideas on capabilities". Feminist Economics 9 (2–3): 301–317. </ref> . 

====Gender-related Development Index (GDI)====. 
{{main|Gender-related Development Index}} . 

The '''Gender-related Development Index''' (GDI) was introduced in 1995 in the [[Human Development Report]] written by the [[United Nations Development Program]] in order to add a gender-sensitive dimension to the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI). The GDI takes in to account not only the average or general level of well-being and wealth within a given country, but focuses also on how this wealth and well-being is distributed between different groups within society, especially those between genders. <ref name="Gender">Klasen S. UNDP's Gender-Related Measures: Some Conceptual Problems and Possible Solutions. Journal of Human Development [serial online]. July 2006;7(2):243-274. Available from: EconLit with Full Text, Ipswich, MA. Accessed September 26, 2011. </ref> . 

==Organizations==. 
Feminist economics is gradually becoming a widely recognized and reputed area of inquiry as evidenced by the numerous organizations either dedicated to feminist economics or widely influenced by its principles.   . 

===International Association for Feminist Economics===. 
Formed in 1992, the [http://www.iaffe.org/ International Association for Feminist Economics (IAFFE)], is independent of the [[American Economic Association]] (AEA) and seeks to challenge the masculine biases in neoclassical economics<ref>Ferber, M.A. and Julie A. Nelson, "''Beyond Economic Man'': Ten Years Later," in Marianne A. Ferber and Julie A. Nelson, eds., ''Feminist Economics Today: Beyond Economic Man''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003. </ref>. While the majority of members are economists, it is open "not only to female and male economists but to academics from other fields, as well as activists who are not academics" <ref>Ferber, M.A. and Julie A. Nelson, "''Beyond Economic Man'': Ten Years Later," in Marianne A. Ferber and Julie A. Nelson, eds., ''Feminist Economics Today: Beyond Economic Man''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003. </ref> and currently has over 600 members in 64 countries. <ref>http://www.iaffe.org/pages/about-iaffe/history/</ref>. Although its founding members were mostly based in the US, a majority of IAFFE's current members are based outside of the US.In 1997, IAFFE gained [[Non-Governmental Organization]] status in the [[United Nations]].  . 

===''Feminist Economics'' journal===. 
{{main|Feminist Economics (journal)|}} . 

In 1997, the journal ''[[ Feminist Economics (journal) | <i>Feminist Economics</i> ]]'' was awarded the Council of Editors and Learned Journals (CELJ) Award as Best New Journal. The 2005 ISI Social Science Citation Index ranked the journal ''Feminist Economics'' 20th out of 175 among economics journals and 2nd out of 27 among Women's Studies journals.  . 

==Relation to other disciplines==. 
[[Green economics]] incorporates ideas from feminist economics and [[Green movement|Greens]]{{Who|date=November 2009}} list [[feminism]] as an explicit goal of their political measures, often seeking higher valuations for such work.  Feminist economics is also often linked with [[welfare economics]] or [[labour economics]], since it emphasizes child welfare, and the value of labour in itself, as opposed to production for a marketplace, the focus of classical economy.  .
