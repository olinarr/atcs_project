[[File:Kopimi rainbow.png|right|thumb|The symbol of ''Kopimi'', an anti-copyright initiative developed by the [[Piratbyrån]], a Swedish organization actively opposing modern copyright law and practices, and the previous operators of [[BitTorrent tracker]] [[The Pirate Bay]], before it was spun off as an independent organization.]]
'''Anti-copyright''' refers to the complete or partial opposition to prevalent copyright laws. [[Copyright]] is known as the owner's right for copies to be only made by the owner or with his/her authorization in form of a license. <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wipo.int/freepublications/en/intproperty/909/wipo_pub_909.pdf |format=PDF| last = World Intellectual Property Organisation | title= Understanding Copyright and Related Rights | publisher = WIPO| accessdate = August 2008|pages= 6–7}}</ref> . 

The classic argument for copyright is the view that granting developers temporary [[monopolies]] over their works encourages further development and creativity by giving the developer a source of income; normally copyright is enforced within a framework of [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne convention]], instigated by [[Victor Hugo]] and signed in 1886. A central anti-copyright argument is that copyright has never been of net benefit to society and instead serves to enrich a few at the expense of creativity. Some anti-copyright groups may question the logic of copyright on economic and cultural grounds. Also, in the context of the [[Internet]] and [[Web 2.0]] it can be argued that copyright law needs to be adapted to modern [[information technology]].  . 

== Anti-copyright groups and scholars == . 

=== Groups advocating abolishing of copyright ===. 
[[File:Pro piracy demonstration.jpg|thumb|Demonstration in [[Sweden]] in support of [[file sharing]], 2006.]]
Many traditional [[anarchists]], including [[Leo Tolstoy]], expressed their refusal to accept copyright. <ref>[[Leo Tolstoy]], [[s:Letter to the Free Age Press|Letter to the Free Age Press]], 1900</ref> . 

[[Pirate Cinema]] and groups like [[The League of Noble Peers]] advance more radical arguments, opposing copyright per se. A number of anti-copyright groups have recently emerged in the argument around [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]], [[digital freedom]], and [[freedom of information]]; these include the [[Association des audionautes]]. <ref name=autogenerated10>{{cite web |url= http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.09/legitp2p.html| last = Rose | first = Frank | title = P2P Gets Legit – The new Ascap: Audionautes| publisher =Wired | month = September | year = 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.linux.com/articles/54587| last = Byfield | first = Bruce | title = FSF launches anti-DRM campaign outside WinHEC 2006| publisher =Linux | month = May | year = 2006}}</ref> . 

Recent developments related to [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] and [[peer-to-peer]] [[file-sharing]] have been termed by media commentators as "copyright wars", with [[The Pirate Bay]] being referred to as "the most visible member of a burgeoning international anti-copyright—or pro-piracy—movement". <ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-webscout29apr29,0,1261622.story?coll=la-home-entertainment | last = Sarno |first=Sarno | title= The Internet sure loves its outlaws| publisher = Los Angeles Times| month= April | year= 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/19/business/19online.html?partner=rssnyt&emc=rss | last = Mitchell | first = Dan | title = Pirate Take Sweden| publisher =The New York Times | month = August | year = 2006}}</ref> One well-publicized instance of [[electronic civil disobedience]] (ECD) in the form of large scale intentional [[copyright infringement]] occurred on February 24, 2004, in an event called [[Grey Tuesday]]. Activists intentionally violated [[EMI]]'s copyright of ''[[The Beatles (album)|The White Album]]'' by distributing [[MP3]] files of a [[Bastard pop|mashup]] album called ''[[The Grey Album]]'', in an attempt to draw public attention to copyright reform issues and anti-copyright ideals. Reportedly over 400 sites participated including 170 that hosted the album with some protesters stating that [[The Grey Album]] illustrates a need for revisions in [[copyright law]] to allow [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] under fair use of copyrighted material, or proposing a system of fair compensation to allow for sampling. <ref>{{cite web |url= http://techlawadvisor.com/blog/2004/02/grey_tuesday.htm | last = Kim  | first = Melanie  | title = The Mouse that Roared, Grey Tuesday| publisher =Tech Law Advisor |accessdate=2008-07-25 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/25/arts/music/25REMI.html?ex=1393045200&en=ecc65808f9ca5b86&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND | last = Werde  | first = Bill  | title = Defiant Downloads Rise From Underground| publisher =The New York Times | month = February | year = 2004}}</ref> . 

=== Groups advocating changes to copyright law ===. 
French group [[Association des audionautes]] is not anti-copyright per se, but proposes a reformed system for copyright enforcement and compensation. Aziz Ridouan, co-founder of the group, proposes for [[France]] to legalise [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]] and to compensate artists through a surcharge on [[Internet service provider]] fees (i.e. an [[alternative compensation system]]). Reportedly, major music companies have equated Ridouan's proposal with legitimizing piracy. <ref name=autogenerated10 /> In January 2008, seven Swedish members of parliament from the [[Moderate Party]] (part of the governing coalition), authored a piece in a Swedish tabloid calling for the complete decriminalization of [[filesharing]]; they wrote that "Decriminalizing all non-commercial file sharing and forcing the market to adapt is not just the best solution. It's the only solution, unless we want an ever more extensive control of what citizens do on the Internet."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080114-swedish-prosecutors-dump-4000-legal-docs-on-the-pirate-bay.html | last = Bangeman | first = Eric | title= Swedish prosecutors dump 4,000 legal docs on The Pirate Bay | publisher = Ars Technica | month = January | year = 2008}}</ref> . 

=== Groups advocating using existing copyright law ===. 
Groups that argue for using existing copyright legal framework with special licenses to achieve their goals, include the [[copyleft]] movement<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/ |title=What is Copyleft? |accessdate=2008-07-29}}</ref> and [[Creative Commons]]. <ref name=autogenerated7>{{cite web |url= http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Is_Creative_Commons_against_copyright.3F |title= Frequently Asked Questions | publisher = [[Creative Commons]] |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref> Creative Commons is not anti-copyright per se, but argues for use of more flexible and open copyright licenses within existing copyright law. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Is_Creative_Commons_against_copyright.3F|title= FAQ - Is Creative Commons against copyright?| publisher =Creative Commons |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref> Creative Commons takes the position that there is an unmet demand for flexibility that allows the copyright owner to release work with only "some rights reserved" or even "no rights reserved." According to Creative Commons many people do not regard default copyright as helping them in gaining the exposure and widespread distribution they want. Creative Commons argue that their [[Creative Commons Licenses|licenses]] allow [[entrepreneurs]] and [[artists]] to employ innovative business models rather than all-out copyright to secure a return on their creative investment. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#What_is_Creative_Commons.3F|title= FAQ - What is Creative Commons?| publisher =Creative Commons |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref> . 

=== Groups advocating democratic participation in formulating copyright law ===. 
The nascent group [[WhyNotAskMe.org]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://WhyNotAskMe.org/ | title = Why not ask me!}}</ref> is not anti-copyright per se, but demands a moratorium on fast-tracked legislation and secret trade negotiations that bypass the democratic process. They feel that proposed changes to copyright law are always in response to demands from powerful lobbies. They suggest there is no grass roots support for broadened rights, stricter enforcement, or longer copyright duration and that current legislation reflects neither the will nor priorities of the majority.  . 

=== Scholars and commentators ===. 
Scholars and commentators in this field include [[Lawrence Liang]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://meeting.creativecommons.org.tw/program:how-does-an-asian-commons-mean | title = How Does An Asian Commons Mean| publisher =Creative Commons | accessdate = 2008-07-31}}</ref> [[Jorge Cortell]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://homepage.mac.com/jorgecortell/blogwavestudio/LH20041209105106/LHA20050520091532/index.html| last = Jorge | first = Cortell | title = Lecturer censored in Spanish University (UPV) for defending P2P networks| publisher =Own Website | month = May | year = 2005}}</ref> [[Rasmus Fleischer]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockosamhalle.se/texter/fleischer.pdf|format=PDF| last = Fleischer | first = Rasmus | title = "Mechanical music" as a threat against public performance| publisher =Institute of Contemporary History, Sodertorn University College | month = May | year = 2006}}</ref> [[Stephan Kinsella]], and [[Siva Vaidhyanathan]].  . 

==Anti-copyright arguments==. 
===Economic arguments===. 
==== Intellectual monopoly ====. 
{{quote|"In the case of both patents and copyright, from the point of view of economics, there are two ingredients in the law: the right to buy and sell copies of ideas, and the right to control how other people make use of their copies. The first right is not controversial.  . 

In copyright law, when applied to the creator this right is sometimes called the "right of first sale." However, it extends also to the legitimate rights of others to sell their copies. It is the second right, enabling the owner to control the use of intellectual property after sale, that is controversial. This right produces a monopoly – enforced by the obligation of the government to act against individuals or organizations that use the idea in ways prohibited by the copyright or patent holder." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dklevine.com/general/intellectual/against.htm | last2 = Levine | first2 = D.K. | last1=Boldrin | first1=M. | title=Against Intellectual Monopoly | publisher=Cambridge University Press| year = 2008}}</ref>}} . 

===== ...results in a weaker incentive at creativity  =====. 
{{quote|"The evolution of copyright from an occasional grant of royal privilege to a formal and eventually widespread system of law should in principle have enhanced composers' income from publication. The evidence from our quantitative comparison of honoraria received by Beethoven, with no copyright law in his territory, and Robert Schumann, benefiting from nearly universal European copyright, provides at best questionable support for the hypothesis that copyright fundamentally changed composers' fortunes. From the qualitative evidence on Giuseppe Verdi, who was the first important composer to experience the new Italian copyright regime and devise strategies to derive maximum advantage, it is clear that copyright could make a substantial difference. In the case of Verdi, greater remuneration through full exploitation of the copyright system led perceptibly to a ''lessening of composing effort.''" <ref>{{cite | last = Scherer | first = F.M. | title=Quarter Notes and Bank Notes. The Economics of Music Composition in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries  | publisher=Princeton University Press | year = 2004}}</ref>}} . 

====Non-scarcity====. 
{{main article|Artificial scarcity}}
Some [[libertarians]], particularly proponents of [[Austrian economics]], including Stephan Kinsella, argue that copyright is invalid because, unlike physical property, intellectual property is not [[scarce]] and is, they claim, a legal fiction created by the state. That is, [[copyright infringement|infringing]] on copyright, unlike [[theft]], does not deprive the victim of the original item, and so enforcement of copyright law constitutes aggression on the part of the state. <ref>Kinsella, Stephan ''[http://mises.org/books/against.pdf Against Intellectual Property]'' (2008) ''Ludwig von Mises Institute''. </ref> . 

====Historical comparison====. 
It is entirely unclear that copyright laws are economically useful, even for the majority of authors. Thus Höffner compared the economic effects copyright law had on authors and publishing in the United Kingdom to those in Germany in the first part of the nineteenth century when in Germany such laws had not been instituted, and found that more books were printed and read in Germany where authors, in general, also made more money. <ref name=hoeffner>{{cite web|url=http://www.cippm.org.uk/downloads/Symposium%202009/Hoffner%20-%20vortrag_eng-10_min.pdf|author=Eckhard Höffner|title=Copyright and structure of authors’ earnings&#124;|accessdate=February 11, 2012}}</ref> . 

===Information technology related arguments===. 
==== Web 2.0 ====. 
One of the founders of [[Piratbyrån]] [[Rasmus Fleischer]] argues that copyright law simply seems unable to cope with the Internet, and hence is obsolete. He argues that the Internet, and particularly Web 2.0 have brought about the uncertain status of the very idea of "copying" itself. He argues that in an attempt to rein in Web 2.0, copyright law in the 21st century is increasingly concerned with criminalizing entire technologies, leading to recent attacks on different kinds of [[search engines]], solely because they provide links to files which may be copyrighted. Fleischer points out that Google, while still largely uncontested, operates in a gray zone of copyright (e.g. the business model of [[Google Books]] is to display millions of pages of copyrighted and uncopyrighted books as part of a business plan drawing its revenue from advertising). In contrast, others have pointed out that [[Google Books]] blocks-out large sections of those same books, which motivates purchases, and supports the legitimate interests of rightsholders.  . 

Fleischer's central argument is that copyright has become obsolete with regards to the Internet, that the cost of trying to enforce it is unreasonable, and that instead business models need to adapt to the reality of the darknet. <ref name=autogenerated8>{{cite web |url= http://www.cato-unbound.org/2008/06/09/rasmus-fleischer/the-future-of-copyright/ | last = Fleischer | first = Rasmus | title = The Future of Copyright| publisher =CATO Unbound | month = June | year = 2008}}</ref> . 

===Cultural arguments===. 
==== Freedom of knowledge ====. 
Groups such as ''Hipatia'' advance anti-copyright arguments in the name of "freedom of knowledge" and argue that knowledge should be "shared in solidarity". Such groups may perceive "freedom of knowledge" as a right, and/or as fundamental in realising the [[right to education]], which is an internationally recognised [[human right]], as well as the right to a [[Free culture movement|free culture]] and the right to free communication. They argue that current copyright law hinders the realisation of these rights in today's knowledge societies relying on new technological means of communication. <ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite web |url= http://www.hipatia.info/index.php?id=manifesto2_en |title= Second Manifesto | publisher = Hipatia |accessdate=2008-07-25}}</ref> . 

Such groups see copyright law as preventing or slowing human progress. They argue that the current copyright system needs to be brought into line with reality and the needs of society. Hipatia argues that this would "provide the ethical principles which allow the individual to spread his/her knowledge, to help him/herself, to help his/her community and the whole world, with the aim of making society ever more free, more equal, more sustainable, and with greater solidarity."<ref name=autogenerated4 /> . 

==== Authorship and creativity ====. 
[[Lawrence Liang]], founder of the Alternative Law Forum, argues that current copyright is based on a too narrow definition of "author", which is assumed to be clear and undisputed. Liang observes that the concept of "the author" is assumed to make universal sense across cultures and across time. Instead, Liang argues that the notion of the author as a unique and transcendent being, possessing originality of spirit, was constructed in [[Europe]] after the [[industrial revolution]], to distinguish the personality of the author from the expanding realm of mass produced goods. Hence works created by "authors" were deemed original, and merges with the doctrine of [[property]] prevalent at the time. <ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web |url= http://www.countercurrents.org/hr-suresh010205.htm | last = Liang | first = Lawrence | title = Copyright/Copyleft: Myths About Copyright | publisher =Infochangeindia.org | month = February | year = 2005}}</ref> . 

Liang argues that the concept of "author" is tied to the notion of copyright and emerged to define a new social relationship - the way society perceives the ownership of knowledge. The concept of "author" thus naturalised a particular process of knowledge production where the emphasis on individual contribution and individual ownership takes precedence over the concept of "community knowledge". <ref name=autogenerated2 /> Relying on the concept of the author, copyright is based on the assumption that without an [[intellectual property]] rights regime, authors would have no incentive to further create, and that artists cannot produce new works without an economic incentive. Liang challenges this logic, arguing that "many authors who have little hope of ever finding a market for their publications, and whose copyright is, as a result, virtually worthless, have in the past, and even in the present, continued to write."<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Liang points out that people produce works purely for personal satisfaction, or even for respect and recognition from peers. Liang argues that the 19th Century saw the prolific authorship of literary works in the absence of meaningful copyright that benefited the author. In fact, Liang argues, copyright protection usually benefited the publisher, and rarely the author. <ref name=autogenerated2 /> . 

==Criticism of Anti-copyright==. 
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}
Copyright proponents such as [[Sumner M. Redstone]] of the [[Progress and Freedom Foundation]], majority owner of [[CBS Corporation]], [[Viacom]], [[MTV Networks]], and [[BET]],  argue that copyright drives the economy by compelling creativity, and is a fundamental right for both creators and consumers. He argued that all proposed alternatives to copyright protection do not allow for viable [[business model]]s, as content creators would not have incentive to produce their products if they cannot be guaranteed payment. <ref name=pff>{{cite web |url= http://www.pff.org/issues-pubs/pops/pop13.21_sumner_speech.pdf | title = Copyright is Even More Right in the Digital Age| publisher =pff.org | month = January | year = 2011}}</ref> "''Propose to a dairy farmer that the milk he sells become a free commodity available to all, and he will stop cultivating cows. Why buy the cow, when consumers can get the milk for free?'"'<ref name=pff /> . 

Richard Verrier, editor at [[Los Angeles Times]] who covers labor and production issues in Hollywood, wrote in a article that piracy undermined [[Independent film|Independent Filmmakers]], who unlike larger studios, can not afford revenue loss. <ref name=LAT>{{cite news |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2010/sep/28/business/la-fi-ct-film-pirate-20100928 | title = Independent filmmakers feel the squeeze of piracy| publisher =Los Angeles Times | month = September | year = 2010 | first=Richard | last=Verrier}}</ref> Independent filmmaker Greg Carter described it as; ''"It feels like someone is walking into your house and stealing your furniture... The big studios can absorb it, but guys like me, we're not millionaires. We're fighting like crazy for every dollar, every nickel, every penny just to survive in this marketplace.''"<ref name=LAT /> . 

According to a study by the Institute for Policy Innovation, self-described as a "non-profit, non-partisan public policy think tank", the piracy of copyrighted material costs the U.S. economy $5.5 billion in annual earnings among U.S. workers, as well as $837 million in lost annual tax revenue and $20.5 billion in lost annual output to all US industries. Furthermore, they estimate that piracy costs the U.S 141,030 jobs, two thirds of which are outside the film industry. <ref name=ipi>{{cite web |url= http://www.ipi.org/ipi%5CIPIPublications.nsf/PublicationLookupExecutiveSummary/A6EB1EAC4310AF6F862571F7007CB6AF | title = The True Cost of Motion Picture Piracy to the U.S. Economy| publisher =ipi.org | month = September | year = 2011}}</ref> .
