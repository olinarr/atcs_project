'''Economic interventionism''' is an action taken by a government or an [[international institution]] in a [[market economy]] or market-oriented [[mixed economy]], beyond the basic regulation of fraud and enforcement of contracts, in an effort to impact the  [[economics|economy]]. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Ellen Frankel|first=Paul|title=Laissez Faire in Nineteenth Century Britain: Fact or Myth|journal=Literature of Liberty|year=1980|volume=iii|issue=4|pages=5-38|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/LtrLbrty/fplLNB1.html|accessdate=5 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Karagiannis|first=Nikolaos|title=“KEY ECONOMIC AND POLITICO-INSTITUTIONAL ELEMENTS OF MODERN INTERVENTIONISM.”|journal=Social and Economic Studies|year=2001|volume=50|issue=3/4|pages=17-47|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/27865245}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=von Mises|first=Ludwig|title=INTERVENTIONISM:  AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS|year=Ed.1998|publisher=The Foundation for Economic Education, Inc.|location=New York|pages=10-12|url=http://www.hacer.org/pdf/Mises09.pdf}}</ref>   Economic intervention can be aimed at a variety of political or economic objectives, such as promoting economic growth, increasing employment, raising wages, raising or reducing prices, promoting equality, managing the money supply and interest rates, increasing profits, or addressing [[market failure]]s. The term economic ''intervention'' assumes the state and economy are inherently separate from each other<ref>{{cite web|last=Lu|first=Catherine|title=Intervention|url=http://sage-ereference.com.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/view/politicaltheory/n233.xml?rskey=lrs7HL&result=1&q=intervention|work=Encyclopedia of Political Theory|publisher=SAGE|accessdate=5 February 2012}}</ref>; therefore applies to capitalist market or mixed economies where government action interrupts the market forces at play with orders or sanctions, which will benefit the state (although this does not apply to [[state-owned enterprises]] that operate in the market). <ref>{{cite book|last=von Mises|first=Ludwig|title=INTERVENTIONISM: AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS|year=Ed. 1998|publisher=The Foundation  for Economic Education, Inc|location=New York|pages=10-12|url=http://www.hacer.org/pdf/Mises09.pdf}}</ref>  . 

'''Economic planning''' in market economies is sometimes considered to be a form of intervention when it intervenes in the setting of prices and the distribution of goods determined by the market.  . 

Economic planning tends to be associated with the [[left-wing politics|political left]], while economic interventionism is often associated with [[centrism]], which believes that certain market outcomes are undesirable or ineffective and ought to be mitigated. Economic interventionism and planning are sometimes practiced by [[National conservatism|national conservative]], [[corporatism|fascist]], [[Economic nationalism|economic nationalist]] and right-wing parties with the thinking that the [[free market]] can damage national traditions, social order, or the authority of the state itself.  . 

== Types of interventions ==. 
Economic interventions common in contemporary governments include{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} targeted [[tax]]es, targeted [[tax credit]]s, [[minimum wage]] legislation, [[union shop]] rules, contracting preferences, direct subsidies to certain classes of producers, [[price support]]s, price caps, [[production quota]]s, import quotas, and [[tariff]]s. 
[[Demand management]] and [[Keynesian economics]] ([[helicopter money]]) are sometimes cited as mild forms of economic planning, designed to overcome cyclical instability inherent in market economies, or to make market economies function properly in a desired fashion.  . 

==Related concepts==. 
[[Economic planning]] refers to planned economic activity in production. Planned economic activity may be direct (directive planning), or indirect as in the case of [[indicative planning]]. An economic system that is characterized by the primacy of economic planning over the market is referred to as a [[planned economy]], where resource allocation and the quantity produced is allocated by non-market means, usually through state-led planning.  . 

Government regulation can also be a type of intervention when it inhibits, corrects or distorts the market mechanism in setting the price of a good or service.  . 

== Effects ==. 
Advocates of free market or laissez-faire economics tend to see government intervention as harmful, due the fallacy of central planning, the law of unintended consequences, and other considerations. State economic interventionism, regulating the market for the means of social welfare, deters from the ultimate overthrow of capitalism. <ref name="Gamble et al">{{cite book|last=Pierson|first=Chris|title=Marxism and Social Science Ed. Gamble et al.|year=Ed. 1999|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana  and Chicago|pages=176-177|url=http://www.revalvaatio.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/gamble_et_all-marxism_and_social_science.pdf}}</ref>  The economically left-wing entities can see economic interventionism as a way of ensuring that firms adhere to the social boundaries of that country and that they often outweigh potential negative [[unintended consequence]]s. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Karagiannis|first=Nikolaos|title=“KEY ECONOMIC AND POLITICO-INSTITUTIONAL ELEMENTS OF MODERN INTERVENTIONISM.”|journal=Social and Economic Studies|year=2001|volume=50|issue=3/4|pages=19-21|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/27865245}}</ref> . 

Regulatory authorities do not consistently close markets, yet as one sees in Latin America, the states and various institutions ([[IMF]] and [[World Bank]]) engaged in liberalizing the economy "...financial liberalization and privatization coincided with democratization". <ref>{{cite journal|last=Karagiannis|first=Nikolaos|title=“KEY ECONOMIC AND POLITICO-INSTITUTIONAL ELEMENTS OF MODERN INTERVENTIONISM.”|journal=Social and Economic Studies|year=2001|volume=50|issue=3/4|pages=19-21|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/27865245}}</ref> One study suggests that after the [[lost decade]] an increasing "diffusion of regulatory authorities" emerged <ref>{{cite journal|last=Jordana|first=Jacint|coauthors=David Levi-Faur|title=The Diffusion of Regulatory Capitalism in Latin America: Sectoral and National Channels in the Making of a New Order|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|year=2005|month=Mar|volume=598|issue=The Rise of Regulatory Capitalism: The Global Diffusion of a new Order|pages=102-124|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/25046082|accessdate=1 February 2012}}</ref>, these actors engaged in restructuring the economies within Latin America. Latin America through the 1980's had undergone a debt crisis and ''hyperinflation'' (during 1989 and 1990). These international  stakeholders restricted the state's economic leverage, and bound it in contract to co-operate. <ref>{{cite web|last=FONDAD|title=The Argentine Drama:  A View from the IMF Board|url=fondad.org|work=The Crisis That Was Not Prevented: Argentina, the IMF, and Globalisation|publisher=FONDAD|accessdate=2 February 2012}}</ref>  Multiple projects and years of failed attempts, for the Argentine state to comply, the renewal and intervention seemed stalled.  Two key intervention factors that instigated economic progress in Argentina, was substantially increasing privatization and the establishment of a currency board. <ref>{{cite web|last=FONDAD|title=The Argentine Drama:  A View from the IMF Board|url=fondad.org|work=The Crisis That Was Not Prevented: Argentina, the IMF, and Globalisation|publisher=FONDAD|accessdate=2 February 2012}}</ref>
As one can see this exemplifies global institutions including the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]]instigate and propagate openness to increase foreign investments and economic development within places including Latin America. <ref>{{cite book|last=von Mises|first=Ludwig|title=INTERVENTIONISM:  AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS|year=Ed.1998|publisher=The Foundation for Economic Education, Inc.|location=New York|pages=10-12|url=http://www.hacer.org/pdf/Mises09.pdf}}</ref> . 

'''Why the government intervenes in the market:'''
(Within a Western Liberal Democracy) The state will weigh the [[cost benefit]] for the intervention for the population or they succumb beneath coercion by a third private party and must take action. <ref>{{citejournal|last=Lanchester|first=John|title=Bankocracy|journal=London Review of Books|date=November 5|year=2009|volume=31|issue=21}}</ref>   Also intervention for economic development is at the discretion and self-interest of the stake holders, the multifarious interpretations of ''progress'' and [[development theory]] could mean. <ref>{{cite book|last=von Mises|first=Ludwig|title=INTERVENTIONISM:  AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS|year=Ed.1998|publisher=The Foundation for Economic Education, Inc.|location=New York|pages=1-51|url=http://www.hacer.org/pdf/Mises09.pdf}}</ref> To illustrate this during the 2008 debt crisis; the government and international institutions did not prop [[Lehman Brothers]] up therefore allowing them to file bankruptcy. Days later when [[AIG]] waned towards collapsing, the state was coerced into spending public money to keep it from falling. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Lanchester|first=John|title=Bankocracy|journal=London Review of Books|date=November 5|year=2009|volume=31|issue=21}}</ref>  These corporations have had interconnected interests with the state. Therefore their distinct role in economic intervention is to encourage the government on regulatory policies<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lanchester|first=John|title=Bankocracy|journal=London Review of Books|date=November 5|year=2009|volume=31|issue=21}}</ref> and elicit as much capitalist freedom for the accumulation of property as possible. <ref name="Gamble et al">{{cite book|last=Pierson|first=Chris|title=Marxism and Social Science|year=Ed. 1999|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana  and Chicago|pages=176-177|url=http://www.revalvaatio.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/gamble_et_all-marxism_and_social_science.pdf}}</ref> .
