'''Neoliberalism''' is a [[Contemporary history|contemporary]] [[political movement]] advocating [[economic liberalism|economic liberalizations]], [[free trade]] and [[open market]]s. Neoliberalism supports the [[privatization]] of [[Nationalization|nationalized industries]], [[deregulation]], and enhancing the role of the [[private sector]] in modern [[society]]. It is commonly informed by [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] or [[Austrian School|Austrian]] [[economics]]. The [[#Terminology|term neoliberal]] today is often used as a [[Pejorative|general condemnation]] of economic liberalization [[Public policy|policies]] and advocates. <ref name="common-day-usage"/><ref>Stanley Fish, ''Neoliberalism and Higher Education'', New York Times, March 8 2009, retrieved March 1 2012, [http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/08/neoliberalism-and-higher-education/]</ref> . 

==Terminology==. 
The term “neoliberalism” was coined in 1938 by the German scholar [[Alexander Rüstow]] at the [[Colloque Walter Lippmann]]. <ref>[[Philip Mirowski]], Dieter Plehwe, The road from Mont Pèlerin: the making of the neoliberal thought collective, Harvard University Press, 2009, ISBN 0-674-03318-3, p. 12-13, 161</ref><ref>[[Oliver Marc Hartwich]],[http://www.ort.edu.uy/facs/boletininternacionales/contenidos/68/neoliberalism68.pdf Neoliberalism: The Genesis of a Political Swearword], Centre for Independent Studies, 2009, ISBN 1-86432-185-7, p. 19</ref><ref>[[Hans-Werner Sinn]], Casino Capitalism, Oxford University Press, 2010, ISBN 0-19-162507-8, p. 50</ref> The colloquium defined the concept of neoliberalism as “the priority of the price mechanism, the free enterprise, the system of competition and a strong and impartial state.”<ref>Philip Mirowski, Dieter Plehwe, The road from Mont Pèlerin: the making of the neoliberal thought collective, 2009, p. 13-14</ref> To be “neoliberal” meant that “laissez-faire” liberalism is not enough and that - in the name of liberalism - a modern economic policy is required. <ref>François Denord, From the Colloque Walter Lippmann to the Fifth Republic, in Philip Mirowski, Dieter Plehwe, The road from Mont Pèlerin: the making of the neoliberal thought collective, 2009, p. 48</ref> After the colloquium “neoliberalism” became a label for several academical approaches such as the [[Freiburg school]], the [[Austrian School]] or the [[Chicago school of economics]]. <ref>Philip Mirowski, Dieter Plehwe, The road from Mont Pèlerin: the making of the neoliberal thought collective, 2009, p. 14 f</ref> . 

During the military rule under [[Augusto Pinochet]] in Chile opposition scholars took up the expression again without a specific reference to any theoretical revision of liberalism. Rather, it described a set of political and economic reforms being implemented in Chile and imbued the term with pejorative connotations. <ref>Taylor C. Boas and Jordan Gans-Morse, Neoliberalism: From New Liberal Philosophy to Anti-Liberal Slogan, Studies in Comparative International Development (SCID), Volume 44, Number 2, {{DOI|10.1007/s12116-009-9040-5}}, p. 151-152</ref> . 

In the last two decades, according to the Boas and Gans-Morse study of 148 journal articles, neoliberalism is almost never defined but used in several senses to describe ideology, economic theory, development theory, or economic reform policy. It has largely become a term of condemnation employed by critics of liberalizing economic tendencies. And it now suggests a “market fundamentalism” closer to the “paleoliberals” as opposed to the primary meaning. This leaves some controversy as to the precise meaning of the term and its usefulness as a descriptor in the social sciences, especially as the number of different kinds of market economies have proliferated in recent years. <ref name="common-day-usage">Taylor C. Boas and Jordan Gans-Morse, Neoliberalism: From New Liberal Philosophy to Anti-Liberal Slogan, Studies in Comparative International Development (SCID), Volume 44, Number 2, 137-161</ref> . 

==Post-WWII neo-liberal currents==. 
=== Mont Pelerin Society ===. 
[[File:Friedrich_Hayek_portrait.jpg|thumb|left|[[Friedrich Hayek]]]]
[[File:Milton Friedman, July 25, 2005.jpg|thumb|left|[[Milton Friedman]], 2005]] . 

The [[Mont Pelerin Society]] was founded in 1947 by [[Friedrich Hayek]] to bring together the widely scattered neoliberal thinkers and political figures. "Hayek and others believed that classical liberalism had failed because of crippling conceptual flaws and that the only way to diagnose and rectify them was to withdraw into an intensive discussion group of similarly minded intellectuals."<ref>[[Philip Mirowski]], Dieter Plehwe, ''The road from Mont Pèlerin: the making of the neoliberal thought collective'', Harvard University Press, 2009, ISBN 0-674-03318-3, p. 16</ref> With central planning in the ascendancy world-wide and with few avenues to influence policymakers, the society served to bring together isolated advocates of liberalism as a “rallying point”--as Milton Friedman phrased it. Meeting annually, it would soon be a “kind of international ‘who’s who’ of the classical liberal and neo-liberal intellectuals.”<ref>[[George H. Nash]], ''The Conservative Intellectual Movement in America Since 1945'', Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 1976, ISBN 978-1-882926-12-1, pp 26-27</ref> While the first conference in 1947 was almost half American, the Europeans concentration dominated by 1951. Europe would remain the “epicenter” of the community with Europeans dominating the leadership. <ref>Philip Mirowski, Dieter Plehwe, ''The road from Mont Pèlerin, 2009'', p. 16-17</ref> . 

=== Chicago School ===. 
The [[Chicago school of economics]] describes a [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] school of thought within the academic community of economists, with a strong focus around the faculty of [[University of Chicago]].  . 

The school emphasizes non-intervention from government and generally rejects regulation in markets as inefficient with the exception of central bank regulation of the money supply (i.e. [[monetarism]]). It is associated with [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical price theory]] and [[libertarianism]] and the rejection of [[Keynesianism]] in favor of [[monetarism]] until the 1980s, when  it turned to [[rational expectations]].  The school has impacted the field of [[finance]] by the development of the [[efficient market hypothesis]]. In terms of methodology the stress is on "positive economics"– that is, empirically based studies using statistics to prove theory.  . 

Approximately 70% of the professors in the economics department have been considered part of the school of thought.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The University of Chicago department, widely considered one of the world’s foremost economics departments,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://economics.uchicago.edu/about_lit_grad_economics.shtml |title=ECONOMICS AT CHICAGO, University of Chicago Department of Economics |publisher=Economics.uchicago.edu |date=2011-09-16 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref><ref>[http://worldbest-universities.blogspot.com/2007/11/university-of-chicago.html University of Chicago], World University Ranking</ref><ref>[http://www.scribd.com/doc/236930/Worldwide-Ranking-of-Economics-Departments-and-Economists Worldwide Ranking of Economics Departments and Economists], Scribd</ref> has fielded more [[Nobel Prize]] winners and [[John Bates Clark Medal|John Bates Clark medalists]] in economics than any other university.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} . 

Those who attend to the Chicago School prefer some form of [[competition law]], [[school vouchers]], [[intellectual property]] and  prefer [[Milton Friedman]]'s [[negative income tax]] as a replacement to the existing system.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} . 

==Policy implications==. 
Neoliberalism seeks to transfer control of the economy from public to the private sector,<ref>Cohen, Joseph Nathan (2007) "The Impact of Neoliberalism, Political Institutions and Financial Autonomy on Economic Development, 1980–2003" Dissertation, Department of Sociology, Princeton University. 2007</ref> under the belief that it will produce a more efficient government and improve the economic health of the nation. <ref>Prasad, (2006)</ref> The definitive statement of the concrete policies advocated by neoliberalism is often taken{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} to be [[John Williamson]]'s<ref>Williamson, John (1990) "What Washington Means by Policy Reform" in John Williamson, ed. ''Latin American Adjustment: How Much Has Happened?'' Washington, DC: Institute for International Economics</ref> "[[Washington Consensus]]", a list of policy proposals that appeared to have gained consensus approval among the Washington-based international economic organizations (like the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and [[World Bank]]). Williamson's list included ten points: . 

* [[Fiscal policy]] Governments should not run large deficits that have to be paid back by future citizens, and such deficits can only have a short term effect on the level of employment in the economy. Constant deficits will lead to higher inflation and lower productivity, and should be avoided. Deficits should only be used for occasional stabilization purposes. 
* Redirection of [[public spending]] from subsidies (especially what neoliberals call "indiscriminate subsidies") and other spending neoliberals deem wasteful toward broad-based provision of key pro-growth, pro-poor services like primary education, primary health care and [[infrastructure]] investment
* [[Tax reform]]– broadening the tax base and adopting moderate marginal tax rates to encourage innovation and efficiency;
* [[Interest rate]]s that are market determined and positive (but moderate) in real terms;
* Floating [[exchange rate]]s;
* [[Trade liberalization]]&nbsp;– liberalization of imports, with particular emphasis on elimination of quantitative restrictions (licensing, etc.); any trade protection to be provided by low and relatively uniform [[tariff]]s; thus encouraging competition and long term growth
* [[Liberalization]] of the "capital account" of the balance of payments, that is, allowing people the opportunity to invest funds overseas and allowing foreign funds to be invested in the home country
* [[Privatization]] of [[State-owned enterprise|state enterprise]]s; Promoting market provision of goods and services which the government cannot provide as effectively or efficiently, such as telecommunications, where having many service providers promotes choice and competition. 
* [[Deregulation]]&nbsp;– abolition of regulations that impede market entry or restrict competition, except for those justified on safety, environmental and consumer protection grounds, and prudent oversight of [[financial institution]]s;
* Legal security for [[property right]]s; and,
* [[Financialisation]] of capital.  . 

==Post-1970s economic liberalism== . 

===Global spread===. 
Neoliberalism ultimately developed through two major phases. The first phase carried out through the help of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]], and the second phase through [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Tony Blair]]. <ref>{{cite book|last=Steger|first=Manfred|title=Neoliberalism: A Very Short Introduction|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-956051-6|pages=21–50}}</ref> . 

Chronic economic crisis throughout the 1980s and the collapse of the [[Communist bloc]] at the end of the 1980s, helped foster political opposition to state interventionism in favor of unregulated market reform policies. From the 1980s onward, a number of communist and socialist countries initiated various neoliberal market reforms, such as the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] under the direction of [[Ante Marković]] (until the country's collapse in the early 1990s), and the [[People's Republic of China]] under the direction of [[Deng Xiaoping]].  . 

Changes occurred from the 1970s to the 1980s. Starting off with most of the democratic world, governments focused primarily on the primacy of economic individual rights, the rule of law and the role of governments in moderating relative unregulated trade. It was almost considered national self determination at the time.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} . 

The status of organized labour shifted when the governments of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher took strong stances to break down trade barriers entirely to reduce government power; thus allowing the market to be more important. Therefore industries will increasingly shift globally with integrated knowledge boosting the economy.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} . 

===Australia===. 
In Australia, neoliberal economic policies have been embraced by governments of both the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] and the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] since 1983. The governments of [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Paul Keating]] from 1983 to 1996 pursued economic liberalisation and a program of micro-economic reform.  These governments privatized government corporations, deregulated factor markets, floated the Australian dollar and reduced trade protection. <ref>Cameron Clyde R ''[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lab/86/cameron.html How the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party Lost Its Way]''</ref> . 

In addition to Labor's neoliberal agenda, Keating, as federal treasurer, also implemented a compulsory [[Superannuation in Australia|superannuation guarantee]] system in 1992 to increase national savings and reduce future government liability for old age pensions. <ref>Neilson L and Harris B ''[http://www.aph.gov.au/Library/pubs/BN/2008-09/Chron_Superannuation.htm Chronology of superannuation and retirement income in Australia] Parliamentary Library, Canberra, July 2008</ref>  The financing of universities was decentralised, requiring students to contribute to [[Tertiary education fees in Australia|university fees]] through a repayable loan system known as the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) and, in the mid 1990s, encouraging universities to increase income by admitting full-fee-paying students, including foreign students. <ref>Marginson S [http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=3310 Tertiary Education: A revolution to what end?]'' Online Opinion, 5 April 2005</ref>  The admitting of domestic full-fee-paying students to public universities was discontinued in 2009 by the Rudd Labor Government. <ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,,24571244-5005962,00.html | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> . 

When the Liberal Party returned to power in March 1996 under prime minister [[John Howard]], the programme of economic liberalisation was continued with the privatisation of more government corporations, notably the sale of the telecommunications provider [[Telstra]] and the Reserve Bank of Australia was made independent of the government in determining monetary policy. In addition to the neoliberal agenda, the Liberal government increased taxation through a 10% Goods and Services Tax [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|GST]] (similar to European [[VAT]]). It was introduced with the aim of combining and simplifying the previous duties and taxes and to flatten the tax base.  A series of reforms were enacted to empower capital in the labour market<ref>Saunders P ''[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UNSWLJ/2006/6.pdf Unleashing (Labour) Market Forces: the Social Policy Implications of Industrial Relations]'' University of New South Wales Law Journal, Vol 29(1) 2006</ref> but these reforms were largely through additional legislative restrictions on labour and not through labour market deregulation.  . 

===Canada===. 
In [[Canada]], the issues identified with neoliberalism (reducing taxes and welfare spending, minimizing of government and reform of public healthcare and education, among others) are often associated with [[Brian Mulroney]], [[Jean Chrétien]], [[Paul Martin]], [[Mike Harris]], [[Ralph Klein]], [[Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell]] and [[Stephen Harper]]. <ref>[http://politics.lilithezine.com/The-Neo-Liberal-Dogma-and-Canada.html The Neo-Liberal Dogma & Canada], The Politics eZine - Canada</ref> . 

[[Ralph Klein]], who supports and has supported extraction of [[Alberta]]'s vast oil and natural gas reserves, is credited by the [[Pembina Institute]] as generating a relatively small amount of provincial revenue compared to the increase in [[oil sand]] production. Between 1995 and 2004, production grew by 133%, but government revenue shrank by 30%, leaving large fortunes in the hands of corporations. <ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.pembina.org/op-ed/1217|title = Klein Shortchanging Albertans|author = Amy Taylor|publisher = Edmonton Journal}}</ref> . 

Under [[Mike Harris]] in Ontario during the 1990s, industry and social responsibilities were transferred to the cities. [[Toronto]] during this time was forced to amalgamate and enter a period of development. The [[Amalgamation of Toronto]] was intended as a cost-saving measure and, in 2000, Michael R. Garrett noted a yearly savings of $136.2 million (CDN)<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.toronto.ca/city_manager/amalgamation_3yearstatus.htm|title = Building the new City of Toronto:<br>Three year status report on amalgamation<br>January 1998-December 2000|author = Michael R. Garrett|publisher = City of Toronto}}</ref> However, in 2007, Barry Hertz reported in the conservative national newspaper National Post that cost savings never materialized. He also noted that government staff had grown, with the city employing 4,015 more people in 2007 than it did in 1998. <ref>{{cite web|url = http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/toronto/archive/2007/12/28/amalgamation-10-years-later.aspx|title = Amalgamation: 10 years later|author = Barry Hertz|publisher = National Post}}</ref> . 

Canadian politics were also affected. Trade tariffs were ended, allowing  less restrictions on trade. Government sizes were decreased limiting their power towards industries. <ref name="Adam Tickell 2002">Jamie Peck and Adam Tickell, “Neoliberalizing space,” Antipode 34 (2002): 380–404. </ref> The federal government rules during that time and municipalities had no power.  . 

===Chile===. 
[[Milton Friedman]] used the term "[[Miracle of Chile]]" in reference to [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s support for [[Economic liberalism|liberal economic]] changes in [[Chile]] carried out by the "[[Chicago Boys]]". Their implemented economic model had three main objectives: economic liberalization, privatization of state owned companies, and stabilization of inflation. These market-oriented economic policies were continued and strengthened by successive governments after Pinochet stepped down. <ref>Thomas M. Leonard. ''Encyclopedia Of The Developing World.'' Routledge. ISBN 1-57958-388-1 p. 322</ref> At the time, Milton Friedman stated that the Chilean experiment was "comparable to the economic miracle of post-war Germany."<ref name="DEPRESSION">Bello, W  and Kelly, J ''[http://multinationalmonitor.org/hyper/issues/1983/04/bello.html  The IMF and Chile: A Parting of Ways?]'' International Finance, The Multinational Monitor, April 1983, Volume 4, Number 4</ref> . 

Some of Pinochet's neoliberal policies were continued after the termination of his 17-year-long dictatorship, though with more social policies to counter the great social-economic inequality. <ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4000/is_200310/ai_n9310783/ Economic Reforms in Chile: From Dictatorship to Democracy, Latin American Politics and Society, Fall 2003 by Siavelis, Peter]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref><ref name="BBC-Chile">{{Cite news

The experience of Chile in the 1970s and 1980s, and especially the export of the Chilean pension model by former Labor Minister [[José Piñera]], has influenced the policies of the [[Communist Party of China]] and has been invoked as a model by economic reformers in other countries, such as [[Boris Yeltsin]] in Russia and almost all [[Eastern Europe]]an post-Communist societies. <ref name="HUDSON">{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/schaefer10202003.html |title=SCHAEFER, Standard.

Mining of [[copper]] in Chile is publicly owned (see [[Chilean nationalization of copper]]). Chile is the world's top producer of copper, which is by far the largest Chilean export good (accounting for over 40% of export revenue).  . 

=== Germany ===. 
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F015320-0010, Ludwig Erhard.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ludwig Erhard]]]] . 

Neoliberal economists such as [[Ludwig Erhard]] would use the theories he developed in the 1930s and 1940s and contribute to West Germany’s reconstruction after the Second World War. <ref name="Hartwich">[[Oliver Marc Hartwich]],[http://www.ort.edu.uy/facs/boletininternacionales/contenidos/68/neoliberalism68.pdf Neoliberalism: The Genesis of a Political Swearword], Centre for Independent Studies, 2009, ISBN 1-86432-185-7, p. 22</ref> Erhard was a member of the Mont Pelerin Society and in constant contact with other neoliberals. He pointed out that he is commonly classified as neoliberal and that he accepts this classification. <ref>Ludwig Erhard, [http://www.franz-oppenheimer.de/le64a.htm Franz Oppenheimer, dem Lehrer und Freund], In: Ludwig Erhard, Gedanken aus fünf Jahrzehnten, Reden und Schriften, hrsg. v.

VS Verlag, 2004, ISBN 3-8100-4111-4 S. 62</ref> Hayek did not like the expression “social market economy” but he noticed 1976 that some of his friends in Germany have succeeded in implementing the sort of social order for which he is pleading by using it. [[Ludwig von Mises]] stated despite some controversy at the Mont Pelerin Society that Erhard and Müller-Armack accomplished a great act of liberalism to restore the German economy and called this “a lesson for the US”. <ref>Ralf Ptak, Vom Ordoliberalismus zur Sozialen Marktwirtschaft: Stationen des Neoliberalismus in Deutschland, 2004, p. 18-19</ref> Although Erhard had always emphasized that the market was inherently social and did not need to be made so, in political practice the German [[welfare state]] which had been established under [[Otto von Bismarck]], became increasingly costly. Rüstow who coined the label “neoliberalism” at the [[Colloque Walter Lippmann]] criticized that development tendency and pressed for a more restrictive social policy. <ref name="Hartwich" /> . 

===Hong Kong===. 
[[Image:Hong Kong Night Skyline.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Hong Kong]] practices relatively ''laissez-faire'' policies.]]
[[Milton Friedman]] described [[Hong Kong]] as a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' state and he credits that policy for the rapid move from poverty to prosperity in 50 years. <ref>[http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/3532186.html The Hong Kong Experiment by Milton Friedman] on [[Hoover Digest]] accessed at March 29, 2007</ref> Hong Kong's GDP grew rapidly under British colonial control between 1897 and 1997, while possessing some government intervention in the form of [[Monetary authority|monetary]], school and environmental regulations and some government ownership of housing. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=284&Itemid=34%20 |title=Milton Friedmanâ€™s Hong Kong Misconceptions |publisher=Asia Sentinel |date= |accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref> These regulations were however light in comparison to many other countries, and in terms of economic regulation Friedman's analysis of Hong Kong as a 'laissez-faire' state seems justified: Hong Kong has no capital gains tax, no interest tax, no sales tax and only a 15% flat income tax. It also has no tariffs or other legal restrictions on international trade, no minimum wage laws (until 2010) and no price or wage controls. Further it extends no unemployment benefits, enacts no labour legislation, provides no social security and no national health insurance. <ref>{{cite book|title=The Capitalist Manifesto: The Economic, Historic and Philosophic Case for Laissez-faire|last=Bernstein|first=Andrew|page=326|publisher=University Press of America|year=2005|isbn=0-7618-3221-1}}</ref> . 

A 1994 [[World Bank Group|World Bank]] report stated that Hong Kong's GDP per capita grew in real terms at an annual rate of 6.5% from 1965 to 1989, a consistent growth percentage over a span of almost 25 years<ref>Rowley C & Fitzgerald R ''Managed in Hong Kong: Adaptive Systems, Entrepreneurship and Human Resources''  Routledge, UK, 2000.

===Japan===. 
[[Image:Junichiro Koizumi (cropped) during arrival ceremony on South Lawn of White House.jpg|thumb|120px|left|[[Junichiro Koizumi]], a popular Japanese leader who fought for privatization.]] . 

The largest [[privatization]] in history was that of [[Japan Post]]. It was the nation's largest employer and one third of all Japanese government employees worked for Japan Post.  . 

In September 2003, Koizumi's cabinet proposed splitting Japan Post into four separate companies: a bank, an insurance company, a postal service company, and a fourth company to handle the post offices as retail storefronts of the other three.

===Mexico===. 
Mexico is presently the eighth largest trading nation.  Mexico joined GATT, or General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1986 and has been a part of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) since 1990.  Another trading partnership Mexico entered into was the Uruguay Round (UR).  . 

The reforms brought about by NAFTA resulted in a huge opening of the Mexican economy and “ increased the political and economic costs of trade policy reversals and restrained trade policy with other countries to compatibility with (if not subservience to) NAFTA,” (Mena, 48). Tariffs were reduced across most sectors of the economy.  They also opened the door for factories along the border of the US and Mexico.  Maquiladoras account for most of the Mexican export market.  A reform of the 1973 Foreign Investment Law, “Foreign Investment is not allowed in oil production or refining.” (Mena, p.&nbsp;49).  . 

Mexico benefited greatly from its relationship with the UR and the WTO.  There were low tariffs on Mexican goods and Mexico was not bound to alter its tariffs for UR members.  “Mexico’s preferences on non-agricultural subsidies were largely borne out in the URAs,”  (Ortiz Mena, 60). Mexico continues to have restrictions on foreign ownership and has been criticized for not signing the [[Agreement on Government Procurement]].  NGOs are also critical of the reforms that had been made.  . 

After joining NAFTA, Mexico entered into over thirty Free Trade Agreements (FTA).  Mexico also signed FTAs with the European Union (EU), European Free Trade Agreement (EFTA) and Japan.  As a result of these agreements, exports increased, manufactured goods became more important and Mexico became the US’s second largest trading partner.  . 

The Mexican government feels that the benefits of liberalism have been slowed due to a lack of implementations of URA policies by developed countries.  The government fears that environmental and labor issues might affect the trade agenda.  They are looking to the developed nations to help with a clean transition to the post-Doha work program.  There are eleven areas that Mexico will focus on in the future:  agriculture, export subsidies, TRIM, Service, IPR, dispute settlements, FDI, competition policy, government procurement, industrial goods, and labor and environment.  Also, Mexico seeks to improve access for its important exports by complying fully with URAs. <ref>Ortiz Mena, Antonio. 2004. “A Regional Player in Multilateral Trade Negotiations.” In Trade Policy Reforms in Latin America. Pgs. 47-71</ref> . 

===New Zealand===. 
The term [[Rogernomics]] was created by analogy with [[Reaganomics]] to describe the [[economic reform|economic policies]] followed by New Zealand [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Finance Minister]] [[Roger Douglas]] from his appointment in 1984.  . 

The policies included cutting agricultural subsidies and trade barriers, [[privatisation|privatising]] public assets and the control of [[inflation]] through measures rooted in [[monetarism]], and were regarded by many as a betrayal of traditional Labour ideals. The Labour Party subsequently retreated from pure Rogernomics, which became a core doctrine of the more right-wing [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] party. Roger Douglas planned to create a 15% flat tax in New Zealand, and to privatise schools, roads and hospitals, which was moderated by the Labour cabinet at the time,<ref>Lange, David. ''My Life.''(2005) Viking. Auckland. </ref> although the resultant reforms were still generally considered radical in a global context. After Douglas left the Labour party, he went on to co-found ACT in 1993, which regards itself as the new liberal party of New Zealand.  . 

Since 1984, government subsidies including those for agriculture have been eliminated; import regulations have been reduced; exchange rates have been floated; controls on [[interest rates]], wages, and prices have been removed; and marginal rates of taxation reduced. Tight monetary policy and major efforts to reduce the government budget deficit brought the inflation rate down from an annual rate of more than 18% in 1987. The Deregulation of government-owned enterprises in the 1980s and 1990s reduced government's role in the economy and permitted the retirement of some [[public debt]], but simultaneously massively increased the necessity for greater [[welfare state|welfare spending]] and has led to considerably higher rates of [[unemployment]] than were standard in New Zealand in earlier decades. However, unemployment in New Zealand lowered again by 2006-2007, hovering around 3.5% to 4%.  . 

Deregulation created a very business-friendly regulatory framework. A survey 2008 study ranked it 99.9% in "Business freedom", and 80% overall in "Economic freedom", noting amongst other things that it only takes 12 days to establish a business in New Zealand on average, compared with a worldwide average of 43 days. Other indicators measured were property rights, labour market conditions, government controls and corruption, the last being considered "next to non-existent" in the [[Heritage Foundation]] and ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' study. <ref>{{cite news

===South Africa===. 
South Africa’s GDP has grown since the beginning of the new government system in 1994, which ended the rule of apartheid in South Africa.  While some see the implementation of neoliberal policies inside South Africa as having spurred the country's growth rate, others cite policies such as maintaining high interests rates to quell inflation as actually hurting economic growth.  Meanwhile, the implementation of GEAR (Growth Employment and Redistribution Strategy) policies have caused a decline in employment that started after the new government in 1994, which caused an increase in South Africa's poverty level. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article1088 |title=Resistance to neoliberalism, Josep María Antentas |publisher=Internationalviewpoint.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref> .

Thatcher's political and economic philosophy emphasised reduced state intervention as well as [[free market]]s and "[[entrepreneur]]ialism". <ref name="Raymond Plant 2009"/> She vowed to end excessive government interference in the economy and attempted to do this through privatizing nationally owned enterprises. After the [[James Callaghan]] government had concluded that the [[Keynesian]] approach to demand-side management failed, Thatcher felt that the economy was not self-righting and that new fiscal judgements had to be made to concentrate on inflation. <ref>Blackaby, F.T.

She also placed limits on the printing of money and legal restrictions on trade unions.  . 

By January 1982 the inflation rate had fallen to 8.6% from earlier peaks of 18%. By 1983 overall economic growth was stronger, while inflation and mortgage rates were at their lowest levels since 1970. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/CCI/article.asp?ID=1296|publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]]|accessdate=13 June 2008|title=Consumer Price Inflation: 1947 to 2004}}</ref> The term "[[Thatcherism]]" came to refer to her policies as well as aspects of her ethical outlook and personal style, including [[moral absolutism]], nationalism, focus on individuals rather than society as a whole and an uncompromising approach to achieving political goals.  . 

After the 1983 election, the Conservative majority expanded, Thatcher continued to enact her economic policies. <ref name="msn"/> The UK government sold most of the state's large utilities. <ref name="msn"/> The policy of [[Privatization|privatisation]] was a main component of Thatcherism. When Thatcher was forced to resign as British Prime Minister in 1990 British economic growth was on average higher than the other large EU economies (Germany, France and Italy).  . 

The price of these economic policies was a temporary and dramatic increase in unemployment that embarrassed the Thatcher government so much that the definition of unemployment was changed 31 times in order to come up with lower figures. Despite this, the official rate of unemployment in the United Kingdom increased to 9.1% in the years 1979-89 after it had been 3.4% between 1973 and 1979 and 1.9% between 1960 and 1973. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=BDe9IiwPm4EC&pg=PA30&lpg=PA30&dq=%2B%22united+kingdom%22%2B%22unemployment%22%2B%22thatcher%22%2B%221982%22&source=bl&ots=zk9XIUfBpQ&sig=Z6NQGq_STCppGNmGRE4bKYtGk68&hl=en&ei=pNOJS42XB5Hh8Qby-tjDDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CAgQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=%2B%22united%20kingdom%22%2B%22unemployment%22%2B%22thatcher%22%2B%221982%22&f=false |title=Thatcher and Thatcherism, Eric J.

[[Neil Kinnock]], leader of the Labour Party from 1983 to 1992, initiated Labour's rightward shift across the political spectrum by concurring largely with the economic policies of the Thatcher governments.

[[Peter Gowan]] has argued that the United States has been the main force behind the adoption of neoliberal policies in the rest of the world. The basic argument is that since the dollar is the international reserve currency, American banks are at a competitive advantage with respect to non-American banks, which cannot directly lend in dollars, so that their operations involve more foreign exchange risk. (Since the dollar is the international exchange currency, most international reserves are held as dollars, and the price of commodities such as oil are set in dollars, it is in general less risky to hold dollars than to hold other currencies, in the short term, at least.) Thus, once the United States liberalized its financial markets and controls over its banking industry, other countries were forced to follow suit. <ref>{{harv |Gowan|1999| pp=25–33}}</ref> . 

==Reach and effects==. 
===Effects in Latin American urbanization===. 
Between the 1930s and the late 1970s most countries in Latin America used the [[import substitution industrialization]] model (ISI) to build industry and reduce the dependency on imports from foreign countries. The result of ISI in these countries included rapid urbanization of one or two major cities, a growing urban population of the working class, and frequent protests by trade unions and left-wing parties. <ref name="one1">Portes, Alejandro, and Bryan R. Roberts. "The Free-market City: Latin American  Urbanization in the Years of the Neoliberal Experiment." Studies in Comparative International Development (2005): 43-82</ref> In response to the economic crisis, the leaders of these countries quickly adopted and implemented new neoliberal policies due to prospect theory.  . 

A study based on the transformations of urban life and systems as a result of neoliberalism in six countries of Latin America was published by Alejandro Portes and Bryan Roberts. This comparative study included census data analysis, surveying, and fieldwork focused in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay. Predictions of the neoliberalism were extended to these six countries in four areas: urban systems and primacy, urban unemployment and informal employment, urban inequality and poverty, and urban crime and victimization.  Data collected support a relationship between the economic policies of neoliberalism and the resulting patterns of urbanization.  . 

In the area of urban systems and primacy two tendencies were revealed in the data. The first was continuing growth in total size of urban populations while the second tendency was the decline in size of the principal city with decreased migration flows to these cities. Therefore, when calculating the urban growth rate each of these countries all showed minimal or a significant decline in growth. Portes and Roberts theorize that the changes are due to the “loss of attraction of major cities...due to a complex set of factors, but is undoubtedly a related to the end of the ISI era”. <ref name="one1" /> Although the relationship between the open-market and the transformation of urban systems has not been proven to be a perfect one-to-one relationship, the evidence supports the acceleration or initiation of these two tendencies following neoliberal changes. <ref name="one1" /> . 

There was also a variation in the inequality and poverty in the six countries. While the majority of the population within these countries suffered from poverty, the "upper classes" received the benefits of the neoliberal system. According to Portes and Roberts, “the ‘privileged decile’ received average incomes equivalent to fourteen times the average Latin American poverty-line income”. <ref name="one1" /> According to the authors, a direct result of the income inequality is that each country struggled with increased crime and victimization in both urban and suburban settings. However, due to corruption within the police force it is not possible to accurately extrapolate a trend in the data of crime and victimization. <ref name="one1" /> . 

==Support==. 
===Political freedom=== . 

In ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'' (1962), Friedman developed the argument that economic freedom, while itself an extremely important component of total freedom, is also a necessary condition for political freedom. He commented that [[centrally planned economy|centralized control of economic activities]] was always accompanied with political repression.  . 

In his view, the voluntary character of all transactions in an unregulated market economy and wide diversity that it permits are fundamental threats to repressive political leaders and greatly diminish power to coerce. Through elimination of centralized control of economic activities, economic power is separated from political power, and the one can serve as counterbalance to the other. Friedman feels that competitive capitalism is especially important to minority groups, since impersonal market forces protect people from discrimination in their economic activities for reasons unrelated to their productivity. <ref>Milton Friedman. ''Capitalism and freedom''. (2002). The University of Chicago. ISBN 0-226-26421-1 p.8-21</ref> . 

It is important to take into account, however, that an early neoliberal regime was attempted in Chile under what some would consider a military dictatorship and severe social repression. Chile now enjoys the highest rate of GDP per capita in Latin America; this lends strong credence to the assertion that economic freedom is more important to prosperity than are democratic institutions. Also, increased economic freedom put pressure on the dictatorship over time and increased political freedom. In ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', Hayek argued that "Economic control is not merely control of a sector of human life which can be separated from the rest; it is the control of the means for all our ends."<ref>[[Friedrich Hayek]], ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', University Of Chicago Press; 50th Anniversary edition (1944), ISBN 0-226-32061-8 p.95</ref> . 

==Opposition==. 
Opponents of neoliberalism argue the following points:
* Globalization can subvert nations' ability for self-determination. 
* Neoliberalism as a form of capitalism increases productivity but erodes the conditions in which production occurs long term, i.e., resources/nature, requiring expansion into new areas. It is therefore not sustainable within the world's limited geographical space. <ref>Moore, Jason W.(2011) 'Transcending the metabolic rift: a theory of crises in the capitalist worldecology',
Journal of Peasant Studies, 38: 1, 1 — 46</ref>
* Exploitation: critics consider neo-liberal economics to promote exploitation. 
* Negative economic consequences: Critics argue that neo-liberal policies produce inequality. 
* Increase in corporate power: some organizations believe neoliberalism, unlike liberalism, changes economic and government policies to increase the power of corporations, and a shift to benefit the upper classes. <ref>Yes! Magazine&nbsp;— Fall 2007 issue&nbsp;— page 4, editor's comments. Yes! Magazine is a "pro-sustainability" magazine. </ref>
* There are terrains of struggles for neoliberalism locally and socially. Urban citizens are increasingly deprived of the power to shape the basic conditions of daily life. <ref name="Adam Tickell 2002"/>
* Trade-led, unregulated economic activity and lax state regulation of pollution lead to environmental impacts or degradation. <ref>Peet, Richard. "Neoliberalism and Nature: The Case of the WTO". Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Vol 590 November 2003: 188-211. </ref>
* Deregulation of the labor market produces flexibilization and casualization of labor, greater informal employment, and a considerable increase in industrial accidents and occupational diseases. <ref>Feo, Oscar. "Venezuelan Health Reform, Neoliberal Policies and their Impact on Public Health Education: Observations on the Venezuelan Experience". Social Medicine, Vol 3 Number 4 November 2008: 224. </ref> . 

Critics sometimes refer to neoliberalism  as the "American Model," and make the claim that it promotes low wages and high inequality. <ref>Howell, David R. and Mamadou Diallo. 2007. "Charting U.S. Economic Performance with Alternative Labor Market Indicators: The Importance of Accounting for Job Quality." SCEPA Working Paper 2007-6. </ref> According to the economists Howell and Diallo (2007), neoliberal policies have contributed to a U.S. economy in which 30% of workers earn low wages (less than two-thirds the median wage for full-time workers), and 35% of the labor force is underemployed; only 40% of the working-age population in the U.S. is adequately employed. The Center for Economic Policy Research's (CEPR) Dean Baker (2006) argued that the driving force behind rising inequality in the U.S. has been a series of deliberate, neoliberal policy choices including anti-inflationary bias, anti-[[Trade union|unionism]], and profiteering in the health industry. <ref>Baker, Dean. 2006. "Increasing Inequality in the United States.[http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue40/Baker40.pdf]" Post-autistic Economics Review 40. </ref> However, countries have applied neoliberal policies at varying levels of intensity; for example, the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) has calculated that only 6% of Swedish workers are beset with wages it considers low, and that Swedish wages are overall lower due to their lack of neoliberal policies<ref>OECD. 2007. “[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/29/27/38749309.pdf OECD Employment Outlook. Statistical Annex].”</ref>  John Schmitt and Ben Zipperer (2006) of the CEPR have analyzed the effects of intensive Anglo-American neoliberal policies in comparison to continental European neoliberalism, concluding "The U.S. economic and social model is associated with substantial levels of social exclusion, including high levels of income inequality, high relative and absolute poverty rates, poor and unequal educational outcomes, poor health outcomes, and high rates of crime and incarceration. At the same time, the available evidence provides little support for the view that U.S.-style labor-market flexibility dramatically improves labor-market outcomes. Despite popular prejudices to the contrary, the U.S. economy consistently affords a lower level of [[economic mobility]] than all the continental European countries for which data is available."<ref>Schmitt, John and Ben Zipperer. 2006. "[http://www.cepr.net/documents/social_exclusion_2006_08.pdf Is the U.S. a Good Model for Reducing Social Exclusion in Europe?]" Post-autistic Economics Review 40. </ref> . 

Notable critics of neoliberalism in theory or practice include economists [[Joseph Stiglitz]], [[Amartya Sen]], and [[Robert Pollin]],<ref>{{harv|Pollin|2003}}</ref> linguist [[Noam Chomsky]],<ref>''Profit Over People: Neoliberalism and Global Order''. Seven Stories Press. November 1998. ISBN 1-888363-82-7</ref> geographer [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]],<ref name="Harvey 2005"/> and the [[alter-globalization]] movement in general, including groups such as [[ATTAC]]. Critics of neoliberalism argue that not only is neoliberalism's critique of socialism (as unfreedom) wrong, but neoliberalism cannot deliver the liberty that is supposed to be one of its strong points. Daniel Brook's "The Trap" (2007), Robert Frank's "Falling Behind" (2007), Robert Chernomas and Ian Hudson's "Social Murder" (2007), and Richard G. Wilkinson's "The Impact of Inequality" (2005) all claim high inequality is spurred by neoliberal policies and produces profound political, social, economic, health, and environmental constraints and problems. The economists and policy analysts at the [[Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives]] (CCPA) offer inequality-reducing [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policy alternatives to neoliberal policies.  . 

Santa Cruz History of Consciousness professor [[Angela Davis]] and Princeton sociologist Bruce Western have claimed that the high rate (compared to Europe) of [[incarceration]] in the U.S.&nbsp;– specifically 1 in 37 American adults is in the prison system&nbsp;– heavily promoted by the Clinton administration, is the neoliberal U.S. policy tool for keeping unemployment statistics low, while stimulating economic growth through the maintenance of a contemporary slave population and the promotion of prison construction and "militarized policing."<ref>Western, Bruce. 2006. Punishment and Inequality in America. New York: Russell Sage Foundation. </ref> The Clinton Administration also embraced neoliberalism by pursuing international trade agreements that would benefit the corporate sector globally (normalization of trade with [[People's Republic of China|China]] for example). Domestically, Clinton fostered such neoliberal reforms as the corporate takeover of health care in the form of the [[Health maintenance organization|HMO]], the reduction of welfare subsidies, and the implementation of "[[Workfare]]". <ref>{{Cite book|author=Kenneth J. Saltman |title=The Edison Schools: Corporate Schooling and the Assault on Public Education |pages=184–185 |year=2005 |publisher=[[Routledge]]}}</ref> . 

Neoliberal policies advanced by supranational organizations have come under criticism, from both socialist and libertarian writers, for advancing a corporatist agenda. Rajesh Makwana, on the left, writes that “the World Bank and IMF, are major exponents of the neoliberal agenda” advancing corporate interests. <ref>Rajesh Makwana, ''Neoliberalism and Economic Globalization'', STWR, November 26, 2006, retrieved February 29, 2012, [http://www.stwr.org/globalization/neoliberalism-and-economic-globalization.html]</ref> [[Sheldon Richman]], editor of the libertarian journal, [[The Freeman]], also sees the IMF imposing “corporatist-flavored ‘neoliberalism’ on the troubled countries of the world.” The policies of spending cuts coupled with tax increases give “real market reform a bad name and set back the cause of genuine liberalism.” Paternalistic supranational bureaucrats foster “long-term dependency, perpetual indebtedness, moral hazard, and politicization, while discrediting market reform and forestalling revolutionary liberal change.”<ref>Sheldon Richman, ''End the IMF: What Is It Good For?'', The Freeman, May 20 2011, retrieved February 29, 2012, [http://www.thefreemanonline.org/columns/tgif/end-imf/]</ref> Free market economist [[Richard M. Salsman]] goes further and argues the IMF “is a destructive, crisis-generating global welfare agency that should be abolished.” <ref>Richard M. Salsman, ''Paying More Blood Money to the IMF'', The Ayn Rand Center for Individual Rights, March 8 1998, retrieved February 29, 2012, [http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=5268&news_iv_ctrl=1386]</ref> “In return for bailouts, countries must enact such measures as new taxes, high interest rates, nationalizations, deportations, and price controls.” Writing in [[Forbes]], E. D. Kain sees the IMF as "paving the way for international corporations entrance into various developing nations" and creating dependency. <ref>E. D. Kain, ''Should We Abolish the IMF?'' Forbes, May 20, 2011, retrieved February 29, 2012, [http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2011/05/20/should-we-abolish-the-imf/]</ref> He quotes [[Donald J. Boudreaux]] on the need to abolish the IMF.  .
