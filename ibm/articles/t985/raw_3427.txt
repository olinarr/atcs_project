'''Market fundamentalism''' (also known as '''free market fundamentalism''') is a negative term applied to a strong belief in the ability of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' or [[free market economy]] views or policies to solve economic and social problems. <ref name=LONGVIEW1>[http://www.longviewinstitute.org/projects/marketfundamentalism/marketfundamentalism Block,Fred. ''Market Fundamentalism'', Longview Institute]</ref>   . 

Critics of free market economy have used the term to denote what they perceive as a misguided belief, or deliberate deception, that [[free market]]s provide the greatest possible equity and prosperity,<ref name=LONGVIEW>[http://www.longviewinstitute.org/projects/moral/sorcerersapprentice Block,Fred. ''Reframing the Political Battle: Market Fundamentalism vs. Moral Economy.'', Longview Institute]</ref> and that any interference with the market process decreases social well being. Users of the term include adherents of [[Economic interventionism|interventionist]], [[mixed economy]] and [[protectionist]] positions,<ref name=MIRACLE>[http://www.bidstrup.com/economics.htm Bidstrup, Scott. ''Free Market Fundamentalism: Friedman, Pinochet and the "Chilean Miracle"'', Revised 10/15/02]</ref> as well as billionaires such as [[George Soros]],<ref name=WARNS>[http://www.wsws.org/articles/1998/dec1998/soro-d22.shtml Beams, Nick.

According to economist [[John Quiggin]], the standard features of "economic fundamentalist rhetoric" are "dogmatic" assertions and the claim that anyone who holds contrary views is not a real economist. <ref name=DOGMA>[[John Quiggin|Quiggin, John]]. ''Rationalism and Rationality in Economics'', 1999, On Line Opinion,www.onlineopinion.com.au</ref> [[John Ralston Saul]] claims this is simply a form of [[bullying]]. <ref name=BULLYING>SAUL, John Ralston. ''On Equilibrium'', Penguin Books, 2001 Canada</ref> This approach follows from evidence that [[neoclassical economics]] provides a scientific explanation of economic phenomena, an explanation that economists state represents the status of scientific truth (if, and only if, all of the [[Economics#Criticism_of_assumptions|assumptions]] involved in deriving the economic analysis are simultaneously satisfied). However, Kozul-Wright states in his book ''[[The Resistible Rise of Market Fundamentalism]]'' that "ineluctability of market forces" [[neo-liberal]]s and conservative politicians tend to stress, and their confidence on a chosen policy, rest on a "mixture of implicit and hidden [[Economics#Criticism_of_assumptions|assumptions]], myths about the history of their own countries' economic development, and special interests camouflaged in their rhetoric of general good". <ref name=RESISTIBLE>KOZUL-WRIGHT, Richard and RAYMENT, Paul.

==History of the term==. 
The expression "market fundamentalism" was popularized by business magnate and philanthropist [[George Soros]] in his book ''[[The Crisis of Global Capitalism]]'' (1998),<ref name=SOROS1>[http://www.dollarsandsense.org/archives/1999/0199breslow.html BRESLOW,Marc. ''George Soros: Beware Market Fundamentalism''. Dollars & Sense, issue #221, January-February 1999]</ref>  in which he writes "This idea was called [[laissez faire]] in the nineteenth century... I have found a better name for it: market fundamentalism.". <ref name=SOROS2>[http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Global_Economy/Crisis_Capitalism_Soros.html SOROS, George. ''The Crisis of Global Capitalism'' Public Affairs, 1998.]</ref>
[[P. Sainath]] believes [[Jeremy Seabrook]], a journalist and campaigner, first used the term. <ref name=FIRSTUSE>[http://www.india-seminar.com/2001/497/497%20p.%20sainath.htm  SAINATH,P. ''And then there was the market.'']</ref> The term was used by [[John Langmore]] and [[John Quiggin]] in their 1994 book ''Work for All''. <ref>{{cite web|last=Quiggin|first=John|title=WORK FOR ALL - REPLY|url=http://www.uq.edu.au/economics/johnquiggin/JournalArticles95/WFA95.html|accessdate=30 January 2012}}</ref> A full description of the origins of the free market economics dating as far back to the conception of natural laws as mathematical, eternal and absolute—a reflection of some perfect mathematical form—derived from ancient Greek philosophers [[Pythagoras]] (569–500 BC) and [[Plato]], and reinvigorated by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] is well beyond the scope of this article, but can be read on Chapter 4, [http://epress.anu.edu.au/cotm/pdf/whole_book.pdf ''A Brief Account of the Historical Origins of Economic Fundamentalism''], in Dr. Lee Boldman's book (2007). <ref name=HISTMKTFDNLSM>Boldeman, Dr. Lee. {{PDF|[http://epress.anu.edu.au/cotm/pdf/whole_book.pdf ''The cult of the market: economic fundamentalism and its discontents.'']|1.60&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 1687168 bytes -->}}. 2007, Canberra: The Australian National University ANU E Press. ISBN 9781921313530, p. 13</ref> . 

The expression is now used by various authors writing on economic topics to signify an allegedly unjustified belief in the ability of markets to solve all problems in a society. <ref name=DEFINITION>[http://www.123exp-beliefs.com/t/00804280297/ ''Market fundamentalism'' The Language of Philosophy - Dictionary and Research Guide, Enlexica, Inc.]</ref> The term has been used, pejoratively, to criticize some groups which are mainly viewed as advocating strongly against "any" state regulation and defend a "totally" free market. <ref name="DEFINITION"/> It is also used to disparage the arguments of the proponents of "the virtues of radical free-market economics" or, in Soros' own words, against the "[[ideology]]" which "has put financial capital into the driver's seat."<ref name="SOROS2"/> . 

[[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] used the term in his autobiographical essay in acceptance of [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] to criticize some [[International Monetary Fund]] policies: "More broadly, the IMF was advocating a set of policies which is generally referred to alternatively as the [[Washington consensus]], the neo-liberal doctrines, or market fundamentalism, based on an incorrect understanding of economic theory and (what I viewed) as an inadequate interpretation of the historical data." <ref name=STIGLITZ>[http://www.nobel.se/economics/laureates/2001/stiglitz-autobio.html Autobiographical essay in acceptance of the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]</ref> . 

{{cquote|The theories that I (and others) helped develop explained why unfettered markets often not only do not lead to social justice, but do not even produce efficient outcomes. Interestingly, there has been no intellectual challenge to the refutation of Adam Smith’s [[invisible hand]]: individuals and firms, in the pursuit of their self-interest, are not necessarily, or in general, led as if by an [[invisible hand]], to economic efficiency. <ref name=PACT>[http://www.beppegrillo.it/eng/2007/01/stiglitz.html STIGLITZ, Joseph E. ''The pact with the devil.'' Beppe Grillo's Friends interview]</ref>|4=[[Joseph E. Stiglitz]]}} . 

==History of the concept== . 

While the term market fundamentalism is relatively new (until 1950 there was no entry for "fundamentalism" in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]];<ref name=GIDDINSa>GIDDENS, Anthony. ''Beyond Left and Right. The Future of Radical Politics'', Introduction, First English Edition 1994, Brazilian Edition, 1995, p. 14, ISBN 8571391149</ref> the derivative ''fundamentalist'' was added only on its second 1989 edition, with the meaning: ''"an economic or political doctrinaire"'' <ref name=ORIGINOED>[http://dictionary.oed.com/ ''Oxford English Dictionary'', Oxford University Press, 2nd edition, 1989]</ref>), the concept of [[economic liberalism]] is not; the ideas were re-born in the 18th century, with the works of [[Adam Smith]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Say]]. <ref name="HISTMKTFDNLSM"/> It was only in the 20th century that the relative sophistication found in Smith’s work would be reformulated by economists such as [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Joseph Schumpeter]], and [[Milton Friedman]] (of the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School of economics]] of the 1960s and 1970s), resulting in a recipe for a free market economy: deregulate business and trade, restrict state intervention, and let the energies of entrepreneurship and free-flowing capital generate wealth for all of those who participate in the economy. <ref name=INGRAINED>[http://www.commondreams.org/views07/0130-22.htm Rosen, Ruth. ''Note to Nancy Pelosi: Challenge Market Fundamentalism.'', January 30, 2007]</ref> . 

After the influence of Friedman and the [[Chicago boys]] ([[University of Chicago]]-educated Chilean economists) on the [[Miracle of Chile]] under the [[Augusto Pinochet]] regime in the 1970s, similar models were adapted by Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] of the UK ([[Thatcherism]]) and President [[Ronald Reagan]] in the U.S. ([[Reaganomics]]) in the early 1980s. <ref name=RESISTING>AMBROSE, Soren. ''Resisting Market Fundamentalism! Ending the Reign of Extremist Neo-Liberalism.'' 50 Years Is Enough Network, April 2004</ref> . 

In the late 1980s the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]-based financial institutions, ([[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]]) and the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] embraced the [[Washington Consensus]], a standard set of policy prescriptions for [[economic crisis|crisis-wracked]] nations which include measures such as eliminating state subsidies, redirecting social spending into infrastructural development and reducing taxes,<ref>Williamson, John: [http://www.iie.com/publications/papers/paper.cfm?researchid=486 What Washington Means by Policy Reform], in: Williamson, John (ed.): ''Latin American Readjustment: How Much has Happened'', Washington: Institute for International Economics 1989</ref> or as [[Stiglitz]] summarized, promoted the proselytism of a universal set of economic policy recommendations: "stabilise, liberalise and privatise" (Stiglitz, 1998:21-22).  . 

==Fundamentalism and the financial markets== . 

In late 20th century [[United States]], every time that credit expansion coincided with economic difficulties, the government intervened, injecting liquidity and stimulating the economy. <ref name=WORSTCRISIS>[[George Soros|Soros, George]], [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/24f73610-c91e-11dc-9807-000077b07658.html "The worst market crisis in 60 years.]" ''[[Financial Times]]'', January 22, 2008 19:57]</ref> This system of 'asymmetric incentives' (also known as "[[moral hazard]]"), encouraged ever greater credit expansion, as its risks to financial institutions were mitigated by the state intervention. <ref name=WORSTCRISIS/> Financial regulations were progressively decreased in the United States from 1980 (when [[Ronald Reagan]] became President) until the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]].{{quote |[P]eople came to believe in what former US president Ronald Reagan called the ''magic of the marketplace'' and I call ''market fundamentalism''. ''Fundamentalists'' believe that markets tend towards equilibrium and the common interest is best served by allowing participants to pursue their self-interest. It is an obvious misconception, because it was the intervention of the authorities that prevented financial markets from breaking down, not the markets themselves. Nevertheless, market fundamentalism emerged as the dominant ideology in the 1980s, when financial markets started to become globalised and the US started to run a current account deficit. <ref name=WORSTCRISIS/>|[[George Soros]]}} . 

The worldwide [[financial crisis of 2007-2010]] is described by Joseph E. Stiglitz as ''the end of market fundamentalism'':
{{quote|In this sense, ''the fall of Wall Street is for market fundamentalism what the fall of the Berlin Wall was for communism''—it tells the world that this way of economic organization turns out not to be sustainable. In the end, everyone says, that model doesn't work. Actually the model only failed the citizens, while working perfectly in ensuring profits for the [[Wall Street]] financial groups that run the USA, so privatising gain and socialising the risk when the markets fail to work as hoped.    . 

This moment is a marker that the claims of financial market liberalization were bogus. <ref>Interview with Nathan Gardels, September 16th 2008 [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nathan-gardels/stiglitz-the-fall-of-wall_b_126911.html Source]</ref>|[[Joseph E.
