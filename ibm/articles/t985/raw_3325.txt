'''Privatization''' is the incidence or process of transferring ownership of a [[business]], enterprise, agency, public service or property from the [[public sector]] (the state or government) to the [[private sector]] (businesses that operate for a private profit) or to private [[non-profit organization]]s. The term is also used in a quite different sense, to mean government out-sourcing of services to private firms, e.g. functions like revenue collection, law enforcement, and prison management. <ref>Chowdhury, F. L. ‘’Corrupt Bureaucracy and Privatisation of Tax Enforcement’’, 2006: Pathak Samabesh, Dhaka. </ref> . 

The term "privatization" also has been used to describe two unrelated transactions. The first is a buyout, by the majority owner, of all shares of a [[public company|public corporation]] or [[holding company]]'s stock, privatizing a publicly traded stock, and often described as [[private equity]]. The second is a [[demutualization]] of a [[mutual organization]] or [[cooperative]] to form a [[joint stock company]]. <ref name="crisis">{{Cite news

Edwards states that ''[[The Economist]]'' coined the term in the 1930s in covering Nazi German economic policy. <ref>{{cite book | last = Edwards | first = Ruth Dudley | authorlink = Ruth Dudley Edwards | title = The Pursuit of Reason: The Economist 1843-1993 | page = 946 | publisher = Harvard Business School Press | year = 1995 | isbn = 0-87584-608-4 }}</ref><ref>Compare {{cite journal |last=Bel |first=Germà |year=2006 |title=Retrospectives: The Coining of 'Privatisation' and Germany's National Socialist Party |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=187–194 |doi=10.1257/jep.20.3.187}}</ref> . 

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] notes usage dating from 1942 in ''Econ. Jrnl'', 52, 398.  . 

==History==. 
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}
A long history of privatization dates from [[Ancient Greece]], when governments contracted out almost everything to the private sector. <ref name="handbook">''International Handbook on Privatization'' by David Parker, David S. Saal</ref> In the [[Roman Republic]] private individuals and companies performed the majority of services including tax collection ([[tax farming]]), army supplies ([[military contractor]]s), religious sacrifices and construction. However, the [[Roman Empire]] also created [[state-owned enterprise]]s—for example, much of the grain was eventually produced on estates owned by the Emperor. Some scholars suggest that the cost of bureaucracy was one of the reasons for the [[fall of the Roman Empire]]. <ref name="handbook"/> . 

Perhaps one of the first ideological movements towards privatization came during [[China]]'s golden age of the [[Han dynasty]]. [[Taoism]] came into prominence for the first time at a state level, and it advocated the [[laissez-faire]] principle of [[Wu wei]] (無為), literally meaning "do nothing". <ref>{{harvnb|Li|Zheng|2001|p=241}}</ref> The rulers were counseled by the Taoist clergy that a strong ruler was virtually invisible.  . 

During the [[Renaissance]], most of Europe was still by and large following the [[feudal]] economic model. By contrast, the [[Ming dynasty]] in [[China]] began once more to practice privatization, especially with regards to their manufacturing industries. This was a reversal of the earlier [[Song dynasty]] policies, which had themselves overturned earlier policies in favor of more rigorous state control. <ref>Bouye, Thomas M., Manslaughter, markets, and moral economy</ref> . 

In Britain, the privatization of common lands is referred to as [[enclosure]] (in Scotland as the [[Lowland Clearances]] and the [[Highland Clearances]]). Significant privatizations of this nature occurred from 1760 to 1820, coincident with the industrial revolution in that country.  . 

In more recent times, [[Winston Churchill]]'s government privatized the British steel industry in the 1950s, and [[West Germany]]'s government embarked on large-scale privatization, including selling its majority stake in [[Volkswagen]] to small investors in a public share offering in 1961. <ref name="handbook"/> In the 1970s [[Augusto Pinochet|General Pinochet]] implemented a significant privatization program in [[Chile]]. However, it was in the 1980s under the leaderships of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the [[UK]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] in the [[USA]], that privatization gained worldwide momentum. In the UK this culminated in the 1993 [[privatization of British Rail]] under Thatcher's successor, [[John Major]]; British Rail having been formed by prior nationalization of private rail companies.  . 

Significant privatization of state owned enterprises in Eastern and Central Europe and the former Soviet Union was undertaken in the 1990s with assistance from the World Bank, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the German [[Treuhand]], and other governmental and nongovernmental organizations.  . 

A major ongoing privatization, [[Japan Post#Postal privatization|that of Japan Post]], involves the Japanese post service and the largest bank in the world. This privatization, spearheaded by [[Junichiro Koizumi]], started in 2007 following generations of debate. The privatization process is expected{{By whom|date=April 2010}} to last until 2017.  . 

==Types==. 
There are four main methods{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} of privatization: . 

# [[Share issue privatization]] (SIP) - selling shares on the [[stock market]]
# [[Asset sale privatization]] - selling an entire organization (or part of it) to a strategic investor, usually by [[auction]] or by using the [[Treuhand]] model
# [[Voucher privatization]] - distributing shares of ownership to all citizens, usually for free or at a very low price. 
# [[Privatization from below]] - Start-up of new private businesses in formerly socialist countries.  . 

Choice of sale method is influenced by the [[capital market]], political and firm-specific factors. SIPs are more likely to be used when capital markets are less developed and there is lower [[income inequality]]. Share issues can broaden and deepen domestic capital markets, boosting [[liquidity]] and (potentially) [[economic growth]], but if the capital markets are insufficiently developed it may be difficult to find enough buyers, and transaction costs (e.g. underpricing required) may be higher. For this reason, many governments elect for listings in the more developed and liquid markets, for example [[Euronext]], and the [[London Stock Exchange|London]], [[New York Stock Exchange|New York]] and [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange|Hong Kong]] stock exchanges.  . 

As a result of higher political and currency risk deterring foreign investors, asset sales occur more commonly in [[developing countries]].  . 

Voucher privatization has mainly occurred in the [[transition economies]] of Central and Eastern Europe, such as [[Privatization in Russia|Russia]], [[Poland]], the [[Czech Republic]], and [[Slovakia]]. Additionally, Privatization from below is/has been an important type of economic growth in transition economies.  . 

A substantial benefit of share or asset-sale privatizations is that bidders compete to offer the highest price, creating income for the state in addition to tax revenues. Voucher privatizations, on the other hand, could be a genuine transfer of assets to the general population, creating a real sense of participation and inclusion. If the transfer of vouchers is permitted, a market in vouchers could be created, with companies offering to pay money for them.  .

many economists argue that these can be dealt with by appropriate government support through [[Redistribution (economics)|redistribution]] and perhaps [[retraining]].  . 

In sectors that are [[natural monopoly|natural monopolies]] or [[public services]] (such as, say, passenger rail in the United States), the results of privatization are much more mixed, as a private [[monopoly]] behaves much the same as a public one in [[Economic liberalism|liberal]] economic theory. The government is actually seen as a more natural provider of public goods and services. However, the efficiency of an existing public sector operation can be put into question requiring changes to be made. Changes may include, [[inter alia]], the imposition of related reforms such as greater transparency and accountability of management, an improved [[cost-benefit analysis]], improved internal controls, [[regulation|regulatory systems]], and better financing, rather than privatization itself.  . 

Regarding [[political corruption]], it is a controversial issue whether the size of the public sector per se results in corruption. The [[Nordic countries]] have low corruption but large public sectors. However, these countries score high on the [[Ease of Doing Business Index]], due to good and often simple regulations, and for [[Freedom in the World|political rights and civil liberties]], showing high government [[accountability]] and transparency. One should also notice the successful, corruption-free privatizations and restructuring of government enterprises in the Nordic countries. For example, dismantling telecommunications monopolies has resulted in several new players entering the market and intense competition with price and service.  . 

Also regarding corruption, the sales themselves give a large opportunity for grand corruption. Privatizations in Russia and Latin America were accompanied by large-scale corruption during the sale of the state-owned companies. Those with political connections unfairly gained large wealth, which has discredited privatization in these regions. While media have reported widely the grand corruption that accompanied the sales, studies have argued that in addition to increased operating efficiency, daily petty corruption is, or would be, larger without privatization, and that corruption is more prevalent in non-privatized sectors. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that extralegal and unofficial activities are more prevalent in countries that privatized less. <ref>Privatisation in Competitive Sectors: The Record to Date.

==Differing views==. 
===Supporting===. 
Studies show that private market factors can more efficiently deliver many goods or service than governments due to [[free market]] [[competition]]. <ref name=oecd/><ref name=nellis_kikeri/><ref name=megginson_netter/> Over time this tends to lead to lower prices, improved quality, more choices, less corruption, less red tape, and/or quicker delivery. Many proponents do not argue that everything should be privatized. According to them, [[market failure]]s and [[natural monopolies]] could be problematic. However, [[anarcho-capitalists]] prefer that every function of the state be privatized, including [[Private defense agency|defense]] and [[Alternative dispute resolution|dispute resolution]].  . 

The basic economic argument given for privatization states that governments have few [[incentives]] to ensure that the enterprises they own are well run. One problem is the lack of comparison in state monopolies. It is difficult to know if an enterprise is efficient or not without competitors to compare against. Another is that the central government administration, and the voters who elect them, have difficulty evaluating the efficiency of numerous and very different enterprises. A private owner, often specializing and gaining great knowledge about a certain industrial sector, can evaluate and then reward or punish the management in much fewer enterprises much more efficiently. Also, governments can raise money by taxation or simply printing money should revenues be insufficient, unlike a private owner.  . 

If private and state-owned enterprises compete against each other, then the state owned may borrow money more cheaply from the debt markets than private enterprises, since the state owned enterprises are ultimately backed by the taxation and printing press power of the state, gaining an unfair advantage.  . 

Privatizing a non-profitable state-owned company may force the company to raise prices in order to become profitable. However, this would remove the need for the state to provide tax money in order to cover the losses.  . 

Proponents of privatization {{Who|date=September 2010}} make the following arguments:
* Performance. State-run industries tend to be [[bureaucratic]]. A political government may only be motivated to improve a function when its poor performance becomes politically sensitive, and such an improvement can be reversed easily by another regime.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
* Increased efficiency. Private companies and firms have a greater incentive to produce more [[goods and services]] for the sake of reaching a [[customer base]] and hence increasing profits. A public organization would not be as productive due to the lack of financing allocated by the entire government's budget that must consider other areas of the economy. 
* Specialization. A private [[business]] has the ability to focus all relevant human and financial resources onto specific functions. A state-owned firm does not have the necessary resources to [[Departmentalization|specialize]] its goods and services as a result of the general products provided to the greatest number of people in the [[population]]. 
* Improvements. Conversely, the government may put off improvements due to political sensitivity and special interests&mdash;even in cases of companies that are run well and better serve their customers' needs. 
* Corruption. A state-monopolized function is prone to [[Political corruption|corruption]]; decisions are made primarily for political reasons, personal gain of the decision-maker (i.e. "graft"), rather than economic ones. Corruption (or [[principal-agent]] issues) in a state-run corporation affects the ongoing asset stream and company performance, whereas any corruption that may occur during the privatization process is a one-time event and does not affect ongoing cash flow or performance of the company. 
* Accountability. Managers of privately owned companies are accountable to their owners/shareholders and to the consumer, and can only exist and thrive where needs are met. Managers of publicly owned companies are required to be more accountable to the broader community and to political "stakeholders". This can reduce their ability to directly and specifically serve the needs of their customers, and can bias investment decisions away from otherwise profitable areas. 
* Civil-liberty concerns. A company controlled by the state may have access to information or assets which may be used against dissidents or any individuals who disagree with their policies. 
* Goals. A political government tends to run an industry or company for [[political]] goals rather than [[economic]] ones. 
* Capital. Privately held companies can sometimes more easily raise investment capital in the financial markets when such local markets exist and are suitably liquid. While interest rates for private companies are often higher than for government debt, this can serve as a useful constraint to promote efficient investments by private companies, instead of cross-subsidizing them with the overall credit-risk of the country. Investment decisions are then governed by market interest rates. State-owned industries have to compete with demands from other government departments and special interests. In either case, for smaller markets, [[political risk]] may add substantially to the cost of capital. 
* Security. Governments have had the tendency to "bail out" poorly run businesses, often due to the sensitivity of job losses, when economically, it may be better to let the business fold. 
* Lack of market discipline. Poorly managed state companies are insulated from the same discipline as private companies, which could go bankrupt, have their management removed, or be taken over by competitors. Private companies are also able to take greater risks and then seek bankruptcy protection against creditors if those risks turn sour. 
* Natural monopolies. The existence of [[natural monopolies]] does not mean that these sectors must be state owned. Governments can enact or are armed with [[anti-trust legislation]] and bodies to deal with anti-competitive behavior of all companies public or private. 
* Concentration of wealth. Ownership of and profits from successful enterprises tend to be dispersed and diversified -particularly in voucher privatization. The availability of more investment vehicles stimulates capital markets and promotes liquidity and job creation. 
* Political influence. Nationalized industries are prone to interference from [[politicians]] for [[political]] or [[Populism|populist]] reasons. Examples include making an industry buy supplies from local producers (when that may be more expensive than buying from abroad), forcing an industry to freeze its prices/fares to satisfy the electorate or control [[inflation]], increasing its staffing to reduce [[unemployment]], or moving its operations to [[constituency|marginal constituencies]]. 
* Profits. Corporations exist to generate profits for their shareholders. Private companies make a profit by enticing [[consumer]]s to buy their products in preference to their competitors' (or by increasing [[primary demand]] for their products, or by reducing costs). Private corporations typically profit more if they serve the needs of their clients well. Corporations of different sizes may target different market niches in order to focus on marginal groups and satisfy their demand. A company with good [[corporate governance]] will therefore be incentivized to meet the needs of its customers efficiently. 
* Job gains. As the economy becomes more efficient, more profits are obtained and no government subsidies and less taxes are needed, there will be more private money available for investments and consumption and more profitable and better-paid jobs will be created than in the case of a more regulated economy. <ref>[http://www.heritage.org/research/europe/HL352.cfm Central Europe's Mass-Production Privatization], Heritage Lecture #352</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=July 2010}} . 

===Opposing===. 
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2011}}
Opponents of certain privatizations believe that certain [[Public good|public goods and services]] should remain primarily in the hands of government in order to ensure that everyone in society has access to them (such as law enforcement, basic [[health care]], and basic [[education]]). There is a [[positive externality]] when the government provides society at large with public goods and services such as [[National security|defense]] and disease control. Some national constitutions in effect define their governments' "core businesses" as being the provision of such things as justice, tranquility, defense, and general welfare. These governments' direct provision of security, stability, and safety, is intended to be done for the common good (in the public interest) with a long-term (for posterity) perspective.  As for [[natural monopolies]], opponents of privatisation claim that they aren't subject to fair competition, and better administrated by the state. Likewise, [[Private good|private goods and services]] should remain in the hands of the private sector.  . 

Many privatization opponents {{Who|date=September 2010}} also warn against the practice's inherent tendency toward corruption. As many areas which the government could provide are essentially profitless, the only way private companies could, to any degree, operate them would be through contracts or block payments. In these cases, the private firm's performance in a particular project would be removed from their performance, and embezzlement and dangerous cost-cutting measures might be taken to maximize profits.  . 

Some{{Who|date=April 2010}} would also point out that privatizing certain functions of government might hamper coordination, and charge firms with specialized and limited capabilities to perform functions which they are not suited for. In rebuilding a war torn nation's infrastructure, for example, a private firm would, in order to provide security, either have to hire security, which would be both necessarily limited and complicate their functions, or coordinate with government, which, due to a lack of command structure shared between firm and government, might be difficult. A government agency, on the other hand, would have the entire military of a nation to draw upon for security, whose chain of command is clearly defined. Opponents would say that this is a false assertion: numerous books refer to poor organization between government departments (for example the Hurricane Katrina incident).  . 

Although private companies will provide a similar good or service alongside the government, opponents of privatization are careful about completely transferring the provision of public goods, services and assets into private hands for the following reasons:
* Performance. A democratically elected government is accountable to the people through a legislature, Congress or [[Parliament]], and is motivated to safeguarding the assets of the nation. The profit motive may be subordinated to social objectives. 
* Improvements. the government is motivated to performance improvements as well run businesses contribute to the State's revenues. 
* Corruption. Government ministers and civil servants are bound to uphold the highest ethical standards, and standards of probity are guaranteed through codes of conduct and declarations of interest. However, the selling process could lack transparency, allowing the purchaser and civil servants controlling the sale to gain personally. 
* Accountability. The public does not have any control or oversight of private companies. 
* Civil-liberty concerns. A democratically elected government is accountable to the people through a [[parliament]], and can intervene when civil liberties are threatened. 
* Goals. The government may seek to use state companies as instruments to further social goals for the benefit of the nation as a whole. 
* Capital. Governments can raise money in the financial markets most cheaply to re-lend to state-owned enterprises. 
* Strategic and Sensitive areas. Governments have chosen to keep certain companies/industries under public control because of their strategic importance or sensitive nature. 
* Cuts in essential services. If a government-owned company providing an essential service (such as the water supply) to all citizens is privatized, its new owner(s) could lead to the abandoning of the social obligation to those who are less able to pay, or to regions where this service is unprofitable. 
* Natural monopolies. Privatization will not result in true competition if a [[natural monopoly]] exists. 
* Concentration of wealth. Profits from successful enterprises end up in private, often foreign, hands instead of being available for the common good. 
* Political influence. Governments may more easily exert pressure on state-owned firms to help implementing government policy. 
* Downsizing. Private companies often face a conflict between profitability and service levels, and could over-react to short-term events. A state-owned company might have a longer-term view, and thus be less likely to cut back on maintenance or staff costs, training etc., to stem short term losses. Many private companies have downsized while making record profits. 
* Profit. Private companies do not have any goal other than to maximize profits. A private company will serve the needs of those who are most willing (and able) to pay, as opposed to the needs of the majority, and are thus anti-democratic. The more [[necessity good|necessary a good]] is, the lower the [[price elasticity of demand#Elasticity and revenue|price elasticity of demand]], as people will attempt to buy it no matter the price. In the case of price elasticity of demand is zero (perfectly inelastic good), demand part of supply and demand theories does not work. 
* Privatization and Poverty. It is acknowledged by many studies that there are winners and losers with privatization. The number of losers —which may add up to the size and severity of poverty—can be unexpectedly large if the method and process of privatization and how it is implemented are seriously flawed (e.g. lack of transparency leading to state-owned assets being appropriated at minuscule amounts by those with political connections, absence of regulatory institutions leading to transfer of monopoly rents from public to private sector, improper design and inadequate control of the privatization process leading to [[asset stripping]]. <ref>Dagdeviren (2006) "Revisiting privatisation in the context of poverty alleviation" Journal of International Development, Vol. 18, 469–488</ref>
* Job Loss. Due to the additional financial burden placed on privatized companies to succeed without any government help, unlike the public companies, jobs could be lost to keep more money in the company.  . 

=== Equivalence to secured borrowing ===. 
Setting aside questions of efficiency and public versus private control of resources, some privatization transactions can be interpreted as a form of a [[secured loan]],<ref name="roin">{{Cite journal

It is argued that this is motivated by "politicians' desires to borrow money surreptitiously",<ref name="roin"/> due to legal restrictions on and political resistance to alternative sources of revenue, viz, raising taxes or issuing debt.  . 

==Intermediate views==. 
Others don't dispute that well-run for-profit entities with sound [[corporate governance]] may be considerably more efficient than an inefficient governmental [[bureaucracy]] or [[NGO]], however many '''implementations''' of privatization can - in practice - lead to the [[fire sale]] of public assets, and/or to inefficient or corrupt - for profit management.  . 

===Developed or minimally corrupt economies===. 
A top executive can readily '''reduce''' the perceived value of an asset – due to [[information asymmetry]]. The executive can accelerate accounting of expected expenses, delay accounting of expected revenue, engage in [[off balance sheet]] transactions to make the company's profitability appear temporarily poorer, or simply promote and report severely conservative (e.g. pessimistic) estimates of future earnings. Such seemingly adverse earnings news will be likely to (at least temporarily) reduce sale price. (This is again due to [[information asymmetries]] since it is more common for top executives to do everything they can to [[window dress]] their earnings forecasts). There are typically very few legal risks to being 'too conservative' in one's accounting and earnings estimates.  . 

When the entity gets taken private - at a dramatically lower price - the new private owner gains a windfall from the former top executive's actions to (surreptitiously) reduce the sales price. This can represent tens of billions of dollars (questionably) transferred from previous owners (the public) to the takeover artist. The former top executive is then rewarded with a [[golden handshake]] for presiding over the [[fire sale]] that can sometimes be in the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars for one or two years of work. (This is nevertheless an excellent bargain for the takeover artist, who will tend to benefit from developing a [[reputation]] of being very generous to parting top executives).  . 

When a publicly held asset, [[mutual organization|mutual]] or [[non-profit organization]] undergoes privatization, top executives often reap tremendous monetary benefits. The executives can facilitate the process by making the entity appear to be in financial crisis - this reduces the sale price (to the profit of the purchaser), and makes non-profits and governments more likely to sell.  . 

Ironically, it can also contribute to a public perception that private entities are more efficiently run reinforcing the political will to sell of public assets. Again, due to [[asymmetric information]], policy makers and the general public see a government owned firm that was a financial 'disaster' - miraculously turned around by the private sector (and typically resold) within a few years.  . 

===Underdeveloped or highly corrupt economies===. 
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2011}}
In a society with substantial corruption, privatization allows the government currently in power and its backers to siphon a large portion of the entire [[net present value]] of state assets away from the public and into the accounts of their favored power brokers. Without privatization, corrupt officials would have to slowly harvest their corrupt earnings over time. As such, efficient privatization depends on their being a very low of '''current''' corruption among the current government officials since it allows for far more 'efficient' extraction of corrupt rents.  . 

Of course, corrupt governments can also extract corrupt rents quite efficiently in other ways - particularly by borrowing extensively to engage in spending on overly favorable contracts with their backers (or on [[tax shelters]], subsidies or other giveaways). Generations of subsequent taxpayers are then left with paying back the debt incurred for corrupt transfers made decades previously. Naturally, this may lead to the sale of public assets....  . 

In the end, the public is left with a government that taxes them heavily, and gives them nothing in return. Debt repayment is enforced by international agreements and agencies such as the IMF. 
Infrastructure and upkeep is sacrificed - leading to a further decay in the economic efficiency of the country over time.  . 

==Alternatives==. 
{{Original research|date=January 2010}} . 

===Public utility===. 
The enterprise can remain as a public utility.  . 

===Non-profit===. 
A private non-profit organization could manage the enterprise.  . 

===Municipalization===. 
Transferring control to [[Municipality|municipal government]] . 

===Outsourcing or sub-contracting===. 
National services may sub-contract or out-source functions to private enterprises. A notable example of this is in the [[United Kingdom]], where many [[municipalities]] have contracted out their garbage collection or administration of parking fines to private companies. In addition, the British government has involved the private sector more in the workings of the [[National Health Service]] principally through outsourcing the construction and operation of new hospitals to private companies. There are also moves to refer patients to private surgeries to ease the load on existing NHS human resources, and covering the cost of this.  . 

One career city manager in America, Roger L. Kemp, wrote a library reference volume titled ''Privatization: The Provision of Public Services by the Private Sector,'' which was originally published in 1991 and republished in 2007. In this volume, based on a national literature search of best practices among municipal governments in this field, Dr. Kemp recommended that administrators owe it to their taxpayers and citizens to seek private alternatives to selected public services. He felt that city managers should go to the marketplace to determine the cost of contracting for selected public services, while keeping quality consistent with the same service provided by the municipality. Sometimes, Kemp noted, it's more cost effective to have certain public services provided by contract by the private sector. In some cases it can be less expensive for the private sector to provide public services, but the benefit to society may actually turn out to be less as well.  . 

{{See also|private finance initiative}} . 

===Partial ownership===. 
An enterprise may be privatized, but with the state retaining a number of shares in the resultant company. This is a particularly notable phenomenon in [[France]], where the state often retains a "blocking stake" in private industries. In Germany, the state privatized [[Deutsche Telekom]] in small tranches, and still retains about a third of the company. As of 2005, the state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] is also planning to buy shares in the energy company [[E.ON]] in what is claimed to be an attempt to control spiraling costs.  . 

Whilst partial privatization could be an alternative, it is more often a stepping stone to full privatization. It can offer the business a smoother transition period during which it can gradually adjust to market competition. Some state-owned companies are so large that there is the risk of sucking liquidity from the rest of the market, even in the most liquid marketplaces: this may favor gradual privatization. The first ''tranche'' of a multi-step privatization would also in the first instance establish a valuation for the enterprise to mitigate complaints of under-pricing.  . 

In some instances of partial privatization of contracted services, some portion(s) of the state-owned service are provided by private-sector contractors, but the government retains the capacity to self-operate at contract intervals, if it so chooses. An example of partial privatization would be some forms of [[school bus contractor|school bus service contracting]], such as arrangements where equipment and other resources purchased with government capital funds and/o those already owned by a governmental entity are used by the contractor for a period of time in providing services, but ownership is retained by the governmental unit. This form of partial privatization eases concerns that once an operation is contracted, the government may be unable to obtain sufficient competitive bids, and be subjected to terms less desirable than the prior operation under state-ownership. Under that scenario, a ''reverse privatization'' would be more feasible for the government. (see section below) .

The largest privatization in history{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} involved [[Japan Post]]. It was the nation's largest employer and one third of all Japanese government employees worked for Japan Post. Japan Post was often said to be the largest holder of personal savings in the world.  . 

The Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] wanted to privatize it because it was thought{{By whom|date=April 2010}} to be an inefficient and a source for corruption. In September 2003, Koizumi's cabinet proposed splitting Japan Post into four separate companies: a bank, an insurance company, a postal service company, and a fourth company to handle the post offices as retail storefronts of the other three.  . 

After the Upper House rejected privatization, Koizumi scheduled [[Japan general election, 2005|nationwide elections]] for September 11, 2005. He declared the election to be a referendum on postal privatization. Koizumi subsequently won this election, gaining the necessary [[supermajority]] and a mandate for reform, and in October 2005, the bill was passed to privatize Japan Post in 2007. <ref>Takahara, "All eyes on Japan Post"{{cite news | first = Anthony | last = Faiola | title = Japan Approves Postal Privatization | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/14/AR2005101402163.html | work = Washington Post | publisher = The Washington Post Company | page = A10 | date = 2005-10-15 | accessdate = 2007-02-09}}</ref> . 

[[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone]]'s privatization in 1987 involved the largest share-offering in [[financial history]] at the time. <ref name="megginson205">The Financial Economics of Privatisation By William L. Megginson, p. 205 - 206</ref> 15 of the world's 20 largest public share offerings have been privatizations of telecoms. <ref name="megginson205"/> . 

The United Kingdom's largest public-share offerings were privatizations of [[British Telecom]] and [[British Gas plc|British Gas]] during the [[1980s]] under the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Margaret Thatcher]], when many state-run firms were sold off to the private sector. This attracted very mixed views from the public and parliament, and even a former Conservative prime minister, [[Harold Macmillan]], was critical of the policy; likening it to "selling the family silver". <ref>[http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/harold-macmillan-2/]</ref>There were around 3,000,000 shareholders in Britain when Thatcher [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|took office in 1979]], but the subsequent sale of state-run firms saw the level of shareholders double to 6,000,000 by 1985 and by the time of her resignation as prime minister in 1990 there were more than 10,000,000 shareholders in Britain. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/4446012.stm | work=BBC News | title=Thatcher years in graphics | date=2005-11-18}}</ref> . 

The largest public-share offering in France was [[France Telecom]].  . 

Egypt undertook widespread privatization under President [[Hosni Mubarak]]. After his overthrow in the [[2011 Egyptian revolution|2011 revolution]], the association of the newly private businesses with the [[crony capitalism]] of the old regime along with the new look at long-festering [[Employment|labor]] and [[police-state]] issues have led to calls for [[#Reversion|re-nationalization]]. <ref>Amos, Deborah, [http://www.npr.org/2011/04/20/135542498/in-egypt-revolution-moves-into-the-factories "In Egypt, Revolution Moves Into The Factories"], ''[[NPR]]'', April 20, 2011. Retrieved 2011-04-20. </ref> . 

==Negative responses==. 
Privatization proposals in key [[public services|public service]] sectors such as [[water]] and [[electricity]] in many cases meet with strong resistance from opposition political parties and from [[civil society]] groups, many of which regard them as [[natural monopoly|natural monopolies]]. Campaigns typically involve demonstrations and democratic political activities; sometimes the authorities attempt to suppress opposition using violence (e.g. [[Cochabamba protests of 2000]] in [[Bolivia]] and protests in [[Arequipa]], Peru, in June 2002). Opposition is often strongly supported by [[trade union]]s. Opposition is usually strongest to [[water privatization]]—as well as Cochabamba, recent examples include [[Haiti]], [[Ghana]] and [[Uruguay]] (2004). In the latter case a civil-society-initiated [[referendum]] banning water privatization was passed in October 2004.  . 

More recently, the Republican-led Florida Senate defeated a bill to privatize state prisons.  <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/15/us-usa-prisons-florida-idUSTRE81E06A20120215|newspaper=Reuters|date=February 14, 2012}} Retrieved 2012-04-28. </ref> . 

==Reversion==. 
A reversion from contracted ownership of an enterprise or services to governmental ownership and/or provision is called ''reverse privatization'' or [[nationalization]]. Such a situation most often occurs when a privatization contractor fails financially and/or the governmental unit has failed to purchase satisfactory service at prices it regards as less than with state-ownership or self-operation of services. Another circumstance may occur when greater control than viable under privatization is determined to be in the governmental unit's best interest.  . 

National-security concerns may be the source of reverse privatization actions when the most likely providers are non-domestic or international corporations or entities. For example, in 2001, in response to the September 11th attacks, the then-private airport security industry in the United States was nationalized{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} and put under the authority of the [[Transportation Security Administration]].  .
