In [[economics]], '''regulatory capture''' occurs when a [[State (polity)|state]] regulatory agency created to act in the public interest instead advances the commercial or special interests that dominate the industry or sector it is charged with regulating. Regulatory capture is a form of [[government failure]], as it can act as an encouragement for large firms to produce [[negative externality|negative externalities]]. The agencies are called "captured agencies".  . 

== The theory ==. 
For [[public choice theory|public choice theorists]], regulatory capture occurs because groups or individuals with a high-stakes interest in the outcome of policy or regulatory decisions can be expected to focus their resources and energies in attempting to gain the policy outcomes they prefer, while members of the public, each with only a tiny individual stake in the outcome, will ignore it altogether. <ref name="nyt-tbl">Timothy B. Lee, [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/03/opinion/03lee.html "Entangling the Web"] ''The New York Times'' (August 3, 2006). Retrieved April 1, 2011</ref> Regulatory capture refers to when this imbalance of focused resources devoted to a particular policy outcome is successful at "capturing" influence with the staff or commission members of the regulatory agency, so that the preferred policy outcomes of the special interest are implemented. For an example of this, see a statement by [[US Attorney General]] [[Richard Olney]] in the [[Regulatory_capture#Interstate_Commerce_Commission_.28ICC.29|ICC section]] below.  . 

Regulatory capture theory is a core focus of the branch of public choice referred to as the [[Regulatory economics|economics of regulation]]; economists in this specialty are critical of conceptualizations of governmental regulatory intervention as being motivated to protect [[public good]]. Often cited articles include Bernstein (1955), Huntington (1952), Laffont & Tirole (1991), and Levine & Forrence (1990). The theory of regulatory capture is associated with [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureate economist [[George Stigler]], one of its main developers. <ref>Edmund Amann (Ed.), [http://books.google.com/books?id=akSneB10pJ0C&pg=PA14#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Regulating Development: Evidence from Africa and Latin America''] Google Books. Edward Elgar Publishing (2006), p.&nbsp;14. ISBN 978-1-84542-499-2. Retrieved April 14, 2011</ref> . 

Likelihood of regulatory capture is a risk to which an agency is exposed by its very nature. <ref>Gary Adams, Sharon Hayes, Stuart Weierter and John Boyd, [http://www.iceaustralia.com/apsacc2011/pdf/papers07/day1_24oct07/StreamA2/RegulatoryCaptureManagingTheRisks_JohnBoyd.pdf "Regulatory Capture: Managing the Risk"] ICE Australia, International Conferences and Events (PDF) (October 24, 2007). Retrieved April 14, 2011</ref> This suggests that a regulatory agency should be protected from outside influence as much as possible. Alternatively, it may be better to not create a given agency at all lest the agency become victim, in which case it may serve its regulated subjects rather than those whom the agency was designed to protect. A captured regulatory agency is often worse than no regulation, because it wields the authority of government.  . 

=== Economic rationale ===. 
The idea of regulatory capture has an obvious economic basis in that vested interests in an industry have the greatest financial stake in regulatory activity and are more likely to be motivated to influence the regulatory body than dispersed individual consumers,<ref name="nyt-tbl" /> each of whom has little particular incentive to try to influence regulators. When regulators form expert bodies to examine policy, this invariably features current or former industry members, or at the very least, individuals with contacts in the industry.  . 

Some economists, such as [[Jon Hanson]] and his co-authors, argue that the phenomenon extends beyond just political agencies and organizations. Businesses have an incentive to control anything that has power over them, including institutions from the media to academia to popular culture, and thus will try to capture them as well. They call this phenomenon "deep capture."<ref>Jon D. Hanson and David G.

=== Federal Reserve Bank of New York (New York Fed) ===. 
The [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] is the most influential of the Federal Reserve Banking System.

In the wake of the financial meltdown, Geithner became the "bailout king" of a recovery plan that benefited Wall Street banks at the expense of U.S. taxpayers. <ref name="nyt-geithner" /> Geithner engineered the New York Fed's purchase of $30 billion of [[credit default swap]]s from [[American International Group]] (AIG), which it had sold to [[Goldman Sachs]], [[Merrill Lynch]], [[Deutsche Bank]] and [[Société Générale]].

=== Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) ===. 
Historians, political scientists, and economists have used the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]], a now-defunct federal regulatory body in the United States, as a classic example of regulatory capture. The creation of the ICC was the result of widespread and longstanding anti-railroad agitation. [[Richard Olney]] joined the [[Grover Cleveland]] administration as [[attorney general]] not long after the ICC was established. Olney, formerly a prominent railroad lawyer, was asked if he could do something to get rid of the ICC. <ref name="wsj-frank">Thomas Frank, [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124580461065744913.html "Obama and 'Regulatory Capture'"] ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' (June 24, 2010).

The ICC, critics claimed, set rates at artificially high levels and excluded new competitors through a restrictive permitting process. <ref>[[Free to Choose]], Milton Friedman</ref> . 

=== Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) ===. 
According to [[Frank N. von Hippel]], despite the 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]] in Pennsylvania, the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] has often been too timid in ensuring that America’s 104 commercial reactors are operated safely:
<blockquote>
Nuclear power is a textbook example of the problem of “regulatory capture” — in which an industry gains control of an agency meant to regulate it. Regulatory capture can be countered only by vigorous public scrutiny and Congressional oversight, but in the 32 years since Three Mile Island, interest in nuclear regulation has declined precipitously. <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/opinion/24Von-Hippel.html?_r=2&scp=1&sq=frank%20von%20hippel&st=cse |title=It Could Happen Here |author=Frank Von Hippel |date= March 23, 2011|work=New York Times }}</ref>

Some former ministry officials have been offered lucrative jobs in a practice called ''[[amakudari]]'', "descent from heaven". <ref name="nyt-januke" /><ref name="nyt-nomf" /> A panel responsible for re-writing Japan's nuclear safety rules was dominated by experts and advisers from utility companies,<ref name="nyt-nomf" /> said seismology professor [[Katsuhiko Ishibashi]] who quit the panel in protest, saying it was rigged and "unscientific". <ref name="bloom-japan" /> The new guidelines, established in 2006, did not set stringent industry-wide [[earthquake]] standards, rather nuclear plant operators were left to do their own inspections to ensure their plants were compliant. <ref name="nyt-nomf" /> In 2008, the NISA found all of Japan's reactors to be in compliance with the new earthquake guidelines. <ref name="nyt-nomf" /> . 

[[Yoshihiro Kinugasa]] helped write Japan's nuclear safety rules, later conducted inspections and still in another position at another date, served on a licensing panel, signing off on inspections. <ref name="bloom-japan" /> . 

=== Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) ===. 
In 1996, the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health and Welfare]] (now combined with the Ministry of Labour) came under fire over the [[HIV-tainted blood scandal (Japan)|scandal of HIV-tainted blood]] being used to treat [[hemophiliac]]s. <ref name="jpri">Masao Miyamoto, [http://www.jpri.org/publications/workingpapers/wp23.html "Mental Castration, the HIV Scandal, and the Japanese Bureaucracy"] Japan Policy Research Institute (August 1996). Retrieved April 1, 2011</ref> Although warned about HIV contamination of blood products imported from the U.S., the ministry abruptly changed its position on heated and unheated blood products from the U.S., protecting [[Green Cross (Japan)|Green Cross]] and the Japanese [[pharmaceutical industry]] by keeping the Japanese market from being inundated with heat-treated blood from the United States. <ref name="jpri" /> Because the unheated blood was not taken off the market, 400 people died and over 3,000 people were infected with HIV. <ref name="jpri" /> No senior officials were indicted and only one lower-level manager was indicted and convicted. <ref name="jatimes">Tomoko Otake, [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20091101x4.html "Ministry insider speaks out"] ''Japan Times'' (November 1, 2009). Retrieved April 1, 2011</ref> Critics say the major task of the ministry is the protection of industry, rather than of the population. <ref name="jpri" /> In addition, bureaucrats get ''amakudari'' jobs at related industries in their field upon retirement, a system which serves to inhibit regulators. <ref name="jpri" /> Moriyo Kimura, a critic who works at MHLW, says the ministry does not look after the interests of the public. <ref name="jatimes" /> . 

==Quotes==. 
In 1913 [[Woodrow Wilson]] wrote, "If the government is to tell big business men how to run their business, then don't you see that big business men have to get closer to the government even than they are now? Don't you see that they must capture the government, in order not to be restrained too much by it? Must capture the government? They have already captured it."<ref>Woodrow Wilson, [[s:The New Freedom: A Call for the Emancipation of the Generous Energies of a People|The New Freedom: A Call For the Emancipation of the Generous Energies of a People]]</ref> . 

At a January 2010 hearing of the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]], U.S. Representative [[Marcy Kaptur]] told former president of the New York Fed and current [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]], [[Timothy Geithner]], “A lot of people think that the president of the New York Fed works for the U.S. government. But in fact you work for the private banks that elected you.”<ref name="bberg-reilly" /> . 

In a May 2011 article entitled, "Why CEOs Avoided Getting Busted in Meltdown", former [[Savings and Loan]] regulator [[William K. Black]] wrote, "The defining characteristic of [[crony capitalism]] is the ability of favored elites to loot with impunity and the failure of regulators to do their jobs."<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-05-10/why-ceos-avoided-getting-busted-in-meltdown-william-k-black.html "Why CEOs Avoided Getting Busted in Meltdown"] ''Businessweek'' (May 10, 2011).

In a June 2011 article by the Associated Press, nuclear engineer Paul Blanch said, "It's a philosophical position that [NRC regulators] take that's driven by the industry and by the economics: What do we need to do to let those plants continue to operate? They somehow sharpen their pencil to either modify their interpretation of the regulations, or they modify their assumptions in the risk assessment."<ref name="ap-jdonn" /> .
