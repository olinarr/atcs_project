Capitalism has been the subject of criticism from many perspectives during its history. Criticisms range from people who disagree with the principles of [[capitalism]] in its entirety, to those who disagree with particular outcomes of capitalism. Among those wishing to replace capitalism with a different method of production and social organization, a distinction can be made between those believing that capitalism can only be overcome with [[revolution]] (e.g., [[revolutionary socialism]]) and those believing that structural change can come slowly through [[reformism|political reforms]] to capitalism (e.g., [[social democracy|classic social democracy]]). Some critics recognize merits in capitalism and wish to balance capitalism with some form of social control, typically through government regulation (e.g., [[social market]] movement and [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]]).{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} . 

==History==. 
According to contemporary critics{{Quantify|date=April 2010}} of capitalism, [[industrial revolution|rapid industrialization]] in Europe created working conditions viewed as unfair, including: [[8 hour day|14-hour work days]], [[child labor]], and [[shanty towns]]. <ref name ="conditionsworking">{{cite web | last = Engels | first = Frederick | title = The Condition of the Working Class in England | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/index.htm | accessdate = 2008-04-16}}</ref> Some modern economists argue that average living standards did not improve, or only very slowly improved, before 1840. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/IndustrialRevolutionandtheStandardofLiving.html|title=Industrial Revolution and the Standard of Living|author=Clark Nardinelli, economist at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration|work=The concise encyclopedia of economics|publisher=The Library of Economics and Liberty|accessdate=2008-04-20}}</ref> . 

Early [[Socialism|socialist]] thinkers rejected capitalism altogether, attempting to create socialist communities free of the perceived injustices of early capitalism. Among these [[utopian socialism|utopian socialists]] were [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Robert Owen]]. In 1848, [[Karl Marx]] and [[Frederick Engels]] released the ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'', which outlined a political and economic critique of capitalism based on the philosophy of [[historical materialism]]. [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] a contemporary of Marx was another notable critic of capitalism, and was one of the first to call himself an [[Anarchism|anarchist]]. 
[[File:Pyramid of Capitalist System.png|thumb|right|275px|[[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]] poster "Pyramid of the Capitalist System"(c. 1911), depicting an [[anarchist]] perspective on statist/capitalist social structures]] . 

By the early 20th century,  myriad socialist tendencies (e.g., [[anarcho-syndicalism]], social democracy and [[Bolshevism]]) had arisen based on different interpretations of current events. Governments also began placing restrictions on market operations and created [[Economic interventionism|interventionist programs]], attempting to ameliorate perceived market shortcomings (e.g., [[Keynesian economics]] and the [[New Deal]]). Starting with the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|1917 Russian revolution]], [[Communist state]]s increased in numbers, and a [[Cold War]] started with the developed capitalist nations. Following the [[Revolutions of 1989]], many of these Communist states adopted [[market economy|market economies]]. The notable exceptions to this trend have been North Korea, Cuba, and Venezuela, the latter instituting a philosophy referred to as "[[Socialism of the 21st century]]".  .

===Democracy and economic freedom===.

{{Refimprove section|date=November 2010}} . 

Capitalist systems have often functioned under unelected governments: the classic case is the United Kingdom, where less than 20% of adult males could vote prior to 1885, and women did not receive the vote until 1918. <ref>http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/diary/historylesson.htm</ref> . 

Marxist economist [[Branko Horvat]] stated: "... it is now well known that capitalist development leads to the concentration of capital, employment and power. It is somewhat less known that it leads to the almost complete destruction of economic freedom."<ref>Horvat, Branko, The Political Economy of Socialism (Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, Inc.) p.11</ref> . 

===Exploitation===. 
{{See also|Wage slavery}}
[[Image:UsuryDurer.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Of Usury, from [[Sebastian Brant|Brant's]] ''Stultifera Navis'' ([[Narrenschiff|the Ship of Fools]]); [[woodcut]] attributed to [[Albrecht Dürer]]]]
Critics of capitalism view the system as inherently [[exploitative]]. In an economic sense, exploitation is often related to the [[expropriation]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}} of labor for [[profit (economics)|profit]] and based on Marx's version of the [[labor theory of value]]. The labor theory of value was supported by classical economists like [[David Ricardo]] and [[Adam Smith]] who believed that "the value of a commodity depends on the relative quantity of labor which is necessary for its production."<ref name ="principlesvalue">{{cite web | last = Ricardo | first = David | title = Chapter 1: On Value -- On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation | url = http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/ricardo/tax/ch01.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-10}}</ref> . 

In ''[[Das Kapital]]'', Karl Marx identified the commodity as the basic unit of capitalist organization. Marx described a "common denominator" between commodities, in particular that commodities are the product of labor and are related to each other by an [[exchange value]] (i.e., [[price]]). <ref name="commodities">{{Cite book | last = Marx | first = Karl | title = Chapter 1: Commodities -- Capital, Volume 1 | publisher = Penguin Classics | year = 1992 | url = http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#S1 | isbn = 0140445684}}</ref> By using the labor theory of value, [[Marxists]] see a connection between labor and exchange value, in that commodities are exchanged depending on the [[socially necessary labor time]] needed to produce them. <ref name ="valueprice">{{cite web | last = Marx | first = Karl | title = Value, Price, and Profit | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1865/value-price-profit/ | accessdate = 2008-03-10}}</ref> However, due to the productive forces of industrial organization, laborers are seen as creating more exchange value during the course of the working day than the cost of their survival (food, shelter, clothing, etc.). <ref name ="wagelabour">{{cite web | last = Marx | first = Karl | title = Wage Labour and Capital | url = http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/wage-labour/ch06.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-10}}</ref> Marxists argue that capitalists are thus able to pay for this cost of survival, while expropriating the excess labor (i.e., [[surplus value]]). <ref name=valueprice/> . 

[[Marxism|Marxists]] further argue that due to [[economic inequality]], the purchase of labor cannot occur under "free" conditions. Since capitalists control the [[means of production]] (e.g., factories, businesses, machinery) and workers control only their labor, the worker is naturally coerced into allowing their labor to be exploited. <ref name ="competition">{{cite web | last = Engels | first = Frederick | title = Competition -- The Condition of the Working Class in England | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/ch05.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-10}}</ref> Critics argue that exploitation occurs even if the exploited consents, since the definition of exploitation is independent of consent. In essence, workers must allow their labor to be exploited or face starvation. Since some degree of [[unemployment]] is typical in modern economies, Marxists argue that wages are naturally driven down in free market systems. Hence, even if a worker contests their wages, capitalists are able to find someone from the [[reserve army of labor]] who is more desperate. <ref name ="histmaterial">{{cite web | last = Engels | first = Frederick | title = Historical Materialism -- Socialism: Utopian and Scientific | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch03.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-10}}</ref> . 

Unions are the "traditional method" for workers to have more [[inequality of bargaining power|bargaining power]] in the marketplace.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The act (or threat) of [[strike action|striking]] has historically been an organized action to withhold labor from capitalists, without fear of individual retaliation. <ref name ="tradesoc">{{cite web | last = Kautsky | first = Karl | title = Trade Unions and Socialism | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1901/04/unions.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-10}}</ref> Some critics of capitalism, while acknowledging the necessity of trade unionism, believe that trade unions simply reform an already exploitative system, leaving the system of exploitation intact. <ref name="subterranean">{{Cite book | last = Smith | first = Sharon | title = Subterranean Fire: A History of Working Class Radicalism in the United States | publisher = [[Haymarket Books]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 193185923X | pages = 320}}</ref><ref name="reformrevolution">{{cite web | last = Luxembourg| first = Rosa | title = Chapter VII: Co-operatives, Unions, Democracy -- Reform or Revolution | url = http://marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1900/reform-revolution/ch07.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-10}}</ref> [[Lysander Spooner]] argued that "almost all fortunes are made out of the capital and labour of other men than those who realize them. Indeed, large fortunes could rarely be made at all by one individual, except by his sponging capital and labour from others."<ref>[[James J. Martin|Martin, James J.]] ''Men Against the State'', p. 173</ref> . 

[[Labor history (discipline)|Labor historian]] [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] has argued that [[Unfree labour|unfree labor]]—by [[Slavery|slaves]], [[indentured servant]]s, prisoners, and other coerced persons—is compatible with capitalist relations. <ref>That unfree labor is acceptable to capital was argued during the 1980s by Tom Brass. See ''Towards a Comparative Political Economy of Unfree Labor'' (Cass, 1999). {{cite web |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/llt/52/linden.html |title="Labour History as the History of Multitudes", ''Labour/Le Travail'', 52, Fall 2003, pp. 235-244 |author=Marcel van der Linden |accessdate=2008-02-26}}</ref> . 

Modern skeptics of free market capitalism observe that while in major capitalist economies the [[minimum wage]] is legislatively imposed by the state, there is no [[maximum wage]] limit, which is supposedly determined by the forces of the free market. They further argue that the minimum wage measure does not serve to set a lower limit in a worker's earnings; it actually functions as an upper limit on the earnings of a person that just enters the workforce. The existence of minimum wage, coupled with the absence of maximum, permits rapid [[Distribution of wealth|wealth accumulation]] and leads to a phenomenon termed "[[plutocracy|plutonomy]]" by [[Citigroup]]. <ref>http://www.scribd.com/doc/6674234/Citigroup-Oct-16-2005-Plutonomy-Report-Part-1</ref> In effect, wages are kept low for almost all of the population while the remaining minute percentage is allowed to meet overwhelming profits.  . 

Academics such as [[Howard Gardner]] have proposed the adoption of upper limits in individual wealth as "a solution that would make the world a better place". <ref>http://www.alternet.org/economy/62507/</ref> . 

===Imperialism and political oppression===. 
Critics<ref>[http://www.monthlyreview.org/100601mcchesney-foster.php Capitalism, The Absurd System ''A View From the United States'' ] Robert W. McChesney and John Bellamy Foster [[Monthly Review]] June 2010</ref> argue that the ills caused by capitalism include [[imperialism]] and [[oppression]]. They point systematic violence against political opponents, participation in coups that have placed dictators in power (for example [[Augusto Pinochet]] [[Chile under Pinochet|in Chile]], Argentina with its "[[Dirty War]]"); and large scale [[democide]] (like in the [[Congo Free State]]).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Although some of these violations occurred during a time period and in states sometimes considered being more capitalist than today since the government share of the economy was much smaller, U.S and European support of multinational-friendly capitalist dictatorships in Latin America and Africa lasted until the mid 1980s.  . 

Near the start of the 20th century, Vladimir Lenin claimed that state use of military power to defend capitalist interests abroad was an inevitable corollary of monopoly capitalism. <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/index.htm | title=Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism | author=Vladimir Lenin | accessdate=June 29, 2006}}</ref> Critics of capitalism allege the system is responsible for not only economic exploitation, but imperialist, [[colonialist]] and [[counter-revolutionary]] wars, repressions of workers and trade unionists, [[genocide]]s and [[wikt:massacre|massacres]].  . 

Marxists, importantly [[Vladimir Lenin]], argue that capitalism needs imperialism in order to survive. <ref>Lenin’s Selected Works, Progress Publishers, 1963, Moscow, Volume 1, pp. 667–766</ref> The unplanned nature of capitalism, they say, inevitably overproduces commodities and overuses resources, which leads it to expand its markets into and drain the resources out of other, less-developed nations. The wealthy nations, they say, must maintain cheap access to third world natural resources and unfree labor, by force if necessary. They argue that the capitalist countries like England initially were helped by the [[primitive accumulation]] of capital through the "theft" of natural resources and exploitation of slave labor from large parts of Asia, Africa and the Americas, which spurred the industrial revolution. They see what they characterize as unjust exploitation, militarily (such as India in 19th century) or economically (e.g., through [[International Monetary Fund]] [[structural adjustment]] programs during the 1980s), as part of the nature of capitalism. The constant, capitalist drive to expand markets is viewed by many as the primary cause of [[globalization]]. <ref>De la Torre, A. Emerging capital markets and globalization. Retrieved from http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/11/03/000310607_20061103105655/Rendered/PDF/378920Emerging0capital0markets01PUBLIC1.pdf</ref> . 

In his essay, ''Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism'', Vladimir Lenin advanced the now widespread thesis that the ‘[[New Imperialism]]’ of the late 19th and early 20th centuries was an inevitable corollary of monopoly capitalism. <ref>http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/index.htm</ref> According to Lenin, the export of financial capital superseded the export of commodities; banking and industrial capital merged to form large financial cartels and trusts in which production distribution are highly centralized; and monopoly capitalists influenced state policy to carve up the world into spheres of interest (Burnham). These trends led states to defend their capitalist interests abroad through military power.  . 

===Inefficiency and waste===. 
Some opponents criticize capitalism's perceived [[inefficiency]]. They note a shift from pre-industrial [[reuse]] and thriftiness before capitalism to a consumer-based economy that pushes "ready-made" materials. <ref name="isrwaste">{{cite web | last = Rogers | first = Heather | title = The Conquest of Garbage | url = http://www.isreview.org/issues/53/garbage.shtml | publisher = [[International Socialist Review]] | accessdate = 2008-03-13}}</ref> It is argued that a [[sanitation]] industry arose under capitalism that deemed trash valueless; a significant break from the past when much "waste" was used and reused almost indefinitely. <ref name=isrwaste/> In the process, critics say, capitalism has created a profit driven system based on selling as many products as possible. <ref name="natural">{{cite web | last = Hawken | first = Paul | title = Natural Capitalism | url = http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/1997/03/hawken.html | accessdate = 2008-03-13}}</ref> Critics relate the "ready-made" trend to a growing garbage problem in which the average American throws out 4.5 pounds of trash per day (compared to 2.7 pounds in 1960). <ref name="epawaste">{{cite web | last = U.S. EPA | title = Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Pie Chart | url = http://www.epa.gov/msw/facts-text.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-13}}</ref> Anti-capitalist groups with an emphasis on conservation include [[eco-socialists]] and [[social ecology|social ecologists]].  . 

[[Planned obsolescence]] has also been criticized as a wasteful practice under capitalism. By designing products to wear out faster than need be, new consumption is generated. <ref name=isrwaste/> This would benefit corporations by increasing sales, while at the same time generating excessive waste. A well-known example is the charge that Apple designed its [[iPod]] to fail after 18 months. <ref name="ipod">{{cite news | last = Inman | first = Phillip | title = When your iPod isn't all that it's cracked up to be | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2006/sep/30/news.consumernews | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 2008-03-13 | location=London | date=2006-09-30}}</ref> Critics view planned obsolescence as wasteful and an inefficient use of resources. <ref name="obsolescence">{{cite web | last = McMinn | first = David | title = Planned Obsolescence: The Ultimate Economic Inefficiency | url = http://www.davidmcminn.com/ngc/pages/obsol.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-13}}</ref> Other authors such as [[Naomi Klein]] have criticized brand-based marketing for putting more emphasis on the company's name-brand than on manufacturing products. <ref name="kleininter">{{cite web | last = PBS Frontline | title = Interview with Naomi Klein | url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/persuaders/interviews/klein.html | accessdate = 2008-03-13}}</ref> .

Critics have argued that there is an inherent tendency toward oligolopolistic structures when laissez-faire is combined with capitalist private property. Capitalism is regarded by many socialists to be irrational in that production and the direction of the economy are unplanned, creating many inconsistencies and internal contradictions and thus should be controlled through [[competition law|public policy]]. <ref>Brander, James A. Government policy toward business. 4th ed. Mississauga, Ontario: John Wiley & Sons Canada, Ltd., 2006. Print. </ref> . 

In the early 20th century, [[Vladimir Lenin]] argued that state use of military power to defend capitalist interests abroad was an inevitable corollary of monopoly capitalism. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/index.htm |title=Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism |author=Vladimir Lenin |accessdate=2008-02-26}}</ref> . 

[[Che Guevara]] wrote:<blockquote>
The laws of capitalism, which are blind and are invisible to ordinary people, act upon the individual without he or she being aware of it. One sees only the vastness of a seemingly infinite horizon ahead. That is how it is painted by capitalist propagandists who purport to draw a lesson from the example of [[John D. Rockefeller|Rockefeller]] — whether or not it is true — about the possibilities of individual success. The amount of poverty and suffering required for a [[Rockefeller family|Rockefeller]] to emerge, and the amount of depravity entailed in the accumulation of a fortune of such magnitude, are left out of the picture, and it is not always possible for the popular forces to expose this clearly.... It is a contest among wolves. One can win only at the cost of the failure of others. <ref name="Socialism and Man in Cuba">[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1965/03/man-socialism.htm "Socialism and Man in Cuba"] A letter to Carlos Quijano, editor of ''Marcha'', a weekly published in Montevideo, Uruguay; published as "From Algiers, for Marcha: The Cuban Revolution Today" by on March 12, 1965</ref>

A modern critic of capitalism is [[Ravi Batra]], who focuses on inequality as a source of immiserization but also of system failure. Batra popularised the concept "share of wealth held by richest 1%" as an indicator of inequality and an important determinant of depressions, in his best-selling books in the 1980s. <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/06/books/best-sellers-from-1987-s-book-crop.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |title=Best Sellers From 1987's Book Crop |accessdate=13 October 2011 |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/358815 |title=Regular economic cycles : money, inflation, regulation and depressions, Venus Books, 1985 |author=Ravi Batra|accessdate=13 October 2011}}</ref> His approach is based on the ideas of Indian philosopher [[P.R. Sarkar]], founder of the [[Ananda Marga]] movement, who developed the [[Law of Social Cycle]] to identify the [[Economic collapse|problems of capitalism]] and proposed the [[Progressive Utilization Theory]] (PROUT). <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prout.org/aftercapitalism/ |title=After Capitalism |author=Dada Maheshvarananda |accessdate=2008-02-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.proutworld.org/|title=proutworld|accessdate=2008-02-26|publisher=ProutWorld}}</ref> . 

In the United States, the shares of earnings and wealth of the households in the top 1 percent of the corresponding distributions are 21 percent (in 2006) and 37 percent (in 2009), respectively. <ref>http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp_589.pdf</ref> Critics, such as Ravi Batra, argue that the capitalist system has inherent biases favoring those who already possess greater resources. The inequality may be propagated through inheritance and economic policy. Rich people are in a position to give their children a better education and inherited wealth, and that this can create or increase large differences in wealth between people who do not differ in ability or effort. One study shows that in the U.S., 43.35% of the people in the ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine "400 richest individuals" list were already rich enough at birth to qualify. <ref>http://www.faireconomy.org/press/archive/Pre_1999/forbes_400_study.html</ref> Another study indicated that in the US, wealth, race, and schooling are important to the inheritance of economic status, but that IQ is not a major contributor, and the genetic transmission of IQ is even less important. <ref>http://www.umass.edu/preferen/gintis/intergen.pdf</ref> Batra has argued that the tax and benefit legislation in the USA since the [[Reagan Presidency]] has contributed greatly to the inequalities and economic problems and should be repealed. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.truth-out.org/occupy-wall-street-movement-and-coming-demise-crony-capitalism/1318341474|title="The Occupy Wall Street Movement and the Coming Demise of Crony Capitalism", ''Foreign Affairs'', October 11, 2011 |author=Ravi Batra|accessdate=13 October 2011}}</ref> . 

===Market failure===. 
[[Market failure]] is a term used by economists to describe the condition where the allocation of goods and services by a market is not [[Efficiency (economics)|efficient]]. Keynesian economist<ref>http://www.pkarchive.org/personal/EnronFAQ.html</ref> Paul Krugman views this scenario in which individuals' pursuit of self-interest leads to bad results for society as a whole. <ref name="krugman">Krugman, Paul, Wells, Robin, ''Economics'', Worth Publishers, New York, (2006)</ref> From this, some critics of capitalism prefer economic intervention by government into free markets. <ref name="keynes">{{Cite book | last = Keynes | first = John Maynard | title = The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money | publisher = [[Palgrave Macmillan]] | year = 2007 | isbn = 0230004768}}</ref> Some believe that the lack of [[perfect information]] and [[perfect competition]] in a free market is grounds for government intervention. Others perceive certain unique problems with a free market including: monopolies, [[monopsony|monopsonies]], [[insider trading]], and [[price gouging]]. {{Weasel-inline|date=May 2009}}<ref name ="part6">{{cite web | last = Rea | first = K.J. | title = Monopoly, Imperfect Competition, and Oligopoly | url = http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~reak/eco100/100_6.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-11}}</ref> . 

Legislation has been introduced to deal with these concerns (e.g., [[anti-trust legislation]] or [[financial regulation]]). Also, governments overseeing capitalist economies have been known to set mandatory [[price floor]]s or [[price ceiling]]s at times, thereby interfering with the free market mechanism. This usually occurs in times of crisis, or relating to goods and services viewed as strategically important. Electricity, for example, is a good that has typically been subject to price ceilings in many countries. <ref name ="dereg">{{cite news | last = Krugman | first = Paul | title = Reckonings, Watt Price Ideology? | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEFDF173FF930A35755C0A9679C8B63&scp=1&sq=electricity+price+ceiling&st=nyt | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = 2008-03-11 | date=2001-06-03}}</ref> . 

Wages determined by a free market mechanism are also commonly seen as a problem by those{{Who|date=April 2010}} who argue that some wages are unjustifiably low or unjustifiably high. Another perceived failure is that free markets usually fail to deal with the problem of [[externality|externalities]], where an action by an outside agent positively or negatively affects another agent without any compensation.{{Weasel-inline|date=May 2009}}<ref name ="externality">{{cite web | last = Johnson | first = Paul | title = Externality: A Glossary of Political Economy Terms | url = http://www.auburn.edu/~johnspm/gloss/externality | publisher = [[Auburn University]] | accessdate = 2008-03-11}}</ref> An example of an externality is [[pollution]]. More generally, free market allocation of resources in areas such as [[health care]], unemployment, [[income inequality|wealth inequality]], and education are considered market failures by some. <ref name ="nader">{{cite web | title = www.nader.org | url = http://www.nader.org/ | accessdate = 2008-03-11}}</ref> . 

Poor distribution of goods has also been identified as a market failure. One critic noted that 200 million Indians went hungry in 1995, while the Indian economy was exporting $625 million worth of wheat and $1.3 billion worth of rice that same year. <ref name ="themyth">{{cite web | last = Moore Lappe | first = Frances | title = The Myth - Scarcity: The Reality - There IS Enough Food | url = http://www.foodfirst.org/node/239 | accessdate = 2008-03-11}}</ref> . 

===Market instability===. 
Critics of capitalism, particularly Marxists, identify market instability as a permanent feature of capitalist economy. <ref name ="onfreetrade">{{cite web | last = Engels | first = Frederick | title = On the Question of Free Trade | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1888/free-trade/index.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-11}}</ref><ref name ="isrcrisis">{{cite web | last = Easterling | first = Earl | title = Marx's Theory of Economic Crisis | url = http://www.isreview.org/issues/32/crisis_theory.shtml | publisher = [[International Socialist Review]] | accessdate = 2008-03-13}}</ref> Marx believed that the unplanned and explosive growth of capitalism does not occur in a smooth manner, but is interrupted by periods of overproduction in which stagnation or decline occur (i.e., [[recessions]]). <ref name ="communistmanifesto">{{cite web | last = Marx | first = Karl | title = The Communist Manifesto | url = http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/index.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-11}}</ref> In the view of Marxists, several contradictions in the capitalist [[mode of production]] are present, particularly the internal contradiction between anarchy in the sphere of capital (i.e., [[free market]]) and socialised production in the sphere of labor (i.e., [[industrialism]]). <ref name ="anti-duhring">{{cite web | last = Engels | first = Frederick | title = Part III: Socialism (Theoretical) -- Anti-Duhring | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/ch24.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-11}}</ref> Due to the unplanned nature of the system, capitalists produce without knowing in advance what they can sell, while at the same time unleashing huge productive capabilities through industrial organization. The result is that crises are not caused by shortages, like a crop failure, but rather from a production of too many goods. Marx and Engels, in the ''Communist Manifesto'', highlighted what they saw as a uniquely capitalist juxtaposition of overabundance and poverty: "Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism. And why? Because there is too much civilization, too much means of subsistence, too much industry, too much commerce."<ref name=communistmanifesto/> . 

===Property===. 
Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Friedrich Engels argue that the free market is not necessarily free, but weighted towards those who already own property. <ref name=histmaterial/><ref name ="propertytheft">{{cite web | last = Proudhon | first = Pierre-Joseph | title = What Is Property? An Inquiry Into the Principle of Right and Government | url = http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/property/index.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-10}}</ref> They view capitalist regulations, including the enforcement of private property on land and exclusive rights to natural resources, as unjustly enclosing upon what should be owned by all, forcing those without property to sell their labor to capitalists and landlords in a market favorable to the latter, thus forcing workers to accept low wages in order to survive. <ref name="meaningmarx">{{Cite book | last = D'Amato | first = Paul | title = The Meaning of Marxism | publisher = [[Haymarket Books]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 1931859299 | pages = 60}}</ref> In his criticism of capitalism, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon believed that the emphasis on property is the problem. He argued that [[property is theft]], arguing that property leads to despotism: "Now, property necessarily engenders despotism—the government of caprice, the reign of libidinous pleasure. That is so clearly the essence of property that, to be convinced of it, one need but remember what it is, and observe what happens around him. Property is the right to use and abuse."<ref name=propertytheft/> Many left-wing anarchists, such as [[anarchist communist]]s, believe in replacing capitalist private property with a system where people can lay claim to things based on personal use and claim that "Property is the domination of an individual, or a coalition of individuals, over things; it is not the claim of any person or persons to the use of things" and "this is, usufruct, a very different matter. Property means the monopoly of wealth, the right to prevent others using it, whether the owner needs it or not."<ref>Anarchist Essays, pp. 22-23 and p. 40 Freedom Press, London, 2000. </ref> . 

[[Mutualism (economic theory)|Mutualists]] and some anarchists support markets and private property, but not in their present form. <ref name="mutualiststudy">{{Cite book | last = Carson | first = Kevin | title = Studies in Mutualist Political Economy | publisher = BookSurge Publishing | year = 2007 | isbn = 1419658697}}</ref> They argue that particular aspects of modern capitalism violate the ability of individuals to trade in the absence of coercion. Mutualists support markets and private property in the product of labor, but only when these markets guarantee that workers [[worker cooperative|will realize for themselves]] the value of their labor. <ref name=propertytheft/> . 

In recent times, most economies have extended property rights to include such things as [[patents]] and [[copyrights]]. Critics see this as coercive against those with few prior resources. They argue that such regulations discourage the sharing of ideas, and encourage nonproductive [[rent seeking]] behavior, both of which enact a [[deadweight loss]] on the economy, erecting a prohibitive barrier to entry into the market. <ref name ="copyright">{{cite web | last1 = Posner | first2 = Richard | title = An Economic Analysis of Property Law | url = http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/IPCoop/89land1.html | accessdate = 2008-03-10}}</ref> Not all pro-capitalists support the concept of copyrights, but those who do argue that compensation to the creator is necessary as an incentive. <ref name=copyright/> . 

===Sustainability===. 
An economic system that produces strong economic growth and requires essentially free trade<ref>Carroll, Conn [http://blog.heritage.org/?p=91 "Free Trade Essential for Economic Growth"], "American Heritage Institute", January 29th, 2008, accessed 12/21/2010</ref> may have a large effect on the environment. <ref>Wall, Derek. Address to ''Global Future of Globalised Disaster?'' http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TD4r6Q3KL3Y&feature=related</ref> . 

One of the main modern criticisms to the sustainability of capitalism is related to the so called commodity chains, or production/consumption chains. <ref>http://www.it-environment.org/publications/QITS%20report.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.unpop.nl/inhoud/artikelen/Francken%20CRR%20sept%202006%20dublin.ppt</ref> These terms refer to the network of transfers of materials and commodities that is currently part of the functioning of the global capitalist system. Examples include high tech commodities produced in countries with low average wages by multinational firms, and then being sold in distant high income countries; materials and resources being extracted in some countries, turned into finished products in some others and sold as commodities in further ones; countries exchanging with each other the same kind of commodities for the sake of consumer's choice (e.g., Europe both exporting and importing cars to and from the U.S.). According to critics such processes, all of which produce pollution and waste of resources, are an integral part of the functioning of capitalism (i.e., its ''[[metabolism]]''). <ref>http://www.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/80841e/80841E00.htm#Contents</ref> . 

Some leading [[conservation movement|conservation]] organizations such as the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] argue that the impact of humanity on Earth is continually increasing. In 2004 they jointly reported that "humanity's Ecological Footprint grew by 150% between 1961 and 2000" and that most of this growth occurred in the 27 wealthiest countries of the world, in other words, the leading capitalist countries. <ref>http://www.panda.org/news_facts/publications/general/livingplanet/lpr04.cfm</ref> Critics note that the statistical methods used in calculating [[Ecological Footprint]] have been criticized and some find the whole concept of counting how much land is used to be flawed, arguing that there is nothing intrinsically negative about using more land to improve living standards (rejection of the [[Intrinsicism|intrinsic]] value of nature). <ref>http://econpapers.repec.org/scripts/redir.pl?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tinbergen.nl%2Fdiscussionpapers%2F98105.pdf;h=repec:dgr:uvatin:19980105</ref><ref>http://www-pam.usc.edu/volume1/v1i1a2print.html</ref> . 

Many environmentalists{{who|date=October 2010}} have long argued that the real dangers are due to the world's current social institutions that they claim promote environmentally irresponsible consumption and production. Under what they call the "grow or die" imperative of capitalism, they say, there is little reason to expect hazardous consumption and production practices to change in a timely manner{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. They also claim that markets and states invariably drag their feet on substantive environmental reform, and are notoriously slow to adopt viable sustainable technologies. <ref>http://www.social-ecology.org/article.php?story=20031118113538865</ref><ref>http://www.monthlyreview.org/1200jbf.htm</ref> Immanuel Wallerstein, referring to the externalization of costs as the "dirty secret" of capitalism, claims that there are built-in limits to ecological reform, and that the costs of doing business in the world capitalist economy are ratcheting upward because of deruralization and democratization. <ref>http://fbc.binghamton.edu/iwecol.htm</ref> . 

Beyond environmental sustainability, there is the question of labor market and consumer market sustainability. In a constant-growth model, new individuals have to be constantly added to the free market economy (as labourers and/or consumers). With birth rates in decline, where will these new consumers and (cheap) labourers come from?<ref>http://books.emeraldinsight.com/display.asp?K=9780444530516&sf1=editor&st1=Mitoshi%20w/2%20Yamaguchi&cur=USD&sort=sort_date/d&m=1&dc=1</ref> . 

===Unemployment===. 
[[Image:Wage labour.svg|Graph of Labor Market|right|380px]]
An analysis of supply and demand of the type shown in introductory [[mainstream economics]] textbooks implies that by mandating a price floor above the equilibrium wage, minimum wage laws should cause unemployment. <ref name=MB>McConnell, C.R. and S.L. Brue, <u>Economics</u>, Irwin-McGraw Hill, 1999, 14th ed., p. 594. </ref><ref name=GSSM>Gwartney, J.D., R.L. Stroup, R.S. Sobel, and D.A. Macpherson, <u>Economics: Private and Public Choice</u>, Thomson South-Western, 2003, 10th ed., p. 97. </ref> This is because a greater number of workers are willing to work at the higher wage while a smaller numbers of jobs will be available at the higher wage. <ref name=MB/><ref name=GSSM/> Companies can be more selective in those whom they employ thus the least skilled and least experienced will typically be excluded. <ref name=MB/><ref name=GSSM/> . 

According to the model shown in nearly all introductory textbooks on economics, increasing the minimum wage decreases the employment of minimum-wage workers. <ref name='Card&Krueger'>David Card and Alan B. Krueger, ''Myth and Measurement: The New Economics of the Minimum Wage'', Princeton University Press, 1995, pp. 1, 6-7. </ref> One textbook says:
<blockquote>
If a higher minimum wage increases the wage rates of unskilled workers above the level that would be established by market forces, the quantity of unskilled workers employed will fall. The minimum wage will price the services of the least productive (and therefore lowest-wage) workers out of the market. ... The direct results of minimum wage legislation are clearly mixed. Some workers, most likely those whose previous wages were closest to the minimum, will enjoy higher wages. Others, particularly those with the lowest prelegislation wage rates, will be unable to find work. They will be pushed into the ranks of the unemployed or out of the labor force. <ref name='Gwartney'>{{cite book | last = Gwartney | first = James D. | authorlink = | coauthors = Richard L.

Another textbook says:
<blockquote>
It is assumed that workers are willing to labor for more hours if paid a higher wage. Economists graph this relationship with the wage on the vertical axis and the quantity (hours) of labor supplied on the horizontal axis. Since higher wages increase the quantity supplied, the supply of labor curve is upward sloping, and is shown as a line moving up and to the right. <ref name=Ehren>Ehrenberg, R. and Smith, R. "Modern labor economics: theory and public policy", HarperCollins, 1994, 5th ed. </ref></blockquote> . 

One of the focal points of the 1914 novel, ''[[The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists]]'', was the issue of employment. The novel is widely regarded as a classic of working-class literature and continues to be in publication today. <ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Ragged-Trousered-Philanthropists-Oxford-Classics/dp/0192804537 The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists] ''Amazon.com US''.

==Criticisms==. 
===Anarchist criticisms===. 
{{Main|Anarchism}} . 

Some [[anarchist]]s argue that capitalist ethics do not entail any positive moral obligation to help others in need. [[libertarian socialism|Libertarian socialist]] [[Noam Chomsky]] writes: "The idea of 'free contract' between the potentate and his starving subject is a sick joke, perhaps worth some moments in an academic seminar exploring the consequences of (in my view, absurd) ideas, but nowhere else."<ref>[http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/chomsky-on-ac.txt Noam Chomsky on anarcho-capitalism]</ref> Other critics regard private property to either be an aggressive institution or a potentially aggressive one, rather than a defensive one, and thus reject claims that relationships based on unequal private property relations could be voluntary. <ref name="capitalism.org">{{cite web|title=Anarchism is not a form of capitalism|url=http://capitalism.org/faq/anarchism.htm|publisher=Capitalism.org|accessdate=6 July 2010}}</ref> Anarchists generally regard capitalism as hierarchical and exploitative. <ref>[http://infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionB1#secb12].

===Marxian criticisms===. 
{{Main|Marxism}} . 

[[Karl Marx]] saw capitalism as a historical stage, once progressive but would eventually stagnate due to internal contradictions and would eventually be followed by socialism. Marxists define [[capital (economics)|capital]] as "a social, economic relation" between people (rather than between people and things). In this sense they seek to abolish capital. They believe that private ownership of the means of production enriches capitalists (owners of capital) at the expense of workers ("the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer"). In brief, they argue that the owners of the means of production do not work and therefore [[Exploitation#Marxian theory|exploit]] the workerforce. In Karl Marx's view, the capitalists would eventually accumulate more and more capital impoverishing the working class, creating the social conditions for a revolution that would overthrow the institutions of capitalism. Private ownership over the means of production and distribution is seen as a dependency of non-owning classes on the ruling class, and ultimately a source of restriction of human freedom.  . 

Marxists have offered various related lines of argument claiming that capitalism is a contradiction-laden system characterized by recurring crises having a tendency towards increasing severity. They have argued that this tendency of the system to unravel combined with a socialization process that links workers in a worldwide market are two major factors that create the objective conditions for revolutionary change. Capitalism is seen as just one stage in the evolution of the economic system. Immanuel Wallerstein, approaching matters from a world-systems perspective, cites the intransigence of rising real wages, rising costs of material inputs, and steadily rising tax rates, along with the rise of popular antisystemic movements as the most important global secular trends creating unprecedented limiting pressures on the accumulation of capital. According to [[Wallerstein]], "the capitalist world-economy has now entered its terminal crisis, a crisis that may last up to fifty years. The real question before us is what will happen during this crisis, this transition from the present world-system to some other kind of historical system or systems." <ref>Wallerstein, Immanuel- The Decline of American Power,New Press Books,66</ref> . 

Normative Marxism advocates for a revolutionary overthrow of capitalism that would lead to socialism, before eventually transforming into [[communism]] after class antagonisms and the state ceased to exist. Marxism influenced social democratic and [[List of Labour Parties|labour parties]] as well as some moderate [[democratic socialists]], who seek change through existing democratic channels instead of revolution, and believe that capitalism should be regulated rather than abolished, supplementing the market economy with a mixed economy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} . 

Marxist and feminist geographers critique capitalism primarily on the basis of social and environmental justice.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Marxian development geographers analyse the "contractions" of capitalism, class struggle, uneven development and imperialism in the global South by employing historical-material analysis (‘little d’ development).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} This work investigates patterns of accumulation, class formation and politics in rural and urban areas, the role of the state, struggles over resources and the articulation of peasant production with agrarian capitalism. Feminist political-economy researchers are interested in the ways that these processes are gendered and also take into account a serious consideration of social reproduction in concern with capitalist production processes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} . 

In [[mainland China]] differences in terminology sometimes confuse and complicate discussions of [[Chinese economic reform]]. Under Marxist ideology, capitalism refers to a stage of history in which there is a class system in which the proletariat is exploited by the bourgeoisie. Officially, according to the Chinese governments State ideology, China is currently in the primary stage of [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} However, because of [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s and subsequent leaders Chinese economic reforms, instituting [[pragmatism]] within policy, China has undertaken policies that are commonly considered capitalistic, including employing wage labor, increasing unemployment to motivate those who are still working{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}, transforming state owned enterprises into joint stock companies, and encouraging the growth of the joint venture and private capitalist sectors. A contrary Marxist view would describe China as just another variant of capitalism ([[state capitalism]]), much like the former USSR, which was also claiming to be operating on principals of socialism. This is echoed by what Mao Tse-Tung termed "[[capitalist roader]]s" who he argued existed within the ruling Party structures and would try to restore the bourgeoisie and thus their class interests to power reflected in new policies, while only keeping the outer appearance of socialism for legitimacy purposes. Deng Xiaoping was identified as one of these "capitalist roaders" during the Chinese Cultural Revolution, when he was placed under house arrest.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} . 

===Socialist criticisms===. 
{{Main|Socialism}} . 

Socialists argue that the accumulation of capital generates waste through externalities that require costly corrective regulatory measures. They also point out that this process generates wasteful industries and practices that exist only to generate sufficient demand for products to be sold at a profit (such as high-pressure advertisement); thereby creating rather than satisfying economic demand. <ref>''Let's produce for use, not profit''. Retrieved January 08, 2011, from worldsocialism.org: http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/may10/page23.html</ref><ref>''What Needs to be Done: A Socialist View''. Retrieved January 08, 2011, from monthlyreview.org: http://www.monthlyreview.org/091109magdoff-yates.php</ref> . 

Socialists argue that capitalism consists of irrational activity, such as the purchasing of commodities only to sell at a later time when their price appreciates, rather than for consumption, even if the commodity cannot be sold at a profit to individuals in need; therefore, a crucial criticism often made by socialists is that ''making money'', or accumulation of capital, does not correspond to the satisfaction of demand (the production of [[use-value]]s). <ref>''Let's produce for use, not profit''. Retrieved August 07, 2010, from worldsocialism.org: http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/may10/page23.html</ref> The fundamental criterion for economic activity in capitalism is the accumulation of capital for reinvestment in production; this spurs the development of new, non-productive industries that don't produce use-value and only exist to keep the accumulation process afloat (otherwise the system goes into crisis), such as the spread of the [[Financialization|financial industry]], contributing to the formation of economic bubbles. <ref>''Economic Crisis from a Socialist Perspective''. Retrieved June 23, 2011, from rdwolff.com: http://www.rdwolff.com/content/economic-crisis-socialist-perspective</ref> . 

Socialists view [[private property]] relations as limiting the potential of productive forces in the economy. According to socialists, private property becomes obsolete when it concentrates into centralized, socialized institutions based on private appropriation of revenue (but based on cooperative work and internal planning in allocation of inputs) until the role of the capitalist becomes redundant. <ref>Engels, Fredrich. ''Socialism: Utopian and Scientific''. Retrieved October 30, 2010, from Marxists.org: http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch03.htm, "The bourgeoisie demonstrated to be a superfluous class. All its social functions are now performed by salaried employees."</ref> With no need for [[capital accumulation]] and a class of owners, private property in the means of production is perceived as being an outdated form of economic organization that should be replaced by a [[free association (communism and anarchism)|free association]] of individuals based on public or [[common ownership]] of these socialized assets. <ref>''The Political Economy of Socialism'', by Horvat, Branko. 1982. Chapter 1: Capitalism, The General Pattern of Capitalist Development (P.15-20)</ref><ref name="Engels Selected Works 1968, p. 40">Marx and Engels Selected Works, Lawrence and Wishart, 1968, p. 40. Capitalist property relations put a "fetter" on the productive forces. </ref> Private ownership imposes constraints on planning, leading to uncoordinated economic decisions that result in business fluctuations, unemployment and a tremendous waste of material resources during crisis of [[overproduction]]. <ref name="The Political Economy of Socialism 1982. P.197">''The Political Economy of Socialism'', by Horvat, Branko. 1982. (P.197)</ref> . 

Excessive disparities in income distribution lead to social instability and require costly corrective measures in the form of redistributive taxation, which incurs heavy administrative costs while weakening the incentive to work, inviting dishonesty and increasing the likelihood of tax evasion while (the corrective measures) reduce the overall efficiency of the market economy. <ref name="The Political Economy of Socialism 1982. P.197-198">''The Political Economy of Socialism'', by Horvat, Branko. 1982. (P.197-198)</ref> These corrective policies limit the incentive system of the market by providing things such as minimum wages, unemployment insurance, taxing profits and reducing the reserve army of labor, resulting in reduced incentives for capitalists to invest in more production. In essence, social welfare policies cripple the capitalism and its incentive system and are thus unsustainable in the long-run. <ref name="Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists, 1998. P.60-61">''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists'', 1998. P.60-61"</ref> Marxists argue that the establishment of a [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialist mode of production]] is the only way to overcome these deficiencies. Socialists and specifically [[Marxian Socialism|Marxian socialists]], argue that the inherent conflict of interests between the working class and capital prevent optimal use of available human resources and leads to contradictory interest groups (labor and business) striving to influence the state to intervene in the economy in their favor at the expense of overall economic efficiency.  . 

Early socialists ([[Utopian socialist]]s and [[Ricardian socialism|Ricardian socialists]]) criticized capitalism for concentrating [[power (philosophy)|power]] and [[wealth]] within a small segment of society that controls the means of production and derives its wealth through a system of exploitation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} This creates a stratified society based on [[Social equality|unequal]] social relations that fails to provide equal opportunities for every individual to maximize their potential,<ref>in Encyclopædia Britannica (2009).

===Religious criticisms===. 
[[Image:Christus austreibt.JPG|right|thumb| "Christ drives the Usurers out of the Temple", a woodcut by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] in ''Passionary of Christ and Antichrist''. <ref>The references cited in the Passionary for this woodcut: {{bibleverse|1|John|2:14-16|9}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|10:8|9}}, and [http://www.bookofconcord.com/defense_6_church.php The Apology of the Augsburg Confession, Article 8, Of the Church]</ref>]] . 

Many religions have criticized or opposed specific elements of capitalism; traditional [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]] forbid [[Usury|lending money at interest]]. Christianity has been a source of both praise and criticism for capitalism, particularly its [[Economic materialism|materialist]] aspects. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P8C.HTM#-2FX|title=III. The Social Doctrine of the Church|publisher=The Vatican|accessdate=2008-02-26}}</ref> The first socialists drew many of their principles from Christian values, against "[[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]" values of profiteering, greed, selfishness, and hoarding.  . 

Some Christian critics of capitalism may not oppose capitalism entirely, but support a mixed economy in order to ensure adequate labor standards and relations, as well as economic justice. 
[[Pope Benedict XVI]] issued an [[encyclical]] [[Caritas in veritate]] (Charity in Truth) in 2009; he stated: "The dignity of the individual and the demands of justice require, particularly today, that economic choices do not cause disparities in wealth to increase in an excessive and morally unacceptable manner."<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20090629_caritas-in-veritate_en.html Caritas in veritate paragraph 32]</ref> and "Therefore, it must be borne in mind that grave imbalances are produced when economic action, conceived merely as an engine for wealth creation, is detached from political action, conceived as a means for pursuing justice through redistribution."<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20090629_caritas-in-veritate_en.html Caritas in veritate paragraph 36]</ref> . 

Islamic law recognizes the right to private property but regulates economic activities. A 2.5% alms tax ([[Zakat]]) is levied on all gold, crops, and cattle. Shia Twelver Muslims pay an additional 20% on all savings (defined as income minus expenses on necessities like food and shelter.) Usury or [[riba]] is forbidden, and religious law encourages the use of capital to spur economic activity while placing the burden of risk along with the benefit of profit with the owner of the capital. Methods of [[Islamic banking]] have been developed. The Islamic constitution of Iran, which was drafted mostly by Islamic clerics, criticizes "materialist schools of thought" that encourage "concentration and accumulation of wealth and maximization of profit."<ref>[http://www.servat.unibe.ch/law/icl/ir00000_.html ICL - Iran - Constitution<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Sayyid Qutb]], an [[Islamism|Islamist]] writer, criticized capitalism in his 1951 book ''The Battle Between Islam and Capitalism''. <ref>[http://www.nndb.com/people/551/000113212/ Sayyid Qutb<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> .
