The term ''capitalist'' as referring to an owner of capital (rather than its meaning of someone adherent to the economic system) shows earlier recorded use than the term ''capitalism'', dating back to the mid-seventeenth century. ''Capitalist'' is derived from ''capital'', which evolved from ''capitale'', a late [[Latin]] word based on [[proto-Indo-European language|proto-Indo-European]] ''caput'', meaning "head" — also the origin of ''[[chattel]]'' and ''[[cattle]]'' in the sense of movable property (only much later to refer only to livestock). Capitale emerged in the 12th to 13th centuries in the sense of referring to funds, stock of merchandise, sum of money, or money carrying interest. <ref name="Braudel on capitalism">Braudel p.232</ref><ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cattle Etymology of "Cattle"]</ref><ref name="OED">James Augustus Henry Murray. "Capital". [http://www.archive.org/details/oedvol02 A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles]. ''Oxford English Press''.

It was frequently interchanged with a number of other words — wealth, money, funds, goods, assets, property and so on. <ref name="Braudel on capitalism">Braudel p.233</ref> .

[[Benjamin Disraeli]] used the term ''capitalist'' in his 1845 work ''[[Sybil (novel)|Sybil]]''. <ref name="OED"/> [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] used the term ''capitalist'' (''Kapitalist'') in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848) to refer to a private owner of capital.  . 

According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED), the term ''capitalism'' was first used by novelist [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] in 1854 in ''[[The Newcomes]]'', where he meant "having ownership of capital". <ref name="OED">James Augustus Henry Murray. "Capitalism" page 94. </ref> Also according to the OED, [[Carl Adolph Douai]], a [[German-American]] [[Socialism|socialist]] and [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]], used the term ''private capitalism'' in 1863.  . 

The initial usage of the term ''capitalism'' in its modern sense has been attributed to [[Louis Blanc]] in 1850 and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in 1861. <ref>Braudel, Fernand. The Wheels of Commerce: Civilization and Capitalism 15–18 Century, Harper and Row, 1979, p.237</ref> Marx and Engels referred to the ''capitalistic system'' (''kapitalistisches System'')<ref>Karl Marx.

Marx did not extensively use the form ''capitalism'', but instead those of ''capitalist'' and ''capitalist mode of production'', which appear more than 2600 times in the trilogy ''Das Kapital''.  . 

Marx's notion of the capitalist mode of production is characterised as a system of primarily private ownership of the means of production in a mainly market economy, with a legal framework on [[commerce]] and a physical [[infrastructure]] provided by the state. No legal framework was available to protect the labourers, so exploitation by the companies was rife. <ref>Karl Marx. ''Das Kapital''. </ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} Engels made more frequent use of the term ''capitalism''; volumes II and III of ''Das Kapital'', both edited by Engels after Marx's death, contain the word "capitalism" four and three times, respectively. The three combined volumes of ''Das Kapital'' (1867, 1885, 1894) contain the word ''capitalist'' more than 2,600 times.  . 

An 1877 work entitled ''Better Times'' by Hugh Gabutt and an 1884 article in the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'' also used the term ''capitalism''. <ref name="OED"/> A later use of the term ''capitalism'' to describe the production system was by the German economist [[Werner Sombart]], in his 1902 book ''The Jews and Modern Capitalism'' (''Die Juden und das Wirtschaftsleben''). Sombart's close friend and colleague, [[Max Weber]], also used ''capitalism'' in his 1904 book ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (''Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus'').  . 

==Economic elements==. 
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2010}}
Capitalist economics developed out of the interactions of the following elements.  . 

A [[Product (business)|product]] is any good produced for exchange on a market. "Commodities" refers to standard products, especially raw materials such as grains and metals, that are not associated with particular producers or brands and trade on organized exchanges.  . 

There are two types of products: [[capital good]]s and [[Final goods|consumer goods]]. Capital goods (i.e., raw materials, tools, industrial machines, vehicles and factories) are used to produce consumer goods (e.g., televisions, cars, computers, houses) to be sold to others. The three inputs required for production are labour, land (i.e., natural resources, which exist prior to human beings) and capital goods. Capitalism entails the private ownership of the latter two — natural resources and capital goods — by a class of owners called capitalists, either individually, collectively or through a state apparatus that operates for a profit or serves the interests of capital owners.  . 

Money was primarily a standardized medium of exchange, and final means of payment, that serves to measure the value all goods and commodities in a standard of value. It eliminates the cumbersome system of [[barter]] by separating the transactions involved in the exchange of products, thus greatly facilitating specialization and trade through encouraging the exchange of commodities. Capitalism involves the further abstraction of money into other exchangeable assets and the accumulation of money through ownership, exchange, interest and various other financial instruments.  . 

[[Labour (economics)|Labour]] includes all physical and mental human resources, including entrepreneurial capacity and management skills, which are needed to produce products and services. [[Manufacturing|Production]] is the act of making products or services by applying [[labour power]] to the means of production. <ref>Ragan, Christopher T.S., and Richard G. Lipsey. Microeconomics. Twelfth Canadian Edition ed. Toronto: Pearson Education Canada, 2008. Print. </ref><ref>Robbins, Richard H. Global problems and the culture of capitalism. Boston: Allyn & Bacon, 2007. Print. </ref> . 

Capitalism is the system of raising, conserving and spending a set monetary value in a specified market. There are three main markets in your basic capitalistic economy which are labor, goods and services, and financial. Labor markets (people) make products and get paid for work by the goods and services market (companies, firms, or corporations, etc.) which then sells the products back to the laborers. However both of the first two markets pays in to and receive benefits from the financial market, which handles and regulates the actual money in the economic system. This includes banks, credit-unions, stock exchanges, etc. On a monetary stand point governments control just how much money is in circulation worldwide which plays an immense role on how money is spent in our own country.  . 

Most of these institutes focus on a form of economics called macroeconomics which keeps its eyes on things such as inflation: the rate at which money loses its value over time; growth: how much money a government has and how quickly it accrues money; unemployment, and rates of trade between other countries. Whereas microeconomics deals with individual firms, people, and other institutions that work within a set frame work of rules to balance prices and the workings of a singular government.  . 

Both micro and macroeconomics work together to form a singular set of evolving rules and regulations. The governments (the macroeconomic side) set both national and international regulations that keep track of prices and corporation’s (microeconomics) growth rates, set prices, and trade while the corporations influence what federal laws are set. <ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Timothy|title=Principles of Economics: Economics and the Economy|year=2011|publisher=Textbook Media|location=USA|isbn=1-930789-13-0|pages=744|url=http://www.texbookmedia.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Reisman|first=George|title=ECONOMICS AND CAPITALISM|url=http://www.capitalism.net/Capitalism/Economics%20and%20Capitalism.htm|work=CAPITALISM: A TREATISE ON ECONOMICS|publisher=The Jefferson School of Philosophy, Economics, and Psychology|accessdate=2012-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Scott|first=Bruce R.|title=The Political Economy of Capitalism Bruce R.|url=http://www.hbs.edu/research/pdf/07-037.pdf|publisher=Harvard Business School|accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref> . 

==Types of capitalism==. 
{{Economics sidebar}}
There are many variants of capitalism in existence. All these forms of capitalism are based on production for profit, at least a moderate degree of market allocation and capital accumulation. The dominant forms of capitalism are listed here.  . 

===Mercantilism===. 
{{Main|Mercantilism}}
{{See also|Protectionism}}
A nationalist form of early capitalism where national business interests are tied to state interests, and consequently, the state apparatus is utilized to advance national business interests abroad. An example of this is colonists living in America who were only allowed to trade with and purchase goods from their respective mother countries (Britain, France, etc.). Mercantilism holds that the wealth of a nation is increased through a positive balance of trade with other nations.  . 

===Free-market capitalism===. 
{{Main|Free market}}
{{See also|Laissez-faire}}
Free market capitalism consists of a free-price system where supply and demand are allowed to reach their point of equilibrium without intervention by the government. Productive enterprises are privately owned, and the role of the state is limited to protecting the rights to life, liberty, and property.  . 

===Social market economy===. 
{{Main|Social market}}
A social market economy is a nominally free-market system where government intervention in price formation is kept to a minimum but the state provides significant social security, unemployment benefits and recognition of labour rights through national collective bargaining laws. The social market is based on private ownership of businesses.  . 

===State capitalism===. 
{{Main|State capitalism}}
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}
State capitalism consists of state ownership of the means of production within a state. Capitalism is the physical work process by which wealth is created in excess of the quantity consumed in the production of it, regardless of whether that process is operated by private individuals and companies or by the government. The debate between proponents of private versus state capitalism is centered around questions of managerial efficacy, productive efficiency, and fairest in the distribution of the wealth created.  . 

===Corporate capitalism===. 
{{Main|Corporate capitalism}}
{{See also|State monopoly capitalism}}
Corporate capitalism is a free or mixed market characterized by the dominance of hierarchical, bureaucratic corporations, which are legally required to pursue profit. State monopoly capitalism was originally a [[Marxist]] concept referring to a form of corporate capitalism where the state is used to benefit, protect from competition and promote the interests of dominant or established corporations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} . 

===Mixed economy===. 
{{Main|Mixed economy}}
A largely market-based economy consisting of both public ownership and private ownership of the means of production. Most capitalist economies are defined as "mixed economies" to some degree {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} although the balance between the public and private sectors may vary.  . 

===Other===.

{{Main|History of capitalism}} . 

Economic trade for profit has existed since the second millennium BC. <ref name="WarburtonDavid">Warburton, David, Macroeconomics from the beginning: The General Theory, Ancient Markets, and the Rate of Interest. Paris: Recherches et Publications, 2003.p49</ref> However, capitalism in its modern form is usually traced to the Mercantilism of the 16th-18th Centuries.  . 

===Mercantilism===. 
{{Main|Mercantilism}}
[[File:Lorrain.seaport.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A painting of a French seaport from 1638 at the height of [[mercantilism]].]]
The period between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries is commonly described as [[mercantilism]]. <ref name="Burnham">{{Cite book|author=Burnham, Peter|title=Capitalism: The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003}}</ref> This period, the [[Age of Discovery]], was associated with geographic exploration being exploited by merchant overseas traders, especially from England and the [[Low Countries]]; the [[European colonization of the Americas]]; and the rapid growth in overseas trade. Mercantilism was a system of trade for profit, although commodities were still largely produced by non-capitalist production methods. <ref name="Scott" /> . 

While some scholars see mercantilism as the earliest stage of capitalism, others argue that capitalism did not emerge until later. For example, [[Karl Polanyi]], noted that "mercantilism, with all its tendency toward commercialization, never attacked the safeguards which protected [the] two basic elements of production—labour and land—from becoming the elements of commerce"; thus mercantilist attitudes towards economic regulation were closer to feudalist attitudes, "they disagreed only on the methods of regulation." . 

Moreover Polanyi argued that the hallmark of capitalism is the establishment of generalized markets for what he referred to as the "fictitious commodities": land, labour, and money. Accordingly, "not until 1834 was a competitive labour market established in England, hence industrial capitalism as a social system cannot be said to have existed before that date."<ref>Polanyi, Karl. The Great Transformation. Beacon Press, Boston.1944.p87</ref> . 

Evidence of long-distance merchant-driven trade motivated by profit has been found as early as the second millennium BC, with the Old Assyrian merchants. <ref name="WarburtonDavid" /> The earliest forms of mercantilism date back to the [[Roman Empire]]. When the Roman Empire expanded, the mercantilist economy expanded throughout Europe. After the [[decline of the Roman Empire|collapse of the Roman Empire]], most of the European economy became controlled by local [[feudal]] powers, and mercantilism collapsed there. However, mercantilism persisted in [[Arabia]]. Due to its proximity to neighboring countries, the Arabs established trade routes to [[Egypt]], [[Persia]], and [[Byzantium]]. As [[Islam]] spread in the seventh century, mercantilism spread rapidly to Spain, Portugal, [[Northern Africa]], and Asia. Mercantilism finally revived in Europe in the fourteenth century, as mercantilism spread from Spain and Portugal. <ref>[http://history.howstuffworks.com/european-history/capitalism3.htm The Rise of Capitalism]</ref> . 

Among the major tenets of mercantilist theory was [[bullionism]], a doctrine stressing the importance of accumulating [[precious metals]]. Mercantilists argued that a state should export more goods than it imported so that foreigners would have to pay the difference in precious metals. Mercantilists argued that only raw materials that could not be extracted at home should be imported; and promoted government [[subsidy|subsidies]], such as the granting of monopolies and protective [[tariff]]s, which mercantilists thought were necessary to encourage home production of manufactured goods.  . 

[[File:Clive.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Robert Clive]] after the [[Battle of Plassey]]. The battle began [[East India Company]] rule in India.]]
European [[merchant]]s, backed by state controls, subsidies, and [[monopoly|monopolies]], made most of their profits from the buying and selling of goods. In the words of [[Francis Bacon]], the purpose of mercantilism was "the opening and well-balancing of trade; the cherishing of manufacturers; the banishing of idleness; the repressing of waste and excess by sumptuary laws; the improvement and husbanding of the soil; the regulation of prices…"<ref>Quoted in Sir George Clark, ''The Seventeenth Century'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1961), p. 24. </ref> . 

Similar practices of economic regimentation had begun earlier in the medieval towns. However, under mercantilism, given the contemporaneous rise of [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]], the state superseded the local [[guild]]s as the regulator of the economy. During that time the guilds essentially functioned like [[cartels]] that monopolized the quantity of craftsmen to earn above-market wages. <ref>Mancur Olson, The rise and decline of nations: economic growth, stagflation, and social rigidities (New Haven & London 1982). </ref> . 

At the period from the eighteenth century, the commercial stage of capitalism originated from the start of the British East India Company and the [[Dutch East India Company]]. <ref name=Banaji>{{Cite journal|author=Banaji, Jairus|year=2007|title=Islam, the Mediterranean and the rise of capitalism|journal=Journal Historical Materialism|volume=15|pages=47–74|publisher=Brill Publishers|doi=10.1163/156920607X171591}}</ref><ref name="britannica2">{{Cite book|title=Economic system :: Market systems|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/178493/economic-system/61117/Market-systems#toc242146|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2006}}</ref> These companies were characterized by their [[colonialism|colonial]] and [[expansionism|expansionary]] powers given to them by nation-states. <ref name="Banaji" /> During this era, merchants, who had traded under the previous stage of mercantilism, invested capital in the East India Companies and other colonies, seeking a [[return on investment]]. In his "History of Economic Analysis," Austrian economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] reduced mercantilist propositions to three main concerns: exchange controls, export monopolism and balance of trade. <ref>Schumpeter, J.A. (1954) History of Economic Analysis</ref> . 

===Industrialism===. 
{{See also|Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|250px|thumb|A [[Watt steam engine]]. The [[steam engine]] fuelled primarily by [[coal]] propelled the [[Industrial Revolution]] in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]]. <ref>Watt steam engine image: located in the lobby of into the Superior Technical School of Industrial Engineers of a the UPM ([[Madrid]])</ref>]]
A new group of economic theorists, led by [[David Hume]]<ref>{{Cite book|author=Hume, David|title=Political Discourses|location=Edinburgh|publisher=A. Kincaid &amp; A. Donaldson|year=1752}}</ref> and [[Adam Smith]], in the mid 18th century, challenged fundamental [[mercantilist]] doctrines as the belief that the amount of the world’s wealth remained constant and that a state could only increase its wealth at the expense of another state.  . 

During the Industrial Revolution, the industrialist replaced the merchant as a dominant actor in the capitalist system and affected the decline of the traditional handicraft skills of [[artisan]]s, guilds, and [[journeyman|journeymen]]. Also during this period, the surplus generated by the rise of commercial agriculture encouraged increased mechanization of agriculture. Industrial capitalism marked the development of the [[factory]] system of manufacturing, characterized by a complex [[division of labor]] between and within work process and the routine of work tasks; and finally established the global domination of the capitalist mode of production. <ref name="Burnham" /> . 

Britain also abandoned its [[protectionist]] policy, as embraced by mercantilism. In the 19th century, [[Richard Cobden]] and [[John Bright]], who based their beliefs on the [[Manchester capitalism|Manchester School]], initiated a movement to lower tariffs. <ref name="laissezf">{{Cite web|title=laissez-faire|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/la/laissezf.html}}</ref> In the 1840s, Britain adopted a less protectionist policy, with the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] and the [[Navigation Acts]]. <ref name="Burnham" /> Britain reduced [[tariffs]] and [[import quota|quotas]], in line with Adam Smith and David Ricardo's advocacy for [[free trade]].  . 

Karl Polanyi argued that capitalism did not emerge until the progressive commodification of land, money, and labour culminating in the establishment of a generalized labour market in Britain in the 1830s. For Polanyi, "the extension of the market to the elements of industry – land, labour and money – was the inevitable consequence of the introduction of the factory system in a commercial society."<ref>Polanyi, Karl. The Great Transformation, Beacon Press. Boston. 1944. p.78</ref> Other sources argued that mercantilism fell after the repeal of the Navigation Acts in 1849. <ref name="laissezf"/><ref>{{Cite web|title=Navigation Acts

===Keynesianism and neoliberalism===. 
{{Main|Keynesianism|Neoliberalism}}
In the period following the global depression of the 1930s, the state played an increasingly prominent role in the capitalistic system throughout much of the world.  . 

[[File:NY stock exchange traders floor LC-U9-10548-6.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The New York [[stock exchange]] [[trading room|traders' floor]] (1963)]] . 

After [[World War II]], a broad array of new analytical tools in the [[social sciences]] were developed to explain the social and economic trends of the period, including the concepts of [[post-industrial society]] and the [[welfare state]]. <ref name="Burnham" /> This era was greatly influenced by [[Keynesian]] economic stabilization policies. The postwar boom ended in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the situation was worsened by the rise of [[stagflation]]. <ref>{{Cite book|author=Barnes, Trevor J.|title=Reading economic geography|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=063123554X|pages=127|year=2004}}</ref> . 

Exceptionally high [[inflation]] combined with slow output growth, rising unemployment, and eventually [[recession]] to cause a loss of credibility in the Keynesian welfare-statist mode of regulation. Under the influence of [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Milton Friedman]], Western states embraced policy prescriptions inspired by [[laissez-faire]] capitalism and [[classical liberalism]].  . 

In particular, [[monetarism]], a theoretical alternative to Keynesianism that is more compatible with laissez-faire, gained increasing prominence in the capitalist world, especially under the leadership of [[Ronald Reagan]] in the US and [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the UK in the 1980s.  Public and political interest began shifting away from the so-called [[collectivist]] concerns of Keynes's managed capitalism to a focus on individual choice, called "remarketized capitalism." <ref name="Fulcher, James 2004">Fulcher, James. Capitalism. 1st ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 2004. </ref>  In the eyes of many economic and political commentators, the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] brought further evidence of the superiority of market capitalism over planned economy.  .

Although [[international trade]] has been associated with the development of capitalism for over five hundred years, some thinkers argue that a number of trends associated with [[globalization]] have acted to increase the mobility of people and capital since the last quarter of the 20th century, combining to circumscribe the room to maneuver of states in choosing non-capitalist models of development. Today, these trends have bolstered the argument that capitalism should now be viewed as a truly [[world government|world system]]. <ref name="Burnham" /> However, other thinkers argue that globalization, even in its quantitative degree, is no greater now than during earlier periods of capitalist trade. <ref>{{Cite book|title=After the New Economy |last=Henwood |first=Doug |publisher=New Press |date=1 October 2003 |isbn=1-56584-770-9}}</ref> .

===Classical political economy===. 
{{Main|Classical economics|Classical liberalism}} . 

[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|right|[[Adam Smith]]]]
The [[classical economics|classical school of economic thought]] emerged in Britain in the late 18th century. The classical political economists [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]], [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], and [[John Stuart Mill]] published analyses of the production, distribution and exchange of goods in a [[market]] that have since formed the basis of study for most contemporary economists.  . 

In France, 'Physiocrats' like [[François Quesnay]] promoted [[free trade]] based on a conception that wealth originated from land. Quesnay's ''Tableau Économique'' (1759), described the economy analytically and laid the foundation of the Physiocrats' economic theory, followed by [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot]] who opposed tariffs and [[customs duties]] and advocated [[free trade]]. [[Richard Cantillon]] defined long-run equilibrium as the balance of flows of income, and argued that the [[supply and demand]] mechanism around land influenced short-term prices.  . 

Smith's attack on [[mercantilism]] and his reasoning for "the system of natural liberty" in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776) are usually taken as the beginning of classical political economy. Smith devised a set of concepts that remain strongly associated with capitalism today. His theories regarding the "[[invisible hand]]" are commonly misinterpreted to mean individual pursuit of self-interest unintentionally producing collective good for society. <ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand#The_Wealth_of_Nations</ref> It was necessary for Smith to be so forceful in his argument in favor of free markets because he had to overcome the popular mercantilist sentiment of the time period. <ref>Degen, Robert. ''The Triumph of Capitalism''. 1st ed. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2008. </ref> . 

He criticized monopolies, tariffs, duties, and other state enforced restrictions of his time and believed that the market is the most fair and efficient arbitrator of resources. This view was shared by [[David Ricardo]], second most important of the classical political economists and one of the most influential economists of modern times. <ref>{{Cite book|author=Hunt, E.K.|title=History of Economic Thought: A Critical Perspective|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2002|pages=92}}</ref> . 

In ''The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'' (1817), he developed the law of [[comparative advantage]], which explains why it is profitable for two parties to trade, even if one of the trading partners is more efficient in every type of economic production. This principle supports the economic case for [[free trade]]. Ricardo was a supporter of [[Say's Law]] and held the view that full employment is the normal equilibrium for a competitive economy. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=1991|pages=91}}</ref> He also argued that [[inflation]] is closely related to changes in quantity of money and [[Credit (finance)|credit]] and was a proponent of the law of [[diminishing returns]], which states that each additional unit of input yields less and less additional output. <ref name="Skousen2001">{{Cite book|author=Skousen, Mark|title=The Making of Modern Economics: The Lives and Ideas of the Great Thinkers|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2001|pages=98–102, 134}}</ref> . 

The values of classical political economy are strongly associated with the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] doctrine of minimal government intervention in the economy, though it does not necessarily oppose the state's provision of a few basic [[public goods]]. <ref name="aaron2003">Eric Aaron, ''What's Right?'' (Dural, Australia: Rosenberg Publishing, 2003), 75. </ref> Classical liberal thought has generally assumed a clear division between the economy and other realms of social activity, such as the state. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Capitalism: Dictionary of the Social Sciences|author=Calhoun, Craig|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002}}</ref> . 

While economic liberalism favors markets unfettered by the government, it maintains that the state has a legitimate role in providing [[public good]]s. <ref name = "econlib"/> For instance, Adam Smith argued that the state has a role in providing roads, canals, schools and bridges that cannot be efficiently implemented by private entities. However, he preferred that these goods should be paid proportionally to their consumption (e.g. putting a [[Toll road|toll]]). In addition, he advocated [[Free trade area|retaliatory tariffs]] to bring about free trade, and [[copyright]]s and [[patent]]s to encourage innovation. <ref name=econlib>{{Cite web|title=Adam Smith|publisher=econlib.org|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Smith.html}}</ref> . 

===Marxist political economy===. 
{{Main|Marxian economics}}
[[Karl Marx]] considered capitalism to be a historically specific [[mode of production]] (the way in which the productive property is owned and controlled, combined with the corresponding [[social relations of production|social relations]] between individuals based on their connection with the process of production) in which capitalism has become the dominant mode of production. <ref name="Burnham"/> . 

The capitalist stage of development or "[[bourgeois]] society," for Marx, represented the most advanced form of social organization to date, but he also thought that the working classes would come to power in a worldwide [[socialism|socialist]] or [[communism|communist]] transformation of human society as the end of the series of first aristocratic, then capitalist, and finally working class rule was reached. <ref>[[The Communist Manifesto]]</ref><ref>"To Marx, the problem of reconstituting society did not arise from some prescription, motivated by his personal predilections; it followed, as an iron-clad historical necessity – on the one hand, from the productive forces grown to powerful maturity; on the other, from the impossibility further to organize these forces according to the will of the [[law of value]]." - [[Leon Trotsky]], "Marxism in our Time", 1939 (Inevitability of Socialism), [http://wsws.org/articles/2008/nov2008/time-n01.shtml WSWS.org]</ref>
[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Karl Marx]]]]
Following [[Adam Smith]], Marx distinguished the [[use value]] of commodities from their [[exchange value]] in the market. Capital, according to Marx, is created with the purchase of commodities for the purpose of creating new commodities with an exchange value higher than the sum of the original purchases. For Marx, the use of [[labor power]] had itself become a commodity under capitalism; the exchange value of labor power, as reflected in the wage, is less than the value it produces for the capitalist.  . 

This difference in values, he argues, constitutes [[surplus value]], which the capitalists extract and accumulate. In his book ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]'', Marx argues that the [[capitalist mode of production]] is distinguished by how the owners of capital extract this surplus from workers—all prior class societies had extracted [[surplus labor]], but capitalism was new in doing so via the sale-value of produced commodities. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1894-c3/ch47.htm|title=Capital. v. 3. Chapter 47: Genesis of capitalist ground rent|author=Karl Marx |accessdate=26 February 2008|publisher=Marxists }}</ref> He argues that a core requirement of a capitalist society is that a large portion of the population must not possess sources of self-sustenance that would allow them to be independent, and must instead be compelled, to survive, to sell their labor for a living wage. <ref>Karl Marx.

New York: International Publishers Co., Inc. </ref><ref>David Harvey 1989 ''The Condition of Postmodernity''</ref> . 

In conjunction with his criticism of capitalism was Marx's belief that exploited labor would be the driving force behind a revolution to a socialist-style economy. <ref>Wheen, Francis ''Books That Shook the World: Marx's Das Kapital''1st ed. London: Atlantic Books, 2006</ref> For Marx, this cycle of the extraction of the surplus value by the owners of capital or the [[bourgeoisie]] becomes the basis of [[class struggle]]. This argument is intertwined with Marx's version of the [[labor theory of value]] arguing that labor is the source of all value, and thus of profit.  . 

[[Vladimir Lenin]], in ''[[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]]'' (1916), modified classic Marxist theory and argued that capitalism necessarily induced [[monopoly capitalism]]&mdash;which he also called "imperialism"&mdash;to find new markets and resources, representing the last and highest stage of capitalism. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/index.htm|title=Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism|publisher=Marxists|accessdate=26 February 2008|year=1916}}</ref> Some 20th century [[Marxian economics|Marxian economists]] consider capitalism to be a social formation where capitalist class processes dominate, but are not exclusive. <ref>See, for example, the works of Stephen Resnick and Richard Wolff. </ref> . 

Capitalist class processes, to these thinkers, are simply those in which [[surplus labor]] takes the form of [[surplus value]], usable as capital; other tendencies for utilization of labor nonetheless exist simultaneously in existing societies where capitalist processes are predominant. However, other late Marxian thinkers argue that a social formation as a whole may be classed as capitalist if capitalism is the mode by which a surplus is ''extracted'', even if this surplus is not ''produced'' by capitalist activity, as when an absolute majority of the population is engaged in non-capitalist economic activity. <ref>{{Cite book|author=Ste. Croix, G. E. M. de|title=The Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World|year=1982|pages=52–3}}</ref> . 

In ''Limits to Capital'' (1982), [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] outlines an overdetermined, "spatially restless" capitalism coupled with the spatiality of crisis formation and resolution. Harvey used Marx’s theory of crisis to aid his argument that capitalism must have its “fixes” but that we cannot predetermine what fixes will be implemented, nor in what form they will be. His work on contractions of capital accumulation and international movements of capitalist modes of production and money flows has been influential. <ref name="Lawson, Victoria 2007">Lawson, Victoria.

===Weberian political sociology===. 
[[File:Max Weber 1917.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Max Weber]] in 1917]]
In some [[social science]]s, the understanding of the defining characteristics of capitalism has been strongly influenced by 19th century German social theorist [[Max Weber]]. Weber considered [[market]] [[trade|exchange]], rather than production, as the defining feature of capitalism; capitalist enterprises, in contrast to their counterparts in prior modes of economic activity, was their rationalization of production, directed toward maximizing [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]] and [[Productivity (economics)|productivity]]; a tendency leading to a sociological process of enveloping "rationalization". According to Weber, workers in pre-capitalist economic institutions understood work in terms of a personal relationship between [[Master craftsman|master]] and [[journeyman]] in a [[guild]], or between [[lord]] and [[peasant]] in a [[Manorialism|manor]]. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.humanities.mq.edu.au/Ockham/y64l10.html|title=Max Weber: On Capitalism |accessdate=26 February 2008|publisher=Macquarie University|author=Kilcullen, John|year=1996}}</ref> . 

In his book ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1904–1905), Weber sought to trace how a particular form of religious spirit, infused into traditional modes of economic activity, was a condition of possibility of modern western capitalism.  For Weber, the 'spirit of capitalism' was, in general, that of ascetic Protestantism; this ideology was able to motivate extreme rationalization of daily life, a propensity to accumulate capital by a religious ethic to advance economically, and thus also the propensity to reinvest capital: this was sufficient, then, to create "self-mediating capital" as conceived by Marx.  . 

This is pictured in Proverbs 22:29, “Seest thou a man diligent in his calling? He shall stand before kings” and in Colossians 3:23, "Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord rather than for men."  In the ''Protestant Ethic'', Weber further stated that “moneymaking – provided it is done legally – is, within the modern economic order, the result and the expression of diligence in one’s calling…” . 

And, "If God show you a way in which you may lawfully get more than in another way (without wrong to your soul or to any other), if you refuse this, and choose the less gainful way, you cross one of the ends of your calling, and you refuse to be God's steward, and to accept His gifts and use them for him when He requierth it: you may labour to be rich for God, though not for the flesh and sin" (p.&nbsp;108).  . 

Western capitalism, was, most generally for Weber, the "rational organization of formally free labor." The idea of the "formally free" laborer, meant, in the double sense of Marx, that the laborer was both free to own property, and free of the ability to reproduce his labor power, i.e., was the victim of expropriation of his means of production.  It is only on these conditions, still abundantly obvious in the modern world of Weber, that western capitalism is able to exist.  . 

For Weber, modern western capitalism represented the order "now bound to the technical and economic conditions of machine production which to-day determine the lives of all the individuals who are born into this mechanism, not only those directly concerned with economic acquisition, with irresistible force.  Perhaps it will so determine them until the last ton of fossilized coal is burnt" (p.&nbsp;123). <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.economyandsociety.com/events/Ethic&SpiritCapsm_Conf_Agenda2.pdf|format=PDF|title=Conference Agenda|publisher=Economy and Society|accessdate=26 February 2008}}</ref>  This is further seen in his criticism of "specialists without spirit, [[Hedonism|hedonists]] without a heart" that were developing, in his opinion, with the fading of the original [[Puritan]] "spirit" associated with capitalism.  . 

===Institutional economics===. 
{{Main|Institutional economics}} . 

[[File:Veblen3a.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thorstein Veblen]]]] . 

Institutional economics, once the main school of economic thought in the United States, holds that capitalism cannot be separated from the political and social system within which it is embedded. It emphasizes the legal foundations of capitalism (see [[John R. Commons]]) and the evolutionary, habituated, and volitional processes by which institutions are erected and then changed (see [[John Dewey]], [[Thorstein Veblen]], and [[Daniel Bromley]].) . 

One key figure in institutional economics was [[Thorstein Veblen]] who in his book [[The Theory of the Leisure Class]] (1899) analyzed the motivations of wealthy people in capitalism who [[Conspicuous consumption|conspicuously consumed]] their riches as a way of demonstrating success. The concept of [[conspicuous consumption]] was in direct contradiction to the neoclassical view that capitalism was efficient.  . 

In [[The Theory of Business Enterprise]] (1904) Veblen distinguished the motivations of industrial production for people to use things from business motivations that used, or misused, industrial infrastructure for profit, arguing that the former is often hindered because businesses pursue the latter. Output and technological advance are restricted by business practices and the creation of monopolies. Businesses protect their existing capital investments and employ excessive credit, leading to depressions and increasing military expenditure and war through business control of political power.  . 

===German Historical School and Austrian School===. 
{{Main|Historical school of economics|Austrian School}}
From the perspective of the [[Historical school of economics|German Historical School]], capitalism is primarily identified in terms of the organization of production for [[market]]s. Although this perspective shares similar theoretical roots with that of Weber, its emphasis on markets and money lends it different focus. <ref name="Burnham"/> For followers of the German Historical School, the key shift from traditional modes of economic activity to capitalism involved the shift from medieval restrictions on credit and money to the modern [[monetary system|monetary economy]] combined with an emphasis on the profit motive.  . 

[[File:MisesLibrary.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ludwig von Mises]]]] . 

In the late 19th century, the German Historical School of economics diverged, with the emerging [[Austrian School]] of economics, led at the time by [[Carl Menger]]. Later generations of followers of the Austrian School continued to be influential in Western economic thought in the early part of the 20th century.  . 

Austrian-born economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]], sometimes associated with the School,<ref>David Simpson, (1983) "Joseph Schumpeter and the Austrian School of Economics", '''Journal of Economic Studies''', Vol. 10 Iss: 4, pp.18 - 28</ref> emphasized the "[[creative destruction]]" of capitalism—the fact that market economies undergo constant change. Schumpeter argued that at any moment in time there are rising industries and declining industries. Schumpeter, and many contemporary economists influenced by his work, argue that resources should flow from the declining to the expanding industries for an economy to grow, but they recognized that sometimes resources are slow to withdraw from the declining industries because of various forms of institutional resistance to change.  . 

The Austrian economists [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]] were among the leading defenders of [[market economy]] against 20th century proponents of socialist [[planned economies]]. Mises and Hayek argued that only market capitalism could manage a complex, modern economy.  . 

Since a modern economy produces such a large array of distinct goods and services, and consists of such a large array of consumers and enterprises, argued Mises and Hayek, the information problems facing any other form of economic organization other than market capitalism would exceed its capacity to handle information. Thinkers within [[Supply-side economics]] built on the work of the Austrian School, and particularly emphasize [[Say's Law]]: "supply creates its own demand." Capitalism, to this school, is defined by lack of state restraint on the decisions of producers.  . 

Austrian economists such as [[Murray Rothbard]] argued that [[Karl Marx|Marx]] failed to make the distinction between ''capitalism'' and ''mercantilism''. <ref name="rothbard">{{Cite journal|title=A Future of Peace and Capitalism |last=Rothbard |first=Murray N. |authorlink=Murray N. Rothbard |url=http://www.mises.org/story/1559 |journal=Modern Political Economy |pages=419–430 |location=Boston |publisher=Allyn and Bacon |year=1973|quote=In fact the mercantilist system is essentially what we’ve got right now. There is very little difference between state monopoly capitalism, or corporate state capitalism, whatever you want to call it, in the United States and Western Europe today, and the mercantilist system of the pre-Industrial Revolution era. There are only two differences; one is that their major activity was commerce and ours is industry. But the essential modus operandi of the two systems is exactly the same: monopoly privilege, a complete meshing in what is now called the "partnership of government and industry," a pervasive system of militarism and war contracts, a drive toward war and imperialism; the whole shebang characterized the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Osterfeld |first=David |title=Marxism, Capitalism and Mercantilism| journal=The Review of Austrian Eonomics |volume=5 |issue=1 |issn=0889-304 |year=1991|pages=107–114}}</ref> They argue that Marx conflated the [[imperialistic]], [[colonialistic]], [[protectionist]] and [[economic interventionism|interventionist]] doctrines of mercantilism with capitalism.  . 

Austrian economics has been a major influence on some forms of [[libertarianism]], in which [[laissez-faire]] capitalism is considered to be the ideal economic system. <ref>[http://mises.org/etexts/austrian.asp What is Austrian Economics?], [[Ludwig Von Mises Institute]]. </ref> . 

===Keynesian economics===. 
{{Main|Keynesian economics}}
[[File:John Maynard Keynes.jpg|thumb|[[John Maynard Keynes]]]] . 

In his 1937 ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money]]'', the British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] argued that capitalism suffered a basic problem in its ability to recover from periods of slowdowns in investment. Keynes argued that a capitalist economy could remain in an indefinite [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] despite high [[unemployment]].  . 

Essentially rejecting [[Say's law]], he argued that some people may have a [[liquidity preference]] that would see them rather hold money than buy new goods or services, which therefore raised the prospect that the [[Great Depression]] would not end without what he termed in the ''General Theory'' "a somewhat comprehensive socialization of investment." . 

Keynesian economics challenged the notion that laissez-faire capitalist economics could operate well on their own, without state intervention used to promote [[aggregate demand]], fighting high unemployment and [[Deflation (economics)|deflation]] of the sort seen during the 1930s. He and his followers recommended "[[Deficit spending|pump-priming]]" the economy to avoid [[recession]]: cutting taxes, increasing government borrowing, and spending during an economic down-turn. This was to be accompanied by trying to control wages nationally partly through the use of [[inflation]] to cut real wages and to deter people from holding money. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/mattick-paul/1969/marx-keynes/ch01.htm |title=Marx and Keynes: the limits of the mixed economy |author=Paul Mattick |accessdate=26 February 2008|publisher=Marxists }}</ref> . 

John Maynard Keynes tried to provide solutions to many of Marx’s problems without completely abandoning the classical understanding of capitalism.  His work attempted to show that regulation can be effective, and that economic stabilizers can rein in the aggressive expansions and recessions that Marx disliked.  These changes sought to create more stability in the business cycle, and reduce the abuses of laborers. Keynesian economists argue that Keynesian policies were one of the primary reasons capitalism was able to recover following the Great Depression. <ref>Erhardt III, Erwin. "History of Economic Development." University of Cincinnati. Lindner Center Auditorium, Cincinnati. 7 Nov. 2008. </ref> The premises of Keynes’s work have, however, since been challenged by neoclassical and [[supply-side economics]] and the Austrian School.  . 

Another challenge to Keynesian thinking came from his colleague [[Piero Sraffa]], and subsequently from the [[Neo-Ricardianism|Neo-Ricardian school]] that followed Sraffa. In Sraffa's highly technical analysis, capitalism is defined by an entire system of social relations among both producers and consumers, but with a primary emphasis on the demands of production. According to Sraffa, the tendency of capital to seek its highest [[rate of profit]] causes a dynamic instability in social and economic relations.  . 

===Neoclassical economics and the Chicago School===. 
{{Main|Neoclassical economics}}
Today, the majority of academic research on capitalism in the [[English-speaking world]] draws on [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic thought]]. It favors extensive market coordination and relatively neutral patterns of governmental market regulation aimed at maintaining property rights; deregulated [[labor market]]s; corporate governance dominated by financial owners of firms; and financial systems depending chiefly on [[capital market]]-based financing rather than state financing.  . 

[[File:Portrait of Milton Friedman.jpg|thumb|left|[[Milton Friedman]]]] . 

[[Milton Friedman]] took many of the basic principles set forth by Adam Smith and the classical economists and gave them a new twist. One example of this is his article in the September 1970 issue of ''The New York Times'' Magazine, where he argues that the social responsibility of business is “to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits…(through) open and free competition without deception or fraud.” This is similar to Smith’s argument that self-interest in turn benefits the whole of society. <ref>Friedman, Milton. "The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits." The New York Times Magazine 13 Sep. 1970. </ref> Work like this helped lay the foundations for the coming [[marketization]] (or [[privatization]]) of state enterprises and the [[supply-side economics]] of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]].  . 

The [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School of economics]] is best known for its free market advocacy and [[monetarist]] ideas. According to Friedman and other monetarists, market economies are inherently stable [[laissez-faire|if left to themselves]] and depressions result only from government intervention. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Macroeconomics and New Macroeconomics|author=Felderer, Bernhard}}</ref> . 

Friedman, for example, argued that the [[Great Depression]] was result of a contraction of the money supply, controlled by the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]], and not by the lack of investment as [[John Maynard Keynes]] had argued. [[Ben Bernanke]], current Chairman of the [[Federal Reserve]], is among the economists today generally accepting Friedman's analysis of the causes of the Great Depression. <ref name="fed">{{Cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/BOARDDOCS/SPEECHES/2002/20021108/default.htm|title=Remarks by Governor Ben S. Bernanke  |publisher=The Federal Reserve Board|accessdate=26 February 2008|date=8 November 2002|author=Ben Bernanke}}</ref> . 

Neoclassical economists, today the majority of economists,<ref>{{Cite book|author=Yonary, Yuval P.|title=The Struggle Over the Soul of Economics|year=1998|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691034192|pages=29}}</ref> consider value to be subjective, varying from person to person and for the same person at different times, and thus reject the labor theory of value. [[Marginalism]] is the theory that economic value results from marginal utility and [[marginal cost]] (the [[marginal concepts]]). These economists see capitalists as earning profits by forgoing current consumption, by taking risks, and by organizing production.  . 

==Neoclassical economic theory==. 
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2010}}
Neoclassical economics explain capitalism as made up of individuals, enterprises, markets and government. According to their theories, individuals engage in a capitalist economy as [[consumer]]s, [[laborer|labourers]], and [[investor]]s. As labourers, individuals may decide which jobs to prepare for, and in which markets to look for work. As investors they decide how much of their income to save and how to invest their savings. These savings, which become investments, provide much of the money that businesses need to grow.  . 

Business firms decide what to produce and where this production should occur. They also purchase inputs (materials, labour, and capital). Businesses try to influence consumer purchase decisions through marketing and advertisement, as well as the creation of new and improved products. 
Driving the capitalist economy is the search for profits (revenues minus expenses). This is known as the [[profit motive]], and it helps ensure that companies produce the goods and services that consumers desire and are able to buy. To be profitable, firms must sell a quantity of their product at a certain price to yield a profit. A business may lose money if sales fall too low or if its costs become too high. The profit motive encourages firms to operate more efficiently. By using less materials, labour or capital, a firm can cut its production costs, which can lead to increased profits.  . 

An economy grows when the total value of goods and services produced rises. This growth requires investment in infrastructure, capital and other resources necessary in production. In a capitalist system, businesses decide when and how much they want to invest.  . 

Income in a capitalist economy depends primarily on what skills are in demand and what skills are being supplied. Skills that are in scarce supply are worth more in the market and can attract higher incomes. Competition among workers for jobs — and among employers for skilled workers — help determine wage rates. Firms need to pay high enough wages to attract the appropriate workers; when jobs are scarce, workers may accept lower wages than they would when jobs are plentiful. [[Trade union]] and governments influence wages in capitalist systems. Unions act to represent their members in negotiations with employers over such things as wage rates and acceptable working conditions.  . 

===The market===. 
[[File:Supply-and-demand.svg|thumb|right|240px|The price (P) of a product is determined by a balance between production at each price (supply, S) and the desires of those with [[purchasing power]] at each price (demand, D). This results in a market equilibrium, with a given quantity (Q) sold of the product. A rise in demand would result in an increase in price and an increase in output.]] . 

Supply is the amount of a good or service produced by a firm and which is available for sale. Demand is the amount that people are willing to buy at a specific price. Prices tend to rise when demand exceeds supply, and fall when supply exceeds demand. In theory, the market is able to coordinate itself when a new equilibrium price and quantity is reached.  . 

Competition arises when more than one producer is trying to sell the same or similar products to the same buyers. In capitalist theory, competition leads to innovation and more affordable prices. Without competition, a monopoly or [[cartel]] may develop. A monopoly occurs when a firm supplies the total output in the market; the firm can therefore limit output and raise prices because it has no fear of competition. A cartel is a group of firms that act together in a monopolistic manner to control output and raise prices.  . 

===Role of government===. 
{{Further|Competition regulator|Consumer protection|Competition law}}
In a capitalist system, the government does not prohibit private property or prevent individuals from working where they please. The government does not prevent firms from determining what wages they will pay and what prices they will charge for their products. Many countries, however, have minimum wage laws and minimum safety standards.  . 

Under some versions of capitalism, the government carries out a number of economic functions, such as issuing money, supervising public utilities and enforcing private contracts. Many countries have [[competition law]]s that prohibit monopolies and cartels from forming. Despite anti-monopoly laws, large corporations can form near-monopolies in some industries. Such firms can temporarily drop prices and accept losses to prevent competition from entering the market, and then raise them again once the threat of entry is reduced. In many countries, public utilities (e.g. electricity, heating fuel, communications) are able to operate as a monopoly under government regulation, due to high economies of scale.  . 

Government agencies regulate the standards of service in many industries, such as airlines and broadcasting, as well as financing a wide range of programs. In addition, the government regulates the flow of capital and uses financial tools such as the interest rate to control factors such as inflation and unemployment. <ref>"Capitalism." World Book Encyclopedia. 1988. 194. Print. </ref> . 

==Democracy, the state, and legal frameworks==. 
{{Main|History of capitalist theory}} . 

===Private property===. 
The relationship between the [[state (polity)|state]], its formal mechanisms, and capitalist societies has been debated in many fields of social and political theory, with active discussion since the 19th century. [[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando de Soto]] is a contemporary economist who has argued that an important characteristic of capitalism is the functioning state protection of property rights in a formal property system where ownership and transactions are clearly recorded. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/03/desoto.htm |title=The mystery of capital|author=Hernando de Soto|accessdate=26 February 2008}}</ref> . 

According to de Soto, this is the process by which physical assets are transformed into capital, which in turn may be used in many more ways and much more efficiently in the market economy. A number of Marxian economists have argued that the [[Enclosure Acts]] in England, and similar legislation elsewhere, were an integral part of capitalist [[primitive accumulation]] and that specific legal frameworks of private land ownership have been integral to the development of capitalism. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch27.htm |title=Capital, v. 1.

===Institutions===. 
[[New institutional economics]], a field pioneered by [[Douglass North]], stresses the need of a legal framework in order for capitalism to function optimally, and focuses on the relationship between the historical development of capitalism and the creation and maintenance of political and economic institutions. <ref>{{Cite book|author=North, Douglass C.|title=Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1990}}</ref> In new institutional economics and other fields focusing on public policy, economists seek to judge when and whether governmental intervention (such as [[tax]]es, [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]], and [[Regulatory economics|government regulation]]) can result in potential gains in efficiency. According to [[Gregory Mankiw]], a [[New Keynesian economics|New Keynesian economist]], governmental intervention can improve on market outcomes under conditions of "[[market failure]]", or situations in which the market on its own does not allocate resources efficiently. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of Economics|publisher=Harvard University|year=1997|pages=10|issue=Gregory|unused_data=Mankiw,}}</ref> . 

Market failure occurs when an [[externality]] is present and a market will either under-produce a product with a positive externalization or overproduce a product that generates a negative externalization. Air pollution, for instance, is a negative externalization that cannot be incorporated into markets as the world’s air is not owned and then sold for use to polluters. So, too much pollution could be emitted and people not involved in the production pay the cost of the pollution instead of the firm that initially emitted the air pollution. Critics of market failure theory, like [[Ronald Coase]], [[Harold Demsetz]], and [[James M. Buchanan]] argue that government programs and policies also fall short of absolute perfection. Market failures are often small, and government failures are sometimes large. It is therefore the case that imperfect markets are often better than imperfect governmental alternatives. While all nations currently have some kind of market regulations, the desirable degree of regulation is disputed.  . 

===Democracy===. 
The relationship between [[democracy]] and capitalism is a contentious area in theory and popular political movements. The extension of universal adult male [[suffrage]] in 19th century Britain occurred along with the development of industrial capitalism, and democracy became widespread at the same time as capitalism, leading many theorists to posit a causal relationship between them, or that each affects the other. However, in the 20th century, according to some authors, capitalism also accompanied a variety of political formations quite distinct from liberal democracies, including [[fascism|fascist]] regimes, absolute monarchies, and single-party states. <ref name="Burnham" /> . 

While some thinkers argue that capitalist development more-or-less inevitably eventually leads to the emergence of democracy, others dispute this claim. Research on the [[democratic peace theory]] indicates that capitalist democracies rarely make war with one another<ref>For the influence of capitalism on peace, see Mousseau, M. (2009) "The Social Market Roots of Democratic Peace", ''International Security'' 33 (4)</ref> and have little internal violence. However critics of the democratic peace theory note that democratic capitalist states may fight infrequently and or never with other democratic capitalist states because of political similarity or stability rather than because they are democratic or capitalist.  . 

Some commentators argue that though economic growth under capitalism has led to democratization in the past, it may not do so in the future, as [[authoritarian]] regimes have been able to manage economic growth without making concessions to greater political freedom. <ref>{{Cite web|author=Mesquita, Bruce Bueno de|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20050901faessay84507/bruce-bueno-de-mesquita-george-w-downs/development-and-democracy.html|title=Development and Democracy|date=2005-09|accessdate=26 February 2008|publisher=Foreign Affairs}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|author=Single, Joseph T.|url=http://www10.nytimes.com/cfr/international/20040901facomment_v83n4_siegle-weinstein-halperin.html?_r=5&oref=slogin&oref=slogin&oref=slogin&oref=slogin|title=Why Democracies Excel|date=2004-09|accessdate=26 February 2008|publisher=[[New York Times]]}}</ref>
States that have highly capitalistic economic systems have thrived under authoritarian or oppressive political systems. Singapore, which maintains a highly open market economy and attracts lots of foreign investment, does not protect civil liberties such as freedom of speech and expression. The private (capitalist) sector in the People's Republic of China has grown exponentially and thrived since its inception, despite having an authoritarian government.  [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s rule in Chile led to economic growth by using authoritarian means to create a safe environment for investment and capitalism.  . 

In response to criticism of the system, some proponents of capitalism have argued that its advantages are supported by empirical research. [[Indices of Economic Freedom]] show a correlation between nations with more economic freedom (as defined by the indices) and higher scores on variables such as income and life expectancy, including the poor, in these nations.  . 

==Advocacy for capitalism==. 
===Economic growth===. 
[[File:Gdp chart.png|thumb|World's [[GDP]] per capita shows exponential growth since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. <ref>{{Cite book|title=The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective |author=Angus Maddison |publisher=[[OECD]] |location=Paris |year=2001 |isbn=92-64-18998-X}}</ref>]]
[[File:Prc1952-2005gdp.gif|thumb|Capitalism and the economy of the [[People's Republic of China]]]] . 

Many theorists and policymakers in predominantly capitalist nations have emphasized capitalism's ability to promote economic growth, as measured by [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP), [[capacity utilization]] or [[standard of living]]. This argument was central, for example, to Adam Smith's advocacy of letting a free market control production and price, and allocate resources. Many theorists have noted that this increase in global GDP over time coincides with the emergence of the modern world capitalist system. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/04-05/essay.cfm |title=The Industrial Revolution: Past and Future |author=Robert E. Lucas Jr. |work=Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis 2003 Annual Report |accessdate=26 February 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/TCEH/1998_Draft/World_GDP/Estimating_World_GDP.html |title=Estimating World GDP, One Million B.C. – Present |author=J. Bradford DeLong |accessdate=26 February 2008 }}</ref> . 

In years 1000–1820 world economy grew sixfold, 50 % per person. After capitalism had started to spread more widely, in years  1820–1998 world economy grew 50-fold, i.e., 9-fold per person. <ref name=wolf44/> In most capitalist economic regions such as Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the economy grew 19-fold per person even though these countries already had a higher starting level, and in Japan, which was poor in 1820, to 31-fold, whereas in the rest of the world the growth was only 5-fold per person. <ref name=wolf44>[[Martin Wolf]], ''[[Why Globalization works]]'', p. 43-45</ref> . 

Proponents argue that increasing GDP (per capita) is empirically shown to bring about improved standards of living, such as better availability of food, housing, clothing, and health care. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/IndustrialRevolutionandtheStandardofLiving.html |title=Industrial Revolution and the Standard of Living |first=Clark |last=Nardinelli |accessdate=26 February 2008 }}</ref> The decrease in the number of hours worked per week and the decreased participation of children and the elderly in the workforce have been attributed to capitalism. <ref>{{Cite book|author=Barro, Robert J.|title=Macroeconomics|publisher=MIT Press|year=1997|isbn=0262024365}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mises.org/article.aspx?Id=1481|title=Morality and Economic Law: Toward a Reconciliation|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|accessdate=26 February 2008|author=Woods, Thomas E.|date=5 April 2004}}</ref> . 

Proponents also believe that a capitalist economy offers far more opportunities for individuals to raise their income through new professions or business ventures than do other economic forms. To their thinking, this potential is much greater than in either traditional [[feudal]] or [[tribal]] societies or in socialist societies.  . 

===Political freedom===. 
Milton Friedman stated that the [[economic freedom]] of capitalism is a requisite of [[political freedom]] which has been continuously echoed by others such as Andrew Brennan and Ronald Reagan. Friedman stated that centralized operations of economic activity is always accompanied by [[political repression]]. In his view, transactions in a market economy are voluntary, and the wide diversity that voluntary activity permits is a fundamental threat to repressive political leaders and greatly diminish power to coerce. Friedman's view was also shared by [[Friedrich Hayek]] and John Maynard Keynes, both of whom believed that capitalism is vital for freedom to survive and thrive. <ref>{{Cite book|author=Friedrich Hayek|title=The Road to Serfdom|publisher=[[University Of Chicago Press]] |year=1944|isbn=0-226-32061-8}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author=Bellamy, Richard|title=The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Political Thought|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-521-56354-2|pages=60}}</ref> . 

===Self-organization===. 
Austrian School economists have argued that capitalism can organize itself into a complex system without an external guidance or central planning mechanism. Friedrich Hayek considered the phenomenon of [[self-organization]] as underpinning capitalism. Prices serve as a signal as to the urgent and unfilled wants of people, and the promise of profits gives entrepreneurs [[incentive]] to use their knowledge and resources to satisfy those wants. Thus the activities of millions of people, each seeking his own interest, are coordinated. <ref>{{Cite book|author=Walberg, Herbert|title=Education and Capitalism|publisher=Hoover Institution Press|year=2001|pages=87–89|isbn=0-8179-3972-5}}</ref> . 

==Criticisms==. 
{{Main|Criticism of capitalism}}
[[File:Anti-capitalism color.jpg|right|thumb|250px|An [[Industrial Workers of the World]] poster (1911)]] . 

Critics of capitalism associate it with: [[social inequality]] and unfair [[distribution of wealth]] and power; a tendency toward market monopoly or [[oligopoly]] (and government by [[oligarchy]]); [[imperialism]], [[counter-revolutionary]] wars and various forms of economic and cultural [[exploitation]]; repression of workers and trade unionists; [[social alienation]]; [[economic inequality]]; [[unemployment]]; and economic instability. Individual property rights have also been associated with the [[tragedy of the anticommons]].  . 

Notable critics of capitalism have included: [[socialism|socialists]], [[anarchism|anarchists]], [[communism|communists]], [[Nazism|national socialists]], [[Social democracy|social democrats]], [[Technocracy|technocrats]], some types of [[conservatism|conservatives]], [[Luddite]]s, [[Narodnik]]s, [[Shakers]] and some types of [[nationalism|nationalists]].  . 

[[Marxism|Marxists]] have advocated a revolutionary overthrow of capitalism that would lead to socialism, before eventually transforming into communism. Many socialists consider capitalism to be irrational, in that production and the direction of the economy are unplanned, creating many inconsistencies and internal contradictions. <ref>Brander, James A. Government policy toward business. 4th ed. Mississauga, Ontario: John Wiley & Sons Canada, Ltd., 2006. Print. </ref> [[Labor history (discipline)|Labor historians]] and scholars such as [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] have argued that [[Unfree labour|unfree labor]] — by [[Slavery|slaves]], [[indentured servant]]s, prisoners, and other coerced persons — is compatible with capitalist relations. <ref>That unfree labour is acceptable to capital was argued during the 1980s by Tom Brass. See ''Towards a Comparative Political Economy of Unfree Labor'' (Cass, 1999). {{Cite web|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/llt/52/linden.html |title="Labour History as the History of Multitudes", ''Labour/Le Travail'', 52, Fall 2003, p. 235-244 |author=Marcel van der Linden |accessdate=26 February 2008}}</ref> . 

Many aspects of capitalism have come under attack from the [[anti-globalization movement]], which is primarily opposed to [[corporate capitalism]]. [[environmentalism|Environmentalists]] have argued that capitalism requires continual economic growth, and that it will inevitably deplete the finite natural resources of the Earth. <ref>{{cite book |last = McMurty |first = John |title = The Cancer Stage of Capitalism |publisher = [[PLUTO PRESS]] |year = 1999 |isbn = 0745313477}}</ref> . 

Many religions have criticized or opposed specific elements of capitalism. Traditional [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and Islam forbid [[Usury|lending money at interest]], although alternative methods of banking have been developed. Some Christians have criticized capitalism for its [[Economic materialism|materialist]] aspects<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P8C.HTM#-2FX|title=III. The Social Doctrine of the Church|publisher=The Vatican|accessdate=26 February 2008}}</ref> and its inability to account for the wellbeing of all people. <ref>Thomas Gubleton, archbishop of Detroit speaking in "Capitalism: A love story"{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}</ref><ref>priest Peter Dougherty, speaking in "Capitalism: A love story"{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}</ref> .
