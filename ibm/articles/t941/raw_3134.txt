'''Abstinence, be faithful, use a condom''',  also known as the '''ABC strategy''' or '''abstinence-plus sex education''', also known as abstinence-based sex education, is a [[sex education]] policy based on [[harm reduction]] which modifies the approach of [[abstinence-only sex education]] by including education about [[safe sex]] and [[birth control]] methods. Abstinence-only sex education is strictly to promote the sexual abstinence until marriage, and does not teach about safe sex or contraceptives. The abstinence-based sex education program is meant to stress abstinence and include information on safe sex practices. In general terms, this strategy of sex education is a compromise between abstinence-only education and comprehensive sex education. The ABC approach was developed in response to the growing epidemic of [[HIV/AIDS in Africa]], and to prevent the spread of other [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.  . 

Abstinence-based sex education can include issues of human relationships, the basic biology of human reproduction, safe sex methods and contraceptives, [[HIV/AIDS]] information, and masturbation in place of sex. It recommends [[sexual abstinence]] outside marriage as an ideal, having only a single long-term sexual partner. The use of [[condom]]s and other safe sex practices is advocated only if it is not possible to remain with a single sexual partner. Advocating this ideal, whilst pragmatically dealing with the fact that abstinence only sex education is ineffective by itself, has made the ABC approach more palatable to many African governments and relief agencies. <ref>{{cite book |last=Niver |first=April Diana |title=Taking Sides: A Grounded Theory of Sex Educators’ Experiences and Perceptions of Conflict |type=PhD Thesis |publisher=Arizona State University |year=2007 |url=http://gradworks.umi.com/32/58/3258045.html |oclc=612065556}}{{pn|date=November 2011}}</ref>  . 

The ABC approach has notably been used in African countries like [[Uganda]]. <ref>{{cite web |title=The ABC of HIV prevention |publisher=[[AVERT]] |url=http://www.avert.org/abc-hiv.htm}}</ref> Its positive impact has been confirmed by a 2009 Stanford University survey. <ref>{{cite journal |first1=Eran |last1=Bendavid |first2=Jayanta |last2=Bhattacharya |title=The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief in Africa: An Evaluation of Outcomes |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |pmid=19349625 |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19349625 |laysummary=http://healthpolicy.stanford.edu/news/stanford_study_first_ever_to_show_us_aids_relief_program_saved_a_million_lives_20090406/ |laysource=[[Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies]] |laydate=April 6, 2009 |doi=10.1059/0003-4819-150-10-200905190-00117 |year=2009 |volume=150 |issue=10 |pages=688–95 |pmc=2892894}}</ref> . 

== Components ==. 
Abstinence, Be Faithful, Use a Condom consists of three components: . 

'''Abstinence''' -  The ABC approach encourages young adults to use abstinence until marriage, the most effective way to avoid HIV infection.  The program develops skills for practicing abstinence and encourages participants to adopt social norms that support abstinence. <ref name="state.gov defining abc">"Defining the ABC Approach." U.S. Department of State. 09 Apr. 2009 <nowiki>http://www.state.gov/s/gac/partners/guide/abc/56568.htm</nowiki>{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> . 

'''Be Faithful''' - In addition to abstinence, the ABC approach encourages participants to eliminate casual sex partners and to practice fidelity within their marriages and other sexual relationships.  This reduces exposure to HIV.  In Uganda between 1989–1995, [[Yoweri Museveni|President Museveni]] reported a 20% decline in casual sex partners, and an 11% decline in reported cases of HIV. <ref name="state.gov defining abc"/> . 

'''Use a Condom''' - The final component to the ABC approach is "correct and consistent condom use."  While understanding the benefits of abstinence, participants are instructed how to apply and use a condom.  This is an example of risk reduction during cases when risk elimination is not practiced.  Students are also taught that condoms do not protect against all forms of sexually transmitted diseases. <ref name="state.gov defining abc"/> . 

== Growth and popularity in the United States ==. 
Starting primarily in the [[1980s]] and [[1990s]], the popularity of the "abstinence plus" sex education program grew into a common method of teaching students, in the [[United States]], about sexuality. The program understood that it would not be possible to stop all teenagers from having sex, but still stressed that abstinence is the only guaranteed way of avoiding unwanted pregnancies and contraction of STDs. <ref>{{cite book |last=Ashbee |first=Edward |title=The Bush Administration, Sex and the Moral Agenda |location=New York |publisher=Manchester UP |year=2007 |pages=102–36 |isbn=978-0-7190-7277-2}}</ref> The most important message to teens from the program comes from [[Joycelyn Elders|Dr. Joycelyn Elders]], [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton's]] first [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]], that "if they have a baby there is an 80% likelihood they'll be poor, ignorant, and slaves for the rest of their lives."<ref>"Illegitimate rhetoric- Clinton administration's policies towards sex education", ''National Review'' (15 August 1994)</ref> In 1997 the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] established a "Girl Power!" campaign focusing on girls ages 9–14 which encouraged abstinence as a form of empowerment. <ref>''Secretary Shalala Launches Strategy to Prevent Teen Pregnancy; New State-by-State Data Show Declines in Teen Birth Rates''(6 January 1997), <nowiki>http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/1997pres/970106.html</nowiki>{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> For those who would reject abstinence, though, abstinence-only messages provided little to no hope to prevent pregnancy and spread of disease. To account for this, some states included information about contraceptives in their sex education programs along with encouragement for students to be abstinent. Of the states that, in 1995, required abstinence education, fourteen also included the use of contraception within the curriculum. <ref>{{cite journal |pages=327–39 |doi=10.1016/S0190-7409(97)00021-2 |title=Sex Education and Abstinence: Programs and Evaluation |year=1997 |last1=Besharov |first1=Douglas J. |last2=Gardiner |first2=Karen N. |journal=Children and Youth Services Review |volume=19 |issue=5–6}}</ref>     . 

In September 1995, [[Hawaii]] passed the Abstinence-Based Education Policy. (Policy # 2110). It is meant to support abstinence and help develop skills to continue abstinence, help teens who have had sexual intercourse to abstain from further, and to proved teens with information on contraceptives and methods for preventing sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. <ref>http://lilinote.k12.hi.us/STATE/BOE/POL1.NSF/85255a0a0010ae82852555340060479d/1bb88fd5ec2ea5940a2566a3000110ef?OpenDocument{{full}}</ref> . 

HIV/AIDS is one of the leading causes of deaths in the United States and 1 in 300 people are living with HIV/AIDS. Around one million people have HIV/AIDS in the United States. More than 524,000 people in the United States have died of HIV/AIDS. Around 40,000 people are infected each year. <ref><nowiki>http://projects.psi.org/site/PageServer?pagename=Statistics_nr&gclid=CPzf7biOu5kCFRBbagodNmG54w</nowiki>{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> . 

== Criticisms == . 

The usefulness of the ABC concept is highly debated. The three elements are interpreted differently by different actors and critics argue that often abstinence and faithfulness is unduly promoted over condoms and other measures such as education, female empowerment and making available modern antiviral drugs. <ref name=Barnett>{{cite journal |pages=590–3 |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(05)70219-X |title=HIV/AIDS: Sex, abstinence, and behaviour change |year=2005 |last1=Barnett |first1=Tony |last2=Parkhurst |first2=Justin |journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases |volume=5 |issue=9 |pmid=16122682}}</ref> For example, the [[United States|U.S.]] [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] has been criticised for prioritising "A" and "B" over "C" within its funding criteria. "C" activities may only be directed at "high-risk" groups, and not to the general population. <ref>United States Government Accountability Office, 2006; Cohen J. Tate T. 2005.{{full}}</ref> . 

===Liberal critics===. 
Critics argue that in many countries women are frequently infected by their unfaithful husbands while being faithfully married, and thus women who follow the recommendations of ABC promoters face an increased risk of HIV infection. <ref name=Sinding>{{cite journal |first1=Steven W. |last1=Sinding |title=Does 'CNN' (Condoms, Needles, Negotiation) Work Better than 'ABC' (Abstinence, Being Faithful and Condom Use) in Attacking the AIDS Epidemic? |journal=International Family Planning Perspectives |jstor=3649501 |pmid=15888408 |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3103805.html |pages=38–40 |volume=31 |issue=1 |year=2005 |doi=10.1363/ifpp.31.38.05}}</ref> [[Condoms, needles, and negotiation]] is a proposed alternative approach  as is ''SAVE'' (Safer practices, Available medication, Voluntary testing & counselling and Empowerment through education). <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anerela.org/prevention-model.html{{full}} |title=de beste bron van informatie over anerela. Deze website is te koop! |publisher=anerela.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04}}</ref> . 

Critics furthermore allege that the strategy overlooks the epidemic's social, political, and economic causes and "vulnerable populations", e.g. [[sex worker]]s and "those who lack the ability to negotiate safe sex" as well as risk groups such as [[homosexual]]s and [[intravenous drug user]]s. <ref name=Murphy>{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030379 |title=Was the "ABC" Approach (Abstinence, Being Faithful, Using Condoms) Responsible for Uganda's Decline in HIV? |year=2006 |last1=Murphy |first1=Elaine M. |last2=Greene |first2=Margaret E. |last3=Mihailovic |first3=Alexandra |last4=Olupot-Olupot |first4=Peter |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=e379 |pmid=17002505 |pmc=1564179}}</ref> . 

Critics also argue that using the word "abstinence," then teaching about safe sex and contraceptives, can be contradictory. <ref name="HRW">{{cite journal |first1=Jonathan |last1=Cohen |first2=Tony |last2=Tate |title=The Less They Know, the Better: Abstinence-Only HIV/AIDS Programs in Uganda |journal=Reproductive Health Matters |jstor=25475267 |pmid=18446994 |url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/2005/uganda0305/index.htm |pages=174–178 |volume=14 |issue=28 |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/S0968-8080(06)28249-1}}</ref> . 

===Conservative critics===. 
[[Pope]] [[Benedict XVI]] has criticised some harm reduction policies with regards to HIV/AIDS, saying that "if the soul is lacking, if Africans do not help one another, the scourge [of HIV] cannot be resolved by distributing condoms; quite the contrary, we risk worsening the problem". <ref><nowiki>http://www.harvardaidsprp.org/newsletter/april2009.html</nowiki>{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> Whilst this position has been widely denounced for misrepresenting and oversimplifying the role of condoms in preventing infections,<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Yankee |last1=Doodling |title=The papal position on condoms and HIV |journal=BMJ |pmid=19321547 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19321547 |doi=10.1136/bmj.b1217 |year=2009 |volume=338 |pages=b1217}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.b1206 |title=Pope claims that condoms exacerbate HIV and AIDS problem |year=2009 |last1=Roehr |first1=B. |journal=BMJ |volume=338 |pages=b1206 |pmid=19321545}}</ref> there has been expert scientific opinion and evidence supporting it. <ref>{{cite news |title=The Pope May Be Right |first=Edward C. |last=Green |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/27/AR2009032702825.html |work=The Washington Post}}</ref> . 

Archbishop Gabriel Charles Palmer-Buckle of Accra has stated that "the Catholic Church [offers] three methods to help solve this problem of AIDS in Africa: "A", abstain; "B", be faithful; "C", chastity, which is in consonance with traditional African values. Those [[Planned Parenthood]] people are only talking about condoms. By the way, they know full well that the condoms devoted to Africa are sub-standard."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://ncronline.org/news/vatican/ghanaian-archbishop-says-church-has-failed-africa |title=Ghanaian archbishop says church has failed Africa |date=October 14, 2009 |first=John L. |last=Allen |work=National Catholic Reporter}}</ref> There is no reliable source that condoms in Africa are inferior. <ref>{{cite journal |pmid=12294480 |year=1999 |title=South Africa plays down faulty condom scare |pages=10–1 |journal=AIDS weekly plus}}</ref> .
