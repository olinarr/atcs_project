'''Adolescent sexuality''' refers to sexual feelings, behavior and development in [[adolescence|adolescents]] and is a stage of [[human sexuality]]. Sexuality is often a vital aspect of teenagers' lives. <ref name="sex lives2">{{cite book | title=The Sex Lives of Teenagers| last=Ponton| first=Lynn| year=2000| isbn=0-452-28260-8|publisher=Dutton| location=New York| page=2}}</ref> The sexual behavior of adolescents is, in most cases, influenced by their culture's [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] and [[mores]], their [[sexual orientation]], and the issues of [[social control]] such as [[age of consent]] laws.  . 

In humans, mature sexual desire usually begins to appear with the onset of [[puberty]]. Sexual expression can take the form of [[masturbation]] or sex with a partner. Sexual interests among adolescents, as among adults, can vary greatly. Sexual activity in general is associated with various risks including unwanted [[pregnancy]] and [[sexually transmitted disease]]s including [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]. The risks are elevated for young adolescents because their brains are not neurally mature; several brain regions in the frontal lobe of the cerebral cortex and in the [[hypothalamus]] important for self control, delayed gratification, and risk analysis and appreciation are not fully mature. The creases in the brain continue to become more complex until the late teens, and the brain is not fully mature until age 25. <ref name="Casey, B. J. 2008">Casey, B. J., Getz, S., & Galvan, A. (2008). The adolescent brain.

In 2002, an international survey was conducted, with the aim of studying the prevalence of sexual intercourse in adolescents. The researchers surveyed 33,943 students aged 15, from 24 countries, completed a self-administered, anonymous, classroom survey, consisting of a standard questionnaire, developed by the HBSC (Health Behaviour in School- aged Children) international research network. The survey revealed that the majority of the students were still virgins (they had no experience of sexual intercourse), and, among those who were sexually active, the majority (82%) used contraception. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Godeau E, Nic Gabhainn S, Vignes C, Ross J, Boyce W, Todd J |title=Contraceptive use by 15-year-old students at their last sexual intercourse: results from 24 countries |journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med |volume=162 |issue=1 |pages=66–73 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18180415 |doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2007.8 |url=http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18180415}}</ref> .

====Prevalence of sexual activity==== . 

According to the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], in 2007 47.8% of U.S. high school students reported having ever had sexual intercourse. This number has shown a downward trend since 1991, when the figure was 54.1%. <ref name="YRBS">{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/HealthyYouth/yrbs/pdf/yrbs07_us_sexual_behaviors_trend.pdf |title=Trends in the Prevalence of Sexual Behaviors|accessdate=2008-07-02 |work=The National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) 1991-2007 |publisher=US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |year=2007 |format=PDF}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> According to a survey commissioned by NBC News and [[People (magazine)|''People'' magazine]], 87% of 13- to 16-year-olds report having never had sexual intercourse, and 73% report having not been sexually intimate at all. Three quarters of these respondents say they have not because they feel they are too young, and just as many say they have made a conscious decision not to. <ref name="Couric">{{Cite web| url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6839072|title=Nearly 3 in 10 young teens 'sexually active'|accessdate=2007-01-21|publisher=MSNBC|year=2005|author=Katie Couric| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070120012452/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6839072| archivedate= 20 January 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> . 

Increasing rates of [[oral sex]] among teens have been reported. However a study released in 2008 by the Guttmacher Institute found that, while oral sex is slightly more common than vaginal sex among teens, the prevalence of oral sex among teen opposite-sex partners has held steady for the last decade. <ref name="Guttmacher_oralsex">{{cite web |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/JAH_Lindberg.pdf |title=Non-coital sexual activities among adolescents |accessdate=2008-06-30 |last=Duberstein Lindberg | first=Laura | coauthors=Rachel Jones, John S. Santelli |publisher=Guttmacher Institute|format=PDF}}</ref> According to the study, slightly more than half (55%) of 15– to 19-year-olds have engaged in heterosexual oral sex, 50% have engaged in vaginal sex and 11% have had anal sex.  . 

The CDC also tracks the percentage of students who say they used drugs or alcohol before sex.  While this risk behavior increased between 1991 and 2001, the trend has been declining since then. <ref name="YRBS"/> In 2007, 22.5% of high school students reported this risk behavior, down from 25.6% in 2001. <ref name="YRBS"/> . 

The same survey found while only 27% of 13- to 16-year-olds had been involved in intimate or sexual activity, 8% had had a casual sexual relationship,<ref name="Couric"/> which has been described by one journalist as a "profound shift in the culture of high school dating and sex". <ref name="boston">{{cite journal | author=Alexandra Hall| title=The Mating Habits of the Suburban High School Teenager| journal=Boston Magazine| issue=May 2003| url=http://www.bostonmagazine.com/articles/the_mating_habits_of_the_suburban_high_school_teenager/}}</ref> In his book, ''Why Gender Matters'', researcher Leonard Sax states that teenage sexual encounters are increasingly taking place outside the context of romantic relationships, in purely sexual "[[Casual sex|hookups]]". <ref name="sax132">{{cite book | title=Why Gender Matters| url=http://www.whygendermatters.com| last=Sax, M.D., Ph.D| first=Leonard| year=2005| publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]| isbn = 0-385-51073-X| page=132}}</ref> . 

In 2002, the [[National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health]] reported a "dramatic trend toward the early initiation of sex". <ref>{{cite journal |author=Sieving RE, Oliphant JA, Blum RW |title=Adolescent sexual behavior and sexual health |journal=Pediatr Rev |volume=23 |issue=12 |pages=407–16 |year=2002 |month=December |pmid=12456893 }}</ref> According to the American Academy of Pediatrics "early sexual intercourse among American adolescents represents a major public health problem. Although early sexual activity may be caused by a variety of factors, the media are believed to play a significant role. U.S. teens rank the media second only to school sex education programs as a leading source of information about sex". <ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Sexuality, contraception, and the media.

====Adolescent Pregnancy==== . 

The U.S. teen pregnancy rate is higher than in many other developed countries. <ref name="Guttmacher_factsheet">{{cite web |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_ATSRH.html |title=Facts on American Teens' Sexual and Reproductive Health |accessdate=2008-07-02 |work= |publisher=Guttmacher Institute |year=2006 |month=September }}</ref> After declining steadily since 1991, the teen pregnancy rate rose 3% in 2006, to 41.9 births per 1,000. This followed a 14-year downward trend in which the teen birth rate fell by 34% from its 1991 peak of 61.8 births per 1,000. <ref>{{cite press release |title=Teen Birth Rate Rises for First Time in 15 Years |publisher=National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=2007-12-05 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/07newsreleases/teenbirth.htm |accessdate=2008-07-02| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080615060040/http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/PRESSROOM/07newsreleases/teenbirth.htm| archivedate= 15 June 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
====Contraception and protection==== . 

Among sexually active 15- to 19-year-olds, 83% of females and 91% of males reported using at least one method of birth control during last intercourse. <ref name="KFF_factsheet">{{cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/womenshealth/upload/3040-03.pdf |title=Sexual Health Statistics for Teenagers and Young Adults in the United States |accessdate=2008-07-02 |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |year=2006| month=September |format=PDF }}</ref> The most common methods of contraception are condoms and birth control pills. In 2007, 61.5% of high school students reported using a condom the last time they had sexual intercourse, up from 46% in 1991. <ref name="YRBS"/> . 

In the U.S., 431 schools in fifty districts (0.35% of all districts and 2.2% of all high schools nationwide) have established school-based condom availability programs.  These programs involve condom distribution, condom-use education and information, peer support, sex and STDs education within the curriculum, and involvement of parents, staff, partnerships, and health care providers.  Studies have shown that condom availability programs in high schools may lower the risk of HIV, STDs, and teen pregnancy.  In all schools, condom use increased while sexual behaviour remained the same among high school students following the implementation of condom availability programs. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Furstenberg FF, Geitz LM, Teitler JO, Weiss CC |title=Does condom availability make a difference?

====Sexually transmitted infections==== . 

Public health officials express concerns that [[sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs) and risky behaviors that include "anything but intercourse" are "rampant" among teens. <ref name="risky">{{cite journal | author=Anna Mulrine| title=Risky Business| url=http://www.guttmacher.org/media/pdf/news2002/0528_clip.pdf | journal=U.S. News & World Report| issue=May 27, 2002|format=PDF}}</ref> Of the 18.9 million new cases of STIs each year, 9.1 million (48%) occur among 15- to 24-year-olds, even though this age group represents only one-quarter of the sexually active population. <ref name="Guttmacher_factsheet"/> According to a 2008 study by the  [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], an estimated 1 in 4 teen girls has at least one STI at any given time. <ref>{{cite press release |title=Nationally Representative CDC Study Finds 1 in 4 Teenage Girls Has a Sexually Transmitted Disease |publisher=US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=2008-03-11 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/STDConference/2008/media/release-11march2008.htm |accessdate=2008-07-03 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080608023928/http://www.cdc.gov/STDConference/2008/media/release-11march2008.htm| archivedate= 8 June 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
====Sources of Information for adolescents about sexuality==== . 

Most teenagers (70%) reported that they received some or a lot of information about sex and sexual relationships from their parents. Other sources of information included friends at 53%, school, also at 53%, TV and movies at 51% and magazines at 34%. School and magazines were said to be used as sources of information more by girls than by boys, and sexually active teens were more likely to cite their friends and partners as information sources. <ref name="Couric"/>
====Historical perspectives on sexuality and sexual health==== . 

Changes in the expression of adolescent sexuality in the United States find their origins in the [[sexual revolution]] and was the focus of the "[[culture wars]]". The U.S. federal government policy under [[George W. Bush]] emphasized [[sexual abstinence]] or [[chastity]], particularly in [[sex education]] with a focus on [[abstinence-only sex education]] rather than the [[harm reduction]] approach of the [[safe sex]] focus. It extended this approach to foreign policy, using the threat to withdraw foreign aid to press [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]'s into ending condom education and distribution in [[third-world]] countries. There is ongoing debate between those advocating comprehensive, medically accurate sex education and those who regard only abstinence-based education as accord "the values held by most Americans". <ref name="risky"/> . 

== Media influence == . 

Modern media contains more sexual messages than was true in the past and the effects on teen sexual behavior remain relatively unknown. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Brown JD |title=Mass media influences on sexuality |journal=J Sex Res |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=42–5 |year=2002 |month=February |pmid=12476255 |doi=10.1080/00224490209552118 }}</ref> Only 9% of the sex scenes on 1,300 of cable network programming discusses and deals with the negative consequences of sexual behavior. <ref>Pawlowski,Cheryl.,PH d.

===In Britain===. 
{{See also|Teenage pregnancy and sexual health in the United Kingdom}} . 

In 2006, a survey conducted by [[The Observer]] showed that most adolescents in Britain were waiting longer to have sexual intercourse than they were only a few years earlier. In 2002, 32% of teens were having sex before the age of 16; in 2006 it was only 20%. The average age a teen lost his/her virginity was 17.13 years in 2002; in 2006, it was 17.44 years on average for girls and 18.06 for boys. The most notable drop among teens who reported having sex was 14- and 15-year-olds. <ref name="British">{{cite journal | author=Denis Campbell| title=No sex please until we're at least 17 years old, we're British| journal=The Observer| date=January 22, 2006}}</ref> . 

A 2008 survey conducted by [[YouGov]] for [[Channel 4]] showed that 40% of all 14- to 17-year-olds are sexually active, 74% of sexually active 14- to 17-year-olds have had a sexual experience under the age of consent, and 6% of teens would wait until marriage before having sex. <ref name="sex stats">{{Cite web|url=http://sexperienceuk.channel4.com/teen-sex-survey|title=Teen Sex Survey|accessdate=2008-09-11|publisher=Channel 4|year=2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080912225248/http://sexperienceuk.channel4.com/teen-sex-survey| archivedate= 12 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> .

===In Canada===. 
One group of Canadian researchers found a relationship between self esteem and sexual activity. They found that students, especially girls, who were verbally abused by teachers or rejected by their peers were more likely than other students to have sex by the end of the Grade 7. The researchers speculate that low self esteem increases the likelihood of sexual activity: "low self-esteem seemed to explain the link between peer rejection and early sex. Girls with a poor self-image may see sex as a way to become 'popular', according to the researchers". <ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_55689.html Peer rejection tied to early sex in pre-teens]</ref> . 

===In India===. 
In [[India]] there is growing evidence that adolescents are becoming more sexually active outside of marriage. It is feared that this will lead to an increase in spread of [[AIDS|HIV/AIDS]] among adolescents, increase the number of unwanted pregnancies and [[abortion]]s, and give rise to conflict between contemporary social values. Adolescents have relatively poor access to health care and education. With cultural norms opposing extramarital sexual behavior "these implications may acquire threatening dimensions for the society and the nation". <ref name="india girls">{{Cite web|url=http://iussp2005.princeton.edu/download.aspx?submissionId=50332|title=Socio-psychological Constructs of Premarital Sex Behavior among Adolescent Girls in India|accessdate=2007-01-21|publisher=Princeton University|author=R.S.Goya, Indian Institute of Health Management Research, Jaipur, India|work=Abstract|format=pdf}}</ref> . 

;Motivation and frequency:
Sexual relationships outside marriage are not uncommon among teenage boys and girls in India. By far, the best predictor of whether or not a girl would be having sex is if her friends were engaging in the same activities. For those girls whose friends were having a physical relationship with a boy, 84.4% were engaging in the same behavior. Only 24.8% of girls whose friends were not having a physical relationship had one themselves. In urban areas, 25.2% of girls have had intercourse and in rural areas 20.9% have.  Better indicators of whether or not girls were having sex were their employment and school status.  Girls who were not attending school were 14.2% (17.4% v. 31.6%) more likely and girls who were employed were 14.4%(36.0% v. 21.6%) more likely to be having sex. <ref name="india girls">{{Cite web|url=http://iussp2005.princeton.edu/download.aspx?submissionId=50332|title=Socio-psychological Constructs of Premarital Sex Behavior among Adolescent Girls in India|accessdate=2007-01-21|publisher=Princeton University|author=R.S.Goya, Indian Institute of Health Management Research, Jaipur, India|work=Abstract|format=PDF}}</ref> . 

In the Indian sociocultural milieu girls have less access to parental love, schools, opportunities for self development and freedom of movement than boys do. It has been argued that they may rebel against this lack of access or seek out affection through physical relationships with boys.  While the data reflects trends to support this theory, it is inconclusive. <ref name="india girls" />  The freedom to communicate with adolescent boys was restricted for girls regardless of whether they lived in an urban or rural setting, and regardless of whether they went to school or not.  More urban girls than rural girls discussed sex with their friends.  Those who did not may have felt "the subject of sexuality in itself is considered an 'adult issue' and a taboo or it may be that some respondents were wary of revealing such personal information."<ref name="india know">{{cite journal | author=Dhoundiyal Manju & Venkatesh Renuka| title=Knowledge regarding human sexuality among adolescent girls| journal=The Indian Journal of Pediatrics| year=2006| volume=73| issue=8| url=http://www.ijppediatricsindia.org/article.asp?issn=0019-5456;year=2006;volume=73;issue=8;spage=743;epage=743;aulast=Dhoundiyal| pages=743| doi=10.1007/BF02898460 |pmid=16936373}}</ref> . 

;Contraceptive use:
Among Indian girls, "misconceptions about sex, sexuality and sexual health were large. However, adolescents having sex relationships were somewhat better informed about the sources of spread of STDs and HIV/AIDS."<ref name="india girls" />  While 40.0% of sexually active girls were aware that condoms could help prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS and reduce the likelihood of pregnancy, only 10.5% used a condom during the last time they had intercourse. <ref name="india girls" /> . 

==Teenage pregnancy==. 
{{Main|Teenage pregnancy}} . 

Adolescent girls become fertile following the [[menarche]] (first menstrual period), which occurs in the United States at an average age of 12.5, although it can vary widely between different girls. After menarche, [[sexual intercourse]] (especially without [[contraception]]) can lead to [[pregnancy]]. The pregnant teenager may then [[miscarriage|miscarry]], have an [[abortion]], or carry the child to [[birth|full term]].  . 

Pregnant teenagers face many of the same [[obstetrics]] issues as women in their 20s and 30s. However, there are additional medical concerns for younger mothers, particularly those under 15 and those living in developing countries; for example, [[obstetric fistula]] is a particular issue for very young mothers in poorer regions. <ref name="savethechildren">[http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/328/7449/1152-a Pregnancy and childbirth are leading causes of death in teenage girls in developing countries]</ref> For mothers between 15 and 19, risks are associated more with socioeconomic factors than with the biological effects of age. <ref name=makinson>{{cite journal |author=Makinson C |title=The health consequences of teenage fertility |journal=Fam Plann Perspect |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=132–9 |year=1985 |pmid=2431924 |doi=10.2307/2135024 |jstor=2135024 }}</ref> However, research has shown that the risk of [[low birth weight]] is connected to the biological age itself, as it was observed in teen births even after controlling for other risk factors (such as utilisation of antenatal care etc.). <ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/01443610410001685529 |title=Poor obstetric performance of teenagers: is it age- or quality of care-related?|year=2004|last1=Loto|first1=OM|last2=Ezechi|first2=OC|last3=Kalu|first3=BKE|last4=Loto|first4=Anthonia B|last5=Ezechi|first5=Lilian O|last6=Ogunniyi|first6=SO|journal=Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology|volume=24|issue=4|pages=395}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmid=17214178|year=1995|last1=Abalkhail|first1=BA|title=Adolescent pregnancy: Are there biological barriers for pregnancy outcomes?|volume=70|issue=5–6|pages=609–25|journal=The Journal of the Egyptian Public Health Association }}</ref> .

==Legal aspects of adolescent sexual activity==. 
[[File:Age of Consent - Global.svg|thumb|300 px|Age of Consent - Global]]
{{Main|Age of consent|Marriageable age}} {{See also|Teen marriage}} [[Statutory rape|Sexual conduct between adults and adolescents younger than the local age of consent]] is illegal, and in some [[Islam|Islamic]] countries any kind of sexual activity outside marriage is prohibited. In many jurisdictions, sexual intercourse between adolescents with a close age difference is not prohibited. Around the world, the average age-of-consent is 16,<ref>http://www.avert.org/age-of-consent.htm</ref> but this varies from being age 13 in [[Spain]], age 16 across [[Canada]], and age 16-18 in the [[United States]].  In some jurisdictions, the age-of-consent for homosexual acts may be different from that for heterosexual acts. The age-of-consent in a particular jurisdiction is typically the same as the [[age of majority]] or several years younger. The age at which one can legally marry is also sometimes different from the legal age-of-consent.  . 

Sexual relations with a person under the age-of-consent are generally a [[criminal offense]] in the jurisdiction in which the crime was committed, with punishments ranging from token fines to life imprisonment. Many different terms exist for the charges laid and include [[statutory rape]], illegal [[carnal knowledge]], or corruption of a minor. In some cases, sexual activity with someone above the legal age-of-consent but beneath the age of majority can be punishable under laws against contributing to the [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquency]] of a [[minor (law)|minor]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} . 

==Sex education==. 
'''[[Sex education]]''', also called "Sexuality Education" or informally "Sex Ed" is a broad term used to describe [[education]] about human [[sex organ|sexual anatomy]], [[sexual reproduction]], [[sexual intercourse]], [[human sexual behavior]], and other aspects of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], such as [[body image]], [[sexual orientation]], [[Dating (activity)|dating]], and [[Intimate relationship|relationships]]. Common avenues for sex education are parents, caregivers, friends, school programs, religious groups, popular media, and public health campaigns.  . 

Sexual education in different countries varies. For example, in [[France]] sex education has been part of school curricula since 1973. Schools are expected to provide 30 to 40 hours of sex education, and pass out condoms to students in grades eight and nine. In January, 2000, the French government launched an information campaign on contraception with TV and radio spots and the distribution of five million leaflets on contraception to high school students. <ref name=" britsexed ">[http://www.unesco.org/courier/2000_07/uk/apprend.htm Britain: Sex Education Under Fire] ''UNESCO Courier''</ref> . 

In [[Germany]], sex education has been part of school curricula since 1970. Since 1992 sex education is by law a governmental duty. <ref>[http://bildungsklick.de/pm/35091/sexualaufklaerung-in-europa/ Sexualaufklärung in Europa] (German)</ref> A survey by the [[World Health Organization]] concerning the habits of European teenagers in 2006 revealed that German teenagers care about contraception. The birth rate among 15 to 19-year-olds is 11.7 per 1000 population, compared to 2.9 per 1000 population in Korea, and 55.6 per 1000 population in US. <ref>http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/repcard3e.pdf</ref> . 

According to [[SIECUS]], the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, in most families, parents are the primary sex educators of their adolescents. They found 93% of adults they surveyed support sexuality education in high school and 84%  support it in junior high school. <ref>SIECUS Report of Public Support of Sexuality Education(1999)[http://www.siecus.org/school/sex_ed/sex_ed0002.html SIECUS Report Online]</ref> In fact, 88% of parents of junior high school students and 80% of parents of high school students believe that sex education in school makes it easier for them to talk to their adolescents about sex. <ref>Sex Education in America.(Washington, DC: National Public Radio, Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, and Kennedy School of Government, 2004), p. 5. </ref> Also, 92% of adolescents report that they want both to talk to their parents about sex and to have comprehensive in-school sex education.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} . 

Almost all U.S. students receive some form of sex education at least once between grades 7 and 12; many schools begin addressing some topics as early as grade 5 or 6. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Landry DJ, Singh S, Darroch JE |title=Sexuality education in fifth and sixth grades in U.S. public schools, 1999 |journal=Fam Plann Perspect |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=212–9 |year=2000 |pmid=11030258 |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3221200.html |doi=10.2307/2648174}}</ref>  However, what students learn varies widely, because curriculum decisions are quite decentralized. <ref name="Kaiser 2002">{{cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/youthhivstds/upload/Sex-Education-in-the-U-S-Policy-and-Politics.pdf |title=Sex Education in the U.S.: Policy and Politics |accessdate = 2007-05-23 |year=2002 |month=October |format=PDF |work=Issue Update |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation }}</ref> Two main forms of sex education are taught in American schools: comprehensive and  [[Abstinence-only sex education|abstinence-only]].

In Asia the state of sex education programs are at various stages of development. [[Indonesia]], [[Mongolia]], [[South Korea]] and [[Sri Lanka]] have a systematic policy framework for teaching about sex within schools. [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Thailand]] have assessed adolescent reproductive health needs with a view to developing adolescent-specific training, messages and materials. [[India]] has programs that specifically aim at school children at the age group of nine to sixteen years. These are included as subjects in the curriculum and generally involved open and frank interaction with the teachers. [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]] and [[Pakistan]] have no coordinated sex education programs. <ref name="escap">[http://www.unescap.org/esid/psis/population/icpd/sec7.asp Adolescents In Changing Times: Issues And Perspectives For Adolescent Reproductive Health In The ESCAP Region] United Nations Social and Economic Commission for Asia and the Pacific</ref> .
