'''Teenage pregnancy''' refers to [[pregnancy]] in a female under the age of 20 (when the pregnancy ends). A pregnancy can take place at any time before or after [[puberty]], with [[menarche]] (first menstrual period) normally taking place around the ages 12 or 13, and being the stage at which a female becomes potentially [[fertile]]. Teenage pregnancy depends on a number of societal and personal factors. Teenage pregnancy rates vary between countries because of differences in levels of sexual activity, general sex education provided and access to affordable contraceptive options. Worldwide, teenage pregnancy rates range from 143 per 1000 in some sub-Saharan African countries to 2.9 per 1000 in South Korea. <ref name=ncbi>{{cite journal |author=Treffers PE |title=[Teenage pregnancy, a worldwide problem] |language=Dutch; Flemish |journal=Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd |volume=147 |issue=47 |pages=2320–5 |year=2003 |pmid=14669537 }}</ref><ref name=oecd>UNICEF.

In [[developed country|developed countries]], teenage pregnancies are associated with many [[social issues]], including lower [[education]]al levels, higher rates of [[poverty]], and other poorer life outcomes in children of teenage mothers.

Care must also be taken of the common actual marriage age in different countries, as in countries where teenage marriages are common can expect to also experience higher levels of teenage pregnancies. 
In an attempt to reverse the increasing numbers of teenage pregnancies, governments in many Western countries have instituted [[sex education]] programs, the main objective of which is to reduce such pregnancies and STD's.  . 

[[Save the Children]] found that, annually, 13 million children are born to women under age 20 worldwide, more than 90% in developing countries. [[Complications of pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]] are the leading cause of [[death|mortality]] among women between the ages of 15 and 19 in such areas. <ref name=savethechildren/> The highest rate of teenage pregnancy in the world is in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], where women tend to marry at an early age. <ref name=ncbi/> In [[Niger]], for example, 87% of women surveyed were married and 53% had given birth to a child before the age of 18. <ref name=subsahara>Locoh, Therese.

In the [[Indian subcontinent]], early [[marriage]] sometimes means adolescent pregnancy, particularly in [[rural]] regions where the rate is much higher than it is in [[urbanization|urbanized]] areas. The rate of early marriage and pregnancy has decreased sharply in [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]], although it remains relatively high in the former. In the industrialized Asian nations such as [[South Korea]] and [[Singapore]], teenage birth rates are among the lowest in the world. <ref name=escap>Mehta, Suman, Groenen, Riet and Roque, Francisco.

The overall trend in [[Europe]] since 1970 has been a decreasing [[total fertility rate]], an increase in the age at which women experience their first birth, and a decrease in the number of births among teenagers. Most continental [[Western European]] countries have very low teenage birth rates. This is varyingly attributed to good [[sex education]] and high levels of [[contraceptive]] use (in the case of the [[Netherlands]] and [[Scandinavia]]), [[traditional values]] and [[social stigma]]tization (in the case of [[Spain]] and [[Italy]]) or both (in the case of [[Switzerland]]). <ref name=oecd/> . 

The teenage birth rate in the [[United States]] is the highest in the developed world, and the teenage abortion rate is also high. <ref name=oecd/> The U.S. teenage pregnancy rate was at a high in the 1950s and has decreased since then, although there has been an increase in births out of wedlock. <ref>[http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/tgr/05/1/gr050107.html guttmacher.org]. guttmacher.org (2002-02-01).

| quote = Pregnancies are the sum of births, abortions and miscarriages. Please note that in these tables, “age” refers to the woman’s age when the pregnancy ended. Consequently, actual numbers of pregnancies that occurred among teenagers are higher than those reported here, because most of the women who conceived at age 19 had their births or abortions after they turned 20 and, thus, were not counted as teenagers.}}</ref>  Consequently, the statistics do not include women who became pregnant at least shortly before their 20th birthdays, but who gave birth, experienced a [[miscarriage]], or had a voluntary [[abortion]] on or after their 20th birthdays. <ref name=Kost />  Similarly, statistics on the mother's marital status are determined by whether she is married at the end of the pregnancy, not at the time of conception.  . 

==Impact==. 
===Medical===. 
Maternal and [[prenatal]] health is of particular concern among teens who are pregnant or parenting. The worldwide incidence of [[premature birth]] and [[birth weight|low birth weight]] is higher among adolescent mothers. <ref name=makinson/><ref name=natcamp/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Scholl TO, Hediger ML, Belsky DH |title=Prenatal care and maternal health during adolescent pregnancy: a review and meta-analysis |journal=J Adolesc Health |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=444–56 |year=1994 |pmid=7811676 |doi=10.1016/1054-139X(94)90491-K }}</ref>  In a rural hospital in West Bengal, teenage mothers between 15–19 years old were more likely to have anemia, preterm delivery, and low birth weight than mothers between 20–24 years old. <ref>{{cite journal |last=Banerjee |first=B. |last2=Pandey |first2=G. |last3=Dutt |first3=D. |last4=Sengupta |first4=B. |last5=Mondal |first5=M. |last6=Deb |first6=S. |year=2009 |title=Teenage Pregnancy: A Socially Inflicted Health Hazard |journal=Indian Journal of Community Medicine |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=227–231 |doi=10.4103/0970-0218.55289 |pmid=20049301 |pmc=2800903 }}</ref> . 

Research indicates that pregnant teens are less likely to receive [[prenatal care]], often seeking it in the [[third trimester]], if at all. <ref name=makinson/> The Guttmacher Institute reports that one-third of pregnant teens receive insufficient prenatal care and that their children are more likely to suffer from health issues in childhood or be [[hospitalization|hospitalized]] than those born to older women. <ref>Guttmacher Institute. (1999, September). [http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_teen_sex.html Teen Sex and Pregnancy]. Retrieved May 29, 2006. </ref> . 

Young mothers who are given high-quality maternity care have significantly healthier babies than those that do not.  Many of the health-issues associated with teenage mothers, many of whom do not have health insurance, appear to result from lack of access to high-quality medical care. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Raatikainen K, Heiskanen N, Verkasalo PK, Heinonen S |title=Good outcome of teenage pregnancies in high-quality maternity care |journal=Eur J Public Health |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=157–61 |year=2006 |pmid=16141302 |doi=10.1093/eurpub/cki158}}</ref> . 

Many pregnant teens are subject to [[illnesses related to poor nutrition|nutritional deficiencies]] from poor [[diet (nutrition)|eating habit]]s common in adolescence, including attempts to [[weight loss|lose weight]] through [[dieting]], [[fasting|skipping meal]]s, [[food faddism]], [[Snack food|snacking]], and consumption of [[fast food]]. <ref>{{cite journal|author=Gutierrez Y, King JC |title=Nutrition during teenage pregnancy |journal=Pediatr Ann |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=99–108|year=1993 |pmid=8493060}}</ref> . 

Inadequate [[nutrition and pregnancy|nutrition during pregnancy]] is an even more marked problem among teenagers in [[developing country|developing countries]]. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Sanchez PA |title=Calcium and vitamin D status of pregnant teenagers in Maiduguri, Nigeria |journal=J Natl Med Assoc |volume=89 |issue=12 |pages=805–11 |year=1997|pmid=9433060 |pmc=2608295 |author-separator=, |author2=Idrisa A |author3=Bobzom DN |display-authors=3 |last4=Airede |first4=A |last5=Hollis |first5=BW |last6=Liston |first6=DE |last7=Jones |first7=DD |last8=Dasgupta |first8=A |last9=Glew |first9=RH }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Peña E, Sánchez A, Solano L |title=[Profile of nutritional risk in pregnant adolescents] |language=Spanish; Castilian |journal=Arch Latinoam Nutr |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=141–9|year=2003 |pmid=14528603 }}</ref> [[Complications of pregnancy]] result in the deaths of an estimated 70,000 teen girls in developing countries each year. Young mothers and their babies are also at greater risk of contracting [[HIV]]. <ref name=savethechildren/> The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that the risk of death following pregnancy is twice as great for women between 15 and 19 years than for those between the ages of 20 and 24. The maternal mortality rate can be up to five times higher for girls aged between 10 and 14 than for women of about twenty years of age. Illegal abortion also holds many risks for teenage girls in areas such as sub-Saharan Africa. <ref name=subsahara/> . 

Risks for medical complications are greater for girls 14 years of age and younger, as an underdeveloped [[human pelvis|pelvis]] can lead to difficulties in [[childbirth]]. Obstructed labour is normally dealt with by [[Caesarean section]] in [[developed country|industrialized nations]]; however, in developing regions where medical services might be unavailable, it can lead to [[eclampsia]], [[obstetric fistula]], [[infant mortality]], or [[maternal death]]. <ref name=savethechildren/> For mothers in their late teens, age in itself is not a risk factor, and poor outcomes are associated more with socioeconomic factors rather than with biology. <ref name=makinson/> . 

===Psychosocial===. 
Several studies have examined the [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic]], [[medicine|medical]], and [[psychology|psychological]] impact of pregnancy and parenthood in teens. Life outcomes for teenage mothers and their children vary; other factors, such as [[poverty]] or [[social support]], may be more important than the age of the mother at the birth. Many solutions to counteract the more negative findings have been proposed. Teenage parents who can rely on family and community support, social services and child-care support are more likely to continue their education and get higher paying jobs as they progress with their education. <ref>Stepp, G.

====In the mother====. 
Being a ''young mother'' in an industrialized country can affect one's [[education]]. Teen mothers are more likely to [[Dropping out|drop out]] of [[high school]]. <ref name=natcamp/> Recent studies, though, have found that many of these mothers had already dropped out of school prior to becoming pregnant, but those in school at the time of their pregnancy were as likely to graduate as their peers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} One study in 2001 found that women who gave birth during their teens completed [[secondary education|secondary-level schooling]] 10–12% as often and pursued [[post-secondary education]] 14–29% as often as women who waited until age 30. <ref>{{cite journal|author=Hofferth, Sandra L., Reid, Lori, Mott and Frank L. |year=2001|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3325901.html |title=The Effects of Early Childbearing On Schooling over Time|journal=Family Planning Perspectives|volume=33 |issue=6}}</ref>
''Young motherhood'' in an industrialized country can affect [[employment]] and [[social class]]. Less than one third of teenage mothers receive any form of child support, vastly increasing the likelihood of turning to the government for assistance. <ref>[http://moappp.org/Documents/pregnancypovertyschoolandemployment.pdf Pregnancy, Poverty, School and Employment].

Retrieved on 2011-12-03. </ref> The correlation between earlier childbearing and failure to complete high school reduces career opportunities for many young women. <ref name=natcamp/> One study found that, in 1988, 60% of teenage mothers were [[poverty|impoverished]] at the time of giving birth. <ref>Levine Coley, Rebekah and Chase-Lansdale, Lindsay.

Teenage Motherhood may actually make economic sense for young women with less money, some research suggests. For instance, long-term studies by Duke economist V. Joseph Hotz and colleagues, published in 2005, found that by age 35, former teen moms had earned more in income, paid more in taxes, were substantially less likely to live in poverty and collected less in public assistance than similarly poor women who waited until their 20s to have babies. Women who became mothers in their teens — freed from child-raising duties by their late 20s and early 30s to pursue employment while poorer women who waited to become moms were still stuck at home watching their young children — wound up paying more in taxes than they had collected in welfare. <ref>{{cite news |last=Males |first=Mike |authorlink=Mike Males |title=The real mistake in 'teen pregnancy' |work=Opinion |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2008-07-13 |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-op-males13-2008jul13,0,4392044.story|accessdate=2009-02-15}}</ref> Eight years earlier, the federally commissioned report "Kids Having Kids" also contained a similar finding, though it was buried: "Adolescent childbearers fare slightly better than later-childbearing counterparts in terms of their overall economic welfare."{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} . 

One-fourth of adolescent mothers will have a second child within 24 months of the first. Factors that determine which mothers are more likely to have a closely spaced repeat birth include marriage and education: the likelihood decreases with the level of education of the young woman – or her parents – and increases if she gets married. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Kalmuss DS, Namerow PB |title=Subsequent childbearing among teenage mothers: the determinants of a closely spaced second birth |journal=Fam Plann Perspect |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=149–53, 159 |year=1994 |pmid=7957815 |doi=10.2307/2136238 |jstor=2136238}}</ref> .

</ref> . 

Poor [[Grade (education)|academic performance]] in the children of teenage mothers has also been noted, with many of them being more likely than average to fail to [[graduation|graduate]] from secondary school, be held back a [[Educational stages|grade level]], or score lower on [[standardized testing|standardized tests]]. <ref name=natcamp/> Daughters born to adolescent [[parent]]s are more likely to become teen mothers themselves. <ref name=natcamp/><ref name=" Furstenberg "/> A son born to a young woman in her teens is three times more likely to [[sentence (law)|serve time]] in [[prison]]. <ref>Maynard, Rebecca A.

====In other family members====. 
Teen pregnancy and motherhood can influence younger siblings. One study found that the younger sisters of teen mothers were less likely to emphasize the importance of [[education]] and [[employment]] and more likely to accept [[human sexual behavior]], [[parenting]], and [[marriage]] at younger ages; younger brothers, too, were found to be more tolerant of [[illegitimacy|non-marital]] and early births, in addition to being more susceptible to [[Recklessness (psychology)|high-risk behavior]]s. <ref>{{cite journal|year=1996|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2814896.html |title=Do Adolescent Pregnancy and Childbearing Affect Younger Siblings?|journal=Family Planning Perspectives|volume= 28|issue=4|author=East, Patricia L.}}</ref> If the younger sisters of teenage parents babysit the children, they have an increased risk of getting pregnant themselves. <ref name=" Jacobson " /> . 

==Causes==. 
In some societies, early [[marriage]] and traditional [[gender role]]s are important factors in the rate of teenage pregnancy. For example, in some sub-Saharan African countries, early pregnancy is often seen as a blessing because it is proof of the young woman's fertility. <ref name=subsahara/> In the Indian subcontinent, early marriage and pregnancy is more common in traditional rural communities compared to the rate in cities. <ref name=escap/> The lack of education on safe sex, whether it’s from parents, schools, or otherwise, is a cause of teenage pregnancy. Many teenagers are not taught about methods of birth control and how to deal with peers who pressure them into having sex before they are ready. Many pregnant teenagers do not have any cognition of the central facts of sexuality. Some teens have said to be pressured into having sex with their boyfriends at a young age, and yet no one had taught these teens how to deal with this pressure or to say "no". <ref>{{cite journal|author=Macleod, C. |year=1999|title=The 'causes' of teenage pregnancy: Review of South African research—Part 2|volume= 29|issue=1|journal= South African Journal of Psychology}}</ref> . 

In societies where adolescent marriage is less common, such as many developed countries, young age at first [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] and lack of use of [[contraceptive]] methods (or their inconsistent and/or incorrect use; the use of a method with a high failure rate is also a problem) may be factors in teen pregnancy. <ref name=oecd/><ref name=toosoon>[http://aspe.hhs.gov/HSP/cyp/xsteesex.htm Beginning Too Soon: Adolescent Sexual Behavior, Pregnancy And Parenthood], US Department of Health and Human Services.

===Sexuality===. 
{{See also|Adolescent sexuality}}
In most countries, most men experience sexual intercourse for the first time before their 20th birthdays. <ref name=GImen>Guttmacher Institute (2003) ''In Their Own Right: Addressing the Sexual and Reproductive Health Needs of Men Worldwide.''  pages 19–21. </ref>  Men in Western developed countries have sex for the first time sooner than in undeveloped and culturally conservative countries such as Sub-Saharan Africa and much of Asia. <ref name=GImen /> Countries with low levels of teenagers giving birth accept sexual relationships among teenagers and provide comprehensive and balanced information about sexuality. <ref name=guttmacher2>Guttmacher Institute.

Retrieved August 8, 2006.{{clarify|date=May 2011|reason=This is a long list of reports:  Which one did the information actually come from?}}</ref> . 

However, in a [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] study of US teenagers, 29% of teens reported feeling pressure to have sex, 33% of sexually active teens reported "being in a relationship where they felt things were moving too fast sexually", and 24% had "done something sexual they didn’t really want to do". <ref name="kaiser" /> Several polls have indicated [[peer pressure]] as a factor in encouraging both girls and boys to have sex. <ref name="pollingdata" /><ref name="psychologytoday" /> . 

===Role of drug and alcohol use===. 
Inhibition-reducing [[Drug abuse|drugs]] and [[alcohol]] may possibly encourage unintended sexual activity. If so, it is unknown if the drugs themselves directly influence teenagers to engage in riskier behavior, or whether teenagers who engage in drug use are more likely to engage in sex. [[Correlation does not imply causation]]. The drugs with the strongest evidence linking to teenage pregnancy are [[alcohol]], [[MDMA|"ecstasy"]], [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], and [[amphetamine]]s. The drugs with the least evidence to support a link to early pregnancy are [[opioids]], such as [[heroin]], [[morphine]], and [[oxycodone]], of which a well-known effect is the significant reduction of [[libido]] – it appears that teenage [[opioid dependence|opioid]] [[recreational drug use|users]] have significantly reduced rates of conception compared to their non-using, and [[alcohol]], [[MDMA|"ecstasy"]], [[cannabis]], and [[amphetamine]] using peers. Amphetamines are often prescribed to treat [[ADHD]] – internationally, the countries with the highest rates of recorded amphetamine prescription to teenagers also have the highest rates of teenage pregnancy. <ref name=oecd/><ref name="kaiser"/><ref name=Besharov/><ref>[http://www.whygendermatters.com/ Why Gender Matters].

===Lack of contraception===. 
{{main|Birth control}} . 

Adolescents may lack knowledge of, or access to, conventional methods of preventing pregnancy, as they may be too embarrassed or frightened to seek such information. <ref name="pollingdata"/><ref name=" britsexed ">Slater, Jon. (2000). "[http://www.unesco.org/courier/2000_07/uk/apprend.htm Britain: Sex Education Under Fire]." ''The UNESCO Courier'' Retrieved July 7, 2006. </ref> Contraception for teenagers presents a huge challenge for the clinician. In 1998, the government of the United Kingdom set a target to halve the under-18 pregnancy rate by 2010. The Teenage Pregnancy Strategy (TPS) was established to achieve this. The pregnancy rate in this group, although falling, rose slightly in 2007, to 41.7 per 1000 women. Young women often think of contraception either as 'the pill' or condoms and have little knowledge about other methods. They are heavily influenced by negative, second-hand stories about methods of contraception from their friends and the media. Prejudices are extremely difficult to overcome. Over concern about side-effects, for example [[weight gain]] and [[acne]], often affect choice. Missing up to three pills a month is common, and in this age group the figure is likely to be higher. Restarting after the pill-free week, having to hide pills, drug interactions and difficulty getting repeat prescriptions can all lead to method failure. <ref>{{cite journal|author=Adams, A. and D'Souza, R.|year=2009|title= Teenage contraception|journal= General Practice Update|volume= 2|issue=6|pages= 36–39}}</ref> . 

In the United States, according to the 2002 National Surveys of Family Growth, sexually active adolescent women wishing to avoid pregnancy were less likely than those of other ages to use contraceptives (18% of 15- to 19-year-olds used no contraceptives, versus 10.7% average for women ages 15 to 44). <ref name=trusell&Wynn>National Surveys of Family Growth{{cite journal | journal = Contraception | title = Reducing unintended pregnancy in the United States | url = http://www.arhp.org/publications-and-resources/contraception-journal/january-2008| author = James Trussell and L.L.

</ref> Over half of [[unintended pregnancy|unintended pregnancies]] were to women not using [[contraceptives]],<ref name=trusell&Wynn /> most of the rest are due to inconsistent or incorrect use. <ref name=speidel /> 23% of sexually active young women in a 1996 ''Seventeen'' magazine poll admitted to having had [[Safe sex|unprotected sex]] with a partner who did not use a condom, while 70% of girls in a 1997 ''[[Parade (magazine)|PARADE]]'' poll claimed it was embarrassing to buy birth control or request information from a doctor. <ref name="pollingdata"/> . 

In a study for The Guttmacher Institute, researchers found that from a comparative perspective, however, teenage pregnancy rates in the United States are less nuanced than one might initially assume.  “Since timing and levels of sexual activity are quite similar across [Sweden, France, Canada, Great Britain, and the U.S.], the high U.S. rates arise primarily because of less, and possibly less-effective, contraceptive use by sexually active teenagers.”<ref name="DJE">{{cite web|last=Darroch|first=Jacqueline E.|title=Teenage Sexual and Reproductive Behavior in Developed Countries: Can More Progress Be Made?|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/eurosynth_rpt.pdf|publisher=The Alan Guttmacher Institute|accessdate=14 February 2011|coauthors=Jennifer J. Frost, Susheela Singh}}</ref>  Thus, the cause for the discrepancy between rich nations can be traced largely to contraceptive-based issues.  . 

Among teens in the UK seeking an abortion, a study found that the rate of contraceptive use was roughly the same for teens as for older women. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6279601.stm | work=BBC News | title=Teenage pregnancy myth dismissed | date=January 22, 2007 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}</ref> . 

In other cases, contraception is used, but proves to be inadequate. Inexperienced adolescents may use [[condom]]s incorrectly, forget to take [[combined oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptives]], or fail to use the contraceptives they had previously chosen. [[Pearl index|Contraceptive failure rates]] are higher for teenagers, particularly poor ones, than for older users. <ref name=Besharov>{{cite journal|author=Besharov, Douglas J. and Gardiner, Karen N. |year=1997|url=http://www.aei.org/paper/17757 |title=Trends in Teen Sexual Behavior|journal=Children and Youth Services Review|volume= 19 |issue=5/6|pages= 341–67|doi=10.1016/S0190-7409(97)00022-4}}</ref>  Long-acting contraceptives such as [[intrauterine device]]s, subcutaneous [[contraceptive implant]]s, and contraceptive injections (such as [[Depo-Provera]] and [[Combined injectable contraceptive]]), which prevent pregnancy for months or years at a time, are more effective in women who have trouble remembering to take pills or using barrier methods consistently.  . 

===Age discrepancy in relationships===. 
According to the conservative lobbying organization [[Family Research Council]], studies in the US indicate that age discrepancy between the teenage girls and the men who impregnate them is an important contributing factor. Teenage girls in relationships with older boys, and in particular with adult men, are more likely to become pregnant than teenage girls in relationships with boys their own age. They are also more likely to carry the baby to term rather than have an abortion. A review of California's 1990 vital statistics found that men older than high school age fathered 77% of all births to high school-aged girls (ages 16–18), and 51% of births to junior high school-aged girls (15 and younger). Men over age 25 fathered twice as many children of teenage mothers than boys under age 18, and men over age 20 fathered five times as many children of junior high school-aged girls as did junior high school-aged boys. A 1992 Washington state study of 535 adolescent mothers found that 62% of the mothers had a history of being raped or sexual molested by men whose ages averaged 27 years. This study found that, compared with nonabused mothers, abused adolescent mothers initiated sex earlier, had sex with much older partners, and engaged in riskier, more frequent, and promiscuous sex. Studies by the Population Reference Bureau and the National Center for Health Statistics found that about two-thirds of children born to teenage girls in the United States are fathered by adult men age 20 or older. <ref name="Hzu">Gracie Hsu, [http://jkalb.freeshell.org/misc/statutory.html Statutory rape] Family Research Council (courtesy link)</ref> . 

===Sexual abuse===. 
{{See also|Sexual abuse}} . 

Studies from South Africa have found that 11–20% of pregnancies in teenagers are a direct result of rape, while about 60% of teenage mothers had unwanted sexual experiences preceding their pregnancy. Before age 15, a majority of first-intercourse experiences among females are reported to be non-voluntary; the Guttmacher Institute found that 60% of girls who had sex before age 15 were coerced by males who on average were six years their senior.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} One in five teenage fathers admitted to forcing girls to have sex with them. <ref>Kerry Cullinan [http://web.archive.org/web/20081120202426/http://www.csa.za.org/article/articleview/259/1/1/ Teen mothers often forced into sex]. www.csa.za.org. 23 November 2003</ref> . 

Multiple studies have indicated a strong link between early childhood sexual abuse and subsequent teenage pregnancy in industrialized countries. Up to 70% of women who gave birth in their teens were molested as young girls; by contrast, 25% for women who did not give birth as teens were molested. <ref>Saewyc, E.M., Lara Leanne Magee, L.M., Pettingell, S.E., (2004) [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0NNR/is_3_36/ai_n6121836 Teenage pregnancy and associated risk behaviors among sexually abused adolescents], Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health, May–June, Findarticles.com.

In some countries, sexual intercourse between a minor and an adult is not considered consensual under the law because a minor is believed to lack the maturity and competence to make an informed decision to engage in fully consensual sex with an adult. In those countries, sex with a minor is therefore considered [[statutory rape]]. In most European countries, by contrast, once an adolescent has reached the age of consent, he or she can legally have sexual relations with adults because it is held that in general (although certain limitations may still apply), reaching the age of consent enables a juvenile to consent to sex with any partner who has also reached that age. Therefore, the definition of statutory rape is limited to sex with a person under the minimum age of consent. What constitutes statutory rape ultimately differs by jurisdiction (see [[age of consent]]).  . 

===Dating violence===. 
{{See also|Dating violence|Teen dating violence}} . 

Studies have indicated that adolescent girls are often in abusive relationships at the time of their conceiving. <ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite journal |author=Rosen D |title="I Just Let Him Have His Way" Partner Violence in the Lives of Low-Income, Teenage Mothers |journal=Violence Against Women |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=6–28|year=2004 |doi=10.1177/1077801203256069}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Quinlivan J |title=Teenage pregnancy |journal=O & G |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=25–6 |format=PDF |date=Winter 2006 |url=http://www.ranzcog.edu.au/publications/o-g_pdfs/OG-Winter-2006/teenage-pregnancy.pdf |accessdate=2009-06-22}}</ref> They have also reported that knowledge of their pregnancy has often intensified violent and controlling behaviors on part of their boyfriends. Women under age 18 are twice as likely to be beaten by their child's father than women over age 18. A UK study found that 70% of women who gave birth in their teens had experienced adolescent domestic violence. Similar results have been found in studies in the United States. A Washington State study found 70% of teenage mothers had been beaten by their boyfriends, 51% had experienced attempts of [[birth control sabotage]] within the last year, and 21% experienced school or work sabotage.  . 

In a study of 379 pregnant or parenting teens and 95 teenage girls without children, 62% of the girls aged 11–15 years and 56% of girls aged 16–19 years reported experiencing domestic violence at the hands of their partners. Moreover, 51% of the girls reported experiencing at least one instance where their boyfriend attempted to sabotage their efforts to use birth control. <ref>[http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:OeB_r4piiScJ:www.cpeip.fsu.edu/resourceFiles/resourceFile_73.pdf+%22teenage+mothers%22+domestic+violence&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=65&gl=us cpeip.fsu.edu]</ref> . 

===Socioeconomic factors===. 
Teenage pregnancy has been defined predominantly within the research field and among social agencies as a social problem. [[Poverty]] is associated with increased rates of teenage pregnancy. <ref name=Besharov/> Economically poor countries such as [[Niger]] and [[Bangladesh]] have far more teenage mothers compared with economically rich countries such as [[Switzerland]] and [[Japan]]. <ref name=globalis>[http://globalis.gvu.unu.edu/indicator.cfm?IndicatorID=127 Indicator: Births per 1000 women (15–19 ys) – 2002] UNFPA, State of World Population 2003, Retrieved Jan 22, 2007. </ref> . 

[[Image:The Child Mother.jpg|thumb|225px|A young poverty-stricken girl clutches her child. Image from ''ca'' 1884.]] . 

In the UK, around half of all pregnancies to under 18s are concentrated among the 30% most deprived population, with only 14% occurring among the 30% least deprived. <ref>"[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=6725 Teenage Conceptions By Small Area Deprivation In England and Wales 2001-2]" (Spring 2007)''Health Statistics Quarterly Volume 33''</ref> For example, in [[Italy]], the teenage birth rate in the well-off [[Central Italy|central regions]] is only 3.3 per 1,000, while in the poorer [[Mezzogiorno]] it is 10.0 per 1,000. <ref name=oecd/> Similarly, in the United States, sociologist [[Mike A.

There is little evidence to support the common belief that teenage mothers become pregnant to get benefits, welfare, and council housing. Most knew little about housing or financial aid before they got pregnant and what they thought they knew often turned out to be wrong. <ref name=psi/> . 

===Childhood environment===. 
Women exposed to abuse, [[domestic violence]], and family strife in childhood are more likely to become pregnant as teenagers, and the risk of becoming pregnant as a teenager increases with the number of adverse childhood experiences.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} According to a 2004 study, one-third of teenage pregnancies could be prevented by eliminating exposure to abuse, violence, and family strife. The researchers note that "family dysfunction has enduring and unfavorable health consequences for women during the adolescent years, the childbearing years, and beyond." When the family environment does not include adverse childhood experiences, becoming pregnant as an adolescent does not appear to raise the likelihood of long-term, negative psychosocial consequences. <ref>Tamkins, T. (2004) [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0NNR/is_2_36/ai_n6069104/pg_1 Teenage pregnancy risk rises with childhood exposure to family strife] Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health, March–April 2004</ref> Studies have also found that boys raised in homes with a battered mother, or who experienced physical violence directly, were significantly more likely to impregnate a girl. <ref>{{cite journal|title=Abused boys, battered mothers, and male involvement in teen pregnancy|journal=Pediatrics |volume=107 |issue=2 |page=E19 |year=2001 |pmid=11158493 |doi=10.1542/peds.107.2.e19|last1=Anda|first1=R.

Studies have also found that girls whose fathers left the family early in their lives had the highest rates of early sexual activity and adolescent pregnancy. Girls whose fathers left them at a later age had a lower rate of early sexual activity, and the lowest rates are found in girls whose fathers were present throughout their childhood. Even when the researchers took into account other factors that could have contributed to early sexual activity and pregnancy, such as behavioral problems and life adversity, early father-absent girls were still about five times more likely in the United States and three times more likely in New Zealand to become pregnant as adolescents than were father-present girls. <ref>Ellis, Bruce J. et al.

[[Foster care]] youth are more likely than their peers to become pregnant as teenagers. The National Casey Alumni Study, which surveyed foster care alumni from 23 communities across the United States, found the birth rate for girls in foster care was more than double the rate of their peers outside the foster care system. A University of Chicago study of youth transitioning out of foster care in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin found that nearly half of the females had been pregnant by age 19. The Utah Department of Human Services found that girls who had left the foster care system between 1999 and 2004 had a birth rate nearly 3 times the rate for girls in the general population. <ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.teenpregnancy.org/fostercare/Foster_Care_Project_FactSheet2.pdf Fostering Hope: Preventing Teen Pregnancy Among Youth in Foster Care]|42.1&nbsp;KB}} A Joint Project of The National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy and UCAN (Uhlich Children’s Advantage Network) 16 Feb 2006</ref> . 

=== Media influence ===. 
A study conducted in 2006 found that adolescents who were more exposed to sexuality in the media were also more likely to engage in sexual activity themselves. <ref>{{cite journal |last=L’Engle |first=Kelly Ladin |first2=Jane D. |last2=Brown |first3=Kristin |last3=Kenneavy |year=2006 |title=The mass media are an important context for adolescents' sexual behavior |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=186–192 |doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2005.03.020 |pmid=16488814 }}</ref> . 

According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', "teens exposed to the most sexual content on TV are twice as likely as teens watching less of this material to become pregnant before they reach age 20". <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1855842,00.html | work=Time | first=Alice | last=Park | title=Sex on TV Increases Teen Pregnancy, Says Report | date=November 3, 2008}}</ref> . 

==Prevention==. 
Many health educators have argued that comprehensive [[sex education]] would effectively reduce the number of teenage pregnancies, although opponents argue that such education encourages more and earlier sexual activity.  . 

===United Kingdom===. 
In the UK, the teenage pregnancy strategy, which was run first by the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] and is now based out of the Children, Young People and Families directorate in the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]], works on several levels to reduce teenage pregnancy and increase the social inclusion of teenage mothers and their families by: . 

* joined up action, making sure branches of government and health and education services work together effectively;
* prevention of teenage pregnancy through better sex education and improving contraceptive and advice services for young people, involving young people in service design, supporting the parents of teenagers to talk to them about sex and relationships, and targeting high-risk groups;
* better support for teenage mothers, including help returning to education, advice and support, work with young fathers, better childcare and increasing the availability of supported housing.  . 

The teenage pregnancy strategy has had mixed success. Although teenage pregnancies have fallen overall, they have not fallen consistently in every region, and in some areas they have increased. There are questions about whether the 2010 target of a 50% reduction on 1998 levels can be met.  . 

===United States===. 
In the United States the topic of sex education is the subject of much contentious debate. Some schools provide "abstinence-only" education and [[virginity pledge]]s are increasingly popular. A 2004 study by Yale and Columbia Universities found that 88% of those who pledge abstinence have premarital sex anyway. <ref>{{cite news |last=Hauser |first=Emily L. |title=Advise, console |work=Opinion |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=2008-09-07 |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2008/sep/07/opinion/chi-teen-pregnancy-thinksep07 |accessdate=2009-02-15}}</ref> Most public schools offer "abstinence-plus" programs that support abstinence but also offer advice about contraception. A team of researchers and educators in California have published a list of "best practices" in the prevention of teen pregnancy, which includes, in addition to the previously mentioned concepts, working to "instill a belief in a successful future", male involvement in the prevention process, and designing interventions that are culturally relevant. <ref name=joe>{{cite journal|author=Fe Moncloa, Marilyn Johns, Elizabeth J. Gong, Stephen Russell, Faye Lee and Estella West|year=2003|url=http://www.joe.org/joe/2003april/tt1.php |title=Best Practices in Teen Pregnancy Prevention Practitioner Handbook|journal=Journal of Extension|volume= 41|issue=2}}</ref> On September 30, 2010, The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services approved $155 million dollars in new funding for comprehensive sex education programs designed to prevent teenage pregnancy.  The money is being awarded "to states, non-profit organizations, school districts, universities and others. These grants will support the replication of teen pregnancy prevention programs that have been shown to be effective through rigorous research as well as the testing of new, innovative approaches to combating teen pregnancy."<ref>{{cite web|last=U.S. Department of Health & Human Services|title=HHS Awards Evidence-based Teen Pregnancy Prevention Grants|url=http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2010pres/09/20100930a.html|accessdate=15 February 2011}}</ref> . 

For teens who choose to engage in sexual activity, the primary mode of preventing teen pregnancy becomes correct use of contraceptives.  In the States, one policy initiative that has been used to increase rates of contraceptive use is Title X: Title X of the 1970 Public Health Service act provides family planning services for those who do not qualify for Medicaid by distributing “funding to a network of public, private, and nonprofit entities [in order to provide] services on a sliding scale based on income.”<ref>{{cite web|last=The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy|title=Policy Brief: Title X Plays a Critical Role in Preventing Unplanned Pregnancy|url=http://www.thenationalcampaign.org/resources/pdf/Briefly_PolicyBrief_TitleX.pdf|accessdate=15 February 2011}}</ref> Studies indicate that, internationally, success in reducing teen pregnancy rates is directly correlated with the kind of access that Title X provides: “What appears crucial to success is that adolescents know where they can go to obtain information and services, can get there easily and are assured of receiving confidential, nonjudgmental care, and that these services and contraceptive supplies are free or cost very little.”<ref name="DJE"/> In addressing high rates of unplanned teen pregnancies, scholars agree that the problem must be confronted from both the biological and cultural contexts.  . 

===Netherlands===. 
The Dutch approach to preventing teenage pregnancy has often been seen as a model by other countries. The curriculum focuses on values, attitudes, communication and negotiation skills, as well as biological aspects of reproduction. The media has encouraged open dialogue and the health-care system guarantees confidentiality and a non-judgmental approach. <ref name=dutchmodel>{{cite journal|author=Valk, Guus|year=2000|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001201/120152e.pdf|title= The Dutch Model|journal=The UNESCO Courier|volume=53|issue=7|page=19|date=July 2000|accessdate= July 3, 2011}}</ref> . 

===Developing world===. 
In the developing world, programs of reproductive health aimed at teenagers are often small scale and not centrally coordinated, although some countries such as Sri Lanka have a systematic policy framework for teaching about sex within schools. <ref name=escap/> Non-governmental agencies such as the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] and [[Marie Stopes International]] provide contraceptive advice for young women worldwide. Laws against [[child marriage]] have reduced but not eliminated the practice. Improved female [[literacy]] and educational prospects have led to an increase in the age at first birth in areas such as [[Iran]], Indonesia, and the Indian state of [[Kerala]].  . 

==Teenage fatherhood==. 
In some cases, the father of the child is the husband of the teenage girl. The conception may occur within wedlock, or the pregnancy itself may precipitate the marriage (the so-called [[shotgun wedding]]). In countries such as [[India]] the majority of teenage births occur within marriage. <ref name=oecd/><ref name=escap/> . 

In other countries, such as the [[United States]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]], the majority of teenage mothers are not married to the fathers of their children. <ref name=oecd/><ref>National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy. (2007). [http://www.teenpregnancy.org/resources/teens/facts/fact14.asp Do most teens who choose to raise the child get married when they find out they're pregnant?]</ref> In the UK, half of all teenagers with children are lone parents, 40% are cohabitating as a couple and 10% are married. <ref>"[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=7522&More=Y Census 2001 People aged 16–29]" ''Office For National Statistics''</ref> Teenage parents are frequently in a romantic relationship at the time of birth, but many adolescent fathers do not stay with the mother and this often disrupts their relationship with the child. Research has shown that when teenage fathers are included in decision-making during pregnancy and birth, they are more likely to report increased involvement with their children in later years. <ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.3149/fth.0103.283|author=Fagan, Jay; Barnett, Marina; Bernd, Elisa; and Whiteman, Valerie|year=2003|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0PAV/is_3_1/ai_111268934/pg_1 |title=Prenatal involvement of adolescent unmarried fathers|journal=Fathering|volume=1|issue=3|pages=283}}</ref> In the U.S, eight out of ten teenage fathers do not marry their first child's mother. <ref>[http://www.thenationalcampaign.org/why-it-matters/pdf/fatherhood.pdf "Teen Pregnancy and Responsible Fatherhood"] The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. </ref> . 

However, "teenage father" may be a misnomer in many cases. Studies by the [[Population Reference Bureau]] and the [[National Center for Health Statistics]] found that about two-thirds of births to teenage girls in the United States are fathered by adult men age 20 or older. <ref>De Vita, Carol J. (1996) [http://www.prb.org/Publications/PopulationBulletins/1996/TheUnitedStatesatMidDecade.aspx "The United States at Mid-Decade,"] Population Bulletin, vol. 50, no. 4 (Washington, D.C.: Population Reference Bureau, Inc., March 1996)</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/mvsr/supp/mv42_03s.pdf|title=Advance Report of Final Natality Statistics |year=1991|journal=Monthly Vital Statistics Report|volume= 42|issue=3, Supplement 9|publisher= National Center for Health Statistics|date=Sept. 1993|author=National Center for Health Statistic}}</ref> The Guttmacher Institute reports that over 40% of mothers aged 15–17 had sexual partners three to five years older and almost one in five had partners six or more years older. <ref>Family Planning Perspectives, July/August 1995. </ref> A 1990 study of births to California teens reported that the younger the mother, the greater the age gap with her male partner. <ref>California Resident Live Births, 1990, by Age of Father, by Age of Mother, California Vital Statistics Section, Department of Heath Services, 1992. </ref> In the UK 72% of jointly registered births to women under the age of 20, the father is over the age of 20, with almost 1 in 4 being over 25. <ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/FM1_34/FM1_no34_2005.pdf FM1 Birth statistics no.34 (2005)] ''Office For National Statistics'' pp 14–15. ''Note: 24% of births to women under 20 were solo registrations where the age of the father cannot be determined.''</ref> . 

==Society and culture==. 
Teenage pregnancy has been used as a theme or plot device in fiction, including [[book]]s, [[film]]s, and [[television series]]. The setting may be historical (''[[The Blue Lagoon (1980 film)|The Blue Lagoon]]'', ''Hope and Glory'') or contemporary (''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]''). While the subject is generally treated in a serious manner (''[[Junk (novel)|Junk]]''), it can sometimes play up to stereotypes in a comic manner ([[Vicky Pollard]] in '' [[Little Britain]]'').  . 

The pregnancy itself may be the result of [[sexual abuse]] (Rose in ''[[The Cider House Rules]]''), a [[one-night stand]] ([[Amy Barnes]] in ''[[Hollyoaks]]''), a romantic relationship ([[Demi Miller]] in ''[[EastEnders]]''); ([[Ronnie Mitchell]] in ''[[EastEnders]]''); or a first time sexual encounter ([[Sarah-Louise Platt]] in [[Coronation Street]]) unusually, in ''[[Quinceañera (film)|Quinceañera]]'', the central character becomes pregnant through [[non-penetrative sex]]. The drama often focuses around the discovery of the pregnancy and the decision to opt for [[abortion]] (''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''), [[adoption]] (''[[Mom at Sixteen]]'', [[Juno (film)|''Juno'']], [[Glee (TV Series)|''Glee'']]), [[marriage]] (''[[Sugar & Spice]]'', ''[[Reba (TV series)|Reba]]'' and ''[[Jeni, Juno]]'') or life as a [[single mother]] (''[[Saved!]]'', ''[[Where the Heart Is (2000 film)|Where the Heart Is]]'', ''[[Someone Like You (novel)|Someone Like You]]''). In the German play ''[[Spring Awakening (play)|Spring Awakening]]'' (and the [[Spring Awakening (musical)|Broadway musical based upon it]]), the central female character gets pregnant and dies from a botched abortion. ''[[Stephanie Daley]]'' deals with the aftermath of a teenage pregnancy that ends with a dead newborn baby. While the pregnant girl herself is normally the chief protagonist, ''[[Too Young to Be a Dad]]'' centers on a 15-year-old boy whose girlfriend becomes pregnant, while ''[[The Snapper (novel)|The Snapper]]'' focuses on the reactions of the family, particularly the soon-to-be grandfather.  . 

Other fiction, particularly in a long-running television series, looks at the long-term effects of becoming a parent at a very young age (''[[Degrassi Junior High]]''). In ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', because [[Lorelai Gilmore]] is only 16 years older than her daughter [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]], the two are more like sisters than parent and child. ''[[Looking for Alibrandi]]'' also features the teenage daughter of a woman who was herself a teenage mother. In ''[[The George Lopez Show]]'', Benny Lopez, gave birth to George at 16. In the [[ABC Family]] television show ''[[The Secret Life of the American Teenager]]'' centers on Amy Juergens, a 15-year-old who becomes a teenage mother after a one night stand. In the popular [[Comedy Central]] television show ''[[South Park]]'' the character [[Carol McCormick]] was said to have had her sons [[Kevin McCormick]] at 13, and [[Kenny McCormick]] at 16. In the Japanese drama ''[[14-sai no Haha: Aisuru tame ni Umaretekita]]'', the protagonist Miki Ichinose becomes pregnant with her boyfriend's child at age 14. The show examines the impact of her pregnancy on her, her family, her school life, the life of her boyfriend and his family, and the society in which she resides.  . 

Additionally, [[reality television]] shows have featured teenage pregnancy stories. [[MTV]] launched two reality shows about the topic, ''[[16 and Pregnant]]'' and ''[[Teen Mom]]'', in 2009. Each show depicts the gritty reality that pregnant teens face from friends and family while going through this life changing event, allowing teens to see what actually happens in this scenario through an outlet other than a scripted plot. [[Autobiographies]] that look at the author’s own experience of teenage motherhood include ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]]'' and ''Gather Together in My Name'' by [[Maya Angelou]], ''[[Coal Miner's Daughter]] '' by [[Loretta Lynn]], and ''[[Riding in Cars with Boys]]'' by [[Beverly D'Onofrio]].  . 

Songs about teenage pregnancy include downbeat tales of abuse ("[[Brenda's Got a Baby]]"), poverty ("[[In The Ghetto]]") and back-alley abortion ("[[Sally's Pigeons]]"), as well as upbeat and defiant tunes such as "[[Papa Don't Preach]]". American pop singer [[Fantasia Barrino]], who was 17 when she gave birth to her daughter, released a controversial song about single motherhood titled "[[Baby Mama (song)|Baby Mama]]", describing the difficulty of raising a child alone with limited financial and family support. (Many U.S. radio stations would not play the song, ostensibly because it contains a [[profanity]].) "There Goes My Life", a modern [[country music|country]] song by [[Kenny Chesney]], focuses on the reaction of the father, who rhetorically asks, "I'm just a kid myself; how am I going to raise one?" As the daughter grows up, his attitude changes, and the song ends with his tearful farewell as she leaves for college. Due to its implied [[pro-life]] message, "There Goes My Life" was sung at the inauguration of [[George W. Bush]] in 2005.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} .
