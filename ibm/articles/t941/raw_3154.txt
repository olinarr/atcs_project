'''Unintended pregnancies''' include '''unwanted pregnancies''' as well as those that are '''mistimed'''. <ref name=BestIntent />  Worldwide, 38% of [[pregnancy|pregnancies]] were unintended in 1999 (some 80 million unintended pregnancies in 1999). <ref name=speidel /><ref name=sharing />  Unintended pregnancies are the primary cause of induced [[abortion]],<ref name=BestIntent /><!-- page 50 --> resulting in about 42 million induced abortions, and 34 million unintended births per year. <ref name=speidel />  Unintended pregnancy is also a major cause of [[maternal death|maternal]] and [[infant mortality|infant]] deaths.  . 

The use of modern contraceptive methods has greatly reduced the incidence of unintended pregnancy, particularly in more developed countries.  However the United States has an unusually high rate of unintended pregnancy, especially among the poor.   . 

Providing [[family planning]] services and modern [[birth control|contraceptives]] to those who do not have access to them would prevent a large proportion of unintended pregnancies and abortions, as well as many maternal and infant deaths, slow environmental degradation, and save billions of dollars a year in health care, education and other costs. <ref name=addingitup/>  Reducing unintended pregnancy also reduces the rate of child abuse, and child poverty and improves maternal and child mental and physical health. <ref name=BestIntent /><ref name=Monea2011 /> . 

Unintended pregnancies may arise within a [[committed relationship]], such as [[marriage]], as well as resulting from [[casual sex]]ual activity, or even as a result of [[rape]].  . 

==Family planning==. 
Becoming pregnant and having a baby are major events in a female's life, as well as that of her partner and family.  . 

===Intention===. 
Intended pregnancies are those that are clearly and consciously desired at the time of conception. <ref name=BestIntent /><!-- page 3 -->  Unintended pregnancies are those that were not wanted at the time of conception. <ref name=BestIntent /><!-- page 22 -->  Intention and desire can be complex, possibly represented by a scale, with possible levels of ambivalence, in addition to clearly defined extremes. <ref name=BestIntent /><!-- page 22 -->  Among unintended pregnancies, mistimed pregnancies are those that occurred sooner than desired, whereas unwanted pregnancies are those occurring when no more pregnancies were desired. <ref name=BestIntent /><!-- page 22 --> . 

[[sexual partner|Partners]] have similar intentions regarding most pregnancies, however intention status of a pregnancy may be different for the female and male.  Some studies only gather data on female partner's pregnancy intention.   . 

Attitudes towards a pregnancy can change during the course of pregnancy. For instance, discovery of a congenital disease might lead to termination of an initially intended pregnancy. (See also [[Wrongful birth]] - legal cause of action by parents of congenitally diseased child who would have chosen not to have the pregnancy or child had their practitioner followed the standard of care in informing them of the risks of the congenital disease.) . 

=== Mistimed pregnancies ===. 
Couples desire to control not just the number of children, but also the timing. <ref name=AGI1999 />  Health outcomes for the child and for the mother are improved by not starting to have children too early, and by allowing adequate spacing between births.  Economic and social factors, such as completing education and achieving a level of economic security, also play roles in desires when to have children.  . 

== Causes ==. 
* Not using [[contraception]]. <ref name=speidel />
* Using contraception inconsistently or incorrectly. <ref name=speidel />
* Contraceptive failure (the method was used correctly, but did not work.)<ref name=speidel />  Contraceptive failure accounts for a relatively small fraction of unintended pregnancies when modern highly effective contraceptives are used. <ref name="Hatcher20th">{{cite book

Reasons contraceptives might not have been used or been used incorrectly include:
* Coercion.  [[Rape]] or involuntary sex which sometimes happens in the context of [[Domestic violence and pregnancy|domestic violence]]. Unintended pregnancies are more likely to be associated with abuse than intended pregnancies. <ref>J.E. Hathaway, L.A. Mucci and J.G. Silverman et al., Health status and health care use of Massachusetts women reporting partner abuse, Am J Prev Med 19 (2000), pp. 302–307. </ref>  This may also include [[birth control sabotage]] - manipulation of someone's use of birth control to undermine efforts to prevent pregnancy. 
* Lack of knowledge about sex and reproduction.  Including erroneous beliefs. 
* Lack of knowledge or experience with the contraceptive, or lack of motivation to use it correctly. 
* Lack of planning or ambivalence about whether to have a child.  . 

== Results ==. 
Unintended pregnancies result in poorer outcomes for the mother and for the child, if birth occurs.  Unintended pregnancy precludes [[pre-conception counseling]], and [[pre-conception care]], and delays initiation of [[prenatal care]]. <ref name=HP2020FP />  The great majority of abortions result from unintended pregnancies.  . 

Results of unintended pregnancy include:
* Prenatal care initiate later, and less adequate. <ref name=BestIntent /><!-- page 66 - 68 -->  Adversely affects health of woman and of child and less preparation for parenthood. <ref name=BestIntent /><!-- page 66 - 68 -->  Delay from unintended pregnancy is in addition to that from other risk factors for delay. <ref name=BestIntent /><!-- page 66 - 68 -->  Unwanted pregnancies have more delay than mistimed. <ref name=BestIntent /><!-- page 66 - 68 -->

=== Maternal deaths ===. 
{{main| Maternal death}} . 

Over the six years between 1995 and 2000 there were an estimated 338 million pregnancies that were unintended and unwanted worldwide (28% of the total 1.2 billion pregnancies during that period). <ref name=promises />  These unwanted pregnancies resulted in nearly 700,000 maternal deaths (approximately one-fifth of maternal deaths during that period). <ref name=promises>{{cite journal| title = Promises to Keep: The Toll of Unintended Pregnancies on Women's Lives in the Developing World | url = http://www.globalhealth.org/news/article/2319 | accessdate=2009-01-22}}</ref>
More than one-third of the deaths were from problems associated with pregnancy or childbirth, but the majority (64%) were from complications from [[unsafe abortion|unsafe or unsanitary abortion]]. <ref name=promises/>  Most of the deaths occurred in less developed parts of the world, where [[family planning]] and [[reproductive health]] services were less available. <ref name=promises/> . 

Pre and postnatal depression contributes to increased risk of suicide among pregnant women and mothers.  Suicide contributes to the rate of maternal mortality; where the rate of maternal deaths from physical causes is reduced by medically safe abortions and child delivery, the proportion from psychological problems can become more significant.{{cn|date=April 2012}} . 

In cultures that practice [[honor killing]], unintended pregnancy may increase the woman's chance of being killed.{{cn|date=April 2012}} . 

== Prevention ==. 
{{main|Family planning}} . 

Prevention includes comprehensive [[sexual education]], availability of [[family planning]] services, including access to a range of effective [[birth control]] methods.  Most unintended pregnancies result from not using contraception, and many result from using contraceptives inconsistently or incorrectly.  Increasing use of [[long-acting reversible contraceptive]]s (such as [[IUD]] and [[contraceptive implant]]s) decreases the chance of unintended pregnancy by decreasing the chance of incorrect use.  Method failure is relatively rare with modern, highly effective contraceptives, and is much more of an issue when such methods are unavailable, unaffordable, or not used.  (See [[comparison of contraceptive methods]]).  . 

In the United States, women who have an unintended pregnancy are more likely to have subsequent unplanned pregnancies. <ref name=ahrq2011 />  Providing family planning and contraceptive services as part of prenatal, postpartum and post abortion care can help reduce recurrence of unintended pregnancy.  . 

Providing contraceptives and family planning services at low or no cost to the user helps prevent unintended pregnancies.  Many of those at risk of unintended pregnancy have little income, so even though contraceptives are highly cost-effective,<ref name=Trussell2009>{{cite journal|journal = Contraception|year = 2009| volume=79|issue = 1| pmid=19041435| pages = 5–14| title = Cost effectiveness of contraceptives in the United States | author = James Trussell, Anjana Lalla, Quan Doan, Eileen Reyes, Lionel Pinto, Joseph Gricar| doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2008.08.003}}</ref> up front cost can be a barrier.  Subsidized family planning services improve the health of the population and saves money for governments and health insurers by reducing medical,<ref name=HP2020FP /> education and other costs to society.  . 

Providing modern contraceptives to the 201 million women at risk of unintended pregnancy in developing countries who do not have access to contraception would cost an estimated US$3.9 billion per year. <ref name=addingitup/>  This expenditure would prevent an estimated 52 million unintended pregnancies annually, preventing 1.5 million [[maternal mortality|maternal]] and child deaths annually, and reduce induced abortions by 64% (25 million per year). <ref name=addingitup/>  Reduced illness related to pregnancy would preserve 27 million [[Quality-adjusted life year|healthy life year]]s, at a cost of $144 per year of healthy life. <ref name=addingitup>{{cite report| title=Adding it Up: The Benefits of Investing In Sexual and Reproductive Health Care | url = http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/covers/addingitup.html | publisher = The [[Alan Guttmacher Institute]] and [[United Nations Population Fund|UNFPA]] | author = Susheela Singh, Jacqueline E.

Factors that are likely to have led to this decline include: The introduction of the [[combined oral contraceptive|birth control pill]] in 1960, and its subsequent rapid increase in popularity; the completion of legalization of contraceptives in the 1960s and early 1970s; the introduction of federal funding for family planning in the 1960s and [[Title X]] in 1970; and the legalization of abortion, which was completed in 1973.  The decline in birth rate was associated with reductions in the number of children put up for adoption and reduction in the rate of neonaticide.  . 

* It is unclear to what extent legalization of abortion may have increased the availability of the procedure. <ref name=BestIntent /><!-- page 51 -->  It is estimated that before legalization about 1 million abortions were performed annually. <ref name=BestIntent /><!-- page 51 -->  Before legalization, abortion was probably one of the most common criminal activities. <ref name=BestIntent /><!-- page 51 -->  Before legalization, an estimated 1,000 to 10,000 women died each year from complications of poorly preformed abortions. <ref name=BestIntent />  Legalization was followed by a decrease in pregnancy related deaths in young women, as well as decrease in hospital admissions for incomplete or septic abortions, conditions more common than induced abortion. <ref name=BestIntent /><!-- page 51 --> . 

* The infanticide rate during the first hour of life dropped from 1.41 per 100,000 during 1963 to 1972 to 0.44 per 100,000 for 1974 to 1983; the rate during the first month of life also declined, whereas the rate for older infants rose during this time. <ref name=Paul>{{cite book| title = Management of unintended and abnormal pregnancy: comprehensive abortion care | author = Maureen Paul | page = 34 | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | isbn = 978-1405176965 }}</ref> . 

The rate of unintended pregnancy declined significantly from 1987 until 1994, due to increased contraceptive use<ref name=Henshaw1998/><ref name=Finer2006 />  Since then until 2001 the rate has remained relatively unchanged. <ref name=Finer2006>{{cite journal | author = Finer L, Henshaw S. | title = Disparities in rates of unintended pregnancy in the United States, 1994 and 2001 | journal = Perspect Sex Reprod Health | date = 2006 Jun | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 90–6 | doi=10.1363/3809006 | pmid=16772190}}</ref>

The proportion of births that were unintended at time of conception decreased during the 1970s and early 1980s.  Between 1982 and 1988 the proportion of births that were unintended began increasing. <ref name=BestIntent /><!-- page 2 -->  In 1990 about 44% of births were unintended at time of conception. <ref name=BestIntent /><!-- page 2 -->  The fraction of births that were unintended at time of conception was even higher among poor women (almost 60%), never-married women (73%) and unmarried teens (86%). <ref name=BestIntent /><!-- page 2 --> . 

Among poor women, the rate of unintended pregnancy and unintended birth rose from 1994 to 2001, while it declined for the more affluent women (those >200% of federal poverty level). <ref name=Finer2006 />  (Unintended pregnancy rose almost 30% and unintended births rose 50% for those below federal poverty level.)  Contraceptive use had been increasing for years, but stopped in the 1990s, and began to decline among poorer women. <ref name=Kaufman>{{cite news| title =  Unplanned Pregnancy Increases among Poor | author = Marc Kaufman | url = http://www.commondreams.org/headlines06/0505-07.htm | publisher = San Francisco Chronicle | accessdate = 2011-08-23 | date = May 5, 2006 }}</ref>  Cuts in federal and state family planning programs may account for the decreased use of contraceptives and increase in unintended pregnancies. <ref name=Kaufman/> . 

==== Costs and potential savings ====. 
The public cost of unintended pregnancy is estimated to be about 11 billion dollars per year in short term medical costs. <ref name=Monea2011 />  This includes costs of births, one year of infant medical care and costs of fetal loss. <ref name=Monea2011 />  Preventing unintended pregnancy would save the public over 5 billion dollars per year in short term medical costs. <ref name=Monea2011 />  Savings in long term costs and in other areas would be much larger. <ref name=Monea2011>{{cite journal | journal = Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health | year = 2011 | month = June | volume = 43 | author = Monea J, Thomas A | title = Unintended pregnancy and taxpayer spending | pages = 88–93 | doi = 10.1363/4308811 | pmid=21651707 | issue = 2}}</ref>
By another estimate, the direct medical costs of unintended pregnancies, not including infant medical care, was $5 billion in 2002. <ref name="Trussell07">{{cite journal

==== Prevention ==== . 

In the US it is estimated that 52% of unintended pregnancies result from couples not using [[birth control|contraception]] in the month the woman got pregnant, and 43% result from inconsistent or incorrect contraceptive use; only 5% result from contraceptive failure, according to a report from the [[Guttmacher Institute]]. <ref name=speidel>{{cite journal|journal = Contraception | year = 2008 | month = September | title = The Potential of Long-acting Reversible Contraception to Decrease Unintended Pregnancy | author = J. Joseph Speidel, Cynthia C. Harper, and Wayne C. Shields | url = http://www.arhp.org/publications-and-resources/contraception-journal/september-2008 }}</ref>  Contraceptive use saved an estimated $19 billion in direct medical costs from unintended pregnancies in 2002. <ref name="Trussell07" /> . 

In 2006, publicly funded family planning services ([[Title X]], medicaid, and state funds) helped women avoid 1.94 million unintended pregnancies, thus preventing about 860,000 unintended births and 810,000 abortions. <ref name=guttmacherPubBC />  Without publicly funded family planning services, the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions in the United States would be nearly two-thirds higher among women overall and among teens; the number of unintended pregnancies among poor women would nearly double<ref name=guttmacherPubBC>{{cite web|year=2011|month=February|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_contraceptive_serv.html|title=Facts on Publicly Funded Contraceptive Services in the United States|publisher=[[Guttmacher Institute]]|accessdate=August 12, 2011}}</ref>
The services provided at publicly funded clinics saved the federal and state governments an estimated $5.1 billion in 2008 in short term medical costs. <ref name=guttmacherPubBC />  Nationally, every $1.00 invested in helping women avoid unintended pregnancy saved $3.74 in Medicaid expenditures that otherwise would have been needed. <ref name=guttmacherPubBC /> . 

Reducing unintended pregnancy in the United States would be particularly desirable since abortion is such a politically divisive issue. <ref name=BestIntent /><!-- page 54 --> . 

The CDC encourages men and women to formulate a [[reproductive life plan]], to help them in avoiding unintended pregnancies and to improve the health of women and reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes. <ref>{{cite journal| author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. | title=Recommendations to improve preconception health and health care — United States: a report of the CDC/ATSDR Preconception Care Work Group and the Select Panel on Preconception Care.| journal=MMWR|year=2006|volume=55|issue=No. RR-6}}</ref> . 

==== Rape ====. 
A longitudinal study in 1996 of over 4000 women in the United States followed for 3 years found that the [[Effects and aftermath of rape|rape-related pregnancy]] rate was 5.0% among victims aged 12–45 years. Applying that rate to rapes committed in the United States would indicate that there are over 32,000 pregnancies in the United States as a result of rape each year. <ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0002-9378(96)70141-2 | last1 = Holmes | first1 = MM | last2 = Resnick | year = 1996 | first2 = HS | last3 = Kilpatrick | first3 = DG | last4 = Best | first4 = CL | title = Rape-related pregnancy: estimates and descriptive characteristics from a national sample of women | url = | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 175 | issue = 2| pages = 320–324 | pmid = 8765248 }}</ref> . 

== History == . 

{{see also|History of abortion|History of condoms|Timeline of reproductive rights legislation|}} . 

Early ways of preventing unwanted pregnancy included [[withdrawal]] and various alternatives to intercourse; they are difficult to use correctly and, while much better than no method, have high failure rates compared to modern methods. <ref name=AGI1999 /><ref name=Potts2009>{{cite web | author = Potts, M, Campbell, M | work = Glob. libr. women's med. | issn = 1756-2228 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.3843/GLOWM.10376|title = History of contraception| url = http://www.glowm.com/?p=glowm.cml/section_view&articleid=375 }}</ref>  Various devices and medications thought to have [[spermicides|spermicidal]], contraceptive, abortifacient or similar properties were also used.  . 

Abortions have been induced to prevent unwanted births since antiquity,<ref name=BestIntent /><!-- page 51 --> abortion methods are described in some of the earliest medical texts. <ref name=Potts2009/>  The degree of safety of early methods relative to the risks of child birth is unclear. <ref name=Potts2009/> . 

[[Infanticide]] (‘customary [[neonaticide]]’) or [[child abandonment|abandonment]] (sometimes in the form of exposure) are other traditional way of dealing with babies that were not wanted or that a family could not support. <ref name=Potts2009 />  Opinions on the morality or desirability of the practices have changed through history.  . 

Where modern contraceptives are not available, abortion has sometimes been used as a major way of preventing birth.  For instance in much of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics in the 1980s, desired family size was small, but modern contraceptive methods were not readily available, so many couples relied on abortion, which was legal, safe, and readily accessible, to regulate births. <ref name=AGI1999 />  In many cases, as contraceptives became more available the rate of unintended pregnancy and abortion dropped rapidly during the 1990s. <ref name=AGI1999 /> . 

In the 19th and 20th century, the desired number of pregnancies has declined as reductions in infant and childhood mortality have increased the probability that children will reach adulthood.  Other factors, such as level of education and economic opportunities for women, have also lead to reductions in the desired number of children. <ref name=AGI1999 >{{cite web|url = http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/ib_0599.html | title = Abortion in Context: United States and Worldwide | publisher = Alan Guttmacher Institute | date = May 1999 | accessdate = 2011-08-28}}</ref>  As the number of desired number of children decreases, couples spend more of their reproductive lives trying to avoid unintended pregnancies. <ref name=AGI1999 /> . 

== In society and culture == . 

Unintended pregnancy can be an indicator of [[premarital sex]], which may carry social stigma, result in persecution or [[honor killing]].  Sometimes, in order to prevent [[illegitimate children]], [[forced marriage]]s result.  Such marriages typically have poorer outcomes than voluntary marriage.  . 

In many industrialized nations there is increasing acceptance of premarital sex, [[single parent]]ing, and children born outside wedlock.  . 

Unintended pregnancy is common as a cause of stress or social stigma in fictional works.  It plays a role in many portrayals of [[Illegitimacy in fiction|illegitimacy]] and [[teen pregnancy#Society and culture|teen pregnancy]].  .
