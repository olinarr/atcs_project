'''Birth control''' is an [[umbrella term]] for several techniques and methods used to prevent fertilization or to interrupt [[pregnancy]] at various stages. Birth control techniques and methods include [[contraception]] (the prevention of fertilization), [[contragestion]] (the prevention of the [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] of the [[blastocyst]]) and [[abortion]] (the removal or expulsion of a [[fetus]] or [[embryo]] from the [[uterus]]).  Contraception includes [[barrier methods]], such as [[condoms]] or [[diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]], [[hormonal contraception]], also known as oral contraception, and [[injectable contraceptives]]. <ref name="Hendrick 1997 102">{{Cite book| last = Hendrick| first = Judith| title = Legal aspects of child health care| publisher = Nelson Thomas | year = 1997| page = 102| url = http://books.google.com/?id=drcEwZHasKQC&dq=contraception+contragestion+popular+use| isbn = 9780412583209 |ref=harv}}</ref> Contragestives, also known as post-coital birth control, include [[intrauterine devices]] and what is known as the [[morning after pill]]. <ref>{{harvnb|Hendrick|1997|p=103}}</ref>

===Mechanisms of action and terminology=== . 

The function of birth control can be classified by the stage of reproduction during which it is active.  A form of birth control which prevents the sperm from fertilizing the egg is a contraceptive agent. <ref>{{cite book|first1=June L. |last1=Melloni|first2=Ida G. |last2=Dox|first3=B.

The term ''contraception'' is a contraction of ''contra'', which means ''against'', and the word ''conception'', meaning fertilization. <ref>{{cite book|author=American Heritage|chapter=contraception |title=The American Heritage Medical Dictionary|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kT7ykAhh3fsC&pg=PA120 |date=7 May 2008|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-618-94725-6|pages=120 |ref={{harvid|American Heritage Medical Dictionary|2008}}}}</ref> The word ''contragestion'' is likewise a combination of ''contra'' and ''gestation''.  French scientist [[Étienne-Émile Baulieu]] coined the word in 1985 because he felt that there was a need for a technical term to describe the prevention of implantation, which did not fit the traditional definitions of either ''contraception'' or ''abortion''. <ref name="jstor1">{{cite journal |jstor=1704267 |pages=1351–7 |last1=Baulieu |first1=E.

These mechanisms of action are not always mutually exclusive.  One substance or device can have more than one potential effect depending upon when it is used.  For example, while [[mifepristone]] is best known as an abortifacient, it can also function as a contragestive agent. <ref name="jstor1"/>  Likewise, the [[IUD]] can be used as a contraceptive or a contragestive depending upon when it is inserted. <ref>{{cite journal |jstor=3522225 |pages=46–48 |last1=Morris |first1=B.

===Contraception===.

[[Image:Ortho tricyclen.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Ortho Tri-cyclen, a U.S. brand of oral contraceptive, in a dial dispenser.]]
Contraception, defined as the prevention of fertilisation, includes [[barrier methods]], which stop the possibility of sperm and egg meeting (e.g. [[condoms]] or the [[diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]]), and [[hormonal contraception]], which suppresses [[ovulation]] (the release of an egg). The hormones can be [[injectable contraceptives|delivered by injection]]<ref name="Hendrick 1997 102"/>, by mouth (orally), or [[intravaginal administration|placed in the vagina]]. The most common types of oral contraception include the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] and the [[minipill]]. <ref>{{Cite book| last = Ammer| first = Christine| coauthors = Manson, JoAnn E, & Brigham, Elizabeth F.| title = The Encyclopaedia of Woemn’s Health| publisher = Infobase Publishing| year = 2009| page = 312  | url = http://books.google.com/?id=_MRDimrELCIC&dq=hormonal+contragestion| isbn = 9780816074075 |ref=harv}}</ref> Hormonal [[emergency contraception]] can be both contraceptive and [[contragestive]].  . 

===Contragestion===. 
[[Contragestion|Contragestives]], articles and chemicals which prevent the implantation of a fertilised egg, include [[intrauterine devices]] (IUD) and some forms of hormonal [[emergency contraception]]. <ref>{{harvnb|Ammer|2009|p=2}}</ref>
[[Image:IUDCPCopperT380A.gif|thumb|right|200px|An intrauterine device.]] . 

===Sterilization===. 
[[Sterilisation (medicine)|Surgical sterilization]] is available in the form of [[tubal ligation]] for women and [[vasectomy]] for men. Although sterilization is considered a permanent procedure, it is possible to attempt a [[tubal reversal]] to reconnect the [[Fallopian tubes]] in females or a [[vasectomy reversal]] to reconnect the ''[[vasa deferentia]]'' in males. The rate of success depends on the type of sterilization, tubal damage, and the patient's age. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.womenshealth.about.com/cs/surgery/a/tubligreversalp.htm |title=Tubal Ligation Reversal |publisher=Womenshealth.about.com |date=2009-11-11 |accessdate=2012-01-29}}</ref> . 

===Behavioral methods===. 
Behavioral methods involve [[Calendar-based contraceptive methods|regulating the timing]] or methods of intercourse to prevent  the introduction of sperm into the female reproductive tract, either altogether or when an egg may be present.  . 

====Lactational====. 
{{Main|Lactational amenorrhea method}}
From ancient times women tried to extend breastfeeding in order to avoid a new pregnancy. The [[lactational amenorrhea method]], or LAM, gives guidelines for determining the length of a woman's period of breastfeeding infertility.  . 

====Fertility awareness====. 
Symptoms-based methods of [[fertility awareness]] involve a woman's observation and charting of her body's fertility signs, to determine the fertile and infertile phases of her cycle.  Charting may be done by hand or with the assistance of [[fertility monitor]]s. Most methods track one or more of the three primary fertility signs:<!--
 --><ref name="tcoyf">{{cite book | first=Toni | last=Weschler | year=2002 | title=Taking Charge of Your Fertility | page=52 | edition=Revised | publisher=HarperCollins | location=New York | isbn=0-06-093764-5 }}</ref> changes in [[basal body temperature]], in cervical mucus, and in cervical position. If a woman tracks both basal body temperature and another primary sign, the method is referred to as ''symptothermal''.  Other bodily cues such as [[mittelschmerz]] are considered secondary indicators.  . 

[[Calendar-based methods]] such as the rhythm method and Standard Days Method estimate the likelihood of fertility based on the length of past menstrual cycles.  To avoid pregnancy with fertility awareness, unprotected sex is restricted to the least fertile period. During the most fertile period, barrier methods may be availed, or she may abstain from intercourse. 
''' . 

The term ''[[natural family planning]]'' (NFP) is sometimes used to refer to any use of fertility awareness methods. However, this term specifically refers to the practices that are permitted by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] — [[#Lactational|breastfeeding infertility]] for example. FA methods may be used by NFP users to identify these fertile times.  . 

====Coitus interruptus====. 
''[[Coitus interruptus]]'' (literally "interrupted sexual intercourse"), also known as the withdrawal or pull-out method, is the practice of ending sexual intercourse ("pulling out") before ejaculation. The main risk of coitus interruptus is that the man may not perform the maneuver correctly, or may not perform the maneuver in a timely manner. Although concern has been raised about the risk of pregnancy from sperm in [[pre-ejaculate]], several small studies<ref name="HIV study">{{cite journal |pmid=12286905 |year=1993 |title=''Researchers find'' no sperm in pre-ejaculate fluid |volume=14 |issue=10 |pages=154–6 |journal=Contraceptive technology update}}</ref><ref name="pre-e study">{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1022933320700 |year=2003 |last1=Zukerman |first1=Zvi |last2=Weiss |first2=David B. |last3=Orvieto |first3=Raoul |journal=Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=157–9 |pmid=12762415 |title=Does preejaculatory penile secretion originating from Cowper's gland contain sperm?}}</ref> have failed to find any viable sperm in the fluid.  . 

====Avoiding semen near vagina====. 
[[Non-penetrative sex]] is used to avoid pregnancy, but pregnancy can still occur with [[Intercrural sex]] and other forms of penis-near-vagina sex (genital rubbing, and the penis exiting from [[anal intercourse]])
where semen can be deposited near the entrance to the vagina and can itself travel along the vagina's lubricating fluids.  . 

====Sexual abstinence====. 
Though some groups advocate total [[sexual abstinence]], by which they mean the avoidance of all sexual activity, in the context of birth control the term usually means abstinence from vaginally penetrative sexual activity. <ref name="ppabst">{{cite web |title=Abstinence |work=Planned Parenthood |year=2009 |url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/abstinence-4215.htm |accessdate=2009-09-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Murthy |first1=Amitasrigowri S |last2=Harwood |first2=Bryna |title=Contraception Update |publisher=Springer |edition=2nd |year=2007 |location=New York |pages=Abstract |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/xq0504lxw48250x1/ |isbn=978-0-387-32327-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Barrier methods |journal=Information Services Bulletin  |pages=1–4 |publisher=Popline |month=August |year=1979 |url=http://db.jhuccp.org/ics-wpd/exec/icswppro.dll?BU=http://db.jhuccp.org/ics-wpd/exec/icswppro.dll&QF0=DocNo&QI0=791849&TN=Popline&AC=QBE_QUERY&MR=30%25DL=1&&RL=1&&RF=LongRecordDisplay&DF=LongRecordDisplay |accessdate=2009-09-09}}</ref> .

====For males====. 
{{Main|Male contraceptive}}
Other than condoms and withdrawal, there is currently only one common method of birth control available. This option is undergoing a vasectomy,  a minor surgical procedure wherein the vasa deferentia of a man are severed, and then tied/sealed in a manner which prevents sperm from entering the seminal stream (ejaculate). Several methods are in [[research and development]]: . 

*As of 2007, a chemical called [[Adjudin]] was in Phase II human trials as a [[male oral contraceptive]]. <ref>{{cite journal | title=Male Contraceptive Methods Are in the Pipeline |author=Finn, Robert |journal=Ob. Gyn. News |volume=42 |page=28 |date=May 1, 2007 |url=http://www.obgynnews.com/article/PIIS0029743707703956/fulltext |doi=10.1016/S0029-7437(07)70395-6}}</ref>
* [[Reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance]] (RISUG) consists of injecting a polymer gel, [[styrene maleic anhydride]] in [[dimethyl sulfoxide]], into the [[vas deferens]]. The polymer has a positive charge, and when negatively charged sperm pass through the vas deferens, the charge differential severely damages the sperm. An injection with sodium bicarbonate washes out the substance and restores fertility. <ref name=PPAA>{{cite web|title=Expanding Options for Male Contraception|url=http://blog.advocatesaz.org/2011/08/08/expanding-options-for-male-contraception/|publisher=[[Planned Parenthood]] Advocates of Arizona|accessdate=1 April 2012|month=8 August|year=2011}}</ref>
* Experiments in [[vas-occlusive contraception]] involve an implant placed in the [[vasa deferentia]]. 
* Experiments in [[heat-based contraception]] involve heating the testicles to a high temperature for a short period of time. Ultrasound is the application of high-frequency sound waves to the testes, which can absorb the sound waves’ energy as heat, leading to temporary infertility. <ref name=PPAA>{{cite web|title=Expanding Options for Male Contraception|url=http://blog.advocatesaz.org/2011/08/08/expanding-options-for-male-contraception/|publisher=[[Planned Parenthood]] Advocates of Arizona|accessdate=1 April 2012|month=8 August|year=2011}}</ref>
* Research on the safety and effectiveness of using [[ultrasound]] treatments to kill sperm has undergone since the idea originally came about following experiments in the 1970s by Mostafa S. Fahim which noticed ultrasound killed microbes and decreased fertility. <ref name=Murray>{{cite web|last=Murray|first=Rheana|title=Ultrasound kills sperm, could be the future of male birth control: study|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_19843262|publisher=[[Daily News (New York){{!}}Daily News]]|accessdate=30 January 2012|month=30 January|year=2012}}</ref> As of 2012 a study conducted on rats found that two 15 minute treatments of ultrasound delivered 2 days apart in a warm salt bath effectively lowered their sperm count to below fertile levels. <ref name=Murray/> Further experiments on its effectiveness on humans, the longevity of the results, and its safety have yet to be conducted. <ref name=Murray/> . 

==Effectiveness==. 
{{Merge from|Dual protection|date=December 2009}}
:<span class="boilerplate seealso">''See also the table at: [[Comparison of birth control methods]]''</span> . 

The effectiveness of a birth control method is generally expressed by how many women become pregnant using the method in the first year of use. Thus, if 100 women use a method that has a 0 percent first-year failure rate, then 0 of the women should become pregnant during the first year of use. This equals 0 pregnancies per 100 woman-years, an alternative unit. Sometimes the effectiveness is expressed in lifetime failure rate, more commonly among methods with high effectiveness, such as [[vasectomy]] after the appropriate negative semen analysis. <ref>[http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=597295175&linkID=10752&cook=no GPnotebook > failure rate ( vasectomy )] Retrieved on January 4, 2009</ref> . 

The most effective methods in typical use are those that do not depend upon regular user action. Surgical sterilization, Depo-Provera, implants, and [[intrauterine device]]s (IUDs) all have first-year failure rates of less than one percent for perfect use. In reality, however, ''perfect'' use may not be the case, but still, sterilization, implants, and IUDs also have ''typical'' failure rates under one percent.  The typical failure rate of Depo-Provera is disagreed upon, with figures ranging from less than one percent up to three percent. <!--

Other methods may be highly effective if used consistently and correctly, but can have typical use first-year failure rates that are considerably higher due to incorrect or ineffective usage by the user. Hormonal contraceptive pills, patches or rings, fertility awareness methods, and the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), if used strictly, have first-year (or for LAM, first-6-month) failure rates of less than 1%. <!--

Condoms and cervical barriers such as the diaphragm have similar typical use first-year failure rates (14 and 20 percent, respectively), but perfect usage of the condom is more effective (three percent first-year failure vs six percent) and condoms have the additional feature of helping to prevent the spread of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s such as the [[HIV virus]]. The withdrawal method, if used consistently and correctly, has a first-year failure rate of four percent. Due to the difficulty of consistently using withdrawal correctly, it has a typical use first-year failure rate of 19 percent,<!--

==History==. 
<!-- linked from redirect [[History of birth control]] --> . 

===Early history===. 
==== Ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt and Rome ====. 
Birth control and [[infanticide]] are well documented in [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Egypt]]. One of the earliest documents explicitly referring to birth control methods is the [[Kahun Gynecological Papyrus]] from about 1850 BCE. It describes various contraceptive [[pessary|pessaries]], including [[acacia gum]], which recent research has confirmed to have [[spermicide|spermatocidal]] qualities and is still used in contraceptive jellies. Other birth control methods mentioned in the papyrus include the application of gummy substances to cover the "mouth of the womb" (i.e. the [[cervix]]), a mixture of honey and [[sodium carbonate]] applied to the inside of the [[vagina]], and a pessary made from crocodile dung. [[Lactation]] (breast-feeding) of up to three years was also used for birth control purposes in ancient Egypt. <ref name=Lipsey2005>{{cite book |last1=Lipsey |first1= Richard G. |last2=Carlaw |first2=Kenneth |last3=Bekar |first3=Clifford |chapter=Historical Record on the Control of Family Size |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=tSrGTMtBv50C&pg=PA335 |pages=335–40 |title=Economi Transformations: General Purpose Technologies and Long-Term Economic Growth |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-19-928564-8}}</ref>
[[Image:Silphium.jpg|frame|right|Ancient silver coin from [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] depicting a stalk of [[Silphium]].]]
Plants with contraceptive properties were used in [[Ancient Greece]] from the 7th century BCE onwards and documented by numerous ancient writers on [[gynaecology]], such as [[Hippocrates]]. The botanist [[Theophrastus]] documented the use of [[Silphium]], a plant well known for its contraceptive and [[abortifacient]] properties. The plant only grew on a small strip of land near the coastal city of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] (located in modern day [[Libya]]), with attempts to cultivate it elsewhere failing. Its price increased due to high demand, leading to it being worth "more than its weight in silver" by the 1st century BC. The high demand eventually led to the extinction of Silphium during the third or 2nd century BC. [[Asafoetida]], a close relative of siliphion, was also used for its contraceptive properties. Other plants commonly used for birth control in ancient Greece include Queen Anne's lace ([[Daucus carota]]), [[willow]], [[date palm]], [[pomegranate]], [[pennyroyal]], [[Artemisia (plant)|artemisia]], [[myrrh]], and [[rue]]. Some of these plants are toxic and ancient Greek documents specify safe dosages. Recent studies have confirmed the birth control properties of many of these plants, confirming for example that Queen Anne's lace has post coital anti-fertility properties. Queen Anne's lace is still used today for birth control in [[India]]. Like their neighboring ancient Greeks, [[Ancient Romans]] practiced contraception and [[abortion]]. <ref name=Lipsey2005/> . 

==== Religious texts ====. 
The [[Book of Genesis]] references withdrawal, or [[coitus interruptus]], as a method of contraception when [[Onan]] "spills his seed" (ejaculates) on the ground so as to not father a child with his [[widow inheritance|deceased brother's wife]] [[Tamar]]. The [[Talmud]] states that "there are three women that may cohabit with a sponge: a minor, a pregnant woman and one that nurses her child". Subsequent commentaries clarify that the "sponge" was an absorbent material, such as cotton or wool, intended to block [[sperm]]. <ref name="Middleberg 2003 4">{{Cite book| last = Middleberg| first = Maurice I.| title = Promoting reproductive security in developing countries| publisher = Springer| year = 2003| page = 4| url = http://books.google.com/?id=8LR7GSmNGUsC&dq=Avicenna++Muhammad+ibn+Zakariya+ar-Razi+birth+control| isbn = 9780306474491 }}</ref> . 

==== Ancient China ====. 
In the 7th century BC, the Chinese physician [[Master Tung-hsuan]] documented both [[coitus reservatus]] and [[coitus obstructus]], which prevents the release of semen during intercourse. However, it is not known if these methods were used primarily as birth control methods or to preserve the man's [[Yin and yang|yang]]. In the same century [[Sun Ssu-mo]] documented the "thousand of gold contraceptive prescription" for women who no longer want to bear children. This prescription, which was supposed to induce sterility, was made of oil and quicksilver heated together for one day and taken orally. <ref name="Middleberg 2003 4"/> . 

==== India ====. 
Indians used a variety of birth control methods since ancient times, including a potion made of powdered [[Palm tree|palm leaf]] and [[red chalk]], as well as vaginal suppositories made of [[honey]], [[ghee]], [[rock salt]] or the seeds of [[palasa tree]]. A variety of birth control prescriptions, mainly made up of herbs and other plants, are listed in the 12th century [[Ratirahasya]] ("Secret of Love") and the [[Anangaranga]] ("The Stage of the God of Love"). <ref name="Middleberg 2003 4"/> . 

==== Early Islam ====. 
In the late 9th to early 10th century, the Persian physician [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]] documents [[coitus interruptus]], preventing ejaculation and the use of suppositories to block the [[cervix]] as birth control methods. He describes a number of suppositories, including elephant dung, [[cabbages]] and [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]], used alone or in combination {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. During the same period [[Ali ibn Abbas al-Majusi]] documents the use of suppositories made of rock salt for women for whom [[pregnancy]] may be dangerous. In the early 10th century the Persian Polymath [[Abu Ali al-Hussain ibn Abdallah ibn Sina]], known in Europe as Avicenna, included a chapter on birth control in his medical encyclopedia [[The Canon of Medicine]], documenting 20 different methods of preventing conception. <ref name="Middleberg 2003 4"/> .

In [[modern Europe]], knowledge of herbal abortifacients and contraceptives to regulate fertility has largely been lost.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Historian [[John Riddle|John M.

On December 5, 1484, Pope Innocent VIII issued the ''[[Summis desiderantes affectibus]]'', a papal bull in which he recognized the existence of witches and gave full papal approval for the [[Inquisition]] to proceed "correcting, imprisoning, punishing and chastising" witches "according to their deserts." In the bull, which is sometimes referred to as the "Witch-Bull of 1484", the witches were explicitly accused of having "slain infants yet in the mother's womb" (abortion) and of "hindering men from performing the sexual act and women from conceiving" (contraception). <ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080523174317/http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/mm00e.html ''The Bull of Innocent VIII''] as published in the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' translated by [[Montague Summers]]</ref> Famous texts that served to guide the witch hunt and instruct magistrates on how to find and convict so-called "witches" include the [[Malleus Maleficarum]], and [[Jean Bodin]]'s "De la demonomanie des sorciers". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bvh.univ-tours.fr/Consult/index.asp?numfiche=221 |title=Jean Bodin (1580).

The authors accused witches, among other things, of [[infanticide]] and having the power to steal men's penises. <ref>Broedel, Hans Peter (2004). The Malleus Maleficarum and the Construction of Witchcraft: Theology and Popular Belief. Manchester University Press, p. 34</ref> . 

Barrier methods such as the [[condom]] have been around much longer, but were seen primarily as a means of preventing [[sexually transmitted diseases]], not pregnancy. [[Giacomo Casanova|Casanova]] in the 18th century was one of the first reported using "assurance caps" to prevent impregnating his mistresses. <ref>{{cite book|first=Peter |last=Fryer|title=The birth controllers|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_rkjAAAAYAAJ|location=London|year=1965|publisher=Secker & Warburg}}<br/>{{cite journal |author=Dingwall EJ |title=Early contraceptive sheaths |journal=Br Med J |volume=1 |issue=4800 |pages=40–1 |year=1953 |month=January |pmid=12997834 |pmc=2015111 |doi=10.1136/bmj.1.4800.40 }}<br/>in {{cite book |last=Lewis  |first=M. |chapter=A Brief history of condoms |editor-first=Adrian |editor-last=Mindel|title=Condoms|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zWxoQgAACAAJ |date=14 February 2000|publisher=BMJ Books|isbn=978-0-7279-1267-1}}</ref> . 

===Birth control and public policy===. 
{{See also|Timeline of reproductive rights legislation}} . 

Restrictive legislation on birth control was continually employed by European governments throughout the period of [[mercantilism]] and formed the backbone of the populationist strategy of this era. The mercantillists argued that a large population was a form of wealth, making it possible to create bigger markets and armies. The intense violence during the mercantilist era of the 17th and 18th centuries in Europe can be seen as a result of successful political implementation of [[population growth]] by means of restricting birth control, which created an enormous [[youth bulge]]. This youth bulge, as explained by [[War#Youth bulge theory|the theory of that name]], in turn fueled [[Imperialism|imperialist]] expansion of the European empires.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} . 

Birth control was a contested political issue in Britain during the 19th century. [[Malthusian]]s were in favour of limiting population growth and therefore promoted birth control through organisations such as the [[Malthusian League]], while the idea was opposed by a variety of groups, for different reasons, from the [[socialist]]s to the [[established church]].  . 

In the [[Soviet Union]], to facilitate social equality between men and women, birth control was made readily available. [[Alexandra Kollontai]] (1872–1952), commissar for public welfare during this time, also promoted birth control education for adults.  . 

In France, women fought for reproductive rights and they helped end the nation's ban on birth control in 1965. In Italy women gained the right to access birth control information in 1970. <ref>Hunt, Lynn, Thomas R. Martin, Barbara H. Rosenwein, R. Po-chia Hsia, and Bonnie G. Smith. The Making of the West: Peoples and Cultures. Third ed. Vol. C. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2009. </ref> . 

A recent, well-studied example of governmental restriction of birth control in order to promote higher birth rates was the post-World War II [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] era in [[Romania]]. <ref>{{cite book|author=Gail Kligman|title=The politics of duplicity: controlling reproduction in Ceausescu's Romania|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nXuaVeRortkC|accessdate=26 February 2012|date=6 July 1998|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-21075-2}}</ref><ref>http://www.demogr.mpg.de/Papers/workshops/010623_paper25.pdf</ref> . 

The [[Holy See|Vatican]]'s opposition towards birth control continues to this day and has been a major influence on U.S. policies concerning the problem of population growth and unrestricted access to birth control. <ref>http://www.population-security.org/index.html#15</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.population-security.org/phil95.htm |title=The Vatican’s Role in the World Population Crisis: the untold story by Stephen D.

===Etymology and movement===. 
The phrase "birth control" entered the English language in 1914 and was popularised by [[Margaret Sanger]] and [[Otto Bobsein]]. <ref name="Wilkinson Meyer 2004 184">{{Cite book| last = Wilkinson Meyer| first = Jimmy Elaine| title = Any friend of the movement: networking for birth control, 1920-1940| publisher = Ohio State University Press | year = 2004| page = 184| url = http://books.google.com/?id=bdl78Y2eRcEC&dq=birth+control+history+margaret+sanger| isbn = 9780814209547 }}</ref><ref name="Galvin">{{Cite journal| last = Galvin| first = Rachel| title = Margaret Sanger's "Deeds of Terrible Virtue"| journal = National Endowment for the Humanities | url = http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/1998-09/sanger.html| accessdate = 24 October 2010 }}</ref> Sanger was mainly active in the United States, but had gained an international reputation by the 1930s. The birth control campaigner [[Marie Stopes]], who had opened Britain’s first birth control clinic in 1921 and made contraception acceptable during the 1920 by framing it in scientific terms, also gained an international reputation. Stopes was particularly influential in helping emerging birth control movements in a number of [[British colonies]]. <ref>{{Cite book| last = Blue| first = Gregory| coauthors = , Bunton, Martin P. & Croizier, Ralph C.| title = Colonialism and the modern worls: selected studies| publisher = M.E.

===Recent Trends=== . 

The IUD is enjoying a "well-deserved renaissance" in America, according to Dr. David A. Grimes, with usage more than tripling between 2002 and 2011.  During the year ending August 2011, IUDs were 10.4% of all birth control methods provided by doctors, as women increasingly view the IUD as the most convenient, safe, and most effective yet reversible form of contraception.

===Legal status===. 
====United States====. 
Some states formerly had laws prohibiting the use of contraception. In 1965, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in the case ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' that a [[Connecticut]] law prohibiting the use of contraceptives violated the "right to marital privacy". In 1972, the case ''[[Eisenstadt v. Baird]]'' expanded the right to possess and use contraceptives to unmarried couples.  . 

Recently, as an implementation policy of the 2009 Affordable Health Care for America Act, the Department of Health and Human Services developed a mandate to require all insurance policies to provide for free contraceptives. In 2012, the [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] led an attempt to exempt insurance policies sponsored or paid for by religious institutions opposed to birth control on religious or moral grounds, from the mandate to provide free contraceptive care. The GOP opposition to this mandate is based on the view that it violates the "[[Free Exercise Clause]]" of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The bill was dismissed by the [[U.S. Senate]] by a vote of 51-48 along largely partisan lines and is viewed as a victory for President [[Barack Obama]]'s health care law. <ref>http://www.vancouversun.com/health/Contraception+challenge+rejected+Senate/6234790/story.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter. Vancouver Sun. March 1, 2012. </ref> . 

====France====. 
The [[1920 in France|1920]] Birth Law contained a clause that criminalizes dissemination of birth-control literature. <ref>{{cite book|last=Soubiran|first=Andre|title=Diary of a Woman in White|publisher=Avon Books|year=1969|edition=English|page=61}}</ref> That law, however, was annulled in 1967 by the Neuwirth Law, thus authorizing contraception, which was followed in 1975 with the Veil Law. Only 5% of French women aged 18 to 45 do not use contraception.  .

===Sex education===. 
Many teenagers, most commonly in developed countries, receive some form of [[sex education]] in school. What information should be provided in such programs is hotly contested, especially in the United States and United Kingdom. Topics include reproductive anatomy, human sexual behavior, information on sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), social aspects of sexual interaction, negotiating skills intended to help teens follow through with a decision to remain abstinent or to use birth control during sex, and information on birth control methods.  . 

One type of sex education program used in some more conservative areas of the United States is called [[abstinence-only education]], and it generally promotes complete [[sexual abstinence]] until [[marriage]].  The programs do not encourage birth control, often provide inaccurate information about contraceptives and sexuality,<ref>

Advocates of abstinence-only education believe that the programs will result in decreased rates of teenage pregnancy and STD infection.  . 

Abstinence-only sex education programs show an increase in the rates of pregnancy and STDs of a teenage population in [[randomized controlled trial]]s. <!--

===Arguments against misconceptions of birth control===. 
Modern misconceptions and [[urban legend]]s have given rise to false claims. Below are the arguments against those false claims. 
* The suggestion that [[douche|douching]] with any substance immediately following intercourse works as a contraceptive is untrue. While it may seem like a sensible idea to try to wash the ejaculate out of the vagina, it is not likely to be effective. Due to the nature of the fluids and the structure of the female reproductive tract, douching most likely actually spreads semen further towards the uterus. Some slight spermicidal effect may occur if the douche solution is particularly acidic, but overall it is not scientifically observed to be a reliably effective method.  Douching is neither a contraceptive nor a preventative measure against STDs or other infections. 
* It is untrue that a female cannot become pregnant as a result of the first time she engages in sexual intercourse.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}
* While women are usually less fertile for the first few days of menstruation,<!--

Having sex while standing up or with a woman on top will not keep the sperm from entering the uterus.

* Though [[intrauterine devices]] (IUDs) are popular in many parts of the world, many people in the United States believe they are dangerous, probably in large part due to the widely publicized health risks associated with an IUD model called the [[Dalkon Shield]]. In reality, the most recent models of the IUD, [[ParaGard]] and [[Mirena]], are both extremely safe and effective. <ref name="guttmacher2007"/> .
