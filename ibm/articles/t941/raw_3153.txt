{{wiktionary|virgin}} . 

'''Virginity''' refers to the state of a person who has never engaged in [[sexual intercourse]]. There are cultural and religious traditions which place special value and significance on this state, especially in the case of unmarried females, associated with notions of personal purity, [[honor]] and worth. Like [[chastity]], the concept of virginity has traditionally involved [[sexual abstinence]] before marriage, and then to engage in sexual acts only with the marriage partner.  . 

Unlike the term [[premarital sex]], which can refer to more than one occasion of [[human sexual activity|sexual activity]] and can be judgment neutral, the concept of virginity usually involves [[sexual morality|moral]] or religious issues and can have consequences in terms of social status and in [[interpersonal relationship]]s.  . 

The term originally only referred to sexually inexperienced women, but has evolved to encompass a range of definitions, as found in traditional, modern, and ethical concepts. <ref name="McAnulty">{{Cite book|author= Richard D.

==Etymology and usage==. 
The word ''virgin'' comes via [[Old French]] ''virgine'' from the [[root]] form of Latin {{lang|la|''[[wikt:virgo|virgo]]''}}, [[Genitive case|genitive]] {{lang|la|''virgin-is''}}, meaning literally "maiden" or "[[almah|virgin]]"—a sexually intact young woman<ref>Charlton T. Lewis and Charles Short, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2351070 'virgo'], in ''[[A Latin Dictionary]]''. </ref> or "sexually inexperienced woman". As in Latin, the English word is also often used with wider reference, by relaxing the age, [[gender]] or sexual criteria. <ref name="AHD">[http://www.yourdictionary.com/virgin 'virgin'] in ''[[American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]''. </ref> Hence, more mature women can be virgins ([[Elizabeth I of England|The Virgin Queen]]), men can be virgins, and potential initiates into many fields can be colloquially termed ''virgins''; for example, a skydiving "virgin". In the latter usage, ''virgin'' simply means uninitiated.  . 

The Latin word likely arose by analogy with a suit of [[lexeme]]s based on {{lang|la|''vireo''}}, meaning "to be green, fresh or flourishing", mostly with [[Botany|botanic]] reference—in particular, {{lang|la|''virga''}} meaning "strip of wood". <ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=virgin 'Virgin'], ''Online Etymology Dictionary''. </ref>
The first known use of ''virgin'' in English comes from an [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] manuscript held at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. 
*''c''. '''1200''': Ðar haueð ... martirs, and confessors, and '''uirgines''' maked faier bode inne to women. — ''[[List of illuminated Anglo-Saxon manuscripts|Trinity College Homilies]]'' 185 [ms B.15.34 (369)]
In this, and many later contexts, the reference is specifically [[Christian]], alluding to members of the Ordo Virginum known to have existed since the early church from the writings of the [[Church Fathers]]. <ref>
[http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p123a9p4.htm 'Consecrated virgins and widows',] ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' 922–24. </ref> However, within about a century, the word was expanded to apply also to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], the mother of [[Jesus]], hence to sexual virginity explicitly. 
*''c''. '''1300''': Conceiud o þe hali gast, born o þe '''virgine''' marie. — ''[[Cursor Mundi]]'' 24977
Further expansion of the word to include virtuous (or naïve) young women, irrespective of religious connection, occurred over about another century. 
*''c''. '''1400''': Voide & vacand of vices as '''virgyns''' it ware. — ''[[Alexander Romance|The Wars of Alexander]]'' 4665
These are just three of the eighteen definitions of ''virgin'' from the first edition of the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (OED1, pages 230-232). Most of the OED1 definitions, however, are very similar.  . 

The [[German language|German]] word for "virgin" is ''[[wikt:Jungfrau|Jungfrau]]''. ''Jungfrau'' literally means "young woman", but is not used in this sense. Instead "junge Frau" can be used. The rather dated German word for a young (unmarried) woman, without implications regarding sexuality, is ''[[wikt:Fräulein|Fräulein]]''. ''Fräulein'' was used in German as a title of respect, equivalent to current usage of [[Miss]] in English. ''Jungfrau'' is the word reserved specifically for sexual inexperience. As ''[[wikt:Frau|Frau]]'' means "woman", it suggests a female referent. Unlike English, German also has a specific word for a male virgin ''[[wikt:Jüngling|Jüngling]]'' ("''Youngling''"). It is, however, dated too and rarely used. ''Jungfrau'', with some masculine modifier, is more typical, as evidenced by the film, ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]'', about a 40 year-old ''male'' virgin, titled in German, "Jungfrau (40), männlich, sucht…". <ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405422/releaseinfo Release dates for ''The 40-Year-Old Virgin''] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref> Note that the term used for the [[starsign]] [[Virgo (astrology)|virgo]] also is Jungfrau, which makes the above movie title ambiguous. German also distinguishes between young women and [[girl]]s, who are denoted by the word ''[[wikt:Mädchen|Mädchen]]''. The English [[cognate]] "maid" was often used to imply virginity, especially in poetry.  . 

German is not the only language to have a specific name for male virginity; in French, male virgins are called "[[wikt:puceau|puceau]]". Males presenting with [[phimosis]] who injure their [[Frenulum of prepuce of penis|frenulum]] during first penetration are said to be "uncartridged" as opposed to "cartridged" before first intercourse. <ref>[http://www.phimosis-circumcision.com/library/passages/hymen.html Phimosis-circumcision.com]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref>{{clarify|date=March 2012}} . 

By contrast, the Greek word for "virgin" is ''parthenos'' ([[wikt:παρθένος|παρθένος]], see [[Parthenon]]). Although typically applied to women, like English, it is also applied to men, in both cases specifically denoting absence of sexual experience. When used of men, it does not carry a strong association of "never-married" status. However, in reference to women, historically, it was sometimes used to refer to an engaged woman—''parthenos autou'' (παρθένος αὐτού, his virgin) = his [[Engagement|fiancée]] as opposed to ''gunē autou'' (γυνή αὐτού, his woman) = his wife. This distinction is necessary due to there being no specific word for wife (or husband) in Greek.  . 

By extension from its primary sense, the idea that a virgin has a sexual "blank slate",<ref name="Shanahan">"The emotional stress of [[Serial monogamy|serial]] non-marriage plays havoc with the possibility of partnering for life." Angela Shanahan, [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22419704-7583,00.html 'Sex revolution robbed us of fertility',] ''[[The Australian]]'' 15 September 2007. </ref> unchanged by any past intimate connection or experience,<ref name=Shanahan /> leads to the abstraction of unadulterated purity.  . 

==Culture==. 
===Definitions of virginity loss===. 
There are varying understandings as to which types of sexual activities result in loss of virginity. The traditional view is that virginity is only lost through vaginal penetration by the penis, consensual or non-consensual, and that acts of [[oral sex]], [[anal sex]] and [[mutual masturbation]] do not constitute virginity loss. Engaging in such acts with no history of having engaged in vaginal intercourse is considered "technical virginity" among differing heterosexuals and researchers. <ref name="Intimate"/><ref name="Carpenter"/><ref name="C.

Since the early 1990s, the concept of "technical virginity" has been popular among heterosexual American [[Adolescence|teenagers]]. <ref name=BOOKS.google.com/><ref name=www.usatoday.com/> For example, oral sex is common among adolescent girls who [[fellatio|fellate]] their boyfriends to create and maintain intimacy while preserving their virginity, avoiding pregnancy, or both. <ref name="BOOKS.google.com" /><ref name="www.usatoday.com" /> In a 1999 study published in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'', the definition of sex was examined based on a 1991 random sample of 599 college students from 29 US states; it found that 60% said oral-genital contact (like fellatio, [[cunnilingus]]) did not constitute having sex. "That's the 'technical virginity' thing that's going on," said Stephanie Sanders, associate director of the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction]]. Sanders, as the co-author of the study, and along with other researchers, titled the findings "Would You Say You 'Had Sex' If ...?"<ref name=www.usatoday.com/> In another study, published in 2001 in ''[[The Journal of Sex Research]]'', over half of respondents considered that virginity could only be lost through having consensual sex. <ref name="consent"/> However, in a study released in 2008 by the [[Guttmacher Institute]], author of the findings Laura Lindberg stated that there "is a widespread belief that teens engage in nonvaginal forms of sex, especially oral sex, as a way to be sexually active while still claiming that technically, they are virgins," but that her study drew the conclusion that "research shows that this supposed substitution of oral sex for vaginal sex is largely a myth". <ref name="oral sex for intercourse">{{cite press release |title=Perception That Teens Frequently Substitute Oral Sex For Intercourse A Myth|publisher= |date=2008-05-20 |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/2008/05/20/index.html |accessdate=March 12, 2012}}</ref> . 

[[Virginity pledge]]s (or abstinence pledges) made by heterosexual teenagers and young adults may also include the practice of "technical virginity." In a peer-reviewed study by sociologists [[Peter Bearman]] and Hannah Brueckner, which looked at virginity pledgers five years after their pledge, they found that the pledgers have similar proportions of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STDs) and at least as high proportions of anal and oral sex as those who have not made a virginity pledge, and deduced that there was substitution of oral and anal sex for vaginal sex among the pledgers. However, the data for anal sex without vaginal sex reported by males did not reflect this directly. <ref name="webmdVPDCSR"/><ref name="promise"/>  . 

Some historians and [[anthropology|anthropologists]] note that many societies before the [[sexual revolution]] that place a high value on maintaining virginity for marriage actually have a large amount of premarital sexual activity that does not involve vaginal penetration.  . 

===Female virginity===. 
====Cultural value====. 
[[File:Jules Arsene Gardier - Le Droit Du Seigneur (retouched).jpg|thumb|250px|''Le Droit Du Seigneur'' (1872) by [[Jules Arsène Garnier]]]]
The first act of sexual intercourse by a female is commonly considered within many cultures to be an important personal milestone. Its significance is reflected in expressions such as "saving oneself", "losing one's virginity," "taking someone's virginity" and sometimes as "deflowering." The occasion is at times seen as the end of innocence, integrity, or purity, and the [[sexualization]] of the individual.  . 

Traditionally, there was a cultural expectation that a female would not engage in [[premarital sex]] and would come to her wedding a virgin, which would be indicated by the bride wearing a white gown, and that she would "give up" her virginity to her new husband in the act of [[consummation]] of the marriage.  . 

In some cultures, it is so important that a female be a virgin that a female will refrain from inserting any object into her vagina, such as a [[tampon]], [[menstrual cup]] or [[dildo]], or undergoing some medical examinations, so as not to damage the [[hymen]]. Some females who have been previously sexually active (or their hymen has been otherwise damaged) may undergo a surgical procedure, called [[hymenorrhaphy]] or hymenoplasty, to repair or replace her hymen, and cause vaginal bleeding on the next intercourse as proof of virginity ([[#Proof of virginity|see below]]). <ref name=Regain>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/wtMostRead/idUSL2532025120070430?pageNumber=2&sp=true |title=Muslim women in France regain virginity in clinics |work=[[Reuters]] | date=April 30, 2007}}</ref> In some cultures, an unmarried female who is found not to be a virgin, whether by choice or as a result of a [[rape]], can be subject to shame, ostracism or even an [[honor killing]]. In those cultures, female virginity is closely interwoven with personal or even family honor, especially those known as [[Shame society|shame societies]], in which the loss of virginity before marriage is a matter of deep shame. <ref name="Bennett">{{Cite book|author=Linda Rae Bennett|title=Women, Islam and modernity: single women, sexuality and reproductive health in contemporary Indonesia|publisher=Psychology Press|year = 2005 |accessdate=October 9, 2011|pages=183 pages |isbn=0-415-32929-9, 9780415329293|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JaA1kxjMebEC&pg=PA19&dq=male+virginity&hl=en&ei=86mRTq3YFKSGsALCpJnKAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=male%20virginity&f=false}}</ref> In other cultures, for example in many modern-day Western cultures, [[sexual abstinence]] before marriage is not taken as seriously as it is in those discussed above.  . 

Virginity is regarded as a valuable commodity in some cultures, and the right to have sexual intercourse with a virgin can be bought. For example, in Japan, [[geisha]]s would sell the right of first access in a ritual called ''[[mizuage]]''. There is also a legendary ''[[droit du seigneur]]'' ("the lord's right", often conflated with the Latin phrase "''ius primae noctis''") which alleged entitled the lord of an estate to take the virginity of the estate's virgins on the night of their marriage, a right which the lord can trade for money.  . 

It was the law and custom in some societies that required a man who seduced or raped a virgin to marry the girl or pay compensation to her father. <ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|22:16-17|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:28-29|NIV}}. See also [[Shotgun wedding]]. </ref> In some countries until the late 20th century, a woman could sue a man who had taken her virginity but did not marry her. In some languages, the compensation for these damages are called "[[wreath money]]". <ref>Brockhaus 2004, ''Kranzgeld''</ref> . 

====Proof of virginity====. 
{{main|Virginity test}}
Some cultures require proof of a bride's virginity prior to her marriage. This has traditionally been tested by the presence of an intact [[hymen]], which was verified by either a physical examination (usually by a physician, who provided a [[virginity test|certificate of virginity]]) or by a "proof of blood," which refers to vaginal bleeding that results from the tearing of the hymen. <ref name="Hymen">{{Cite book|last=Perlman |first=Sally E. |coauthors=Nakajyma, Steven T. and Hertweck, S.

Researchers stress that the presence or absence of a hymen is not a reliable indicator of whether or not a female has been vaginally penetrated. <ref name="Hymen"/> The hymen is a thin film of [[mucous membrane|membrane]] situated just inside the [[vulva]] which can partially occlude the entrance to the [[vaginal canal]]. It is flexible and can be stretched or torn during first engagement in vaginal intercourse. However, a hymen may also be broken during physical activity. Many women possess such thin, fragile hymens, easily stretched and already perforated at birth, that the hymen can be broken in childhood without the girl even being aware of it, often through athletic activities. A slip while riding a [[bicycle]] may on occasion result in the bicycle's saddle-horn entering the introitus just far enough to break the hymen. <ref>[http://www.studenthealth.co.uk/advice/advice.asp?adviceID=148 Torn hymen (virgin or not?)]</ref> Further, there is the case of women with damaged hymens undergoing [[hymenorrhaphy]] (or hymenoplasty) to repair or replace their hymens, and cause vaginal bleeding on the next intercourse as proof of virginity. <ref name="Regain"/> Others consider the practice to be [[virginity fraud]] or unnecessary.  . 

There is a common belief that some women are born without a hymen,<ref name=emans>Emans, S. Jean. "Physical Examination of the Child and Adolescent" (2000) in ''Evaluation of the Sexually Abused Child: A Medical Textbook and Photographic Atlas'', Second edition, Oxford University Press. 61-65</ref><ref name="McCann">McCann, J; Rosas, A. and Boos, S.

Some medical procedures, such as [[hymenotomy]], may require a woman's hymen to be opened.  . 

===Male virginity===. 
Historically, and in modern times, female virginity has been regarded as more significant than male virginity. The perception that sexual prowess is fundamental to masculinity has lowered the expectation of male virginity without lowering the social status. <ref name="Carpenter">{{Cite book|author=Laura M.

Females are more accepting of male virginity, but there exists negative feelings about the topic even among women. Reflective of the Guttmacher study, some women perceive men being virgins past their early twenties to be an undesirable trait and would decline marriage due to the man's sexual inexperience; in these cases, male virginity is considered to threaten the fantasy some women have about men knowing how to sexually please them. <ref name="Colón"/> . 

Within American culture in particular, male virginity has been made an object of embarrassment and ridicule in films such as ''[[Summer of '42]]'', ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' and ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]'', with the male virgin typically being presented as socially inept. <ref name="Carpenter"/><ref name="Leigh"/> However, some have challenged the negative connotations regarding male virginity, as well as the belief that males should want to lose their virginities at earlier ages than their female counterparts. <ref name="Asencio"/><ref name="Leigh"/><ref name="Evans">{{Cite book|authors=Ruth Evans, Sarah Salih, Anke Bernau|title=Medieval virginities.

While some writers and researchers argue that male virginity does not exist because there is nothing to identify male virginity, like there is in the case of hymens for females, others argue that it is no less valid since virginity can be subjective and is a matter of sexual experience. <ref name="Evans"/><ref name="Salih"/> .

The prevalence of virginity varies from culture to culture. In cultures which place importance on a female's virginity at marriage, the age at which virginity is loss is in effect determined by the age at which marriages would normally take place in those cultures, as well as the minimum [[Marriageable age|marriage age]] set by the laws of the country where the marriage takes place. In some cultures, a female is encouraged or required to marry at a very early age so that she will not have the opportunity to lose her virginity before marriage, or so that a girl can experience her sexuality from an early age. In some cultures, for example in many modern-day Western cultures, [[sexual abstinence]] before marriage is not valued, and in some cultures, abstention is discouraged.  . 

In a cross-cultural study, ''At what age do women and men have their first sexual intercourse?'' (2003), Michael Bozon of the French [[Institut national d'études démographiques]] found that contemporary cultures fall into three broad categories. <ref name="Bozon">Bozon, Michael. [http://www.ined.fr/fichier/t_telechargement/8633/telechargement_fichier_en_pesa391.pdf 'At what age do women and men have their first sexual intercourse? World comparisons and recent trends'.] ''Population and Societies'' '''391''' (2003) 1–4. </ref> In the first group, the data indicated families arranging marriage for daughters as close to puberty as possible with significantly older men. Age of men at sexual initiation in these societies is at later ages than that of women, but is often extra-marital. This group included [[sub-Saharan Africa]] (the study listed [[Mali]], [[Senegal]] and [[Ethiopia]]). The study considered the [[Indian subcontinent]] also fell into this group, although data was only available from [[Nepal]]. <ref name="Bozon"/> . 

In the second group, the data indicated families encouraged daughters to delay marriage, and to abstain from sexual activity prior to it. However, sons are encouraged to gain experience with older women or prostitutes prior to marriage. Age of men at sexual initiation in these societies is at lower ages than that of women. This group includes Latin cultures, both from [[southern Europe]] ([[Portugal]], [[Greece]] and [[Romania]] are noted) and from [[Latin America]] ([[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Dominican Republic]]). The study considered many Asian societies also fell into this group, although matching data were only available from [[Thailand]]. <ref name="Bozon"/> . 

In the third group, age of men and women at sexual initiation was more closely matched. There were two sub-groups, however. In non-Latin, Catholic countries ([[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]] are mentioned), age at sexual initiation was higher, suggesting later marriage and reciprocal valuing of male and female virginity. The same pattern of late marriage and reciprocal valuing of virginity was reflected in [[Singapore]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. The study considered [[China]] and [[Vietnam]] also fell into this group, although data were not available. <ref name="Bozon"/> . 

Finally, in northern and eastern European countries, age at sexual initiation was lower, with both men and women involved in sexual activity prior to any union formation. The study listed [[Switzerland]], Germany and the [[Czech Republic]] as members of this group. <ref name="Bozon"/> . 

According to a 2001 [[UNICEF]] survey, in 10 out of 12 developed nations with available data, more than two thirds of young people have had sexual intercourse while still in their teens. In Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Norway, the United Kingdom and the [[United States]], the proportion is over 80%. In Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, approximately 25% of 15 year olds and 50% of 17 year olds have had sex. <ref name=oecd >UNICEF.

The survey revealed that the majority of the students were still virgins (they had no experience of sexual intercourse), and, among those who were sexually active, the majority (82%) used contraception. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Godeau E, Nic Gabhainn S, Vignes C, Ross J, Boyce W, Todd J |title=Contraceptive use by 15-year-old students at their last sexual intercourse: results from 24 countries |journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med |volume=162 |issue=1 |pages=66–73 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18180415 |doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2007.8 |url=http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18180415}}</ref> In a 2005 [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] study of US teenagers, 29% of teens reported feeling pressure to have sex, 33% of sexually active teens reported "being in a relationship where they felt things were moving too fast sexually", and 24% had "done something sexual they didn’t really want to do". <ref name=kaiser>{{PDFlink|[http://www.kff.org/youthhivstds/upload/U-S-Teen-Sexual-Activity-Fact-Sheet.pdf U.S.Teen Sexual Activity]|147&nbsp;KB}} Kaiser Family Foundation, January 2005.

The increased sexual activity among adolescents is manifested in increased [[teenage pregnancies]] and an increase in [[sexually transmitted diseases]] (STDs). The rates of teenage pregnancy vary and range from 143 per 1000 girls in some sub-Saharan African countries to 2.9 per 1000 in South Korea. The rate for the United States is 52.1 per 1000, the highest in the developed world – and about four times the European Union average. <ref name=ncbi>{{cite journal |author=Treffers PE |title=[Teenage pregnancy, a worldwide problem] |language=Dutch; Flemish |journal=Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd |volume=147 |issue=47 |pages=2320–5 |year=2003 |month=November |pmid=14669537 }}</ref><ref name=oecd />  The teenage pregnancy rates between countries must take into account the level of general [[sex education]] available and access to contraceptive options. Many Western countries have instituted sex education programs, the main objective of which is to reduce such pregnancies and STDs. In 1996, the United States federal government shifted the objective of sex education towards "[[abstinence-only sex education]]" programs, promoting sexual abstinence before marriage (ie., virginity) and prohibiting information on birth control and contraception. In 2004, President [[George W. Bush]] announced a Five-Year Global [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] Strategy, also known as the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR),<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/29831.pdf|title = Organization|publisher = DoS}}</ref> which committed the U.S. to provide $15 billion over five years toward AIDS relief in 15 countries in [[Africa]] and the [[Caribbean]], and in [[Vietnam]]. <ref>The 15 countries are Botswana, Côte d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guyana, Haiti, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, and Zambia. </ref> A part of the funding was earmarked specifically for "abstinence-only-until-marriage" programs.  . 

In a peer-reviewed study about [[virginity pledge]]s (commitments made by teenagers and young adults to refrain from sexual intercourse until marriage), sociologists [[Peter Bearman]] of [[Columbia University|Columbia]] and Hannah Brueckner of [[Yale University|Yale]] estimated that male pledgers were 4.1 times more likely to remain virgins by age 25 than those who did not pledge (25% vs 6%), and estimated that female pledgers were 3.5 times more likely to remain virgins by age 25 than those who did not pledge (21% vs 6%). <ref name="webmdVPDCSR">{{cite web | title = Virginity Pledges Don't Cut STD Rates | work = WebMD.com | url=http://my.webmd.com/content/Article/102/106704.htm?}}</ref><ref name="promise">{{cite journal| url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T80-4FR4449-2&_coverDate=04%2F30%2F2005&_alid=381963963&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_qd=1&_cdi=5072&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000039639&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=709070&md5=b5fcf537cb8ea44e172641d8e4ef5884| title = After the promise: The STD consequences of adolescent virginity pledges| author =Brückner and Bearman| date = April| month = 2005| work = Journal of Adolescent Health| pages =271–278| volume= 36| issue= 4| doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2005.01.005| last2 = Bearman| first2 = Peter| journal = Journal of Adolescent Health| pmid = 15780782}}</ref> . 

===Social psychology===. 
Some [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] argue that [[romantic love]] and [[sexual jealousy]] are universal features of human relationships. <ref>[[Donald Brown (anthropologist)|Donald Brown]], ''[[Human Universals]]'', 1991. </ref> Social values related to virginity reflect both sexual jealousy and ideals of romantic love, and appear to be deeply embedded in human nature.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} . 

[[Psychology]] explores the connection between thought and behavior. Seeking understanding of social (or anti-social) behaviors includes sexual behavior. Joan Kahn and Kathryn London studied U.S. women married between 1965 and 1985 to see if virginity at marriage influenced risk of divorce. 
{{cquote|This article examines the relationship between premarital sexual activity and the long-term risk of divorce among U.S. women married between 1965 and 1985. Simple cross-tabulations from the 1988 National Survey of Family Growth indicate that women who were sexually active prior to marriage faced a considerably higher risk of marital disruption than women who were virgin brides. A bivariate probit model is employed to examine three possible explanations for this positive relationship: (a) a direct causal effect, (b) an indirect effect through intervening "high risk" behaviors (such as having a premarital birth or marrying at a young age), and (c) a selectivity effect representing prior differences between virgins and non-virgins (such as family background or attitudes and values). After a variety of observable characteristics are controlled, non-virgins still face a much higher risk of divorce than virgins. However, when the analysis controls for unobserved characteristics affecting both the likelihood of having premarital sex and the likelihood of divorce, the differential is no longer significant. These results suggest that the positive relationship between premarital sex and the risk of divorce can be attributed to prior unobserved differences (e.g., the willingness to break traditional norms) rather than to a direct causal effect. <ref>Joan R. Kahn, Kathryn A. London, [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0022-2445%28199111%2953%3A4%3C845%3APSATRO%3E2.0.CO%3B2-5&size=LARGE&origin=JSTOR-enlargePage 'Premarital Sex and the Risk of Divorce',] ''Journal of Marriage and the Family'' '''53''' (1991): 845-855. </ref>}}
This study makes no recommendation; it simply notes that the women most likely to exercise freedom to enter sexual relationships prior to marriage, overlap significantly with the women most likely to exercise freedom to leave a relationship after marriage. Men were not the subject of this study.  . 

==Sexual morality==. 
===Social norms===. 
{{Main|Sexual morality|Norm (sociology)}}
Each major religion has [[moral code]]s covering issues of sexuality, morality, ethics etc. (see below) Though these moral codes do not address issues of sexuality directly, they seek to regulate the situations which can give rise to sexual interest and to influence people's [[human sexual activities|sexual activities]] and practices. However, the impact of religious teaching has at times been limited. For example, though most religions disapprove of [[premarital sex|premarital sexual relations]], it has always been widely practiced. Nevertheless, these religious codes have always had a strong influence on peoples' attitudes to sexual issues.  . 

Human sexual activity, even among adolescents, like many other kinds of activity engaged in by humans, is generally influenced by social rules that are culturally specific and vary widely.  These social rules are referred to as sexual morality (what can and can not be done by society's rules) and sexual norms (what is and is not expected). There are a number of groups within societies promoting their views of sexual morality in a variety of ways, including through sex education, religious teachings, seeking commitments or virginity pledges, and other means.  . 

Most countries have laws which set a [[Marriageable age|minimum marriage age]], with the most common age being 18 years, but the actual [[age at first marriage]] can be considerably higher. Laws also prescribe the minimum age at which a person is permitted to engage in sex, commonly called the [[age of consent]]. Social (and the resulting legal) attitudes toward the appropriate age of consent have drifted upwards in modern times. For example, while ages from 10 to 13 were typically acceptable in [[western world|Western countries]] during the mid-19th century,<ref name="waites">{{cite book| last=Waites| first=Matthew| title=The Age of Consent: Young People, Sexuality and Citizenship| publisher=Palgrave Macmillan| year=2005| isbn=1-4039-2173-3| oclc=238887395 58604878}}</ref> the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century were marked by changing attitudes resulting in raising the ages of consent to ages generally ranging from 16 to&nbsp;18. <ref name="Stephen Robertson, University of Sydney, Australia">{{cite web|author=Stephen Robertson, University of Sydney, Australia |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/teaching-modules/230 |title=Children and Youth in History &#124; Age of Consent Laws |publisher=Chnm.gmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref> Today, the age of consent varies from 12 years (or onset of puberty) to 21, but 16 to 18 is the most common range of ages of consent, but some jurisdictions also have a "close-in-age" exception, allowing two adolescents (as young as 12 years of age) to have sex with each other provided their ages are not more than 2 years apart. For the average age at which adolescents have their first sexual experience, see "Prevalence of virginity" above. Some countries outlaw any sex outside marriage entirely.  . 

===Religious views===. 
{{Main|Religion and sexuality}} . 

====Buddhism====. 
See [[Sexual abstinence]] . 

====Hinduism====. 
For most of the history of Hinduism, ''premarital'' virginity on the part of the bride was ideal- as it is today. <ref name=hindu>{{cite book|last=Lipner|first=Julius|title=Hindus: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-05182-7, 9780415051828|pages=375 pages,see:268}}</ref> The prevailing Hindu marriage ceremony or the [[Vedic wedding]], centers around the ''[[Kanyadan]]'' ritual, which literally means ''gift of a virgin,'' by father of the maiden through which the Hindus believe they gain greatest spiritual merit, and marriages of the daughters are considered a spiritual obligation. <ref name=marriage>{{cite book|last=Ramusack, Sharon|first=Barbara N,L.

However, in ancient India, virginity was not specially esteemed in the Hindu social system. On the contrary, it was believed that a virgin can never attain spiritual enlightenment. Sex had never been a taboo in ancient India and intactness of the hymen had nothing to do with virginity. <ref name=ero>{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Benjamin|title=The Hindu world: an encyclopedic survey of Hinduism, Volume 2 The Hindu World: An Encyclopedic Survey of Hinduism, Benjamin Walke|year=1968|publisher=Praeger,|pages=571-572}}</ref> But these rules were not applicable to women of elite birth.  . 

The worship of virgins, ie.''Kumarika pujan,'' is still observed by many Hindus. <ref name=worship>{{cite book|last= Kapoor |first=Subodh |title= The Indian Encyclopaedia, Volume 1|year=2002|publisher= Genesis Publishing Pvt Ltd |isbn= 81-7755-257-0, 9788177552577 Length|pages= 8250 pages}}</ref> . 

====Judaism====. 
In Judaism, sex is not considered to be sinful. Though premarital sex is disapproved, there is no requirement for a female to be a virgin at her marriage, and a child born to an unmarried female is not regarded as illegitimate ([[mamzer]]) or subject to any social or religious disabilities.  . 

Sex within marriage is considered a virtue (''[[mitzvah]]'', literally a 'commandment'). Jewish law contains rules related to protecting female virgins and dealing with consensual and non-consensual pre-marital sex. The thrust of Jewish law's guidance on sex is effectively that it should not be rejected, but should be lived as a wholesome part of life.  . 

====Greece and Rome====. 
Virginity was often considered a virtue denoting purity and physical self-restraint and is an important characteristic in [[Greek mythology]].  . 

In Roman times, [[Vestal Virgin]]s were strictly celibate priestesses of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]]. They were brought to the temple before puberty and were required to remain celibate for 30 years, on penalty of death. <ref>[http://www.stoa.org/diotima/anthology/wlgr/wlgr-religion408.shtml "Life of Numa Pompilius", Plutarch, 9.5–10, 2nd century A.D]</ref> In the documentary, ''What is a Virgin?'' it is mentioned that the vestal's virginity was more important for the state than to herself, because the sacred fire that they attended could not be allowed to go out. If a vestal virgin was found having sexual relations she would be buried alive. <ref>[What is a Virgin?c.20083FatesFilms www.whatisavirgin.com What is a virgin?]</ref> . 

====Christianity====. 
[[File:Giorgione 045.jpg|thumb|right|250pxl|Detail of ''The Reading Madonna'' by [[Giorgione]] (c. 1500) ]]
[[Paul the Apostle]] expressed the view that a person's body belongs to God and is God's temple ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|6:13|NIV}}, {{bibleverse-nb|1|Corinthians|3:16|NIV}}) and that premarital sex is sexual immorality and [[fornication]], and is sinful ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|6:18|NIV}}), on an equal level as adultery. ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|6:9|NIV}}) Paul also expressed the view in {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|7:1-7|NIV}} that sexual abstinence is the preferred state for both men and women. However, recognizing human weakness in matters of sexuality, he countenanced sexual relations, but only between marriage partners within marriage, with premarital and extramarital sex not allowed.  . 

According to classicist [[Evelyn Stagg]] and New Testament scholar [[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Frank Stagg]], the New Testament holds that sex is reserved for marriage. <ref name="Staggs">Stagg, Evelyn and Frank. ''Woman in the World of Jesus.'' Philadelphia: Westminster, 1978. ISBN 0-664-24195-6</ref> They maintain that the New Testament teaches that sex outside of marriage is a sin of [[adultery]] if either sexual participant is married, otherwise the sin of [[Porneia|fornication]] if both sexual participants are unmarried. An imperative given in 1&nbsp;Corinthians says, "Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins people commit are outside their bodies, but those who sin sexually sin against their own bodies."{{Bibleref2c|1Co|6:18|TNIV|1 Cor 6:18}} Those who are sexually immoral or adulterers are listed in {{Bibleref2|1Cor|6:9|NIV|1&nbsp;Corinthians 6:9}} in a list of "wrongdoers who...will not inherit the kingdom of God." {{Bibleref2|Galatians|5:19}} and {{Bibleref2|1Cor|7:2|NIV|1&nbsp;Corinthians 7:2}} also address ''fornication''. The ''Apostolic Decree'' of the [[Council of Jerusalem]] also includes a prohibition of ''fornication''.  . 

[[Aquinas]] went further, emphasizing that acts other than copulation destroy virginity, but also clarifying that involuntary sexual pleasure or pollution does not destroy virginity says in his [[Summa Theologica]], "Pleasure resulting from resolution of semen may arise in two ways. If this be the result of the mind's purpose, it destroys virginity, ''whether copulation takes place or not''. Augustine, however, mentions copulation, because such like resolution is the ordinary and natural result thereof. On another way this may happen beside the purpose of the mind, either during sleep, or through violence and without the mind's consent, although the flesh derives pleasure from it, or again through weakness of nature, as in the case of those who are subject to a flow of semen. On such cases virginity is not forfeit, because such like pollution is not the result of impurity which excludes virginity."<ref>Aquinas. [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3152.htm Summa Theologica], Second Part of the Second Part, Question 152. </ref><ref>Hannah Blank, ''Virgin: The Untouched History'' (2007), ISBN 978-1-59691-010-2. </ref> . 

Some have theorized that the New Testament was not against sex before marriage. <ref>[[John Shelby Spong]], ''The Living Commandments''. </ref> The discussion turns on two Greek words — ''moicheia'' (μοιχεία, adultery) and ''porneia'' ([[:el:πορνεία]], [[fornication]] see also [[pornography]]). The first word is restricted to contexts involving sexual betrayal of a spouse, however the second word is used as a generic term for illegitimate sexual activity. Elsewhere in {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|}}, incest, homosexual intercourse (according to some interpretations)<ref>

and prostitution are all explicitly forbidden by name. Paul is preaching about activities based on [[Leviticus|levitical]] sexual prohibitions in the context of achieving holiness. The theory suggests it is these, and only these behaviours that are intended by Paul's prohibition in chapter seven. <ref>[http://orion.mscc.huji.ac.il/symposiums/11th/papers/FrommHoliness.doc Syriac- Christian and Rabbinic Notions of Holy Community and Sexuality] Naomi Koltun-Fromm April 2006 pdf</ref> The strongest argument against this theory is that the modern interpretation of the New Testament, outside Corinthians, speaks against premarital sex;<ref>Modern interpretation of the significance of "wrong his brother" in {{bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|4:6|NIV}}, includes sleeping with the brother's future wife.

Christian orthodoxy accepts that [[Mary, the mother of Jesus]], was a virgin at the time Jesus was conceived, based on the accounts in the gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]. <ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|1:18|NIV}} and {{bibleverse||Luke|1:26-35|NIV}}</ref> The [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], and [[Oriental Orthodox]] [[Christian denomination|denomination]]s, additionally hold to the [[dogma]] of the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]]. <ref name=MWebster >''Merriam-Webster's encyclopedia of world religions'' by Merriam-Webster, Inc. 1999 ISBN 0-87779-044-2 page 1134</ref><ref>''[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1K.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church'' §499]</ref><ref>[http://www.ocf.org/OrthodoxPage/liturgy/liturgy.html Divine Liturgy of St John Chrysostom], [http://www.coptic.net/prayers/StBasilLiturgy.html Coptic Liturgy of St Basil], [http://www.copticchurch.net/topics/liturgy/liturgy_of_st_cyril.pdf Liturgy of St Cyril], [http://web.ukonline.co.uk/ephrem/lit-james.htm Liturgy of St James], [http://www.frmichel.najim.net/liturgyvid.pdf Understanding the Orthodox Liturgy] etc. </ref> However, most Protestants reject the dogma, citing sources such as {{bibleverse||Mark|6:3|NIV}}: "Isn't this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? And aren't His sisters here with us?". The Catholic Church holds<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PW8.HTM#$3DY New American Bible]</ref> that in Semitic usage the terms "brother," "sister" are applied not only to children of the same parents, but to nephews, nieces, cousins, half-brothers, and half-sisters. Catholics, Orthodox Christians and other groups may refer to Mary as the Virgin Mary or the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]].  . 

There are references to virginity in [[Book of Genesis]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. In the first reference, in {{bibleverse||Genesis|19:8|HE}}, Lot offers his virgin daughters to the people of Sodom for undetermined sexual purposes in an attempt to protect his guests, with the implication that the people of Sodom would be more likely to accept the offer in view of the girls' virginity than they would otherwise. The next reference is at {{bibleverse||Genesis|24:16|HE}}, where [[Eliezer]] is seeking a wife for his master, Abraham's son. He meets [[Rebecca|Rebekah]], and the narrative tells us, "the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her" (in biblical terms, "to know" is a euphemism for sexual relations). It is noteworthy that Eliezer was not instructed to find a virgin bride, nor is anything further said about the prospective bride's virgin status. {{bibleverse||Exodus|22:16-17|NIV}} and {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:28-29|NIV}} deal with the requirement for a man who seduces or rapes a virgin to marry her and pay a bride price at the virgin rate, which presumably is higher than that for a non-virgin.  . 

Virginity is a recurring theme in the Bible — the nation is frequently personified as "the virgin daughter of Israel" in the prophetic poetry. It is a wistful phrase, since Genesis also says that Israel's ([[Jacob]]'s) only daughter [[Dinah]] was, in fact, raped as she entered the promised land. The [[Torah]] also contains laws governing betrothal, marriage and divorce, with particular provisions regarding virginity in {{bibleverse-lb||Deuteronomy|22}}.  . 

=====Catholic view=====. 
[[File:Virgo inter Virgines IMG 1383.JPG|thumb|''Virgo inter Virgines'' (The Blessed virgin Mary with other holy virgins), anonymous, [[Bruges]], last quarter of the 15th Century.]]
The Catholic Encyclopedia says: "There are two elements in virginity: the material element, that is to say, the absence, in the past and in the present, of all complete and voluntary delectation, whether from [[lust]] or from the lawful use of marriage; and the formal element, that is the firm resolution to abstain forever from sexual pleasure." And, "Virginity is irreparably lost by sexual pleasure, voluntarily and completely experienced."<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15458a.htm The Catholic Encyclopedia, 'Virginity']</ref> However, for the purposes of [[consecrated virgins]] it is canonically enough that they have never been married or lived in open violation of chastity.  . 

=====Christian Mysticism and Gnostic Christianity=====. 
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}
In [[Christian mysticism]], [[Gnosticism]], as well as some [[Hellenistic religion]]s, there is a [[female]] [[spirit]] or goddess named [[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]] that is said to embody [[wisdom]] and who is sometimes described as a virgin.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} In [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] mysticism, [[Hildegard of Bingen]] celebrated Sophia as a cosmic figure both in her writing and art. Within the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] tradition in England, 17th Century Christian Mystic, [[Christian universalism|Universalist]] and founder of the Philadelphian Society [[Jane Leade]] wrote copious descriptions of her visions and dialogues with the "Virgin Sophia" who, she said, revealed to her the spiritual workings of the Universe. Leade was hugely influenced by the theosophical writings of 16th Century [[Germany|German]] Christian mystic [[Jakob Böhme]], who also speaks of the Sophia in works such as ''The Way to Christ''. <ref>[http://www.passtheword.org/DIALOGS-FROM-THE-PAST/waychrst.htm Passtheword.org]</ref> Jakob Böhme was very influential to a number of Christian mystics and religious leaders, including [[George Rapp]] and the [[Harmony Society]]. The Harmony Society was a religious [[Pietism|pietist]] group that lived [[Commune (intentional community)|communally]], were [[Pacifism|pacifistic]], and advocated [[celibacy]] among its membership.  . 

====Islam====. 
{{See also|Zina}} . 

[[Islam]] considers premarital sex to be sinful, though of a lesser quality than [[adultery]]. Most forms of sexual contact within marriage are permissible.  .
