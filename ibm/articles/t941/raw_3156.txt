'''Harm reduction''' (or less commonly known as '''harm minimisation''') refers to a range of [[public health]] policies designed to reduce the harmful consequences associated with [[recreational drug use]] and other high risk activities. Harm reduction is put forward as a useful perspective alongside the more conventional approaches of [[Demand reduction|demand]] and [[supply reduction]]. <ref name="marlatt">{{cite book |last=Marlatt |first=G.

Many advocates argue that prohibitionist laws criminalise people for suffering from a disease and cause harm, for example by obliging drug addicts to obtain drugs of unknown purity from unreliable criminal sources at high prices, increasing the risk of [[overdose]] and death. <ref>{{cite book |first1=James A. |last1=Inciardi |first2=Lana D. |last2=Harrison |year=2000 |title=Harm reduction: national and international perspectives |location=Thousand Oaks, California |publisher=SAGE |pages=vii–viii}}</ref> Its critics are concerned that tolerating risky or illegal behaviour sends a message to the community that these behaviours are acceptable. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.incb.org/pdf/e/ar/2001/incb_report_2001_3_oceania.pdf |title=INCB 2001 Annual Report - Oceania |accessdate=2010-03-28 |page=559 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-17571220.html |title=Anger as Vice Girls Get Free Condoms |accessdate=2010-04-20 }}</ref> .

=== Heroin maintenance programmes ===. 
{{Main|Heroin assisted treatment}}
Providing a medical prescription for pharmaceutical heroin (diamorphine) to heroin addicts has been seen in some countries as a way of solving the 'heroin problem' with potential benefits to the individual addict and to society. The treatment greatly improves the social and health situation of patients, while reducing costs incurred by delinquency, criminal trials, incarceration and health interventions. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/37/1/parlbus/commbus/senate/Com-e/ille-e/presentation-e/ucht-e.htm |title=Background |work=Heroin Assisted Treatment for Opiate Addicts – The Swiss Experience |first=Ambros |last=Uchtenhagen |month=February |year=2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Haasen C, Verthein U, Degkwitz P, Berger J, Krausz M, Naber D |title=Heroin-assisted treatment for opioid dependence: randomised controlled trial |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=191 |issue= |pages=55–62 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17602126 |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.106.026112}}</ref> . 

In Switzerland, [[heroin assisted treatment]] is fully a part of the national health programme. There are several dozen centers throughout the country at which heroin-dependent people can receive heroin in a controlled environment. The Swiss heroin maintenance programme is generally regarded as a successful and valuable component of the country's overall approach to minimising the harms caused by drug use. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/37/1/parlbus/commbus/senate/Com-e/ille-e/presentation-e/ucht-e.htm |title=Epidemiology |work=Heroin Assisted Treatment for Opiate Addicts – The Swiss Experience |first=Ambros |last=Uchtenhagen |month=February |year=2002}}</ref> In a 2008 [[Swiss referendum, November 2008#Revision_of_the_federal_statute_on_narcotics|national referendum]] a majority of 68% voted in favor of continuing the programme. <ref>http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/front/Swiss_to_agree_heroin_scheme_but_say_no_to_dope.html?siteSect=105&sid=10032560</ref> .

The British have had a system of heroin maintenance since the 1920s. Drug addiction was seen as an individual health problem in Britain; drug addiction to opiates was rare in the 1920s and mostly limited to middle class people who had easy access to opiates due to their profession, or people who had become addicted as a side effect of medical treatment. In the 1950s and 1960s a small number of doctors contributed, through legal prescribing of excessive quantities of addictive drugs, to the alarming increase of drug addicts in the U.K. This gave the method a bad reputation and the U.K. switched to a more restrictive drug law. <ref name="rachel">[http://www.drugtext.org/library/articles/92333.html Rachel Lart BRITISH MEDICAL PERCEPTION FROM ROLLESTON TO BRAIN, CHANGING IMAGES OF THE ADDICT AND ADDICTION]</ref> However, in recent years the British are moving again toward heroin as a legitimate component of their National Health Service. This is because evidence is clear that methadone maintenance is not the answer for all opioid addicts and that heroin is a viable maintenance drug which has shown equal or better rates of success in terms of assisting long-term users establish stable, crime-free lives. <ref>Access a British report on heroin maintenance entitled [http://www.jrf.org.uk/knowledge/findings/socialpolicy/943.asp Prescribing Heroin: what is the evidence?]</ref> A Norwegian government appointed committee gave an evaluation of internationally available research reports on maintenance treatment with heroin concluded, in 2011, that there are so many uncertainties and knowledge gaps about the effects of heroin treatment that they would not recommend the introduction of maintenance treatment with heroin in Norway. <ref>[http://www.forskningsradet.no/no/Nyheter/_For_svakt_grunnlag/1253968771212?WT.ac=forside_nyhet Norges forskningsråd:For svakt grunnlag,01.09.2011]</ref> . 

The first, and only, North American [[heroin maintenance]] project is being run in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia|B.C.]] and [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. Currently, over 80 long-term [[heroin]] addicts who have not been helped by available treatment options are taking part in the [[North American Opiate Medication Initiative]] (NAOMI) trials. However, critics have alleged that the control group gets unsustainably low doses of methadone, making them prone to fail and thus rigging the results in favor of heroin maintenance. <ref>{{cite journal |pmc=1780152 |title=Why we object to NAOMI: Heroin maintenance in Canada | pmid=16812955 |year=2006 |last1=Kahan |first1=M |last2=Srivastava |first2=A |last3=Shen |first3=K |volume=52 |pages=705–6, 709–11 |journal=Canadian family physician Medecin de famille canadien |issue=6}}</ref> . 

Critics of heroin maintenance programmes object to the high costs of providing heroin to users. The British heroin study cost the British government £15,000 per participant per year, roughly equivalent to average heroin user's expense of £15,600 per year. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.actiononaddiction.org.uk/news_and_campaigns/news/160_untreatable-or-just-hard-to-treat |title=Treatable or Just Hard to Treat? |accessdate=2011-01-08}} 2009</ref> Drug Free Australia<ref name="DrugFreeAustralia">Drug Free Australia {{Cite web|url= http://www.drugfree.org.au/fileadmin/Media/Global/Taskforce_Arguments_for_Prohibition.pdf |title=Arguments for Prohibition |accessdate=2010-04-20 }}p 3</ref> contrast these ongoing maintenance costs with Sweden's investment in, and commitment to, a drug free society where a policy of compulsory rehabilitation of drug addicts is integral, which has yielded the lowest illicit drug use levels in the developed world,<ref>UNODC {{cite web |url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/WDR-2000.html |title= World Drug Report 2000 |accessdate=2010-05-04}} 2001 pp 162-165 (see aggregated average for each OECD country in Harm Reduction Discussion page). </ref> a model in which rehabilitated users present no further maintenance costs to their community, as well as reduced ongoing health care costs. <ref name="DrugFreeAustralia" /> .

=== Needle exchange programmes ===. 
[[File:800px-Caernarfon womens toilets.jpg|thumb|A [[bin]] allowing for safe disposal of [[syringe|needle]]s in a [[washroom|public toilet]] in [[Caernarfon]], [[Wales]].]]
{{Main|Needle-exchange programme}}
The use of some illicit drugs can involve hypodermic needles. In some areas (notably in many parts of the US), these are available solely by prescription. Where availability is limited, users of heroin and other drugs frequently share the syringes and use them more than once. As a result infections such as [[HIV]] or [[hepatitis C]] can spread from user to users through the reuse of syringes contaminated with infected blood. The principles of harm reduction propose that syringes should be easily available or at least available through a needle and syringe programmes (NSP). Where syringes are provided in sufficient quantities, rates of HIV are much lower than in places where supply is restricted. In many countries users are supplied equipment free of charge, others require payment or an exchange of dirty needles for clean ones, hence the name.  . 

A 2010 review found insufficient evidence that NSP prevents transmission of the hepatitis C virus, tentative evidence that it prevents transmission of HIV and sufficient evidence that it reduces self-reported injecting risk behaviour. <ref name="pmid20219055">{{cite journal |author=Palmateer N, Kimber J, Hickman M, Hutchinson S, Rhodes T, Goldberg D |title=Evidence for the effectiveness of sterile injecting equipment provision in preventing hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus transmission among injecting drug users: a review of reviews |journal=Addiction |volume=105 |issue=5 |pages=844–59 |year=2010 |month=May |pmid=20219055 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02888.x}}</ref> It has been shown in the many evaluations of needle-exchange programmes that in areas where clean syringes are more available, illegal drug use is no higher than in other areas.

{{Main|Safe injection site}}
''Safe injection sites'' (SIS), or ''Drug consumption rooms'' (DCR), are legally sanctioned, medically supervised facilities designed to address public nuisance associated with drug use and provide a hygienic and stress-free environment for drug consumers.  . 

The facilities provide sterile injection equipment, information about drugs and basic health care, treatment referrals, and access to medical staff. Some offer counseling, hygienic and other services of use to itinerant and impoverished individuals. Most programmes prohibit the sale or purchase of illegal drugs. Many require identification cards. Some restrict access to local residents and apply other admission criteria, such as they have to be injection drug users, but generally in Europe they don't exclude addicts who consume by other means.  . 

The Netherlands had the first staffed injection room, although they did not operate under explicit legal support until 1996. Instead, the first center where it was legal to inject drug was in Berne, Switzerland, opened 1986. In 1994, Germany opened its first site. Although, as in the Netherlands they operated in a "gray area", supported by the local authorities and with consent from the police until the Bundestag provided a legal exemption in 2000. <ref name=dolan>{{cite journal | url=http://www.drugpolicy.org/docUploads/harm_reduction_digest_injecting_centres.pdf |last1= Dolan |first1= Kate |last2=Kimber |first2= Jo |last3=Fry |first3= Craig |last4= Fitzgerald |first4= John |last5= Mcdonald |first5= David |last6= Trautman |first6= Franz |year= 2000 |title = Drug consumption facilities in Europe and the establishment of supervised injection centres in Australia | journal = Drug and Alcohol Review | volume = 19 | pages = 337–346 | doi = 10.1080/713659379 | issue=3 }}</ref> .

Concluding that this "leaves the door open for alternative interpretations of data produced and subsequent ideological debate."<ref>{{harvnb|EMCDDA|2010}} {{cite web |url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_101267_EN_emcdda-harm%20red-mon-ch4-web.pdf |title=Chapter 4: Perspectives on harm reduction — what experts have to say |author=Rehm J, ''et al'' |format=PDF}}</ref> . 

The EMCDDA review noted that research into the effects of the facilities "faces methodological challenges in taking account of the effects of broader local policy or ecological changes", still they concluded "that the facilities reach their target population and provide immediate improvements through better hygiene and safety conditions for injectors." Further that the facilitates "does not increase levels of drug use or risky patterns of consumption, nor does it result in higher rates of local drug acquisition crime." While its usage is "associated with self-reported reductions in injecting risk behaviour such as syringe sharing, and in public drug use" and "with increased uptake of [[Drug detoxification|detoxification]] and [[Drug rehabilitation|treatment services]]."<ref name=emcdda-dcr /> However, "a lack of studies, as well as methodological problems such as isolating the effect from other interventions or low coverage of the risk population, evidence regarding DCRs — while encouraging — is insufficient for drawing conclusions with regard to their effectiveness in reducing [[HIV]] or [[hepatitis C]] virus (HCV) incidence." Concluding with that "there is suggestive evidence from modelling studies that they may contribute to reducing drug-related deaths at a city level where coverage is adequate, the review-level evidence of this effect is still insufficient."<ref name=emcdda-dcr /> .

=== Cannabis ===. 
{{See|Legal issues of cannabis|Health issues and the effects of cannabis|Removal of cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act|Drug policy of the Netherlands}} . 

Specific harms associated with cannabis include increased accident-rate while [[Effects of cannabis#Effects on driving|driving under intoxication]], [[Cannabis dependence|dependence]], [[Long-term effects of cannabis#Psychosis|psychosis]], detrimental psychosocial outcomes for adolescent users and [[Cannabis-associated respiratory disease|respiratory disease]]. <ref name=emcdda-cannabis>{{harvnb|EMCDDA|2010}} {{cite web |url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_101262_EN_emcdda-harm%20red-mon-ch8-web.pdf |title=Chapter 8: Harm reduction policies for cannabis |author= Hall W, Fischer B |format=PDF}}</ref> Strategies recommended by the [[European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction]] (EMCDDA) to deal with those include roadside drug-testing to deter intoxicated driving and education about patterns of use that increases the risk for dependence, mental health and respiratory problems. <ref name=emcdda-cannabis /> . 

The fact that cannabis possession carries prison sentences in most developed countries—although rarely imposed—is also pointed out as a problem by EMCDDA, as the consequences of a conviction for otherwise law abiding users arguably is more harmful than any harm from the drug itself. For example by adversely affecting professional or travel opportunities and straining personal relationships. <ref name=emcdda-cannabis /> Some people like Ethan Nadelmann of the Drug Policy Alliance{{Who|date=April 2011}} have suggested that organised marijuana legalization would encourage safe use and reveal the factual adverse effects from exposure to this herbs individual chemicals.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} . 

The way the laws concerning cannabis are enforced is also very selective, even discriminatory. Statistics show that the socially disadvantaged, immigrants and ethnic minorities have significantly higher arrest rates. <ref name=emcdda-cannabis /> Drug [[decriminalisation]], such as allowing the possession of small amounts of cannabis and possibly its cultivation for personal use, would alleviate these harms. <ref name=emcdda-cannabis /> Where decriminalisation has been implemented, such as in several states in [[Australia]] and [[United States]], as well as in [[Portugal]] and the [[Netherlands]] no, or only very small adverse effects have been shown on population cannabis usage rate. <ref name=emcdda-cannabis /> The lack of evidence of increased use indicates that such a policy shift does not have adverse effects on cannabis-related harm while, at the same time, decreasing enforcement costs. <ref name=emcdda-cannabis /> . 

In the last few years certain strains of [[cannabis]] with higher concentrations of [[THC]] and [[drug tourism]] have challenged the former policy in the Netherlands and led to a more restrictive approach; for example, a ban on selling cannabis to tourists in [[Cannabis coffee shop|coffeeshops]] suggested to start late 2011. <ref>{{cite news

===Alcohol===. 
Traditionally, [[homeless shelter]]s ban alcohol. In 1997, as the result of an [[inquest]] into the deaths of two homeless alcoholics two years earlier, [[Toronto]]'s [[Seaton House]] became the first homeless shelter in Canada to operate a "wet shelter" on a "managed alcohol" principle in which clients are served a glass of wine once an hour unless staff determine that they are too inebriated to continue. Previously, homeless alcoholics opted to stay on the streets often seeking alcohol from unsafe sources such as mouthwash, rubbing alcohol or industrial products which, in turn, resulted in frequent use of emergency medical facilities. The programme has been duplicated in other Canadian cities and a study of [[Ottawa]]'s "wet shelter" found that emergency room visit and police encounters by clients were cut by half. <ref>{{cite news |author=McKeen, Scott |title='Wet' shelter needs political will: Toronto project could serve as model for Edmonton |work=Edmonton Journal |date=March 7, 2007}}</ref> The study, published in the ''[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]]'' in 2006 found that serving chronic street alcoholics controlled doses of alcohol also reduced their overall alcohol consumption. Researchers found that programme participants cut their alcohol use from an average of 46 drinks a day when they entered the programme to an average of 8 drinks and that their visits to [[emergency room]]s drop to an average of eight a month from 13.5 while encounters with the police fall to an average of 8.8 from 18.1. <ref>{{cite news |author=Patrick, Kelly |title=The drinks are on us at the homeless shelter: Served every 90 minutes: Managed alcohol program reduces drinking |work=National Post |date=January 7, 2006 }}</ref> . 

[http://www.desc.org/supportive_housing.html Downtown Emergency Service Center](DESC), in Seattle Washington, operates several [[Housing First]], harm reduction model, programmes. University of Washington researchers, partnering with DESC, found that providing housing and support services for homeless alcoholics costs tax-payers less than leaving them on the street, where tax-payer money goes towards police and emergency health care. Results of the study funded by the Substance Abuse Policy Research Program (SAPRP) of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation<ref name="SAPRPpressRelease">{{cite web |url= http://www.saprp.org/m_pr_archives_detail.cfm?AppID=3836|title= SAPRP Project: Housing First: Evaluation of Harm Reduction Housing for Chronic Public Inebriates|work= SAPRP|date= April, 2009}}</ref> appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association April, 2009. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Larimer ME, Malone DK, Garner MD, ''et al.'' |title=Health care and public service use and costs before and after provision of housing for chronically homeless persons with severe alcohol problems |journal=JAMA |volume=301 |issue=13 |pages=1349–57 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19336710 |doi=10.1001/jama.2009.414 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/301/13/1349}}</ref> This first US controlled assessment of the effectiveness of Housing First specifically targeting chronically homeless alcoholics showed that the programme saved tax-payers more than $4 million over the first year of operation. During the first six-months, even after considering the cost of administering the housing, 95 residents in a Housing First programme in downtown Seattle, the study reported an average cost-savings of 53 percent—nearly US $2,500 per month per person in health and social services, compared to the per month costs of a wait-list control group of 39 homeless people. Further, despite the fact residents are not required to be abstinent or in treatment for alcohol use, stable housing also results in reduced drinking among homeless alcoholics.  . 

=== Alcohol-related programmes === . 

A high amount of media coverage exists informing users of the dangers of [[drunk driving|driving drunk]]. Most alcohol users are now aware of these dangers and safe ride techniques like '[[designated driver]]s' and free taxicab programmes are reducing the number of drunk-driving accidents. Many cities have free-ride-home programmes during holidays involving high alcohol abuse, and some bars and clubs will provide a visibly drunk patron with a free cab ride.  . 

In [[New South Wales]] groups of licensees have formed local liquor accords and collectively developed, implemented and promoted a range of harm minimisation programmes including the aforementioned 'designated driver' and 'late night patron transport' schemes. Many of the transport schemes are free of charge to patrons, to encourage them to avoid drink-driving and at the same time reduce the impact of noisy patrons loitering around late night venues.  . 

[[Moderation Management]] is a programme which helps drinkers to cut back on their consumption of alcohol by encouraging safe drinking behaviour.  . 

The HAMS Harm Reduction Network is a programme which encourages any positive change with regard to the use of alcohol or other mood altering substances. HAMS encourages goals of safer drinking, reduced drinking, moderate drinking, or abstinence. The choice of the goal is up to the individual.  . 

Harm reduction in alcohol dependency could be instituted by use of naltrexone, in a treatment developed by Professor Sinclair. The aim is to take naltrexone daily before having alcohol and reduce the endorphin reward caused (it is an opiate antagonist) leading to more moderate intake and the possibility of replacing alcohol with healthy endorphin-releasing activities on non-drinking days. Research suggests 60-80% of people completing 3 months of treatment reduce their intake to <24 units a week by the end.  . 

=== Tobacco ===. 
{{Main|Tobacco harm reduction}}
Tobacco harm reduction describes actions taken to lower the health risks associated with using tobacco, especially combustible forms, without abstaining completely from tobacco and nicotine. These measures include: . 

*Smoking safer cigarettes
*Switching to Swedish or American smokeless tobacco products
*Switching to non-tobacco nicotine delivery systems . 

It is widely acknowledged that discontinuation of all tobacco products confers the greatest lowering of risk. However, there is a considerable population of inveterate smokers who are unable or unwilling to achieve abstinence. Harm reduction may be of substantial benefit to these individuals.  . 

== Sex ==. 
=== Safer sex programmes === . 

Many schools now provide [[safer sex]] education to teen and pre-teen students, some of whom engage in sexual activity. Given the premise that some adolescents are going to have sex, a harm-reductionist approach supports a sexual education which emphasizes the use of protective devices like [[condoms]] and [[dental dam]]s to protect against unwanted pregnancy and the transmission of [[sexually transmitted infections|STI]]s. This runs contrary to the ideology of [[sexual abstinence|abstinence]]-only sex education, which holds that educating children about sex can encourage them to engage in it.  . 

These programmes have been found to decrease risky sexual behaviour and prevent [[sexually transmitted diseases]]. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=BT|coauthors=Scott-Sheldon, LA, Huedo-Medina, TB, Carey, MP|title=Interventions to reduce sexual risk for human immunodeficiency virus in adolescents: a meta-analysis of trials, 1985-2008|journal=Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine|date=2011 Jan|volume=165|issue=1|pages=77–84|pmid=21199984|doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2010.251}}</ref> They also reduce rates of unwanted pregnancies. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Oringanje|first=C|coauthors=Meremikwu, MM, Eko, H, Esu, E, Meremikwu, A, Ehiri, JE|title=Interventions for preventing unintended pregnancies among adolescents|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2009-10-07|issue=4|pages=CD005215|pmid=19821341|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005215.pub2|editor1-last=Oringanje|editor1-first=Chioma}}</ref> [[Abstinence only]] programmes, however, do not appear to affect HIV risks in developed countries with no evidence available for other areas. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Underhill|first=K|coauthors=Operario, D, Montgomery, P|title=Abstinence-only programs for HIV infection prevention in high-income countries|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2007-10-17|issue=4|pages=CD005421|pmid=17943855|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005421.pub2|editor1-last=Operario|editor1-first=Don}}</ref> . 

=== Legalized prostitution ===. 
{{Main|Legality of prostitution}} . 

Since 1999 some countries have legalized prostitution, such as [[Prostitution in Germany|Germany]] (2002) and [[Prostitution in New Zealand|New Zealand]] (2003). Those who support the prohibition of the sex trade also say that legalized prostitution does nothing to improve the situation of the prostitutes and leads only to an increase in criminal activities and [[human trafficking]]. For example, [[Netherlands]], a country which has legal and regulated prostitution, has severe problems with [[human trafficking]] (it is listed by [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|UNODC]] as a top destination for victims of human trafficking<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6497799.stm | work=BBC News | title=UN highlights human trafficking | date=2007-03-26 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}</ref>), and, in response to these problems has decided in 2009, to close 320 prostitution "windows",<ref>{{cite web |author=Stuijt A |date=2009-01-19 |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/265520 |title=Amsterdam courts ready to clean up red light district |work=DIGITAL JOURNAL }}</ref> after having closed numerous other prostitution business during the past years. The mayor of [[Amsterdam]], [[Job Cohen]] said about legal prostitution in his city: "We've realized this is no longer about small-scale entrepreneurs, but that big crime organisations are involved here in trafficking women, drugs, killings and other criminal activities". <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/world/europe/24amsterdam.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | title=Amsterdam Tries Upscale Fix for Red-Light District Crime | first=Marlise | last=Simons | date=2008-02-24 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}</ref> Ever since the 90's there has been a steady increase in the number of trafficking victims, with each year seeing a higher number of victims than the previous year: in 1994 (when brothels were illegal) there were 168 recorded trafficking victims;<ref>http://www.catwinternational.org/factbook/Netherlands.php</ref> by 2004 there were

=== Sex work and HIV === . 

Despite the depth of knowledge of HIV/AIDS, rapid transmission has occurred globally in sex workers. <ref name="pmid11251723"/> The relationship between these two variables greatly increases the risk of transmission among these populations, and also to anyone associated with them, such as their sexual partners, their children, and eventually the population at large. <ref name="pmid11251723"/> . 

Many street-level harm-reduction strategies have succeeded in reducing HIV transmission in [[injecting drug user]]s and sex-workers. <ref name="pmid16360791">{{cite journal |author=Rekart ML |title=Sex-work harm reduction |journal=Lancet |volume=366 |issue=9503 |pages=2123–34 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16360791 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67732-X |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(05)67732-X}}</ref> HIV education, HIV testing, condom use, and safer-sex negotiation greatly decreases the risk to the disease. <ref name="pmid16360791"/> Peer education as a harm reduction strategy has especially reduced the risk of HIV infection, such as in Chad, where this method was the most cost-effective per infection prevented. <ref name="pmid16360791"/> . 

== Decriminalisation == . 

The threat of criminal repercussions drives sex-workers and injecting drug users to the margins of society, often resulting in high-risk behaviour, increasing the rate of overdose, infectious disease transmission, and violence. <ref name="pmid18164610">{{cite journal |title=Harm reduction headway and continuing resistance: insights from safe injection in the city of Vancouver |journal=Int. J. Drug Policy |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=11–6 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18164610 |doi=10.1016/j.drugpo.2007.11.006 |url= |author1=Hathaway AD |author2=Tousaw KI |author-separator=, |author-name-separator=}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=May 2010}} Decriminalisation as a harm-reduction strategy gives the ability to treat drug abuse solely as a public health issue rather than a criminal activity. This enables other harm-reduction strategies to be employed, which results in a lower incidence of HIV infection. <ref name="pmid16360791"/> . 

== Self harm ==. 
{{unreferenced|section|date=March 2012}}
Harm reduction programmes work with people who are at risk of [[self harm]] (e.g. cutting, burning, etc.) Such programmes aim at education and the provision of medical services for wounds and other negative consequences. The hope is that the harmful behaviour will be moderated and the people helped to keep safe as they learn new methods of coping.  . 

== Psychiatric medications == . 

With the growing concern about psychiatric medication adverse effects and long-term dependency, peer-run mental health groups [[Freedom Center (mental health organization)|Freedom Center]] and [[The Icarus Project]] published the Harm Reduction Guide to Coming Off Psychiatric Drugs. The self-help guide provides patients with information to help assess risks and benefits, and to prepare to come off, reduce, or continue medications when their physicians are unfamiliar with or unable to provide this guidance. The guide is in circulation among mental health consumer groups and has been translated into Spanish and German. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://theicarusproject.net/HarmReductionGuideComingOffPsychDrugs|title=Harm Reduction Guide to Coming Off Psychiatric Drugs |first=Will |last=Hall |month=September |year=2007}}</ref>
<!-- To-do list that someone dropped in here:
== Other programmes ==. 
Other harm reduction programmes to be expanded on:
* Encouragement of the use of safer cannabis smoking devices/cannabinoid delivery systems such as [[vaporiser]]s, as opposed to water pipes, cigarettes and straight pipes
* Encouragement of the use of smokeless systems of nicotine delivery, known as [[Tobacco harm reduction]], as opposed to the much riskier method of burning and inhaling tobacco. 
* Promote the use of safer modes of use such as safer crack pipes (as opposed to use of a pipe which may burn or cut the users mouth, increasing risk of transmittable diseases) Use of screens which are safer than the use of a brillo pad which may embed metal particles into the lungs. 
* Promote various safer use strategies such as having a chronic alcoholic have a chaser of water between drinks. 
* Advocate the use of a Substitute Decision Maker or Power of Attorney so a person's rent is paid before the drug of choice, ensuring the person always has housing. 
* Provide vitamins to ensure a person's physical needs are somewhat met
* Lessen the use of mouthwash, Gravol, isopropanol etc. in poverty-stricken chronic alcoholics as a source of an alcohol, and replace with something less destructive, such as ethanol without toxic additives, and eliminate the use of isopropanol. 
* Allowing young people decision making power and access to [[birth control|contraceptives]]
* Allowing young people decision making power to terminate a pregnancy. 
* State regulated production and distribution of formerly illegal drugs (legalization)
* History of Harm Reduction

== Criticism ==. 
Critics, such as [[Drug Free America Foundation]] and other members of network ''International Task Force on Strategic Drug Policy'', state that a risk posed by harm reduction is by creating the perception that certain behaviours can be partaken of safely, such as illicit drug use, that it may lead to an increase in that behaviour by people who would otherwise be deterred. There is no empirical evidence or peer-reviewed literature to support these arguments, and much to refute them.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Little anecdotal evidence supports them beyond the arguments and claims put forth by anti-harm reduction groups themselves.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} . 

{{quote|We oppose so-called 'harm reduction' strategies as endpoints that promote the false notion that there are safe or responsible ways to use drugs. That is, strategies in which the primary goal is to enable drug users to maintain addictive, destructive, and compulsive behavior by misleading users about some drug risks while ignoring others.|"Statement on so-called 'Harm Reduction' polices" made at a conference in Brussels, Belgium by signatories of the drug prohibitionist network International Task Force on Strategic Drug Policy<ref>[http://www.itfsdp.org/pdfs/hrstatementbrussels.pdf]</ref>}} . 

However, in Switzerland the incidence of heroin abuse has declined sharply since the introduction of heroin assisted treatment. As a study published in [[The Lancet]] concluded: . 

{{quote|The harm reduction policy of Switzerland and its emphasis on the medicalisation of the heroin problem seems to have contributed to the image of heroin as unattractive for young people."| Nordt, Carlos, and Rudolf Stohler, "Incidence of Heroin Use in Zurich, Switzerland: A Treatment Case Register Analysis,"<ref name=Nordt06>{{cite journal |author=Nordt C, Stohler R |title=Incidence of heroin use in Zurich, Switzerland: a treatment case register analysis |journal=Lancet |volume=367 |issue=9525 |pages=1830–4 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16753485 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68804-1 }}</ref>}} . 

Critics furthermore reject harm reduction measures for allegedly trying to establish certain forms of drug use as acceptable in society: . 

{{quote|Harm reduction has come to represent a philosophy in which illicit substance use is seen as largely unpreventable, and increasingly, as a feasible and acceptable lifestyle as long as use is not 'problematic'. At its root of this philosophy lay an acceptance of drug use into the mainstream of society. We reject this philosophy as fatalistic and faulty at its core. The idea that we can safely use drugs is a dangerous one. ... It is in fact an unsafe choice that brings great harm to individuals, families, and communities across. And it sends the wrong message to the most valuable yet vulnerable group of Canadians – our children and youth.|Drug Prevention Network of Canada<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20100424034742/http://www.dpnoc.ca/harm_reduction.htm]</ref>}} . 

{{quote|Even though the world is against drug abuse, some organizations and local governments actively advocate the legalization of drugs and promote policies such as 'harm reduction' that accept drug use and do not help drug users to become free from drug abuse. This undermines the international efforts to limit the supply of and demand for drugs. 'Harm reduction' is too often another word for drug legalization or other inappropriate relaxation efforts, a policy approach that violates the UN Conventions. 
There can be no other goal than a drug-free world. [...]
