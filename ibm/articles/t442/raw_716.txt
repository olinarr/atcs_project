'''Family planning''' is the [[planning]] of when to have [[child]]ren,<ref name=OPAMission>{{cite web |url=http://www.hhs.gov/opa/about/mission/index.html |title=Mission Statement |publisher=US Dept. of Health and Human Services, Office of Population Affairs}}</ref>    and the use of [[birth control]]<ref name="WHOFP" /><ref name="UKNHS" />    and other techniques to implement such plans. Other techniques commonly used include [[sex education|sexuality education]],<ref name="UKNHS" /><ref name="USDOH-FPSvcs" />    prevention and management of [[sexually transmitted infection]]s,<ref name="UKNHS">[http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=839 What services do family planning clinics provide? - Health Questions - NHS Direct]</ref>    [[pre-conception counseling]]<ref name="UKNHS" />    and [[pregnancy#Management|management]], and [[infertility| infertility management]]. <ref name="WHOFP">[http://www.who.int/topics/family_planning/en/ Family planning] - WHO</ref> . 

Family planning is sometimes used as a synonym for the use of [[birth control]], however, it often includes a wide variety of methods, and practices that are not birth control.  It is most usually applied to a [[female]]-[[male]] couple who wish to limit the number of children they have and/or to control the timing of [[pregnancy]] (also known as ''spacing children'').  Family planning may encompass [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]], as well as [[abortion]]. <ref>See, e.g., Mischell DR. "Family planning: contraception, sterilization, and pregnancy termination." In: Katz VL, Lentz GM, Lobo RA, Gershenson DM, eds. ''Comprehensive Gynecology''. 5th ed. Philadelphia, Pa: Mosby Elsevier; 2007:chap 14. </ref> . 

Family planning services are defined as "educational, comprehensive medical or social activities which enable individuals, including minors, to determine freely the number and spacing of their children and to select the means by which this may be achieved."<ref name="USDOH-FPSvcs">[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/systems/ncands/ncands98/glossary/glossary.htm US Dept. of Health, Administration for children and families]</ref> . 

==Purposes== . 

Raising a child requires significant amounts of resources: time,<ref name=USDAChildExpense /> social, financial,<ref>[http://www.msmoney.com/mm/planning/marriage/family_planning.htm MsMoney.com - Marriage, Kids & College - Family Planning<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and environmental. 
Planning can help assure that resources are available. The purpose of family planning is to make sure that any couple, man or woman who has the desire to have a child has the resources that are needed in order to complete this goal. <ref>{{cite web| title=Office of Family Planning| url=http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/OFP/Pages/default.aspx| publisher=California Department of Public Health}}</ref>{{dubious|date=March 2012}}  With these resources a couple, man or women can explore the options of natural birth, surrogacy, artificial insemination or adoption. In the other case, if the person does not wish to have a child at the specific time, they can investigate the resources that are needed to prevent pregnancy, such as birth control, contraceptives, or physical protection and prevention.  . 

===Health===. 
{{See also| Maternal health|teenage pregnancy}} . 

Waiting until the mother is at least 18 years old before trying to have children improves maternal and child health. <ref name=USAIDHTSP>{{cite web |url=http://www.esdproj.org/site/PageServer?pagename=Themes_Spacing_KeyMessages |
title = Healthy Timing and Spacing of Pregnancy: HTSP Messages |
publisher = USAID |accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref>
Also, if additional children are desired after a child is born, it is healthier for the mother and the child to wait at least 2 years after the previous birth before attempting to conceive (but not more than 5 years). <ref name=USAIDHTSP/>     After a [[miscarriage]] or [[abortion]], it is healthier to wait at least 6 months. <ref name=USAIDHTSP/> . 

"Family planning benefits the health and well-being of women and families throughout the world. Using contraception can help to avoid unwanted pregnancies and space births; protect against STDs, including HIV/AIDS; and provide other health benefits."<ref>[http://www.reproline.jhu.edu/english/1fp/1fp.htm Reproline Family Planning]</ref> . 

==Modern methods==. 
{{main|Fertility tourism}}
Some families use modern medical advances in family planning. For example in [[surrogacy]] treatments a woman agrees to become pregnant and deliver a child for another couple or person.  . 

In [[sperm donation]]s, pregnancies are usually achieved using donated sperm by [[artificial insemination]] (either by [[intracervical insemination]] or [[intrauterine insemination]]) and less commonly by in vitro fertilization ([[IVF]]), usually known in this context as [[Assisted reproductive technology]] (ART), but insemination may also be achieved by a donor having [[sexual intercourse]] with a woman for the sole purpose of initiating conception. This method is known as natural [[insemination]] (NI).  . 

There is generally a demand for sperm donors who have no genetic problems in their family, 20/20 eyesight, with excellent [[visual acuity]], a college degree, and sometimes a value on a certain height and age. <ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/sperm.shtml The Genius Sperm Bank] June 2006</ref><ref>Baby steps; how lesbian alternative insemination is changing the world. By Amy Agigian</ref> . 

In cases were couples may not want to have children just yet and plan with time family planning programs help alot. Federal family planning programs reduced childbearing among poor women by as much as 29 percent, according to a University of Michigan study. <ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.sampler.isr.umich.edu/2011/research/family-planning-federal-program-reduced-births-to-poor-women-by-nearly-30-percent/  | title = Family planning: Federal program reduced births to poor women by nearly 30 percent | accessdate = 2012-03-19}}</ref> . 

===Finances===. 
{{See also|Family economics|Cost of raising a child}} . 

Family planning is among the most cost-effective of all health interventions. <ref name=Tsui/>  "The cost savings stem from a reduction in unintended pregnancy, as well as a reduction in transmission of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV."<ref name=Tsui>{{cite journal |author=Tsui AO, McDonald-Mosley R, Burke AE |title=Family planning and the burden of unintended pregnancies |journal=Epidemiol Rev |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=152–74 |year=2010 |month=April |pmid=20570955 |pmc=3115338 |doi=10.1093/epirev/mxq012 |url=}}</ref> .

==Birth control== . 

{{main|Birth control}} . 

Birth control is techniques used to prevent [[unwanted pregnancy]].  . 

There are a [[comparison of contraceptive methods|range of contraceptive methods]], each with unique advantages and disadvantages. Any of the widely recognized methods of birth control is much more effective than no method. Behavioral methods that include intercourse, such as [[withdrawal]] and [[calendar based methods]] have little up front cost and are readily available, but are much less effective in typical use than most other methods. [[Long-acting reversible contraceptive]] methods, such as IUD and implant are highly effective and convenient, requiring little user action. When cost of failure is included, IUDs and [[vasectomy]] are much less costly than other methods. 
In addition to providing birth control, [[condom|male]] or [[female condom]]s protect against [[sexually transmitted diseases]] (STD).  Condoms may be used alone, or in addition to other methods, as backup or to prevent STD. Surgical methods ([[tubal ligation]], [[vasectomy]]) provide long term contraception for those who have completed their families.  .

{{See also|International Planned Parenthood Federation|Marie Stopes International|United States Agency for International Development}}
The world's largest international source of funding for population and reproductive health programs is the [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA). The main goals of the [[International Conference on Population and Development]] Program of Action are: . 

* Universal access to [[reproductive health]] services by 2015
* Universal primary education and closing the gender gap in education by 2015
* Reducing maternal mortality by 75% by 2015
* Reducing [[infant mortality]]
* Increasing life expectancy
* Reducing [[HIV]] infection rates in persons aged 15–24 years by 25% in the most-affected countries by 2005, and by 25% globally by 2010 . 

The [[World health organization]] (WHO) and [[World Bank]] estimate that $3.00 per person per year would provide basic family planning, maternal and neonatal health care to women in developing countries.  This would include [[contraception]], prenatal, delivery and post-natal care in addition to postpartum family planning and the promotion of [[condoms]] to prevent [[sexually transmitted infections]]. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.globalhealth.org/news/article/2319 | title = Promises to Keep: The Toll of Unintended Pregnancies on Women's Lives in the Developing World | accessdate = 2009-02-03}}</ref> . 

===China===. 
{{Main|One-child policy}}
[[People's Republic of China|China]]'s ''[[one-child policy]]'' forces couples to have no more than one child. Beginning in 1979, <ref>{{cite web|last=Kane|first=Penny|title=China's one child family policy|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1116810/}}</ref> the policy was instated to control the rapid population growth that was occurring in the nation at this time. WIth the rapid change in population, China was facing many impacts of the rapid population growth including poverty and homelessness. As a developing nation, the Chinese government was concerned that a continuation of the rapid population growth that had been occurring would hinder their development as a nation. The process of family planning varied throughout China, as many different people differed in their responsiveness to the one child policy, based on location and socioeconomic status. For example, many families in the cities accepted this policy more readily based on the lack of space, money, and resources that are often offered in the cities. However, the people in rural areas of China were more hesitant in accepting this policy.   Since the policy was put into place in 1979, over 400 million births have been prevented in China. <ref>{{cite web|last=FlorCruz|first=Jaime|title=China copes with promise and perils of one child policy|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-10-28/asia/world_asia_china-one-child_1_family-planning-policy-population-policy-china/2?_s=PM:ASIA|publisher=CNN|accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref>  China's population policy has been credited with a very significant slowing of China's population growth which had been higher before the policy was implemented. However,  it has come under criticism that the policy has created abuse for women in China. Often times implementation of the policy has involved forced [[abortion]]s and [[forced sterilization]]. However, while the punishment of "unplanned" pregnancy is a large fine, both forced abortion and forced sterilization can be charged with intentional assault, which is punished with up to 10 years' imprisonment.  . 

Another aspect of family planning in China due to the one-child policy is the differentiation between the desire for male and female children in both urban and rural locations. In the Chinese culture, the desire for a male child is much harder, making the abandonment or abortion of female infants or fetuses common in the rural areas of the nation. <ref>{{cite web|last=FlorCruz|first=Jaime|title=China copes with promise and perils of one child policy|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-10-28/asia/world_asia_china-one-child_1_family-planning-policy-population-policy-china/2?_s=PM:ASIA|publisher=CNN|accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref> . Another issue that is raised in the one-child policy in China is the information in regards to naturally giving birth to twins or triplets. If this situation arises, the family is allowed to keep the children because of the natural causes of this impregnation.  .

In Hong Kong, the Eugenics League was found in 1936, which became [[The Family Planning Association of Hong Kong]] in 1950. <ref name="famplan.org.hk">[http://www.famplan.org.hk/fpahk/en/template1.asp?style=template1.asp&content=about/history.asp History of the Family Planning Association of Hong Kong]</ref> The organisation provides family planning advice, [[sex education]], [[birth control]] services to the general public of [[Hong Kong]].

The sale of contraceptives was illegal in Ireland from 1935 until 1980, when it was legalized with strong restrictions, later loosened. It has been argued that the resulting [[demographic dividend]] played a role in the economic boom in Ireland in the 1990s (the [[Celtic tiger]]) was in part due to the [[An Irish solution to an Irish problem|legalization of contraception in 1979]] and subsequent decline in the fertility rate. <ref>[[David E. Bloom|Bloom, David E.]] and [[David Canning]], 2003, Contraception and the Celtic Tiger, ''Economic and Social Review'', 34, pp 229-247. </ref> In Ireland the ratio of workers to dependents improved due to lower fertility but was raised further by increased female labor market participation.  . 

===Pakistan===. 
{{Main|Family planning in Pakistan}} . 

In agreement with the 1994 [[International Conference on Population and Development]] in Cairo, [[Pakistan]] pledged that by 2010 it would provide universal access to family planning. Additionally, Pakistan’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper has set specific national goals for increases in family planning and [[contraceptive]] use. <ref>Hardee, Karen and Leahy, Elizabeth. “Population, Fertility and Family Planning in Pakistan: A Program in Stagnation.” Population Action International. Volume 4, Number 1, 1-12. 2007. </ref> . 

===Russia===. 
{{See also|Demographics of Russia}} . 

According to a 2004 study, current pregnancies were termed "desired and timely" by 58% of respondents, while 23% described them as "desired, but untimely", and 19% said they were "undesired".  As of 2004, the share of women of reproductive age using hormonal or intrauterine birth control methods was about 46% (29% intrauterine, 17% hormonal). <ref name="und">[http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/nationalreports/europethecis/russia/NHDR_Russia_2008_Eng.pdf National Human Development Report Russian Federation 2008], [[UNDP]],''pages 47–49'', Retrieved on 10 October 2009</ref>  During the soviet era high quality contraceptives were difficult to obtain, and abortion became the most common way of preventing unwanted births.  Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union abortion rates have fallen considerably, but they are still higher than rates in many developed countries.  .

===United States=== . 

Despite the availability of highly effective contraceptives, about half of US [[Unintended pregnancy|pregnancies are unintended]]. <ref name=Trussell2009/> Highly effective contraceptives, such as [[IUD]] are underused in the United States. <ref name=Cleland /> Increasing use of highly effective contraceptives could help meet the goal set forward in [[Healthy people|Healthy People 2020]] to decrease unintended pregnancy by 10%. <ref name=Cleland />  Cost to the user is one factor preventing many US women from using more effective contraceptives. <ref name=Cleland />  Making contraceptives available without a copay increases use of highly effective methods, reduces unintended pregnancies, and may be instrumental in achieving the Healthy People 2020 goal. <ref name=Cleland /> . 

Teenage pregnancies are very involved in today's society and because of this the resources that are around for family planning is vital to the survival of these infants.  Federally funded programs such as Planned Parenthood are very important in the family planning process of adolescents because of the involvement of doctors, gynecologists, or medicine. These family planning practices also help impact the teenager and the infant because of the availability of healthcare and other resources that may otherwise not be offered. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Cromer|first=B|coauthors=McCarthy, Maureen|title=Family Planning Services in Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention: The Views of Key Informants In Four Countries| journal=Family Planning Perspectives| year=1999| volume=31| issue=6|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3128799.html}}</ref> .
