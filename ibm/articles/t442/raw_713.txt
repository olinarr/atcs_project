'''Sexual health clinics''' specialize in the prevention and treatment of [[sexually transmitted infections]].  . 

Sexual health clinics provide only some [[reproductive health]] services. Few clinics perform [[abortion]]s or offer [[birth control]] other than [[condom]]s.  . 

==Terminology== . 

Sexual health clinics are also called ''[[Sexually transmitted disease]] (STD) clinics'', ''Sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics'', ''Venereal disease (VD) clinics'', or ''[[Genitourinary medicine]] (GUM) clinics''.  . 

Sexual health clinics differ from [[reproductive health]] and [[family planning]] clinics. Sexual health clinics offer only some reproductive health services. [[Reproductive health]] clinics, such as [[Planned Parenthood]], offer most of the services of sexual health clinics.  . 

==Services== . 

Sexual health clinics provide some or all of the following: . 

*Information about [[safer sex]], [[birth control]], [[reproductive health]] and general [[sex education]]
*[[Condom]]s
*Sexual health [[#Examinations|examinations]]
*[[STD testing|Tests]] to detect some [[sexually transmitted infection]]s
*[[Antibiotic]]s to [[cure]] [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[gonorrhea]], and [[syphilis]]
*[[Medication]]s and other [[Therapy|treatments]]
*[[Vaccination]]s
*Counseling and education
*[[Emergency contraception]]
*Referrals for additional information or services . 

Many clinics provide vaccinations to prevent [[infection]]s from the [[hepatitis A]] and [[Hepatitis B virus|B]] [[Introduction to viruses|viruses]]. <ref>

Young women may receive vaccinations to prevent infection from some strains of the [[HPV vaccine|human papillomavirus]] (HPV).  . 

Many clinics provide [[interpreting]] for the hearing impaired or speakers of other languages.  . 

Many clinics will help patients tell their sexual contacts if they have a sexually transmitted infection, anonymously if needed. <ref>

Public governmental and [[non-profit]] clinics often provide services for free or adjust the fee based on a patient's ability to pay.  . 

Sexual health clinics often offer services without appointments. Some clinics open evenings or weekends.  . 

Some clinics have separate hours or facilities for men and women. Some clinics serve only specific populations such as women, men, [[Men who have sex with men|MSM]], [[youths]], [[LGBT]], ethnic groups, the poor, or students.  . 

==Examinations==. 
<!-- {{ main|Sexual health examination}} -->
{{See also|intimate examination}} . 

With the patient's [[informed consent|consent]], a [[wiktionary:clinician|clinician]] will inspect the patient visually and by touch. If needed, the clinician will take samples to [[STD test|test]] for [[sexually transmitted infection]]s.  . 

In a private room or space, the patient will partially undress.  . 

The clinician may inspect the patient's:
*Throat and [[lymph node]]s of the neck for inflammation
*[[Pubic hair]] for [[pubic lice|lice]]
*[[Superficial inguinal lymph nodes|Lymph node]]s of the groin for swelling
*Genitals, [[Human anus|anus]], and surrounding areas for sores and [[wart]]s . 

The clinician may swab the patient's:
*Throat to test for [[gonorrhea]] and possibly [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]]
*Cheek, inside, to test for [[HIV]]
*Sores of the genitals, [[Human anus|anus]], and surrounding areas to test for [[herpes]]<ref>

The clinician may ask for a small [[urine]] sample, given in private, to test for [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] and possibly [[gonorrhea]].  . 

The inspections and taking samples don't hurt, but swabbing the urethra and cervix, and a finger prick blood sample feel uncomfortable.  . 

Women will often receive a [[pelvic exam]], both external and internal, but usually less thorough than a reproductive health exam.  . 

A patient can choose a female or male clinician if available. 
A patient can have a [[chaperone (clinical)|chaperone]]. 
Some clinics have separate hours or facilities for men and women.  . 

==Privacy==. 
Sexual health clinics follow local standards of medical confidentiality to protect the privacy of patients. 
Some clinics provide anonymous services or protect [[Wiktionary: confidential|confidentially]] by having a patient use a code name, a number, or a false name. <ref>

</ref> . 

Additional privacy protections sometimes apply to matters of sexuality and reproduction, since these areas are sensitive in many cultures.  . 

In the United States, clinics receiving federal funding from [[Medicaid]] or [[Title X]] of the [[Public Health Service Act]] must treat all patients confidentially. Thus minors can receive services without parental notification or consent. <ref>

==Consent== . 

Medical standards of [[informed consent]] apply to sexual health clinics. A patient needs information about the purposes and consequences of examinations, tests, treatments, and other procedures. A patient may then choose whether to consent to these procedures.  . 

A [[Minor (law)|minor]] may consent to receive some or all of the procedures at many sexual health clinics.  .
