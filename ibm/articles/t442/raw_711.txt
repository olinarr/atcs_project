'''Public health''' is "the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting [[health]] through the organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities and individuals" (1920, [[Charles-Edward Amory Winslow|C.E.A. Winslow]]). <ref>{{cite journal |author=Winslow, Charles-Edward Amory |title=The Untilled Fields of Public Health |journal=Science |date=1920 Jan 9 |volume=51 |issue=1306 |pages=23–33 |pmid=17838891 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17838891 |doi=10.1126/science.51.1306.23 }}</ref>  It is concerned with threats to health based on [[population health]] analysis. The population in question can be as small as a handful of people or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents (for instance, in the case of a [[pandemic]]). The dimensions of health can encompass "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity", as defined by the United Nations' [[World Health Organization]]. <ref>[http://www.who.int/suggestions/faq/en/ Frequently asked questions]
from the "Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization" as adopted by the [[International Health Conference, 1946]]</ref> Public health incorporates the [[interdisciplinary]] approaches of [[epidemiology]], [[biostatistics]] and [[health services]]. [[Environmental Health|Environmental health]], [[community health]], [[behavioral health]], [[health economics]], [[public policy]] and [[occupational health]] are other important subfields.  . 

The focus of public health intervention is to improve health and quality of life through the prevention and treatment of [[disease]] and other physical and mental health conditions, through [[Disease surveillance|surveillance]] of cases and the promotion of healthy behaviors. Promotion of [[hand washing]] and [[breastfeeding]], delivery of [[vaccination]]s, and distribution of [[condom]]s to control the spread of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s are examples of common public health measures.  . 

Modern public health practice requires [[multidisciplinarity|multidisciplinary teams]] of professionals including [[physician]]s specialising in public health/community medicine/infectious disease, [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]], [[biostatistics|biostatisticians]], [[nursing#Public Health Nursing|public health nurses]], [[microbiologist|medical microbiologists]], [[environmental health officer]]s, [[dental hygienist]]s, [[dietitian]]s and [[nutritionist]]s, [[health inspector]]s, [[veterinarian]]s, public health engineers, public health lawyers, [[sociologist]]s, community development workers, communications officers, and others. <ref>{{cite book |author1=Joint Task Group on Public Health Human Resources |author2=Advisory Committee on Health Delivery & Human Resources |author3=Advisory Committee on Population Health & Health Security |publisher=Public Health Agency of Canada |title=Building the public health workforce for the 21st century |location=Ottawa |year=2005 |oclc=144167975}}</ref> . 

==Objectives==. 
The focus of a public health intervention is to prevent and manage diseases, injuries and other health conditions through surveillance of cases and the [[health promotion|promotion of healthy behaviors]], [[healthy community design|communities]] and [[environmental protection|environments]]. Many diseases are preventable through simple, non-medical methods. For example, research has shown that the simple act of [[hand washing]] with soap can prevent many contagious diseases. <ref>Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap. [http://www.globalhandwashing.org/handwashing-resources ''Handwashing research''], accessed 19 April 2011. </ref> In other cases, treating a disease or controlling a [[pathogen]] can be vital to preventing its spread to others, such as during an outbreak of [[infectious disease]], or contamination of food or water supplies. [[Behavior change (public health)|Public health communications programs]], [[vaccination]] programs, and distribution of [[condom]]s are examples of common public health measures.  . 

Public health plays an important role in disease prevention efforts in both the developing world and in developed countries, through local health systems and [[non-governmental organization]]s. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) is the international agency that coordinates and acts on [[global health|global public health]] issues. Most countries have their own government public health agencies, sometimes known as ministries of health, to respond to domestic health issues. For example in the [[United States]], the front line of public health initiatives are state and local [[health department]]s. The [[United States Public Health Service]] (PHS), led by the [[Surgeon General of the United States]], and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], headquartered in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], are involved with several international health activities, in addition to their national duties. In Canada, the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]] is the national agency responsible for public health, emergency preparedness and response, and infectious and [[chronic disease]] control and prevention. The [[Public health system in India]] is managed by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare of the government of India with state owned health care facilities.  . 

There is a vast discrepancy in access to [[health care]] and public health initiatives between [[developed nations]] and [[developing nations]]. In the developing world, public health infrastructures are still forming. There may not be enough trained [[health workforce|health workers]] or monetary resources to provide even a basic level of medical care and disease prevention. <ref>{{cite book |author1=Lincoln C Chen |author2=David Evans |author3=Tim Evans |author4=Ritu Sadana |author5=Barbara Stilwell |author6=Phylida Travis |author7=Wim Van Lerberghe |author8=Pascal Zurn |title=World Health Report 2006: working together for health |location=Geneva |publisher=WHO |year=2006 |oclc=71199185 }}</ref> As a result, a large majority of disease and mortality in the developing world results from and contributes to extreme poverty. For example, many African governments spend less than [[United States dollar|US$]]10 per person per year on health care, while, in the United States, the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]] spent approximately US$4,500 per capita in 2000.  . 

==History==. 
In some ways, public health is a modern concept of human development in science, although it has roots in antiquity. From the beginnings of [[human civilization]], it was recognized that polluted [[water]] and lack of proper [[waste disposal]] spread communicable diseases (theory of [[miasma theory of disease|miasma]]). Early [[religion]]s attempted to regulate behavior that specifically related to health, from types of [[food]] eaten, to regulating certain indulgent behaviors, such as drinking [[alcohol]] or [[human sexual behaviour|sexual relations]]. The establishment of [[government]]s placed responsibility on [[leadership|leader]]s to develop public health policies and programs in order to gain some understanding of the causes of [[disease]] and thus ensure social stability [[wealth|prosperity]], and maintain order.  . 

The term "[[healthy city]]" used by today's public health advocates reflects this ongoing challenge to collective physical well-being that results from crowded conditions and urbanization.  . 

===Early public health interventions===. 
[[Image:Public Health nursing.gif|thumb|200px|Public health nursing made available through child welfare services in U.S. (c. 1930s)]] . 

By [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, it was well understood that proper [[waste management|diversion of human waste]] was a necessary tenet of public health in urban areas. The [[history of China|Chinese]] developed the practice of [[variolation]] following a [[smallpox]] epidemic around 1000 BC. An individual without the disease could gain some measure of immunity against it by inhaling the dried crusts that formed around lesions of infected individuals. Also, children were protected by [[inoculation|inoculating]] a scratch on their forearms with the pus from a lesion. This practice was not documented in the West until the early-18th century, and was used on a very limited basis. The practice of [[vaccination]] did not become prevalent until the 1820s, following the work of [[Edward Jenner]] to treat [[smallpox]].  . 

During the 14th century [[Black Death]] in [[Europe]], it was believed that removing bodies of the dead would further prevent the spread of the bacterial infection. This did little to stem the plague, however, which was most likely spread by [[rodent]]-borne [[flea]]s. Burning parts of cities resulted in much greater benefit, since it destroyed the rodent infestations {{citation needed|date=December 2011}}. The development of [[quarantine]] in the medieval period helped mitigate the effects of other infectious diseases. However, according to [[Michel Foucault]], the plague model of [[governmentality]] was later controverted by the [[cholera]] model. A Cholera pandemic devastated Europe between 1829 and 1851, and was first fought by the use of what Foucault called "social medicine", which focused on flux, circulation of air, location of [[cemeteries]], etc. All those concerns, born of the [[miasma theory of disease]], were mixed with [[urbanism|urbanistic]] concerns for the management of populations, which Foucault designated as the concept of "[[biopower]]". The German conceptualized this in the ''[[Polizeiwissenschaft]]'' ("[[Police science]]").  . 

The science of [[epidemiology]] was founded by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s identification of a polluted public water well as the source of an 1854 [[cholera]] outbreak in London. Dr. Snow believed in the [[germ theory]] of disease as opposed to the prevailing [[Miasma theory of disease|miasma theory]]. Although miasma theory correctly teaches that disease is a result of poor sanitation, it was based upon the prevailing theory of [[spontaneous generation]]. Germ theory developed slowly: despite [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]]'s observations of [[Microorganisms]], (which are now known to cause many of the most common infectious diseases) in the year 1680, the modern era of public health did not begin until the 1880s, with [[Louis Pasteur]]'s germ theory and production of artificial [[vaccine]]s.  . 

Other public health interventions include latrinization, the building of [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s, the regular collection of garbage followed by incineration or disposal in a [[landfill]], providing clean water and draining standing water to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes. This contribution was made by Edwin Chadwick in 1843 who published a report on the sanitation of the working class population in Great Britain at the time. So began the inception of the modern public health. The industrial revolution had initially caused the spread of disease through large conurbations around workhouses and factories. These settlements were cramped and primitive and there was no organised sanitation. Disease was inevitable and its incubation in these areas was encouraged by the poor lifestyle of the inhabitants.  . 

===Modern public health===. 
With the onset of the [[epidemiological transition]] and as the prevalence of [[Infectious disease in the 20th century|infectious diseases decreased through the 20th century]], public health began to put more focus on [[chronic diseases]] such as [[cancer]] and [[heart disease]]. Previous efforts in many developed countries had already led to dramatic reductions in the [[infant mortality rate]] using preventative methods. For instance in the United States, public health worker Dr. [[Sara Josephine Baker]] established many programs to help the poor in New York City keep their infants healthy, leading teams of nurses into the crowded neighborhoods of [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] and teaching  mothers how to dress, feed, and bathe their babies.  . 

During the 20th century and early in the next, the dramatic increase in average life span is widely credited to public health achievements, such as vaccination programs and control of many infectious diseases including [[Poliomyelitis|polio]], [[diphtheria]], [[yellow fever]] and [[smallpox]]; effective health and safety policies such as [[road traffic safety]] and [[Occupational safety and health|occupational safety]]; improved [[family planning]]; [[tobacco control]] measures; and programs designed to decrease [[non-communicable disease]]s by acting on known risk factors such as a person's background, lifestyle and environment. One of the major sources of the increase in average life span in the early 20th century was the decline in the "urban penalty" brought on by improvements in [[sanitation]].  These improvements included [[chlorination]] of drinking water, filtration and [[sewage treatment]] which led to the decline in deaths caused by infectious [[waterborne diseases]] such as [[cholera]] and intestinal diseases.  In Cutler and Miller's, "The Role of Public Health Improvements in Health Advances", they display evidence of the decline in [[typhoid fever]] deaths in Chicago, Baltimore, Cincinnati, and Cleveland after these American cities adopted chlorination, filtration, or a sewage improvement. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Cuter|first=David|coauthors=Grant Miller|title=The Role of Public Health Improvements in Health Advances: The Twentieth Century United States |journal=Demography |year=2005 |month=February |volume=42 |issue=1 |oclc=703811616 |doi=10.1353/dem.2005.0002|pages=1–22|pmid=15782893 }}</ref>
[[Image:MRT Myanmar.jpg|thumb|Emergency Response Team in [[Burma]] in the aftermath of [[Cyclone Nargis]]]]
Meanwhile, large parts of the developing world remained plagued by largely preventable/treatable infectious diseases and poor [[maternal health|maternal]] and child health outcomes, exacerbated by [[malnutrition]] and poverty. The [[WHO]] reports that a lack of [[Breastfeeding#Exclusive breastfeeding|exclusive breastfeeding]] during the first six months of life contributes to over a million avoidable child deaths each year. <ref>{{cite web |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/breastfeeding/en/index.html |title=10 facts on breastfeeding |accessdate=20 April 2011}}</ref> [[Intermittent preventive therapy]] aimed at treating and preventing [[malaria]] episodes among  pregnant women and young children is one public health measure in [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] countries.  . 

Front-page headlines continue to present society with public health issues on a daily basis: emerging infectious diseases such as [[SARS]], rapidly making its way from China (see [[Public health in China]]) to Canada, the United States and other geographically distant countries; reducing [[health equity|inequities in health care access]] through publicly funded health insurance programs; the [[HIV/AIDS pandemic]] and its spread from certain high-risk groups to the general population in many countries, such as in [[HIV/AIDS in South Africa|South Africa]]; the increase of [[childhood obesity]] and the concomitant increase in type II diabetes among children; the social, economic and health impacts of [[adolescent pregnancy]]; and the ongoing public health challenges related to [[natural disaster]]s such as the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]], [[Hurricane Katrina|2005's Hurricane Katrina]] in the United States and the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].  . 

Since the 1980s, the growing field of [[population health]] has broadened the focus of public health from individual behaviors and [[risk factor]]s to population-level issues such as [[health equity|inequality]], poverty, and education. Modern public health is often concerned with addressing determinants of health across a population. There is a recognition that our health is affected by many factors including where we live, genetics, our income, our educational status and our social relationships - these are known as "[[social determinants of health]]." A social gradient in health runs through society, with those that are poorest generally suffering the worst health. However even those in the ''middle classes'' will generally have worse health outcomes than those of a higher social stratum. <ref>{{cite book |title=The Solid Facts: Social Determinants of Health |editor1=Richard G. Wilkinson |editor2=Michael G. Marmot |publisher=WHO |year=2003 |oclc=54966941 }}</ref> The ''new'' public health seeks to address these health inequalities by advocating for population-based policies that improve health in an equitable manner.  . 

==== Public Health 2.0 ==== . 

''Public Health 2.0'' is the term given to a movement within public health that aims to make the field more accessible to the general public and more user-driven.  There are three senses in which the term "Public Health 2.0" is used.  In the first sense, "Public Health 2.0" is similar to the term "[[Health 2.0]]" and is used to describe the ways in which traditional public health practitioners and institutions are reaching out (or could reach out) to the public through social media. <ref>{{Cite journal | author = Wilson, Kumanan | coauthor = Keelan, Jennifer | year = 2009 | month = May | title = Coping with public health 2.0 | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 180 | issue = 10 | pages = 1080 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.090696 | pmid = 19433834 | pmc = 2679846}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | author = Vance, K. | coauthors = Howe, W.; Dellavalle, R.P. | year = 2009 | month = April | title = Social internet sites as a source of public health information | journal = Dermatologic Clinics | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–136 | doi = 10.1016/j.det.2008.11.010 | pmid = 19254656}}</ref> In the second sense, "Public Health 2.0" is used to describe public health research that uses data gathered from social networking sites, search engine queries, cell phones, or other technologies. <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://governmentfutures.com/images/stories/documents/PublicHealth2-0NotesPRINT.pdf |title=Public Health 2.0: Spreading like a virus |accessdate=2011-06-13 |date=24 |year=2007 |month=April}}</ref>  In the third sense, "Public Health 2.0" is used to describe public health activities that are completely user-driven. <ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.publichealth2point0.ca |title=Public Health 2.0 FAQs |accessdate=2011 June 13 |author=DLSPH Conference Planning Committee | publisher=Public Health 2.0 Conference}}</ref>  An example this type of Public Health 2.0 is the collection and sharing of information about environmental radiation levels following the March 2011 tsunami in Japan. <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2011/04/201142317359479927.html |title=Crowdsourcing Japan's radiation levels |accessdate= 2011-06-13 |author = D.

==Education and training==. 
Education and training of public health professionals is available throughout the world in Medical Schools, Veterinary Schools, Schools of Nursing, Schools of Public Health, and Schools of Public Affairs. The training typically requires a [[university degree]] with a focus on core disciplines of [[biostatistics]], [[epidemiology]], [[Health administration|health services administration]], [[health policy]], [[health education]], [[behavioral science]] and [[environmental health]]. <ref name=mmwr4850>U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.

===Schools of public health===. 
In the [[United States]], the Welch-Rose Report of 1915 has been viewed as the basis for the critical movement in the history of the institutional schism between public health and medicine because it led to the establishment of schools of public health supported by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. <ref name="PHP">{{cite book |author=Patel, Kant; Rushefsky, Mark E.; McFarlane, Deborah R. |title=The Politics of Public Health in the United States |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |year=2005 |pages=91 |isbn=076561135X}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Fee, Elizabeth; Acheson, Roy M. |title=A History of education in public health : health that mocks the doctors' rules |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1991 |isbn=0192617575 }}</ref> The report was authored by [[William Welch]], founding dean of the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]], and Wycliffe Rose of the Rockefeller Foundation. The report focused more on research than practical education. <ref name="PHP" /><ref>{{cite journal |author=Brandt AM, Gardner M |year=2000 |title=Antagonism and accommodation: interpreting the relationship between public health and medicine in the United States during the 20th century |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=90 |pages=707–15 |pmid=10800418 |pmc=1446218 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.90.5.707 |issue=5 }}</ref> Some have blamed the Rockefeller Foundation's 1916 decision to support the establishment of schools of public health for creating the schism between public health and medicine and legitimizing the rift between medicine's laboratory investigation of the mechanisms of disease and public health's nonclinical concern with environmental and social influences on health and wellness. <ref name="PHP" /><ref>{{cite book |author=White, Kerr L. |year=1991 |title=Healing the schism: Epidemiology, medicine, and the public's health |location=New York |publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=0-387-97574-8}}</ref> . 

Even though schools of public health had already been established in [[Canada]], [[Europe]] and [[North Africa]], the US had still maintained the traditional system of housing faculties of public health within their medical institutions.  A $25,000 donation from businessman [[Samuel Zemurray]], instituted the country's first School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 1912, laying the groundwork for today's [[Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine|School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at Tulane University]]. <ref>{{cite book|last=Darnell|first=Regna|title=Histories of anthropology annual|year=2008|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|pages=36|isbn=0803266642}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dyer|first=John Percy|title=Tulane: the biography of a university, 1834-1965|year=1966|publisher=Harper & Row|pages=136}}</ref>  A year following the Welch-Rose report, and four years following Samuel Zemurray's donation to [[Tulane School of Public Health|Tulane]], the [[Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health]] was founded in 1916. By 1922, schools of public health were established in [[Columbia university|Columbia]], [[Harvard]] and [[Yale]] universities. By 1999 there were twenty nine schools of public health in the US, enrolling around fifteen thousand students. <ref name=mmwr4850/><ref name="PHP"/> . 

Over the years, the types of students and training provided have also changed. In the beginning, students who enrolled in public health schools typically had already obtained a medical degree; public health school training was largely a second degree for [[physician|medical professionals]]. However, in 1978, 69% of American students enrolled in public health schools had only a [[bachelor's degree]]. <ref name=mmwr4850/> . 

===Degrees in public health===. 
{{Main|Professional degrees of public health}} . 

Schools of public health offer a variety of degrees which generally fall into two categories: professional or academic. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ceph.org/pdf/Master_List.pdf|title=Schools of Public Health and Public Health Programs|author= |date=11 March 2011|publisher=[[Council on Education for Public Health]]|accessdate=30 March 2011}}</ref> The two major postgraduate professional degrees are the [[Master of Public Health]] (MPH) or the [[Master of Science]] in Public Health (MSPH). Doctoral studies in this field include [[Professional degrees of public health|Doctor of Public Health]] (DrPH) and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) in a subspeciality of greater Public Health disciplines. DrPH is regarded as a professional leadership degree and PhD is more an academic degree.  . 

Professional degrees are oriented towards practice in public health settings. The [[Master of Public Health]], [[Doctor of Public Health]], [[Doctor of Health Science]] (DHSc) and the [[Master of Health Administration|Master of Health Care Administration]] are examples of degrees which are geared towards people who want careers as practitioners of public health in health departments, managed care and community-based organizations, hospitals and consulting firms among others. [[Master of Public Health]] degrees broadly fall into two categories, those that put more emphasis on an understanding of epidemiology and statistics as the scientific basis of public health practice and those that include a more eclectic range of methodologies.  A Master of Science of Public Health is similar to an MPH but is considered an academic degree (as opposed to a professional degree) and places more emphasis on quantitative methods and research.  The same distinction can be made between the DrPH and the DHSc. The DrPH is considered a professional degree and the DHSc is an academic degree.  . 

Academic degrees are more oriented towards those with interests in the scientific basis of public health and [[preventive medicine]] who wish to pursue careers in research, university teaching in graduate programs, policy analysis and development, and other high-level public health positions. Examples of academic degrees are the [[Master of Science]], [[Doctor of Philosophy]], [[Doctor of Science]] (ScD), and [[Doctor of Health Science]] (DHSc). The doctoral programs are distinct from the MPH and other professional programs by the addition of advanced coursework and the nature and scope of a [[dissertation]] research project.  . 

In the United States, the Association of Schools of Public Health<ref>[http://www.asph.org/ Association of Schools of Public Health]</ref> represents [[Council on Education for Public Health]] (CEPH) accredited schools of public health. <ref>[http://www.ceph.org Council on Education for Public Health]</ref> [[Delta Omega]] is the [[honor society|honorary society]] for graduate studies in public health. The society was founded in 1924 at the [[Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health]]. Currently, there are approximately 68 chapters throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. <ref>http://www.deltaomega.org/</ref> . 

==Public health programs==. 
Today, most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence disease, disability, and the effects of aging and other physical and mental health conditions, although public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine. <ref>World Health Organization. "Public health principles and neurological disorders. In: ''Neurological Disorders: Public Health Challenges.'' Geneva; 2006 - http://www.who.int/mental_health/neurology/neurodiso/en/index.html</ref> In recent years, public health programs providing [[vaccination]]s have made incredible strides in promoting health, including the eradication of [[smallpox]], a disease that plagued humanity for thousands of years.  . 

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) identifies core functions of public health programs including:<ref>World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/about/role/en/ ''The role of WHO in public health''], accessed 19 April 2011. </ref>   
* providing leadership on matters critical to [[health]] and engaging in partnerships where joint action is needed;
* shaping a [[research]] agenda and stimulating the generation, translation and dissemination of valuable knowledge;
* setting norms and standards and promoting and monitoring their implementation;
* articulating ethical and [[evidence-based policy]] options;
* monitoring the health situation and assessing health trends.  . 

In particular, public health surveillance programs can:<ref>World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/topics/public_health_surveillance/en/ ''Public health surveillance''], accessed 19 April 2011. </ref> 
* serve as an [[early warning system]] for impending public health emergencies;
* document the impact of an intervention, or track progress towards specified goals; and
* monitor and clarify the epidemiology of health problems, allow priorities to be set, and inform [[public health policy|health policy]] and strategies. 
* diagnose, investigate, and monitor health problems and health hazards of the community . 

Public health surveillance has led to the identification and prioritization of many public health issues facing the world today, including [[HIV/AIDS]], [[diabetes]], [[waterborne diseases]], [[zoonosis|zoonotic diseases]], and [[antibiotic resistance]] leading to the reemergence of infectious diseases such as [[tuberculosis]]. Antibiotic resistance, also known as drug resistance, was the theme of [[World Health Day|World Health Day 2011]].  . 

For example, the WHO reports that at least 220 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes. Its incidence is increasing rapidly, and it is projected that the number of diabetes deaths will double by the year 2030. <ref>World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs312/en/ ''Diabetes Fact Sheet N°312'', January 2011]. Accessed 19 April 2011. </ref> In a June 2010 editorial in the medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'', the authors opined that "The fact that type 2 diabetes, a largely preventable disorder, has reached epidemic proportion is a public health humiliation."<ref>The Lancet editorial board. "Type 2 diabetes—time to change our approach." ''The Lancet'', 375(9733): 2193 http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(10)61011-2/fulltext#</ref> The risk of type 2 diabetes is closely linked with the growing problem of [[obesity]]. The WHO’s latest estimates highlighted that globally approximately 1.5 billion adults were overweight in 2008, and nearly 43 million children under the age of five were overweight in 2010. <ref>World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/ ''Obesity and overweight Fact sheet N°311'', Updated March 2011.] Accessed 19 April 2011. </ref> The United States is the leading country with 30.6% of its population being obese. Mexico follows behind with 24.2% and the United Kingdom with 23%. Once considered a problem in high-income countries, it is now on the rise in low-income countries, especially in urban settings. Many public health programs are increasingly dedicating attention and resources to the issue of obesity, with objectives to address the underlying causes including [[healthy diet]] and [[physical exercise]].  . 

Some programs and policies associated with public health promotion and prevention can be controversial. One such example is programs focusing on the prevention of [[HIV]] transmission through [[safe sex]] campaigns and [[needle-exchange programme]]s. Another is the control of [[tobacco smoking]]. Changing smoking behavior requires long term strategies, unlike the fight against [[communicable diseases]] which usually takes a shorter period for effects to be observed. Many nations have implemented [[tobacco smoking#Public policy|major initiatives]] to cut smoking, such as increased taxation and bans on smoking in some or all public places. Proponents argue by presenting evidence that smoking is one of the major killers, and that therefore governments have a duty to reduce the death rate, both through limiting [[Passive smoking|passive (second-hand) smoking]] and by providing fewer opportunities for people to smoke. Opponents say that this undermines individual freedom and personal responsibility, and worry that the state may be emboldened to remove more and more choice in the name of better population health overall.  . 

Simultaneously, while communicable diseases have historically ranged uppermost as a [[global health]] priority, [[non-communicable disease]]s and the underlying behavior-related risk factors have been at the bottom. This is changing however, as illustrated by the [[United Nations]] hosting its first General Assembly Special Summit on the issue of non-communicable diseases in September 2011. <ref>United Nations.
