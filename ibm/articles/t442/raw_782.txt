}} . 

In the [[history of the Catholic Church]], [[laity|laywomen]] and women in [[nun|religious orders]] have played a variety of roles and the church has affected societal attitudes to women throughout the world in significant ways. While Catholic women cannot become priests, prominent women in the life of the church have included everything from the mythical and historical figures of the [[Old Testament]], to the [[Virgin Mary]] and female disciples of Jesus in the [[New Testament]], to theologians, abbesses, monarchs, missionaries, mystics, martyrs, nurses, teachers and religious sisters.  . 

A special role and devotion is accorded to Jesus' mother, [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Marian devotion]] has been a central theme of [[Art in Roman Catholicism|Catholic art]]. Motherhood and family are given a sacred status in church teachings. Conversely, the role of [[Eve]] in the [[Garden of Eden]] and other biblical stories affected the development of a Western notion of woman as "temptress".  . 

The Gospels suggest Jesus himself broke with convention to provide religious instruction to both men and women. While the [[Twelve Apostles]] were all male, and there is much debate about the beliefs of early church leaders like [[St Paul]], women were very active in the early spread of Christianity. Though only men can receive the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacrament]] of [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Holy Orders]], there have been many female Catholic saints and many devotions started by women. Women have played an important role in Catholicism through convents and abbeys, particularly in the establishment of schools, hospitals, nursing homes and monastic settlements, through [[religious order]]s of nuns or sisters like the [[Benedictine]]s, [[Dominican Sisters|Dominicans]], [[Loreto Sisters]], [[Sisters of Mercy]], [[Little Sisters of the Poor]], [[Sisters of St. Joseph of the Sacred Heart|Josephites]], and [[Missionaries of Charity]].  . 

There are three women commemorated as [[Doctors of the Church]]: Spanish mystic, [[St. Teresa of Ávila]]; Italian mystic [[St. Catherine of Siena]] and the French nun [[St. Thérèse de Lisieux]]. Other Catholic women have risen to international prominence through charitable mission works and social justice campaigns—as with Nobel Peace Prize winner [[Mother Teresa]], and anti-death penalty campaigner Sister [[Helen Prejean]].  . 

The Church has influenced the status of women in various ways: condemning [[infanticide]], [[divorce]], [[incest]], [[polygamy]] and counting the [[Extramarital sex|marital infidelity]] of men as equally sinful to that of women. <ref name="Bokenkotter56">{{cite book |last=Bokenkotter |first= Thomas |year=2004 |title=A Concise History of the Catholic Church |publisher=Doubleday |ISBN=0385505841 |page=56}}</ref><ref name="Noble230">Noble, p. 230. </ref><ref name="Stark104">Stark, p. 104. </ref> The Church holds abortion and contraception to be sinful, thus affecting the reproductive practices of women.

The institution of the convent offered a rare space for female self-government, power and influence in Western society through many centuries. Nevertheless, according to some modern critiques, the Church's largely male hierarchy and refusal to ordain women implies "inferiority" of women. [[New feminism]] and [[Feminist theology]] deal extensively with Catholic attitudes to women.  .

===Early Christianity===. 
[[File:Otto van Veen.jpg|thumb|left|''Christ in the House of Martha and Mary'' by [[Otto van Veen]]. Breaking with the conventions of his age, Jesus was happy to give religious instruction to women.]]
[[File:Wüger Kreuzigung.jpg|thumb|[[Mary Magdalene]] kneeling within a [[Stabat Mater (art)|Stabat Mater scene]] by [[Gabriel Wuger]], 1868.]]
[[File:Helena of Constantinople (Cima da Conegliano).jpg|thumb|[[Helena (Empress)|St. Helena]], mother of the [[Emperor Constantine]], whose conversion to Christianity changed the course of world history.]] . 

The Catholic Church holds that it was founded by Christ in the First Century AD. <ref>http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03744a.htm</ref> The [[New Testament]] of the Bible upon which the Church bases this claim refers to a number of women in Jesus' inner circle - notably his Mother [[Virgin Mary|Mary]] (for whom the Catholic Church holds a special place of adoration) and St. [[Mary Magdalene]] who discovered the empty tomb of Christ. But the Church says that Christ appointed only male [[Apostles]] (from the Greek apostello "to send forth"). <ref>http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm</ref>  . 

As the bedrock text of Catholicism, the New Testament is instructive in terms of the attitudes espoused by the church towards women. Among the most famous accounts of Jesus directly dealing with an issue of morality and women is provided by the story [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery]],  from [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|verses]] {{bibleverse-nb||John|7:53-8:11}} of the [[Gospel of John]]. The passage describes a confrontation between [[Jesus]] and the [[scribe]]s and [[Pharisees]] over whether a woman, caught in an act of [[adultery]], ought to be [[stoning|stoned]]. Jesus shames the crowd into dispersing, and averts the execution with the famous words: "He that is without sin among you, let him first [[cast the first stone|cast a stone at her]]". According to the passage, "they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last", leaving Jesus to turn to the woman and say "go, and sin no more". This passage has been immensely influential in Christian philosophy.  . 

A revealing story contained in the Gospels as to Jesus' own attitude to women is found in the story of Jesus at the house of [[Martha]] and Mary. In this story the woman Mary sits at Jesus' feet as he preaches, while her sister toils in the kitchen preparing a meal. When Martha complains to Mary that she should instead be helping in the kitchen, Jesus says that in fact, "Mary has chosen what is better" ({{Bibleverse||Luke|10:38-42|NIV}}, [[New International Version]]). The scene has inspired much Christian art.  . 

According to historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], women were probably the majority of Christians in the first century after Christ. The First Century [[Apostle Paul]] emphasised a faith open to all  in his [[Letter to the Galatians]]:<ref>Geoffrey Blainey; ''A Very Short History of the World''; Penguin Books, 2004</ref> . 

{{cquote|There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Jesus Christ.}} . 

Other writings ascribed to Paul appear to both recognise women leadership in the early Church ([[Romans 16]]) and to put limits upon it ([[1 Timothy 2:12]]).  . 

According to the [[Acts of the Apostles|Book of Acts]], the early church attracted significant numbers of women; many of these were prominent in cultures that afforded women more substantial roles than Judaism did.  According to Alister McGrath, Christianity had the effect of undermining traditional roles of both women and slaves in two ways: . 

#By asserting that all were "one in Christ", regardless of whether they were Jew or Gentile, male or female, master or slave. 
#By asserting that all could share in Christian fellowship and worship together, once again regardless of whether they were Jew or Gentile, male or female, master or slave.  . 

McGrath describes Paul's egalitarian approach as "profoundly liberating" in that it implied new freedoms for women. <ref>{{cite book |title=An introduction to Christianity |first=Alister E. |last=McGrath |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=1997 |page=238 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hclaXvhwBiUC&pg=PA238&dq=%22Early+Christianity%22+women&hl=en&ei=YZ8LTuq1N-bfiAKGneHjAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CE8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22Early%20Christianity%22%20women&f=false}}</ref> . 

McGrath comments that, although Christianity did not effect an immediate change in cultural attitudes towards women, the effect of Paul's egalitarianism was to "place a theoretical time bomb under them."  He asserts that, ultimately, "the foundations of these traditional distinctions would be eroded to the point where they could no longer be maintained."<ref>{{cite book |title=An introduction to Christianity |first=Alister E.|last=McGrath |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=1997 |page=240 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hclaXvhwBiUC&pg=PA240&dq=%22Early+Christianity%22+women&hl=en&ei=YZ8LTuq1N-bfiAKGneHjAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CE8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22Early%20Christianity%22%20women&f=false}}</ref>  Similarly, Suzanne Wemple notes that, although Christianity did not eliminate sexual discrimination in the late Roman Empire, it did offer women "the opportunity to regard themselves as independent personalities rather than as someone else's daughter, wife, or mother". <ref>{{cite book |title=Women in Frankish society: marriage and the cloister, 500 to 900 |first=Suzanne Fonay |last=Wemple |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=1985 |page=19 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hNgzAW0YVxEC&pg=PA19&dq=%22Early+Christianity%22+women&hl=en&ei=HKMLTs6wMaTdiAK1_5HeAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=%22Early%20Christianity%22%20women&f=false}}</ref> . 

Women commemorated as saints from these early centuries include several martyrs who suffered under the  [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire]], such as [[Agnes of Rome]], [[Saint Cecilia]], [[Agatha of Sicily]] and [[Blandina]]. In late Antiquity, [[Helena (Empress)|Saint Helena]] was a Christian and consort of [[Emperor Constantius]], and the mother of [[Emperor Constantine I]]. As such her role in history is of great significance as her son Constantine legalised Christianity across the Roman Empire, and became a convert himself - ending centuries of mistreatment of Christians and altering the course of world history. Similarly, [[Saint Monica]] was a pious Christian and mother of [[Saint Augustine of Hippo]], who after a wayward youth, converted to Christianity and became one of the most influential Christian Theologians of all history.  . 

===Medieval era===. 
[[File:Simone Martini 047.jpg|thumb|upright|left|St. [[Clare of Assisi]] played an important role in the 13th Century [[Franciscan]] movement.]] . 

As Western Europe transitioned from the Classical to Medieval Age, the male hierarchy with the Pope as its summit became a central player in European politics, however many women leaders also emerged at various levels within the Church. Mysticism flourished and monastic convents and communities of Catholic women became powerful institutions within Europe. [[Marian devotion]] blossomed, setting a model of maternal virtue at the heart of Western civilization.  .

Petra Munro contrasts the early Christian Church as being inclusive of women as opposed to the medieval Church which she describes as being "based on a gender hierarchy". <ref name=Munro65>{{cite book |title=Engendering Curriculum History |first=Petra |last=Munro |publisher=Routledge |year=2011 |page=65 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-P14RfMD-scC&pg=PA65&dq=%22Catholic+Church%22+women+spirituality+mysticism+history&hl=en&ei=TpwMTp3_A9LSiAKQmeD7DQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Catholic%20Church%22%20women%20spirituality%20mysticism%20history&f=false}}</ref> . 

The historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], however, writes that women were in fact more prominent in the life of the Church during the Middle Ages than at any previous time in its history, with a number of church reforms initiated by women. The Belgian nun, St [[Juliana of Liège]] (1193–1252), proposed the [[Feast of Corpus Christi]], celebrating the body of Christ in the Eucharist,  which became a major feast throughout the Church. In the 13th Century, authors began to write of a mythical female pope - [[Pope Joan]] - who managed to disguise her gender until giving birth during a procession in Rome. <ref>Geoffrey Blainey; ''A Short History of Christianity''; Penguin Viking; 2011; p 152. </ref>  Blainey cites the ever growing veneration of the Virgin Mary and [[Mary Magdalene]] as evidence of a high standing for female Christians at that time. The Virgin Mary, was conferred such titles as Mother of God and Queen of Heaven and, in 863, her feast day, the "Feast of Our Lady", was declared equal in importance to those of Easter and Christmas. Mary Magdalene's Feast Day was celebrated in earnest from the 8th century on and composite portraits of her were built up from Gospel references to other women Jesus met. <ref>Geoffrey Blainey; ''A Short History of Christianity''; Penguin Viking; 2011; pp 155-159. </ref>  . 

According to historian [[Shulamith Shahar]], "[s]ome historians hold that the Church played a considerable part in fostering the inferior status of women in medieval society in general" by providing a "moral justification" for male superiority and by accepting practices such as wife-beating. <ref name=shahar88>Shahar (2003), p. 88. "The ecclesiastical conception of the inferior status of women, deriving from Creation, her role in Original Sin and her subjugation to man, provided both direct and indirect justification for her inferior standing in the family and in society in medieval civilization. It was not the Church which induced husbands to beat their wives, but it not only accepted this custom after the event, if it was not carried to excess, but, by proclaiming the superiority of man, also supplied its moral justification."</ref>  Despite these laws, some women, particularly [[abbess]]es, gained powers that were never available to women in previous Roman or Germanic societies. <ref name=shahar12>Shahar (2003), p. 12. </ref> . 

Although these teachings emboldened secular authorities to give women fewer rights than men, they also helped form the concept of [[chivalry]]. <ref>Power (1995), p. 2. </ref>  Chivalry was influenced by a new Church attitude towards Mary, the mother of Jesus. <ref name=shahar25>Shahar (2003), p. 25. </ref>  This "ambivalence about women's very nature" was shared by most major religions in the Western world. <ref name=bitel102>Bitel (2002), p. 102. </ref>  The development of [[Marian devotions]] and the image of the Virgin Mary as the "second Eve" also influenced the status of women during the Middle Ages. The increasing popularity of [[Roman Catholic Mariology|devotion to the Virgin Mary]] (the mother of Jesus) secured maternal virtue as a central cultural theme of Catholic Europe. [[Art historian]] [[Kenneth Clarke]] wrote that the 'Cult of the Virgin' in the early 12th century "had taught a race of tough and ruthless barbarians the virtues of tenderness and compassion". <ref>[[Kenneth Clarke]]; ''Civilisation'', BBC, SBN 563 10279 9; first published 1969. </ref> . 

Women who had been looked down upon as daughters of [[Eve]], came to be looked upon as objects of veneration and inspiration. The medieval development of [[chivalry]], with the concept of the honor of a lady and the ensuing knightly devotion to it, was not only derived from [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Mariological]] thinking, but also contributed to it. <ref>{{cite book |title=International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: K-P |first=Geoffrey W. |last=Bromiley |year=1994 |ISBN=0802837832 |page=272}}</ref> The medieval veneration of the Virgin Mary was contrasted by the fact that ordinary women, specially those outside aristocratic circles were looked down upon, and at a time when women could be viewed as the source of evil, the concept of the Virgin Mary as mediator to God positioned her as a source of refuge for man, affecting the changing attitudes towards women. <ref>{{cite book |title=Daughters of the church |year=1987 |first=Ruth |last=Tucker |ISBN=0310457416 |page=168}}</ref> . 

While non-aristocratic women were in many respects excluded from political and mercantile life in the Middle Ages, leading churchwomen were an exception. Medieval abbesses and female superiors of monastic houses were powerful figures whose influence could rival that of male bishops and abbots: "They treated with kings, bishops, and the greatest lords on terms of perfect equality;. . . they were present at all great religious and national solemnities, at the dedication of churches, and even, like the queens, took part in the deliberation of the national assemblies...". <ref>http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01007e.htm (Montalembert, "The Monks of the West," Bk. XV.)</ref>  . 

Irish [[hagiography]] holds that, as Europe was entering the Medieval Age, the abbess St. [[Brigit of Kildare]] was founding monasteries across Ireland. The Celtic Church played an important role in restoring Christianity to Western Europe following the [[Fall of Rome]], thus the work of nuns like Brigid is significant in Christian history. <ref>http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02784b.htm</ref> . 

In the important [[Franciscan]] movement of the thirteenth century, a significant part was played by religious women. St. [[Clare of Assisi]] was one of the first followers of [[Saint Francis of Assisi]]. She founded the [[Order of Poor Ladies]], a contemplative [[Monasticism|monastic]] [[religious order]] for women in the [[Franciscan]] tradition, and wrote their Rule of Life—the first monastic rule known to have been written by a woman. Following her death, the order she founded was renamed in her honor as the Order of Saint Clare, commonly referred to today as the [[Poor Clares]]. <ref>http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12251b.htm</ref> . 

St. [[Catherine of Sienna]] (1347–1380) was a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] tertiary and mystic of considerable influence who was proclaimed a [[Doctor_of_the_church#Catholicism|Doctor of the Church]] in 1970. Considered by her contemporaries to have high levels of spiritual insight, she worked with the sick and poor, experienced "visions", gathered disciples and participated in the highest levels of public life through letters to the princes of Italy, consultations with papal legates and by acting as a diplomat negotiating between the city states of Italy. She counseled for reform of the clergy and was influential in convincing Pope Gregory XI to leave Avignon and restore the [[Holy See]] to Rome. <ref>http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03447a.htm</ref> . 

According to Bynum, there was an unprecedented flowering of mysticism among female members of religious orders in the Catholic Church during the 12th through 15th centuries.  Petra Munro describes these women as "trangressing gender norms" by violating the dictates of the [[Apostle Paul]] that "women should not speak, teach or have authority" (1 Timothy 2:12).  Munro notes that, although the number of female mystics was "significant", we tend to be more familiar with male figures such as [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], [[Francis of Assisi]], [[Thomas Acquinas]] or [[Meister Eckhart]] than with [[Hildegard of Bingen]], [[Julian of Norwich]], [[Mechthild of Magdeburg]], [[Hadewijch of Antwerp]] or [[Teresa of Avila]]. <ref name=Munro65 />  . 

An example is provided by the 12th century [[Speculum Virginum]] (''Mirror of Virgins'' in Latin) document which  provides one of the earliest comprehensive theologies of cloistered religious life. <ref>Sorrentino, Janet ''[[The Medieval Review]]'' April 12, 2001 [https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/5739/04.12.01.html?sequence=1 Medieval Review at Indiana University]</ref> The growth of the various manuscript of the Speculum Virginum in the Middle Ages had a particular resonance for women who sought a dedicated religious life. Yet, it not only impacted the development of female monastic life, but in turn influenced the proliferation of male monastic orders. <ref>''Listen daughter: the Speculum virginum and the formation of religious women'' by Constant J. Mews 2001 ISBN 0312240082 pages vii and 1</ref> These monastic orders came to include key Catholic figures such as [[Doctor of the Church]] [[Teresa of Ávila]], whose influence on practices such as [[Christian meditation]] continues to date. <ref name="Harvey D page 413"/><ref>''Teresa of Avila'' by [[Rowan Williams]] 1991 ISBN 0826473415 page vii</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14515b.htm|title=St. Teresa of Avila|work=[[Catholic encyclopedia]]|accessdate=14 April 2010}}</ref> . 

Arguably the most famous female Catholic Saint of the period is St. [[Joan of Arc]]. Considered a national [[heroine]] of France, she began life as a pious peasant girl. As with other saints of the period, Joan is said to have experienced supernatural dialogues which gave her spiritual insight and directed her actions - but unlike typical heroins of the period, she donned male attire and, claiming divine guidance, sought out the King [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] of France to offer help in a military campaign against the English. Taking up a sword, she achieved military victories, before being captured. Her English captors and their Burgundian allies then arranged for her to be tried as a "witch and heretic", after which she was [[burned at the stake]]. A papal inquiry later declared the trial illegal. A hero to the French, sympathy grew for Joan even in England and in 1909 she was canonised a saint. <ref>http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08409c.htm</ref> She remains an important figure in Western culture.  . 

===Catholic Monarchs=== . 

[[File:Jadwiga by Bacciarelli.jpg|left|thumb|Saint [[Jadwiga of Poland]] is the patron saint of queens.]] . 

Through history there have been many notable female Catholic monarchs. Among the most notable of all Christian noblewomen must be [[Helena (Empress)|Helena of Constantinople]], the mother of the [[Emperor Constantine]]. Constantine's  [[Edict of Milan]] of 303AD ended the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire and his own conversion to Christianity was a significant turning point in history. <ref>Religion in the Roman Empire, Wiley-Blackwell, by James B. Rives, page 196</ref> A network of European monarchies established power throughout Western Europe through the Medieval period. Men were generally given precedence to reign as monarch, however aristocratic women could achieve influence.  . 

[[File:Isabel la Católica-2.jpg|thumb|upright|Queen [[Isabella I of Castille]] (''Isabella the Catholic'') helped unify Spain and spread Catholicism to the Americas.]]
[[File:Kaiserin Maria Theresia (HRR).jpg|upright|thumb|[[Maria Theresa of Austria]] was [[Holy Roman Empress]] and a powerful figure in Central European politics.]] . 

The first Russian ruler to convert to Christianity was [[Olga of Kiev]] around 950AD. She is an important figure in the spread of Christianity to Russia and remembered as a saint by the Catholic and Orthodox churches alike. Italian noblewoman [[Matilda of Tuscany]] (1046–1115) is remembered for her military accomplishments and for being  the principal Italian supporter of [[Pope Gregory VII]] during the [[Investiture Controversy]]. Saint [[Hedwig of Silesia]] (1174–1243) supported the poor and the church in Eastern Europe and [[Jadwiga of Poland]] reigned as monarch of Poland and is the patron saint of queens and of a "united Europe". <ref>http://www.talismancoins.com/servlet/Detail?no=416</ref> Saint [[Elisabeth of Hungary]] (1207–1231) was a symbol of Christian charity who used her wealth to establish hospitals and care for the poor. Each of these women were singled out as model Christians by Pope John Paul II in his [[Mulieris Dignitatem]] letter on the dignity and vocation of women. <ref>http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_15081988_mulieris-dignitatem_en.html</ref> . 

As sponsor of [[Christopher Columbus]]' 1492 mission to cross the Atlantic, the Spanish [[Queen Isabella I]] of Castille (known as ''Isabella the Catholic''), was an important figure in the growth of Catholicism as a global religion, for Spain and Portugal followed Columbus' route to establish vast Empires in the Americas. Her marriage to Ferdinand II of Aragon had ensured the unity of the Spanish Kingdom and the royal couple agreed to hold equal authority. Spanish Pope [[Alexander VI]] conferred on them the title "Catholic". As part of legal reforms to consolidate their authority, Isablla and Ferdinand instigated the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. The Catholic Monarchs then conquered the last Moorish bastion in Spain at [[Granada]] in January 1492 and seven months later, Columbus sailed for the Americas. The Catholic encyclopedia, credits Isabella as an extremely able ruler and one who "fostered learning not only in the universities and among the nobles, but also among women". Of Isabella and Ferdinand, it says: "The good government of the Catholic sovereigns brought the prosperity of Spain to its apogee, and inaugurated that country's Golden Age". <ref>http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08177a.htm</ref> . 

[[The Reformation]] swept through Europe during the 16th Century, ending centuries of unity among Western [[Christendom]] and bringing [[Protestantism]] into being as both a political and religious opponent of [[Catholicism]]. For the first time in centuries, the religion of an heir to the throne became an intensely important political issue. The refusal of Pope [[Clement VI]] to grant an annulment in the marriage of [[King Henry VIII]] to [[Catherine of Aragon]] saw [[English Reformation|Henry establish himself as supreme governor]] of the church in England. Rivalry between Catholic and Protestant heirs ensued. [[Mary I of England]], was his eldest daughter and succeeded the throne after the death of her Protestant younger half brother [[Edward VI]]. Later nicknamed "Bloody Mary" for her actions against Protestants, she  was the daughter of Catherine of Aragon, and thus remained loyal to Rome and sought to restore the Roman Church in England. Her re-establishment of Roman Catholicism was reversed after her death in 1558 by her successor and younger half-sister, [[Elizabeth I]]. Rivalry emerged between Elizabeth and the Catholic [[Mary Queen of Scots]], finally settled with the execution of Mary in 1587. The religion of an heir or monarch's spouse complicated intermarriage between royal houses through coming centuries.  . 

Consorts of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s were given the title of [[Holy Roman Empress]]. The throne was reserved for males, thus there was never a Holy Roman Empress regnant, though women such as [[Theophanu]] and [[Maria Theresa of Austria]], controlled the power of rule and served as de facto Empresses regnant. The powerful Maria Theresa acquired her right to the throne of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Hapsburg dominions]] by means of the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]], allowing for female succession - but had to fight the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] to secure her right to reign. Following victories, her husband, [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis Stephen]], was chosen as Holy Roman Emperor in  1745, confirming Maria Theresa's status as a European leader. A liberal-minded autocrat, she was a patron of sciences and education and sought to alleviate the suffering of the serfs. On religion she pursued a policy of [[cujus regio, ejus religio]], keeping Catholic observance at court and frowning on Judaism and Protestantism - but the ascent of her son as co-regnant Emperor saw restrictions placed on the power of the Church in the Empire. She reigned for 40 years, and mothered 16 children including [[Marie-Antoinette]], the ill-fated Queen of France. <ref>http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09662d.htm</ref> With her husband she founded the Catholic [[House of Lorraine|Habsburg-Lorraine Dynasty]] who remained central players in European politics into the 20th century.  . 

Of the remaining European monarchies, all are now constitutional monarchies, with some still ruled by Catholic dynasties, including the [[Spanish Royal Family|Spanish]] and [[Belgian Royal Family|Belgian Royal Families]] and the [[House of Grimaldi]]. Many non-aristocratic Catholic women have served in public office in the modern era.  .

Amidst the backdrop of [[Industrial Revolution]] and expanding European Empires, a number of notable educational and nursing [[religious orders]] were established by or for Catholic women during the 17th-19th centuries, and catholic women played a central role in the developing or running of many the modern world's education and health care systems.  .

With Catholicism spreading to the New World, [[Rose of Lima]], the first Catholic saint of the Americas was born in Peru in 1586, and became known for her piety. In 1774, Saint [[Elizabeth Ann Seton]] was born in New York. She would become the first saint born in the newly declared United States of America. A Catholic convert, she was attratced to the spirituality of St. Vincent de Paul and founded a religious community dedicated to the care of the children of the poor - the first congregation of religious sisters founded in the USA.  . 

The [[Sisters of Mercy]] was founded by [[Catherine McAuley]] in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]] in 1831, and her nuns went on to establish hospitals and schools across the world. <ref>http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Sisters_of_Mercy</ref> The [[Little Sisters of the Poor]] was founded in the mid-19th century by Saint [[Jeanne Jugan]] near Rennes, France, to care for the many impoverished elderly who lined the streets of French towns and cities. <ref>http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12248a.htm</ref><ref>http://news.fr.msn.com/m6-actualite/article.aspx?cp-documentid=150143558</ref> In Britain's Australian colonies, Australia's first canonised Saint, [[Mary MacKillop]], co-founded the [[Sisters of St. Joseph of the Sacred Heart]] as an educative order for the poor in 1866. Tension with the local male hierarchy culminated in the local archbishop attempting to excommunicate her but [[Pope Pius IX]]'s personal approval permitted her to continue her work and by the time of her death her order had established a 117 schools and had opened orphanages and refuges for the needy. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/national/mary-mackillop-to-become-australias-first-saint-on-october-17/story-e6frfkvr-1225832369178 | work=news.com.au | title=Mary MacKillop to become Australia's first saint on October 17 | date=19 February 2010}}</ref>  . 

The spread of a number of key [[Roman Catholic devotions]] are due to women in religious orders. A well known example is the impact of [[Margaret Marie Alacoque]] on the devotion to the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]]. <ref name=Barry72 >''Life of Blessed Margaret Mary Alacoque of the Sacred Heart'' by Albert Barry 2008 ISBN 1-4097-0526-9 page 72</ref> Although various devotions to the Sacred heart had been practiced as early as the second century, and Saint [[John Eudes]] had written about it shortly before Saint Margaret, her reported 1673 visions of Jesus were instrumental in establishing the modern devotion. <ref name=Barry72 /><ref>''Roman Catholic worship: Trent to today'' by James F. White 2003 ISBN 0-8146-6194-7 page 34</ref><ref>''From Trent to Vatican II: historical and theological investigations by Raymond F. Bulman, Frederick J. Parrella 2006 ISBN 0-19-517807-6 page 182</ref><ref>''Praying with the saints'' by Woodeene Koenig-Bricker 2001 ISBN 0-8294-1755-9 page 134</ref>   . 

Moreover, Saint Margaret established the devotion for receiving [[Holy Communion]] as the [[First Friday Devotions]] for each month, and [[Eucharistic adoration]] during the [[Holy hour|Holy Hour]] on Thursdays, and the celebration of the [[Feast of the Sacred Heart]]. <ref name="Oxford">Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 ISBN 978-0-19-280290-3): article ''Margaret Mary Alacoque, St''</ref> She stated that in her vision she was instructed to spend an hour every Thursday night to meditate on the sufferings of Jesus in the [[Agony in the Garden|Garden of Gethsemane]]. The [[Holy Hour]] practice later became widespread among Catholics. <ref>Ann Ball, 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices ISBN 0-87973-910-X page 240</ref><ref>''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Spirituality'' by Gordon S. Wakefield 1983 ISBN 066422170X page 347</ref><ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09653a.htm Catholic encyclopedia]</ref> . 

The Sacred Heart devotion was later influenced by another Catholic nun, [[Mary of the Divine Heart]] who initiated the first act of consecration for non-Christians. In 1898, through her superiors, she wrote to Pope [[Leo XIII]] that she had received a message from Christ, requesting the pope to consecrate the entire world to the [[Sacred Heart]]. The pope did not comply, but in a second letter she referred to the recent illness of the pope in a way that the pope was convinced, despite the theological issues concerning the consecration of non-Christians. <ref>Laurent Volken, 1963, ''Visions, Revelations and the Church'' P.J. Kenedy Publishers</ref><ref>Niels Christian Hvidt, 2007, ''Christian Prophecy: The Post-Biblical Tradition'', OUP Press ISBN 0195314476 page 242</ref> Leo XIII referred to the issue in the 1899 encyclical ''[[Annum Sacrum]]'' in which he included the [[Prayer of Consecration to the Sacred Heart]] he composed as a result.:<ref>Vatican website: ''[[Annum Sacrum]]'' [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_25051899_annum-sacrum_en.html]</ref> Leo XIII called the consecration which Sister Mary had requested "the greatest act of my pontificate". <ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07163a.htm Catholic encyclopedia]</ref> . 

Sister [[Marie of St. Peter]], a Carmelite nun in [[Tours]] France started the devotion to the [[Holy Face of Jesus]] in 1843. She also wrote of the ''[[The Golden Arrow Holy Face Devotion (Prayer)|Golden Arrow Prayer]]''. <ref>Ann Ball, 2003 ''Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices'' ISBN 087973910X pages 635 and 239</ref> The devotion was further promoted by Blessed [[Maria Pierina]] and the Holy Face Medal was approved by pope [[Pius XII]] who based on the devotions started by the two nuns formally declared the Feast of the Holy Face of Jesus as Shrove Tuesday. <ref>Joan Carroll Cruz, OCDS, 2003, ''Saintly Men of Modern Times'' ISBN 1931709777 page 200</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/holy-face-nun-beatified-remembered-by-pope-benedict-xvi/ |title=Holy Face nun beatified, remembered by Pope Benedict XVI |date=May 30, 2010 |publisher= [[Catholic News Agency]]}}</ref> . 

Not all women who have impacted Catholic devotional practices have been nuns at the time of the establishment of the devotion. When in 1858 Saint [[Bernadette Soubirous]] reported the [[Our Lady of Lourdes|Lourdes apparitions]] she was a 14 year old shepherd girl. <ref name=Phyllis816 >''Holy people of the world: a cross-cultural encyclopedia'', Volume 3 by Phyllis G. Jestice 2004 ISBN 1576073556 page 816</ref> She asked the local priest to build a local chapel in Lourdes because the Lady with the Rosary beads had requested it. Eventually, a number of chapels and churches were built at Lourdes as the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes]] - which is now a major Catholic pilgrimage site with about five million pilgrims a year. <ref>''Every pilgrim's guide to Lourdes'' by Sally Martin 2005 ISBN 1853116270 page vii</ref> . 

===20th century===. 
{{Expand section|date=June 2011}} . 

[[File:Therese.jpg|thumb|left|[[St. Thérèse of Lisieux]] (1873-1897) was one of three women to be named "[[Doctor of the Church]] during the 20th Century.]] . 

For much of the early Twentieth century, Catholic women continued to join religious orders in large numbers, where their influence and control was particularly strong in the running of primary education for children, high schooling for girls, and in nursing, hospitals, orphanages and aged care facilities. The [[Second Vatican Council]] of the 1960s liberalised the strictures of Catholic religious life, particularly for women in holy orders,  however, in the latter half of the 20th century, vocations for women in the West entered a steep decline.  . 

[[File:J Bakhita.jpg|thumb|upright|St. [[Josephine Bakhita]], was a Sudanese slave girl who became a nun. By the 20th century, Catholicism's reach was truly global.]]

[[File:HelenPrejean.jpg|thumb|upright|Anti-Death Penalty crusader Sister [[Helen Prejean]] in 2006.]] . 

The 20th century saw a large number of beatifications and canonisations of Catholic women. Their places of origin reveal something of the global nature of Catholicism in the 20th century: St. [[Josephine Bakhita]] was a Sudanese slave girl who became a  [[Canossians|Canossian nun]]; St. [[Mary McKillop]]'s Josephite sisters established their network of schools across [[Australasia]]; St. [[Katharine Drexel]] (1858–1955) worked for Native and African Americans; Polish mystic St. [[Maria Faustina Kowalska]] (1905–1938) wrote her influential spiritual diary;<ref>http://www.americancatholic.org/newsletters/wst/ap0407.asp</ref> and German nun [[Edith Stein]] was murdered by the Nazis at [[Auschwitz]]. <ref>http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_19981011_edith_stein_en.html</ref>  . 

While the Vatican made plain its disapproval of Nazism with its 1937 encyclical [[Mit brennender Sorge]] (written in German, meaning ''With burning concern''), by 1941, Nazi armies and their allies occupied all Europe. Many Catholic women died as martyrs or faced persecution or imprisonment across Europe. Catholic Poland suffered miserably under Nazi occupation, and a number of women are recognised for their heroism and martyrdom during the period: including 8 religious sisters and several laywomen of Poland's [[108 Martyrs of World War II]] and the 11 [[Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth]] murdered by the Gestapo in 1943 and known as the [[Blessed Martyrs of Nowogródek]]. <ref>http://www.phila-csfn.org/sister.htm</ref> Swedish born [[Elisabeth Hesselblad]]  was listed among the “[[List of Righteous among the Nations by country|righteous among the nations]]” by [[Yad Vashem]] for her order's work assisting Jews escape [[The Holocaust]]. <ref>http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2010/07/08/niece-astonished-as-cause-of-sister-katherine-advances/</ref> She and two British women, Mother [[Riccarda Beauchamp Hambrough]] and Sister [[Katherine Flanagan]] have been beatified for reviving the Swedish Bridgettine Order of nuns and hiding scores of Jewish families in their convent during Rome's period of occupation under the Nazis. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/british-nuns-who-saved-wartime-jews-on-path-to-sainthood-1988875.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Jerome | last=Taylor | date=2 June 2010}}</ref> . 

In the latter 20th Century and following the Second Vatican Council, three Catholic women were declared [[Doctors of the Church]]: the 16th Century Spanish mystic, [[St. Teresa of Ávila]]; the 14th Century Italian mystic [[St. Catherine of Siena]] and the 19th century French nun [[St. Thérèse de Lisieux]] (called ''Doctor Amoris'' or Doctor of Love).  . 

In the developing world, people continued to convert to Catholicism in large numbers. Among the most famous women missionaries of the period was [[Mother Teresa]] of calcutta, who was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1979 for her work in "bringing help to suffering humanity". <ref>http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1979/press.html</ref> Much admired by Pope John Paul II, she was [[beatification|beatified]] in 2003, just six years after her death. <ref>http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20031019_index_madre-teresa_en.html</ref> . 

In Western nations like America, Catholic women continued to be heavily involved in areas like health and education, but a decline of religious orders accompanied the 20th century's women’s movement, sexual revolution, ethnic assimilation and the [[Second Vatican Council]]’s opening of the church to lay leadership. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/us/21nuns.html?pagewanted=1&_r=2&smid=fb-nytimes | work=The New York Times | first=Kevin | last=Sack | title=Nuns, a ‘Dying Breed,' Fade From Leadership Roles at Catholic Hospitals | date=20 August 2011}}</ref> . 

Social attitudes to sex and marriage in the West moved away from traditional Catholic teachings and  Western governments also liberalized laws relating to [[abortion]]. In the face of the [[HIV AIDS]] epidemic that emerged in the 1980s, the Church maintained its traditional stance that pre-marital abstinence, rather than contraception was the best preventative action. Catholic women became heavily involved in establishing hospices to care for AIDS patients, as with the [[Sisters of Charity]] who established Australia's first AIDS clinic at  [[St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney]]. <ref>http://exwwwsvh.stvincents.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=132&Itemid=160</ref> The impact of the disease had been largely controlled in the Developed World by the turn of the century, but continued to spread in the Developing World, where the church remains active in patient care.  . 

While a modern [[feminist theology]] developed, the long reigning [[Pope John Paul II]] emphasized traditional roles for women within the church and in his [[Ordinatio Sacerdotalis]] of 1994, declared that the Church "has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the Church's faithful''. <ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/pope/johnpaulii_1.shtml</ref>  . 

Many Catholic women and religious have been prominent advocates in social policy debates - as with American nun [[Helen Prejean]], a [[Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille|Sister of Saint Joseph of Medaille]], who is a prominent campaigner against the [[Death Penalty]] and was the inspiration for the Hollywood film [[Dead Man Walking (film)|Dead Man Walking]]. <ref>http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s2034720.htm</ref> . 

===Current status===. 
{{see|New feminism}} . 

According to Catherine Wessinger, Catholic lay women have been increasingly called to play important roles in the Catholic Church; this trend is particularly strong in the United States. <ref>{{cite book |title=Religious institutions and women's leadership: new roles inside the mainstream |first=Catherine|last=Wessinger |publisher=University of South Carolina Press|year=1996 |page=21 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uAkrJqbaPJQC&pg=PA21&dq=%22Catholic+Church%22+women&hl=en&ei=wYYGTuWcF5PUtQOn1a3WDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CFAQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&q=%22Catholic%20Church%22%20women&f=false}}</ref> . 

Cynthia Stewart asserts that, although the hierarchy of the Church is entirely male as a result of the [[Catholic Church doctrine on the ordination of women|restriction against ordination of women]], the vast majority of Catholics that participate in lay ministry are women.  According to Stewart, approximately 85 percent of all Church roles that do not require ordination are performed by women. <ref name=Stewart322>{{cite book |title=The Catholic Church: A Brief Popular History|first=Cynthia |last=Stewart |publisher=Saint Mary's Press|year=2008|page=322|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZBZNXBWqdgEC&pg=PA322&dq=%22Catholic+Church%22+lay+women&hl=en&ei=YE4LTvDMOcvbiAKq_-jjAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22Catholic%20Church%22%20lay%20women&f=false}}</ref> Catherine Stewart identifies several reasons for the increased role that lay women play in the Catholic Church:
#a shift in cultural attitudes leading to greater acceptance of women in leadership roles
#an increase in outreach ministries targeted at groups with whom women have traditionally worked (e.g. elderly and children)
#a greater willingness on the part of women to accept lower salaries than those offered by the secular world. <ref name=Stewart322 /> . 

The importance of women to the "life and mission of the Church" was emphasized by Pope John Paul II who wrote:
<blockquote>
"The presence and the role of women in the life and mission of the Church, although not linked to the ministerial priesthood, remain absolutely necessary and irreplaceable.  As the Declaration Inter Insigniores points out, 'The Church desires that Christian women should become fully aware of the greatness of their mission: today their role is of capital importance both for the renewal and humanization of society and for the rediscovery by believers of the true face of the Church' " ( No. 10). <ref>Ordinatio Sacerdotalis, Pope John Paul II</ref>
</blockquote> . 

[[New feminism]] is a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] philosophy which emphasizes a belief in an integral[[Complementarianism|complementarity]] of men and women, rather than the superiority of men over women or women over men. <ref>[Allen, Sr. Prudence Allen. 'Man-Woman Complementarity: the Catholic Inspiration.'  ''Logos'' 9, issue 3 (Summer 2006)http://www.endowonline.com/File/spComplementary.pdf]</ref>  New feminism, as a form of [[difference feminism]], supports the idea that men and women have different strengths, perspectives, and roles, while advocating for the equal worth and dignity of both sexes. Among its basic concepts are that the most important differences are those that are biological rather than cultural. New Feminism holds that women should be valued as child bearers, home makers but also as individuals with equal worth to men. <ref>{{cite book |title=

[[File:Raphael Madonna of Loreto.jpg|thumb|''Madonna of Loreto'' by [[Raphael]].]] . 

[[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] was the mother of Jesus, and as such is highly venerated within the Catholic Church as the "Mother of God". The Church holds that she herself was [[Immaculate Conception|Immaculately Conceived]]. Whilst betrothed to the carpenter [[Saint Joseph]], Mary was [[Annunciation|visited by]] the [[Archangel Gabriel|angel Gabriel]], who announced that though she was a virgin she would give birth to a son - Jesus. <ref>http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01541c.htm</ref> The Gospels give several other accounts of Mary, including that she was present at the feet of Jesus at the time of his [[crucifiction]]. These verses have inspired vast quantities of Catholic art - notably images of the [[Madonna and Child]] - and various Catholic prayers (notably [[Hail Mary]]/[[Ave Maria]]): . 

{{cquote|
:Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. 
:Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. 
}}
The prominence of Mary in the life of the Church grew gradually. In AD 431, the [[Council of Ephesus]] granted Mary the title of "Mother of God". In 533, the [[Council of Constantinople]], proclaimed that she was perpetually a virgin. By 863, the [[Feast of Our Lady]] was declared by the Pope to be equal in importance to Christmas and Easter and by the 12th Century, the Hail Mary prayer had become popular, which in turn led to the widespread use of the [[rosary]]. According to historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], Mary had become the "favoured intermediary through whom the ear of God could be reached". She had become an important subject for theologians and artists alike and churches were named after her throughout Christendom. She became known as "Queen of Heaven". <ref>Geoffrey Blainey; ''A Short History of Christianity''; Penguin Viking; 2011</ref> . 

Mary Reichardt comments that the Blessed Virgin Mary is "paradoxically, both virgin and mother, both submissive and the preeminent ''mulier fortis''". <ref name=ReichardtIntroduction>{{cite book |title=Catholic women writers: a bio-bibliographical sourcebook |first=Mary R. |last=Reichardt |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2001 |page=xxviii |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mpc53LXRvIQC&pg=PR28&dq=%22Catholic+Church%22+women+spirituality+mysticism&hl=en&ei=15AMTry2IrDRiAKLkrmBDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDQQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=%22Catholic%20Church%22%20women%20spirituality%20mysticism&f=false}}</ref> . 

As the mother of Jesus, Mary has a central role in the life of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Within the Catholic Church, the Virgin Mary is seen, not only as the ''Mother of God'' but also as the ''Mother of the Church''. By the early Middle Ages, Marian devotion had become an integral part of Church life. <ref>http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15459a.htm</ref>  The Roman Catholic veneration of her as the ''Blessed Virgin Mary'' has grown over time both in importance and manifestation, not only in prayer but in art, poetry and music. <ref>Santa Maria articlehttp://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,730158-1,00.html</ref><ref>''Merriam-Webster's encyclopedia of world religions'' by Wendy Doniger, 1999 ISBN 0877790442 page 696 [http://books.google.com/books?id=ZP_f9icf2roC&pg=PA696&dq=art+veneration+virgin+mary&hl=en&ei=112ZTJyCE8rLswbk2aWsDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCkQ6AEwATg8#v=onepage&q=art%20veneration%20virgin%20mary&f=false]</ref><ref>''Symbolic scores: studies in the music of the Renaissance'' by Willem Elders 1997 ISBN 9004099700 page 151 [http://books.google.com/books?id=UFFJb3uNxdUC&pg=PA151&dq=art+veneration+virgin+mary&hl=en&ei=tGKZTIvnB8yOswangKWsDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCQQ6AEwADhQ#v=onepage&q=art%20veneration%20virgin%20mary&f=false]</ref><ref>''Maiden and mother: Prayers, hymns, devotions, and songs to the Beloved Virgin Mary Throughout the Year'' by Margaret M.

Flinn, J.

Since the end of the 19th century, a number of progressive and liberal perspectives of Mariology have been presented, ranging from feminist criticisms to interpretations based on modern psychology and liberal Catholic viewpoints. These views are generally critical of the Roman Catholic approach to Mariology as well as the [[Eastern Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches which have even more Marian emphasis within their official liturgies. <ref name=Snodgrass >''Encyclopedia of feminist literature'' by Mary Ellen Snodgrass 2006 ISBN 0816060401 page 547</ref><ref name=Tavard /><ref>''Mary is for Everyone'' by William McLoughlin, Jill Pinnock 1998 ISBN 085244429X page 183</ref> . 

Some feminists contend that as with other women saints such as [[Joan of Arc]] the image of Mary is a construct of the patriarchal mind. They argue that Marian dogmas and doctrines and the typical forms of Marian devotion reinforce patriarchy by offering women temporary comfort from the ongoing opperession inflicted on them by male dominated churches and societies. <ref name=Tavard >''The thousand faces of the Virgin Mary'' by George Henry Tavard 1996 ISBN 0814659144 page 253</ref> In the feminist view, old gender stereotypes persist within traditional Marian teachings and theological doctrines. To that end books on "feminist Mariology" have been published to present opposing interpretations and perspectives. <ref name= JillLevine >''A feminist companion to Mariology'' by [[Amy-Jill Levine]], Maria Mayo Robbins 2005 ISBN 0826466613 page 147</ref> . 

Since the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] many Christians have opposed Marian venerations and that trend has continued into the 21st century among progressive and liberal Christians who see the high level of attention paid to the Virgin Mary both as being without sufficient grounding in [[Scripture]] and as distraction from the worship due to [[Christ]]. <ref>''Progressive Christianity'' by William A. Vrooman 2005 ISBN 1417998296 page 150</ref><ref>''Christianity: the first two thousand years'' by David Lawrence Edwards 2001 ISBN 0304701270 pages 438-439</ref> . 

Groups of liberal Catholics view the traditional image of the Virgin Mary as presented by the Catholic Church as an obstacle towards realization of the goal of womanhood, and as a symbol of the systemic patriarchal oppression of women within the Church. Moreover, some liberal Catholics view the cultivation of the traditional image of Mary as a method of manipulation of Catholics at large by the Church hierarchy. <ref>''Hail Mary?: the struggle for ultimate womanhood in Catholicism'' by Maurice Hamington 1995 ISBN 0415913047 pages 2 and 36</ref> Other liberal Christians argue that the modern concepts of equal opportunity for men and women does not resonate well with the humble image of Mary, obediently and subserviently kneeling before Christ. <ref>''Blessed one: Protestant perspectives on Mary'' by Beverly Roberts Gaventa, Cynthia L.

==Virginity==. 
[[Image:Mother of God -Znameniye.jpg|right|200px]] . 

Christian orthodoxy accepts the New Testament claim that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was a virgin at the time Jesus was conceived, based on the accounts in the gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]. The [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], and [[Oriental Orthodox]] [[Christian denomination|denomination]]s, additionally hold to the [[dogma]] of the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]].  . 

[[File:Virgo inter Virgines IMG 1383.JPG|thumb|''Virgo inter Virgines'' (The Blessed virgin Mary with other holy virgins),  anonymous, [[Bruges]], last quarter of the 15th Century.]]
The Catholic Encyclopedia says: "There are two elements in virginity: the material element, that is to say, the absence, in the past and in the present, of all complete and voluntary delectation, whether from [[lust]] or from the lawful use of marriage; and the formal element, that is the firm resolution to abstain forever from sexual pleasure." And, "Virginity is irreparably lost by sexual pleasure, voluntarily and completely experienced."<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15458a.htmThe Catholic Encyclopedia, 'Virginity']</ref> However, for the purposes of [[consecrated virgins]]it is canonically enough that they have never been married or lived in open violation of chastity.  . 

[[Thomas Aquinas]], emphasizing that acts other than copulation destroy virginity, but also clarifying that involuntary sexual pleasure or pollution does not destroy virginity says in his [[Summa Theologica]], "Pleasure resulting from resolution of semen may arise in two ways. If this be the result of the mind's purpose, it destroys virginity, ''whether copulation takes place or not''. Augustine, however, mentions copulation, because such like resolution is the ordinary and natural result thereof. On another way this may happen beside the purpose of the mind, either during sleep, or through violence and without the mind's consent, although the flesh derives pleasure from it, or again through weakness of nature, as in the case of those who are subject to a flow of semen. On such cases virginity is not forfeit, because such like pollution is not the result of impurity which excludes virginity."<ref>Aquinas. [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3152.htm Summa Theologica], Second Part of the Second Part, Question 152. </ref> . 

Some female [[saint]]s and [[Beatification|blesseds]] are indicated by the church as ''[[Virgin (title)|Virgin]]''. These were consecrated virgins, nuns or unmarried women known for a  life in chastity. Being referred to as ''Virgin'' can especially mean being a member of the [[Ordo Virginum]] (Order of virgins), which applies to the consecrated virgins living in the world or in [[monastic order]]s.  . 

==Marriage==.

[[Image:Weyden Matrimony.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''"Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate."'' ([[Gospel of Matthew]] 19:6) Matrimony, ''[[Seven Sacraments Altarpiece|The Seven Sacraments]]'', [[Rogier van der Weyden]], ca. 1445.]] . 

[[Catholic Marriage]] is a "covenant by which a man and a woman establish between themselves a partnership of the whole of life and which is ordered by its nature to the good of the spouses and the procreation and education of offspring. [It] has been raised by Christ the Lord to the dignity of a sacrament between the baptised."<ref>{{cite web|title=CIC|quote=1055 §1|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3V.HTM}}</ref> In the [[Roman Rite]], it is ordinarily celebrated in a [[Holy Mass#Nuptial Mass and other Ritual Masses|Nuptial Mass]].  . 

The nature of the covenant requires that the two participants be one man and one woman, that they be free to marry, that they willingly and knowingly enter into a valid marriage contract, and that they validly execute the performance of the contract.  . 

===Divorce=== . 

{{main|Christian views of divorce#Roman Catholic Church}} . 

<!--Need some information on what marriage was like in the Roman Empire before Catholicism -->
Divorce in the ancient world left many women in dire economic and social straits{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. In the [[Roman Empire]], husbands were allowed to leave their wife, but wives were denied a reciprocal right. <ref name=witte20>Witte (1997), p. 20. </ref><ref name=witte25>Witte (1997), p. 25. </ref> Early [[Church Fathers]] pointed to the [[Gospel of Mark]], which describes Jesus labelling men or women who divorced and remarried as adulterers. [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] wrote vehemently against the practice of punishing women who committed adultery while overlooking the same acts by men.  . 

Married women were attracted to the Christian ideal that men and women shared the same obligatory moral code.  Women often converted first and introduced the religion to their social network; it was in this way that the religion often spread to the upper classes of society. <ref name=Chadwick58and59>Chadwick (1990), pp. 58&ndash;59. </ref> . 

As the Church gained greater influence in European society, its teachings were occasionally codified into law.  Church teaching heavily influenced the legal concept of marriage. <ref name=power1and2>Power (1995), pp. 1&ndash;2. </ref> During the [[Gregorian Reform]] of the 11th century, the Church developed and codified a view of marriage as a sacrament. <ref name=witte23>Witte Jr., John (1997). From Sacrament to Contract: Marriage, Religion, and Law in the Western Tradition. Westminster John Knox Press. p. 23. ISBN 0664255434</ref>  In a departure from societal norms, Church law required the consent of both parties before a marriage could be performed<ref name=witte20/> and established a minimum age for marriage. <ref name=shahar33>Shahar (2003), p. 33. </ref> The elevation of marriage to a sacrament also made the union a binding contract, with dissolutions overseen by Church authorities. <ref name=witte29>Witte (1997), p. 29. </ref><ref name=witte36>Witte (1997), p. 36. </ref> Under [[canon law]], spouses could be granted a "divorce a mensa et thoro" ("divorce from bed-and-board").  The husband and wife physically separated and were forbidden to live or [[cohabit]] together; but their marital relationship did not fully terminate. <ref>Kent's Commentaries on American Law, p. 125, n. 1 (14th ed. 1896). </ref>  Alternatively, Church laws permitted spouses to petition for an [[Annulment (Catholic Church)|annulment]] with proof that essential conditions for contracting a valid marriage were absent.  [[Ecclesiastical courts]] would grant a "divorce a vinculo matrimonii", or "divorce from all the bonds of marriage",&ndash;essentially ruling that the marriage had never taken place&ndash;when presented evidence that the marriage had been invalid from its start. <ref>W.

Over time, Church interpretation of a woman's role in marriage has changed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}<!-- needs to be well-sourced; pretty sure this is true but currently is complete OR --> Church teachings have always affirmed that wives should be "subordinate" to their husbands.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  This is rooted in several Biblical passages, such as "Let wives also be subject in everything to their husbands" (Eph. 5:24).  In modern times, this teaching has been the subject of much controversy, with many scholars decrying the perceived discrimination against women.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} <!-- is the preceeding comment accurate? -->  In <year>, Pope [[John Paul II]] clarified that "subordinate" should be defined as a " "mutual subjection out of reverence for Christ" {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} <!-- (Mulieris Dignitatem 24; cf. Eph. 5:21) need secondary source --> and asserted that "the matrimonial union requires respect for and perfection of the true personal subjectivity of both of them. The woman cannot be made the object of dominion and male possession (MD 10)."{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} . 

<!--  Not sure how this is relevant in terms of Church teaching.  Hiding until more information or at least some pretty good sourcing . 

That husband and wife are to be subject to one another is reinforced in the next verse of the original passage cited: "Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the Church and gave himself up for her" (Eph. 5:25). This injunction transforms the potentially selfish orientation of male love into a form of intense self-sacrificial service. Subordination is mutual, but the admonition is given to husbands, perhaps because they need it more. What is implied, then, is not general female inferiority but general female superiority in the order that most matters eschatologically—the order of charity.  .

==Reproductive issues==. 
===Contraception===. 
{{Main|Christian views on contraception#Roman Catholic Church}} . 

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] is morally opposed to contraception and orgasmic acts outside of the context of marital intercourse.  This belief dates back to the first centuries of Christianity. <ref>http://www.catholic.com/library/Contraception_and_Sterilization.asp</ref>  Such acts are considered illicit [[mortal sins]], with the belief that all licit sexual acts must be open to [[procreation]].  . 

The [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s precipitated [[Pope Paul VI]]'s 1968 encyclical ''[[Humanae Vitae]] (On Human Life)'' which rejected the use of [[Birth control|contraception]], including [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]], claiming these work against the intimate relationship and moral order of husband and wife by directly opposing God's will. <ref name="humanae"/> It approved [[Natural Family Planning]] as a legitimate means to limit family size. <ref name="humanae">{{cite web|last=Paul VI|first=Pope|title=Humanae Vitae|publisher=Vatican|year=1968|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html|accessdate=2 February 2008}}</ref> . 

The only form of birth control permitted is abstinence. Modern scientific methods of "periodic abstinence" such as [[Natural Family Planning|Natural Family Planning (NFP)]] were counted as a form of abstinence by [[Pope Paul VI]] in his 1968 encyclical ''[[Humanae Vitae]]''. <ref name="pope1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html|title=Humanae Vitae: Encyclical of Pope Paul VI on the Regulation of Birth, July 25, 1968|accessdate=2006-10-01|publisher=The Vatican}}</ref> The following is the condemnation of contraception:
<blockquote>Therefore We base Our words on the first principles of a human and Christian doctrine of marriage when We are obliged once more to declare that the direct interruption of the generative process already begun and, above all, all direct abortion, even for therapeutic reasons, are to be absolutely excluded as lawful means of regulating the number of children. Equally to be condemned, as the magisterium of the Church has affirmed on many occasions, is direct sterilization, whether of the man or of the woman, whether permanent or temporary.  . 

Similarly excluded is any action which either before, at the moment of, or after sexual intercourse, is specifically intended to prevent procreation—whether as an end or as a means. </blockquote> . 

The Church's rejection of the use of [[condom]]s has provoked criticism, especially with respect to countries where the incidence of [[AIDS]] and [[HIV]] has reached epidemic proportions. The Church maintains that in countries like Kenya and Uganda, where behavioral changes are encouraged alongside condom use, greater progress in controlling the disease has been made than in those countries solely promoting condoms. <ref>{{cite web|last=Dugger|first=Carol|title=Why is Kenya's AIDS rate plummeting?|work=International Herald Tribune|date=18 May 2006|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/05/18/news/aids.php|accessdate=21 February 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Brenda|title=Study: Verbal Warnings Helped Curb AIDS in Uganda|publisher=National Public Radio|date=4 May 2004|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1869907|accessdate=15 August 2008}}</ref> . 

A number of other documents provide more insight into the Church's position on contraception. The commission appointed to study the question in the years leading up to ''Humanae Vitae'' issued two reports, a majority report explaining why the Church could change its teaching on contraception, and a minority report which explains the reasons for upholding the traditional Christian view on contraception. <ref>[http://www.endowonline.metadot.net/resources/classes/humanae-vitae/minority-papal-commission-report Minority Report]</ref> In 1997, the Vatican released a document entitled "Vademecum for Confessors" (2:4) which states "[t]he Church has always taught the intrinsic evil of contraception."<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/family/documents/rc_pc_family_doc_12021997_vademecum_en.html  Vademecum]</ref> Furthermore, many [[Church Fathers]] condemned the use of contraception. <ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/ANSWERS/FKBCONTR.HTM This Rock Magazine: The Fathers Know Best]</ref><ref>[http://www.therealpresence.org/archives/Abortion_Euthanasia/Abortion_Euthanasia_004.htm Fr. Haydon]</ref> . 

The 1987 document [[Donum Vitae]] opposes [[in-vitro fertilization]] on grounds that it is harmful to embryos. Later on, the 2008 instruction [[Dignitas Personae]] denounces embryonic manipulations and new methods of contraception.  . 

Some Catholics have voiced significant disagreement with the Church's stance on contraception. <ref>A summary and restatement of the debate is available in Roderick Hindery. "The Evolution of Freedom as Catholicity in Catholic Ethics." ''Anxiety, Guilt, and Freedom''. Eds. Benjamin Hubbard and Brad Starr, UPA, 1990. </ref> The [[Winnipeg Statement]] of the Canadian Bishops was widely seen as a dissenting document for recognizing that many Catholics find it "either extremely difficult or even impossible to make their own all elements of this doctrine" and  reasserting the Catholic principle of [[Conscience#Conscience in Catholic theology|primacy of conscience]],<ref name="winnipeg">{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholic-legate.com/articles/winnipeg.html|title=Canadian Bishops' Statement on the Encyclical "Humanae Vitae"|accessdate=2006-10-02}}</ref> a position that they said should be properly interpreted, since they insisted that "a Catholic Christian is not free to form his conscience without consideration of the teaching of the ''magisterium'', in the particular instance exercised by the Holy Father in an encyclical letter". <ref>[http://grigaitis.net/weekly/2008/plenary1969-04-18.html Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops Plenary Assembly, 18 April 1969, ''Statement on Family Life and Related Matters'']</ref> Theologians such as [[Charles Curran (theologian)|Charles Curran]] have also criticized the stance of ''Humanae Vitae'' on artificial birth control.

In 2010, in "Light of the World: The Pope, the Church and the Signs of the Times", a book-length interview by German journalist [[Peter Seewald]], Pope [[Benedict XVI]] said that while the church did not consider condoms as a "real or moral solution", there were times where the "intention of reducing the risk of infection" made condom use "a first step" towards a better way. <ref>[http://www.sydney.catholic.org.au/news/features/2010/20101124_115.shtml Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney – Features].

===Abortion===. 
{{main|Catholic Church and abortion}} . 

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] opposes all forms of [[abortion]] procedures whose intended and primary purpose is to destroy an embryo, blastocyst, zygote or fetus. Catholics who support this position say that it is based on a belief in the equality of all human life, and that human life begins at conception. 'Indirect abortion,' by which Catholic jurists mean a particular procedure in the case of ectopic pregnancy where the death of the fetus is said to be a secondary effect of the procedure, may be permissible. Catholics who procure abortion are considered to be automatically excommunicated, as per [[Canon 1398]] of the Latin Rite [[Code of Canon Law]] or Canon 1450 §2 of the [[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]].  . 

The [[Catholic Church]] regards abortion as a 'moral evil'. <ref>Catechism of the Catholic Church 2271. </ref>  [[Abortion]] was condemned by the Church as early as the first century, again in the fourteenth century and again in 1995 with Pope John Paul II's encyclical ''[[Evangelium Vitae]] (Gospel of Life)''. <ref name="Bokenkotter493">Bokenkotter, p. 27, p. 154, pp. 493–494. </ref> This encyclical condemned the "[[culture of death]]" which the pope often used to describe the societal embrace of [[Birth control|contraception]], [[abortion]], [[euthanasia]], [[suicide]], [[capital punishment]], and [[genocide]]. <ref name="Bokenkotter493"/><ref>{{cite web|title=The Death Penalty Pro and Con: The Pope's Statement|publisher=PBS|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/angel/procon/popestate.html|accessdate=12 June 2008}}</ref> .

===Religious vocations===.

[[File:Sisters of Charity.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mother Teresa]]'s [[Missionaries of Charity]] wearing traditional Indian [[sari]]s.]] . 

In the [[Catholic Church]], a nun is a woman who has taken [[solemn vow]]s (the male equivalent is often called a "[[monk]]" or "friar", although the positions actually entail very different religious origins and constitute very different duties of the church {{cite}}). The only distinction between a nun and a sister is that nuns have solemn vows and sisters have simple vows. Nuns are usually cloistered or enclosed to the degree established by the [[monastic rule|rule]] of the religious institution they enter;<ref>" Monasteries of nuns which are ordered entirely to [[contemplation|contemplative life]]almost always observe  papal cloister, that is, cloister according to the norms given by the [[Apostolic See]]. Other monasteries of nuns are to observe a cloister adapted to their proper character and defined in the constitutions."[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P28.HTM Canon 667] §3, CIC 1983</ref> exceptions include one branch of [[Visitandines]] and the [[Ursulines]].  . 

In the Roman Catholic tradition, there are a number of different [[religious order|orders]] of nuns each with its own [[charism]] or special character. Some have ancient origins, as with  [[Benedictine]] sisters, whose monastic way of life developed from the 6th Century [[Rule of Saint Benedict]]. St. Benedict is considered the father of [[Western Monasticism]] and his sister, [[Saint Scholastica]] is the [[patron saint]] of nuns. <ref>http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-scholastica/</ref> During the [[Middle Ages]], monastic settlements were established throughout western Europe and convents and abbeys for women could become powerful institutions. St. Dominic founded the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] movement in France in the 12th century and Dominican nuns have gathered in contemplative religious communities ever since. <ref>http://curia.op.org/en/index.php/eng/about-us/nuns</ref> Dominican sisters, looking to  [[Saint Catherine of Siena]] for inspiration, also live in religious community but have more independence and work in ministries such as education and care of the sick. <ref>http://curia.op.org/en/index.php/eng/about-us/sisters</ref>  . 

In keeping with the emphasis of Catholic social teaching, many religious orders for women have subsequently been developed for service of the sick, homeless, disabled, orphaned, aged or mentally ill, as well as refugees, prisoners and others facing misfortune. Education of the young has also been a major ministry for Catholic women in religious orders. The Englishwoman [[Mary Ward]] founded the  Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary (Loreto Sisters) in 1609, and the order has established schools throughout the world. Irishwoman [[Catherine McAuley]] founded the [[Sisters of Mercy]] in Dublin in 1831, at a time where access to education had been the preserve of Ireland's Protestant Ascendency. The order went on to found schools and hospitals across the globe. <ref>http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10199a.htm</ref> St. [[Jeanne Jugan]] founded the [[Little Sisters of the Poor]] on the [[Rule of Saint Augustine]] to assist the impoverished elderly of the streets of France in the mid-nineteenth century. Her order too spread around the world. <ref>http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Little_Sisters_of_the_Poor</ref> In the New World too, religious orders were established for women: Saint [[Katharine Drexel]] inherited a fortune and established the [[Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament|Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament
 for Indians and Colored People]] (now known as the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament), founded schools across America and started [[Xavier University of Louisiana]] in New Orleans in 1925 for the education of African Americans. <ref>http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2000-04-02/news/0004120436_1_katharine-drexel-mother-katharine-blessed-sacrament</ref> In Britain's [[Australia|Australian colonies]] in 1866, Saint [[Mary McKillop]] co-founded the [[Sisters of St. Joseph of the Sacred Heart]] who began educating the rural poor and grew to establish schools and hospices throughout Oceania. <ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/mackillop-mary-helen-4112</ref> In the United States, the [[Sisters of St. Mary]] was founded in 1872 by Mother [[Mary Odilia Berger]]. The sisters went on to establish a large network of hospitals across America. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/us/21nuns.html?_r=3&pagewanted=2&smid=fb-nytimes | work=The New York Times | first=Kevin | last=Sack | title=Nuns, a ‘Dying Breed,' Fade From Leadership Roles at Catholic Hospitals | date=20 August 2011}}</ref> Many other religious orders for women have been established down through the centuries, right up to modern times - though in the West, their work in education and medical care is increasingly being taken up by laypeople.  . 

While religious vocations have generally been in decline in the West since the 1970s, vocations remain strong in the developing world. The famous [[Mother Teresa]] of Calcutta established the [[Missionaries of Charity]] in the slums of Calcutta in 1948 to work among "the poorest of the poor". Initially founding a school, she then gathered other sisters who "rescued new-born babies abandoned on rubbish heaps; they sought out the sick; they took in lepers, the unemployed, and the mentally ill". Teresa achieved fame in the 1960s and began to establish convents around the world. By the time of her death in 1997, the order had more than 450 centres in over 100 countries. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/5872071/Mother-Teresa.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Mother Teresa | date=6 September 1997}}</ref> . 

===Ordination of women===. 
{{main|Catholic Church doctrine on the ordination of women}} . 

[[Feminists]] have disagreed with Church teachings on the [[ordination of women]] and have worked together with a coalition of American nuns to lead the Church to reconsider its position. <ref name="Bokenkotter465">Bokenkotter, pp. 465–466. </ref> They stated that many of the major Church documents were supposedly full of anti-female prejudice and a number of studies were conducted to discover how this alleged prejudice developed when it was deemed contrary to the openness of Jesus. <ref name="Bokenkotter465"/> These events led Pope John Paul II to issue the 1988 encyclical''[[Mulieris Dignitatem]] (On the Dignity of Women)'', which declared that women had a different, yet equally important role in the Church. <ref>{{cite web|last=John Paul II|first=Pope|title=Mulieris Dignitatem|publisher=Vatican|year=1988|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_15081988_mulieris-dignitatem_en.html|accessdate=21 February 2008}}</ref><ref name="Bokenkotter467">Bokenkotter, p. 467. </ref> . 

The Catholic Church doctrine on the ordination of women, as expressed in the current [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] and the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], is that: "Only a baptized man (In Latin, ''vir'') validly receives sacred ordination."<ref>''Codex Iruis Canonici'' canon 1024, c.f. ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' 1577</ref> Insofar as priestly and episcopal ordination are concerned, the Church teaches that this requirement is a matter of divine law, and thus doctrinal. <ref>"The Catholic Church has never felt that priestly or episcopal ordination can be validly conferred on women," ''Inter Insigniores,'' October 15, 1976, section 1</ref> The requirement that only males can receive ordination to the diaconate has not been promulgated as doctrinal by the Church's magisterium, though it is clearly at least a requirement according to canon law. <ref>''Canonical Implications of Ordaining Women to the Permanent Diaconate,'' Canon Law Society of America, 1995. </ref><ref>Commentary by the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith on the Declaration ''Inter Insigniores.''</ref> . 

The reservation of priestly ordination to men is perhaps the sorest spot among contemporary critics of the Catholic Church’s treatment of women. <ref>{{cite book |title=A Concise History of the Catholic Church |first=Thomas |last=Bokenkotter |publisher=Random House Digital, Inc. |year=2005 |page=487 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DISK1e7JXA8C&pg=PA487&dq=%22Catholic+Church%22+women&hl=en&ei=o4cGTq7FCYLAsAOGxajUDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&q=%22Catholic%20Church%22%20women&f=false}}</ref>  Several Protestant religious traditions have authorized women ministers and preachers. Many churches in the Anglican Communion already permit women to serve at the altar. The 23 ''[[sui iuris]]'' Catholic Churches and the Eastern Orthodox are committed to an exclusively male priesthood, and these churches comprise three-fourths of all Christians in the world.  . 

In 1976, the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith discussed the issue of the ordination of women and issued a ''[[Inter Insigniores|Declaration on the Question of the Admission of Women to the Ministerial Priesthood]]'' which concluded that for various doctrinal, theological, and historical reasons, the Church "... does not consider herself authorized to admit women to priestly ordination". The most important reasons stated were first, the Church's determination to remain faithful to its constant tradition, second, its fidelity to Christ's will, and third, the idea of male representation due to the "sacramental nature" of the priesthood. The Biblical Commission, an advisory commission that was to study the exclusion of women from the ministerial priesthood from a biblical perspective, had three opposing findings. They were, "that the New Testament does not settle in a clear way... whether women can be ordained as priests, [that] scriptural grounds alone are not enough to exclude the possibility of ordaining women, [and that] Christ's plan would not be transgressed by permitting the ordination of women."<ref>Pierre, Simone M. The Struggle to Serve: the Ordination of Women in the Roman Catholic Church. Jefferson: McFarland and Company, Inc., 1994. </ref> In recent years, responding to questions about the matter, the Church has issued a number of documents repeating the same position. <ref>Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith: ''Inter Insigniores,'' October 15, 1976; Pope John Paul II: Apostolic Letter ''[[Ordinatio Sacerdotalis]]'', May 22, 1994; Pope John Paul II: Apostolic Letter ''[[Mulieris Dignitatem]],'' August 15, 1988. </ref> In 1994, [[Pope John Paul II]] declared the question closed in his letter ''[[Ordinatio Sacerdotalis]],'' stating: "Wherefore, in order that all doubt may be removed regarding a matter of great importance…I declare that the Church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the Church's faithful."<ref>John Paul II in ''Ordinatio Sacerdotalis,'' c.f. Apostolic Exhortation ''Christifideles Laici'' (30 December 1988), 31</ref> . 

Cardinal Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI) too has reiterated that the church teaching regarding women’s ordination is “founded on the written Word of God, and from the beginning constantly preserved and applied in the Tradition of the Church, it has been set forth infallibly by the ordinary and universal Magisterium.”
In 1994 the encyclical ''[[Ordinatio Sacerdotalis]] (On Ordination to the Priesthood)'' further explained that the Church follows the example of Jesus, who chose only men for the specific priestly duty. <ref>{{cite web|last=John Paul II|first=Pope|title=Ordinatio Sacerdotalis|publisher=Vatican|date=22 May 1994|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_22051994_ordinatio-sacerdotalis_en.html|accessdate=2 February 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Cowell|first=Alan|title=Pope Rules Out Debate On Making Women Priests|work=The New York Times|date=31 May 1994|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E7DE133BF932A05756C0A962958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|accessdate=12 February 2008}}</ref> .
