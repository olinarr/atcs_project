Issues surrounding the '''[[Catholic Church]] and [[AIDS]]''' have become controversial in the past twenty years, primarily because many prominent religious leaders have publicly declared their opposition to the use of [[condoms]] for [[Christian views on contraception#Roman Catholicism|contraception]] or disease prevention. Many health workers and even some religious figures feel they are currently the only means to stop the epidemic. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Other issues involve religious participation in global health care services and collaboration with secular organizations such as [[UNAIDS]] and the [[World Health Organization]]. Catholic organisations like [[Caritas (charity)|Caritas]] already perform extensive social and educational work relating to AIDS, as for example the provision of services to 14,000 AIDS [[orphan]]s in [[Namibia]].[http://www.caritas.org/activities/hiv_aids/index.html] . 

==Background==. 
The [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s precipitated [[Pope Paul VI]]'s 1968 encyclical ''[[Humanae Vitae]] (On Human Life)'' which rejected the use of [[contraception]], including [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]], asserting that these work against the intimate relationship and moral order of husband and wife by directly opposing God's will. <ref name="humanae"/> It approved [[Natural family planning|Natural Family Planning]] as a legitimate means to limit family size. <ref name="humanae">{{cite web|last=Paul VI|first=Pope|title=Humanae Vitae|publisher=Vatican|year=1968|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html|accessdate=2 February 2008}}</ref> The assertion of Papal authority on this issue was an unusual departure from [[Conciliar]] authority which was the normal process of the [[Church Councils]] such as [[Vatican II]].  . 

==Church teaching on the use of condoms==. 
The use of condoms to prevent disease is a controversial issue, with Catholic theologians arguing both sides. <!--

While condoms might serve as an effective barrier to the transmission of HIV, condoms also impermissibly impede the procreative aspect of the sexual act which is understood by the Church to have [[Theology of the Body|a deeply theological meaning]].  As such, their use is forbidden.  Theology aside, Church officials deny that their teaching against condom use is followed by those same people who flout Church teaching on illicit sexual activity, such as its absolute condemnation of [[anal intercourse]] between men.  . 

A common position of Church leaders is that officially permitting condom use as a method of preventing disease could be interpreted as permitting fornication, which degrades and debases sex.  . 

==Condom controversy==. 
The Church emphasizes "[[Catholic teachings on sexual morality|education towards sexual responsibility]]", focusing on partner fidelity rather than the use of condoms as the primary means of preventing the transmission of AIDS. <ref name=CNS.AIDS>{{cite web |title=Pope's condom comments latest chapter in sensitive church discussion |first=John |last=Thavis |url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0901232.htm |date=2009-03-18 |accessdate=2010-02-21}}</ref>  The Church's position is that all responsible sex must occur within the framework of a faithful, monogamous relationship.  In addition, various members of the Church hierarchy have pointed out that condoms have a non-zero risk of transmitting AIDS.  . 

Church officials argue that reliance on condoms to prevent transmission of AIDS can result in a false sense of security because of the problem of "leakage and breakage". Other more serious claims have been made, however. In 2003, contrary to empirical evidence, the president of the Vatican's [[Pontifical Council for the Family]] - "senior spokesman" [[Cardinal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo]] - claimed that condoms are permeable to the aids virus. He explained to BBC interviewers that ''"The Aids virus is roughly 450 times smaller than the spermatozoon. The spermatozoon can easily pass through the 'net' that is formed by the condom."'' These false claims were echoed by an archbishop of Nairobi, as well as by Catholics as far Asia and Latin America. Also according to [[The Guardian]], the BBC confirmed that this misinformation has real, damaging effects at the ground level. <ref name="Vatican: condoms don't stop Aids"/> . 

The Church is concerned that promotion of condom use will lead to irresponsible, risky sexual behavior (promiscuity and prostitution).  Both individuals and governments could come to rely on condoms as the primary line of defense rather than emphasizing the need for "partner fidelity".  . 

===Pope John Paul II===. 
[[John Paul II]]'s position against artificial birth control, including the use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIV,<ref name="Condom">{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1979145,00.html|title=Catholic Church to Ease Ban on Condom Use|date=24 April 2006|publisher=© 2006, 2009 [http://www.dw-world.de/ Deutsche Welle]|accessdate=12 January 2009}}</ref> was harshly criticised by doctors and [[AIDS]] activists, who said that it led to countless deaths and millions of [[AIDS]] [[orphan]]s. <ref name="Condom2">{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-107517312.html|title=Top Catholics Question Condom Ban|date=16 April 2005|publisher=© 2005, 2009 [http://www.iht.com/ International Herald Tribune]|accessdate=12 January 2009}}</ref> Critics have also claimed that large families are caused by lack of contraception and exacerbate [[Third World]] poverty and problems such as [[street children]] in South America.  . 

On 15 November 1989, John Paul II addressed the 4th International Conference of the [[Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Health Care Workers]]<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/1989/november/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_19891115_pastorale-operatori-sanitari_it.html Discorso di Giovanni Paolo II al partecipanti alla Conferenza Internazionale promossa dal Pontifico Consiglo per la Pastorale degli Operatori Sanitari], Vatican website</ref> in the following terms : ''it seems profoundly damaging to the dignity of the human being, and for this reason morally illicit, to support a prevention of AIDS that is based on a recourse to means and remedies that violate an authentically human sense of sexuality, and which are a palliative to the deeper suffering which involve the responsibility of individuals and of society.''<ref name="Episcopal Conference of Madagascar">Episcopal Conference of Madagascar, "AIDS: Imminent Danger for Man Today, for the Family and Society", 14 may 1990, in "Speak Out on HIV & AIDS: Our prayer is always full of hope", by the Catholic Bishops of Africa and Madagascar, Paulines Publications Africa, Nairobi, 2004, p.32</ref> This was interpreted in May 1990 by the [[Roman Catholicism in Madagascar|Roman Catholic bishops of Madagascar]] as a "solemn reminder" giving ground for their view that in the context of positions such as that of [[Jean-Marie Lustiger|cardinal Lustiger]] who stated that it was a "lesser evil", "the condom remains a 'moral evil'". <ref name="Episcopal Conference of Madagascar"/> . 

In September 1990, John Paul II visited the small town of [[Mwanza]], in northern [[Tanzania]], and gave a speech that many believe set the tone for the AIDS crisis in Africa.  Being unequivocal, he told his audience that condoms were a sin in any circumstances. He lauded family values and praised fidelity and abstinence as the only true ways to combat the disease. <ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article5927923.ece John Paul’s 1990 speech ‘sentenced millions to die’]</ref> . 

In December 1995, the [[Pontifical Council for the Family]] issued guidelines saying that ''parents must also reject the promotion of so-called "safe sex" or "safer sex", a dangerous and immoral policy based on the deluded theory that the condom can provide adequate protection against AIDS''. <ref>Pontifical Council for the Family [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/family/documents/rc_pc_family_doc_08121995_human-sexuality_en.html The Truth and Meaning of Human Sexuality]</ref> . 

===Pope Benedict XVI=== . 

In 1988 a debate within the Catholic Church over the use of [[condom]]s to prevent [[AIDS]] sparked an intervention from Rome. The Church in 1968 had already stated in [[Humanae Vitae]] that chemical and barrier methods of contraception went against Church teachings. The debate was over the different issue of whether or not condoms could be used, not as contraceptives, but as a means of preventing the spread of [[HIV]]/AIDS and other [[sexually transmitted diseases]]. In 1987, the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|U. S. Conference of Catholic Bishops]] issued a document suggesting that education on the use of condoms could be an acceptable part of an anti-AIDS program.  . 

In response, Cardinal Ratzinger stated that such an approach "would result in at least the facilitation of evil" – not merely its toleration. For the full text of the letter, see: [[s:On "The Many Faces of AIDS"|On "The Many Faces of AIDS"]] (See also Karol Wojtyla's ''[[Love and Responsibility]]''). Critics argue that Ratzinger's approach would lead to increases in the frequency of HIV/AIDS infections, while many Catholics dispute this and emphasize the value of faithful relationships or [[chastity]], as it is scientifically impossible to contract the disorder without having sex with an infected person, unless via some other means such as a blood transfusion or sharing a needle.  . 

In 2005, the Pope listed several ways to combat the spread of HIV, including chastity, fidelity in marriage and anti-poverty efforts; he also rejected the use of condoms. <ref>BBC News. (2005) Pope rejects condoms for Africa. Retrieved from: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4081276.stm</ref> . 

In March 2009, the Pope was sharply criticized<ref>Butt, Riazat.  [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/17/pope-africa-condoms-aids "Pope claims condoms could make African Aids crisis worse."] ''[[The Guardian]]''.  17 March 2009.  17 March 2009. </ref> after he stated that “if there is no human dimension, if Africans do not help [by responsible behaviour], the problem cannot be overcome by the distribution of prophylactics: on the contrary, they increase it" and reiterated his view that "the solution must have two elements: firstly, bringing out the human dimension of sexuality, that is to say a spiritual and human renewal that would bring with it a new way of behaving towards others, and secondly, true friendship offered above all to those who are suffering, a willingness to make sacrifices and to practise self-denial, to be alongside the suffering.”<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2009/march/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20090317_africa-interview_en.html  Benedict XVI, Interview during his fight to Africa, 17 March 2009]</ref>  In that same month, a senior research scientist at the [[Harvard School of Public Health]], Mr. Edward C. Green, penned an article entitled "The Pope May Be Right" in which he stated that while "in theory, condom promotions ought to work everywhere...that's not what the research in Africa shows."  The writer also indicated that strategies that worked in Africa were "Strategies that break up these multiple and concurrent sexual networks -- or, in plain language, faithful mutual monogamy or at least reduction in numbers of partners, especially concurrent ones." <ref>[[Washington Post]]. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/27/AR2009032702825.html Green, Edw. C. "The Pope may be right."] 29 March
2009. </ref> . 

In 2010 comments the Pope made in an interview with journalist Peter Seewald regarding condom use attracted attention in the media. In the context of an extended discussion on the help the Church is giving AIDs victims and the need to fight the banalization of sexuality, and in response to the charge that "It is madness to forbid a high-risk population to use condoms", Pope Benedict stated: . 

{{cquote|There may be a basis in the case of some individuals, as perhaps when a male prostitute uses a condom, where this can be a first step in the direction of a moralization, a first assumption of responsibility, on the way toward recovering an awareness that not everything is allowed and that one cannot do whatever one wants.  But it is not really the way to deal with the evil of HIV infection. That can really lie only in a humanization of sexuality.  . 

She of course does not regard [the use of condoms] as a real or moral solution, but, in this or that case, there can be nonetheless, in the intention of reducing the risk of infection, a first step in a movement toward a different way, a more human way, of living sexuality. <ref>[http://www.catholicworldreport.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=220:pope-benedict-on-condoms-in-qlight-of-the-worldq&catid=53:cwr2010&Itemid=70]</ref>}}. 
This explanation was interpreted by many as a change of tact by the Vatican<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/nov/20/pope-benedict-catholic-church-condoms | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Ben | last=Quinn | title=Pope signals shift away from Catholic church's prohibition of condoms | date=20 November 2010}}</ref> which necessitated a clarification from the Vatican that "the pope does not morally justify the disordered exercise of sexuality, but maintains that the use of the condom to diminish the danger of infection may be “a first assumption of responsibility”, as opposed to not using the condom and exposing the other person to a fatal risk.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} . 

===Episcopal conferences=== . 

Despite the Vatican’s intransigence regarding the acceptability of condoms for the purpose of preventing transmission of the HIV/AIDS virus, a number of episcopal conferences have suggested that condom use may be acceptable in some circumstances to prevent AIDS. One of the first episcopal conferences to take such a stance was the French Bishops Council which asserted in 1989 that, “The whole population and especially the young should be informed of the risks. Prophylactic measures exist.” In 1996, the Social       Commission of the French Bishops' Conference said that condom use “can be understood in the case of people for whom sexual activity is an ingrained part of their lifestyle and for whom [that activity] represents a serious risk.”<ref>French Bishops Council, “AIDS: Society in Question,” 1996. </ref> In 1993, the German Bishops Conference noted: “In the final analysis,  human conscience constitutes the decisive authority in personal ethics... consideration must be given...to the spread of AIDS. It is a moral duty to prevent such suffering, even if the underlying behavior cannot be condoned in many cases...The church...has to respect responsible decision-making by couples.”<ref>German Bishops Conference, “Bevölkerungs-wachstum und Entwicklungsforderung (Population Policy and Development),” 1993. </ref> . 

==Dissent in the Church==. 
===Carlo Maria Martini===. 
In April 2006, in response to a very specific question from the bioethicist Ignazio Marino, Cardinal [[Carlo Maria Martini]] opined that in certain cases, the usage of [[condom]]s might be allowable stating, "The use of condoms can, in certain situations, be a lesser evil". <ref>Time Magazine, May 1, 2006. </ref> He stressed the particular case of married couples where one has [[HIV]] or [[AIDS]]. <ref>BBC. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4929962.stm Cardinal backs limited condom use] April 21, 2006</ref>  But he quickly noted that it's one thing the principle of the lesser evil in such cases, and quite another the subject who has to convey those things publicly, thus it is not up to the Church authorities to support condom use publicly, because of "the risk of promoting an irresponsible attitude". The Church is more likely to support other morally sustainable means, such as [[abstinence]]. <ref>L'Espresso. [http://www.chiesa.espressonline.it/dettaglio.jsp?id=51790&eng=y When Does Life Begin? Cardinal Martini Replies] May 20, 2006</ref> . 

===Godfried Danneels===. 
Cardinal Godfried Danneels is seen as one of the leaders of the "reformist party" within the Church. For instance, he has said that, although [[abstinence]] is preferable, [[condom]]s are acceptable as a means of preventing [[AIDS]]. In an interview with the Dutch Catholic broadcaster RKK, he said: "When someone is [[HIV]] positive and his partner says 'I want to have sexual relations with you', he doesn't have to do that, if you ask me. But, when he does, he has to use a condom, because otherwise he adds to a sin against the sixth commandment (thou shalt not commit adultery) a sin against the fifth (thou shalt not kill)." He added: "This comes down to protecting yourself in a preventive manner against a disease or death. It cannot be entirely morally judged in the same manner as a pure method of [[birth control]]." . 

===Jean-Marie Lustiger===. 
Although he fully endorsed John Paul II's views on [[bioethics]], Cardinal [[Jean-Marie Lustiger]] considered the use of condoms to be acceptable if one of the partners had [[HIV]]. <ref>TERRAS, Christian. Revue Golias, online publication</ref> . 

===Kevin Dowling===. 
Bishop [[Kevin Dowling]] believes that the Catholic Church should reverse its position on the use of condoms to prevent [[HIV]] transmission. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/europe/hero2005/dowling.html|title=European Heroes 2005: Lives in the Balance |first=Megan|last=Lindow |publisher=Time |year=2005|accessdate=2007-04-23}}</ref> . 

Dowling first announced his position on condom use in 2001, in a response to a question by a Catholic news agency reporter during a bishops' conference in southern Africa. After stating that the bishop's conference had not taken a position on condom use, Dowling was asked for his personal opinion, and said that he believed condoms should be used to prevent the spread of HIV.  . 

Following this, he received a number of rebukes from the South African [[papal nuncio]]. The bishop's conference condemned his words, describing condoms as "an immoral and misguided weapon" in the fight against HIV, and argued that condom use could even encourage the spread of HIV by promoting extramarital sex. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070407.wcondom0407/BNStory/International/home|title=South African bishop defies Vatican on condoms|first=Stephanie|last=Nolen|publisher=Globe and Mail|date=7 April 2007|accessdate=2007-04-23}}</ref> . 

===Catholics for Choice===. 
[[Catholics for Choice]], a dissident group, maintains that condom use will prevent the spread of AIDS, since couples will have sex despite Vatican prohibition. <ref name="Reformers Turn Up Heat on Church">[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,1564,1683801,00.html Reformers Turn Up Heat on Church]</ref> Two bishops share the beliefs of Condoms4Life,<ref>[http://www.aegis.com/news/ads/1996/AD960271.html French Bishop Supports Some Use of Condoms to Prevent AIDS]</ref><ref>[http://www.religiousconsultation.org/newsletters/January_2002/South%20African%20Bishop%20Supports%20Condoms%20to%20Prevent%20AIDS.htm One South African Bishop Supports Condoms To Prevent AIDS]</ref> and have come out in support of condom use when one partner has AIDS, arguing the Roman Catholic Church's official position on this issue is unconscionable. <ref name="Reformers Turn Up Heat on Church"/> . 

==Criticism==. 
[[File:El liston rojo no basta.jpg|thumb|right|180px|An aids-awareness poster of a condom in the shape of the aids ribbon; it reads "The red ribbon is not enough". Expert consensus is both that [[Condom#In preventing STDs|condoms are a powerful way to prevent STD transmission]], and that [[abstinence-only sex education]] is ineffective.]]

[[Polly Toynbee]] has characterized the Vatican as "a modern, potent force for cruelty and hypocrisy", charging that the Church's ban on condoms has "caused the death of millions of Catholics and others in areas dominated by Catholic missionaries, in Africa and right across the world. In countries where 50% are infected, millions of very young AIDS orphans are today's immediate victims of the curia."  . 

===NGOs=== . 

UNAIDS has collaborated with the Roman Catholic Church, especially [[Caritas Internationalis]], in the fight against AIDS, something which many people only realised after a December 2005 message by Pope Benedict XVI. <ref name="Partnerships in civil society"/> However, it indicated in a 2009 communiqué that it did not agree that condoms were unhelpful in AIDS prevention. <ref>[http://www.la-croix.com/afp.static/pages/090318173648.eqy3xtlg.htm La Croix article]</ref> . 

In 2003, the WHO denounced statements by the [[Roman Curia]]'s health department, saying: "These incorrect statements about condoms and HIV are dangerous when we are facing a global pandemic which has already killed more than 20 million people, and currently affects at least 42 million." <ref name="Vatican: condoms don't stop Aids"/> . 

===ACT UP activism===. 
There was a widespread belief among the [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power|ACT UP]] members that [[John Joseph O'Connor|O'Connor]] constituted a menace to people with AIDS. Michael Petrelis, a founding member of ACT UP, was arrested along with 110 others.  "We will not be silent,", he screamed before his arrest. "We will fight O'Connor's bigotry". <ref>{{cite news |first= Jason|last= Deparle|authorlink= |coauthors= |title= 111 Held in St. Patrick's AIDS Protest |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7DB1030F932A25751C1A96F948260&n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FPeople%2FK%2FKoch%2C%20Edward%20I.&scp=5&sq=O'Connor%20Act-Up&st=cse|work= The New York Times|publisher= |date= 11 December 1989|accessdate=1 January 2009 }}. </ref> Later, he indicated that the group "came to St. Patrick's in 1989 to repel the church's destructive intrusion into public policies concerning AIDS, gay civil rights and women's reproductive rights." <ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.actupny.org/YELL/stopchurch99.html|title= Stop the Church|accessdate=1 January 2009 |work= |publisher= ACT UP|date=}}</ref><ref name = activist2>{{cite book |title= The Activist's Handbook |last= Shaw|first= Randy|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2001|publisher= University of California |location= |isbn= 978-0520229280 |page= |pages= 222–4|url= |quote=The Cardinal O'Connor action requires more careful scrutiny.

"  Because of the media coverage, "the action came to be perceived as an attack on a religious ceremony rather than on a political advocate. " Factors in ACT UP's decision to proceed with the demonstration despite knowing that the media would side with O'Connor took into account "his vocal opposition to any education about safe sex, AIDS, or condoms in schools," which "increased public health risks.  .
