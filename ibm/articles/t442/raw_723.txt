'''Abstinence-only sex education''' is a form of [[sex education]] that teaches [[abstinence]] from [[Human sexual behavior|sex]], and often excludes many other types of [[sexual and reproductive health]] education, particularly regarding [[birth control]] and [[safe sex]]. This type of sex education promotes [[sexual abstinence]] until [[marriage]] and avoids discussion of use of [[contraceptives]]. [[Comprehensive sex education]], by contrast, covers the use of contraceptives as well as abstinence.  . 

Evidence does not support the use of abstinence only sex education. <ref name=Obs07>{{cite journal|last=Ott|first=MA|coauthors=Santelli, JS|title=Abstinence and abstinence-only education|journal=Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology|date=2007 Oct|volume=19|issue=5|pages=446–52|pmid=17885460|doi=10.1097/GCO.0b013e3282efdc0b}}</ref> It has been found to be ineffective in decreasing [[HIV]] risk in the developed world,<ref name="Underhill2007">{{cite journal|last=Underhill|first=K|coauthors=Operario, D, Montgomery, P|title=Abstinence-only programs for HIV infection prevention in high-income countries|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2007 Oct 17|issue=4|pages=CD005421|pmid=17943855|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005421.pub2|editor1-last=Operario|editor1-first=Don}}</ref> and does not decrease rates of unplanned [[pregnancy]]. <ref name="Obs07"/> . 

The topic is controversial, with proponents of abstinence-only education arguing that [[comprehensive sex education]] encourages premarital sexual activity and critics arguing that abstinence-only education is ineffective and that abstinence-only education is motivated by religious teachings, which have no place in the classroom.  . 

==Description==. 
Abstinence-only sex education teaches children to abstain from sex as the sole method of avoiding pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. In the U.S., States may apply for federal funding of abstinence-only sex education programs. To be eligible for funding programs must satisfy requirements given under the Social Security Act:<ref>[http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title05/0510.htm Social Security Act, Section 510]</ref>
<blockquote>
(2) For purposes of this section, the term "abstinence education" means an educational or motivational program which—
:(A) has as its exclusive purpose, teaching the social, psychological, and health gains to be realized by abstaining from sexual activity;
:(B) teaches abstinence from sexual activity outside marriage as the expected standard for all school age children;
:(C) teaches that abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and other associated health problems;
:(D) teaches that a mutually faithful monogamous relationship in context of marriage is the expected standard of human sexual activity;
:(E) teaches that sexual activity outside of the context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects;
:(F) teaches that bearing children out-of-wedlock is likely to have harmful consequences for the child, the child’s parents, and society;
:(G) teaches young people how to reject sexual advances and how alcohol and drug use increases vulnerability to sexual advances; and
:(H) teaches the importance of attaining self-sufficiency before engaging in sexual activity. 
</blockquote> . 

==Discussion==. 
Proponents of [[abstinence]]-only sex education argue that this approach is superior to comprehensive [[sex education]] because it emphasizes the teaching of morality that limits sex to that within the bounds of marriage, and that [[premarital sex|sex before marriage]] and at a [[Child sexuality|young age]] has heavy physical and emotional costs. <ref>PBS, February 4, 2005 [http://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week823/feature.html Religion & Ethics Newsweekly, Episode 823] Retrieved on 2007-14-03</ref> They suggest that comprehensive sex education encourages premarital sexual activity among teenagers, which should be discouraged in an era when [[HIV]] and other incurable [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infection]]s are widespread and when [[teen pregnancy]] is an ongoing concern.  . 

Opponents and critics, which include prominent professional associations in the fields of medicine, public health, adolescent health, and psychology, argue that such programs fail to provide adequate information to protect the health of [[adolescents]]. Some critics also argue that such programs verge on religious interference in secular education. Opponents of abstinence-only education dispute the claim that comprehensive sex education encourages teens to have premarital sex. <ref name="Kirby">Douglas Kirby, Ph.

==Effectiveness==. 
Evidence has not supported the effective use of abstinence-only sex education. <ref name="Obs07" /> It has  been found to be ineffective in decreasing [[HIV]] risk in the developed world,<ref name="Underhill2007" /> and does not decrease rates of unplanned [[pregnancy]]. <ref name="Obs07"/> . 

According to [[SIECUS]], the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, an organization that promotes comprehensive sex education<ref>[http://www.siecus.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.viewPage&pageId=514&parentID=477 SIECUS - Comprehensive Sexuality Education]</ref> in the United States,<ref>http://www.thebody.com/content/art2406.html</ref> a "...study, conducted by Mathematica Policy Research Inc. on behalf of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, found that abstinence-only-until-marriage programs are ineffective."<ref>[http://www.siecus.org/_data/global/images/research_says.pdf SIECUS Fact Sheet] (includes research citations). </ref>  In 2007, the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy published an overview of policy and research on "programs designed to prevent teen pregnancy and STD/HIV" titled ''Emerging Answers 2007''. <ref name="Kirby2007">{{cite web|author=Kirby, D.|title=Emerging Answers 2007: Research Findings on Programs to Reduce Teen Pregnancy and Sexually Transmitted Diseases
|publisher=National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy|year=2007|url=http://www.thenationalcampaign.org/ea2007/}} [http://www.thenationalcampaign.org/ea2007/ Homepage of the study.]</ref>  The report included a comprehensive [[metastudy]] examining research on the efficacy of abstinence-only as well as comprehensive sex education.  Despite "[t]wo less rigorous studies suggest[ing] that abstinence programs may have some positive effects on sexual behavior", ''Emerging Answers'' concluded that "studies of abstinence programs have not produced sufficient evidence to justify their widespread dissemination."  In contrast, the report judged the evidence for comprehensive sex education favorably, finding it effective for a wide range of students.  . 

A federally-funded [[University of Pennsylvania]] study published in the ''[[Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine]]'' found that only one third of sixth- and seventh-graders who completed abstinence-focused programs had sex within the next two years, compared to nearly half of the students who attended other classes, including ones that taught combined abstinence and contraception. <ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/164/2/152?home|title=Efficacy of a Theory-Based Abstinence-Only Intervention Over 24 Months|pmid=20124144|doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2009.267|year=2010|last1=Jemmott Jb|first1=3rd|last2=Jemmott|first2=LS|last3=Fong|first3=GT|volume=164|issue=2|pages=152–9|journal=Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine}}</ref> Critics pointed out that the abstinence program used in the study was not representative of most abstinence programs; it did not take a [[moralistic]] tone, encouraged children to delay sex until ready instead of until married, did not portray [[extramarital sex]] as inappropriate, and did not disparage [[contraceptives]]. The sample groups were also exclusively African-American and therefore not demographically representative of the entire population. <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/01/AR2010020102628.html|title=Abstinence-only programs might work, study says|last=Stein|first=Rob|date=February 2, 2010 | work=The Washington Post}}</ref> . 

A 2010 report by the [[Guttmacher Institute]] pointed out that pregnancy rates for teens 15-19 reversed their decline in 2006, near the peak of the Abstinence Only campaign in the United States. <ref>Table 1.0,“U.S. Teenage Pregnancies, Births and Abortions: National and State Trends and Trends by Race and Ethnicity." http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/2010/01/26/index.html, downloaded 20100127. </ref> Sarah Kliff of ''[[Newsweek]]'' pointed out that there was no corresponding "indication of an uptick" in teen pregnancy rates when abstinence-only sex education funding was increased during the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton years]], but in fact a small decline. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/thegaggle/archive/2010/01/27/why-bush-s-abstinence-only-policies-are-probably-not-to-blame-for-teen-pregnancy-increase.aspx|title=Why Bush's Abstinence-Only Policies Are (Probably) Not to Blame for the Teen-Pregnancy Increase|work=Newsweek|date=January 27, 2010}}</ref> James Wagoner, president of the nonprofit group [[Advocates for Youth]], blames the poor quality of  [[Presidency of George W.
