'''Criticism of the Catholic Church''' includes critical observations made about the current or historical [[Catholic Church]], in its actions, teachings, omissions, structure, or nature; theological disagreements would be covered on a [[Christian denomination|denominational]] basis. Criticisms may regard the concepts of [[pope|papal]] [[primacy of the Roman pontiff|primacy]] and [[papal supremacy|supremacy]], or aspects of church structure, governance, and particular practices. Since the Catholic Church is the largest Christian church representing over half of all Christians<ref name='Britannica'>{{cite book | author= Marty, Martin E., Chadwick, Henry, Pelikan, Jaroslav Jan |title="Christianity" in the Encyclopædia Britannica Millennium Edition |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |year=2000|quote=The Roman Catholics in the world outnumber all other Christians combined. }}</ref> and one sixth of the world's population,<ref name="Zenit">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Number of Catholics and Priests Rises | work = | publisher =Zenit News Agency | date =2007-02-12 | url =http://www.zenit.org/article-18894?l=english | doi = | accessdate =2008-02-21 }}</ref> these criticisms may not necessarily represent the majority view of all Christian and secular believers{{Clarify|date=October 2011|isn't "secular believers" an oxymoron? Anyway this sounds weasel-y}}.  . 

Criticism of the Catholic Church in previous centuries was more closely related to [[theology|theological]] and ecclesiological disputes. The [[Protestant Reformation]] (16th century in Europe) came about in no small part due to abuses of church practices by corrupt clergy in addition to these same theological disputes. <ref name="Multiple Authors 2003 11,93, 106, 112, 174, 140, 141">{{cite book |last= Multiple Authors|title=Medieval Times to Today |origyear=2003|publisher= Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-062995-2 |pages= 11, 93, 106, 112, 174, 140, 141 |chapter=One |year= 2003}}</ref> . 

Political disputes compounded the theological grievances between Protestants and Catholics and to this day the debate begun at the Reformation has been reflected in the diversity of [[Christian denomination]]s. Some contemporary criticisms of the Catholic Church relate to philosophy and culture e.g., [[Christianity]] vs. [[humanism]]. For this sort of criticism, see [[Criticism of Christianity]].  . 

==Criticism of Catholic beliefs==. 
<!--
“Evangelicals do not find any biblical warrant for the office of the papacy or the elaborate structure of the Roman Catholic Church,” Daniel Akin, president of Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, N. C., told Baptist Press.  . 

“Further, the Catholic system's emphasis on merit, works salvation and veneration of Mary and the saints are issues that those committed to ‘sola scriptura’ could never endorse or affirm,” Akin continued. “While we can appreciate the moral stand on life and marriage of the papacy, we will resolutely maintain that our High Priest is Jesus Christ in whom we have direct access to the true and living God.” . 

Mark DeVine, associate professor of theology at Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Kansas City, Mo., noted, “As Protestants and evangelicals, we deny any special authority to the pope or any other religious leader. We insist that all things be tested by Scripture. We accept the authority of Scripture over all human authority –- as evangelicals and even more so as Protestants. We stand under the Word of God.”<ref>http://www.floridabaptistwitness.com/4208.article</ref>--> . 

===Paganized Christianity===. 
Some believe that the early Church, especially in Rome, was influenced by pagan rituals and beliefs from the [[Roman imperial cult]], [[Hellenistic philosophy]], notably [[Neoplatonism]], and [[Gnosticism]].  . 

Protestants criticize the Catholic Church because it allowed the traditional Roman mysteries and deities of solar monism such as Mithras and Sol Invictus and idol worship back into the church. <ref name = HN1>{{Cite book | last = Newcomb | first = Harvey | authorlink = Harvey Newcomb | title = Great Apostasy: Being an Account of the Origin, Rise and Progress of Corruption and Tryanny in the Church of Rome | publisher = Kessinger Publishing | year = 2003 | pages = ix | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=XZ0JL9AhS0wC&lpg=PA33&dq=the%20great%20apostasy&pg=PR9#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref name = JTC1>{{Cite book | last = Talmage | first = James E.| authorlink = James E.

===Scripture and tradition=== . 

[[Protestantism|Protestants]] and other [[Biblical studies|biblical scholars]] critical of the Catholic Church have questioned its reliance on what is referred to as "Sacred Tradition" (of which Sacred Scripture is a subset) by the Church.  . 

Others countered that the notion of "Sacred Tradition" did not mean custom, but that ''traditio'' that they claim is handed down from God<ref name="CatTrad">{{cite web |url=http://www.beginningcatholic.com/catholic-tradition.html |title=Catholic Tradition:  Life in the Spirit |publisher=beginningcatholic.com |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}</ref> and cites verses of [[2 Thessalonians]] ({{bibleverse|2|Thessalonians|2:15|KJV|}}) "Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle."  Protestants say that Catholics misunderstand this phase which doesn't mean what it appears to say.{{clarity|Okay I'm having a little fun here, but previous version was incorrect. Use KJV with in-line ref for future quotes unless Douay version is clearly different than KJV which rarely happens}} . 

The Church says that Christ handed down the "Sacred Scripture", and as a subset of Sacred Tradition must be interpreted in the context of the community founded by Christ. Protestants say that no biblical evidence supports this. <ref name="CatNotTrue">{{cite web |url=http://www.the-ten-commandments.org/catholic_church_error.html |title=Is the Catholic Church God's true Church and Peter the first Pope? |publisher=the-ten-commandments.org |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}</ref> . 

In the [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] ({{bibleverse||Matthew|15:1-20|KJV|}}), Jesus voices opposition to Pharasitical practice of
tradition. He opposes external rituals, where people may do follow all the ritual perfectly, that may represent faithfulness, but it may not. <ref name="Jesus and Tradition">{{cite web |url=http://bible.org/seriespage/jesus-and-traditions-elders-matthew-151-20 |title=Jesus And The Traditions Of The Elders (Matthew 15:1-20) |author=Allen Ross |publisher=bible.org |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}</ref> Protestants believe that Catholic [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] and services are traditional and therefore suspect under this reading. <ref name="Jesus and Tradition"/> . 

However, Jesus himself celebrated traditional Jewish festivals (Last Supper/Passover,<ref>[http://bible.org/seriespage/last-supper-luke-227-23]</ref> was presented at the temple,<ref>[http://www.how-to-pray-the-rosary-everyday.com/presentation-of-jesus-in-the-temple.html]</ref> was buried according to tradition,<ref>[http://sxcari.blogspot.com/2010/07/burial-of-jesus-and-jewish-burial.html]</ref> created a traditional prayer, the [[Lord's Prayer]],<ref>[http://bible.cc/matthew/6-9.htm]</ref> appeared to institute [[foot washing]] as a tradition,({{bibleverse||John|13:14-17|KJV|}}) and lived and preached as did most Jewish rabbis, traditionally. <!---earlier ref in this para--> . 

====''Sola Scriptura'' and ''Sola Fide''==== . 

[[Protestantism|Protestants]] and [[biblical studies|biblical scholar]]s who have questioned and criticize the Catholic Church's reliance on tradition cite the doctrines of ''[[sola scriptura]]'' (Scripture only) and ''[[sola fide]]'' (faith only). The Catholic Church has historically taught that through faith and good works one can be saved. The Church has followed the teaching of [[Epistle of James]] ({{bibleverse||James|2:24-26|KJV|}}) and other scriptural references. <ref>[http://www.catholicapologetics.org/ap020800.htm]</ref><ref>Dave Armstrong, ''A Biblical Defense of Catholicism''</ref> The Catholic Church disagrees with the [[Martin Luther|Lutheran]] interpretation, adopted by most Protestants, including the ''[[sola scriptura]]'' and ''[[sola fide]]''. <ref>Godfrey, Robert W. [http://www.the-highway.com/Sola_Scriptura_Godfrey.html "What Do We Mean by Sola Scriptura?"]. Retrieved May 27, 2006. </ref> . 

===Catholic Church – One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church=== . 

Section 8 of the [[Second Vatican Council]]'s Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'' stated that "the one Church of Christ which in the [[Nicene Creed]] is professed as [[One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church|one, holy, catholic and apostolic]]" subsists in the Catholic Church, which is governed by the successor of [[Saint Peter|Peter the apostle]] and by the bishops in communion with him (the term ''successor of Peter'' refers to the Bishop of Rome, the [[Pope]]; see [[Petrine theory]]). Likewise, [[Mystici Corporis]] explicitly states "the Catholic Church... is the Church of Christ".  . 

Other Christian denominations, notably [[Protestantism|Protestants]] have rejected the Catholic doctrine that Christ established "only one Church" and that that one Church is the Catholic Church. Protestants also rejected the remark by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] that only the Catholic Church could be properly be called "the Church". <ref>{{cite web|author=John Darling |url=http://www.mailtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070713/NEWS/707130329 |title=Strong reactions emerge to Pope's exclusivity assertion |publisher=MailTribune.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-13}}</ref> [[Pope Benedict XVI]] issued the papal document [[Dominus Iesus]] which stated that Protestant denominations are not churches "in the proper sense."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.religiousherald.org/1497.article |title=Pope says Protestants not churches 'in the proper sense' |date=July 11, 2007 |publisher= Religion News Service |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}</ref> . 

===Opposition to teaching on modern ethical grounds===. 
====Proselytism====. 
[[Wiktionary:proselytize|Proselytism]] is the practice of attempting to convert people to a religion. The Catholic Church is criticised, especially by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] of continuing aggressive proselytism, mainly by the [[Eastern Catholic]] branches of the Catholic Church. <ref>[http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=20511 CWNews]</ref><ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=502329&in_page_id=1811 Daily Mail]</ref> The Church maintains that it "has a duty to evangelize; it is also its inalienable right". <ref>[http://new.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&art=11043 Asia News]</ref> . 

====Interactions with other religious groups====. 
=====Jewish criticism===== . 

In 1998, [[Pope John Paul II]] apologized for past actions by Christians that caused suffering to the Jewish people, calling them "our elder brothers" in the faith. <ref>{{cite web | title =A Pope for the World | publisher =BBC | year =2005 | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/pope/johnpaulii_6.shtml }}</ref> . 

Critics reply that [[Pope Benedict XVI]] was a member of [[Hitler Youth]], a paramilitary organization of the German [[Nazi Party]], although membership was required by law for all 14-year-old German boys after December 1939. <ref>{{cite book |title=The Third Reich in Power |last=Evans |first=Richard J. |authorlink=Richard J. Evans |year=2005 |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn= 1-59420-074-2  |page=272 |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> . 

There are also concerns about Pope Benedict's endorsement of the [[Tridentine Mass]]. Concern by some groups is now focused on the Good Friday liturgy according to the Tridentine missal, which contains a prayer "For the conversion of the Jews". The prayer then refers to Jewish "blindness" and prays for them to be "delivered from their darkness."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6585247.stm Concerns over Pope's Latin Mass move [[BBC World]]]</ref> After protest, the Catholic Church acted by deleting a reference to their "blindness". <ref>[http://www.christiantoday.com/article/after.protests.pope.changes.latin.prayer.for.jews/16692.htm After protests, Pope changes Latin prayer for Jews]</ref> However, Jewish leaders are still disappointed about the revision. <ref>[http://www.eni.ch/news/item.php?id=1645 US Jewish leaders call reintroduction of Latin prayer 'retrogression']</ref> . 

=====Islam=====. 
In 2006 Muslims objected to Pope Benedict XVI quoting the 14th-century Byzantine Christian Emperor Manuel Paleologos II who wrote "Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached."<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/pope/story/0,,1873277,00.html] Complete transcript of Benedict XVI's speech accessed January 7, 2008 from http://www.guardian.co.uk/pope/story/0,,1873277,00.html. </ref> The Pope emphasized that he was quoting the emperor, and he neither agreed with nor disagreed with the statement.  . 

There was considerable response to the pope's quote. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5346480.stm BBC News]</ref> Islamic political and religious leaders expressed their concerns about his speech. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5348436.stm BBC News]</ref> There were protests in much of the Islamic world, including [[Turkey]], the [[West Bank]] of the Jordan,<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14846353/ MSNBC News]</ref> [[Indonesia]], [[Iran]], and especially from terrorist organizations like [[Al-Qaeda]]. <ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/09/17/pope.islam/index.html CNN News]</ref> . 

Turkey's ruling party likened the pope to [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] and accused him of reviving the mentality of the Crusades, while Malaysian PM [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]] said that "The Pope must not take lightly the spread of outrage that has been created". <ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-09-15-pope-protest_x.htm USA Today]</ref> . 

The Pope responded "''In the Muslim world, this quotation has unfortunately been taken as an expression of my personal position, thus arousing understandable indignation. I hope that the reader of my text can see immediately that this sentence does not express my personal view of the Qur’an, for which I have the respect due to the holy book of a great religion. In quoting the text of the Emperor Manuel II, I intended solely to draw out the essential relationship between faith and reason''"<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2006/september/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20060912_university-regensburg_en.html Vatican News]</ref> . 

====Separation of church and state====. 
{{Main|Roman Catholicism's links with political authorities|Separation of church and state}}
<!---this is a wonderful defense to a criticism that hasn't yet been uttered. Needs lead-in--->
Throughout much of the history of Western Civilization, the Catholic Church has exercised many functions in Catholic countries that are more usually associated with government today. Many functions like education, healthcare, and a judicial system covering religious and some social areas were begun and undertaken by the Church.   Certain bishops acted as secular rulers in small states in Italy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]], notably the [[Papal States]], although these were always unusual. The full separation of church and state in Catholic Europe and Latin America was a gradual process that took place over time. The church openly opposed the abuses of Spanish and Portuguese authorities over their colonies during the [[Age of Reason]] and took steps to operate outside of these authorities in spite of protests from the various monarchs. <ref name="SandS">{{cite book |last= Duffy|first= Eamon|others= |title=Saints and Sinners, a History of the Popes|year=1997|publisher= [[Yale University Press]] in association with S4C |isbn=|id=Library of Congress Catalog card number 97-60897 |pages= }}</ref> . 

The Catholic Church has tried to influence governments to preserve Sunday as a day of worship, to restrict or, as in Ireland, Italy and Latin America, [[Law and divorce around the world|forbid divorce]], [[abortion]] and [[euthanasia]]. It has also pressured governments to restrict or not to promote [[Christian views on contraception|the use of contraceptives]].  . 

[[Catholic Social Teaching]] advocates a living wage, proper work hours and fair treatment of workers. <ref>Rerum Novarum http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum_en.html</ref> Freedom to practice one's religion is one of the basic human rights the Church has been noted in defending especially in Communist countries around the world. <ref>[http://econc10.bu.edu/economic_systems/NatIdentity/EE/Germany/CHURCH.html]</ref> . 

====Human sexual behavior and reproductive matters====. 
Some criticize{{Who|date=December 2008}} the Church's teaching on [[human sexual behavior|sexual]] and [[reproduction|reproductive]] matters. The Church teaches the practice of chastity. It interprets this to mean that believers should eschew sexual activity outside of heterosexual marriage, including [[masturbation]], [[sodomy]] and [[homosexuality|homosexual practices]],<ref>[http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3sect2chpt2art6.shtml#2357 CCC 2357]</ref>  [[birth control|artificial contraception]],<ref>[http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3sect2chpt2art6.shtml#2370 CCC 2370]</ref>  as well as procuring or assisting in an [[abortion]]. <ref>[http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3sect2chpt2art5.shtml#2272 CCC 2272]</ref> . 

The official Catholic teaching regards sexuality as "naturally ordered to the good of spouses" as well as the generation of children. <ref>[http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3sect2chpt2art6.shtml#2353 CCC 2353]</ref> . 

Some criticize{{Who|date=December 2008}} the Church's teaching on [[fidelity]], [[sexual abstinence]] and its opposition to promoting the use of [[condom]]s (as a strategy to prevent pregnancy and the spread of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] and other [[sexually transmitted infection|STDs]]) as counterproductive. <ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/vaticancityandholysee/5005357/Pope-Benedict-XVI-condoms-make-Aids-crisis-worse.html Pope Benedict XVI: condoms make Aids crisis worse]</ref> The Catholic Church has been criticized for its [[pro-life]] efforts in all phases of society. The Church's denial of the use of condoms has provoked criticism especially in countries where [[AIDS]] and [[HIV]] infections are at epidemic proportions. The Church maintains that countries like Kenya where behavioral changes like abstinence are endorsed instead of condom use, are experiencing greater progress towards controlling the disease than those countries just promoting condoms. <ref>{{cite web | last =Dugger | first =Carol | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Why is Kenya's AIDS rate plummeting?

=====Opposition to contraception=====. 
The Catholic Church maintains its opposition to artificial means of [[birth control]]. Some Catholic Church members and non-members criticize this belief as contributing to [[overpopulation]] and [[poverty]]. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/382895.stm | work=BBC News | title=Is the Vatican wrong on population control? | date=1999-07-09 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref> . 

Pope Paul VI reaffirmed the Church's position in his 1968 encyclical ''[[Humanae Vitae]]'' (Human Life). In this encyclical, the Pope acknowledges the realities of modern life, scientific advances, as well as the questions and challenges these raise. Furthermore, he explains that the purpose of intercourse is both "unitive and procreative", that is to say it strengthens the relationship of the husband and wife as well as offering the chance of creating new life. As such, it is a natural and full expression of our humanity. He writes that contraception "contradicts the will of the Author of life [God]. Hence to use this divine gift [sexual intercourse] while depriving it, even if only partially, of its meaning and purpose, is equally repugnant to the nature of man and of woman, and is consequently in opposition to the plan of God and His holy will."<ref name="vatican.va">{{cite web|author=Paul VI |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html |title=Humanae Vitae - Encyclical Letter of His Holiness Paul VI on the regulation of birth, 25 July 1968 |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2010-06-13}}</ref> . 

Supporters of birth control argue that economic growth which allows for a high population density without poverty is a direct function of the availability of birth control, as it leads to smaller families (as is the case in all nations which allow birth control), which in turn have more purchasing power to support themselves and provide their children with [[education]], which is universally recognized as necessary for sustainable growth.  . 

The Church counters this argument stating that "Though it is true that sometimes it is lawful to tolerate a lesser moral evil in order to avoid a greater evil or in order to promote a greater good, it is never lawful, even for the gravest reasons, to do evil that good may come of it —in other words, to intend directly something which of its very nature contradicts the moral order, and which must therefore be judged unworthy of man, even though the intention is to protect or promote the welfare of an individual, of a family or of society in general. Consequently, it is a serious error to think that a whole married life of otherwise normal relations can justify sexual intercourse which is deliberately contraceptive and so intrinsically wrong."<ref name="vatican.va"/> . 

The Church stands by its doctrines on sexual intercourse as defined by the [[Natural law]]: intercourse must at once be both the renewal of the consummation of marriage and open to procreation. If each of these postulates are not met, the act of intercourse is, according to Natural Law, an ''objective'' mortal sin. Therefore, since artificial contraception expressly prevents the creation of a new life (and, the Church would argue, removes the sovereignty of God over all of Creation), contraception is unacceptable. The Church sees abstinence as the only objective moral strategy for preventing the transmission of HIV. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.com/library/Contraception_and_Sterilization.asp |title=Contraception and Sterilization |publisher=Catholic.com |date=2004-08-10 |accessdate=2010-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.com/library/Birth_Control.asp |title=Birth Control |publisher=Catholic.com |date=2004-08-10 |accessdate=2010-06-13}}</ref> . 

The Church has been criticized for its opposition to promoting the use of [[condom]]s as a strategy to prevent the spread of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], teen pregnancy, and [[Sexually transmitted infection|STDs]].  . 

Cardinal Javier Lozano Barragán, President of the Pontifical Council for Pastoral Assistance to Health Care Workers, has stated that Pope Benedict XVI asked his department to study the question of condom use as part of a broad look at several questions of bioethics. <ref>{{cite web |title=Catholics and Condoms |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12615605/site/newsweek/ |last=Dickey |first=Christopher |year=2006 |month=May |work=Newsweek |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=2006-09-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060706151758/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/12615605/site/newsweek/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-07-06}}</ref> However, the president of the [[Pontifical Council for the Family]], Cardinal Trujillo, in an interview reported by Catholic News Agency on May 4, 2006, said that the Church "maintains unmodified the teaching on condoms", and added that the Pope had "not ordered any studies about modifying the prohibition on condom use."<ref>{{cite web |title=Church 'will not budge one inch' on issue of condom use, says Cardinal Lopez Trujillo |url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=6641 |publisher=Catholic News Agency |year=2006 |month=May |accessdate=2006-09-16}}</ref> . 

==Criticism of Catholic prayer and worship==. 
===Sacrifice of the Mass===. 
Amongst the gravest of criticisms made by non-Catholic Christians of the Catholic Church surround those criticizing the central Catholic worship service: "The Holy Sacrifice of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]", also called [[Holy Communion]]. For Catholics it is the centre and summit of Catholic worship and the greatest of the seven sacraments of the Church. Protestants almost universally criticize the idea that the Holy Communion as celebrated in Catholic churches has the nature of a sacrifice; that is, Christ becomes wholly and really present under the forms of bread and wine, and He is offered to God by the Catholic priest for the remission of sins, by means of eating the Host (Christ's body) and drinking the Wine (Christ's blood). This doctrine is strongly reflected in that part of the Pre-[[Vatican II]] [[Tridentine Mass]] called the Offertory, where the Priest offers the bread (the Host or "hostia", meaning "victim") with the following prayer: "Receive...almighty and everlasting God, this spotless Host, which I thine unworthy servant now offer unto thee... for my countless sins, wickedness and neglect; and for all those here present, as also for all the faithful in Christ, both the quick and the dead, that it may set forward their salvation and mine, unto life everlasting.  Amen."<ref>Missale Romanum, Juxtam Typicam Vaticanum, 2004</ref>  He likewise offers the wine using similar language.  . 

The German Reformer [[Martin Luther]] strongly criticizes this belief: "They [Catholics] made the sacrament which they should accept from God, namely, the body and blood of Christ, into a sacrifice and have offered it to the selfsame God...Furthermore, they do not regard Christ's body and blood as a sacrifice of thanksgiving, but as a sacrifice of works...This is the true and chief abomination and the basis of all blasphemy in the papacy."<ref>[http://www.mtio.com/articles/bissar92.htm#8 Luther and the Mass - Justification and the Joint Declaration - by Daniel Preus]</ref> The [[Church of England]], in the [[Book of Common Prayer]], Article of Religion #31, uses similarly strong language: "Wherefore the sacrifice of Masses, in the which it was commonly said, that the Priest did offer Christ for the quick and the dead, to have remission of pain and guilt, were blasphemous fables, and dangerous deceits."<ref>Book Of Common Prayer, WM Collins Sons & Co., 1662/1968</ref> . 

Catholics maintain that the sacrifice of the Mass is the same sacrifice that Christ offered "once for all", not a new or separate one, and that when Catholics participate in the celebration of the Mass, they are actually present at it. The Council of Trent says the Mass is the means "whereby that bloody sacrifice once to be accomplished on the Cross might be represented, the memory thereof remain even to the end of the world, and its salutary effects applied to the remission of those sins which we daily commit" (Session 22, chapter 1).  . 

===Saints===. 
Catholics have venerated Mary and other saints for supplication, or requested help of some sort. Prayers to the saints have their origin in the earliest centuries of the Catholic Church. Some [[Protestant]] [[Christians]] argued that in order for Mary and the saints to actually hear all the prayers directed to them, they would by necessity be required to possess the attributes of [[omniscience]] and [[omnipresence]], thus allowing them to know all the requests made by either ultimate knowledge or by actually being present with each supplicant simultaneously. Many Protestant churches have not traditionally called on the saints or apostles as intermediaries as do Catholics, citing 1 Tim. 2:5<ref>[http://bible.cc/1_timothy/2-5.htm "...one mediator between God and man..."]</ref> to support this view.  . 

Catholics answer that when they have prayed to a saint they have asked the saint to pray to God for them, not to have the saint do something for them personally. For Catholics, belief in the "[[Communion of Saints]]" means that death does not separate believers and requesting prayers of a saint is the same as asking any friend. They also say that Christians have historically believed that only material beings occupy time and space. Spirits, saints and angels do not occupy space nor are they subject to linear time. <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=BpabIG5nJiIC&pg=PA101&lpg=PA101&dq=catholics+spirits+do+not+occupy+space+-wikipedia&source=web&ots=mEq8gw3D1L&sig=hClIn_A0YnW5qDQOKFBdvVg9DrI What Catholics Believe]</ref> This, they argue, would suggest that angels and saints do not need to be omnipresent or omnipotent to answer prayers. Apart from all time and space, they participate in the life of God in Heaven, through [[Theosis]].  . 

===Mariology===. 
:''For the critics of the traditional role of women in [[Latin America]], see'': [[Marianismo]]. 
[[R. Albert Mohler, Jr.]], president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, asserted "The issue of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] remains one of the hottest debates on the Protestant/Catholic divide, and new proposals for Marian doctrines are likely to ignite a theological conflagration. It has been suggested by some Protestant writers that the Catholics worship Mary as a [[goddess]]."<ref name='The worship of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the church of Rome'>{{cite book | author= Tyler, James Endell |title=The worship of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the church of Rome |year=1851|quote=This worship of the Virgin Mary in the Church of Rome may be conveniently examined under the following heads:—
First, prayers offered to the Almighty in her name, for her merits, through her mediation, advocacy, and intercession. 
Secondly, prayers to herself, beseeching her to employ her good offices of intercession with the Eternal Father, and with her Son, in behalf of her petitioners. 
Thirdly, prayers to her directly for her protection from all evils, spiritual and bodily; for her guidance and aid, and for the influences of her grace. 
Fourthly, must be added the ascription of divine praises to her, in acknowledgment of her attributes and acts of power, wisdom, goodness, and mercy, and of her exalted state above all the spirits of life and glory in heaven; and for her share in the redemption of the world, and the benefits conferred by her on the individual worshiper. }}</ref> These suggestions continue to be made in recent times.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} However, the Catholic Church teaches that Mary is a created being, not a goddess, and has always taught that adoration (''latria'') is due to God alone and not to any created being. Mary is only honoured, as she is the [[Theotokos|Mother of God]]— not in the sense that she is the mother of pre-existent [[Divine Nature]], but in the sense that she gave birth to Christ, who is God.  . 

===Use of Latin===. 
Before the reforms from [[Vatican II]] in the late 1960s the Catholic Church was best-known outside the church for the [[Tridentine Mass]], said mostly in [[Latin]] with a few sentences in [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. <ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/LITURGY/TRIDMASS.TXT Ordinary of the Tridentine Mass, 1962 Edition]</ref> . 

Since 1970, the Mass has been celebrated in the local language of where it is celebrated and the Mass in Latin has largely fallen into disuse. The vernacular Mass is also known as the Mass of Pope [[Paul VI]], as he was the Pope who promulgated the vernacular missal. A minority of Roman Catholics however prefer the Mass to be celebrated in Latin, generally arguing that the Latin text is more authentic as regards, and truer to scripture and doctrine than the so-called "New Order" Mass. <ref>[http://www.olrl.org/new_mass/evils.shtml Why the Traditional Latin Mass? - The Evils of the New Liturgy]</ref> It should be noted that since 1970 the use of the Latin Mass has been severely restricted, and even declared illegal in some dioceses. However, in 2007, Pope [[Benedict XVI]] loosened some restrictions on its use with the aim of healing the rift that had come about between advocates of the New Order Mass and those of the Tridentine Mass. <ref>[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1641008,00.html Why the Pope is Boosting Latin Mass - Time]</ref> . 

However, during the time of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], [[Protestantism|Protestants]] almost totally rejected the use of Latin as ''"[[hocus Pocus (magic)|hocus pocus]]"''. The 1662 edition of the [[Church of England]]'s [[Book of Common Prayer]] has a specific article (no. 24 of the Articles of Religion) devoted to the topic. It reads concisely and directly, "It is a thing repugnant to the Word of God, and the custom of the Primitive Church, to have publick [sic] Prayer in the Church, or to minister the Sacraments in a tongue not understanded [sic] of the people." This is backed by a statement in the section Concerning the Service of the Church which states: "Whereas Saint Paul would have such language spoken to people in the Church, as they might understand, and have profit by hearing the same; the service in this Church of ''England'' these many years hath [sic] been read in Latin to the people, which they understand not; so that they have heard with their ears only, and their heart, spirit, and mind, have not been edified thereby."<ref>[Book Of Common Prayer, 1662/1968, WM. Collins & Sons, Glasgow]</ref> . 

The [[Gallican church|French Catholic Church]] in the 18th century adapted [[vernacular]] [[missal]]s in some dioceses. In 1794 the [[Synod of Pistoia]], firmly influenced by [[Jansenism]], rejected the use of Latin and demanded the use of the vernacular. In the 19th century the [[Old Catholic Church|"Old Catholic" anti-primacy movements]] adopted the vernacular liturgy along with other reforms. In 1962 the encyclical ''[[Veterum sapientia]]'' of [[Pope John XXIII]] instructed priests and seminaries to hold to the all-Latin [[Mass]] and to promote studying the Latin language. While the [[Second Vatican Council]] for the first time allowed the use of the vernacular in the liturgy of the Mass, it also demanded conservation of the use of Latin and stimulated Latin [[Gregorian chant]]. The [[Mass of Paul VI|new, 1970 edition of the reformed Roman Missal]] allowed for a worldwide use of the vernacular in the Eucharist for the first time.  . 

===Traditionalist Catholics and sedevacantists===. 
[[Traditionalist Catholic]]s see the Church's recent efforts at reformed teaching and (liturgical) practice (known as "aggiornamento"), in particular the [[Second Vatican Council]], as not benefitting the advancement of the Church. Some groups,{{Who|date=December 2008}} claiming the Church has betrayed the core values of Catholicism, have rejected some of the decisions of the Holy See that they see harmful to the faith. They have in common the firm adherence to the Tridentine Latin Mass that was used, with some changes, for 400 years prior to 1970.  . 

A numerically minor group, the [[Sedevacantism|sedevacantists]], have characterized the current Pontiffs of the Catholic Church as [[heresy|heretics]]. This group claims that the current Pope (as well, perhaps, as some of his immediate predecessors) were not legitimate. [[Sedeprivationism|Sedeprivationists]] claim the post-conciliar Popes were still materially Popes, but formally non-Catholics due to formal personal and public heresy.{{Clarify|date=August 2007}} . 

Another tiny, extreme group of Vatican II opponents, known as [[conclavism|conclavists]], have appointed papal replacements: see [[List of historical antipopes|list of conclavist antipopes]]. These groups were estimated to comprise not more than a few hundred followers worldwide.  . 

On the other hand, some non-Catholic{{Who|date=December 2008}}{{Dubious|date=August 2007}} historians have seen a clear continuity of the teachings of the Church throughout the centuries, a "handing over" (''traditio'') of "living faith" which according to [[George Weigel]] "inspires innovative thinking." . 

==Criticism of Catholic organization==. 
===Head of the church===. 
{{Main|Papal infallibility}} . 

The supremacy of the Pope, the usage of Holy Father to refer to the Pope, and his [[Papal infallibility|infallibility]] have been subject to criticism by other Christian denominations.  . 

In Catholic theology, [[Papal infallibility]] is the dogma that the [[Pope]] is preserved from error when he solemnly promulgated, or declared, to the Church solely on faith or morals. This doctrine has a long history,{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} but was not defined dogmatically until the [[First Vatican Council]] of 1870. In Catholic theology, papal infallibility was one of the channels of the [[Infallibility of the Church]]. The Church claims that the [[Papal infallibility]] on limited theological matters does not signify that the Pope was a man specially exempt from liability to sin. Critics claim that this statement is self-contradictory. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://apologetics.scriptmania.com/2900.htm |title=The Most Unholy "Holy Fathers" |publisher=scriptmania.com |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}</ref>  . 

Adherents of the Church believe that only the Church can interpret the scriptures in the [[Bible]]; the pope may be the final arbiter if there are differences. But according to [[2 Peter]],<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+1%3A20-21&version=NIV 1:20-21]</ref> anyone can interpret the word of God (by His guidance). <ref name="CatNotTrue"/> . 

The [[Old Catholic Church]]es, organized in the [[Utrecht Union|Union of Ultrajectine Independent Catholic Churches]], resisted Papal infallibility along with the [[First Vatican Council]]'s dogma of Papal primacy of universal jurisdiction.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} . 

===Clerical celibacy===. 
{{Main|Clerical celibacy}} . 

Mandatory priestly celibacy first appeared for the Spanish clergy at the [[Synod of Elvira]] in 306-306. This was reinforced by the pope in the [[Directa Decretal]] in 385, which stated that it was derived from the Apostles. It was again reinforced clearly for the entire church in the Middle Ages, as a result of the [[Second Lateran Council]] in 1139. <ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09017a.htm| title=Second Lateran Council| accessdate=2011-11-13 |publisher=The Catholic Encyclopedia}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.crusadeagainstclergyabuse.com/htm/AShortHistory.htm|author=Rev. Thomas Doyle |title=A Very Short History of Clergy Sexual Abuse in the Catholic Church| accessdate=2011-11-13 }}</ref> The Catholic Church's requirement of a vow of [[celibacy]] from [[Latin rite]] priests (while allowing very limited individual exceptions) is criticized for differing from Christian traditions issuing from the [[Protestant Reformation]], which apply no limitations, and even from the practice of the ancient [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. While requiring celibacy for bishops and [[priestmonk]]s and excluding marriage by priests after ordination, the latter churches allow married men to be ordained to the priesthood and diaconate. The Latin rite also permits married men to be ordained as deacons.  . 

In July 2006, Bishop [[Emmanuel Milingo]] created the organization [[Married Priests Now!]]. <ref>{{cite news | url = http://wpherald.com/articles/326/1/Archbishop-launches-married-priests-movement/quotMarried-Priests-Nowquot.html | title = Archbishop launches married priests movement |date=2006-07-14 | work = World Peace Herald | accessdate = 2006-11-16}}</ref> Responding to Milingo's November 2006 consecration of bishops, the Vatican stated "The value of the choice of priestly celibacy... has been reaffirmed."<ref>{{cite news | title = Vatican stands by celibacy ruling | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6153452.stm | publisher = BBC News |date=2006-11-16 | accessdate = 2006-11-16 }}</ref> . 

In the wake of the [[Catholic sex abuse cases|clergy sexual abuse scandals]], some critics{{Who|date=December 2008}} have charged that priestly celibacy was a contributing factor. ([[#Sexual abuse controversy|see below]]) . 

Protestant apologists further argue that clerical celibacy violates the Biblical teaching in the [[First Epistle to Timothy]]:<ref name=WELS-Lent>[http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID=19&cuItem_itemID=15268 WELS Topical Q&A: Roman Catholic Lent]</ref> . 

{{cquote|"''The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth. For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving.''"<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Timothy|4:1-4|9}}</ref>}} . 

However, the Church's tradition of celibacy traces its beginnings to both Jesus, who encouraged his apostles to be celibate if they were able to do so,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} and to [[St. Paul]], who wrote of the advantages celibacy allowed a man in serving the Lord. <ref name="Bainton64">Bainton, ''Horizon History of Christianity'' (1964), p. 64</ref> Thus, from the Church's beginnings, clerical celibacy was "held in high esteem" and is considered a kind of spiritual marriage with Christ, a concept further popularized by the early Christian theologian [[Origen]]. <ref name="Bokenkotter54">Bokenkotter, ''A Concise History of the Catholic Church'' Doubleday (2004), p. 54, ISBN 0-385-50584-1</ref>  About 300, the [[Synod of Elvira]] called for clerical celibacy . Clerical celibacy began to be enforced in papal [[decretals]] beginning with [[Pope Siricius]] (d. 399). <ref name="Bokenkotter54"/> In 1074, mandatory celibacy of the clergy became canon law as part of [[Pope Gregory VII]]'s effort to eliminate several forms of medieval church corruption. <ref name="Bainton172">Bainton, ''Horizon History of Christianity'' (1964), p. 172</ref> . 

Martin Luther responded in his works "''On Monastic Vows''": . 

{{cquote|"''If you obey the gospel, you ought to regard celibacy as a matter of free choice...They [Jesus and Paul] glory in faith alone. They praise celibacy not because the chaste are more perfect than others because they are chaste, and not because they do not lust contrary to the command, but because they are free from the cares and tribulation of the flesh which Paul attributes to marriage [1 Corinthians 7:32], and may freely and without hindrance dedicate themselves day and night to the word and faith.''"<ref>''Luther's Works'', American Edition, Volume 44, pp.262-264</ref>}} . 

Confessional Lutherans, claiming the Bible as the only authority in all matters of Christian doctrine, criticize the tradition of forced celibacy: . 

{{cquote|"''In 1 Corinthians 7 the apostle Paul discusses the matter of the celibate life versus marriage. 'Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I am. But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion' (verses 8-9)...The Bible says forbidding marriage and commanding people to abstain from certain foods are doctrines of demons (1 Timothy 4:1-4).''"<!----When the pope tells priests, they can't marry and he tells us we can't eat meat on Friday without sinning, we know that teaching can't come from God.----><ref>[http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID=34&cuItem_itemID=3914 WELS Topical Q&A: Marriage Relationships - Marriage]</ref><ref name=ref name=WELS-Lent/>}} . 

Generally, Protestantism claims that celibacy is not a scriptural requirement for the ministry. <ref>[http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID=69&cuItem_itemID=11155 WELS Topical Q&A: Called Worker Pastor vs. Priest and Celibacy]</ref> . 

===Women's rights===. 
:''For the critics of the traditional role of women in [[Latin America]], see'': [[Marianismo]].  . 

===Ordination of women=== . 

The Catholic Church has always excluded women from the ordained clergy, and so excluded from many of the church decisions. Starting in the late twentieth century this was seen by some{{Who|date=December 2008}} (including some Catholics) as unjust discrimination (at a time when [[feminism|feminist]] and other movements have advocated equal access for women to traditionally male professions).  . 

As a result of [[feminism]] and other social and political movements that have removed barriers to the entry of women into professions that were traditionally male strongholds, in the latter quarter of the twentieth century many women in a handful of countries sought ordination into the Catholic priesthood. The Church is convinced that it is not free to change this practice, which the Church traced back to Jesus himself, and has declared the matter closed for discussion.  . 

The Catholic position (as well as that of the Orthodox and, arguably, other ancient churches), is that this has been the clear teaching of the Church since the time of the Apostles. As the Priest is acting 'in persona Christi' (that is, in the Person of Christ) and Christ took the body of a man, the priest must be a man: "Only a baptized man (''vir'') validly receives sacred ordination." Paragraph 1577 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church states: "The Lord Jesus chose men (''viri'') to form the college of the twelve apostles, and the apostles did the same when they chose collaborators to succeed them in their ministry. The college of bishops, with whom the priests are united in the priesthood, makes the college of the twelve an ever-present and ever-active reality until Christ's return. The Church recognises herself to be bound by this choice made by the Lord himself. For this reason the ordination of women is not possible."<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/1577.htm CCC Search Result - Paragraph # 1577<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . 

On May 22, 1994, Pope John Paul II issued an apostolic letter, ''[[Ordinatio Sacerdotalis]]'' (on Priestly Ordination) which reaffirmed the traditional position, and concluded: . 

:''Although the teaching that priestly ordination is to be reserved to men alone has been preserved by the constant and universal Tradition of the Church and firmly taught by the Magisterium in its more recent documents, at the present time in some places it is nonetheless considered still open to debate, or the Church's judgment that women are not to be admitted to ordination is considered to have a merely disciplinary force.'' . 

:''Wherefore, in order that all doubt may be removed regarding a matter of great importance, a matter which pertains to the Church's divine constitution itself, in virtue of my ministry of confirming the brethren (cf. [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 22:32) I declare that the Church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the Church's faithful.''<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_22051994_ordinatio-sacerdotalis_en.html Ordinatio Sacerdotalis, John Paul II, 22 May 1994 - Apostolic Letter<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . 

Within Catholicism itself, debate on the subject now largely focuses on whether this statement is meant to invoke extraordinary [[papal infallibility]] and raise the rule that women cannot be Catholic priests to the level of [[dogma]] (thus unchangeable) of the Roman Catholic Church.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} That disagreement as to the status reached to the heart of the Church. However, its infallibility was asserted by the CDF in its Responsum Ad Dubium on October 28, 1995, when they responded to a Bishop's inquiry with the following: . 

:''"This teaching requires definitive assent, since, founded on the written Word of God, and from the beginning constantly preserved and applied in the Tradition of the Church, it has been set forth infallibly by the ordinary and universal Magisterium (cf. Second Vatican Council, Dogmatic Constitution on the Church Lumen Gentium 25, 2). Thus, in the present circumstances, the Roman Pontiff, exercising his proper office of confirming the brethren (cf. Lk 22:32), has handed on this same teaching by a formal declaration, explicitly stating what is to be held always, everywhere, and by all, as belonging to the deposit of the faith.'' . 

:''The Sovereign Pontiff John Paul II, at the Audience granted to the undersigned Cardinal Prefect, approved this Reply, adopted in the ordinary session of this Congregation, and ordered it to be published."'' . 

Critics{{Who|date=December 2008}} accused some of those attached to the Congregation of trying to make the document ''sound'' infallible to try to kill debate, in effect ''spinning'' a fallible document as infallible. Such an accusation has been made in the past, notably concerning Pope Paul's encyclical, [[Humanae Vitae|''Humanæ Vitæ'']].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} . 

Those criticisms are based on what some Catholics consider to be a faulty understanding of the doctrine of infallibility. Others say that what is missed by those who make these criticisms is that "what has always been taught" is, according to Catholicism, as infallible as a solemn definition that springs from something which the pope declares to be infallible. That which has always been taught by the Church is a part of its Universal Magisterium, which is as infallible as such solemn definitions as that used to define the [[Assumption of Mary]]. Even a layperson is considered to be infallible when he would simply repeat what the church has always taught. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} . 

==Criticism of Catholic actions in history==. 
This section, organized chronologically, covers some of the historical actions for which the Western church and the Catholic Church, have been criticised.  . 

===Persecution of heresy and heretics===. 
{{See also|Christian heresy#Catholic response to heresy|l1=Catholic response to heresy}} . 

Before the twelfth century, the Great Church<ref>The Great Church are those Christians and their leaders that endorsed [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]], (or before Chalcedon, those standing with the great majority in earlier [[Ecumenical council|councils]]). They later divided into the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Catholic Church|Western Catholic Church]]. </ref> gradually suppressed what it saw as [[heresy]] usually through a system of ecclesiastical proscription, [[excommunication]], [[anathema]], and imprisonment. During this time in history, an accusation of heresy could be construed as treason against lawful civil rule, and therefore punishable by death, though this penalty was not frequently imposed, as this form of punishment had many ecclesiastical opponents. <ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08026a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Inquisition]</ref><ref>[http://bulfinch.englishatheist.org/mm/inquisition/Chapter7.htm A History of the Inquisition In The Middle Ages. By Henry Charles Lea. Volume 1]</ref> Later those convicted of heresy were often handed to the state for execution under state laws.  . 

===Crusades===. 
{{Main|Crusades}}
The Crusades were a series of military conflicts of a [[religious war|religious character]] waged by much of Christian [[Europe]] against external and internal threats. Crusades were fought against [[Muslim]]s, [[Paganism|pagan]] [[Slavs]], [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox Christians]], [[Mongols]], [[Cathars]], [[Hussites]] and political enemies of the [[pope]]s. <ref name="OHC" />  Crusaders took [[vow]]s and were granted an [[indulgence]]. <ref name="OHC">Riley-Smith, Jonathan. ''The Oxford History of the Crusades'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. ISBN 0-19-285364-3. </ref> . 

Elements of the Crusades were criticized by some from the time of their inception in 1095. For example, [[Roger Bacon]] felt the Crusades were not effective because, "those who survive, together with their children, are more and more embittered against the Christian faith."<ref name="AC">Riley-Smith, Jonathan. ''The Atlas of the Crusades'' New York: Facts on File, 1990. ISBN 0-8160-2186-4. </ref> In spite of some criticism, the movement was still widely supported in Europe long after the fall of Acre in 1291. From that time forward, the Crusades to recover [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] and the Christian East were largely lost. Later, [[Age of Enlightenment|18th century rationalists]] judged the Crusaders harshly. As recently as the 1950s, Sir [[Steven Runciman]] published a highly critical account of the Crusades which referred to Holy War as "a sin against the Holy Ghost". <ref name="AC" /> . 

Medieval Europe consisted of hundreds of small states and principalities. Simultaneously, Europe faced encroachment of Muslim military forces from both the East via the Balkins and the West via Spain and North Africa. The Catholic Church, representing all of Western Christendom, encouraged [[crusades]] against Islamic controlled territories in Europe and in the [[Holy Land]] from 1095 through 1272 after Islam had conquered most of the Byzantian empire, including the Holy Land.  . 

===Inquisition===. 
{{Main|Inquisition}}
{{See also|List of people burned as heretics}} . 

The Inquisitions of Medieval Europe were partially born out of the effort to drive Muslims out of Europe, an effort which was partly successful. Recent popes, such as John Paul II and Benedict XVI, have worked for improved relations with other churches and religions by holding ecumenical and interfaith discussions trying to find common ground on certain issues.  . 

During the [[Inquisition#Medieval|Inquisition]], the governments of [[Spain]] (and [[Italy]], and sometimes [[France]]) prosecuted those Christians who publicly dissented from key doctrines of the Catholic Faith. Believing that the souls of those deemed to be heretics were in danger of being consigned to hell, the authorities used whatever means they considered necessary to bring about a recantation. Although the Church originally condoned these proceedings, they were difficult to regulate, and abuses eventually caused the Pope to call for an end to them. In spite of (relatively rare) instances of torture and wrongful execution, it was still widely considered in Europe to be the fairest (and most merciful) judicial system in Europe at that time, as evidenced by records of people blaspheming in secular courts intentionally for them to be brought before the Inquisition for a more just and fair trial. <ref>{{cite book|last=Lea|first=Henry Charles|title=A History of the Inquistion of Spain|publisher=THE LIBRARY OF IBERIAN RESOURCES ONLINE|url=http://libro.uca.edu/lea4/8lea15.htm|chapter=BOOK 8: Spheres of Action CHAPTER 15 BLASPHEMY|quote=1624, a young soldier who, when put in the stocks, exclaimed "I renounce God and the saints; devils why don't you come and carry me off?" when duly tried with all formality by the Valladolid tribunal, was discharged with a reprimand and without a sentence. }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=O'Brien|first=Edward|title=A New Look At the Spanish Inquisition|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/homelibr/spaninq.txt|publisher=[[Eternal Word Television Network]]|accessdate=12 July 2010|quote=Prisoners in Spanish secular courts, knowing this  would sometimes blaspheme in order to be sent to the courts of the Inquisition where  conditions were better. }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Madden|first=Thomas F|title=The Real Inquisition|url=http://old.nationalreview.com/comment/madden200406181026.asp|work=Investigating the popular myth|publisher=[[National Review]]|accessdate=12 July 2010|quote=Compared to other medieval secular courts, the Inquisition was positively enlightened. }}</ref> . 

===Anti-semitism in medieval Europe===. 
{{See also|Antisemitism in Europe (Middle Ages)}} . 

In the [[Middle Ages]], religion played a major role in driving [[antisemitism]]. Though not part of [[Catholic]] [[dogma]], many Christians, including members of the [[clergy]], have held the Jewish people collectively responsible for killing Jesus.  . 

As stated in the [[Boston College]] Guide to Passion Plays, "Over the course of time, Christians began to accept... that the Jewish people as a whole were responsible for killing Jesus. According to this interpretation, both the [[Jew]]s present at Jesus’ death and the Jewish people collectively and for all time, have committed the sin of [[deicide]], or God-killing. For 1900 years of Christian-Jewish history, the charge of deicide has led to hatred, violence against and murder of Jews in Europe and America."<ref name=Paley>Paley, Susan and Koesters, Adrian Gibbons, eds. [http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/pdf/ViewersGuide.pdf "A Viewer's Guide to Contemporary Passion Plays"]. Retrieved March 12, 2006.{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref> . 

The [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]], summoned by Pope [[Innocent III]] with his papal bull of 19 April 1213, approved ‘Canon 68’. It required Jews and [[Muslim]]s to wear [[Jewish hat|special dress]] or [[Yellow badge|badges]] to enable them to be distinguished from Christians. They were also forbidden to hold any public offices.  . 

===Reformation===. 
{{Main|Anti-Protestantism}}
{{Main|European wars of religion}}
The [[Protestant Reformation]] (16th century in Europe) came about in no small part due to abuses of church practices by corrupt clergy in addition to these same theological disputes. <ref name="Multiple Authors 2003 11,93, 106, 112, 174, 140, 141"/> Before the Reformation, the Catholic Church had a uniquely powerful position in the political order of medieval western Europe; its clergymen occupied a privileged location in the social class structure; and theologically, it claimed to be the only legitimate Christian Church. Because Protestantism emerged from within the Catholic Church, and began as a protest against Catholic worldly practice and religious doctrine, the Papacy and Catholic rulers felt compelled to deal with Protestantism as a dangerous, destabilising influence in politics and society, as well as characterising Protestants as heretical and [[Schism (religion)|schismatic]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} . 

Within a few decades after the Reformation, governments in most of Europe sought to impose a particular religion, whether Catholicism or a variety of Protestantism, on all the population they ruled. Apart from outright war, members of the "wrong" church were often persecuted or driven into exile. In Catholic countries, the [[Spanish Inquisition]] and the [[Council of Troubles]] in the Habsburg [[Seventeen Provinces|Netherlands]] were among the bodies pursuing persecution by judicial means. In France, the [[French Wars of Religion]] included numerous massacres, most notoriously the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of 1572. After a long peace following the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1598, [[Louis XIV]] reopened the issue in the late 17th century, and the persecution known as the [[Dragonnade]]s was followed in 1685 by the [[Edict of Fontainebleau|Revocation of the Edict of Nantes]] and the expulsion of all [[Huguenot|French Protestants]]. Religious refugees from both sides were common in many parts of Europe. The Vatican long remained opposed to the limited [[religious toleration]] that gradually became accepted in many parts of Europe.  . 

With the consolidation of Protestantism, the extirpation of 'heretics' became a much broader and more complex enterprise, complicated by the politics of territorial Protestant powers, especially in northern Europe. Persecution of Protestant groups ended only as Europe's rulers tired of fighting each other, despite the objections of the Pope, especially at the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]].  .

[[Ante Pavelić]], the leader of the [[Ustaše]] in Croatia during World War II, was granted a "devotional" audience with Pius XII in Rome. <ref name="c252">Cornwell, 1999, p. 252. </ref> The historian John Cornwell views this act as "de facto recognition by the Holy See" of the Independent State of Croatia, which committed genocide against its Serb, Jewish and Roma citizens. <ref name="c252"/> Soon afterwards, Abbot [[Ramiro Marcone]] was appointed [[apostolic legate]] to [[Zagreb]]. <ref name="c252"/>  Cornwell is unsure whether the Vatican was aware of the exact atrocities committed by the Ustaše by this point, but he noted "it was known from the very beginning that Pavelic was a totalitarian dictator, a puppet of Hitler and Mussolini, that he had passed a series of viciously racist and anti-Semitic laws, and that he was bent on enforced conversions from Orthodox to Catholic Christianity". <ref name="c252"/> . 

[[Corrado Zoli]] and [[Evelyn Waugh]] have argued that many Catholic clergy members participated directly or indirectly in Ustaša campaigns of violence. <ref>Phayer, Michael. 2000. The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930–1965. Indianapolis: Indiana University Press. pgs. 34-5</ref> The most notorious example is that of expelled Franciscan [[Miroslav Filipović]], known as "the devil of Jasenovac" for running the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]], where estimates of the number killed range between 49,600 and 600,000. <ref>Phayer, Michael. 2000. The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930–1965. Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, pg. 34-35</ref><ref>Phayer, Michael. 2000. The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930–1965. Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, pg.38</ref><ref>[http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%206358.pdf] [[Yad Vashem]]</ref> [[Ivan Šarić]] is believed to have been the "worst" of the Catholic bishops who supported the Ustaša; his diocesan newspaper wrote: "there is no limit to love. The movement of liberation of the world from the [[Jews]] is a movement for the renewal of human dignity. Omniscient and omnipotent God stands behind this movement". <ref>Phayer, Michael. 2000. The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930–1965. Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, pg. 35</ref> Bishop Šarić also appropriated Jewish property for his own use. <ref>Phayer, Michael. 2000. The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930–1965. Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, pg.30</ref> . 

[[Pope Pius XII]] protected [[Ante Pavelić]] after World War II, gave him "refuge in the Vatican properties in Rome",  and assisted in his flight to South America; Pavelić and Pius XII shared the goal of a Catholic state in the Balkans and were unified in their opposition to the rising Communist state under Tito. <ref>Phayer, Michael. 2000. The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930–1965. Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, pg. 220</ref> Pius XII also believed that Pavelić and other war criminals could not get a fair trial in Yugoslavia. <ref>Phayer, Michael. 2000. The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930–1965. Indianapolis: Indiana University Press., pg. 226</ref> After arriving in Rome in 1946, Pavelić used the [[ratlines (history)|Vatican "ratline"]] to reach Argentina in 1948, along with other Ustaša,<ref>Phayer, Michael. 2000. The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930–1965. Indianapolis: Indiana University Press., pg. 220</ref>  Russian, Yugoslav, Italian, and American spies and agents all tried to apprehend Pavelić in Rome but the Vatican refused all cooperation and vigorously defended its extraterritorial status. <ref>Phayer, Michael. 2000. The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930–1965. Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, pg. 221</ref> Pavelić was never captured or tried for his crimes. <ref>Phayer, Michael. 2000. The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930–1965. Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, pg.220</ref> . 

According to Michael Phayer, "the Vatican's motivation for harboring Pavelić grew in lockstep with its apprehension about Tito's treatment of the church". <ref>Phayer, Michael. 2000. The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930–1965. Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, pg. 222</ref> . 

===Russia and Eastern Europe===. 
After the end of [[communism]] in Russia, the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] experienced a resurgence. The recent expansion of the Catholic population in Russia strained the Catholic-Russian Orthodox relationship. Orthodox [[Patriarch]] [[Patriarch Alexei II|Alexei II of Moscow]] has demanded that the Vatican curb "proselytism" by Catholic clerics in Russia and eastern Europe. <ref name=patriarch>[http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=52823 End Catholic "proselytism," Russian Patriarch demands]</ref> Catholic officials have replied that their efforts in Russia were not aimed at Orthodox believers, but were reaching out to the vast majority of Russians who are not churchgoers. <ref name=patriarch /> . 

According to a Catholic Church [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|CDF]] document called "[http://www.catholic-ew.org.uk/PDF%27s/evangelisation_note_english_141207.pdf Doctrinal Note on some aspects of evangelization]", the Church does not see that as proselytism but rather as evangelism, although it's converting [[Orthodox Christian]]s (at least nominally) to Catholicism. <ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Roman Catholic-Eastern Orthodox Dialogue | work = | publisher =Public Broadcasting Service | date =2000-07-14 | url =http://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week346/feature.html | doi = | accessdate =2008-02-16 }}</ref> . 

===Sexual abuse controversy===. 
{{Main|Catholic sex abuse cases}}
{{See also|Roman Catholic sex abuse cases by country}} . 

In January 2002, allegations of priests [[sexual abuse|sexually abusing children]] were widely reported in the news media. It became clear that the officials of various Catholic dioceses were aware of some of the abusive priests, and shuffled them from parish to parish (sometimes after [[psychotherapy]]), in some cases without removing them from contact with children. A survey of the 10 largest U.S. dioceses found 234 priests from a total 25,616 in those dioceses, have had allegations of sexual abuse made against them in the last 50 years. The report does not state how many of these have been proven in court. <ref>Grossman, Cathy Lynn. [http://www.bishop-accountability.org/usccb/natureandscope/general/2004-02-10-Grossman-SurveyMore.htm "Survey: More clergy abuse cases than previously thought."] ''USA Today'' (February 10, 2004). Retrieved July 21, 2007. </ref> . 

Some of these reassignments were egregious, the worst leading to the resignation of [[Cardinal Bernard Law]] from the [[Boston]] [[Diocese|archdiocese]]. Victims of such abuse filed lawsuits against a number of dioceses, resulting in [[Settlements and bankruptcies in Catholic sex abuse cases|multi-million dollar settlements]] in some cases. Similar allegations of abuse in Ireland led to the publication of the [[Ferns report]] in 2005, which stated that appropriate action was not taken in response to the allegations.  . 

In response, in June 2002, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops initiated strict new guidelines ("zero tolerance") for the protection of children and youth in Catholic institutions across the country. The [[Instruction Concerning the Criteria for the Discernment of Vocations with regard to Persons with Homosexual Tendencies in view of their Admission to the Seminary and to Holy Orders|Vatican revisited]] the issue of [[homosexuality]] and a gay subculture within the clergy, because the vast majority of the cases consisted of males preying on male adolescents (over 90% of the sexual abuse victims were teenage boys rather than girls or prepubescents). <ref>{{cite web|url=http://critiqueonline.org/?p=91 |title=Stories of grieves on precious pearls! « Critique Online |publisher=Critiqueonline.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-13}}</ref> .
