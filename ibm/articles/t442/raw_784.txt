'''Pope John Paul II''' ({{lang-la|Ioannes Paulus PP. II}}, {{lang-it|Giovanni Paolo II}}, {{lang-pl|Jan Paweł II}}), born '''Karol Józef Wojtyła''' ({{IPA-pl|ˈkarɔl ˈjuzɛf vɔjˈtɨwa|lang}};) (18 May 1920 – 2 April 2005), reigned as [[Pope]] of the [[Catholic Church]] from 1978 until his death in 2005. He was the [[Pope#Longest-reigning_popes|second-longest]] serving Pope in history and the first non-Italian since 1523.  . 

John Paul II was acclaimed as one of the most influential leaders of the 20th century. Some say{{who|date=March 2012}} he was [[#Role in the fall of Communism|instrumental in ending communist party control]] of his native Poland and eventually all of Europe. Conversely, he denounced the excesses of capitalism. John Paul II significantly improved the Catholic Church's relations with [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], the [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Church]], and the [[Anglican Communion]]. Though criticised by progressives for upholding the Church's teachings against artificial [[Birth control|contraception]] and the [[ordination of women]], and by traditionalists for his support of the Church's [[Second Vatican Council]] and its reform, he was also widely praised for his firm, orthodox Catholic stances.  . 

He was one of the most-travelled world leaders in history, visiting 129&nbsp;countries during his pontificate. As part of his special emphasis on the [[universal call to holiness]], he [[List of people beatified by Pope John Paul II|beatified 1,340&nbsp;people]] and [[canonisation|canonised]] 483&nbsp;[[saint]]s, more than the combined tally of his predecessors during the preceding five centuries. He named most of the present College of Cardinals, consecrated or co-consecrated an extremely large number of the world's past and current bishops, and ordained many priests. <ref>http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bwojtyla.html</ref> A key goal of his papacy was to transform and reposition the Catholic Church. His wish was "to place his Church at the heart of a new religious alliance that would bring together [[Abrahamic religions|Jews, Muslims and Christians]] in a great [religious] armada". <ref>[[Cristina Odone|Odone, Cristina]] – [[Catholic Herald]], 1991</ref><ref name="JewishTelegraph">[[Uri Geller|Geller, Uri]] – [[Jewish Telegraph|The Jewish Telegraph]], 7 July 2000</ref> 19&nbsp;December&nbsp;2009, John Paul&nbsp;II was proclaimed [[venerable]] by his successor [[Pope Benedict XVI|Pope Benedict&nbsp;XVI]] and was [[beatified]] on 1&nbsp;May&nbsp;2011.  .

Karol Józef Wojtyła ([[Anglicisation|Anglicised]]: ''Charles Joseph Wojtyla'') was born in the Polish town of [[Wadowice]]<ref name="A&E"/><ref name="ShortBio"/> and was the youngest of three children of Karol Wojtyła, an [[Poles|ethnic Pole]],<ref name="CNN6"/> and Emilia Kaczorowska, who is described as being of Lithuanian <ref name="CNN6"/> and possibly [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] ancestry. <ref name="Ancestry">{{cite web |url= http://www.catholic.org/pope/jp2/genealogy.php |title=Family Genealogy of Blessed Pope John Paul II|first= |last=Catholic Online  |work=catholic.org |year=2012 [last update] |quote=Family Genealogy of Blessed Pope John Paul II |accessdate=3 February 2012}}</ref> Emilia died on 13 April 1929,<ref name="CBN"/> when Wojtyła was eight years old.{{sfn|Stourton|2006|p=11}} His elder sister Olga had died before his birth, but he was close to his brother Edmund, nicknamed ''Mundek,'' who was 14 years his senior. Edmund's work as a physician eventually led to his death from [[scarlet fever]], which affected Wojtyła. <ref name="CNN6"/>{{sfn|Stourton|2006|p=11}} . 

As a boy, Wojtyła was athletic, often playing [[association football|football]] as [[goalkeeper]].{{sfn|Stourton|2006|p=25}} During his childhood, Wojtyła had contact with Wadowice's large Jewish community. School football games were often organised between teams of Jews and Catholics, and Wojtyła often played on the Jewish side. <ref name="CNN6"/>{{sfn|Stourton|2006|p=25}} "I remember that at least a third of my classmates at elementary school in [[Wadowice]] were Jews. At elementary school there were fewer. With some I was on very friendly terms. And what struck me about some of them was their Polish patriotism." {{sfn|Pope John Paul II|2005|p=99}}  Wojtyła’s first, and possibly only, love affair was with a Jewish girl, [[Ginka Beer]], who was described as "slender", "a superb actress" and "having stupendous dark eyes and jet black hair". <ref name="JewishTelegraph"/> On 13 April 1929, Wojtyla's mother died in childbirth. <ref name="Ancestry"/>  . 

In mid-1938, Wojtyła and his father left Wadowice and moved to [[Kraków]], where he enrolled at [[Jagiellonian University]]. While studying such topics as [[philology]] and various languages, he worked as a volunteer librarian and was required to participate in [[Conscription|compulsory military training]] in the [[36th Infantry Regiment (Poland)|Academic Legion]], but he [[Pacifism|refused to fire a weapon]]. He performed with various theatrical groups and worked as a [[playwright]]. <ref name="Kuhiwczak"/> During this time, his talent for language blossomed, and he learned as many as 12 foreign languages, nine of which he used extensively as Pope. <ref name="A&E"/> . 

In 1939, [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupation forces]] closed the university after invading Poland. <ref name="A&E"/> Able-bodied males were required to work, so from 1940 to 1944 Wojtyła variously worked as a messenger for a restaurant, a manual labourer in a limestone quarry and for the [[Solvay (company)|Solvay]] chemical factory, to avoid deportation to Germany. <ref name="ShortBio"/><ref name="Kuhiwczak"/> His father, a [[non-commissioned officer]] in the [[Polish Land Forces|Polish Army]], died of a heart attack in 1941,<ref name="Ancestry"/>  leaving Wojtyła as the immediate family's only surviving member. <ref name="CNN6"/><ref name="CBN"/>{{sfn|Stourton|2006|p=60}} "I was not at my mother's death, I was not at my brother's death, I was not at my father's death," he said, reflecting on these times of his life, nearly forty years later, "At twenty, I had already lost all the people I loved."{{sfn|Stourton|2006|p=60}} . 

After his father's death, he started thinking seriously about the priesthood.{{sfn|Stourton|2006|p=63}} In October 1942, while the war continued, he knocked on the door of the [[Archbishop]]'s Palace in [[Kraków]] and asked to study for the priesthood.{{sfn|Stourton|2006|p=63}} Soon after, he began courses in the [[Education in Poland during World War II|clandestine underground seminary]] run by the [[Archbishop of Kraków]], [[Adam Stefan Sapieha|Adam Stefan Cardinal Sapieha]]. 
On 29 February 1944, Wojtyła was knocked down by a [[Nazi Germany|German]] truck. German [[Wehrmacht]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] tended to him and sent him to a hospital. He spent two weeks there recovering from a severe [[concussion]] and a shoulder injury. It seemed to him that this accident and his survival was confirmation of his vocation. On 6&nbsp;August&nbsp;1944, ‘Black Sunday’,{{sfn|Weigel|2001|p=71}} the [[Gestapo]] rounded up young men in Kraków to avoid an [[Krakow Uprising (1944)|uprising]] similar{{sfn|Weigel|2001|p=71}} to the recent [[Warsaw Uprising|uprising in Warsaw]].{{sfn|Davies|2004|pp=253–254}}{{sfn|Weigel|2001|pp=71–21}} Wojtyła escaped by hiding in the basement of his uncle's house at 10 Tyniecka Street, while the German troops searched above.{{sfn|Stourton|2006|p=63}}{{sfn|Davies|2004|pp=253–254}}{{sfn|Weigel|2001|pp=71–21}} More than eight thousand men and boys were taken that day, while Wojtyła escaped to the Archbishop's Palace,{{sfn|Stourton|2006|p=63}}{{sfn|Weigel|2001|p=71}}{{sfn|Davies|2004|pp=253–254}} where he remained until after the Germans had left. <ref name="CNN6"/>{{sfn|Stourton|2006|p=63}}{{sfn|Davies|2004|pp=253–254}} . 

On the night of 17&nbsp;January&nbsp;1945, [[Vistula–Oder Offensive|the Germans fled the city]], and the students reclaimed the ruined [[seminary]]. Wojtyła and another seminarian volunteered for the task of clearing away piles of frozen excrement from the toilets.{{sfn|Weigel|2001|p=75}} Wojtyła also helped a 14-year-old Jewish refugee girl named [[Edith Zierer]],<ref name="EdithZ"/> who had run away from a Nazi [[labour camp]] in [[Częstochowa]]. <ref name="EdithZ"/> Edith had collapsed on a railway platform, so Wojtyła carried her to a train and stayed with her throughout the journey to Kraków. Edith credits Wojtyła with saving her life that day. <ref name="CNNLive"/><ref name="archive"/><ref name="IHT"/> [[B'nai B'rith]] and other authorities have said that Wojtyła helped protect many other [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]] from the Nazis. In Wojtyła's last book ''[[Memory and Identity]]'' he described the 12 years of the Nazi régime as '[[bestiality]]',{{sfn|Pope John Paul II|2005|p=16}} quoting from Polish theologian and philosopher [[Konstanty Michalski]]. <ref>''Między Heroizmem a Beatialstwem'' (Between Heroism and Bestiality), Częstochowa, 1984</ref> . 

===Priesthood===. 
On finishing his studies at the seminary in Kraków, Wojtyła was [[ordination|ordained]] as a priest on [[All Saints|All Saints' Day]], 1 November 1946,<ref name="CBN"/> by the Archbishop of [[Kraków]], [[Adam Stefan Sapieha|Cardinal Sapieha]]. <ref name="ShortBio"/>{{sfn|Stourton|2006|p=71}}<ref name="Vatican2"/> He then studied [[theology]] in Rome, at the [[Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum)|Pontifical International Athenaeum ''Angelicum'']],{{sfn|Stourton|2006|p=71}}<ref name="Vatican2"/> where he earned a [[Licentiate of Sacred Theology|licentiate]] and later a [[Doctor of Sacred Theology|doctorate in sacred theology]]. <ref name="A&E"/> This doctorate, the first of two, was based on the Latin dissertation ''The Doctrine of Faith According to Saint John of the Cross''.  . 

He returned to Poland in the summer of 1948 with his first [[pastoral]] assignment in the village of [[Niegowić]], fifteen miles from Kraków. He arrived at Niegowić at harvest time, where his first action was to kneel and kiss the ground.{{sfn|Maxwell-Stuart|2006|p=233}} This gesture, which he adapted from French saint [[John Vianney|Jean Marie Baptiste Vianney]],{{sfn|Maxwell-Stuart|2006|p=233}} would become a ‘trademark’ action during his Papacy. 
[[File:Facade of the main entrance of the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum) (19May07).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum)|Pontifical International Athenaeum ''Angelicum'']] in Rome]]
In March 1949, Wojtyła was transferred to the parish of [[Saint Florian]] in Kraków. He taught [[ethics]] at [[Jagiellonian University]] and subsequently at the [[John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin|Catholic University of Lublin]]. While teaching, he gathered a group of about 20&nbsp;young people, who began to call themselves ''Rodzinka'', the "little family". They met for prayer, philosophical discussion, and to help the blind and sick. The group eventually grew to approximately 200&nbsp;participants, and their activities expanded to include annual [[skiing]] and [[kayak]]ing trips. <ref name="USCCB_Bio"/> . 

In 1954, he earned a second doctorate, in philosophy,{{sfn|Stourton|2006|p=97}} evaluating the feasibility of a Catholic ethic based on the ethical system of [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]] [[Max Scheler]], a German philosopher who founded a broad [[philosophical movement]] which emphasised the study of conscious  experience. However, the Communist authorities intervened to prevent him from receiving the degree until 1957. <ref name="Vatican2"/> Wojtyła developed a theological approach which combined traditional Catholic [[Thomism]] with the ideas of [[personalism]], a philosophical approach deriving from [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], which was popular amongst Catholic intellectuals in Kraków during Wojtyła's intellectual development. He translated Scheler's ''Formalism and the Ethics of Substantive Values''. <ref>{{cite book|last=Walsh|first=Michael|title=John Paul II: A Biography|year=1994|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|isbn=0002159937|pages=20–21}}</ref>  . 

During this period, Wojtyła wrote a series of articles in Kraków's Catholic newspaper ''[[Tygodnik Powszechny]]'' ("''Universal Weekly''") dealing with contemporary church issues. <ref name="Zenit5"/> He focused on creating original [[Literature|literary work]] during his first dozen years as a priest. War, life under Communism, and his pastoral responsibilities all fed his poetry and plays. Wojtyła published his work under two pseudonyms – ''Andrzej Jawień'' and ''Stanisław Andrzej Gruda''<ref name="Kuhiwczak"/><ref name="Zenit5"/> – to distinguish his literary from his religious writings, (under his own name) and also so that his literary works would be considered on their merits. <ref name="Kuhiwczak"/><ref name="Zenit5"/> In 1960, Wojtyła published the influential theological book ''[[Love and Responsibility]]'', a defence of traditional Church teachings on marriage from a new philosophical standpoint. <ref name="Kuhiwczak"/>{{sfn|Wojtyła|1981}} . 

===Bishop and cardinal===. 
On 4 July 1958,<ref name="Vatican2"/> while Wojtyła was on a kayaking holiday in the lakes region of northern Poland, [[Pope Pius XII]] appointed him as the [[auxiliary bishop]] of Kraków. He was then summoned to Warsaw to meet the [[Primate (religion)|Primate]] of Poland, [[Stefan Wyszyński|Stefan Cardinal Wyszyński]], who informed him of his appointment. <ref name="Rise"/>{{sfn|Stourton|2006|p=103}} He agreed to serve as Auxiliary Bishop to Kraków's [[Archbishop]] [[Eugeniusz Baziak]], and he was ordained to the Episcopate (as Titular Bishop of [[Ombi]]) on 28 September 1958. Baziak was the principal consecrator. Then-Auxiliary Bishop [[Boleslaw Kominek]] (Titular Bishop of [[Sophene]] and [[Vågå|Vaga]]; of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Wroclaw and future Cardinal Archbishop of Wroclaw) and then-Auxiliary Bishop [[Franciszek Jop]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sandomierz]] (Titular Bishop of [[Daulia]]; later Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Wroclaw and then Bishop of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Opole]]) were the principal co-consecrators. <ref name="Vatican2"/> At the age of 38, Wojtyła became the youngest bishop in Poland. Baziak died in June 1962 and on 16 July Wojtyła was selected as ''Vicar Capitular'' ''(temporary administrator)'' of the Archdiocese until an Archbishop could be appointed. <ref name="A&E"/><ref name="ShortBio"/> . 

In October 1962, Wojtyła took part in the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962–1965),<ref name="A&E"/><ref name="Vatican2"/> where he made contributions to two of its most historic and influential products, the ''Decree on Religious Freedom'' (in Latin, ''[[Dignitatis Humanae]]'') and the ''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World'' (''[[Gaudium et Spes]]''). <ref name="Vatican2"/> Wojtyła and the Polish bishops contributed a draft text to the Council for ''Gaudium et Spes''. According to the historian John W. O'Malley, the draft text ''Gaudium et Spes'' which Wojtyła and the Polish delegation sent "had some influence on the version that was sent to the council fathers that summer but was not accepted as the base text". <ref>{{cite book|last=O'Malley|first=John W.|title=What Happened at Vatican II|year=2008|publisher=Harvard University press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780674031692|pages=204–205}}</ref> According to John F. Crosby, as Pope, John Paul II used the words of ''Gaudium et Spes'' later to introduce his own views on the nature of the human person in relation to God: man is "the only creature on earth that God has wanted for its own sake", but man "can fully discover his true self only in a sincere giving of himself". <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Crosby|first1=John F.|year=2000|title=John Paul II's Vision of Sexuality and Marriage: The Mystery of "Fair Love"|journal=The Legacy of Pope John Paul II: His Contribution to Catholic Thought|page=54|publisher=Crossroad|isbn=0824518314|accessdate=25 January 2012|editor1-last=Gneuhs|editor1-first=Geoffrey}}</ref> . 

He also participated in the assemblies of the [[Synod|Synod of Bishops]]. <ref name="A&E"/><ref name="ShortBio"/> On 13 January 1964, [[Pope Paul VI]] appointed him [[Archbishop]] of [[Kraków]]. <ref name="VaticanNewsService"/> On 26 June 1967, Paul VI announced Archbishop Karol Wojtyła's promotion to the [[College of Cardinals|Sacred College of Cardinals]]. <ref name="Vatican2"/><ref name="VaticanNewsService"/> Wojtyła was named [[Cardinal-Priest]] of the [[Titular church|titulus]] of [[San Cesareo in Palatio]].  . 

In 1967, he was instrumental in formulating the [[encyclical]] ''[[Humanae Vitae]]'', which dealt with the same issues that forbid [[abortion]] and [[birth control|artificial birth control]]. <ref name="Vatican2"/><ref name="Memory"/><ref name="HV"/><!-- In 1970, according to a contemporary witness, Cardinal Wojtyła was against the distribution of a letter around Krakow, stating that the Polish Episcopate was preparing for the 50th anniversary of the [[Polish-Soviet War]]. <ref name="powszechnego"/>would someone like to expand on this – removing for now--> . 

===Election to the papacy===. 
{{main|Papal conclave, October 1978}}
[[File:Habemus papam io paulus II.jpg|thumb|The newly elected Pope John Paul&nbsp;II stands on the balcony]]
<!--[[File:John paul 2 coa.svg|thumb|130|[[Coat of arms|Coat of Arms]] of Pope John Paul II with the ''[[Marian Cross]]''. The Letter M is for [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Mary]], the mother of Jesus, to whom he held strong devotion]]--> . 

In August 1978, following the death of [[Pope Paul VI]], Cardinal Wojtyła voted in the [[Papal conclave, August 1978|Papal conclave]] which elected [[Pope John Paul I]], who at 65 was considered young by papal standards. John Paul I died after only 33 days as Pope, triggering another conclave. <ref name="ShortBio"/><ref name="Vatican2"/><ref name="Time1978"/> . 

The second conclave of 1978 started on 14 October, ten days after the funeral. It was split between two strong [[Papabile|candidates for the papacy]]: [[Giuseppe Siri|Giuseppe Cardinal Siri]], the conservative [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Genoa|Archbishop of Genoa]], and the [[liberalism|liberal]] [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Florence|Archbishop of Florence]], [[Giovanni Benelli|Giovanni Cardinal Benelli]], a close friend of John Paul I. <ref name="Time1978b"/> . 

Supporters of Benelli were confident that he would be elected, and in early [[ballot]]s, Benelli came within nine votes of success. <ref name="Time1978b"/> However, both men faced sufficient opposition that neither was likely to prevail. [[Franz König|Franz Cardinal König]], [[Archbishop of Vienna]] suggested to his fellow electors a compromise candidate: the Polish [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]], Karol Józef Wojtyła. <ref name="Time1978b"/> Wojtyła won on the eighth ballot on the second day with, according to the Italian press, 99 votes from the 111 participating electors. He subsequently chose the name John Paul II<ref name="Vatican2"/><ref name="Time1978b"/> in honour of his immediate predecessor, and the traditional white smoke informed the crowd gathered in St. Peter's Square that a pope had been chosen. <ref name="Time1978"/> He accepted his election with these words: ‘With obedience in faith to Christ, my Lord, and with trust in the Mother of Christ and the Church, in spite of great difficulties, I accept.’{{sfn|Stourton|2006|p=171}}<ref name="NewPope"/> When the new pontiff appeared on the balcony, he broke tradition by addressing the gathered crowd:{{sfn|Stourton|2006|p=171}} . 

<blockquote>Dear brothers and sisters, we are saddened at the death of our beloved Pope John Paul I, and so the cardinals have called for a new bishop of Rome. They called him from a faraway land – far and yet always close because of our communion in faith and Christian traditions. I was afraid to accept that responsibility, yet I do so in a spirit of obedience to the Lord and total faithfulness to Mary, our most Holy Mother. I am speaking to you in your – no, our Italian language. If I make a mistake, please ''‘kirrect’'' {{sic}} me...{{sfn|Stourton|2006|p=171}}<ref name="Bottum"/><!---note. intentional mispronunciation in Italian inserted as bad English here to convey his joke---></blockquote>
Wojtyła became the 264th Pope according to the chronological [[list of popes]], the first non-Italian in 455 years. <ref name="upi"/> At only 58 years of age, he was the youngest pope since [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1846, who was 54. <ref name="Vatican2"/> Like his predecessor, Pope John Paul&nbsp;II dispensed with the traditional [[Papal Coronation|Papal coronation]] and instead received ecclesiastical [[investiture]] with the simplified [[Papal Inauguration|Papal inauguration]] on 22 October 1978. During his inauguration, when the cardinals were to kneel before him to take their vows and kiss his ring, he stood up as the Polish prelate [[Stefan Wyszyński|Stefan Cardinal Wyszyński]] knelt down, stopped him from kissing the ring, and simply hugged him. <ref name="Vatican-bio-en"/> . 

===Pastoral trips===.

During his pontificate, Pope John Paul II made trips to 129 countries,{{sfn|Maxwell-Stuart|2006|p=234}} travelling more than {{convert|1100000|km}} whilst doing so. He consistently attracted large crowds, some amongst the largest ever assembled in [[history of the world|human history]], such as the [[World Youth Day 1995|Manila World Youth Day]], which gathered up to 4 million people, the largest Papal gathering ever, according to the Vatican. <ref name=BaltimoreSun>{{cite web |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-01-16/news/1995016078_1_pope-philippines-papal |title=Biggest Papal Gathering &#124; Millions Flock to Papal Mass in Manila, Gathering is Called the Largest the Pope Has Seen at a Service - Baltimore Sun |first=|last=New York Times News Service|work=articles.baltimoresun.com |year=2012 [last update] |accessdate=29 January 2012}}</ref><ref name="AsiaNews"/> . 

John Paul II's earliest official visits were to the Dominican Republic and Mexico in January 1979 and to Poland in June 1979,<ref name="CBN2"/> where ecstatic crowds constantly surrounded him. <ref name="OnThisDay"/> This first trip to Poland uplifted the nation's spirit and sparked the formation of the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement in 1980, which later brought freedom and [[human rights]] to his troubled homeland. <ref name="Memory"/> On later trips to Poland, he gave tacit support to the organisation. <ref name="Memory"/> Successive Polish trips reinforced this message and contributed to the collapse of East European Communism that took place between 1989/1990 with the reintroduction of democracy in Poland, and which then spread through Eastern Europe (1990–1991) and South-Eastern Europe (1990–1992). <ref name="Bottum"/>{{sfn|Maxwell-Stuart|2006|p=234}}<ref name="OnThisDay"/><ref name="CBCNews"/><ref name="Gorbachev"/> . 

While some of his trips (such as to the United States and the [[Holy Land]]) were to places previously visited by [[Pope Paul VI]], John Paul II became the first pope to visit the [[White House]] in October 1979, where he was [[List of meetings between the President of the United States and the Pope|greeted warmly]] by then-President [[Jimmy Carter]]. He was the first Pope ever to visit several countries, starting in 1979 with Mexico<ref name="Mexico"/> and Ireland. <ref name="Ireland"/> He was the first reigning pope to [[Pope John Paul II's visit to the United Kingdom|travel to the United Kingdom]], in 1982, where he met [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;II]], the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Governor]] of the [[Church of England]]. He travelled to Haiti in 1983, where he spoke in [[Creole language|Creole]] to thousands of impoverished Catholics gathered to greet him at the airport. His message, "things must change in Haiti", referring to the disparity between the wealthy and the poor, was met with thunderous applause. <ref name="Haiti: The Duvalier Years"/> In 2000, he was the first modern pope to visit Egypt,<ref name="PopeEgypt"/> where he met with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic pope]], [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria|Pope Shenouda&nbsp;III]]<ref name="PopeEgypt"/> and the [[List of Greek Orthodox Patriarchs of Alexandria|Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria]]. <ref name="PopeEgypt"/> He was the first Catholic pope to visit and pray in an [[Islam]]ic mosque, in [[Damascus]], Syria, in 2001. He visited the [[Umayyad Mosque]], a former [[Christian Church|Christian church]] where [[John the Baptist]] is believed to be interred,<ref name="Mosque"/> where he made a speech calling for Muslims, Christians and Jews to live together. <ref name="Mosque"/> .

==Teachings==. 
{{see also|List of encyclicals of Pope John Paul II}} 
As pope, John Paul II wrote [[List of encyclicals of Pope John Paul II|14 papal encyclicals]] and taught about "The Theology of the Body". Some key elements of his strategy to "reposition the Catholic Church" were encyclicals such as ''[[Ecclesia de Eucharistia]]'', ''[[Reconciliatio et Paenitentia]]'' and ''[[Redemptoris Mater]]''. In his ''At the beginning of the new millennium'' (''[[Novo Millennio Ineunte]]''), he emphasised the importance of "starting afresh from [[Christ]]": "No, we shall not be saved by a formula but by a Person." In ''The Splendour of the Truth'' (''[[Veritatis Splendor]]''), he emphasised the dependence of man on God and His Law ("Without the Creator, the creature disappears") and the "dependence of freedom on the truth". He warned that man "giving himself over to [[relativism]] and [[skepticism|scepticism]], goes off in search of an illusory freedom apart from truth itself". In ''[[Fides et Ratio]]'' (''On the Relationship between Faith and Reason'') John Paul promoted a renewed interest in philosophy and an autonomous pursuit of truth in theological matters. Drawing on many different sources (such as [[Thomism]]), he described the mutually supporting relationship between [[faith and rationality|faith and reason]], and emphasised that theologians should focus on that relationship. John Paul II wrote extensively about workers and the [[Catholic social teaching|social doctrine]] of the Church, which he discussed in three encyclicals. Through his encyclicals and many [[General epistles|Apostolic Letters]] and Exhortations, John Paul II talked about the [[dignity]] of women and the importance of the family for the future of humanity. <ref name="Memory"/> Other [[encyclical]]s include ''The Gospel of Life'' (''[[Evangelium Vitae]]'') and ''Ut Unum Sint'' (''That They May Be One''). Though critics accused him of inflexibility, he explicitly re-asserted Catholic moral teachings against [[Catholic Church and capital punishment|capital punishment]], [[euthanasia]] and [[Catholic Church and abortion|abortion]] that have been in place for well over a thousand years. <ref name="Memory"/> . 

===Social and political stances===. 
{{main|Social and political stances of Pope John Paul II}}
John Paul II was considered a conservative on [[doctrine]], and issues relating to [[sexual reproduction]] and the [[ordination]] of women. <ref name="Spiegel2"/> . 

While the Pope was visiting the United States of America he said, "All human life, from the moments of conception and through all subsequent stages, is sacred."<ref name="Pope John Paul II Visits the U.S., 1977 Year in Review."/> . 

A series of 129 lectures given by John Paul II during his Wednesday audiences in Rome between September 1979 and November 1984 were later compiled and published as a single work entitled ''‘[[Theology of the Body]]’'', an extended meditation on [[human sexuality]]. He extended it to the condemnation of [[abortion]], [[euthanasia]] and virtually all [[capital punishment]],<ref name="pbs"/> calling them all a part of the "[[culture of life|culture of death]]" that is pervasive in the modern world. He campaigned for world [[debt relief|debt forgiveness]] and [[social justice]]. <ref name="Memory"/><ref name="Spiegel2"/> In 2000, he publicly endorsed the [[Jubilee 2000]] campaign on African [[debt relief]] fronted by Irish rock stars [[Bob Geldof]] and [[Bono]], once famously interrupting a [[U2]] recording session by telephoning the studio and asking to speak to Bono. <ref name="Pope phones Bono"/> . 

Pope John Paul II, who was present and very influential at the [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]] (1962–65), affirmed the teachings of that Council and did much to implement them. Nevertheless, his critics often wished that he would embrace the so-called "progressive" agenda that some hoped would evolve as a result of the Council. In fact, the Council did not advocate "progressive" changes in these areas; for example, they still condemned abortion as an unspeakable crime. Pope John Paul II continued to declare that [[Birth control|contraception]], [[abortion]], and [[Homosexuality|homosexual acts]] were gravely sinful, and, with [[Pope Benedict XVI|Joseph Ratzinger]] (future Pope Benedict XVI), opposed [[Liberation theology]].  . 

Following the Church's exaltation of the marital act of sexual intercourse between a baptised man and woman within sacramental marriage as proper and exclusive to the [[sacrament]] of marriage, John Paul II believed that it was, in every instance, profaned by contraception, abortion, divorce followed by a 'second' marriage, and by homosexual acts. His beliefs were often assumed to be a rejection of women. In 1994 John Paul II asserted the Church's lack of authority to ordain women to the priesthood, claiming that without such authority ordination is not legitimately compatible with fidelity to Christ. This was also deemed a repudiation of calls to break with the constant tradition of the Church by ordaining women to the priesthood. <ref name="VaticanOrdinatio"/> In addition, John Paul II chose not to end the discipline of mandatory priestly [[celibacy]], although in a small number of unusual circumstances, he did allow certain married clergymen of other Christian traditions who later became Catholic to be ordained as Catholic priests.  . 

===Evolution===. 
{{See also|Catholic Church and evolution|Social and political stances of Pope John Paul II#Scientific theories and the interpretation of Genesis|l3=Scientific theories and the interpretation of Genesis}}
On 22 October 1996, in a speech to the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]] [[plenary session]] at the Vatican, Pope John Paul&nbsp;II said of evolution that "this theory has been progressively accepted by researchers, following a series of discoveries in various fields of knowledge. The convergence, neither sought nor fabricated, of the results of work that was conducted independently is in itself a significant argument in favour of this theory." The Pope qualified this by noting that, "rather than the theory of evolution, we should speak of several theories of evolution." Some of these theories, he noted, have a purely materialistic philosophical underpinning which is not compatible with the Catholic faith: "Consequently, theories of evolution which, in accordance with the philosophies inspiring them, consider the mind as emerging from the forces of living matter, or as a mere epiphenomenon of this matter, are incompatible with the truth about man". <ref name="Evolution"/><ref name="Linder"/><ref name="NCSE"/><ref name="Tagliabue"/> . 

Although generally accepting the theory of evolution, John Paul II made one major exception – the [[Soul (spirit)|human soul]]. "If the human body has its origin in living material which pre-exists it, the spiritual soul is immediately created by God". <ref name="Evolution"/><ref name="NCSE"/><ref name="Tagliabue"/> . 

===Liberation theology===. 
In 1984 and 1986, through [[Pope Benedict XVI|Cardinal Ratzinger]] (now Pope Benedict XVI), then-leader of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], John Paul II officially condemned aspects of [[Liberation theology]], which had many followers in South America. Visiting Europe, [[Óscar Romero]] unsuccessfully attempted to obtain a Vatican condemnation of [[El Salvador]]'s regime, for violations of human rights and its support of [[death squad]]s. In his travel to [[Managua]], Nicaragua in 1983, John Paul II harshly condemned what he dubbed the "popular Church"<ref name="Miami"/> (i.e. "[[basic ecclesial community|ecclesial base communities]]" supported by the [[Latin American Episcopal Conference|CELAM]]), and the Nicaraguan clergy's tendencies to support the leftist [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinistas]], reminding the clergy of their duties of obedience to the [[Holy See]]. <ref name="Miami"/> During that visit [[Ernesto Cardenal]], a priest and minister in the Sandinista government, knelt to kiss his hand. John Paul withdrew it, wagged his finger in Cardenal's face, and told him, "You must straighten out your position with the church."<ref name="Religion: Berating Marxism's False Hopes"/> . 

===Views on sexuality===. 
{{see also|Homosexuality and Roman Catholicism|Theology of the Body}}
While taking a traditional position on [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], defending the Church's moral opposition to [[same-sex marriage|marriage for same-sex couples]], Pope John Paul&nbsp;II asserted that persons with homosexual inclinations possess the same inherent [[dignity]] and [[human rights|rights]] as everybody else. <ref name="Smith2010"/> In his book, ''[[Memory and Identity]]'', he referred to the "strong pressures" by the [[European Parliament]] to recognise homosexual unions as an alternative type of family, with the right to adopt children. In the book, as quoted by [[Reuters]], he wrote: "It is legitimate and necessary to ask oneself if this is not perhaps part of a new ideology of evil, more subtle and hidden, perhaps, intent upon exploiting human rights themselves against man and against the family{{sic}}."<ref name="Memory"/>{{sfn|Pope John Paul II|2005|p=12}} A 1997 study determined that 3% of the pope's statements were about the issue of sexual morality. <ref name="The Truth of Catholicism"/> . 

===Relations with other faiths===. 
Pope John Paul&nbsp;II travelled extensively and met with believers from many divergent faiths. At the [[Day of Prayer|World Day of Prayer for Peace]], held in [[Assisi]] on 27 October 1986, more than 120 representatives of different religions and [[Christian denomination]]s spent a day together with fasting and praying. <ref name="Pace preventiva"/> . 

====Anglicanism====. 
Pope John Paul&nbsp;II had good relations with the [[Church of England]], referred to by his predecessor [[Pope Paul VI]], as ''"our beloved Sister Church"''. <ref name="Kirby"/> He preached in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] during his visit to London, and received the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] with friendship and courtesy. However, John Paul&nbsp;II was disappointed by the Church of England's decision to offer the Sacrament of [[Holy Orders]] to women and saw it as a step in the opposite direction from unity between the [[Anglican Communion]] and the Catholic Church. <ref name="Kirby"/> . 

In 1980 John Paul II issued a [[Pastoral Provision]] allowing married former Episcopal priests to become Catholic priests, and for the acceptance of former [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] parishes into the Catholic Church. He allowed the creation of the [[Anglican Use]] form of the [[Latin Rite]], which incorporates the Anglican [[Book of Common Prayer]]. John Paul II helped establish '[[Our Lady of the Atonement Catholic Church]]', together with Archbishop [[Patrick Flores]] of [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]], as a place where Anglicans and Catholics could worship together. <ref name="Atonement"/> . 

====Buddhism====. 
[[14th Dalai Lama|Tenzin Gyatso]], the 14th [[Dalai Lama]] visited Pope John Paul&nbsp;II eight times, more than any other single dignitary. The Pope and the Dalai Lama held many similar views and understood similar plights, both coming from nations damaged by communism and both serving as heads of major religious bodies. <ref name="Dalai"/><ref name="Lama"/> . 

====Eastern Orthodox Church====. 
 {{main|Pope John Paul II's relations with the Eastern Orthodox Church}}
In May 1999, John Paul II visited [[Romania]] on the invitation from Patriarch [[Teoctist Arăpaşu]] of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]]. This was the first time a Pope had visited a predominantly Eastern Orthodox country since the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] in 1054. <ref name="Teoctist"/> On his arrival, the Patriarch and the [[President of Romania]], [[Emil Constantinescu]], greeted the Pope. <ref name="Teoctist"/> The Patriarch stated, "The second millennium of Christian history began with a painful wounding of the unity of the Church; the end of this millennium has seen a real commitment to restoring Christian unity."<ref name="Teoctist"/> . 

On 23–27 June 2001 John Paul&nbsp;II visited Ukraine, another heavily Orthodox nation, at the invitation of the [[President of Ukraine]] and bishops of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. <ref name="Ukraine"/> The Pope spoke to leaders of the All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organisations, pleading for "open, tolerant and honest dialogue". <ref name="Ukraine"/> About 200 thousand people attended the liturgies celebrated by the Pope in [[Kiev]], and the liturgy in [[Lviv]] gathered nearly one and a half million faithful. <ref name="Ukraine"/> John Paul&nbsp;II stated that an end to the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] was one of his fondest wishes. <ref name="Ukraine"/> Healing divisions between the Catholic and [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox churches]] regarding Latin and [[Byzantine]] traditions was clearly of great personal interest. For many years, John Paul II sought to facilitate dialogue and unity stating as early as 1988 in ''Euntes in mundum'' that "Europe has two lungs, it will never breathe easily until it uses both of them".  . 

During his 2001 travels, John Paul&nbsp;II became the first Pope to visit Greece in 1291 years. <ref name="Macedonian"/><ref name="Associated"/> In [[Athens]], the Pope met with [[Archbishop Christodoulos of Athens|Archbishop Christodoulos]], the head of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]]. <ref name="Macedonian"/> After a private 30 minute meeting, the two spoke publicly. Christodoulos read a list of "13 offences" of the Roman Catholic Church against the [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Church]] since the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]],<ref name="Macedonian"/> including the pillaging of [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|Constantinople by crusaders]] in 1204, and bemoaned the lack of apology from the Roman Catholic Church, saying "Until now, there has not been heard a single request for pardon" for the "maniacal crusaders of the 13th century."<ref name="Macedonian"/> . 

The Pope responded by saying "For the occasions past and present, when sons and daughters of the Catholic Church have sinned by action or omission against their Orthodox brothers and sisters, may the Lord grant us forgiveness," to which Christodoulos immediately applauded. John Paul&nbsp;II said that the sacking of Constantinople was a source of "profound regret" for Catholics. <ref name="Macedonian"/> Later John Paul II and Christodoulos met on a spot where [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] had once preached to Athenian Christians. They issued a ‘common declaration’, saying "We shall do everything in our power, so that the Christian roots of Europe and its Christian soul may be preserved. … We condemn all recourse to violence, proselytism and fanaticism, in the name of religion". <ref name="Macedonian"/> The two leaders then said the [[Lord's Prayer]] together, breaking an Orthodox taboo against praying with Catholics. <ref name="Macedonian"/> . 

The Pope had said throughout his pontificate that one of his greatest dreams was to visit Russia, but this never occurred. He attempted to solve the problems that had arisen over centuries between the Catholic and [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] churches, and in 2004 gave them a 1730 copy of the lost icon of [[Our Lady of Kazan]].  . 

====Islam====. 
Pope John Paul&nbsp;II made considerable efforts to improve relations between Catholicism and [[Islam]]. <ref name="Crossing the Threshold of Hope"/> . 

On 6&nbsp;May&nbsp;2001, Pope John Paul&nbsp;II became the first Catholic pope to enter and pray in a [[mosque]]. Respectfully removing his shoes, he entered the [[Umayyad Mosque]], a former [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine era]] Christian church dedicated to [[John the Baptist]] (who was believed to be interred there) in [[Damascus, Syria]], and gave a speech including the statement: "For all the times that Muslims and Christians have offended one another, we need to seek forgiveness from the Almighty and to offer each other forgiveness."<ref name="Mosque"/> He kissed the [[Qur'an|Qur’an]] in Syria,<ref name="Akin"/> an act which made him popular amongst Muslims but which disturbed many Catholics. <ref name="Akin"/> . 

In 2004, Pope John Paul&nbsp;II hosted the "Papal Concert of Reconciliation", which brought together leaders of [[Islam]] with leaders of the Jewish community and of the Catholic Church at the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]] for a concert by the Kraków Philharmonic Choir from Poland, the [[London Philharmonic Choir]] from the United Kingdom, the [[Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra]] from the United States, and the [[Ankara]] State Polyphonic Choir of [[Turkey]]. <ref name="WQED"/><ref name="Concert"/><ref name="Philharmonic"/><ref name="Gazette"/> The event was conceived and conducted by Sir [[Gilbert Levine]], [[Order of St. Gregory the Great|KCSG]] and was broadcast throughout the world. <ref name="WQED"/><ref name="Concert"/><ref name="Philharmonic"/><ref name="Gazette"/> . 

John Paul&nbsp;II oversaw the publication of the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] which makes a special provision{{clarify|date=November 2011}} for Muslims; therein, it is written, "The plan of salvation also includes those who acknowledge the [[Creator deity#Monotheism|Creator]], in 'the first place amongst whom are the Muslims'; these profess to hold the faith of [[Abraham]], and together with us they adore the one, merciful God, mankind's judge on the last day."<ref name="Catechism"/> . 

====Judaism====. 
[[Relations between Catholicism and Judaism]] improved during the pontificate of John Paul II. <ref name="Memory"/><ref name="ADL2006"/> He spoke frequently about the Church's relationship with the Jewish faith. <ref name="Memory"/> . 

In 1979, John Paul II became the first pope to visit the German [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in Poland, where many of his compatriots (mostly [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]]) had perished during the Nazi occupation in World War II. In 1998 he issued ''"We Remember: A Reflection on the Shoah"'' which outlined his thinking on the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. <ref name="Cassidy"/> He became the first pope known to have made an official papal visit to a synagogue, when he visited the [[Great Synagogue of Rome]] on 13 April 1986. <ref name="AIJAC"/><ref name="www"/> . 

In 1994, John Paul&nbsp;II established formal diplomatic relations between the Holy See and the [[Israel|State of Israel]], acknowledging its centrality in Jewish life and faith. <ref name="AIJAC"/> In honour of this event, Pope John Paul&nbsp;II hosted ''‘The Papal Concert to Commemorate the Holocaust’''. This concert, which was conceived and conducted by American Maestro [[Gilbert Levine]], was attended by the [[Elio Toaff|Chief Rabbi of Rome]], the [[President of Italy]], and survivors of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] from around the world. <ref name="Fandango"/><ref name="Anti-Defamation League"/> . 

In March 2000, John Paul&nbsp;II visited [[Yad Vashem]], the national Holocaust memorial in Israel, and later made history by touching one of the holiest sites in Judaism, the [[Western Wall]] in [[Jerusalem]],<ref name="ADL2006"/> placing a letter inside it (in which he prayed for forgiveness for the actions against Jews). <ref name="BBCIsrael"/><ref name="ADL2006"/><ref name="AIJAC"/> In part of his address he said: "I assure the Jewish people the Catholic Church... is deeply saddened by the hatred, acts of persecution and displays of anti-Semitism directed against the Jews by Christians at any time and in any place", he added that there were "no words strong enough to deplore the terrible tragedy of the Holocaust". <ref name="BBCIsrael"/><ref name="ADL2006"/> [[Cabinet of Israel|Israeli cabinet]] minister Rabbi [[Michael Melchior]], who hosted the Pope's visit, said he was "very moved" by the Pope's gesture. <ref name="BBCIsrael"/><ref name="ADL2006"/>
<blockquote>It was beyond history, beyond memory. <ref name="BBCIsrael"/></blockquote>
<blockquote>We are deeply saddened by the behaviour of those who in the course of history have caused these children of yours to suffer, and asking your forgiveness we wish to commit ourselves to genuine brotherhood with the people of the Covenant. <ref name="Online News"/></blockquote>
In October 2003, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) issued a statement congratulating John Paul II on entering the 25th year of his papacy. In January 2005, John Paul II became the first Pope in history known to receive a [[Priestly Blessing|priestly blessing]] from a rabbi, when Rabbis [[Benjamin Blech]], [[Barry Dov Schwartz]], and Jack Bemporad visited the Pontiff at [[Clementine Hall]] in the [[Apostolic Palace]]. <ref name="PTWF"/> . 

Immediately after John Paul II's death, the ADL issued a statement that Pope John Paul&nbsp;II had revolutionised [[relations between Catholicism and Judaism|Catholic-Jewish relations]], saying that "more change for the better took place in his 27 year Papacy than in the nearly 2,000 years before."<ref name="ADL2"/> In another statement issued by the Australia/Israel & Jewish Affairs Council, Director Dr Colin Rubenstein said, "The Pope will be remembered for his inspiring spiritual leadership in the cause of freedom and humanity. He achieved far more in terms of [[Christian-Jewish reconciliation|transforming relations]] with both the Jewish people and the State of Israel than any other figure in the history of the Catholic Church". <ref name="AIJAC"/>
<blockquote> With Judaism, therefore, we have a relationship which we do not have with any other religion. You are our dearly beloved brothers, and in a certain way, it could be said that you are our ''elder'' brothers. <ref name="Quotes2"/></blockquote> . 

====Lutheranism====. 
On 15–19 November 1980 John Paul II visited the Federal Republic of Germany<ref name="Travels - Federal Republic of Germany 1980 - John Paul II - The Holy Father - The Holy See"/> on his first trip to a country with a large [[Lutheran]] population. In [[Mainz]] he met with leaders of the Lutheran and other Protestant Churches, and with representatives of other Christian denominations.  . 

On 11 December 1983 John Paul II participated in an ecumenical service in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome,<ref name="Ökumenisches Treffen mit der evangelisch-lutherischen Gemeinde von Rom"/> the first papal visit ever to a Lutheran church. The visit took place 500 years after the birth of [[Martin Luther]], the German [[Augustinian]] monk who initiated the Lutheran reformation.  . 

In his apostolic pilgrimage to Norway, Iceland, Finland, Denmark and Sweden of June 1989,<ref name="vatican"/> John Paul II became the first pope to visit countries with Lutheran majorities. In addition to celebrating Mass with Catholic believers, he participated in ecumenical services at places that had been Catholic shrines before the 16th century Lutheran [[reformation]]: [[Nidaros Cathedral]] in Norway; near St. Olav's Church at [[Þingvellir|Thingvellir]] in Iceland; [[Turku Cathedral]] in Finland; [[Roskilde Cathedral]] in Denmark; and [[Uppsala Cathedral]] in Sweden.  . 

On 31 October 1999 (the 482nd anniversary of [[Reformation Day]], Martin Luther's posting of the [[The Ninety-Five Theses|95 Theses]]), representatives of the Vatican and the [[Lutheran World Federation]] (LWF) signed a [[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]], as a gesture of unity. The signing was a fruit of a theological dialogue that had been going on between the LWF and the Vatican since 1965.  . 

===Role in the fall of Communism===. 
[[File:Vladimir Putin with Pope John Paul II-1.jpg|thumb|Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] meeting Pope John Paul&nbsp;II]]
{{main|Holy See–Soviet Union relations}} . 

John Paul&nbsp;II has been credited with being instrumental in bringing down communism in Central and Eastern Europe,<ref name="Memory"/><ref name="Bottum"/>{{sfn|Maxwell-Stuart|2006|p=234}}<ref name="CBCNews"/><ref name="Gorbachev"/>{{sfn|Domínguez|2005}} by being the spiritual inspiration behind its downfall and catalyst for "a peaceful revolution" in Poland. [[Lech Wałęsa]], the founder of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|‘Solidarity’]], credited John Paul&nbsp;II with giving Poles the courage to demand change. <ref name="Memory"/> According to Wałęsa, "Before his pontificate, the world was divided into blocs. Nobody knew how to get rid of communism. In [[Warsaw]], in 1979, he simply said: 'Do not be afraid', and later prayed: 'Let your Spirit descend and change the image of the land... this land'."{{sfn|Domínguez|2005}} It has also been widely alleged that the [[Vatican Bank]] covertly funded Solidarity. <ref name="NYTimes"/><ref name="Salinger2005"/> . 

President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s correspondence with the pope reveals "a continuous scurrying to shore up Vatican support for U.S. policies. Perhaps most surprisingly, the papers show that, as late as 1984, the pope did not believe the Communist Polish government could be changed."<ref name="nationalreview"/> . 

In December 1989, John Paul II met with [[List of heads of state of the Soviet Union|Soviet leader]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] at the Vatican and each expressed his respect and admiration for the other. Gorbachev once said "The collapse of the [[Iron Curtain]] would have been impossible without John Paul II". <ref name="Bottum"/><ref name="CBCNews"/> On John Paul's death, Mikhail Gorbachev said: "Pope John Paul&nbsp;II's devotion to his followers is a remarkable example to all of us."<ref name="Gorbachev"/>{{sfn|Domínguez|2005}}

On 2 March 2006 the Italian parliament's [[Mitrokhin Commission]], set up by [[Silvio Berlusconi]] and headed by ''[[Forza Italia]]'' senator [[Paolo Guzzanti]], concluded that the [[Soviet Union]] was behind the attempt on John Paul II's life,<ref name="SanFrancisco"/><ref name="ItalianPanel"/> in retaliation for the pope's support of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], the Catholic, pro-democratic Polish workers' movement, a theory which had already been supported by [[Michael Ledeen]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency|United States Central Intelligence Agency]] at the time. <ref name="SanFrancisco"/><ref name="ItalianPanel"/> The Italian report stated that Communist [[Bulgaria]]n security departments were utilised to prevent the Soviet Union's role from being uncovered. <ref name="ItalianPanel"/> The report stated that [[GRU|Soviet military intelligence ''(Glavnoje Razvedyvatel'noje Upravlenije)'']], not the KGB, were responsible. <ref name="ItalianPanel"/> Russian Foreign Intelligence Service spokesman Boris Labusov called the accusation ''‘absurd’''. <ref name="ItalianPanel"/> The Pope declared during a May 2002 visit to Bulgaria that the country's Soviet bloc-era leadership had nothing to do with the [[assassination|assassination attempt]]. <ref name="SanFrancisco"/><ref name="ItalianPanel"/> However, his secretary, [[Stanisław Dziwisz|Cardinal Stanisław Dziwisz]], alleged in his book ''A Life with Karol'', that the pope was convinced privately that the former Soviet Union was behind the attack. <ref name="Retire2"/> It was later discovered that many of John Paul II's aides had foreign government attachments;<ref name="Thomas2000"/> Bulgaria and Russia disputed the Italian commission's conclusions, pointing out that the Pope had publicly denied the Bulgarian connection. <ref name="ItalianPanel"/>
A second assassination attempt took place on 12 May 1982, just a day before the anniversary of the first attempt on his life, in [[Fátima, Portugal|Fátima]], Portugal when a man tried to stab John Paul II with a [[bayonet]]. <ref name="Krohn"/><ref name="CBC2"/><ref name="Reuters3"/> He was stopped by security guards, although [[Stanisław Dziwisz]] later claimed that John Paul II had been injured during the attempt but managed to hide a non-life threatening wound. <ref name="Krohn"/><ref name="CBC2"/><ref name="Reuters3"/> The assailant, a traditionalist Spanish priest named [[Juan María Fernández y Krohn]],<ref name="Krohn"/> was ordained as a priest by [[Marcel Lefebvre|Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre]] of the [[Society of St. Pius X|Society of Saint Pius X]] and was opposed to the changes caused by the [[Second Vatican Council]], claiming that the pope was an agent of Communist Moscow and of the Marxist [[Eastern Bloc]].{{sfn|Hebblethwaite|1995|p=95}} Fernández y Krohn subsequently left the priesthood and served three years of a six-year sentence. <ref name="CBC2"/><ref name="Reuters3"/>{{sfn|Hebblethwaite|1995|p=95}} The ex-priest was treated for [[mental illness]] and then expelled from Portugal to become a solicitor in Belgium.{{sfn|Hebblethwaite|1995|p=95}} . 

Pope John Paul&nbsp;II was also a target of the [[Al-Qaeda]]-funded [[Bojinka plot]] during a visit to the Philippines in 1995. The first plan was to kill him in the Philippines during [[World Youth Day 1995]] celebrations. On 15 January 1995, a [[suicide attack|suicide bomber]] was planning to dress as a priest, while John Paul II passed in his [[motorcade]] on his way to the San Carlos Seminary in [[Makati City]]. The would-be-assassin intended to get close and detonate the bomb. The assassination was supposed to divert attention from the next phase of the operation. However, a chemical fire inadvertently started by the cell alerted police to their whereabouts, and all were arrested a week before the Pope's visit, confessing to the plot. <ref name="ThePlot"/> . 

In 2009 journalist and former army intelligence officer [[John Koehler]] published ''Spies in the Vatican: The Soviet Union's Cold War Against the Catholic Church''. <ref name="Koehler2011"/> Mining mostly East German and Polish secret police archives, Koehler says the assassination attempts were "KGB-backed" and gives details. <ref>''Publishers Weekly'', review of 'Spies in the Vatican', May 11, 2009</ref> During John Paul II's reign there were many [[cleric]]s within the Vatican who on nomination, declined to be ordained, and then mysteriously left the church. There is wide speculation that they were, in reality, [[KGB]] agents.  . 

==Health==. 
{{main|Pope John Paul II's health}} . 

[[File:PapstJPII20040922.jpg|thumb|The ailing Pope John Paul II riding in the [[Popemobile]] on 22 September 2004]]
When he became pope in 1978, John Paul II was still an avid sportsman. At the time, the 58-year old was extremely healthy and active, jogging in the [[Gardens of Vatican City|Vatican gardens]], weight training, swimming, and hiking in the mountains. He was fond of football. The media contrasted the new Pope's athleticism and trim figure to the poor health of [[Pope John Paul I|John Paul I]] and [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]], the portliness of [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]] and the constant claims of ailments of [[Pope Pius XII|Pius XII]]. The only modern pope with a fitness regimen had been [[Pope Pius XI]] (1922–1939) who was an avid mountaineer. <ref name="Ratti"/><ref name="Ratti2"/> An ''[[Irish Independent]]'' article in the 1980s labelled John Paul II the ''keep-fit pope''.  . 

However, after over twenty-five years on the papal throne, two [[assassination]] attempts (one of which resulted in severe physical injury to the Pope), and a number of [[cancer]] scares, John Paul's physical health declined. In 2001 he was diagnosed as suffering from [[Parkinson's disease]]. <ref name="Parkinsons2001"/> International observers had suspected this for some time but it was only publicly acknowledged by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] in 2003. Despite difficulty speaking more than a few sentences at a time, trouble [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]] and severe [[osteoarthrosis]], he continued to tour the world, although rarely walking in public.  .

{{main|Funeral of Pope John Paul II}} . 

On 31 March 2005 following a [[urinary tract infection]],{{sfn|BBC 2005-04-01}} Pope John Paul&nbsp;II developed [[septic shock]], a form of infection with a high [[fever]] and low [[blood pressure]], but was not hospitalised. Instead, he was [[medical monitor|monitored]] by a team of consultants at his private residence. This was taken as an indication that the pope and those close to him believed that he was nearing death; it would have been in accordance with his wishes to die in the Vatican.{{sfn|BBC 2005-04-01}} Later that day, Vatican sources announced that John Paul II had been given the [[Anointing of the Sick]] by his friend and secretary [[Stanisław Dziwisz]]. During the final days of the Pope's life, the lights were kept burning through the night where he lay in the Papal apartment on the top floor of the [[Apostolic Palace]]. Tens of thousands of people assembled and held vigil in [[Saint Peter's Square|St. Peter's Square]] and the surrounding streets for two days. Upon hearing of this, the dying pope was said to have stated: "I have searched for you, and now you have come to me, and I thank you."<ref name="LastWords"/> . 

On Saturday 2 April 2005, at about 15:30 [[Central European Summer Time|CEST]], John Paul II spoke his final words, ''"Pozwólcie mi odejść do domu Ojca"'', ("Let me depart to the house of the Father"), to his aides, and fell into a coma about four hours later. <ref name="LastWords"/><ref name="BBCLastWords"/> The mass of the vigil of the [[Divine Mercy Sunday|Second Sunday of Easter]] commemorating the [[canonisation]] of [[Mary Faustina Kowalska|Saint Maria Faustina]] on 30 April 2000, had just been celebrated at his bedside, presided over by Stanisław Dziwisz and two Polish associates. Present at the bedside was a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] from [[Ukraine]] who served as a priest with John Paul in Poland, along with Polish nuns of the Congregation of the Sisters Servants of the Most [[Sacred Heart]] of Jesus, who ran the [[Prefecture of the Pontifical Household|papal household]]. He died in his private apartment, at 21:37 CEST<ref name="BBCLastWords"/><ref name="Pisa"/>{{sfn|Navarro-Valls 2 April 2005}} (19:37 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) of heart failure from profound [[hypotension]] and complete [[circulatory collapse]] from septic shock, 46 days short of his 85th birthday. John Paul had no close family by the time he died, and his feelings are reflected in his words, as written in 2000, at the end of [[Testament of Pope John Paul II|his Last Will and Testament]].{{sfn|Stourton|2006|p=320}} . 

The death of the pontiff set in motion rituals and traditions dating back to medieval times. The Rite of Visitation took place from 4 to 7 April at [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. The [[Testament of Pope John Paul II]] published on 7 April<ref name="Last Will"/> revealed that the pontiff contemplated being buried in his native Poland but left the final decision to The [[College of Cardinals]], which in passing, preferred burial beneath St. Peter's Basilica, honouring the pontiff's request to be placed "in bare earth". [[Mass (liturgy)|The Mass]] of Requiem on 8 April was said to have set world records both for attendance and number of [[head of state|heads of state]] present at a funeral. <ref name="MsnbcNews2"/><ref name="CNN"/><ref name="Independent"/><ref name="BBCMiracle"/> ''(See: [[List of dignitaries at the funeral of Pope John Paul II|List of Dignitaries]])''. It was the single largest gathering of heads of state in history, surpassing the funerals of [[Winston Churchill]] (1965) and [[Josip Broz Tito#Final years|Josip Broz Tito]] (1980). Four kings, five queens, at least 70 presidents and prime ministers, and more than 14 leaders of other religions attended alongside the faithful. <ref name="CNN"/> It is likely to have been the largest single [[pilgrimage]] of Christianity ever, with numbers estimated in excess of four million mourners gathering in Rome. <ref name="MsnbcNews2"/><ref name="Independent"/><ref name="BBCMiracle"/><ref name="Beltway"/> Between 250,000 and 300,000 watched the event from within the Vatican walls. <ref name="BBCMiracle"/> The [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]], [[Pope Benedict XVI|Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger]], who would become the next pope, conducted the ceremony. John Paul II was interred in the [[grotto]]es under the basilica, the [[List of extant papal tombs|Tomb of the Popes]]. He was lowered into a tomb created in the same [[alcove]] previously occupied by the remains of [[Pope John XXIII]]. The alcove had been empty since Pope John's remains had been moved into the main body of the basilica after his beatification.  .

Upon the death of John Paul II, a number of clergy at the Vatican and laymen throughout the world<ref name="Bottum"/><ref name="MsnbcNews2"/><ref name="Arlington"/> began referring to the late pontiff as "John Paul the Great"—only the fourth pope to be so acclaimed, and the first since the [[1st millennium|first millennium]]. <ref name="Bottum"/><ref name="Arlington"/><ref name="OReilly-David"/><ref name="Murphy-Brian"/> Scholars of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] say that there is no official process for declaring a pope "Great"; the title simply establishes itself through popular and continued usage,<ref name="MsnbcNews2"/><ref name="Noonan"/><ref name="Noonan2"/> as was the case with celebrated secular leaders (for example, Alexander III of Macedon became popularly known as [[Alexander the Great]]). The three popes who today commonly are known as "Great" are [[Pope Leo I|Leo I]], who reigned from 440–461 and persuaded [[Attila the Hun]] to withdraw from Rome; [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory I]], 590–604, after whom the [[Gregorian chant|Gregorian Chant]] is named; and [[Pope Nicholas I]], 858–867. <ref name="Arlington"/> . 

His successor, [[Pope Benedict XVI]], referred to him as "the great Pope John Paul&nbsp;II" in his first address<ref name="FirstSpeech"/> from the [[loggia]] of St. Peter's Church, and [[Angelo Sodano|Angelo Cardinal Sodano]] referred to Pope John Paul&nbsp;II as "the Great" in his published written [[homily]] for the Mass of Repose. <ref name="Homily"/> . 

Since giving his homily at the funeral of Pope John Paul, Pope Benedict XVI has continued to refer to John Paul II as "the Great." At the [[World Youth Day 2005|20th World Youth Day]] in Germany 2005, Pope Benedict XVI, speaking in Polish, John Paul's native language, said, "As the Great Pope John Paul&nbsp;II would say: keep the flame of faith alive in your lives and your people." In May 2006, Pope Benedict XVI visited John Paul's native Poland. During that visit, he repeatedly made references to "the great John Paul" and "my great predecessor". <ref name="Poland2006"/> . 

In addition to the Vatican calling him "the great," numerous newspapers have done so. For example, the Italian newspaper ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' called him "the Greatest" and the South African Catholic newspaper, ''[[The Southern Cross (South Africa)|The Southern Cross]]'', has called him "John Paul II The Great". <ref name="Southern"/> and many Catholic schools worldwide have been named after him using this title, for example recently renamed [[John Paul the Great Catholic University]] and [[John Paul the Great Catholic High School (Virginia)|John Paul the Great Catholic High School]].  .

In early 2006, it was reported that the Vatican was investigating a possible [[miracle]] associated with John Paul II. [[Sister Marie Simon-Pierre]], a French nun and a member of the Congregation of Little Sisters of Catholic Maternity Wards, confined to her bed by 
[[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's Disease]],<ref name="Hooper1"/><ref name="Vicariato"/> was reported to have experienced a "complete and lasting cure after members of her community prayed for the intercession of Pope John Paul II". <ref name="NYTimes"/><ref name="MsnbcNews2"/><ref name="Moore1"/><ref name="Hooper1"/><ref name="ABC"/><ref name="Trinity"/> {{As of|2008|5}}, Sister Marie-Simon-Pierre, then 46,<ref name="Moore1"/><ref name="Hooper1"/> was working again at a [[Obstetrics|maternity hospital]] run by her [[Religious order|order]]. <ref name="Metro"/><ref name="Vicariato"/><ref name="Miracle-americancatholic"/><ref name="Willan"/> . 

"I was sick and now I am cured," she told reporter Gerry Shaw. "I am cured, but it is up to the church to say whether it was a miracle or not."<ref name="Vicariato"/><ref name="Miracle-americancatholic"/> . 

On 28 May 2006, Pope Benedict XVI said Mass before an estimated 900,000 people in John Paul II's native Poland. During his [[homily]], he encouraged prayers for the early canonisation of John Paul II and stated that he hoped canonisation would happen "in the near future."<ref name="Vicariato"/><ref name="Homily-Blonie-Park"/> . 

In January 2007, [[Stanisław Dziwisz|Stanisław Cardinal Dziwisz]] of Kraków, his former secretary, announced that the interview phase of the beatification process, in Italy and Poland, was nearing completion. <ref name="MsnbcNews2"/><ref name="Vicariato"/><ref name="Westcott"/> In February 2007, relics of Pope John Paul II—pieces of white papal [[cassock]]s he used to wear—were freely distributed with prayer cards for the cause, a typical pious practice after a saintly Catholic's death. <ref name="MMoore"/><ref name="Cause"/> On 8 March 2007, the [[Cardinal Vicar|Vicariate of Rome]] announced that the diocesan phase of John Paul's cause for beatification was at an end. Following a ceremony on 2 April 2007 – the second anniversary of the Pontiff's death – the cause proceeded to the scrutiny of the committee of lay, clerical, and episcopal members of the Vatican's [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]], to conduct a separate investigation. <ref name="Vicariato"/><ref name="Westcott"/><ref name="Hollingshead "/> On the fourth anniversary of Pope John Paul's death, 2 April 2009, Cardinal Dziwisz, told reporters of a presumed miracle that had recently occurred at the former pope's tomb in St. Peter's Basilica. <ref name="Miracle-americancatholic"/><ref name="MailOnline"/><ref name="ncregister"/><ref name="Catholic"/> A nine year-old Polish boy from [[Gdańsk]], who was suffering from kidney cancer and was completely unable to walk, had been visiting the tomb with his parents.

Once the second decree is signed, the ''positio'' (the report on the cause, with documentation about his life and writings and with information on the cause) is complete. <ref name="Catholic Culture"/> He can then be beatified. <ref name="abcNews"/><ref name="Catholic Culture"/> Some speculated that he would be beatified sometime during (or soon after) the month of the 32nd anniversary of his 1978 election, in October 2010. As Monsignor Oder noted, this course would have been possible if the second decree were signed in time by Benedict XVI, stating that a posthumous miracle directly attributable to his intercession had occurred, completing the positio.  . 

The Vatican announced on 14 January 2011 that Pope Benedict XVI had confirmed the miracle involving Sister Marie Simon-Pierre and that John Paul II was to be beatified on 1 May, the [[Divine Mercy Sunday|Feast of Divine Mercy]]. <ref name="BBC-beatify"/> 1 May is commemorated in former communist countries, such as Poland, and some Western European countries as May Day, and Pope John Paul&nbsp;II was well-known for his contributions to communism's relatively peaceful demise. <ref name="Bottum"/><ref name="CBCNews"/> In March 2011 the Polish mint issued a gold 1,000 Polish [[złoty]] coin (equivalent to US$350), with the Pope's image to commemorate his beatification. <ref name="yahoo"/>  . 

On 29 April 2011, Pope John Paul&nbsp;II's coffin was exhumed from the grotto beneath St. Peter's Basilica ahead of his beatification, as tens of thousands of people arrived in Rome for one of the biggest events since his funeral. <ref name="Pope John Paul II's body exhumed ahead of beatification"/> John Paul II's remains (in a closed coffin) were placed in front of the Basilica's main altar, where believers could pay their respect before and after the beatification mass in [[St. Peter's Square]] on 1 May. On 3 May 2011 Blessed Pope John Paul&nbsp;II was given a new resting place in the marble altar in Pier Paolo Cristofari's Chapel of [[St. Sebastian]], which is where [[Pope Innocent XI]] was buried. This more prominent location, next to the [[Chapel of the Pieta]], the [[Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament]] and statues of Popes [[Pope Pius XI|Pius XI]] and [[Pope Pius XII|Pius XII]], was intended to allow more pilgrims to view his memorial.  . 

== Criticism and controversy ==. 
{{main|1=Criticism of Pope John Paul II|2=Criticism of the Catholic Church}}
[[File:NDH - salute.jpg|thumb|In 1998 the Croatian war-time Archbishop [[Aloysius Stepinac]] (far right) was declared a martyr and beatified by John Paul II. Critics say that Stepinac was pro-[[Ustaše]], tolerating the forced conversions of [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Serbs]] to Catholicism.]]
John Paul II was widely criticised, amongst other things,<ref name="Critics"/> for his views against the [[ordination of women]] and [[contraception]], his support for the [[Second Vatican Council]] and its reform of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Liturgy]], and his stance on the sanctity of [[marriage]]. <ref name="A&E"/><ref name="Condom"/> . 

=== Opposition to his beatification ===. 
Some Catholic [[Theology|theologians]] disagree with the call for beatification of Pope John Paul&nbsp;II. Eleven dissident theologians, including [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] professor [[Jose Maria Castillo]] and Italian theologian [[Giovanni Franzoni]] raised seven points, including his stance against contraception and the ordination of women as well as the Church scandals that presented "facts which according to their consciences and convictions should be an obstacle to beatification".  . 

=== Child sex abuse scandals ===. 
{{main|Catholic sex abuse cases}}
John Paul II was also criticised for failing to respond quickly enough to the [[Catholic sex abuse cases|sex abuse crisis]]. In his response, he stated that "there is no place in the priesthood and [[Religious order|religious life]] for those who would harm the young". <ref name="Walsh"/> The Church instituted reforms to prevent future abuse by requiring background checks for Church employees<ref name="charteryouth"/> and, because a significant majority of victims were teenage boys, disallowing ordination of men with "deep–seated homosexual tendencies". <ref name="vatdocord"/><ref name="sexabusereport"/> They now require dioceses faced with an allegation to alert the authorities, conduct an investigation and remove the accused from duty. <ref name="charteryouth"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Scandals in the church: The Bishops' Decisions; The Bishops' Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People |work=The New York Times |date=15 June 2002 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906EFDA133CF936A25755C0A9649C8B63&scp=1&sq=Charter+for+the+Protection+of+Children+and+Young+People&st=nyt |accessdate=12 February 2008}}{{dead link|date=January 2012}}</ref> In 2008, the Church asserted that the scandal was a very serious problem and estimated that it was "probably caused by 'no more than 1 per cent' " (or 5,000) of the over 500,000 Catholic priests worldwide. <ref name="sexabuse"/><ref name="JohnJay"/> . 

In April 2002, John Paul II, despite being frail from Parkinson’s disease, read a statement intended for the American cardinals, calling the sex abuse ''"an appalling sin"'' and said the priesthood had no room for such men. <ref name="Shame"/> . 

In 2003 John Paul&nbsp;II reiterated that "there is no place in the priesthood and religious life for those who would harm the young". <ref name="Walsh"/> and in April 2003, the [[Pontifical Academy for Life]] organised a three-day conference, entitled "Abuse of Children and Young People by Catholic Priests and Religious", where eight non-Catholic psychiatric experts were invited to speak to near all Vatican dicasteries' representatives. The panel of experts overwhelmingly opposed implementation of policies of "zero-tolerance" such as was proposed by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops. One expert called such policies a "case of overkill" since they do not permit flexibility to allow for differences among individual cases. <ref name="VaticanStudy"/> . 

In 2004 Pope John Paul&nbsp;II appointed [[Bernard Francis Law]] as Archpriest of the Papal Basilica of Saint Mary Major in Rome. Law had previously resigned as [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston|archbishop of Boston]] in 2002 in response to the [[Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal]] after Church documents were revealed which suggested he had covered up sexual abuse committed by priests in his archdiocese. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/extras/law_timeline.htm |title=Boston Globe / Spotlight / Abuse in the Catholic Church / Cardinal Law and the laity |first=|last=The Boston Globe, Boston |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=© Copyright 2004 The New York Times Company |publisher=[[New York Times Company|NYTC]] |location=[[Boston, MA|Boston]] |issn=0743-1791|accessdate=24 January 2012}}</ref> Law resigned from this position in November 2011. <ref name="Shame"/> . 

=== Opus Dei controversies ===. 
{{main|Controversies about Opus Dei}}
John Paul II was criticised for his support of the [[Opus Dei]] prelature and the 2002 [[canonization|canonisation]] of its founder, [[Josemaría Escrivá]], whom he called 'the saint of ordinary life.'<ref name="Opus2"/><ref name="Saints2"/> Other movements and religious organisations of the Church went decidedly under his wing ([[Legion of Christ]], the [[Neocatechumenal Way]], [[Schoenstatt Movement|Schoenstatt]], the [[Charismatic Movement|charismatic movement]], etc.) and he was accused repeatedly of waving a soft hand on them, especially in the case of Rev.

=== Banco Ambrosiano scandal ===. 
{{main|Banco Ambrosiano}}
Pope John Paul was alleged to have links with [[Banco Ambrosiano]], an Italian bank which collapsed in 1982. <ref name="NYTimes"/> At the centre of the bank's failure was its chairman, [[Roberto Calvi]] and his membership in the illegal [[Masonic Lodge]] [[Propaganda Due]] (aka P2). The [[Vatican Bank]] was Banco Ambrosiano's main shareholder, and the death of [[Pope John Paul I]] in 1978 is rumoured to be linked to the Ambrosiano scandal. <ref name="Salinger2005"/> . 

Calvi, often referred to as "God's Banker", was also involved the Vatican Bank, [[Istituto per le Opere di Religione]], in his dealings, and was close to Bishop [[Paul Marcinkus]], the bank's chairman. Ambrosiano also provided funds for political parties in Italy, and for both the [[Somoza]] dictatorship in [[Nicaragua]] and its [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] opposition. There are also rumours that it provided money for [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] in [[Poland]]. It has been widely alleged that the [[Vatican Bank]] funded Solidarity. <ref name="NYTimes"/><ref name="Salinger2005"/> . 

Calvi used his complex network of overseas banks and companies to move money out of Italy, to inflate share prices, and to secure massive unsecured loans. In 1978, the [[Banca d'Italia|Bank of Italy]] produced a report on Ambrosiano that predicted future disaster. <ref name="Salinger2005"/> On 5 June 1982, two weeks before the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano, Calvi had written a letter of warning to Pope John Paul II, stating that such a forthcoming event would “provoke a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions in which the Church will suffer the gravest damage."<ref name="TimesOnline"/> On 18 June 1982 Calvi's body was found hanging from scaffolding beneath [[Blackfriars Bridge]] in the financial district of London. Calvi's clothing was stuffed with bricks, and contained cash valued at US$14,000, in three different currencies. <ref name="GodsBanker"/> . 

=== Birth control and gender roles ===. 
{{main|Women in Christianity}}
John Paul II's defence of traditional moral teachings of the Catholic Church regarding [[gender role]]s, [[human sexuality|sexuality]], [[euthanasia]], artificial [[Birth control|contraception]] and [[abortion]] came under attack. Some [[Christian feminism|feminists]] criticised his traditional positions on the roles of women, which included rejecting [[ordination of women|women priests]]. According to Aisha Taylor, coordinator of the Young Feminist Network:  . 

<blockquote>The legacy of Pope John Paul II is vibrant and extraordinary, yet painfully inconsistent. The contradiction in his legacy lies in his teaching and actions on the dignity of women. John Paul II called for women to be included as decision makers in secular governments. However, when it came to bringing women into the decision making bodies of his church, he slammed the door in our faces, barring us from ordination and locking the door by stating the discussion about women’s ordination is closed. <ref name="Aisha"/></blockquote> . 

=== Gay rights activists ===. 
{{main|Christianity and homosexuality}}
Many [[LGBT social movements|gay rights]] [[Activism|activists]] and others criticised him for maintaining the Church's unbroken opposition to [[homosexuality|homosexual behaviour]] and [[same-sex marriage]]. During John Paul II's reign, the Vatican described homosexuality as an "objective disorder" and in his own book ''[[Memory and Identity]]'' John Paul II describes the concept of gay families as an "ideology of evil",{{sfn|Pope John Paul II|2005|p=12}} phrases which incensed many parts of the [[LGBT community]]. <ref name="DoctrineOfFaith"/> . 

=== Problems with Traditionalists ===. 
In addition to all the criticism from those demanding modernisation, [[traditionalist Catholic]]s sometimes denounced him as well. These issues included demanding a return to the [[Tridentine Mass]]<ref name="HughHewitt"/> and repudiation of the reforms instituted after the [[Second Vatican Council]], such as the use of the vernacular language in the formerly Latin [[Roman Rite]] Mass, [[ecumenism]], and the principle of [[Freedom of religion|religious liberty]]. He was also accused by these critics for allowing and appointing liberal bishops in their sees and thus silently promoting [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|Modernism]], which was firmly condemned as the "synthesis of all heresies" by his predecessor [[Pope Pius X|Pope St. Pius X]]. In 1988, the controversial traditionalist Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]], founder of the [[Society of St. Pius X]] (1970), was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] under John Paul II because of the unapproved ordination of four bishops, which was called by the [[Holy See]] a "schismatic act".  . 

The [[World Day of Prayer for Peace]],<ref name="Assisi4"/> with a meeting in [[Assisi]], Italy, in 1986, in which the Pope prayed only with the Christians,<ref name="SanRufino"/>
was heavily criticised as giving the impression that [[syncretism]] and [[indifferentism]] <!-- Don't change it back to "syncretism and/or indifferentism" as "and" gives the same ambiguity, e.g., that the event embraced or syncretism or indifferentism or both; see [[MOS#And/or]] --> were openly embraced by the Papal [[Magisterium]]. When a second ‘Day of Prayer for Peace in the World’<ref name="DayOfPrayer"/> was held, in 2002, it was condemned as confusing the laity and compromising to "false religions". Likewise criticised was his kissing<ref name="Qu'ran"/> of the [[Qur'an]] in [[Damascus]], [[Syria]], on one of his travels on 6 May 2001. His call for religious freedom was not always supported; bishops like [[Antônio de Castro Mayer]] promoted [[Religious toleration|religious tolerance]], but at the same time rejected the [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]] principle of religious liberty as being [[Liberalism|liberalist]] and already condemned by [[Pope Pius IX]] in his [[Syllabus of Errors|''‘Syllabus errorum’'']] (1864) and at the [[First Vatican Council]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} . 

Some Catholics oppose his [[beatification]] and potential canonisation for the above reasons. <ref>{{cite news|title=A Statement of Reservations Concerning the Impending Beatification of Pope John Paul II|date=2011-03-21|author=Michael J. Matt|newspaper=[[The Remnant (newspaper)|The Remnant]]|accessdate=2011-05-02|url=http://www.remnantnewspaper.com/2011-0331-statement-of-reservations-beatification.htm}}</ref> . 

=== Religion and AIDS ===. 
{{main|Religion and AIDS}}
John Paul's position against artificial birth control, including the use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIV,<ref name="Condom"/> was harshly criticised by doctors and [[AIDS]] activists, who said that it led to countless deaths and millions of [[AIDS]] [[orphan]]s. <ref name="Condom2"/> Critics have also claimed that large families are caused by lack of contraception and exacerbate [[Third World]] poverty and problems such as [[street children]] in South America. The [[CAFOD|Catholic Agency for Overseas Development]] published a paper stating, "Any strategy that enables a person to move from a higher-risk towards the lower end of the continuum, [we] believe, is a valid risk [[reduction strategy]]."<ref name="Condom3"/> . 

=== Centralisation ===. 
He was criticised for [[Centralisation|recentralising]] power back to the Vatican following what some viewed as a [[decentralization|decentralisation]] by [[Pope John XXIII]]. As such he was regarded by some as a strict [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]]. Conversely, he was also criticised for spending far too much time preparing for and undertaking foreign travel. The frequency of his trips, it was said, not only undermined the "specialness" of papal visits, but took him away from important business at the Vatican and allowed the Church, administratively speaking, to drift. Especially in [[South America]], he was criticised for conservative bias in his appointments of bishops; with an unusually long reign of over 25 years, the majority of bishops in place at his death had been appointed by him.  . 

=== Social programs ===. 
There was strong criticism of the pope for the controversy surrounding the alleged use of charitable social programs as a means of converting people in the [[Third World]] to [[Catholicism]]. <ref name="AsiaNews2"/><ref name="IndiaStar"/> The Pope created an uproar in the [[Indian sub continent|Indian subcontinent]] when he suggested that a great harvest of faith would be witnessed on the subcontinent in the third Christian millennium. <ref name="NCR2"/> . 

=== Protestant fundamentalists ===. 
In 1988, when Pope John Paul II was delivering a speech to the [[European Parliament]], then-leader of the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] and [[Moderator of the General Assembly|Moderator]] of the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster]], [[Ian Paisley]], shouted "I denounce you as the [[antichrist]]!"<ref name=LATimes>{{cite news|title=Ian Paisley and politics of peace|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/24/opinion/la-ed-paisley24-2010mar24|accessdate=16 February 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=24 March 2010}}</ref>  and held up a red banner reading "Pope John Paul II ANTICHRIST". [[Otto von Habsburg|Archduke Otto of Austria]], the last [[List of heirs to the Austrian throne|Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary]] snatched Lord Paisley's banner and, along with other [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s, helped eject him from the chamber. <ref name="BBCIreland"/><ref name="Paisley"/><ref name="NYT5"/><ref name="Cloud"/>
The Pope continued with his address after Lord Paisley had been ejected. <ref name="BBCIreland"/><ref name="MacDonald"/><ref name="Angelique"/> . 

===Apologies===. 
{{Main|Apologies by Pope John Paul II}}
John Paul II apologised to almost every group who had suffered at the hands of the Catholic Church through the years. <ref name="Memory"/>{{sfn|Pope John Paul II|2005|p=1}} Even before he became Pope, he was a prominent editor and supporter of initiatives like the [[Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops]] from 1965. As Pope, he officially made public apologies for over 100 wrongdoings, including:
*The legal process on the Italian scientist and philosopher [[Galileo Galilei]], himself a devout Catholic, around 1633 (31 October 1992). <ref name="MsnbcNews2"/><ref name="Adherents"/>
*Catholics' involvement with the [[African slave trade]] (9 August 1993). 
*The Church Hierarchy's role in [[Death by burning|burnings at the stake]] and the [[religious war]]s that followed the [[Protestant Reformation]] (May 1995, in the Czech Republic). 
*The injustices committed against women, the violation of [[women's rights]] and the historical denigration of women (10 July 1995, in a letter to "every woman"). 
*The inactivity and silence of many Catholics during the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] (see the article [[Religion in Nazi Germany]]) (16 March 1998). 
On 20 November 2001, from a laptop in the Vatican, Pope John Paul II sent his first e-mail apologising for the [[Catholic sex abuse cases]], the Church-backed "[[Stolen Generations]]" of Aboriginal children in Australia, and to [[PRC|China]] for the behaviour of Catholic missionaries in [[Colonialism|colonial times]]. <ref name="PopeApologises"/> .
