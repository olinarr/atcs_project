'''Casual sex''' or '''hooking up''' refers to certain types of [[human sexual activity]] outside the context of a [[romantic relationship]]. The term is not always used consistently: some use it to refer to any [[extramarital sex]], some use it to refer to sex in a [[casual relationship]], whereas others reserve its use for [[One-night stand|one-time encounters]], [[promiscuity]], or to refer to sex in the absence of emotional attachment or love. <ref>[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/casual casual - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/casual%20sex casual sex - Definitions from Dictionary.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> .

==Social norms and moral concerns== . 

World-wide attitudes to casual sex range from [[conservative]] and religious views, the extreme of which is [[capital punishment]] for sexual relations outside heterosexual marriage, to liberal or libertarian views, the extreme of which is [[free love]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  During the [[sexual revolution]] in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] in the 1960s and 1970s, social attitudes to sexual issues underwent considerable changes. The advent of [[the pill]] and other forms of [[birth control]], the [[Women's Liberation]] movement, and the legalization of [[abortion]] in many countries is believed to have led to a wider practice of casual sex. <ref>[http://www.umw.edu/hisa/resources/Student%20Projects/Ben%20Franklin%20--%20The%20Pill/students.mwc.edu/_bfran8wk/PILL/impac.html ''The Pill and Sexual Revolution'' Retrieved: 2010-03-28.]</ref><ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pill/peopleevents/e_lib.html ''People & Events: The Pill and the Women's Liberation Movement'' Retrieved: 2010-03-28.]</ref><ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20000928/aponline115709_000.htm ''FDA Approves Abortion Pill'' Retrieved: 2010-03-28.]</ref> Most religions disapprove of sex outside of marriage (see [[religion and sexuality]]).  . 

[[Swingers]] in the lifestyle engage in casual sex with others for a variety of reasons. For many, an advantage is the increased quality, quantity and frequency of sex. <ref>[http://swingersocial.com/swinger-blog/?page_id=1377 - Reasons for Swinging blog article "Pros and Cons of Swinging" published January 2012 The Swingers Blog by Johann Vanbeek]</ref> Some swingers engage in casual sex to add variety into their otherwise conventional sex lives or for curiosity.  Swingers who engage in casual sex maintain that sex among swingers is often more frank and deliberative and therefore more honest than infidelity. Some couples see swinging as a healthy outlet and means to strengthen their relationship. Others regard such activities as merely social and recreational interaction with others.  . 

A study of hooking up at the [[University of Iowa]] found that waiting to have sex doesn't contribute to a stronger future relationship. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100823185415.htm |title=Hookups' Can Turn Into Meaningful Relationships, Study Suggests |date=August 23, 2010 |work=[[Science Daily]] |accessdate=May 23, 2011}}</ref> Instead, they found that what mattered most was the goal individuals had going into a relationship.  Individuals who started by hooking up tended to develop a full relationship later on if that was their goal going in.  . 

==Related terms==. 
===Hookup===. 
A '''hookup''' ([[colloquialism|colloquial]] [[American English]]) is casual sex activity that could consist of manual stimulation, [[oral sex]], or [[sexual intercourse]].  . 

An '''extended hookup''' typically refers to prolonged instances of casual sex interactions.  This is a situation in which the involved parties occasionally meet for casual sex multiple times, always without a long-term commitment. This is a [[casual relationship]] specifically for sex and without any emotional aspect, for which another colloquial term is "fuck buddies".   . 

It is quite often found the people arrange such sexual activities through the internet, on web sites such as [[Craigslist]]. A '''booty call''' means that such an arrangement is made over the phone. <ref>http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=booty%20call</ref> . 

A slight variation on the extended hookup is '''friends with benefits''', where the involved parties have a degree of emotional attachment, and although they are happy to engage sexual interaction, do not want, for whatever reason, to have "strings attached" as a result.  . 

=== One-night stand ===. 
A [[one-night stand]] is a single [[human sexual activity|sexual encounter]] between individuals, where at least one of the parties has no immediate intention or expectation of establishing a longer-term sexual or romantic relationship.  .

[[Anonymous sex]] is a form of one-night stand or ''casual sex'' between people who have very little or no history with each other, often engaging in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] on the same day of their meeting and usually never seeing each other again afterwards. <ref>[http://www.thebody.com/content/art32205.html Anonymous Sex - The Body<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . 

==Commercial sites==. 
There are many specialist [[online dating service]]s or other [[internet]] websites, known as "adult personals" or "adult matching" sites, which cater to people looking for a purely physical relationship, without emotional attachments. These can provide a relatively anonymous forum where people who are geographically close but in totally separate work and social circles can make contact.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} .
