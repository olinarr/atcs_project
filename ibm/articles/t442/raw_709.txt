'''Safe sex''' is sexual activity engaged in by people who have taken precautions to protect themselves against [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STDs) such as [[AIDS]]. <ref>[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/safesex?view=uk Compact Oxford English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, 2009, Accessed 23/09/09]</ref> It is also referred to as '''safer sex''' or '''protected sex''', while '''unsafe''' or '''unprotected sex''' is sexual activity engaged in without precautions. Some sources prefer the term ''safer sex'' to more precisely reflect the fact that these practices reduce, but do not completely eliminate, the risk of disease transmission. <ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Safe+sex The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition, Houghton Mifflin Company, 2009, Accessed 23/09/09]</ref> In recent years, the term "sexually transmitted infections" (STIs) has been preferred over "STDs", as it has a broader range of meaning; a person may be infected, and may potentially infect others, without showing signs of disease.  . 

Safe sex practices became more prominent in the late 1980s as a result of the AIDS epidemic.  Promoting safe sex is now one of the  aims of [[sex education]]. Safe sex is regarded as a [[harm reduction]] strategy aimed at reducing risks. <ref name="Who">{{cite web| title = Global strategy for the prevention and control of sexually transmitted infections: 2006â€“2015.

PMID 10430236</ref> Although some safe sex practices can be used as [[contraception]], most forms of contraception do not protect against all or any STIs; likewise, some safe sex practices, like partner selection and low risk sex behavior, are not effective forms of contraception.  . 

Safe sex is effective on avoiding STDs if only both parties involved in sexual intercourse agreed on doing so and stick to it. During sexual intercourse using condoms, for example, the male might intentionally pull off the condom and continue penetrating without the female (or male receptive partner)'s consent and notice. This is a high risk behavior that betrays trust as well as spreading the disease.  . 

==Terminology==. 
{{Globalize|section|USA|date=August 2010}}
The term ''safer sex'' in Canada and the United States has gained greater use by health workers, reflecting that risk of transmission of sexually transmitted infections in various [[sexual activities]] is a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]]. The term ''safe sex'' is still in common use in the United Kingdom and Australia.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} . 

Although "safe sex" is used by individuals to refer to protection against both [[pregnancy]] and HIV/AIDS or other STI transmissions, the term was primarily derived in response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It is believed that the term of "safe sex" was used in the professional literature in 1984, in the content of a paper on the psychological effect that HIV/AIDS may have on [[homosexual]] men. The term was related with the need to develop educational programs for the group considered at risk, homosexual men. A year later, the same term appeared in an article in the [[New York Times]]. This article emphasized that most specialists advised their AIDS patients to practice safe sex. The concept included limiting the number of sexual partners, using prophylactics, avoiding bodily fluid exchange, and resisting the use of [[drugs]] that reduced inhibitions for high-risk sexual behavior. <ref name="A">{{cite web|url=http://www.csuchico.edu/cjhp/4/1/109-118-moskowitz.pdf|title=How Do Californians Define Safe Sex? |date=|accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref> Moreover, in 1985, the first safe sex guidelines were established by the 'Coalition for Sexual Responsibilities'.{{Who|date=August 2010}} According to these guidelines, safe sex was practiced by using [[condoms]] also when engaging in [[Anal sex|anal]] or [[oral sex]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} . 

Although this term was primarily used in conjunction with the homosexual male population, in 1986 the concept was spread to the general population. Various programs were developed with the aim of promoting safe sex practices among college students. These programs were focused on promoting the use of the condom, a better knowledge about the partner's sexual history and limiting the number of [[sexual partner]]s. The first book on this subject appeared in the same year. The book was entitled "Safe Sex in the Age of AIDS", it had 88 pages and it described both positive and negative approaches to the sexual life.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Sexual behavior could be either safe ([[kissing]], [[hugging]], [[massage]], [[dry humping|body-to-body rubbing]], [[mutual masturbation]], [[exhibitionism]] and [[voyeurism]], [[telephone sex]], [[sado-masochism]] without bruising or bleeding, and use of separate [[sex toys]]); possibly safe (use of condoms); and unsafe. <ref name="A"/> . 

In 1997, specialists in this matter promoted the use of condoms as the most accessible safe sex method (besides abstinence) and they called for [[TV commercials]] featuring condoms. During the same year, the [[Catholic Church]] in the United States issued their own "safer sex" guidelines on which condoms were listed, though two years later the [[Holy See|Vatican]] urged [[chastity]] and [[heterosexual]] marriage, attacking the American Catholic bishops' guidelines.  . 

A study carried out in 2006 by Californian specialists showed that the most common definitions of safe sex are condom use (68% of the interviewed subjects), abstinence (31.1% of the interviewed subjects), monogamy (28.4% of the interviewed subjects) and safe partner (18.7% of the interviewed subjects). <ref name="A"/> . 

"Safer sex" is thought to be a more aggressive term which may make it more obvious to individuals that any type of sexual activity carries a certain degree of [[risk]].  . 

The term "safe love" has also been used, notably by the French [[Sidaction]] in the promotion of men's underpants incorporating a condom pocket and including the red ribbon symbol in the design, which were sold to support the charity.  .

[[Image:Kunisada surimono.jpg|thumb|right|[[Shunga]] print by [[Kunisada]] depicting masturbation]] . 

===Avoiding physical contact===. 
Known as ''[[autoeroticism]]'', solitary sexual activity is relatively safe. [[Masturbation]], the simple act of stimulating one's own genitalia, is safe so long as contact is not made with other people's bodily fluids. Some activities, such as "[[phone sex]]" and "[[cybersex]]", that allow for partners to engage in sexual activity without being in the same room, eliminate the risks involved with exchanging bodily fluids. <ref name=plannedparenthood>{{cite web|url = http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/stds-hiv-safer-sex/safer-sex-4263.htm | title = Safer Sex ("Safe Sex") | accessdate = 2009-09-23}}</ref> . 

===Non-penetrative sex===. 
[[Image:PeterJohannNepomukGeigerEroticWatercolor04.jpg|thumb|right|[[Watercolor]] of manual stimulation of the penis, [[Johann Nepomuk Geiger]], 1840.]]
{{Main|Non-penetrative sex}} . 

A range of sex acts, sometimes called "outercourse", can be enjoyed with significantly reduced risks of infection or pregnancy.  U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]]'s surgeon general, Dr. [[Joycelyn Elders]], tried to encourage the use of these practices among young people, but her position encountered opposition from a number of outlets, including the White House itself, and resulted in her being fired by President Clinton in December 1994. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,982008,00.html|title=Getting Out the Wrecking Ball|publisher=Time|date=1994-12-19|accessdate=2009-03-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n1-2_v29/ai_19034244 | work=Washington Monthly | title=Joycelyn Elders: From Sharecropper's Daughter to Surgeon General of the United States of America. - book reviews | first=Leon | last=Dash | year=1997}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E0D81038F935A35752C1A960958260|title=President Clinton Makes a Celebratory Return to His Starting Point in Arkansas|publisher=New York Times|date=1996-11-06|accessdate=2009-03-08 | first=Alison | last=Mitchell}}</ref> . 

Non-penetrative sex includes practices such as kissing, mutual masturbation, rubbing or stroking and, according to the Health Department of Western Australia, this sexual practice may prevent pregnancy and most STIs. However, non-penetrative sex may not protect against infections that can be transmitted skin-to-skin such as [[herpes]] and [[genital warts]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} . 

===Barrier protection===. 
Various protective devices are used to avoid contact with [[blood]], [[vaginal fluid]], [[semen]] or other contaminant agents (like skin, hair and shared objects) during sexual activity. [[Human sexual activity|Sexual activity]] using these devices is called '''protected sex'''.  . 

[[Image:Tysk kondomautomat.jpg|thumb|right|[[Condom machine]]]]
*[[Condom]]s cover the penis during sexual activity. They are most frequently made of [[latex]], and can also be made out of synthetic materials including [[polyurethane]]. 
*[[Female condom]]s are inserted into the [[vagina]] prior to intercourse. 
*A [[dental dam]] (originally used in dentistry) is a sheet of latex used for protection when engaging in [[oral sex]]. It is typically used as a barrier between the mouth and the [[vulva]] during [[cunnilingus]] or between the mouth and the anus during [[analâ€“oral sex]]. 
*[[Medical gloves]] made out of latex, vinyl, [[nitrile rubber|nitrile]], or polyurethane may be used as a makeshift dental dam during oral sex, or to protect the hands during sexual stimulation, such as [[masturbation]]. Hands may have invisible cuts on them that may admit pathogens or contaminate the other body part or partner. 
*Another way to protect against pathogen transmission is the use of protected or properly cleaned [[dildo]]s and other [[sex toy]]s.  If a sex toy is to be used in more than one orifice or partner, a condom can be used over it and changed when the toy is moved.  . 

When latex barriers are used, oil-based [[Personal lubricant|lubrication]] can break down the structure of the latex and remove the protection it provides.  . 

Condoms (male or female) are used to protect against STIs, and used with other forms of contraception to improve contraceptive effectiveness.  For example, simultaneously using both the male condom and spermicide (applied separately, not pre-lubricated) is believed to reduce perfect-use pregnancy rates to those seen among implant users. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Kestelman P, Trussell J |title=Efficacy of the simultaneous use of condoms and spermicides | journal = Fam Plann Perspect | volume = 23 | issue = 5 |pages=226â€“232 |year=1991| pmid = 1743276 | doi = 10.2307/2135759 |publisher=Family Planning Perspectives, Vol. 23, No. 5 |jstor=2135759 }}</ref> However, if two condoms are used simultaneously (male condom on top of male condom, or male condom inside female condom), this increases the chance of condom failure. <ref>{{cite web |title=Does using two condoms provide more protection than using just one condom? |work=Condoms and Dental Dams |publisher=New York University Student Health Center |url=http://www.nyu.edu/shc/promotion/condoms.dental.dams.html |accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Are two condoms better than one? |work=[[Go Ask Alice!]] |publisher=Columbia University |date=2005-01-21 |url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/1139.html |accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> . 

Proper use of barriers, such as condoms, depends on the cleanliness of surfaces of the barrier, handling can pass contamination to and from surfaces of the barrier unless care is taken.  . 

Studies of latex condom performance during use reported breakage and slippage rates varying from 1.46% to 18.60%. <ref name="B">{{cite web|url=http://hivinsite.ucsf.edu/InSite?page=kb-07-02-02#S4.1.1X |title=Methods to Prevent Sexual Transmission of HIV |date=|accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref>  Condoms must be put on before any [[bodily fluid]] could be exchanged, and they must be used also during oral sex. <ref name="C">{{cite web|url=http://www.safesexdrive.com/health.php |title=Sexual Health Education |date=|accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref> . 

[[Female condom]]s are made of two flexible [[polyurethane]] rings and a loose-fitting polyurethane sheath. <ref name="B"/> According to laboratory testing, female condoms are effective in preventing the leakage of body fluids and therefore the transmission of STIs and HIV. Several studies show that between 50% and 73% of women who have used this type of condoms during intercourse find them as or more comfortable than male condoms. On the other hand, acceptability of these condoms among the male population is somewhat less, at approximately 40%. Because the cost of female condoms is higher than male condoms, there have been studies carried out with the aim of detecting whether they can be reused. Research has shown that structural integrity of polyurethane female condoms is not damaged during up to five uses if it is disinfected with water and [[household bleach]]. However, regardless of this study, specialists still recommend that female condoms are used only once and then discarded.  . 

===Other precautions===. 
Acknowledging that it is usually impossible to have entirely risk-free sex with another person, proponents of safe sex recommend that some of the following methods be used to minimize the risks of STI transmission and unwanted pregnancy. 
* [[Immunization]] against various viral infections that can be transmitted sexually. The most common vaccines are [[HPV vaccine]], which protects against the most common types of [[human papillomavirus]] that cause [[cervical cancer]], and the [[Hepatitis B vaccine]].  Immunization before initiation of sexual activity increases effectiveness. 
* [[Circumcision and HIV|Male circumcision and HIV]]: Some research has suggested that male [[circumcision]] can reduce the risk of HIV infection in some countries. The World Health Organization cites the procedure as a measure against the transmission of HIV between women and men; some African studies have found that circumcision can reduce the rate of transmission of HIV to men by up to 60%. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6502855.stm |title=WHO agrees HIV circumcision plan  |accessdate=2008-07-12 |work=BBC World News |publisher=BBC |date=2007-03-03 }}</ref> Some advocacy groups dispute these findings. <ref>[http://www.circumstitions.com/HIV-SA.html Circumcision and HIV<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://mgmbill.org/aids.htm Circumcision and AIDS<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In sub-Saharan Africa, at least, condom use and behavior change programs are estimated to be more efficient and much more cost-effective than surgical procedures such as circumcision. <ref>{{cite journal | author =  Mcallister RG, Travis JW, Bollinger D, Rutiser C, Sundar V| title = The cost to circumcise Africa | journal = [[International Journal of Men's Health]] | publisher = Men's Studies Press | volume = 7 | year = Fall 2008 | doi = 10.3149/jmh.0703.307 | pages = 307â€“316 | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+cost+to+circumcise+Africa.-a0189486243 | issn = 1532-6306 (Print) 1933-0278 (Online)| issue = 3 }}</ref>
* Periodic STI testing has been used to reduce STIs in Cuba and among pornographic film actors. Cuba implemented a program of mandatory testing and quarantine early in the AIDS epidemic. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thebody.com/content/art32967.html |title=Cuba fights AIDS in its Own Way  |accessdate=2009-06-13  |work=The Body |publisher=The Body|date=2009-06-13 }}</ref> In the US pornographic film industry, many production companies will not hire actors without tests for Chlamydia, HIV and Gonorrhea that are no more than 30 days old-and tests for other STIs no more than 6 months old.

* [[Monogamy]] or [[polyfidelity]], practiced faithfully, is very safe (as far as STIs are concerned) when all partners are non-infected. However, many monogamous people have been infected with sexually transmitted diseases by partners who are [[sexual infidelity|sexually unfaithful]], have used injection drugs, or were infected by previous sexual partners; the same risks apply to polyfidelitous people, who face higher risks depending on how many people are in the polyfidelitous group. 
* For those who are not monogamous, reducing the number of one's sexual partners, particularly anonymous sexual partners, may also reduce one's potential exposure to STIs. Similarly, one may restrict one's sexual contact to a community of trusted individuals&mdash;this is the approach taken by some [[pornographic actor]]s and other [[Forms of nonmonogamy|non-monogamous]] people. 
* When selecting a sexual partner, some characteristics can increase the risks for contracting sexually transmitted diseases. <ref name="partner">{{cite doi|10.1097/OLQ.0b013e3181901e32}}</ref> These include an age discordance of more than five years;<ref name="partner"/> having an STI in the past year;<ref name="partner"/> problems with alcohol;<ref name="partner"/> having had sex with other people in the past year. <ref name="partner"/>
* [[Communication]] with one's sexual partner(s) makes for greater safety.  Before initiating sexual activities, partners may discuss what activities they will and will not engage in, and what precautions they will take.  This can reduce the chance of risky decisions being made "in the heat of passion". 
* If a person is sexually active with a number of partners, regular [[sexual health clinic|sexual health]] check-ups by a doctor, and on noticing unusual symptoms seeking prompt medical advice; [[HIV]] and other infectious agents can be either [[asymptomatic]] or involve [[nonspecific symptoms]] which on their own can be misdiagnosed. <ref name=Kahn>{{cite journal

===Limitations=== . 

While the use of condoms can reduce transmission of HIV and other infectious agents, it does not do so completely.  One study has suggested condoms might reduce HIV transmission by 85% to 95%; effectiveness beyond 95% was deemed unlikely because of slippage, breakage, and incorrect use. <ref name="Varghese">Varghese B, Maher JE, Peterman TA, Branson BM, Steketee RW. (2002). [http://ww2.aegis.org/files/AskDoc_refs/varghese2002-29-1.pdf Reducing the risk of sexual HIV transmission: quantifying the per-act risk for HIV on the basis of choice of partner, sex act, and condom use]. Sex Transm Dis. 29(1):38-43. PMID 11773877</ref> It also said, "In practice, inconsistent use may reduce the overall effectiveness of condoms to as low as 60â€“70%". <ref name="Varghese"/><sup>p.&nbsp;40. </sup> . 

During each act of [[anal intercourse]], the risk of the receptive partner acquiring HIV from HIV seropositive partners not using condoms is about 1 in 120. Among people using condoms, the receptive partner's risk declines to 1 in 550, a four- to fivefold reduction. <ref name="Vittinghoff"/> Where the partner's HIV status is unknown, "Estimated per-contact risk of protected receptive anal intercourse with HIV-positive and unknown serostatus partners, including episodes in which condoms failed, was two thirds the risk of unprotected receptive anal intercourse with the comparable set of partners."<ref name="Vittinghoff"/><sup>p.&nbsp;310. </sup> . 

==Ineffective methods==. 
Most methods of contraception, except for certain forms of "[[Non-penetrative sex|outercourse]]" and the barrier methods, are not effective at preventing the spread of [[Sexually transmitted disease|STI]]s. This includes the [[birth control pills]], [[vasectomy]], [[tubal ligation]], [[Fertility awareness|periodic abstinence]] and all non-barrier methods of pregnancy prevention.  . 

The [[spermicide]] [[Nonoxynol-9]] has been claimed to reduce the likelihood of STI transmission. However, a recent study by the [[World Health Organization]] <ref>http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/publications/rhr_03_8/Nonoxynol_9.pdf</ref> has shown that Nonoxynol-9 is an irritant and can produce tiny tears in mucous membranes, which may increase the risk of transmission by offering [[pathogens]] more easy points of entry into the system. Condoms with Nonoxynol-9 lubricant do not have enough spermicide to increase contraceptive effectiveness and are not to be promoted.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} . 

The use of diaphragm or contraceptive sponge provides some women with better protection against certain sexually transmitted diseases,<ref name="TechInd">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_n19_v141/ai_12248743/ |title=Diaphragm and sponge protect against STDs - sexually transmitted diseases |accessdate=2010-04-05 | work=Science News | first=Kathy A. | last=Fackelmann | year=1992}}</ref> but they are not effective for all STIs.  . 

The hormonal protecting methods are by no means effective against transmission of STIs, even though they are more than 95% effective against unwanted pregnancies. Most common hormonal methods are the oral contraceptive pill, depoprogesterone, the vaginal ring and the patch.  . 

The copper intrauterine device and the hormonal intrauterine device provide an up to 99% protection against pregnancies but no protection against STIs. Women with copper intrauterine device present however a greater risk of being exposed to any type of STI, especially [[gonorrhea]] or [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} . 

[[Coitus interruptus]] (or "pulling out"), in which the penis is removed from the vagina, [[anus]], or [[mouth]] before [[ejaculation]], is not safe sex and can result in STI transmission. This is because of the formation of [[pre-ejaculate]], a fluid that oozes from the [[urethra]] before actual ejaculation, may contain pathogens such as HIV. <!--

==Abstinence==. 
[[Sexual abstinence]] is sometimes promoted as a way to avoid the risks associated with [[sexual contact]], though STIs may also be transmitted through non-sexual means, or by [[rape|involuntary sex]]. HIV may be transmitted through contaminated needles used in [[tattoo]]ing, [[body piercing]], or [[Injection (medicine)|injections]]. Medical or dental procedures using contaminated instruments can also spread HIV, while some health-care workers have acquired HIV through occupational exposure to accidental injuries with needles. <!--

Some groups, such as certain [[Christian]] denominations, oppose sex outside [[marriage]] and therefore object to safe-sex education programs because they believe that providing such education promotes [[promiscuity]]. [[Virginity pledge]]s and [[sexual abstinence]] education programs are often promoted in lieu of contraceptives and safe-sex education programs. This may entail exposing some [[teenagers]] to increased risk of sexually transmitted infections, because about 60 percent of teenagers who pledge [[virginity]] until marriage do engage in pre-marital sex and are then one-third less likely to use contraceptives than their peers who have received more conventional [[sex]] education. <ref>[http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/tgr/04/4/gr040401.html Recent Findings from The 'Add Health' Survey: Teens and Sexual Activity]</ref> . 

==Anal sex==. 
Unprotected [[anal sex|anal penetration]] is a high risk activity, regardless of sexual orientation. Anal sex is a higher risk activity than vaginal intercourse because the thin tissues of the anus and [[rectum]] can be easily damaged. <ref name="Dean and Delvin"/><ref>Voeller B. AIDS and heterosexual anal intercourse. Arch Sex Behav 1991; 20:233â€“276. as cited in Leichliter, Jami S. PhD, "Heterosexual Anal Sex: Part of an Expanding Sexual Repertoire?" in ''Sexually Transmitted Diseases:''

This includes by the use of anal [[sex toys|toys]]. 
Condoms may be more likely to break during anal sex than during vaginal sex, increasing the risk. <ref>{{cite web| title = Can I get HIV from anal sex? | url = http://aids.about.com/od/technicalquestions/f/oral.htm | accessdate=2011-08-19}}</ref> . 

Anal sex is practiced by many heterosexuals, as well as homosexual couples.  The anal area has many erotic nerve endings in both men and women. Because of this, many couples (heterosexual or homosexual) can derive pleasure from some form of 'bottom stimulation'. <ref name="Dean and Delvin"/>  Safety measures are required also when anal sex occurs between heterosexual partners. Apart from the STI transmission risks, other risks such as infection are high regarding anal intercourse. The main risks which individuals are exposed to when performing anal sex are the transmission of HIV, [[Hepatitis C]] and A and ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and [[HPV]].{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}  . 

Some researchers suggest that although gay men are more likely to engage in anal sex, heterosexual couples are more likely not to use condoms when doing so. <ref>"Gay men's dream: A 'magic' lube: Researchers discuss rectal microbicide development at NIAID workshop", Bob Roehr, (June 15, 2001) ''Bay Area Reporter'' [http://www.aegis.com/news/bar/2001/BR010617.html http://www.aegis.com/news/bar/2001/BR010617.html]</ref> Other researchers state that gay men are not necessarily more likely to engage in anal sex than heterosexual couples. <ref name="Dean and Delvin">{{cite web|title=Anal sex|author=Dr. John Dean and Dr. David Delvin|publisher=Netdoctor.co.uk|accessdate=April 29, 2010| url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/sexandrelationships/analsex.htm}}</ref> . 

===Precautions=== . 

Anal sex should be avoided by couples in which one of the partners has been diagnosed with an STI until the treatment has proven to be effective.  . 

In order to make anal sex safer, the couple must ensure that the anal area is clean and the bowel empty and the partner on whom anal penetration occurs should be able to relax.  Regardless of whether anal penetration occurs by using a finger or the penis, the condom is the best barrier method to prevent transmission of STI.  . 

Since the rectum can be easily damaged, the use of lubricants is highly recommended even when penetration occurs by using the finger.   Especially for beginners, using a condom on the finger is both a protection measure against STI and a lubricant source. Most condoms are lubricated and they allow less painful and easier penetration.  Oil-based lubricants damage latex and should not be used with condoms;<ref>Steiner, M., Piedrahita, C., Glover, L., Joanis, C., Spruyt, A. and Foldesy, R. (1993). The impact of lubricants on latex condoms during vaginal intercourse. International Journal of STD and AIDS, 5(1). 29-36</ref> water-based and silicone-based [[lubricant]]s are available instead.  Non-latex condoms are available for people who are allergic to latex (e.g., polyurethane condoms that are compatible with both oil-based and water-based lubricants).{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The "female condom" may also be used effectively by the anal receiving partner.  . 

Anal stimulation with a sex toy requires similar safety measures to anal penetration with a penis, in this case using a condom on the sex toy in a similar way.  . 

It is important that the man washes and cleans his penis after anal intercourse if he intends to penetrate the vagina. Bacteria from the rectum are easily transferred to the vagina, which may cause vaginal infections. <ref name="SHR">{{cite web|url=http://www.sexual-health-resource.org/anal_sex.htm#aidsanal |title=Anal Sex  - Facts and Safe Sex Information |accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref> . 

When anal-oral contact occurs, protection is required since this is a risky sexual behavior in which illnesses as Hepatitis A or STIs can be easily transmitted, as well as enteric infections. The dental dam or the plastic wrap{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} are effective protection means whenever anilingus is performed.  . 

==Sex toys==. 
Putting a condom on a [[sex toy]] provides better sexual hygiene and can help to prevent transmission of infections if the sex toy is shared, provided the condom is replaced when used by a different partner. Some sex toys are made of porous materials, and pores retain viruses and bacteria, which makes it necessary to clean sex toys thoroughly, preferably with use of cleaners specifically for sex toys. Glass sex toys are non-porous and more easily sterilized between uses.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} . 

In cases in which one of the partners is treated for an STI, it is recommended that the couple will not use sex toys until the treatment has proved to be effective.  . 

All sex toys have to be properly cleaned after use. The way in which a sex toy is cleaned varies on the type of material it is made of. Some sex toys can be boiled or cleaned in a dishwasher. Most of the sex toys come with advice on the best way to clean and store them and these instructions should be carefully followed. <ref name="NHS">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/1690.aspx?CategoryID=118&SubCategoryID=122 |title=Are sex toys safe? |accessdate=2010-03-31}}</ref>  A sex toy should be cleaned not only when it is shared with other individuals but also when it is used on different parts of the body (such as mouth, vagina or anus).  . 

A sex toy should regularly be checked for scratches or breaks that can be breeding ground for [[bacteria]]. It is best if the damaged sex toy is replaced by a new undamaged one. Even more [[hygiene]] protection should be considered by pregnant women when using sex toys. Sharing any type of sex toy that may draw [[blood]], like whips or needles, is not recommended, and is not safe. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} . 

The best way to prevent being infected or infecting someone with an STI is by using protection during sexual intercourse. <ref name="Diseases">{{cite web|url=http://www.safersextips.com/sexually-transmitted-diseases.php |title=Sexually Transmitted Diseases |accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref> .
