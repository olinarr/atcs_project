'''Natural family planning''' ('''NFP''') is a term referring to the [[family planning]] methods approved by the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. In accordance with the Church's teachings regarding [[human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]] in keeping with its philosophy of the dignity of the human person, NFP excludes the use of other methods of [[birth control]], which it refers to as "artificial contraception." . 

Periodic [[sexual abstinence|abstinence]] is the only method deemed moral by the Church for avoiding [[pregnancy]]. When used to avoid pregnancy, NFP limits sexual intercourse to naturally infertile periods; portions of the [[menstrual cycle]], during pregnancy, and after [[menopause]].  Various methods may be used to identify whether a woman is likely to be [[fertility|fertile]]; this information may be used in attempts to either  avoid or achieve pregnancy.  . 

==History==. 
===Pre-20th century===. 
Possibly the earliest Christian writing about periodic abstinence was by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]].  In the year 388, he wrote, "''Is it not you who used to counsel us to observe as much as possible the time when a woman, after her purification, is most likely to conceive, and to abstain from cohabitation at that time...?''"<!--

Augustine condemned them for their use of periodic abstinence: "''From this it follows that you consider marriage is not to procreate children, but to satiate lust.''"<ref name="augustine" /> . 

If the Manichaeans had an accurate idea of the fertile portion of the menstrual cycle, such knowledge died with them. <ref name="green">{{cite book |first=Shirley |last=Green |year=1972 |title=The Curious History of Contraception |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=0852230168 |pages=138–43}}</ref>  Documented attempts to prevent pregnancy by practicing periodic abstinence do not appear again until the mid-19th century, when various [[calendar-based method]]s were developed "by a few secular thinkers."<!--

Distributed to confessors, the ruling stated that couples who had, on their own, begun the practice of periodic abstinence—especially if they had "legitimate reasons"—were not [[sin]]ning by doing so. <ref name="cmri">{{cite web |last=Pivarunas |first=Mark A |title=On the Question of Natural Family Planning |work=cmri.org |publisher=Congregatio Mariae Reginae Immaculatae |date=February 18, 2002 |url=http://www.cmri.org/03-nfp.html |accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref> . 

In 1880, the Sacred Penitentiary reaffirmed the 1853 ruling, and went slightly further. It suggested that, in cases where the couple was already practicing artificial birth control, and could not be dissuaded to cease attempting birth regulation, the confessor might morally ''teach'' them of periodic abstinence. <ref name="cmri" /> . 

===Early 20th century===. 
In 1905 [[Theodoor Hendrik van de Velde]], a Dutch gynecologist, showed that women only ovulate once per menstrual cycle. <!--
 --><ref>{{cite web | title=A Brief History of Fertility Charting | work=FertilityFriend.com | url=http://www.fertilityfriend.com/Faqs/A_brief_history_of_fertility_charting.html | accessdate=2006-06-18}}</ref>  In the 1920s, [[Kyusaku Ogino]], a Japanese gynecologist, and Hermann Knaus, from Austria, working independently, each made the discovery that ovulation occurs about fourteen days before the next menstrual period. <!--
 --><ref name="singer">{{cite book | first=Katie | last=Singer | year=2004 | title=The Garden of Fertility | publisher=Avery, a member of Penguin Group (USA) | location=New York | isbn=1-58333-182-4 |pages=226–7}}</ref>  Ogino used his discovery to develop a formula for use in aiding infertile women to time intercourse to achieve pregnancy. <!-- This if from the Japanese article on Ogino (as best I could tell from the internet translator I used), but that page does not cite its sources --> . 

In 1930, John Smulders, a Roman Catholic physician from the Netherlands, used Knaus and Ogino's discoveries to create a method for ''avoiding'' pregnancy. Smulders published his work with the Dutch Roman Catholic medical association, and this was the official rhythm method promoted over the next several decades. <ref name="singer" /> While maintaining procreation as the primary function of intercourse, the December 1930 encyclical [[Casti Connubii]] by [[Pope Pius XI]] gave the highest form of recognition to a secondary—unitive—purpose of sexual intercourse. This encyclical stated that there was no moral stain associated with having marital intercourse at times when ''"new life cannot be brought forth."''  Although this referred primarily to conditions such as current pregnancy and menopause, the Sacred Penitentiary in yet another ruling in 1932,<!--

In 1932 a Catholic physician published a book titled ''The Rhythm of Sterility and Fertility in Women'' describing the method,<ref name="wife" /> and the 1930s also saw the first U.S. Rhythm Clinic (founded by [[John Rock (American scientist)|John Rock]]) to teach the method to Catholic couples. <!--

===Later 20th century to present===. 
<ref name="wife" />  A minority of Catholic theologians continued to doubt the morality of periodic abstinence. <ref name="cmri" /> Some historians consider two speeches delivered by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1951<!--
 --><ref>''Moral Questions Affecting Married Life'': Addresses given [http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/P511029.HTM October 29, 1951 to the Italian Catholic Union of midwives] and November 26, 1951 to the National Congress of the Family Front and the Association of Large Families, National Catholic Welfare Conference, Washington, DC. </ref> to be the first unequivocal acceptance of periodic abstinence by the Catholic Church. <ref name="wife" />  The 1950s also saw another major advance in [[fertility awareness]] knowledge: [[John Billings|Dr. John Billings]] discovered the relationship between [[cervical mucus]] and fertility while working for the Melbourne Catholic Family Welfare Bureau. Dr. Billings and several other physicians studied this sign for a number of years, and by the late 1960s had performed clinical trials and begun to set up teaching centers around the world. <!--
 --><ref>{{cite journal |last=Billings |first=John | authorlink = John Billings|title=THE QUEST&nbsp;— leading to the discovery of the Billings Ovulation Method | journal = Bulletin of Ovulation Method Research and Reference Centre of Australia | volume = 29 | issue = 1  |pages=18–28 |month=March | year=2002 |url=http://www.woomb.org/omrrca/bulletin/vol29/no1/thequest.shtml |accessdate=2007-03-18 }}</ref> . 

''[[Humanae Vitae]]'', published in 1968 by [[Pope Paul VI]], addressed a pastoral directive to scientists: "It is supremely desirable... that medical science should by the study of natural rhythms succeed in determining a sufficiently secure basis for the chaste limitation of offspring."  This is interpreted as favoring the then-new, more reliable symptoms-based [[fertility awareness]] methods over the rhythm method.  Just a few years later, in 1971, the first organization to teach a symptothermal method (one that used both mucus and temperature observations) was started.  Now called [[Couple to Couple League|Couple to Couple League International]], this organization was founded by John and Sheila Kippley, lay Catholics, along with Dr. Konald Prem. <ref name="puzzle" />  During the following decade, other now-large Catholic organizations were formed: Family of the Americas (1977), teaching the [[Billings method]],<!--
 --><ref>{{cite web |title=About us |work=Family of the Americas |year=2006 |url=http://www.familyplanning.net/main.php?parent_id=1&id_area=1 |accessdate=2007-03-18 }}</ref> and the Pope Paul VI Institute (1985), teaching a new mucus-only system called the [[Creighton Model]]. <!--

Today, use of the term ''natural family planning'' to describe calendar-based methods is considered incorrect by the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]]: it considers such methods "inaccurate". <ref>{{cite web|year=2007| title=Basic Information on Natural Family Planning| month =July |url=http://www.usccb.org/prolife/issues/nfp/information.shtml |publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops}}</ref>  Still, some organizations still consider calendar-based methods to be forms of NFP. <ref name="kippley"/>{{rp|154}}  For example, in 1999 the Institute for Reproductive Health at [[Georgetown University]] developed the Standard Days Method (SDM), which is more effective than the rhythm method. <!--

==Prevalence==. 
It is estimated that 2–3% of the world's reproductive age population relies on periodic abstinence to avoid pregnancy. <!--
 --><ref>{{cite journal |author=Che Y, Cleland J, Ali M |title=Periodic abstinence in developing countries: an assessment of failure rates and consequences |journal=Contraception |volume=69 |issue=1 |pages=15–21 |year=2004 |pmid=14720614 |doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2003.08.006}}</ref>  Breastfeeding is believed to reduce the world's fertility rate by 30–45%. <!--
 --><ref name="kippley"/>{{rp|145}} However, what portion of this population should be considered NFP users is unclear. Some Catholic sources consider couples that violate the religious restrictions associated with natural family planning to not be NFP users. <!--

There is little data on the worldwide use of natural family planning.  In Brazil, NFP is the third most popular family planning method. <!--

Use of NFP in developed countries is low, even among Catholics. While Catholics made up 24% of the U.S. population in [[2002]],<ref name="adherents">{{cite web |title=Largest Religious Groups in the United States of America |publisher=Adherents.com |year=2005 |url=http://www.adherents.com/rel_USA.html |accessdate=2007-03-19 }}</ref> of reproductive age American women using birth control, only 1.5% were using periodic abstinence. <ref name="cdc">{{cite journal | last= Chandra |first=A | coauthors = Martinez GM, Mosher WD, Abma JC, Jones J. |title=Fertility, Family Planning, and Reproductive Health of U.S. Women: Data From the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth |publisher=National Center for Health Statistics | journal = Vital Health Stat | volume = 23 | issue = 25 |year=2005 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_23/sr23_025.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-05-20 }} See Table 56. </ref> . 

Use of NFP is not restricted to Catholic couples.  In 2002, Sam and Bethany Torode, then a [[Protestantism|Protestant Christian]] couple, published a book advocating NFP use. <!--
 --><ref>{{cite book |author=Sam Torode, Bethany Torode, J. Budziszewski |title=Open Embrace: A Protestant Couple Rethinks Contraception |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan |month=March | year=2002 |isbn=0-8028-3973-8 }}</ref>  (Five years after writing the book, the Torodes retracted their advocacy of pure NFP and also supported barrier methods as moral; the couple also [[religious conversion|converted]] from Protestantism to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].)<!--

In addition, many NFP clinics and teaching organizations are not specifically associated with the Catholic Church. It has also been shared by members of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-Day-Saints]] <ref>{{cite web|last=Stanford|first=Joseph B.|title=MD, MSPH|url=http://squaretwo.org/Sq2ArticleStanfordNFP.html|publisher=SquareTwo|accessdate=7 March 2012}} </ref> and some members of the [[Muslim]] faith<ref>{{cite web|url=http://islamic-world.net/sister/h19.htm|accessdate=7 March 2012}} </ref> .  . 

==Not contraception==. 
Some proponents of NFP differentiate it from other forms of birth control by labeling them ''artificial birth control.''<ref name="saunders">{{cite web |last=Saunders |first=William |title=The Practice of Natural Family Planning |work=The Arlington Catholic Herald |publisher=Eternal Word Television Network |date=1995-10-26 |url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/ANSWERS/PRACTNFP.HTM |accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref><ref name="pfl">{{cite web |title=Birth Control and NFP: What's the Difference? |publisher=Priests for Life |year=1999 |url=http://priestsforlife.org/articles/nfpdifferences.html |accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref>  Other NFP literature holds that ''natural family planning'' is distinct from ''contraception''. <ref name="CCLcontra">{{cite web |title=NFP vs. Contraception |publisher=[[Couple to Couple League]] |year=2005 |url=http://www.ccli.org/nfp/contraception/NFPvsContraception.php |accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref><ref name="mcmanaman">{{cite web |last=McManaman |first=Doug |title=The Moral Difference Between Contraception and Natural Family Planning |publisher=LifeIssues.net |year=2004 |url=http://www.lifeissues.net/writers/mcm/mcm_04moraldifference.html |accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref><ref name="habiger">{{cite web |last=Habiger |first=Matthew |title=Is NFP "Catholic" contraception? |publisher=NFP Outreach |year=2007 |url=http://www.nfpoutreach.org/Q&A/CATHOLIC-%20CONTRACEPTION.htm |accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref> Proponents justify this classification system by saying that NFP has unique characteristics not shared by any other method of birth regulation except for abstinence.  Commonly cited traits are that NFP is "open to life,"<ref name="pfl"/><ref name="habiger"/> and that NFP alters neither the [[fertility]] of the woman nor the [[fecundity]] of a particular sex act. <ref name="CCLcontra"/><ref name="mcmanaman"/> That NFP can be used to both avoid or achieve pregnancy may also be cited as a distinguishing characteristic.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}}
Additionally, NFP differs greatly from contraception because, according to [[action theory]], NFP does not "break" the sexual act (separating the action from its purposes) in the way contraception does.  . 

==Methods==. 
There are three main types of NFP: the symptoms-based methods, the calendar-based methods, and the breastfeeding or [[lactational amenorrhea method]].  Symptoms-based methods rely on biological signs of fertility, while calendar-based methods estimate the likelihood of fertility based on the length of past menstrual cycles.  . 

According to the Couple to Couple League, "the fact that some methods of NFP can be 99% effective in the avoidance of pregnancy seems unknown to most of the general public-including many health care professionals."<ref>Couple to Couple League http://ccli.org/nfp/basics/effectiveness-p01.php</ref>  Clinical studies by the [[Guttmacher Institute]], instead, showed a much lower efficacy, with 25.3% of failures in typical use condition. <ref>http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_contr_use.html</ref> Many studies have demonstrated 99.6% effectiveness when the method was used correctly, stressing the fact that women need to clearly understand how to interpret changes in their body in order to determine fertile periods. <ref> P. Frank-Hermann, J.Heil, C. Gnoth, et al. “The effectiveness of a fertility awareness based method to avoid pregnancy in relation to a couple’s sexual behaviour during the fertile time: a prospective longitudinal study,”Human Reproduction, 2007, 1-10 </ref> A study by the World Health Organization involving 869 fertile women from Australia, India, Ireland, the Philippines, and El Salvador found that 93% could accurately interpret their body's signals regardless of education and culture. <ref> Ryder, Re.

Soc Action. 1984 Jul-September p.286-306 </ref> . 

===Symptoms-based===. 
{{main|Fertility awareness}}
Some methods of NFP track biological signs of fertility.  When used outside of the Catholic concept of NFP, these methods are often referred to simply as ''fertility awareness-based methods'' rather than NFP. <ref>{{cite book | first=Toni | last=Weschler | year=2002 | title=Taking Charge of Your Fertility | edition=Revised | publisher=HarperCollins | location=New York | isbn=0-06-093764-5 | page=5 }}</ref> The three primary signs of a woman's fertility are her [[basal body temperature]], her [[cervix|cervical]] mucus, and her cervical position. <ref>Weschler, p.52</ref> Computerized [[fertility monitor]]s may track basal body temperatures, hormonal levels in urine, changes in electrical resistance of a woman's saliva or a mixture of these symptoms. <ref>Basal body temperatures: [http://ladycompsupport.com/using_ladycomp.php FAQs on Lady-Comp temperature readings]<br />
Hormone levels in urine: [http://clearblueeasy.com/FertilityMonitor.cfm Clearblue Easy Fertility Monitor home page]<br />

Changes in electrical resistance of saliva: [http://www.zetek.net/ovacue_fertility_monitor.htm Ovacue website]</ref> . 

From these symptoms, a woman can learn to assess her fertility without use of a computerized device. Some systems use only cervical mucus to determine fertility. Two well-known mucus-only methods are the [[Billings ovulation method]] and the [[Creighton Model FertilityCare System]]. If two or more signs are tracked, the method is referred to as a symptothermal method. Two popular symptothermal systems are taught by the [[Couple to Couple League]] and the Fertility Awareness Method (FAM) taught by [[Toni Weschler]]. <ref>Unlike the organizations associated with other popular observational systems, Toni Weschler has no connection to the Roman Catholic Church. </ref>  A study completed in Germany in 2007 found that the symptothermal method has a method effectiveness of 99.6%. <ref>P. Frank-Hermann, J.Heil, C. Gnoth, et al. “The effectiveness of a fertility awareness based method to avoid pregnancy in relation to a couple’s sexual behaviour during the fertile time: a prospective longitudinal study,”Human Reproduction, 2007, 1-10</ref> . 

In Canada, the symptothermal method is taught by [http://www.serena.ca/ SERENA Canada] which is an inter-denominational organization which has been developing the Symptothermal Method as a part of NFP since 1955. They are also not specifically affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church. It is also taught by [http://www.justisse.ca/ Justisse Healthworks for Women], a pro-choice feminist organization that allows and supports women to combine other methods of birth control with their fertility awareness practice.  . 

===Calendar-based===. 
{{main|Calendar-based methods}}
Calendar-based methods determine fertility based on a record of the length of previous menstrual cycles.  They include the Rhythm Method and the Standard Days Method. The Standard Days method was developed and proven by the researchers at the Institute for Reproductive Health of Georgetown University. CycleBeads, unaffiliated with religious teachings, is a visual tool based on the Standard Days method. According to the Institute of Reproductive Health, when used as birth control, CB has a 95% effectiveness rating. iCycleBeads is the first iPhone app based on a natural family method, Standard Days. Women can plan or prevent pregnancy naturally via their iPhone or Apple brand device. <ref name="who">{{cite journal |title=Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use:Fertility awareness-based methods | version = Third edition |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2004 |url=http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/publications/mec/fab.html |accessdate=2008-04-29 }}</ref> . 

===Lactational amenorrhea===. 
{{main|Lactational amenorrhea method}}
The ''lactational amenorrhea method'' (LAM) is a method of avoiding pregnancy based on the natural [[postpartum]] [[infertility]] that occurs when a woman is [[amenorrhea|amenorrheic]] and fully [[breastfeeding]].  The rules of the method help a woman identify and possibly lengthen her infertile period. A strict version of LAM is known as ''ecological breastfeeding''. <ref>{{cite web |title=Ecological Breastfeeding |work=Couple to Couple League International |publisher=Internet Archive |year=2006 |url=http://ccli.org/nfp/ebf/summary.php |format=Internet Archive|accessdate=2008-06-04 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060111170320/ccli.org/nfp/ebf/summary.php |archivedate=2006-01-11}}</ref> . 

==Theology==. 
{{main|Christian views on contraception#Roman Catholicism}} . 

===Official Catholic===. 
Catholic doctrine holds that [[God]] created sexual intercourse to be both unitive and [[procreation|procreative]]. <!--
  --><ref name="cotcc2368">{{cite web |year=2000 | url=http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3sect2chpt2art6.htm#2363 | title =#2363-2370 | work =Catechism of the Catholic Church, Second Edition | pages =Article 6: The Sixth Commandment | publisher =United States Catholic Conference |accessdate=2006-06-15 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060424162544/http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3sect2chpt2art6.htm#2363 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-04-24}}</ref>  The Catholic Church teaches that an act which deliberately attempts to divorce the unitive and procreative meaning of the marital act is opposed to God's plan for life and love in the order of creation.  "[A]ny action which either before, at the moment of, or after sexual intercourse, is specifically intended to prevent procreation—whether as an end or as a means" is opposed to this order and is therefore forbidden according to orthodox Catholic teaching.  Thus, artificial birth control methods are forbidden, as are acts intended to end in orgasm outside the context of intercourse (e.g. masturbation or oral sex that is not part of foreplay). <!--

Engaging in marital relations at an infertile time in a woman's life (such as pregnancy or post-[[menopause]]) is also considered acceptable, since the infertile condition is considered to be created by God, rather than as an act by the couple. <!--

The Catholic Church acknowledges a potential benefit of spacing children<ref name="cotcc2368" /> and use of NFP for this reason is tolerated. ''[[Humanae Vitae]]'' cites "physical, economic, psychological and social conditions" as possibly compelling reasons to avoid pregnancy. <!--

Couples are warned, however, against using NFP for selfish, immoral, or insincere reasons. <!--

Much criticism of NFP stems from the Church's stance of NFP as the only allowable form of birth control.  In 2009, Pope [[Benedict XVI]] asserted that handing out condoms is not the solution to combating AIDS and actually makes the problem worse. <ref>[http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1012144/Condoms-'not-the-answer-to-AIDS':-Pope Condoms 'not the answer to AIDS': Pope]</ref> Some senior Catholic authorities, such as Belgian Cardinal Emeritus [[Godfried Danneels]], believe the Catholic Church should support condoms used to prevent serious diseases such as [[AIDS]], because non-use is tantamount to murder. <ref name="commonweal">{{cite journal |last=Alsan |first=Marcella |title=The Church & AIDS in Africa: Condoms & the Culture of Life | journal = Commonweal: a Review of Religion, Politics, and Culture  | volume = 133  | issue = 8 |month=April | year=2006 |url=http://www.aids.net.au/us-catholic-20060421.htm |accessdate=2006-11-28 }}</ref>  In 2003 BBC's ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' claimed that the Vatican is intentionally spreading lies that HIV can pass through the membrane of the condom. <ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/programmes/panorama/transcripts/sexandtheholycity.txt |title=Sex and the Holy City |work=[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]] |date=12 October 2003 | publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> . 

Family planning proponent [[Stephen D. Mumford]] has argued that the primary motivation behind the Church's continued opposition to contraceptive use is the Church's fear of losing papal authority if the pope were to contradict the dogma of [[papal infallibility]]. <ref>"WHY THE POPE CAN'T CHANGE THE CHURCH'S POSITION ON BIRTH CONTROL: IMPLICATIONS FOR AMERICANS, A presentation by Stephen D. Mumford DrPH [http://www.population-security.org/STLouis99.html#3]</ref> Mumford gives as an example the citation made by August Bernhard Hasler of a comment by [[Pope John Paul II]] prior to his papacy: . 

<blockquote>
If it should be declared that contraception is not evil in itself, then we should have to concede frankly that the Holy Spirit had been on the side of the Protestant churches in 1930 (when the encyclical Casti Connubii was promulgated), in 1951 (Pius XII's address to the midwives), and in 1958 (the address delivered before the Society of Hematologists in the year the pope died). It should likewise have to be admitted that for a half century the Spirit failed to protect Pius XI, Pius XII, and a large part of the Catholic hierarchy from a very serious error. This would mean that the leaders of the Church, acting with extreme imprudence, had condemned thousands of innocent human acts, forbidding, under pain of eternal damnation, a practice which would now be sanctioned. The fact can neither be denied nor ignored that these same acts would now be declared licit on the grounds of principles cited by the Protestants, which popes and bishops have either condemned or at least not approved. <ref>{{cite book |first=August Bernhard |last=Hasler |title=How the Pope Became Infallible: Pius IX and the Politics of Persuasion |publisher=Doubleday |year=1981 |notes=translation of ''Wie Der Papst Unfehlbar Wurde: Macht und Ohnmacht eines Dogmas,'' R. Piper & Co. Verlag (1979) |isbn=0385158513}}</ref>
</blockquote> . 

Theological opposition has additionally come from Protestant Christianity.  [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]]'s ''Desiring God'' ministry states of NFP, ''"There is no reason to conclude that natural family planning is appropriate but that 'artificial' means are not."''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/AskPastorJohn/ByTopic/45/1440_Does_the_Bible_permit_birth_control/ |title=Does the Bible permit birth control? |accessdate=2006-10-27 | publisher=Desiring God | year=2006 | author=Desiring God Staff | work=Questions and Answers }}</ref> Sam and Bethany Torode, former advocates of NFP-only, have redacted their position to include barrier methods and explain their current theology this way: . 

<blockquote>We also see honest congruity with the language of the body by saying "no" to conception with our bodies (via barrier methods or sensual massage) when our minds and hearts are also saying "no" to conception. We don’t believe this angers God, nor that it leads to the slippery slope of relativism or divorce. We strongly disagree with the idea that this is a mortal sin.... it’s a theological attack on women to always require that abstinence during the time of the wife’s peak sexual desire (ovulation) for the entire duration of her fertile life, except for the handful of times when she conceives. <ref name="openembrace" /></blockquote> . 

Catholics such as [[Charles Curran (theologian)|Charles Curran]] have also criticized the stance of ''Vitae'' on artificial birth control. <ref name="isbn1-58901-087-6">{{cite book |author=Curran, Charles E. |title=Loyal Dissent: Memoir of a Catholic Theologian (Moral Traditions) |publisher=Georgetown University Press |location=Washington, D.C |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=1-58901-087-6 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> .
