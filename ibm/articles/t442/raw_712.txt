The '''World Health Organization''' ('''WHO''') is a specialized agency of the [[United Nations]] (UN) that is concerned with international [[public health]]. It was established on 7 April 1948, with headquarters in [[Geneva]], Switzerland and is a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]]. Its predecessor, the Health Organization, was an agency of the [[League of Nations]].  . 

The constitution of the World Health Organization had been signed by all 61 countries of the [[United Nations]] by 22 July 1946, with the first meeting of the [[World Health Assembly]] finishing on 24 July 1948. It incorporated the ''Office International d'Hygiène Publique'' and the [[League of Nations Health Organization]]. Since its creation, WHO has been responsible for playing a leading role in the [[eradication of smallpox]]. Its current priorities include [[communicable diseases]], in particular, HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis; the mitigation of the effects of non-communicable diseases; sexual an reproductive health, development, and ageing; nutrition, food security and healthy eating; substance abuse; and drive the development of reporting, publications, and networking. WHO is responsible for the ''[[World Health Report]]'', a leading international publication on health,  the worldwide World Health Survey, and [[World Health Day]].  . 

Its links with the [[IAEA]] and distribution of [[contraception]] have both proved controversial, as have guidelines on healthy eating and the [[2009 flu pandemic]].  .

===Operational history===. 
WHO established an epidemiological information service via [[telex]] in 1947, and by 1950 a mass [[tuberculosis]] innoculation drive (using the [[BCG vaccine]]) was under way. In 1955, the malaria eradication programme was launched, although it was later altered in objective. 1965 saw the first report on [[diabetes mellitus]] and the creation of the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]]. WHO moved into its headquarters building in 1966. The [[Expanded Programme on Immunization]] was started in 1974, as was the control programme into [[onchocerciasis]] &ndash; an important partnership between the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], the [[United Nations Development Programme]], and [[World Bank]]. In the following year, the [[Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases]] was also launched. In 1976, the World Health Assembly voted to enact a resolution on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation, with a focus on community-driven care. The first list of [[essential medicines]] was drawn up in 1977, and a year later the ambitious goal of "health for all" was declared. In 1986, WHO started it global programme on the growing problem of [[HIV/AIDS]], followed two years later by additional attention on preventing discrimination against sufferers and [[UNAIDS]] was formed in 1996. The [[Global Polio Eradication Initiative]] was established in 1988. <ref name="at60">{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/who60/media/exhibition_brochure.pdf |title=WHO at 60 |format=PDF |publisher=WHO |accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref> . 

[[Image:Directors of Global Smallpox Eradication Program.jpg|thumb|Three former directors of the [[Smallpox#Eradication|Global Smallpox Eradication Programme]] read the news that smallpox had been globally eradicated, 1980]] . 

In 1958, Professor [[Viktor Zhdanov]], Deputy Minister of Health for the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], called on the [[World Health Assembly]] to undertake a global initiative to [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradicate]] smallpox, resulting in Resolution WHA11.54. <ref name= Fenner2>{{cite book |author=Fenner, Frank|title=Smallpox and Its Eradication (History of International Public Health, No. 6) |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva|year=1988 |chapter=Development of the Global Smallpox Eradication Programme |chapterurl=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106_chp9.pdf|pages=366–418 |isbn=92-4-156110-6 }}</ref> At this point, 2 million people were dying from smallpox every year.

In 1998, WHO's Director General highlighted gains in child survival, reduced infant mortality, raised life expectancy and reduced rates of "scourges" such as smallpox and [[polio]] on the fiftieth anniversary of WHO's founding.

WHO Member States appoint delegations to the [[World Health Assembly]], WHO's supreme decision-making body. All UN Member States are eligible for WHO membership, and, according to the WHO web site, "other countries may be admitted as members when their application has been approved by a simple majority vote of the World Health Assembly."<ref name="countries"/> . 

In addition, the UN observer organizations [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] have entered into "official relations" with WHO and are invited as observers. In the [[World Health Assembly]] they are seated along the other NGOs. <ref name="observerWHO"/> . 

===Assembly and Executive Board===. 
[[File:World Health Organisation building south face.jpg|thumb|WHO Headquarters in Geneva]]
The World Health Assembly is the legislative and supreme body of WHO. Based in Geneva, it typically meets yearly in May. It appoints the Director-General every five years, and votes on matters of policy and finance of WHO, including the proposed budget. It also reviews reports of the Executive Board and decides whether there are areas of work requiring further examination. The Assembly elects 34 members, technically qualified in the field of health, to the Executive Board for three-year terms. The main functions of the Board are to carry out the decisions and policies of the Assembly, to advise it and to facilitate its work. <ref name="governance">{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/governance/en/index.html |title=Governance |publisher=WHO |accessdate=5 February 2012}}</ref> .

The regional divisions of WHO were created between 1949 and 1952, and are based on article 44 of WHO's constitution, which allowed the WHA to "establish a [single] regional organization to meet the special needs of [each defined] area". Many decisions are made at regional level, including importance discussions over WHO's budget, and in deciding the members of the next assembly, which are designated by the regions. <ref name="burci53">Burci, Vignes (2004). pp. 53&ndash;57. </ref> . 

Each region has a Regional Committee, which generally meets once a year, normally in the autumn. Representatives attend from each member or associative member in each region, including those states that are not fully recognised. For example, [[Palestine]] attends meetings of the Eastern Mediterranean region. Each region also has a regional office. <ref name="burci53"/> Each Regional Office is headed by a Regional Director, who is elected by the Regional Committee. The Board must approve such appointments, although as of 2004, it had never overruled the preference of a regional committee. The exact role of the board in the process has been a subject of debate, but the practical effect has always been small. <ref name="burci53"/> Since 1999, Regional Directors serve for a once-renewable five-year term. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/gb/archive/pdf_files/WHA52/ew2.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=WHO |title=A year of change: Reports of the Executive Board on its 102nd and 103rd sessions |accessdate=11 February 2012}}</ref> . 

Each Regional Committee of the WHO consists of all the Health Department heads, in all the governments of the countries that constitute the Region. Aside from electing the Regional Director, the Regional Committee is also in charge of setting the guidelines for the implementation, within the region, of the health and other policies adopted by the [[World Health Assembly]]. The Regional Committee also serves as a progress review board for the actions of WHO within the Region.  . 

The Regional Director is effectively the head of WHO for his or her Region. The RD manages and/or supervises a staff of health and other experts at the regional offices and in specialized centres. The RD is also the direct supervising authority—concomitantly with the WHO Director-General—of all the heads of WHO country offices, known as WHO Representatives, within the Region.  .

The head of the organization is the Director-General, appointed by the [[World Health Assembly]]. <ref name="governance"/> The current Director-General is [[Margaret Chan]], who was appointed on 9 November 2006. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dg/en/ |title=Director-General |publisher=WHO |accessdate=5 February 2012}}</ref> On 18 January 2012, Chan was nominated by the WHO's Executive Board for a second term. If confirmed by the World Health Assembly in May 2012, Dr Chan will remain Director-General until the end of June 2017. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2012/dg_20120118/en/index.html |title=Dr Margaret Chan nominated for a second term to be WHO Director-General |work=WHO Media Centre |publisher=WHO |accessdate=5 February 2012}}</ref> . 

WHO employs 8,500 people in 147 countries. <ref>{{cite web|title=Employment: who we are |url= http://www.who.int/employment/about_who/en/ |publisher=WHO |accessdate=5 February 2012}}</ref>  In support of the principle of a tobacco-free work environment the WHO does not recruit cigarette smokers. <ref>{{cite web|title=Employment: who we need|url=http://www.who.int/employment/who_we_need/en/|publisher=WHO |accessdate=5 February 2012}}</ref> The organization has previously instigated the [[Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]] in 2003. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/fctc/en/index.html |title=Framework Convention on Tobacco Control |publisher=WHO |accessdate=5 February 2012}}</ref> . 

The WHO operates "[[World Health Organization Goodwill Ambassador|Goodwill Ambassadors]]", members of the arts, sport or other fields of public life aimed at drawing attention to WHO's initaitves and projects. There are currently five Goodwill Ambassadors ([[Jet Li]], [[Nancy Brinker]], [[Peng Liyuan]], [[Yohei Sasakawa]] and the [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra]]) and a further ambassador associated with a partnership project ([[Craig David]]). <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/goodwill_ambassadors/en/ |title=Goodwill Ambassador |publisher=WHO |accessdate=5 February 2012}}</ref> . 

===Country and liaison offices===. 
The World Health Organization operates 147 country offices in all its regions. <ref name="peopleandoffices">{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/about/structure/en/index.html |title=WHO – its people and offices |publisher=WHO |date=29 March 2012 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}</ref> It also operates several liaison offices, including those with the [[European Union]], [[United Nations]] and a single office covering the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]]. It also operates the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] in [[Lyons]], France, and the [[WHO Centre for Health Development]] in [[Kobe]], Japan. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/about/who_offices/en/index.html |title=WHO liaison and other offices |publisher=WHO |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> Additional offices include those in [[Pristina]]; the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza]]; the US–Mexican Border Field Office in [[El Paso]]; the Office of the Caribbean Program Coordination in [[Barbados]]; and [[Northern Micronesia]] office. <ref name="detailedinformation">{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/countryfocus/country_offices/details/en/index.html |title=Detailed information of WHO offices in countries, territories and areas |publisher=WHO |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> There will generally be one WHO country office in the capital, occasionally accompanied by satellite-offices in the provinces or sub-regions of the country in question.  . 

The country office is headed by a WHO Representative (WR). {{As of|2010}}, the only WHO Representative outside Europe to be a national of that country was for the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] ("Libya"); all other staff were international. Those in the Region for the Americas, they are referred to as PAHO/WHO Representatives. In Europe, WHO Representatives also serve as Head of Country Office, and are nationals with the exception of [[Serbia]]; there are also Heads of Country Office in [[Albania]], the [[Russian Federation]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkey]], and [[Uzbekistan]]. <ref name="detailedinformation"/> The WR is an internationally experienced physician or other health professional, not a national of that country, who holds diplomatic rank and is due privileges and immunities similar to those of an [[Ambassador|Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary]]. The WR is member of the [[UN system]] country team which is coordinated by the UN System [[Resident Coordinator]].  . 

The country office consists of the WR, and several health and other experts, both foreign and local, as well as the necessary support staff. <ref name="peopleandoffices"/> The main functions of WHO country offices include being the primary adviser of that country's government in matters of health and pharmaceutical policies. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euro.who.int/en/where-we-work/member-states/hungary/who-country-office |title=WHO Country Office (Hungary) |publisher=WHO EURO |accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref> . 

International liaison offices serve largely the same purpose as country offices, but generally on a smaller scale. These are often found in countries that want WHO presence and cooperation, but do not have the major [[health system]] flaws that require the presence of a full-blown country office. Liaison offices are headed by a liaison officer, who is a national from that particular country, and place without [[diplomatic immunity]].  . 

===Financing and partnerships===. 
The WHO is financed by contributions from member states and outside donors. {{As of|2012}}, the largest annual assessed contributions from member states came from the United States ($110&nbsp;million), Japan ($58&nbsp;million), Germany ($37&nbsp;million), United Kingdom ($31&nbsp;million) and France ($31&nbsp;million). <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/about/resources_planning/2012_2013_AC_summary.pdf |title=Assessed Contributions payable by Member States and Associate Members &ndash; 2012&ndash;2013 |publisher=WHO |format=PDF |accessdate=26 March 2012}}</ref> The combined 2012&ndash;2013 budget has proposed a total expenditure of $3,959&nbsp;million, of which $944&nbsp;million (24%) will come from assessed contributions. This represented a significant fall in outlay compared to the previous 2009&ndash;2010 budget, adjusting to take account of previous underspends. Assessed contributions were kept the same. Voluntary contributions will account for $3,015&nbsp;million (76%), of which $800&nbsp;million is regarded as highly or moderately flexible funding, with the remainder tied to particular programmes or objectives. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/pb/2012-2013/PB_2012%E2%80%932013_eng.pdf |title=Programme Budget, 2012&ndash;2013|publisher=WHO |format=PDF |accessdate=26 March 2012 |pages=10, 15&ndash;16}}</ref> . 

In recent years, the WHO's work has involved increasing collaboration with external bodies. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/civilsociety/documents/en/RevreportE.pdf |title=WHO’s interactions with Civil Society and Nongovernmental Organizations |publisher=WHO |work=WHO/CSI/2002/WP6 |date=2002 |accessdate=31 March 2012 |page=2}}</ref> {{As of|2002}}, a total of 473 NGOs had some form of partnership with WHO. There were 189 partnerships with international [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) in formal "official relations" &ndash; the rest being considered informal in character. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/civilsociety/documents/en/RevreportE.pdf |title=WHO’s interactions with Civil Society and Nongovernmental Organizations |publisher=WHO |work=WHO/CSI/2002/WP6 |date=2002 |accessdate=31 March 2012 |page=10}}</ref> Partners include the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/livingproofproject/Pages/gavi.aspx |title=Living Proof Project: Partner Profile |publisher=Bill & Melinda Gates Foundations |accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref> and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/what-we-do/current-work/transforming-health-systems/grants-grantees/world-health-oganizations-alliance |title=World Health Organization's Alliance for Health Systems and Policy Research |publisher=Rockefeller Foundation |accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref> . 

==Controversies==. 
=== IAEA – Agreement WHA 12–40 ===. 
[[File:Devant OMS 5.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Demonstration on [[Chernobyl disaster]] day near WHO in [[Geneva]]]]
In 1959, the WHO signed Agreement WHA 12–40 with the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), which somehave claimed prevents the WHO from independently researching the [[Acute radiation syndrome|effects on human health of radiation]] caused by the use of [[nuclear power]], for examples after [[Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents|nuclear disasters]] in [[Chernobyl nuclear disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Fukushima nuclear disaster|Fukushima]]. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://independentwho.org/fr/ |title=Independent WHO |language=French |publisher=Pour l'indépendance de l'OMS |accessdate=27 March 2012}}</ref>  The agreement states that the WHO recognises the IAEA as having responsibility for peaceful nuclear energy without prejudice to the roles of the WHO of promoting health. However, the following paragraph adds: "whenever either organization proposes to initiate a programme or activity on a subject in which the other organization has or may have a substantial interest, the first party shall consult the other with a view to adjusting the matter by mutual agreement."<ref>{{cite web|last=World Health Organization|title=Agreements with Other Intergovernmental Organizations|url=http://apps.who.int/gb/bd/PDF/BDenglish/Agreements.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=19 April 2011}}</ref> The nature of this statement has led some pressure groups and activists to believe that the WHO is restricted in its ability to investigate events and prevent further catastrophes, and thus believe WHO must regain what they see as "independence". <ref>{{cite web|last=Independence for WHO|title=Appeal by Health Professionals for Independence of the World Health Organization|url=http://www.ippnw-europe.org/commonFiles/pdfs/Atomenergie/appeal_healthprofessionals.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Women in Europe for a Common Future|title=Open letter on the WHO/IAEA Agreement of 1959|url=http://www.wecf.eu/download/2010/04/letterIAEA-WHO.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.activistmagazine.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=703 |title=World Health Organization Accomodates Atomic Agency |date=3 June 2007 |publisher=Activist Magazine |accessdate=27 March 2012}}</ref> . 

===Condom promotion, religion and AIDS===. 
{{Main|Roman Catholic Church and AIDS}}
In 2003, the WHO denounced the [[Roman Curia]]'s health department's opposition to the use of [[condom]]s, saying: "These incorrect statements about condoms and HIV are dangerous when we are facing a global pandemic which has already killed more than 20&nbsp;million people, and currently affects at least 42&nbsp;million."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/oct/09/aids |title=Vatican: condoms don't stop Aids |publisher=The Guardian |date=9 October 2003}}</ref> {{As of|2009}}, the Catholic Church remains opposed to increasing the use of contraception to combat HIV/AIDS. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/17/pope-africa-condoms-aids |title=Pope claims condoms could make African Aids crisis worse |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 March 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref> At the time, the World Health Assembly President, [[Guyana]]'s Health Minister [[Leslie Ramsammy]], condemned Pope Benedict's call, saying he was trying to "create confusion" and "impede" proven strategies in the battle against the disease. <ref>{{cite |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hsk4RI5cPLSsvXTY9ZEyWSMrVElg |title=World Health Assembly: Pope Benedict "wrong" |publisher=[[AFP]] |date=21 March 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref> . 

===Intermittent preventive therapy===. 
The aggressive support of the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]] for [[intermittent preventive therapy]] of [[malaria]] which included the commissioning of a report from the [[Institute of Medicine]] triggered a memo from the former WHO malaria chief Dr. Akira Kochi. <ref>{{cite web|last=Mcneil |first=Donald G. |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/16/science/16malaria.html |title=New York Times, 16 February 2008 Gates Foundation’s Influence Criticized By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr |work=The New York Times |date=16 February 2008 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}</ref> Dr. Kochi wrote, “although it was less and less straightforward that the health agency should recommend IPTi, the agency’s objections were met with intense and aggressive opposition from Gates-backed scientists and the foundation”.  . 

===Diet and sugar intake===. 
Some of the research undertaken or supported by WHO to determine how people's lifestyles and environments are influencing whether they live in better or worse health can be controversial, as illustrated by a 2003 joint WHO/FAO report on nutrition and the prevention of chronic [[non-communicable disease]],<ref>Report of a Joint FAO/WHO Consultation. ''Diet, nutrition and the prevention of chronic diseases''. Geneva: World Health Organization;
2003 (WHO Technical Report Series 916). </ref> which recommended that sugar should form no more than 10% of a [[healthy diet]]. This report led to lobbying by the sugar industry against the recommendation, to which the WHO/FAO responded by including in the report the statement "The Consultation recognized that a population goal for free sugars of less than 10% of total energy is controversial", but also stood by its recommendation based upon its own analysis of scientific studies. <ref>Mann J. [http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/81/8/editorial2.pdf "Sugar revisited – again."] ''Bulletin of the World Health Organization'' 2003, 81(8). </ref><ref>[http://forum.lowcarber.org/archive/index.php/t-100479.html U.N. sticks to advice to limit sugar intake; against threats from sugar industry.] Posted by Active Low-Carber Forums, 22 April 2003. </ref> . 

===2009 influenza pandemic===. 
{{Main|2009 flu pandemic}}
In 2007, the WHO organized work on pandemic [[influenza vaccine]] development through [[clinical trial]]s in collaboration with many experts. A pandemic involving the H1N1 influenza virus was declared by Director-General [[Margaret Chan]] in April 2009.  . 

By the post-pandemic period critics claimed the WHO had exaggerated the danger, spreading "fear and confusion" rather than "immediate information". <ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36421914/ ''WHO admits errors in handling flu pandemic: Agency accused of overplaying danger of the virus as it swept the globe.''] Posted by msnbc.com</ref> Industry experts countered that the 2009 pandemic had led to "unprecedented collaboration between [[global health]] authorities, scientists and manufacturers, resulting in the most comprehensive pandemic response ever undertaken, with a number of vaccines approved for use three months after the pandemic declaration. This response was only possible because of the extensive preparations undertaken in during the last decade."<ref>Abelina A et al. [http://www.evm-vaccines.org/IMG/pdf/Lessons_from_pandemic_influenza.pdf "Lessons from pandemic influenza A(H1N1): The research-based vaccine industry’s perspective."] ''Vaccine'' 29 (2011) 1135–1138. </ref> .
