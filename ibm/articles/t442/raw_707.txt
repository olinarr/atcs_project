A '''condom''' ({{IPAc-en|us|ˈ|k|ɒ|n|d|əm}} or {{IPAc-en|uk|ˈ|k|ɒ|n|d|ɒ|m}}) is a [[Barrier contraception|barrier device]] most commonly used during [[sexual intercourse]] to reduce the probability of [[pregnancy]] and spreading [[sexually transmitted diseases]] (STDs—such as [[gonorrhea]], [[syphilis]], and [[HIV]]). It is put on a man's erect [[penis]] and physically blocks ejaculated semen from entering the body of a sexual partner. Because condoms are waterproof, elastic, and durable, they are also used in a variety of secondary applications. These include collection of semen for use in infertility treatment as well as non-sexual uses such as creating waterproof microphones and protecting rifle barrels from clogging.  . 

In the modern age, condoms are most often made from [[latex]], but some are made from other materials such as [[polyurethane]], [[polyisoprene]], or lamb intestine. A [[female condom]] is also available, most often made of [[nitrile]].  . 

As a method of [[birth control]], male condoms have the advantage of being inexpensive, easy to use, having few side effects, and of offering protection against sexually transmitted diseases. With proper knowledge and application technique—and use at every act of intercourse—women whose partners use male condoms experience a 2% per-year pregnancy rate with perfect use and a 15% per-year pregnancy rate with typical use. <ref name="Summary table of contraceptive efficacy">{{cite article| last=Trussell| first=J| title=Contraceptive efficacy | publisher=Ardent Media | date=2007 | accessdate=2011-03-13 | url=http://www.contraceptivetechnology.org/table.html}}</ref> . 

Condoms have been used for at least 400 years. Since the 19th century, they have been one of the most popular methods of contraception in the world. While widely accepted in modern times, condoms have generated some controversy, primarily over what role they should play in [[sex education]] classes. They are considered unacceptable in almost all situations by certain religions, notably the [[Catholic_teachings_on_sexual_morality#Use_of_condoms|Catholic church]].  . 

== History ==. 
[[File:De Morbo Gallico.jpg|thumb|A page from ''De Morbo Gallico'' (The French Disease), Gabriele Falloppio's treatise on syphilis. Published in 1564, it describes what is possibly the first use of condoms.]]
{{main|History of condoms}} . 

=== Before the 19th century ===. 
Whether condoms were used in ancient civilizations is debated by archaeologists and historians. <ref name="collier">{{cite book | first=Aine | last=Collier | year=2007 | title=The Humble Little Condom: A History | publisher=Prometheus Books | location=Amherst, NY | isbn=978-1-59102-556-6}}</ref>{{Rp|11}} In ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, pregnancy prevention was generally seen as a woman's responsibility, and the only well documented contraception methods were female-controlled devices. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|17,23}} In Asia before the 15th century, some use of [[glans]] condoms (devices covering only the head of the penis) is recorded. Condoms seem to have been used for contraception, and to have been known only by members of the upper classes. In China, glans condoms may have been made of oiled silk paper, or of lamb intestines. In Japan, they were made of tortoise shell or animal horn. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|60-1}} . 

In 16th century Italy, [[Gabriele Falloppio]] wrote a treatise on [[syphilis]]. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|51,54-5}} The earliest documented strain of syphilis, first appearing in Europe in a 1490s outbreak, caused severe symptoms and often death within a few months of contracting the disease. <ref name=Scars_of_Venus>{{cite book | author=Oriel, JD | title=The Scars of Venus: A History of Venereology | location=London | publisher= Springer-Verlag | year=1994 |isbn=0-387-19844-X}}</ref><ref name=Diamond1>{{cite book | author=Diamond, Jared | year=1997 | title=Guns, Germs and Steel | location=New York | publisher=W.W.

The cloths he described were sized to cover the [[Glans penis|glans]] of the penis, and were held on with a ribbon. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|51,54-5}}<ref name=pai>{{cite web |title=Special Topic: History of Condom Use |publisher=Population Action International |year=2002 |url=http://www.populationaction.org/Publications/Reports/Condoms_Count/Special_Topic_History_of_Condom_Use.shtml |accessdate=2008-02-18}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Falloppio claimed that an experimental trial of the linen sheath demonstrated protection against syphilis. <ref name="youssef">{{cite journal|last=Youssef |first=H |date=1 April 1993|title=The history of the condom | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 86 |pages=226–228 | accessdate=2008-06-03 | pmid = 7802734|issue=4|pmc=1293956}}</ref> . 

After this, the use of penis coverings to protect from disease is described in a wide variety of literature throughout Europe. The first indication that these devices were used for birth control, rather than disease prevention, is the 1605 theological publication ''De iustitia et iure'' (On justice and law) by Catholic theologian [[Leonardus Lessius]], who condemned them as immoral. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|56}} In 1666, the English Birth Rate Commission attributed a recent downward fertility rate to use of "condons", the first documented use of that word (or any similar spelling). <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|66-8}} . 

[[File:Condom 1900.jpg|left|thumb|A condom made from animal intestine circa 1900.]]
In addition to linen, condoms during the [[Renaissance]] were made out of intestines and bladder. In the late 15th century, Dutch traders introduced condoms made from "fine leather" to Japan. Unlike the horn condoms used previously, these leather condoms covered the entire penis. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|61}} . 

[[File:Condoomgebruik in de 19e eeuw.png|right|thumb|170px|[[Giacomo Casanova]] tests his condom for holes by inflating it.]]
[[Giacomo Casanova|Casanova]] in the 18th century was one of the first reported using "assurance caps" to prevent impregnating his mistresses. <ref>Fryer P. (1965) 'the Birth controllers', London: Secker and Warburg and Dingwall EJ. (1953) 'Early contraceptive sheaths' BMJ, Jan 1: 40-1 in Lewis M. 'A Brief history of condoms' in Mindel A. (2000) 'Condoms', BMJ books</ref>  . 

From at least the 18th century, condom use was opposed in some legal, religious, and medical circles for essentially the same reasons that are given today: condoms reduce the likelihood of pregnancy, which some thought immoral or undesirable for the nation; they do not provide full protection against sexually transmitted infections, while belief in their protective powers was thought to encourage sexual promiscuity; and, they are not used consistently due to inconvenience, expense, or loss of sensation. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|73,86-8,92}} . 

Despite some opposition, the condom market grew rapidly. In the 18th century, condoms were available in a variety of qualities and sizes, made from either linen treated with chemicals, or "skin" (bladder or intestine softened by treatment with [[sulfur]] and [[lye]]). <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|94-5}} They were sold at pubs, barbershops, chemist shops, open-air markets, and at the theater throughout Europe and Russia. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|90-2,97,104}} They later spread to America, although in every place there were generally used only by the middle and upper classes, due to both expense and lack of sex education. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|116-21}} . 

=== 1800 through 1920s ===. 
The early 19th century saw contraceptives promoted to the poorer classes for the first time. Writers on contraception tended to prefer other methods of birth control. Feminists of this time period wanted birth control to be exclusively in the hands of women, and disapproved of male-controlled methods such as the condom. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|129,152-3}} Other writers cited both the expense of condoms and their unreliability (they were often riddled with holes, and often fell off or broke), but they discussed condoms as a good option for some, and as the only contraceptive that also protected from disease. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|88,90,125,129-30}}  . 

Many countries passed laws impeding the manufacture and promotion of contraceptives. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|144,163-4,168-71,193}} In spite of these restrictions, condoms were promoted by traveling lecturers and in newspaper advertisements, using euphemisms in places where such ads were illegal. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|127,130-2,138,146-7}} Instructions on how to make condoms at home were distributed in the United States and Europe. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|126,136}} Despite social and legal opposition, at the end of the 19th century the condom was the Western world's most popular birth control method. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|173-4}} . 

[[File:Surgeon Sage Says.jpg|left|thumb|During World War I, the U.S. military was the only one that did not promote condom use. Posters such as these were intended to promote abstinence.]]
Beginning in the second half of the 19th century, American rates of sexually transmitted diseases skyrocketed. Causes cited by historians include effects of the [[American Civil War]], and the ignorance of prevention methods promoted by the [[Comstock laws]]. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|137-8,159}} To fight the growing epidemic, sex education classes were introduced to public schools for the first time, teaching about venereal diseases and how they were transmitted. They generally taught that abstinence was the only way to avoid sexually transmitted diseases. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|179-80}} Condoms were not promoted for disease prevention because the medical community and moral watchdogs considered STDs to be punishment for sexual misbehavior. The stigma against victims of these diseases was so great that many hospitals refused to treat people who had syphilis. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|176}} . 

The German military was the first to promote condom use among its soldiers, beginning in the later 19th century. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|169,181}} Early 20th century experiments by the American military concluded that providing condoms to soldiers significantly lowered rates of sexually transmitted diseases. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|180-3}} During [[World War I]], the United States and (at the beginning of the war only) Britain were the only countries with soldiers in Europe who did not provide condoms and promote their use. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|187-90}} . 

In the decades after World War I, there remained social and legal obstacles to condom use throughout the U.S. and Europe. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|208-10}} Founder of psychoanalysis [[Sigmund Freud]] opposed all methods of birth control on the grounds that their failure rates were too high. Freud was especially opposed to the condom because he thought it cut down on sexual pleasure. Some feminists continued to oppose male-controlled contraceptives such as condoms. In 1920 the Church of England's [[Lambeth Conferences#Sixth Conference (1920)|Lambeth Conference]] condemned all "unnatural means of conception avoidance." London's Bishop [[Arthur Winnington-Ingram]] complained of the huge number of condoms discarded in alleyways and parks, especially after weekends and holidays. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|211-2}}  . 

However, European militaries continued to provide condoms to their members for disease protection, even in countries where they were illegal for the general population. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|213-4}} Through the 1920s, catchy names and slick packaging became an increasingly important marketing technique for many consumer items, including condoms and cigarettes. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|197}} Quality testing became more common, involving filling each condom with air followed by one of several methods intended to detect loss of pressure. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|204,206,221-2}} Worldwide, condom sales doubled in the 1920s. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|210}} . 

=== Rubber and manufacturing advances ===. 
In 1839, [[Charles Goodyear]] discovered a way of processing natural [[rubber]], which is too stiff when cold and too soft when warm, in such a way as to make it elastic. This proved to have advantages for the manufacture of condoms; unlike the sheep's gut condoms, they could stretch and did not tear quickly when used. The [[vulcanized rubber|rubber vulcanization]] process was patented by Goodyear in 1844. <ref>{{cite journal |last=Reprinted from ''India Rubber World'' |title=CHARLES GOODYEAR—The life and discoveries of the inventor of vulcanized India rubber | journal = Scientific American Supplement | issue = 787 |publisher=Munn & Co.  |location=New York  |date= 1891-01-31 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14009 |accessdate=2008-06-08}}<br />

Besides this type, small rubber condoms covering only the [[glans]] were often used in England and the United States. There was more risk of losing them and if the rubber ring was too tight, it would constrict the penis. This type of condom was the original "capote" (French for condom), perhaps because of its resemblance to a woman's bonnet worn at that time, also called a [[Bonnet (headgear)|capote]].  . 

For many decades, rubber condoms were manufactured by wrapping strips of raw rubber around penis-shaped molds, then dipping the wrapped molds in a chemical solution to cure the rubber. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|148}} In 1912, Polish inventor [[Julius Fromm]] developed a new, improved manufacturing technique for condoms: dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution. <ref name="billy" /> Called ''cement dipping'', this method required adding gasoline or benzene to the rubber to make it liquid. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|200}} [[Latex]], rubber suspended in water, was invented in 1920. Latex condoms required less labor to produce than cement-dipped rubber condoms, which had to be smoothed by rubbing and trimming. The use of water to suspend the rubber instead of [[gasoline]] and [[benzene]] eliminated the fire hazard previously associated with all condom factories. Latex condoms also performed better for the consumer: they were stronger and thinner than rubber condoms, and had a shelf life of five years (compared to three months for rubber). <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|199-200}}  . 

Until the twenties, all condoms were individually hand-dipped by semiskilled workers. Throughout the decade of the 1920s, advances in the automation of the condom assembly line were made. The first fully automated line was patented in 1930. Major condom manufacturers bought or leased conveyor systems, and small manufacturers were driven out of business. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|201-3}} The skin condom, now significantly more expensive than the latex variety, became restricted to a niche high-end market. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|220}} . 

=== 1930 to present ===. 
In 1930 the Anglican Church's [[Lambeth Conferences#Seventh Conference (1930)|Lambeth Conference]] sanctioned the use of birth control by married couples. In 1931 the [[National Council of Churches|Federal Council of Churches]] in the U.S. issued a similar statement. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|227}} The Roman Catholic Church responded by issuing the encyclical ''[[Casti Connubii]]'' affirming its opposition to all contraceptives, a stance it has never reversed. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|228-9}} . 

In the 1930s, legal restrictions on condoms began to be relaxed. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|216,226,234}}<ref name="note">{{cite web |title=Biographical Note |work=The Margaret Sanger Papers |publisher=Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College, Northampton, Mass. |year=1995 |url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss43_bioghist.html |accessdate=2006-10-21 }}</ref> But during this period [[Italian fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]] increased restrictions on condoms (limited sales as disease preventatives were still allowed). <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|252,254-5}} During the Depression, condom lines by Schmid gained in popularity. Schmid still used the cement-dipping method of manufacture which had two advantages over the latex variety. Firstly, cement-dipped condoms could be safely used with oil-based [[Personal lubricant|lubricants]]. Secondly, while less comfortable, these older-style rubber condoms could be reused and so were more economical, a valued feature in hard times. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|217-9}} More attention was brought to quality issues in the 1930s, and the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] began to regulate the quality of condoms sold in the United States. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|223-5}} . 

Throughout [[World War II]], condoms were not only distributed to male U.S. military members, but also heavily promoted with films, posters, and lectures. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|236-8,259}} European and Asian militaries on both sides of the conflict also provided condoms to their troops throughout the war, even Germany which outlawed all civilian use of condoms in 1941. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|252-4,257-8}} In part because condoms were readily available, soldiers found a number of [[#Other uses|non-sexual uses]] for the devices, many of which continue to this day.  . 

After the war, condom sales continued to grow. From 1955–1965, 42% of Americans of reproductive age relied on condoms for birth control. In Britain from 1950–1960, 60% of married couples used condoms. The [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]] became the world's most popular method of birth control in the years after its 1960 début, but condoms remained a strong second. The U.S. [[United States Agency for International Development|Agency for International Development]] pushed condom use in developing countries to help solve the "world population crises": by 1970 hundreds of millions of condoms were being used each year in India alone. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|267-9,272-5}} (This number has grown in recent decades: in 2004, the government of India purchased 1.9 billion condoms for distribution at family planning clinics.)<ref>{{cite journal | first = AP | last = Sharma | title = Annual Report of the Tariff Commission | page = 9 | publisher = India government | year = 2006 | url = http://tc.nic.in/areports/annualreport-2005-06.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2009-07-16}}</ref> . 

In the 20th century the invention of plastic and other man-made materials did not lead to an improvement in the quality of condoms. However the deterioration of the rubber became less rapid. Condoms became not only thinner but also more reliable. In 1995, plastic condoms went on the market in the USA.  . 

In the 1960s and 1970s quality regulations tightened,<ref>Collier, pp. 267, 285</ref> and more legal barriers to condom use were removed. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|276-9}} In Ireland, legal condom sales were allowed for the first time in 1978. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|329-30}} Advertising, however was one area that continued to have legal restrictions. In the late 1950s, the American [[National Association of Broadcasters]] banned condom advertisements from national television: this policy remained in place until 1979. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|273-4,285}} . 

After learning in the early 1980s that [[AIDS]] can be a sexually transmitted infection,<ref>{{cite journal |title=A Cluster of Kaposi's Sarcoma and Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia among Homosexual Male Residents of Los Angeles and range Counties, California | journal = Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report | volume = 31 | issue = 23 |pages=305–7 |publisher= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date= 1982-06-18 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001114.htm |accessdate=2008-06-15 |pmid=6811844 |author1=Centers for Disease Control (CDC)}}</ref> the use of condoms was encouraged to prevent transmission of [[HIV]]. Despite opposition by some political, religious, and other figures, national condom promotion campaigns occurred in the U.S. and Europe. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|299,301,306-7,312-8}} These campaigns increased condom use significantly. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|309-17}} . 

Due to increased demand and greater social acceptance, condoms began to be sold in a wider variety of retail outlets, including in supermarkets and in discount department stores such as [[Wal-Mart]]. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|305}} Condom sales increased every year until 1994, when media attention to the AIDS pandemic began to decline. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|303-4}} The phenomenon of decreasing use of condoms as disease preventatives has been called ''prevention fatigue'' or ''[[condom fatigue]]''.

== Etymology and other terms ==. 
The term ''condom'' first appears in the early 18th century. Its etymology is unknown. 
In popular tradition, the invention and naming of the condom came to be attributed to an associate of England's [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], one "Dr. Condom" or "Earl of Condom". There is however no evidence of the existence of such a person, and condoms had been used for over one hundred years before King Charles II ascended to the throne. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|54,68}} . 

A variety of unproven Latin etymologies have been proposed, including ''condon'' (receptacle),<!--

== Varieties == . 

Most condoms have a reservoir tip or teat end, making it easier to accommodate the man's ejaculate. Condoms come in different sizes, from oversized to snug and they also come in a variety of surfaces intended to stimulate the user's partner. Condoms are usually supplied with a [[Personal lubricant|lubricant]] coating to facilitate penetration, while flavored condoms are principally used for oral sex. As mentioned above, most condoms are made of latex, but [[#Synthetic|polyurethane]] and [[#Lambskin|lambskin]] condoms are also widely available.  .

==== Synthetic ====. 
The most common non-latex condoms are made from [[polyurethane]]. Condoms may also be made from other synthetic materials, such as [[AT-10 resin]], and most recently [[polyisoprene]]. <ref name="isoprenepr">{{cite press release | title = Lifestyles Condoms Introduces Polyisoprene Non-latex | publisher = HealthNewsDigest.com | date = 2008-07-31 | url = http://healthnewsdigest.com/news/New_Product_460/Lifestyles_Condoms_printer.shtml | accessdate = 2008-08-24}}</ref> . 

Polyurethane condoms tend to be the same width and thickness as latex condoms, with most polyurethane condoms between 0.04&nbsp;mm and 0.07&nbsp;mm thick. <ref>{{cite web |title=Condoms |work=Condom Statistics and Sizes |date=2008-03-12 |url=http://www.condomman.com/articles/condom-use/all-you-need-to-know-on-condom-statistics-and-sizes/ |accessdate=2008-03-12 }} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  . 

Polyurethane can be considered better than latex in several ways: it conducts heat better than latex, is not as sensitive to temperature and ultraviolet light (and so has less rigid storage requirements and a longer shelf life), can be used with oil-based [[Personal lubricant|lubricants]], is less allergenic than latex, and does not have an odor. <ref name="nonlatex">{{cite journal |title=Nonlatex vs Latex Condoms: An Update | journal = The Contraception Report | volume = 14 | issue = 2 |publisher=Contraception Online |month=September | year=2003 |url=http://www.contraceptiononline.org/contrareport/article01.cfm?art=243 |accessdate=2006-08-14 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060926035226/http://www.contraceptiononline.org/contrareport/article01.cfm?art=243 |archivedate = September 26, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Polyurethane condoms have gained [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approval for sale in the United States as an effective method of contraception and HIV prevention, and under laboratory conditions have been shown to be just as effective as latex for these purposes. <ref name="AlicePolyLatex">{{cite web |title=Are polyurethane condoms as effective as latex ones? |publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]] |date=February 22, 2005 |url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/1842.html |accessdate=2007-05-25 }}</ref> .

==== Lambskin ====. 
Condoms made from [[sheep]] [[intestine]]s, labeled "lambskin", are also available. Although they are generally effective as a contraceptive by blocking sperm, they have been clinically shown to be less effective than latex in preventing the transmission of agents that cause [[Sexually transmitted disease|STDs]], because of pores in the material. <ref>{{cite book |author=Boston Women's Health Book Collective |title=Our Bodies, Ourselves: A New Edition for a New Era |publisher=Touchstone |location=New York, NY |year=2005 |isbn=0-7432-5611-5 |page=333}}</ref> Lambskin provides a more natural sensation and are less allergenic than latex, but because of their lesser protection against infection, other hypoallergenic materials such as [[polyurethane]] are recommended for latex-allergic users and/or partners. Lambskin condoms are also significantly more expensive than other types.  . 

=== Spermicidal ===. 
Some latex condoms are lubricated at the manufacturer with a small amount of a [[nonoxynol-9]], a [[spermicide|spermicidal chemical]]. According to [[Consumer Reports]], condoms lubricated with spermicide have no additional benefit in preventing pregnancy, have a shorter shelf life, and may cause [[urinary tract infection|urinary-tract infections]] in women. <!--

=== Textured ===. 
[[Image:Red studed.jpg|thumbnail|Red studded condom on glans penis]]
Textured condoms include studded and ribbed condoms which can provide extra sensations to both partners. The studs or ribs can be located on the inside, outside, or both; alternatively, they are located in specific sections to provide directed stimulation to either the [[g-spot]] or [[Frenulum of prepuce of penis|frenulum]]. Many textured condoms which advertise "mutual pleasure" also are bulb-shaped at the top, to provide extra stimulation to the male. <ref name="about">{{cite web |title=Condom Types: A look at different condom styles |url=http://contraception.about.com/od/malecondom/tp/CondomTypes.htm |last=Stacey |first=Dawn |author1=http://contraception.about.com/bio/Dawn-Stacey-M-Ed-LMHC-24387.htm |accessdate=2008-12-08}}</ref> Some women experience irritation during vaginal intercourse with studded condoms.  . 

===Boosting condom===.

In a double blind test the boosting condom gave a significant proportion that it was better than a standard condom which increased the penis size and longer lasting sexual experience for women. The boosting condom used gel in its tips that dilates the arteries and increased blood flow to penis make a firmer and bigger erection. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/20/us-futura-condom-odds-idUSTRE75J45X20110620?feedType=RSS&feedName=oddlyEnoughNews&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FoddlyEnoughNews+%28News+%2F+US+%2F+Oddly+Enough%29 | work=Reuters | first=Paul | last=Sandle | title=Erection-boosting condom gets EU backing | date=2011-06-20}}</ref> . 

===Adolescent and teenage condoms===. 
In March 2010, the Swiss Government announced that it was planning to promote smaller condoms intended for boys of 12–14 years old following concern about the pregnancy rate among adolescent girls, and also about the potential spread of AIDS among this age group. This was due to the fact that standard condoms were too wide and consequently failed to afford protection to adolescent boys during vaginal and anal intercourse. Family planning groups and the Swiss Aids Federation had campaigned to have a narrower condom produced for adolescent use after a number of studies, including a government study researched at the Centre for Development and Personality Psychology at Basel University, found that standard condoms were unsuitable for boys in this age range, and that the condoms either failed during use or that the boys rejected them altogether because they were too wide, and consequently they used no protection at all. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7361181/Extra-small-condoms-for-12-year-old-boys-go-on-sale-in-Switzerland.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Extra small condoms for 12 year-old boys go on sale in Switzerland                 Extra small condoms for boys as young as 12 are going on sale in Switzerland. | first=Alexandra | last=Williams | date=2010-03-03 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref> . 

As a result of these studies, a condom aimed at 12 to 14 year old boys is now produced and is available in Switzerland and in certain other countries. Manufactured by Ceylor, the 'Hotshot' is a lubricated, teat-ended latex condom which is narrower than a standard condom and has a tight band at the opening to ensure that it remains on the boy's penis during intercourse. A standard condom has a diameter of 2&nbsp;inches (5.2&nbsp;cm) whereas the Hotshot has a diameter of 1.7&nbsp;inches (4.5&nbsp;cm). Both are the same length– 7.4&nbsp;inches (19&nbsp;cm).  . 

In a German study of 12,970 13 to 19-year-olds, a quarter of the boys surveyed also said a standard condom was too large. Other manufacturers, such as Durex, also produce smaller than average condoms such as Durex Love which is aimed at this end of the teenage market.  . 

=== Other ===. 
The [[Anti-rape device|anti-rape condom]] is another variation designed to be worn by women. It is designed to cause pain to the attacker, hopefully allowing the victim a chance to escape. <ref>{{cite web |title=Rape-aXe: Questions and answers |publisher=Rape-aXe |year=2006 |url=http://www.antirape.co.za/questions.htm |accessdate=2009-08-13}}</ref> . 

A [[#Infertility treatment|collection condom]] is used to collect semen for fertility treatments or sperm analysis. These condoms are designed to maximize sperm life.  . 

Some condom-like devices are intended for entertainment only, such [[novelties|novelty]] condoms may not provide protection against pregnancy and STDs. <ref name="planned parenthood"/> . 

== Female condom ==. 
[[File:Préservatif féminin.jpg|thumb|right|Female condom]]
{{main|Female condom}} . 

Male condoms have a tight ring to form a seal around the penis while female condoms typically have a large stiff ring to keep them from slipping into the [[body orifice]]. The Female Health Company produced a female condom that was initially made of polyurethane, but newer versions are made of [[nitrile rubber|nitrile]]. Medtech Products produces a female condom made of latex. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/female-condom.htm|title=The Female Condom|publisher=AVERT|accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref> .

{{see also|Comparison of birth control methods#Effectiveness of various methods|l1=Comparison of birth control methods: Effectiveness of various methods}}
The effectiveness of condoms, as of most forms of [[birth control|contraception]], can be assessed two ways. ''Perfect use'' or ''method'' effectiveness rates only include people who use condoms properly and consistently. ''Actual use'', or ''typical use'' effectiveness rates are of all condom users, including those who use condoms incorrectly or do not use condoms at every act of intercourse.

Condoms are widely recommended for the prevention of [[sexually transmitted diseases]] (STDs). They have been shown to be effective in reducing infection rates in both men and women. While not perfect, the condom is effective at reducing the transmission of organisms that cause [[AIDS]], [[Herpes genitalis|genital herpes]], [[cervical cancer]], [[genital wart]]s, [[syphilis]], [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[gonorrhea]], and other diseases. <ref name="planned parenthood">{{cite web |title=Condom |publisher=Planned Parenthood | year=2008 |url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/condom-10187.htm |accessdate=2007-11-19 }}</ref> Condoms are often recommended as an adjunct to more effective birth control methods (such as [[IUD]]) in situations where STD protection is also desired. <ref name=DualProtection>{{cite journal|author=Cates, W., Steiner, M.

According to a 2000 report by the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), correct and consistent use of latex condoms reduces the risk of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] transmission by approximately 85% relative to risk when unprotected, putting the seroconversion rate (infection rate) at 0.9 per 100 person-years with condom, down from 6.7 per 100 person-years. <!--

Although a condom is effective in limiting exposure, some disease transmission may occur even with a condom. Infectious areas of the genitals, especially when symptoms are present, may not be covered by a condom, and as a result, some diseases can be transmitted by direct contact. <ref>{{cite web |last=Villhauer |first=Tanya |title=Condoms Preventing HPV? |publisher=University of Iowa Student Health Service/Health Iowa |date=2005-05-20 |url=http://www.uistudenthealth.com/question/default.aspx?q=738 |accessdate=2009-07-26 }}</ref> The primary effectiveness issue with using condoms to prevent STDs, however, is inconsistent use. <ref name="badnews" /> . 

Condoms may also be useful in treating potentially [[cervical cancer|precancerous cervical changes]].

Among people who intend condoms to be their form of birth control, pregnancy may occur when the user has sex without a condom. The person may have run out of condoms, or be traveling and not have a condom with them, or simply dislike the feel of condoms and decide to "take a chance." This type of behavior is the primary cause of typical use failure (as opposed to method or perfect use failure). <ref>{{cite journal |author=Steiner, M; Cates, W; Warner, L |title=The real problem with male condoms is nonuse | journal = Sex Transm Dis | volume = 26 | issue = 8 |pages=459–62 |year=1999 | pmid = 10494937 | doi = 10.1097/00007435-199909000-00007}}</ref> .

== Prevalence ==. 
The prevalence of condom use varies greatly between countries. Most surveys of contraceptive use are among married women, or women in informal unions. Japan has the highest rate of condom usage in the world: in that country, condoms account for almost 80% of contraceptive use by married women. On average, in developed countries, condoms are the most popular method of birth control: 28% of married contraceptive users rely on condoms. In the average less-developed country, condoms are less common: only 6-8% of married contraceptive users choose condoms. <!--

== Use ==. 
[[File:CondomUse2 alternative.jpg|thumb|How to put on a condom]]
Male condoms are usually packaged inside a foil wrapper, in a rolled-up form, and are designed to be applied to the tip of the penis and then unrolled over the [[erection|erect]] penis. It is important that some space be left in the tip of the condom so that semen has a place to collect; otherwise it may be forced out of the base of the device. After use, it is recommended the condom be wrapped in tissue or tied in a knot, then disposed of in a trash receptacle. <ref name="AliceDisposal" /> . 

Some couples find that putting on a condom interrupts sex, although others incorporate condom application as part of their foreplay. Some men and women find the physical barrier of a condom dulls sensation. Advantages of dulled sensation can include prolonged erection and delayed ejaculation; disadvantages might include a loss of some sexual excitement. <ref name="planned parenthood" /> Advocates of condom use also cite their advantages of being inexpensive, easy to use, and having few side effects. <ref name="planned parenthood" /><ref name="fwhc">{{cite web |title=Male Condom |publisher=Feminist Women's Health Center  |date=October 18, 2007 |url=http://www.fwhc.org/birth-control/condom.htm |accessdate=2007-11-19 }}</ref> . 

=== Role in sex education ===. 
Condoms are often used in [[sex education]] programs, because they have the capability to reduce the chances of pregnancy and the spread of some sexually transmitted diseases when used correctly. A recent [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) press release supported the inclusion of information about condoms in sex education, saying "''comprehensive sexuality education programs... discuss the appropriate use of condoms''", and "''promote condom use for those who are sexually active''."<!--

In the United States, teaching about condoms in public schools is opposed by some religious organizations. <!--

=== Infertility treatment {{anchor|Infertility treatment}} ===. 
<!-- [[Conception device]] links to anchor Infertility treatment -->
Common procedures in [[infertility]] treatment such as [[semen analysis]] and [[Artificial insemination|intrauterine insemination]] (IUI) require collection of semen samples. These are most commonly obtained through [[masturbation]], but an alternative to masturbation is use of a special ''collection condom'' to collect semen during sexual intercourse.  . 

Collection condoms are made from silicone or polyurethane, as latex is somewhat harmful to sperm. Many men prefer collection condoms to masturbation, and some religions prohibit masturbation entirely. Also, compared with samples obtained from masturbation, semen samples from collection condoms have higher total sperm counts, sperm motility, and percentage of sperm with normal morphology. For this reason, they are believed to give more accurate results when used for semen analysis, and to improve the chances of pregnancy when used in procedures such as intracervical or intrauterine [[Artificial insemination|insemination]]. <!--

For fertiltiy treatments, a collection condom may be used to collect semen during [[sexual intercourse]] where the semen is provided by the woman's partner. Private sperm donors may also use a collection condom to obtain samples through masturbation or by [[sexual intercourse]] with a partner and will transfer the ejaculate from the collection condom to a specially designed container. The sperm is transported in such containers, in the case of a donor, to a recipient woman to be used for insemination, and in the case of a woman's partner, to a fertility clinic for processing and use. However, transportation may reduce the fecundity of the sperm. Collection condoms will not be used where semen is produced at a sperm bank or fertility clinic.  . 

''Condom therapy'' is sometimes prescribed to infertile couples when the female has high levels of antisperm antibodies. The theory is that preventing exposure to her partner's semen will lower her level of antisperm antibodies, and thus increase her chances of pregnancy when condom therapy is discontinued. However, condom therapy has not been shown to increase subsequent pregnancy rates. <!--

* In [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[gulag]]s, condoms were used to smuggle alcohol into the camps by prisoners who worked outside during daylight.

The smuggler would then use a [[syringe]] to fill the tubing and condom with up to three [[liter]]s of raw alcohol, which the prisoner would then smuggle back into the camp. When back in the barracks, the other prisoners would suspend him upside down until all the spirit had been drained out. [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] records that the three liters of raw fluid would be diluted to make seven liters of crude [[vodka]], and that although such prisoners risked an extremely painful and unpleasant death if the condom burst inside them, the rewards granted them by other prisoners encouraged them to run the risk. <ref>{{cite book |author=Applebaum, Anne |title=Gulag : A History |publisher=Anchor |location=Garden City, N.Y. |year=2004 |page=482 |isbn=1-4000-3409-4}}</ref>

== Debate and criticism ==. 
There do exist some criticisms of condoms both on the [[moral]] level and on the [[scientific]] level despite the many proven benefits of condoms by [[scientific consensus]] and sexual health experts, particularly over the last century when direct and concentrated research on condoms has increased.  . 

===Criticism within sexual situations===. 
{{Unreferenced section|date=October  2011}}
Condom criticism is not limited to external parties; sometimes the very people who use them have problems with them as well. An entirely subjective but still potentially notable criticism sometimes levelled at the male condom by partners, especially [[heterosexual]] partners, who are actually engaging in sexual activity while using them, has in recent history consisted of an aggregate of the following general ideas, or some combination thereof: . 

* "Condoms are too heavy", i.e., their material significantly decreases sensation both in the [[penis]] and in the ability of the [[vagina]]'s walls to properly feel the penis, because of the material barrier. In general, this complaint has been responded to by condom manufacturers via the production of "thin" and even "ultra-thin" condom types; however, even the "thin" types are sometimes claimed by men or women (or both) to not "feel as good" as [[sexual intercourse]] without a condom.  . 

* Some men genuinely cannot properly maintain an [[erection]] while a condom is on, even if they always are able to do so during sexual play without a condom. There are those who claim that men who experience this problem simply need to "train themselves" to maintain erections while attempting intercourse with a condom (such as by [[masturbating]] while wearing a condom, and other strategies), but some of these men counter that they are physically unable to do so regardless of how much they try.  . 

* Some men can properly maintain an erection but cannot [[ejaculate]] with a condom on. This has the potential of defeating the purpose of using the condom in the first place, considering its main purpose during sexual intercourse is to prevent passage of [[semen]] into the vagina, and taking the condom off just before ejaculating essentially invalidates that purpose. A potential 'opposite' strategy, i.e. stimulating the penis to near-orgasm without a condom and then hurriedly applying the condom at the last possible moment before ejaculation, is typically either logistically impossible or prone to some other type of failure.  . 

* [[Sociology|Sociologically]], the desire not to use condoms is sometimes culturally seen among [[post-feminist]] condom-accepting cultures as occurring almost exclusively in men rather than women; as involving 'male' perspectives; and as being essentially a personal aversion to condom use among males, while their female partners always or almost-always want to use condoms, at least by comparison. However, this view fails to take into account the reality that some women, on their own and from their own views, do not want to use condoms. Common justifications among such women include the idea that sexual intercourse without a condom is more [[sexual intimacy|intimate]]; that sex without a condom is "uninterrupted" whereas sex with a condom takes "work" and ruins [[sexual arousal|the mood]]; and perhaps more importantly, that sex with a condom either feels significantly less pleasurable or even actively irritates their vaginal walls and leaves the vagina sore and/or irritated whereas condomless sex does not.  .

{{see also|Catholic teachings on sexual morality#Use of condoms|l1=Catholic teachings on sexual morality: Use of condoms}}
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] opposes all sexual acts outside of marriage, as well as any sexual act in which the chance of successful conception has been reduced by [[direct and intentional]] acts (for example, [[Human sterilization|surgery to prevent conception]]) or foreign objects (for example, condoms). <ref>{{cite web|title=Humanæ Vitæ |author=[[Pope Paul VI]] |date=1968-07-25 |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html |accessdate=2009-07-23}}</ref> . 

The use of condoms to prevent STD transmission is not specifically addressed by Catholic doctrine, and is currently a topic of debate among theologians and high-ranking Catholic authorities.

More generally, some scientific researchers have expressed objective concern over certain ingredients sometimes added to condoms, notably [[talc]] and [[nitrosamine]]s.

In addition, the large-scale use of disposable condoms has resulted in concerns over their environmental impact via [[littering]] and in [[landfills]], where they can eventually wind up in [[wildlife]] environments if not [[incinerated]] or otherwise permanently disposed of first. Polyurethane condoms in particular, given they are a form of [[plastic]], are not [[biodegradable]], and latex condoms take a very long time to break down. Experts, such as [[AVERT]], recommend condoms be disposed of in a garbage receptacle, as flushing them down the toilet (which some people do) may cause plumbing blockages and other problems. <ref name="AliceDisposal">{{cite web |title=Environmentally-friendly condom disposal |publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]] |date=December 20, 2002 |url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/2311.html |accessdate=2007-10-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/condom.htm |title=Using Condoms, Condom Types & Condom Sizes |publisher=AVERT |accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref> The plastic and foil wrappers condoms are packaged in are also not biodegradable. However, the benefits condoms offer are widely considered to offset their small landfill mass. <ref name="AliceDisposal" /> Frequent condom or wrapper disposal in public areas such as a parks have been seen as a persistent litter problem. <ref name="power">{{cite web |last=Power |first=Robert |title=The black plastic bag of qualitative research | work = BMJ.com |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/318/7175/48#1918 |accessdate=2007-12-02}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> . 

While biodegradable,<ref name="AliceDisposal" /> latex condoms damage the environment when disposed of improperly. According to the Ocean Conservancy, condoms, along with certain other types of trash, cover the [[coral reef]]s and smother [[sea grass]] and other bottom dwellers. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] also has expressed concerns that many animals might mistake the litter for food. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hightower |first1=Eve |last2=Hall |first2=Phoebe |title=Clean sex, wasteful computers and dangerous mascara – Ask E | journal = [[E - The Environmental Magazine]] |date=March–April 2003 |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1594/is_2_14/ai_98469962 |accessdate=2007-10-28 }}</ref> . 

===Health problems===. 
Condoms may interfere with the process of [[paternal tolerance]], by which exposure of a woman's immune system to semen during unprotected sex may decrease the risk of [[pregnancy complications]] in subsequent pregnancies. <ref name=NewScientist>{{cite news | last=Fox | first=Douglas | title=Gentle Persuasion | publisher=The New Scientist | date=2002-02-09 | accessdate=2007-06-17 | url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17323294.200-gentle-persuasion.html}}</ref> . 

The use of latex condoms by people with an allergy to latex can cause allergic symptoms such as skin irritation. In people with severe latex allergies, using a latex condom can potentially be life-threatening. Repeated use of latex condoms can also cause some people to develop an allergy to latex.  . 

== Cultural barriers to condom use ==. 
In much of the [[Western world]], the introduction of [[combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]] in the 1960s was associated with a decline in condom use. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|267-9,272-5}} In [[Japan]], oral contraceptives were not approved for use until September 1999, and even then access was more restricted than in other industrialized nations. <!--
  --><ref name="cbs">{{cite news |author=Hayashi, Aiko |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/08/20/health/main637523.shtml |title=Japanese Women Shun The Pill |publisher=CBS News |date=2004-08-20 |accessdate=2006-06-12}}</ref> Perhaps because of this restricted access to hormonal contraception, Japan has the highest rate of condom usage in the world: in 2008, 80% of contraceptive users relied on condoms. <ref name="factsheet"/> . 

Cultural attitudes toward [[gender roles]], [[contraception]], and [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] vary greatly around the world, and range from extremely conservative to extremely liberal. But in places where condoms are misunderstood, mischaracterised, demonised, or looked upon with overall cultural disapproval, the prevalence of condom use is directly affected. In less-developed countries and among less-educated populations, misperceptions about how disease transmission and conception work negatively affect the use of condoms; additionally, in cultures with more traditional gender roles, women may feel uncomfortable demanding that their partners use condoms.  . 

As an example, [[Latino]] immigrants in the [[United States]] often face cultural barriers to condom use. A study on female HIV prevention published in the ''Journal of Sex Health Research'' asserts that Latino women often lack the attitudes needed to negotiate safe sex due to traditional gender-role norms in the Latino community, and may be afraid to bring up the subject of condom use with their partners. Women who participated in the study often reported that because of the general [[machismo]] subtly encouraged in Latino culture, their male partners would be angry or possibly [[domestic violence|violent]] at the woman's suggestion that they use condoms. <ref>{{cite journal |last=Gomez |first=Cynthia A |year=1996 |title=Gender, Culture, and Power: Barriers to HIV-Prevention Strategies for Women |journal=The Journal of Sex Research |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=355–362 |author2=Marín |doi=10.1080/00224499609551853 |jstor=3813287}}</ref> A similar phenomenon has been noted in a survey of low-income [[African-American|American black]] women; the women in this study also reported a fear of violence at the suggestion to their male partners that condoms be used. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kalichman |first1=SC |last2=Williams |first2=EA |last3=Cherry |first3=C |last4=Belcher |first4=L |last5=Nachimson |first5=D |date=April 1998 |title=Sexual coercion, domestic violence, and negotiating condom use among low-income African American women |journal=Journal of Women's Health |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=371–378 |url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=ENV&recid=4306315 |doi=10.1089/jwh.1998.7.371}}</ref> . 

Perhaps even more troubling is the apparent fact of a telephone survey conducted by [[Rand Corporation]] and [[Oregon State University]] and published in the ''[[Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes]]'' that showed that belief in [[AIDS conspiracy theories]] among United States black men is linked to rates of condom use. As conspiracy beliefs about AIDS grow in a given sector of these black men, consistent condom use drops in that same sector. Female use of condoms, interestingly, was not similarly affected. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://sexualhealth.e-healthsource.com/?p=news1&id=523594|title=AIDS Conspiracy Theory Belief Linked to Less Condom Use|last=Dotinga|first=Randy|publisher=SexualHealth.com|accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref> . 

In the African continent, condom promotion in some areas has been impeded by anti-condom campaigns by some Muslim<ref name="northeast kenya"/> and Catholic clerics. <ref name="catholicafrica"/> Among the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] in [[Tanzania]], condom use is hampered by an aversion to "wasting" sperm, which is given sociocultural importance beyond reproduction. Sperm is believed to be an "elixir" to women and to have beneficial health effects. Maasai women believe that, after conceiving a child, they must have sexual intercourse repeatedly so that the additional sperm aids the child's development. Frequent condom use is also considered by some Maasai to cause impotence. <ref>{{cite journal |last=Coast |first=Ernestina |year=2007 |title=Wasting semen: context and condom use among the Maasai |journal=Culture, health, and sexuality |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/2502/1/Wasting_semen-context_and_condom_use_among_the_Maasai(LSERO).pdf |accessdate=2009-07-26}}</ref> Some women in Africa believe that condoms are "for prostitutes" and that respectable women should not use them. <ref name="northeast kenya">{{cite web|url=http://www.plusnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=74336|title=Muslim opposition to condoms limits distribution |date=Sept. 17, 2007|publisher=PlusNews|accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref> A few clerics even promote the idea that condoms are deliberately laced with HIV. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/pius-kamau/islam-condoms-and-aids_b_120418.html |title=Islam, Condoms and AIDS |last=Kamau |first=Pius |date=August 24, 2008 |publisher=The Huffington Post |accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref> . 

== Major manufacturers ==.

One analyst described the size of the condom market as something that "boggles the mind". Numerous small manufacturers, nonprofit groups, and government-run manufacturing plants exist around the world. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|322,328}} Within the condom market, there are several major contributors, among them both for-profit businesses and philanthropic organizations. Most large manufacturers have ties to the business that reach back to the end of the 19th century. 
* Julius Schmid, Inc. was founded in 1882 and began the Sheik and Ramses brands of condoms. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|154-6}} The London Rubber Company began manufacturing latex condoms in 1932, under the [[Durex]] brand. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|199,201,218}} Both companies are now part of [[SSL International|Seton Scholl Limited]]. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|327}}
* Youngs Rubber Company, founded by Merle Youngs in late 19th century America, introduced the [[Trojan (condoms)|Trojan]] line of condoms<ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|191}} now owned by [[Church and Dwight]]. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|323-4}}
* [[Dunlop Rubber]] began manufacturing condoms in Australia in the 1890s. In 1905, Dunlop sold its condom-making equipment to one of its employees, Eric Ansell, who founded [[Ansell Limited|Ansell Rubber]]. In 1969, Ansell was sold back to Dunlop. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|327}} In 1987, English business magnate [[Richard Branson]] contracted with Ansell to help in a campaign against HIV and AIDS. Ansell agreed to manufacture the Mates brand of condom, to be sold at little or no profit in order to encourage condom use. Branson soon sold the Mates brand to Ansell, with royalty payments made annually to the charity [[Virgin Unite]]. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|309,311}}<ref>The Healthcare Foundation, started by [[Virgin Group]], changed names in 2004. </ref> In addition to its Mates brand, Ansell currently manufactures Lifestyles for the U.S. market. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|333}}
* In 1934 the Kokusia Rubber Company was founded in Japan. It is now known as the Okamoto Rubber Manufacturing Company. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|257}}
* In 1970 Tim Black and [[Phil Harvey|Philip Harvey]] founded Population Planning Associates (now known as [[Adam & Eve (business)|Adam & Eve]]). Population Planning Associates was a mail-order business that marketed condoms to American college students. Black and Harvey used the profits from their company to start a non-profit organization [[Population Services International]],<ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|286-7,337-9}} and Harvey later also founded another nonprofit company, [[DKT International]], that annually sells millions of condoms at discounted rates in developing countries around the world. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|286-7,337-9}} .

A [[spray-on condom]] made of latex is intended to be easier to apply and more successful in preventing the transmission of diseases.

The Invisible Condom, developed at [[Université Laval]] in Québec, Canada, is a gel that hardens upon increased temperature after insertion into the vagina or rectum. In the lab, it has been shown to effectively block HIV and herpes simplex virus. The barrier breaks down and liquefies after several hours. As of 2005, the invisible condom is in the clinical trial phase, and has not yet been approved for use. <!-- --><ref>{{cite web |title=Safety, Tolerance and Acceptability Trial of the Invisible Condom in Healthy Women |work=ClinicalTrials.gov |publisher=U.S. National Institutes of Health |month=August | year=2005 |url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/gui/show/NCT00136643?order=6 |accessdate=2006-08-14 }}</ref> . 

Also developed in 2005 is a condom treated with an erectogenic compound. The drug-treated condom is intended to help the wearer maintain his erection, which should also help reduce slippage. If approved, the condom would be marketed under the Durex brand. As of 2007, it was still in clinical trials. <ref name="collier"/>{{Rp|345}} In 2009, Ansell Healthcare, the makers of Lifestyle condoms, introduced the X2 condom lubricated with "Excite Gel" which contains the amino acid l-arginine and is intended to improve the strength of the erectile response.
