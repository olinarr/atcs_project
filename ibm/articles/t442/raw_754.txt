'''Benedict XVI''' ({{lang-la|Benedictus PP. XVI}}; {{lang-it|Benedetto XVI}}; {{lang-de|Benedikt XVI.}}; born '''Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger''' on 16&nbsp;April&nbsp;1927) is the [[List of popes|265th]] and current [[Pope]],<ref>The precise number of popes has been a matter for scholarly debate for centuries.

==Overview==. 
[[File:Pope Benedictus XVI january,20 2006 (2) mod.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pope Benedict XVI at a private audience on 20 January 2006]]
Benedict XVI was [[Papal election|elected]] Pope at the age of 78. He is the [[List of ages of Popes|oldest person to have been elected Pope]] since [[Pope Clement XII]] (1730–40). He had served longer as a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] than any Pope since [[Pope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] (1724–30). He is the ninth [[List of German popes|German Pope]], the eighth having been the Dutch-German [[Pope Adrian VI]] (1522–23) from [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. The last Pope named Benedict was [[Pope Benedict XV|Benedict XV]], an Italian who reigned from 1914 to 1922, during World War I (1914–18).  . 

Born in 1927 in [[Marktl]], Bavaria, Germany, Ratzinger had a distinguished career as a university [[theology|theologian]] before being appointed [[Archbishop of Munich and Freising]] by [[Pope Paul VI]] (1963–78). Shortly afterwards, he was made a cardinal in the [[consistory]] of 27 June 1977. He was appointed Prefect of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] by Pope John Paul II in 1981 and was also assigned the honorific title of the [[cardinal bishop of Velletri-Segni]] on 5 April 1993. In 1998, he was elected sub-dean of the [[College of Cardinals]]. On 30 November 2002, he was elected dean, taking, as is customary, the title of cardinal bishop of the suburbicarian diocese of [[Bishop of Ostia|Ostia]]. He was the first Dean of the College elected Pope since [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]] (1555–59) and the first [[cardinal bishop]] elected Pope since [[Pope Pius VIII|Pius VIII]] (1829–30).  . 

Even before becoming Pope, Ratzinger was one of the most influential men in the [[Roman Curia]], and was a close associate of John Paul II. As Dean of the College of Cardinals, he presided over the [[funeral of John Paul II]] and over the Mass immediately preceding the 2005 conclave in which he was elected. During the service, he called on the assembled cardinals to hold fast to the doctrine of the faith. He was the public face of the church in the ''[[sede vacante]]'' period, although, technically, he ranked below the ''[[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Camerlengo]]'' in administrative authority during that time. Like his predecessor, Benedict XVI affirms traditional Catholic doctrine.  . 

In addition to his native German, Benedict speaks French and Italian fluently. He also has a very good command of Latin and speaks English and Spanish adequately. Furthermore, he has some knowledge of Portuguese. He can read [[Ancient Greek]] and biblical [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. <ref>{{cite web| publisher=[[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] | title=Pope Benedict XVI: Quick Facts | url=http://www.usccb.org/comm/popebenedictxvi/benedictfacts.shtml | accessdate=4 November 2007}}</ref> He has stated that his first foreign language is French. He is a member of several scientific academies, such as the French ''[[Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Académie des sciences morales et politiques]]''. He plays the piano and has a preference for [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]. <ref name="Willey">{{Cite news|last=Willey |first=David |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4539613.stm |title=Pope Benedict's creature comforts |publisher=BBC News  |date=13 May 2005 |accessdate=2 February 2010}}  [http://www.webcitation.org/5wunc7C2y  WebCitation archive]</ref> . 

==Early life: 1927–51==.

<!-- Due to the size of the overall article, please consider whether it would be more appropriate to add any additional information to the larger article on the early life of Pope Benedict XVI rather than this one. -->
Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger was born on 16 April, [[Holy Saturday]], 1927, at Schulstraße 11, at 8:30 in the morning in his parents' home in [[Marktl]], Bavaria, Germany. He was baptised the same day. He was the third and youngest child of [[Joseph Ratzinger, Sr.]], a police officer, and Maria Ratzinger (née Peintner). His mother's family was originally from [[South Tyrol]] (now in Italy).{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Pope Benedict XVI's brother, [[Georg Ratzinger]], a priest and former director of the [[Regensburger Domspatzen]] choir, is still alive. His sister, Maria Ratzinger, who never married, managed Cardinal Ratzinger's household until her death in 1991. Their grand-uncle was the German politician [[Georg Ratzinger (politician)|Georg Ratzinger]].  . 

At the age of five, Ratzinger was in a group of children who welcomed the visiting [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising|Cardinal Archbishop of Munich]] with flowers. Struck by the cardinal's distinctive garb, he later announced the very same day that he wanted to be a cardinal.  . 

Ratzinger attended the elementary school in [[Aschau am Inn]], which was renamed in his honour in 2009. <ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.innsalzach24.de/waldkraiburg/grundschule-aschau-papst-name-einweihung-is24-397132.html | title="Papst-Schule" eingeweiht

Thus, following repatriation in 1945, the two brothers entered Saint Michael Seminary in Traunstein, later studying at the [[Ducal Georgianum]] (''Herzogliches Georgianum'') of the [[Ludwig-Maximilian University]] in Munich. They were both ordained in [[Freising]] on 29 June 1951 by Cardinal [[Michael von Faulhaber]] of Munich. Ratzinger recalled:
<blockquote>
...at the moment the elderly Archbishop laid his hands on me, a little bird – perhaps a lark – flew up from the altar in the high cathedral and trilled a little joyful song. <ref>{{Cite book| title=Milestones: Memoirs 1927–1977 | page=99 | publisher=[[Ignatius Press]]| year=1998 |language=German| isbn=978-0-89870-702-1 | author=Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger |author2=Erasmo Leiva-Merikakis (translator)}}</ref>
</blockquote> . 

Ratzinger's 1953 dissertation was on [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] and was titled ''The People and the House of God in Augustine's Doctrine of the Church''. His ''[[Habilitation]]'' (which qualified him for a professorship) was on [[Bonaventure]]. It was completed in 1957 and he became a professor of [[Freising]] College in 1958.  . 

==Pre-papal career==. 
===Academic career: 1951–77===. 
Ratzinger became a professor at the [[University of Bonn]] in 1959; his inaugural lecture was on "The God of Faith and the God of Philosophy". In 1963, he moved to the [[University of Münster]].  . 

During this period, Ratzinger participated in the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962–65). Ratzinger served as a ''[[peritus]]'' (theological consultant) to [[Josef Frings|Cardinal Frings of Cologne]]. He was viewed during the time of the Council as a reformer, cooperating with theologians like [[Hans Küng]] and [[Edward Schillebeeckx]]. Ratzinger became an admirer of [[Karl Rahner]], a well-known academic theologian of the [[Nouvelle Théologie]] and a proponent of church reform.  . 

In 1966, Ratzinger was appointed to a chair in dogmatic theology at the [[University of Tübingen]], where he was a colleague of [[Hans Küng]]. In his 1968 book ''Introduction to Christianity'', he wrote that the pope has a duty to hear differing voices within the Church before making a decision, and he downplayed the centrality of the papacy. During this time, he distanced himself from the atmosphere of Tübingen and the [[Marxism|Marxist]] leanings of the student movement of the 1960s that quickly radicalised, in the years 1967 and 1968, culminating in a series of disturbances and riots in April and May 1968. Ratzinger came increasingly to see these and associated developments (such as decreasing respect for authority among his students) as connected to a departure from traditional Catholic teachings. <ref name="sobene">{{Cite news| first=David | last=Van Biema | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1053658,00.html| title=The Turning Point | publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''| date=24 April 2005 | accessdate=7 October 2011}} [http://www.webcitation.org/62GwP8zAN WebCitation archive]</ref> Despite his reformist bent, his views increasingly came to contrast with the liberal ideas gaining currency in theological circles. <ref>{{Cite news| first1=Daniel J. | last1=Wakin | first2=Richard| last2=Bernstein | first3=Mark | last3=Landler |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/24/international/worldspecial2/24ratzinger.html?position=&incamp=article_popular_5&pagewanted=print&position= | title=Turbulence on Campus in 60's Hardened Views of Future Pope |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=24 April 2005 | accessdate=8 June 2005}} [http://www.webcitation.org/62HbkldsN WebCitation archive]</ref> . 

Some voices, among them Hans Küng, deem this a turn towards conservatism, while Ratzinger himself said in a 1993 interview, "I see no break in my views as a theologian [over the years]". <ref>{{Cite news| publisher=''Time'' | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979775-1,00.html | title=Keeper of the Straight and Narrow | last=Ostling | first=Richard N. | last2=Moody | first2=John | last3=Morris | first3=Nomi | date=6 December 1993 | accessdate=10 July 2009}} [http://www.webcitation.org/62HcTzmdm WebCitation archive]</ref> Ratzinger has continued to defend the work of the Second Vatican Council, including ''[[Nostra Aetate]],'' the document on respect of other religions, [[ecumenism]] and the declaration of the right to [[freedom of religion]]. Later, as the [[Prefect for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], Ratzinger most clearly spelled out the Catholic Church's position on other religions in the 2000 document ''[[Dominus Iesus]]'' which also talks about the Roman Catholic way to engage in "[[Catholic Church and ecumenism|ecumenical]] dialogue".  . 

During his years at Tübingen University, Ratzinger published articles in the reformist theological journal ''[[Concilium (journal)|Concilium]]'', though he increasingly chose less reformist themes than other contributors to the magazine such as Hans Küng and [[Edward Schillebeeckx]].  . 

In 1969, he returned to Bavaria, to the [[University of Regensburg]]. He founded the theological journal ''[[Communio]]'', with [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]], [[Henri de Lubac]], [[Walter Kasper]] and others, in 1972. ''Communio'', now published in seventeen languages, including German, English and Spanish, has become a prominent journal of contemporary Catholic theological thought. Until his election as Pope, he remained one of the journal's most prolific contributors. In 1976, he suggested that the [[Augsburg Confession]] might possibly be recognised as a Catholic statement of faith. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dulles, s.j.|first=Avery| month=October|year=1983 |title=The Catholicity of the Augsburg Confession|journal=[[The Journal of Religion]]|volume=63|issue=4|pages=337–354|doi=10.1086/487060|authorlink=Avery Dulles|jstor=1203403}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| last1 = Fahlbusch | first1 = Erwin|first2=Geoffrey William |last2= Bromiley |first3=David B. |last3= Barrett | chapter=Evangelical Catholicity|title = The Encyclopedia of Christianity | publisher=Wm.

===Archbishop of Munich and Freising: 1977–82===. 
[[File:Palais Holnstein Munich.JPG|thumb|right|[[Palais Holnstein]] in Munich, the residence of Benedict as Archbishop of Munich and Freising]]
On 24 March 1977, Ratzinger was appointed [[Archdiocese of Munich and Freising|Archbishop of Munich and Freising]]. He took as his episcopal motto ''Cooperatores Veritatis'' (Co-workers of the Truth) from [[Third Epistle of John|3 John]] 8, a choice he comments upon in his autobiographical work, ''Milestones''. 
In the [[consistory]] of the following 27 June, he was named [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal-Priest]] of ''[[Santa Maria Consolatrice al Tiburtino]]'' by [[Pope Paul VI]]. By the time of the 2005 Conclave, he was one of only 14 remaining cardinals appointed by Paul VI, and one of only three of those under the age of 80. Of these, only he and [[William Wakefield Baum]] took part in the conclave. <ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0502405.htm | publisher=[[Catholic News Service]] |  first=John | last=Thavis | first2=Cindy | last2=Wooden | title=Cardinal Ratzinger, guardian of church doctrine, elected 265th pope | date=19 April 2005 | accessdate=17 July 2009}} [http://www.webcitation.org/62HcvDKc8 WebCitation archive]</ref> . 

===Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith: 1981–2005===. 
{{Main|Joseph Ratzinger as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith}} . 

On 25 November 1981, Pope John Paul II named Ratzinger as the Prefect of the [[Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], formerly known as the "Sacred Congregaton of the [[Holy Office]]", the historical [[Inquisition]]. Consequently, he resigned his post at Munich in early 1982. He was promoted within the [[College of Cardinals]] to become [[Bishop of Velletri-Segni|Cardinal Bishop of Velletri-Segni]] in 1993 and  was made the college's vice-dean in 1998 and dean in 2002.  . 

Ratzinger defended and reaffirmed Catholic doctrine, including teaching on topics such as [[birth control]], homosexuality, and inter-religious dialogue. The theologian [[Leonardo Boff]], for example, was suspended, while others were censured. Other issues also prompted condemnations or revocations of rights to teach: for instance, some posthumous writings of [[Jesuit]] priest [[Anthony de Mello (Jesuit)|Anthony de Mello]] were the subject of a "notification". Ratzinger and the congregation viewed many of them, particularly the later works, as having an element of religious indifferentism (''i.e.'', Christ was "one master alongside others"). In particular, ''[[Dominus Iesus]]'', published by the congregation in the jubilee year 2000, reaffirmed many recently "unpopular" ideas, including the Catholic Church's position that "Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved." The document angered many Protestant churches by claiming that they are not actually churches, but "ecclesial communities". <ref>[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20000806_dominus-iesus_en.html ''Dominus Iesus''] Vatican.va 16 June 2000 Retrieved 8 October 2011 [http://www.webcitation.org/62HdQHvQL WebCitation archive]</ref> . 

Ratzinger's 2001 letter ''[[De delictis gravioribus]]''  clarified the confidentiality of internal church investigations, as defined in the 1962 document ''[[Crimen Sollicitationis]]'', into accusations made against priests of certain crimes, including [[sexual abuse]]. This became a target of controversy during the [[Roman Catholic sex abuse cases|sex abuse scandal]]. <ref name="observer-2001-let">{{Cite news| first=Jamie | last=Doward | url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1469055,00.html | title=Pope 'obstructed' sex abuse inquiry |work=[[The Observer]] |location=London | date=24 April 2005 |accessdate=14 July 2007 }} [http://www.webcitation.org/62Hdu4m2k WebCitation archive]</ref> While bishops hold the secrecy pertained only internally, and did not preclude investigation by civil law enforcement, the letter was often seen as promoting a coverup. <ref>{{cite web| title=UK Bishops Angered by BBC Attack on Pope | date=2 October 2006 | accessdate=14 April 2008 | url= http://www.ewtn.com/vnews/getstory.asp?number=71831 | publisher=[[Catholic News Agency]] | work=[[Eternal Word Television Network|EWTN]]}} [http://www.webcitation.org/62HeLbEGS WebCitation archive]</ref> Later, as Pope, he was accused in a lawsuit of conspiring to cover up the molestation of three boys in Texas, but sought and obtained [[diplomatic immunity]] from prosecution. <ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/pope-seeks-immunity-over-sex-abuse-suit/2005/08/17/1123958097061.html "Pope seeks immunity in Texas abuse case"], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' 17 August 2005 Retrieved 8 October 2011 [http://www.webcitation.org/62HfAzbds WebCitation archive]</ref> . 

On 12 March 1983, Ratzinger, as prefect, notified the lay faithful and the clergy that [[archbishop]] [[Pierre Martin Ngo Dinh Thuc]] had incurred [[excommunication]] ''[[latae sententiae]]'' for [[valid but illicit|illicit]] [[ordination|episcopal consecrations]] without the apostolic mandate.  . 

In 1997, when he turned 70, Ratzinger asked Pope John Paul II for permission to leave the Congregation of the  Doctrine of Faith and to become an archivist in the [[Vatican Secret Archives]] and a librarian in the [[Vatican Library]], but the pope refused such permission. <ref>Caldwell, Simon [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/the-pope/7928493/Pope-Benedict-wanted-to-be-a-librarian.html "Pope Benedict wanted to be a librarian"] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 5 August 2010 Retrieved 21 August 2011 [http://www.webcitation.org/62HffqQvL WebCitation archive]</ref><ref>[http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=7114 Cardinal Ratzinger asked to resign in 1997, become Vatican librarian], CatholicCulture.org, 5 August 2010 Retrieved 8 October 2011 [http://www.webcitation.org/62Hfxuiko WebCitation archive]</ref> .

{{Main|Papal conclave, 2005}} . 

====Prediction====. 
On 2 January 2005, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine quoted unnamed Vatican sources as saying that Ratzinger was a front runner to succeed John Paul II should the pope die or become too ill to continue as pope. On the death of John Paul II, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' gave the odds of Ratzinger becoming pope as 7–1, the lead position, but close to his rivals on the liberal wing of the church. In April 2005, before his election as pope, he was identified as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by ''Time''. While Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Ratzinger repeatedly stated he would like to retire to his house in the Bavarian village of Pentling near [[Regensburg]] and dedicate himself to writing books.  . 

Though Ratzinger was increasingly considered the front runner by much of the international media, others maintained that his election was far from certain, since very few papal predictions in modern history had come true. The elections of both John Paul II and his predecessor, [[John Paul I]] had been rather unexpected. Despite being the favorite (or perhaps because he was the favorite), it was a surprise to many that he was actually elected, as traditionally the frontrunners are passed over by the conclave for someone else.  . 

====Election====. 
On 19 April 2005, Ratzinger was elected as the successor to Pope John Paul II on the second day of the [[papal conclave, 2005|papal conclave]] after four ballots. Ratzinger had hoped to retire peacefully and said that "At a certain point, I prayed to God 'please don't do this to me'...Evidently, this time He didn't listen to me."<ref>Pizzey, Allen [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/04/02/world/main684865.shtml "Benedict: I Prayed Not To Be Pope"] [[CBS News]] 11 February 2009 Retrieved 21 August 2011 [http://www.webcitation.org/62HgNOHkg WebCitation archive]</ref> Coincidentally, 19 April is the feast of St. [[Pope Leo IX|Leo IX]], the most important German pope of the [[Middle Ages]], known for instituting major reforms during his pontificate.  . 

Before his first appearance at the balcony of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] after becoming pope, he was announced by [[Jorge Medina Estévez]], [[Cardinal Protodeacon]] of the [[Holy Roman Church]]. Cardinal Medina Estévez first addressed the massive crowd as "dear(est) brothers and sisters" in Italian, Spanish, French, German and English, with each language receiving cheers from the international crowd, before continuing with the traditional ''[[Habemus Papam]]'' announcement in Latin.  . 

At the balcony, Benedict's first words to the crowd, given in Italian before he gave the traditional ''[[Urbi et Orbi]]'' blessing in Latin, were:
{{cquote|Dear brothers and sisters, after the great Pope John Paul II, the Cardinals have elected me, a simple, humble labourer in the vineyard of the Lord. The fact that the Lord knows how to work and to act even with insufficient instruments comforts me, and above all I entrust myself to your prayers. In the joy of the Risen Lord, confident of his unfailing help, let us move forward. The Lord will help us, and Mary, His Most Holy Mother, will be on our side. Thank you. <ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/elezione/index_en.htm Apostolic Blessing "Urbi et Orbi"] Vatican.va 19 April 2005 Retrieved 8 October 2011 [http://www.webcitation.org/62HghGMav  WebCitation archive]</ref>}} . 

On 24 April, he celebrated the [[Papal Inauguration|Papal Inauguration Mass]] in [[St. Peter's Square]], during which he was invested with the [[Pallium]] and the [[Ring of the Fisherman]]. Then, on 7 May, he took possession of his cathedral church, the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran|Archbasilica of St. John Lateran]].  . 

===Choice of name===. 
Ratzinger chose the [[papal name|pontifical name]] [[Benedict]], which comes from the Latin word meaning "the blessed", in honour of both [[Pope Benedict XV]] and Saint [[Benedict of Nursia]]. Pope Benedict XV was Pope during the First World War, during which time he passionately pursued peace between the warring nations. St. Benedict of Nursia was the founder of the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monasteries (most monasteries of the Middle Ages were of the Benedictine order) and the author of the ''[[Rule of Saint Benedict]]'', which is still the most influential writing regarding the monastic life of Western Christianity.  . 

The pope explained his choice of name during his first [[General Audience]] in St. Peter's Square, on 27 April 2005:
{{cquote|Filled with sentiments of awe and thanksgiving, I wish to speak of why I chose the name Benedict. Firstly, I remember Pope Benedict XV, that courageous prophet of peace, who guided the Church through turbulent times of war. In his footsteps I place my ministry in the service of reconciliation and harmony between peoples. Additionally, I recall [[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict of Nursia]], co-[[patron saint|patron]] of Europe, whose life evokes the Christian roots of Europe. I ask him to help us all to hold firm to the centrality of Christ in our Christian life: May Christ always take first place in our thoughts and actions!<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/audiences/2005/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20050427_en.html "Reflection on the name chosen: Benedict XVI"] Vatican.va 27 April 2005 Retrieved 5 October 2011 [http://www.webcitation.org/62Doblc8d WebCitation archive]</ref>}} . 

===Tone of papacy===. 
[[File:Benedikt XVI im Papamobil.jpg|thumb|Pope Benedict XVI's first trip in the [[Popemobile]]]]
During his inaugural Mass, the previous custom of every cardinal submitting to the Pope was replaced by having twelve people, including cardinals, clergy, religious, a married couple and their child, and newly [[confirmation|confirmed]] people, greet him. (The cardinals had formally sworn their obedience upon his election.) He began using an open-topped [[Popemobile|papal car]], saying that he wanted to be closer to the people. Pope Benedict has continued the tradition of his predecessor John Paul II and baptises several infants in the Sistine Chapel at the beginning of each year, in his pastoral role as Bishop of Rome.  . 

====Beatifications====. 
On 9 May 2005, Benedict XVI began the [[beatification]] process for his predecessor, Pope John Paul II. Normally, five years must pass after a person's death before the beatification process can begin. However, in an audience with Pope Benedict, [[Camillo Ruini]], [[Vicar General]] of the Diocese of Rome and the official responsible for promoting the [[canonization|cause for canonization]] of any person who dies within that diocese, cited "exceptional circumstances" which suggested that the waiting period could be waived. This happened before, when [[Pope Paul VI]] waived the five year rule and announced beatification processes for his predecessors, [[Pope Pius XII]] and [[Pope John XXIII]]. Benedict XVI followed this precedent when he waived the five year rule for John Paul II. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/csaints/documents/rc_con_csaints_doc_20050509_rescritto-gpii_en.html |title=Response of  His Holiness Benedict XVI for the examination of the cause for beatification and canonization of the Servant of God John Paul II |publisher=Vatican.va |date=9 May 2005 |accessdate=2 February 2010}} [http://www.webcitation.org/62HhLqGGU WebCitation archive]</ref> The decision was announced on 13 May 2005, the Feast of [[Our Lady of Fátima]] and the 24th anniversary of the attempt on John Paul II's life. <ref>{{cite web|author=Drummer, Alexander |url=http://www.zenit.org/article-13001?l=english|title=Waiting Period Waived for John Paul II|publisher=[[Zenit News Agency]]|date=13 May 2005 |accessdate=24 September 2011}} [http://www.webcitation.org/62HhqWEPm WebCitation archive]</ref> John Paul II often credited Our Lady of Fátima for preserving him on that day.

The first beatification under the new Pope was celebrated on 14 May 2005, by [[José Cardinal Saraiva Martins]], Cardinal Prefect of the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]]. The new Blesseds were [[Mother Marianne Cope]] and [[Mother Ascensión Nicol Goñi]]. [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Clemens August Graf von Galen]] was beatified on 9 October 2005. [[Mariano de la Mata]] was beatified in November 2006 and [[Rosa Eluvathingal]] was beatified 3 December of that year, and Fr. [[Basil Moreau]] was beatified September 2007. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holycrossusa.org/spirituality/our-founder-blessed-basil-moreau-csc/ |title=Our Founder|publisher=[[Congregation of Holy Cross]]|date=24 August 2011|accessdate=8 October 2011}}[http://www.webcitation.org/62HiUpZeg WebCitation archive]</ref> In October 2008 the following beatifications took place: Celestine of the Mother of God, Giuseppina Nicoli, Hendrina Stenmanns, Maria Rosa Flesch, Marta Anna Wiecka, [[Michael Sopocko]], [[Petrus Kibe Kasui and 187 Companions]], [[Blessed Candlemas of San José|Susana Paz-Castillo Ramirez]], Maria Isbael Salvat Romero, and [[John Henry Newman]].  . 

Unlike his predecessor, Benedict XVI delegated the beatification liturgical service to a Cardinal. On 29 September 2005, the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] issued a communiqué announcing that henceforth beatifications would be celebrated by a representative of the Pope, usually the Prefect of that Congregation. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/csaints/documents/rc_con_csaints_doc_20050929_comunicato_en.html |title=Communiqué on beatification process |publisher=Vatican.va |date=29 September 2005 |accessdate=2 February 2010}} [http://www.webcitation.org/62Hj1Y6F4 WebCitation archive]</ref> . 

====Canonizations====. 
[[File:BentoXVI-43-11052007.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Pope Benedict at the canonization of [[Frei Galvão]]]]
Pope Benedict XVI celebrated his first canonizations on 23 October 2005 in [[St. Peter's Square]] when he canonized [[Josef Bilczewski]], [[Saint Alberto Hurtado|Alberto Hurtado SJ]], [[Zygmunt Gorazdowski]], [[Gaetano Catanoso]], and [[Felice da Nicosia]].

===Curia reform===. 
{{Politics of the Holy See}}
Pope Benedict began downsizing the [[Roman Curia]] when he merged four existing pontifical councils into two in March 2006. The [[Pontifical Council for Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant Peoples|Pontifical Council for Migrants]] was merged with the [[Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace]] headed by [[Renato Martino|Cardinal Martino]]. Likewise, [[Paul Poupard|Cardinal Poupard]], who headed the [[Pontifical Council for Culture]], now also oversees the operations of what had been the [[Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue]], though both Councils maintained separate officials and staffs while their status and competencies continued unchanged. In May 2007 it was decided that Interreligious Dialogue would again become a separate body under a different President. In June 2010 Benedict created the [[Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation]]. He appointed [[Rino Fisichella|Archbishop Salvatore Fisichella]] as its first president.  . 

===Teachings===. 
{{See also|Theology of Pope Benedict XVI}}
As Pope, one of Benedict XVI's main roles is to teach about the Catholic faith and the solutions to the problems of discerning and living the faith,<ref>Beach, Kevin [http://www.catholicmissionleaflets.org/leafpope.htm "What is the role of the Pope?] Catholic Mission Leaflets [http://www.webcitation.org/62IN0XB3T WebCitation archive]</ref> a role that he can play well as a former head of the Church's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. The main points of emphasis of his teachings are stated in more detail in Theology of Pope Benedict XVI.  . 

===="Friendship with Jesus Christ"====. 
At the conclusion of his first homily as Pope, Benedict referred to both [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] and John Paul II. Citing John Paul II's well-known words, "Do not be afraid! Open wide the doors for Christ!", Benedict XVI said: . 

{{cquote|Are we not perhaps all afraid in some way? If we let Christ enter fully into our lives, if we open ourselves totally to Him, are we not afraid that He might take something away from us?...And once again the Pope said: No! If we let Christ into our lives, we lose nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing of what makes life free, beautiful and great. No! Only in this friendship do we experience beauty and liberation....When we give ourselves to Him, we receive a hundredfold in return. Yes, open, open wide the doors to Christ&nbsp;– and you will find true life. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20050424_inizio-pontificato_en.html |title=Mass for the Inauguration of the Pontificate of Pope Benedict XVI - Homily of His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI|publisher=Vatican.va |date=24 April 2005|accessdate=2 February 2010}} [http://www.webcitation.org/62INVqmrK WebCitation archive]</ref>}} .

He took up this theme in his first encyclical ''[[Deus Caritas Est]]''. In his personal explanation and summary of the encyclical, he stated: "If friendship with God becomes for us something ever more important and decisive, then we will begin to love those whom God loves and who are in need of us. God wants us to be friends of his friends and we can be so, if we are interiorly close to them."<ref>{{cite web|author=Drummer, Alexander |url=http://www.zenit.org/article-15211?l=english|title=The Secret of Love, According to Benedict XVI - Pope Explains Encyclical to Readers of Italian Magazine|publisher=Zenit News Agency|date=7 February 2006 |accessdate=8 October 2011}} [http://www.webcitation.org/62IQhgKSc WebCitation archive]</ref> Thus, he said that prayer is "urgently needed...It is time to reaffirm the importance of prayer in the face of the activism and the growing secularism of many Christians engaged in charitable work." . 

===="Dictatorship of Relativism"====. 
Continuing what he said in the pre-conclave Mass about what he has often referred to as the "central problem of our faith today",<ref>Ratzinger, Joseph [http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/RATZRELA.HTM "Relativism: The Central Problem for Faith Today"] [[Eternal Word Television Network|EWTN]] May 1996 Retrieved 8 October 2011 [http://www.webcitation.org/62HjsipEm WebCitation archive]</ref> on 6 June 2005 Pope Benedict also said:
{{cquote|Today, a particularly insidious obstacle to the task of education is the massive presence in our society and culture of that [[relativism]] which, recognising nothing as definitive, leaves as the ultimate criterion only the self with its desires. And under the semblance of freedom it becomes a prison for each one, for it separates people from one another, locking each person into his or her own ego. <ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2005/june/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20050606_convegno-famiglia_en.html "Address of His Holiness Benedict XVI to the participants in the Ecclesial Diocesan Convention of Rome"] 6 June 2005

He said that "a dictatorship of relativism"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/word/wyd082105.htm |title=Coverage of World Youth Day exclusively by NCR Report #4: Do-it-yourself religion 'cannot ultimately help us,' pope tells youth|last=Allen, Jr. |first=John L. |publisher=[[National Catholic Reporter]]|date=21 August 2005 |accessdate=2 February 2010}} [http://www.webcitation.org/62Do1g5ka WebCitation archive]</ref> was the core challenge facing the church and humanity. At the root of this problem, he said, is [[Kant]]'s "self-limitation of reason". This, he said, is contradictory to the modern acclamation of science whose excellence is based on the power of reason to know the truth. He said that this self-amputation of reason leads to pathologies of religion such as terrorism and pathologies of science such as [[List of environmental disasters|ecological disasters]]. <ref name=TT>{{cite book |title=Truth And Tolerance: Christian Belief And World Religions |last=Ratzinger |first=Joseph |year=2003 |publisher=[[Ignatius Press]]|isbn=1-58617-035-X |pages= |url= }}</ref> Benedict traced the failed revolutions and violent ideologies of the 20th century to a conversion of partial points of view into absolute guides.

In an address to a conference of the Diocese of Rome held at the basilica of [[St. John Lateran]] 6 June 2005, Benedict remarked on the issues of [[same sex marriage]] and [[abortion]]:
:The various forms of the dissolution of matrimony today, like free unions, trial marriages and going up to pseudo-matrimonies by people of the same sex, are rather expressions of an anarchic freedom that wrongly passes for true freedom of man...from here it becomes all the more clear how contrary it is to human love, to the profound vocation of man and woman, to systematically close their union to the gift of life, and even worse to suppress or tamper with the life that is born. <ref>[http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2005/6/6/144634.shtml "Pope Benedict XVI Condemns Same-Sex Unions"], [[Newsmax Media|NewsMax.com]], 6 June 2005 Retrieved 18 September 2011 [http://www.webcitation.org/62Dla7iz0 WebCitation archive]</ref> . 

====Christianity as religion according to reason====. 
In the discussion with [[secularism]] and [[rationalism]], one of Benedict's basic ideas can be found in his address on the "Crisis of Culture" in the West, a day before Pope John Paul II died, when he referred to Christianity as the Religion of the Logos (the Greek for "word", "reason", "meaning", or "intelligence"). He said:
{{cquote|From the beginning, Christianity has understood itself as the religion of the ''Logos'', as the religion according to reason...It has always defined men, all men without distinction, as creatures and images of God, proclaiming for them...the same dignity. In this connection, the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] is of Christian origin and it is no accident that it was born precisely and exclusively in the realm of the Christian faith....It was and is the merit of the Enlightenment to have again proposed these original values of Christianity and of having given back to reason its own voice... Today, this should be precisely [Christianity's] philosophical strength, in so far as the problem is whether the world comes from the irrational, and reason is not other than a 'sub-product,' on occasion even harmful of its development—or whether the world comes from reason, and is, as a consequence, its criterion and goal...In the so necessary dialogue between secularists and Catholics, we Christians must be very careful to remain faithful to this fundamental line: to live a faith that comes from the ''Logos'', from creative reason, and that, because of this, is also open to all that is truly rational. <ref>{{cite web|author=Drummer, Alexander |url=http://www.zenit.org/article-13705?l=english|title=Cardinal Ratzinger on Europe's Crisis of Culture (Part 4)|publisher=[[Zenit News Agency]]|date=29 July 2005 |accessdate=24 September 2011}}[http://www.webcitation.org/62Dl6ltQP WebCitation archive]</ref>}} . 

Benedict also emphasised that "Only creative reason, which in the crucified God is manifested as love, can really show us the way." .

Pope Benedict has to date written three [[encyclical]]s: ''[[Deus Caritas Est]]'' ([[Latin]] for "God is Love"), ''[[Spe Salvi]]'' ("Saved by Hope"), and ''[[Caritas in Veritate]]'' ("Love in Truth").  . 

In his first encyclical, ''Deus Caritas Est'', he said that a human being, created in the image of God who is love, is able to practice love: to give himself to God and others ([[agape]]), by receiving and experiencing God's love in contemplation. This life of love, according to him, is the life of the saints such as [[Mother Teresa|Teresa of Calcutta]] and the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Blessed Virgin Mary]], and is the direction Christians take when they believe that God loves them in Jesus Christ. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20051225_deus-caritas-est_en.html |title=''Deus Caritas Est'' |publisher=Vatican.va |date=25 December 2005|accessdate=2 February 2010}} [http://www.webcitation.org/62DkoEEdY WebCitation archive]</ref> . 

The encyclical contains almost 16,000 words in 42 paragraphs. The first half is said to have been written by Benedict in German, his [[first language|mother tongue]], in the summer of 2005; the second half is derived from uncompleted writings left by his predecessor, [[Pope John Paul II]]. <ref>Fisher, Ian [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/26/international/europe/26pope.html?pagewanted=all "Benedict's First Encyclical Shuns Strictures of Orthodoxy"] ''The New York Times'' 26 January 2006 Retrieved 5 October 2011 [http://www.webcitation.org/62DkFLoM4 WebCitation archive]</ref>  The document was signed by Pope Benedict on Christmas Day, 25 December 2005. <ref>Thavis, John

Benedict's third encyclical titled ''[[Caritas in Veritate]]'' ("Love in Truth" or "Charity in Truth"), was signed on 29 June 2009 (the Feast of Sts.

It was made available in various languages 13 March 2007 in Rome. The English edition from ''Libera Editrice Vaticana'' is 158 pages.

====Motu proprio on Tridentine Mass====. 
{{See also|Summorum Pontificum}}

On 7 July 2007, Benedict XVI issued the ''[[motu proprio]] [[Summorum Pontificum]]'', declaring that upon "the request of the faithful", celebration of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] according to the [[Tridentine Mass|Missal of 1962]] (commonly known as the [[Tridentine Mass]]), was to be more easily permitted. Stable groups who previously had to petition their bishop to have a Tridentine Mass may now merely request permission from their local priest. <ref name="Afica Latin">{{Cite news|title=Pope Allows Worldwide Use of Old Latin Mass|publisher=Catholic Information Service for Africa|date=10 July 2007|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200707101009.html}}</ref> While ''Summorum Pontificum'' directs that pastors should provide the [[Tridentine Mass]] upon the requests of the faithful, it also allows for any qualified priest to offer private celebrations of the Tridentine Mass, to which the faithful may be admitted if they wish. <ref name="letter Motu">{{cite web|title=Letter of His Holiness Benedict XVI to the Bishops on the Occasion of the Publication of the Apostolic Letter ''Motu Proprio Data'' Summorum Pontificum, On the Use of the Roman Liturgy Prior To The Reform of 1970|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070707_lettera-vescovi_en.html|author=Pope Benedict XVI}} [http://www.webcitation.org/62CDkLx7N WebCitation archive]</ref> For regularly scheduled public celebrations of the Tridentine Mass, the permission of the priest in charge of the church is required. <ref>Article 5 §4 of the motu proprio</ref> . 

In an accompanying letter, the Pope outlined his position concerning questions about the new guidelines. <ref name="letter Motu"/> As there were fears that the move would entail a reversal of the [[Second Vatican Council]],<ref name="Jason">{{Cite news|title=Criticism over return of Latin Mass|author=Burke, Jason |url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/07/09/stories/2007070955601600.htm|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=9 July 2007 |accessdate=4 October 2011}} [http://www.webcitation.org/62CCyEr9l WebCitation archive]</ref> Benedict emphasised that the Tridentine Mass would not detract from the Council, and that the [[Mass of Paul VI]] would still be the norm and priests were not permitted to refuse to say the Mass in that form. He pointed out that use of Tridentine Mass "was never juridically abrogated and, consequently, in principle, was always permitted."<ref name="letter Motu"/> The letter also decried "deformations of the liturgy ... because in many places celebrations were not faithful to the prescriptions of the new Missal" as the Second Vatican Council was wrongly seen "as authorising or even requiring creativity", mentioning his own experience. <ref name="letter Motu"/> . 

The Pope considered that allowing the Tridentine Mass to those who request it was a means to prevent or heal [[schism (religion)|schism]], stating that, on occasions in past history, "not enough was done by the Church’s leaders to maintain or regain reconciliation and unity" and that this "imposes an obligation on us today: to make every effort to enable for all those who truly desire unity to remain in that unity or to attain it anew."<ref name="letter Motu"/> Many feel the decree aimed at ending the schism between the Holy See and traditionalist groups such as the [[Society of St. Pius X]] (SSPX). Cardinal [[Darío Castrillón Hoyos]], the president of the [[Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei|Pontifical Commission established for the purpose of facilitating full ecclesial communion of those associated with that Society]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/ced_documents/rc_con_cfaith_20090930_ecclesia-dei_en.html |title=Pontifical Commission "Ecclesia Dei" |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=14 June 2010}} [http://www.webcitation.org/62CCY1n2C WebCitation archive]</ref> stated that the decree "opened the door for their return". Bishop Bernard Fellay, superior general of the SSPX, expressed "deep gratitude to the Sovereign Pontiff for this great spiritual benefit". <ref name="Afica Latin"/> . 

====Unicity and Salvific Universality of the Church====. 
Near the end of June 2007, the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] issued a document approved by Benedict XVI "because some contemporary theological interpretations of [[Vatican II]]'s ecumenical intent had been 'erroneous or ambiguous' and had prompted confusion and doubt."<ref name="Winfield">{{cite news |title=Pope: Other Christians not true churches |author= |first=Nicole |last= Winfield |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-07-10-1587290358_x.htm |agency=Associated Press  |newspaper=USAToday |date=10 July 2007  |accessdate=18 September 2011}}[http://www.webcitation.org/62CCFXvHG WebCitation archive]</ref> The document has been seen as restating "key sections of a 2000 text the pope wrote when he was prefect of the congregation, ''Dominus Iesus''."<ref name="Winfield"/> . 

====Consumerism====. 
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
Benedict XVI has condemned excessive [[consumerism]], especially among youth. He stated in December 2007 that "[A]dolescents, youths and even children are easy victims of the corruption of love, deceived by unscrupulous adults who, lying to themselves and to them, draw them into the dead-end streets of consumerism."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/children_in_consumerist_societies_risk_losing_hope_says_pope_benedict/|title=Children in consumerist societies "risk losing hope," says Pope Benedict

In June 2009, he blamed outsourcing for greater availability of consumer goods which lead to downsizing of social security systems. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20090629_caritas-in-veritate_en.html |title=''Caritas in Veritate'' Encyclical Letter of 29 June 2009 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=2 February 2010}} [http://www.webcitation.org/62CABwZJA WebCitation archive]</ref> . 

===Ecumenical efforts===. 
{{Main|Pope Benedict XVI and Ecumenism}}
Speaking at his weekly audience in St Peter's Square on 7 June 2006, Pope Benedict asserted that Jesus himself had entrusted the leadership of the Church to his apostle [[Saint Peter|Peter]]. "Peter's responsibility thus consists of guaranteeing the communion with Christ," said Pope Benedict. "Let us pray so that the [[primacy of Simon Peter|primacy of Peter]], entrusted to poor human beings, may always be exercised in this original sense desired by the Lord, so that it will be increasingly recognised in its true meaning by brothers who are still not in communion with us." . 

===Dialogue with other religions===. 
Pope Benedict is open to dialogue with other religious groups, and has sought to improve relations with them throughout his pontificate. <ref name="Signs_of_Hope" /><ref>Allen, John L. [http://www.forward.com/articles/123888/ "Making Sense of Benedict's Jewish Policy"] ''[[The Forward]]'' 20 January 2010 Retrieved 27 December 2010 [http://www.webcitation.org/6298xPopX WebCitation archive]</ref> He has, however, generated certain controversies in doing so.  . 

====Judaism====. 
{{Main|Pope Benedict XVI and Judaism}}
When Benedict ascended to the Papacy his election was welcomed by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] who noted "his great sensitivity to Jewish history and the [[Holocaust]]". <ref>[http://www.adl.org/PresRele/VaticanJewish_96/44698_96.htm "ADL Welcomes Election of Cardinal Ratzinger as New Pope"]. The [[Anti-Defamation League]] 19 April 2005 Retrieved 30 December 2008. [http://www.webcitation.org/6299Ou2T7 WebCitation archive]</ref>  However, his election received a more reserved response from the United Kingdom's Chief Rabbi [[Jonathan Sacks]], who hoped that Benedict would "continue along the path of Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II in working to enhance relations with the Jewish people and the State of Israel."<ref name="BBC4462503">{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4462503.stm | title=In quotes: Reaction to Pope election | date=20 April 2005 |publisher=BBC News  | accessdate=31 January 2009}} [http://www.webcitation.org/6299zbnQI WebCitation archive]</ref>  The Foreign Minister of Israel also offered more tentative praise, though the Minister believed that "this Pope, considering his historical experience, will be especially committed to an uncompromising fight against anti-Semitism."<ref name="BBC4462503"/> . 

Critics have accused Benedict's papacy of insensitivity towards Judaism. The two most prominent instances were the expansion of the use of the [[Tridentine Mass]] and the lifting of the excommunication on four bishops from the [[Society of St. Pius X]] (SSPX). In the Good Friday service, the traditional Mass rubrics include a prayer that asks God to lift the veil so ''they [Jews] may be delivered from their darkness''. This prayer has historically been contentious in Judaic-Catholic relations and several groups saw the [[Good Friday Prayer for the Jews#Debate after the Summorum Pontificum motu proprio|restoration of the Tridentine Mass as problematic.]]<ref name="tomorrow">[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=9812 "Vatican to release Benedict XVI's letter on the use of the Tridentine Mass tomorrow"] Catholic News Agency 6 July 2007 Retrieved 2 October 2011 [http://www.webcitation.org/629AR2nvk WebCitation archive]</ref><ref>[http://sandiegojewishworld.com/2007-sdjw/2007-07%20sdjw/2007-07-06friday/2007-07-06.htm "Mikulanis says ADL jumped gun, got its facts wrong"] ''San Diego Jewish World''.

====Islam====. 
{{Main|Pope Benedict XVI and Islam}}
Pope Benedict's relations with [[Islam]] have been strained at times. On 12 September 2006 Pope Benedict XVI delivered a lecture which touched on Islam at the [[University of Regensburg]] in Germany. The pope had previously served as professor of [[theology]] at the university, and his lecture was entitled "Faith, Reason and the University—Memories and Reflections". 
The lecture received much attention from political and religious authorities. Many [[Islamic world|Islamic politicians and religious leaders]] registered their protest against what they said was an insulting mischaracterisation of Islam, although his focus was aimed towards the rationality of religious violence, and its effect on the religion. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5348436.stm "In quotes: Muslim reaction to Pope"], BBC News, 16 September 2006.

As Pontiff, Benedict XVI carries out numerous Apostolic activities including journeys across the world and in the Vatican.  . 

Benedict travelled extensively during the first three years of his papacy. In addition to his travels within Italy, Pope Benedict XVI has made two visits to his homeland, Germany, one for [[World Youth Day]] and another to visit the towns of his childhood. He has also visited Poland and Spain, where he was enthusiastically received. <ref>Israely, Jeff [http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1211537,00.html "The Pope Squares Off With Spain's Secular Champion"] "No doubt Benedict was buoyed by the enthusiastic welcome he received in Valencia."

In 2007, Pope Benedict visited Brazil in order to address the Bishops' Conference there and canonize [[Frei Galvão|Friar Antônio Galvão]], an 18th century [[Franciscan]]. In June 2007, Benedict made a personal pilgrimage and pastoral visit to [[Assisi]], the birthplace of [[St. Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]]. In September, Benedict undertook a three day visit to Austria,<ref>Vatican Radio [http://storico.radiovaticana.org/en1/storico/2007-09/153562_pope_benedict_xvi_going_to_vienna.html "Pope Benedict XVI Going to Vienna"] 7 September 2007 Retrieved 26 January 2011 [http://www.webcitation.org/624fltp2u WebCitation archive]</ref> during which he joined Vienna's [[Chief Rabbi]], Paul Chaim Eisenberg, in a memorial to the 65,000 Viennese Jews who perished in Nazi death camps. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6982878.stm Pope honours Austrian Jewish dead], BBC News, 7 September 2007.

In 2009, he visited Africa ([[Cameroon]] and [[Angola]]) for the first time as a Pope. During his visit, he suggested that altering sexual behavior was the answer to Africa's AIDS crisis, and urged Catholics to reach out and convert believers in [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]].  . 

He visited the Middle East (Jordan, Israel and Palestine) in May 2009.  . 

Pope Benedict's main arena for pastoral activity is the Vatican itself, his Christmas and Easter homilies and [[Urbi et Orbi]] are delivered from St Peter's Basilica. The Vatican is also the only regular place where the Pope travels via motor without the protective bulletproof case common to most popemobiles. Despite the more secure setting Pope Benedict has been victim to security risks several times inside Vatican City. On Wednesday, 6 June 2007 during his General Audience a man lept across a barrier, evaded guards and nearly mounted the Pope's vehicle, although he was stopped and Benedict seemed to be unaware of the event. On Thursday, 24 December 2009, while Pope Benedict was proceeding to the altar to celebrate Christmas Eve [[Mass]] at [[St Peter's Basilica]], a woman later identified as 25-year-old [[Susanna Maiolo]], who holds Italian and Swiss citizenships, jumped the barrier and grabbed the pope by his [[Papal vestments|vestments]] and pulled him to the ground. The 82-year-old fell but was assisted to his feet and he continued to proceed towards the altar to celebrate Mass. [[Roger Etchegaray]], 87, the vice-dean of the [[College of Cardinals]], fell also and suffered a hip fracture.

Between 17 and 18 April, Pope Benedict made an Apostolic Journey to the Republic of [[Malta]]. Following meetings with various dignitaries on his first day on the island, 50,000 people gathered in a [[drizzle]] for Papal Mass on the granaries in [[Floriana]]. The Pope also met with the [[Maltese people|Maltese]] youth at the [[Valletta]] Waterfront, where an estimated 10,000 young people turned up to greet him. <ref>{{cite web|title=Wrap-up: Pope Benedict's historic Malta visit ends|work=[[The Times (Malta)|The Times of Malta]]|date=18 April 2010|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20100418/papal-visit/pope-benedicts-historic-malta-visit-ends|accessdate=21 April 2010}} [http://www.webcitation.org/62688oVsW WebCitation archive]</ref> During his visit the Pope was moved to tears while expressing his shame at cases of abuse on the island during a 20 minute meeting with victims. <ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/> . 

===Sexual abuse in the Catholic Church===. 
{{See also|Catholic sex abuse cases}} . 

Prior to 2001, the primary responsibility for investigating allegations of sexual abuse and disciplining perpetrators rested with the individual dioceses. In 2001, Ratzinger convinced John Paul II to put the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] in charge of all investigations and policies surrounding sexual abuse in order to combat such abuse more efficiently. <ref name="times-7086738">{{Cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article7086738.ece | work=[[The Times]] | location=London | title=John Paul ‘ignored abuse of 2,000 boys’| first1=Bojan | last1=Pancevski | first2=John | last2=Follain | date=4 April 2010 | accessdate=22 May 2010}} [http://www.webcitation.org/6269S63LN WebCitation archive]</ref><ref name="ncr-maciel">{{cite web|last=Berry |first=Jason |url=http://ncronline.org/news/accountability/money-paved-way-maciels-influence-vatican |title=Money paved way for Maciel's influence in the Vatican

One of the cases Ratzinger pursued involved Father [[Marcial Maciel Degollado]], a Mexican priest and founder of the [[Legion of Christ]], who had been accused repeatedly of sexual abuse. Biographer Andrea Tornielli suggested that Cardinal Ratzinger had wanted to take action against Marcial Maciel Degollado, but that John Paul II and other high-ranking officials, including several cardinals and notably the pope's influential secretary [[Stanisław Dziwisz]], prevented him from doing so. <ref name="ncr-maciel" /><ref name="indenpendent-johnpaul">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/vatican-tries-to-shift-blame-for-abuse-on-to-john-paul-2123826.html |title=Vatican tries to shift blame for abuse on to John Paul

{{Main|Ceremonial of Benedict XVI}}
Pope Benedict XVI has re-introduced several [[papal garments]] which had previously fallen into disuse. Pope Benedict XVI resumed the use of the traditional red [[papal shoes]], which had not been used since early in the pontificate of Pope John Paul II. Contrary to the initial speculation of the press that the shoes had been made by the Italian fashion house [[Prada]], the [[Holy See|Vatican]] announced that the shoes were provided by the pope's personal shoemaker. <ref name="WSJ">Meichtry, Stacy [http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB114591920439834611-OtBN7F_qbGxt2YstGeEXX1WoMzQ_20060524.html?mod=tff_main_tff_top "Does the Pope Wear Prada?"] ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. 25 April 2006 Retrieved 19 January 2007.

On 21 December 2005, the pope began wearing the [[camauro]], the traditional red papal hat usually worn in the winter. It had not been seen since the pontificate of Pope John XXIII (1958–1963). On 6 September 2006 the pope began wearing the red [[cappello romano]] (also called a saturno), a wide-brimmed hat for outdoor use. Rarely used by John Paul II, it was more widely worn by his predecessors.  . 

===Health===. 
Prior to his election as Pope in 2005, Joseph Ratzinger had hoped to retire—on account of of age-related health problems, a long-held desire to have free time to write, and the retirement age for bishops (75)—and submitted his resignation as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith three times, but continued at his post in obedience to the wishes of Pope John Paul II. In September 1991, Ratzinger suffered a hemorrhagic stroke, which slightly impaired his eyesight temporarily but he recovered completely. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/neuer-papst_aid_93745.html |title=Vor Jahren Ratzinger erlitt Hirnblutung|language={{de icon}} |publisher=Focus Online |accessdate=14 June 2010}} [http://www.webcitation.org/624cM8LmI WebCitation archive]</ref> This was never affirmed – the official news was that Cardinal Ratzinger fell and struck his head against a radiator – but an open secret known to the Conclave that elected him Pope. <ref name="op-online.de">{{cite web|url=http://www.op-online.de/nachrichten/welt/gesund-papst-benedikt-xvi-412967.html |title=Wie gesund ist Papst Benedikt XVI.?|language={{de icon}} |publisher=Op-online.de |date=17 July 2009 |accessdate=12 September 2010}} [http://www.webcitation.org/624bp82dT WebCitation archive]</ref> . 

Since his election in April 2005 there have been several rumors about the Pope's health but none of them have ever been confirmed. Early in his pontificate Pope Benedict XVI predicted a short reign which led to concerns about his health. <ref>[http://www.baltimoresun.com/bal-te.health21apr21,0,5684034.story "Pope predicted 'short reign' in remarks just after election"] ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' 21 April 2005 Retrieved 17 September 2011 [http://www.webcitation.org/624bFrIm1 WebCitation archive]</ref> In May 2005, the Vatican revealed that he had subsequently suffered another mild stroke. French Cardinal [[Philippe Barbarin]] further revealed that since the first stroke, Ratzinger had been suffering from a heart condition as a result of his age, for which he is currently on medication. In late November 2006, Vatican insiders told the international press that the Pope had a routine examination of the heart. <ref name="op-online.de"/> A few days later an unconfirmed rumor emerged that Pope Benedict had undergone an operation in preparation for an eventual bypass operation but this rumor was only published by a small left-wing Italian newspaper and was never confirmed by any Vatican insider. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/5510527.asp?gid=74 |title=Vatican: Pope Benedict's gaffes result of high tension |publisher=[[Hürriyet]]|accessdate=2 February 2010}}[http://www.webcitation.org/624ay1PWY WebCitation archive]</ref> .

The official style of the Pope is '''His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI'''; in Latin, '''Benedictus XVI''', '''Episcopus Romae'''. However, his rarely used full title is: ''His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI, [[Bishop of Rome]], [[Vicar of Christ]], [[Successor of the Prince of the Apostles]], [[Pontifex Maximus|Supreme Pontiff]] of the Universal Church, [[Primate (religion)|Primate]] of Italy, [[Archbishop]] and [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of the Roman province, [[Vatican City#Head of state|Sovereign of the State of the Vatican City]], [[Servant of the Servants of God]].'' . 

Before 1 March 2006, the list of titles also used to contain that of a "[[Patriarch of the West]]", which traditionally appeared in that list of titles before "Primate of Italy". The title of "Patriarch of the West" was first adopted in the year 642 by [[Pope Theodore I]], but was rarely used since the [[East-West Schism]] of 1054. From the Orthodox perspective, authority in the Church could be traced to the five patriarchates of Rome, [[Constantinople]], [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]] and [[Jerusalem]]. However, some Catholic theologians have argued that the term "Patriarch of the West" has no clear historical or theological basis and was introduced into the papal court in 1870 at the time of the [[First Vatican Council]]. Pope Benedict chose to remove the title at a time when discussions with the Orthodox churches have centred on the issue of papal primacy.  .

Joseph Ratzinger wrote his dissertation on The People of God and the House of God in Augustine's Teaching is always about the Church, and therefore has a personal connection with the thought of this great Doctor of the Church. <br />''Moor of Freising'': The Moor's head is an heraldic charge associated with Freising, Germany. <br />''Corbinian's bear'': A legend states that while travelling to Rome, Saint Corbinian's pack horse was killed by a bear. He commanded the bear to carry the load. Once he arrived, he released it from his service, and it returned to Bavaria. The implication is that "Christianity tamed and domesticated the ferocity of paganism and thus laid the foundations for a great civilisation in the Duchy of Bavaria." At the same time, Corbinian's bear, as God's beast of burden, symbolises the weight of office that Benedict now carries.

==Positions on moral and political issues==. 
===Birth control and HIV/AIDS===. 
In 2005, the Pope listed several ways to combat the spread of HIV, including chastity, fidelity in marriage and anti-poverty efforts; he also rejected the use of condoms. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4081276.stm Pope rejects condoms for Africa]  BBC News 10 June 2005 [http://www.webcitation.org/623AsT6Uw WebCitation archive]</ref> The alleged Vatican investigation of whether there are any cases when married persons may use condoms to protect against the spread of infections surprised many Catholics in the wake of John Paul II's consistent refusal to consider condom use in response to AIDS. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1979145,00.html|title=Catholic Church to Ease Ban on Condom Use |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=24 April 2006 |accessdate=28 September 2011}} [http://www.webcitation.org/623Bk3uHj WebCitation archive]</ref> However, the Vatican has since stated that no such change in the Church's teaching can occur. <ref name="time.com">{{Cite news|author=Israely, Jeff 30 April 2006 |url=http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/article/0,13005,901060508-1189193,00.html |title=Condom Fight: The Vatican Strikes Back |work=TIME  |date=30 April 2006 |accessdate=2 February 2010}} [http://www.webcitation.org/623AR9JiS WebCitation archive]</ref>  ''TIME'' also reported in its 30 April 2006 edition that the Vatican's position remains what it always has been with Vatican officials "flatly dismiss[ing] reports that the Vatican is about to release a document that will condone any condom use."<ref name="time.com"/> . 

In March 2009, the Pope stated: . 

<blockquote>
<p>I would say that this problem of AIDS cannot be overcome merely with money, necessary though it is. If there is no human dimension, if Africans do not help, the problem cannot be overcome by the distribution of prophylactics: on the contrary, they increase it. The solution must have two elements: firstly, bringing out the human dimension of sexuality, that is to say a spiritual and human renewal that would bring with it a new way of behaving towards others, and secondly, true friendship offered above all to those who are suffering, a willingness to make sacrifices and to practise self-denial, to be alongside the suffering. <ref>{{cite web|title= Interview of the Holy Father Benedict XVI during the flight to Africa|url= http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2009/march/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20090317_africa-interview_en.html|publisher=|date= 17 March 2009|accessdate=7 October 2009}} [http://www.webcitation.org/623A6etYs WebCitation archive]</ref></p>
</blockquote> . 

In November 2010, in a book-length interview, the Pope, using the example of male prostitutes, stated that the use of condoms, with the intention of reducing the risk of HIV infection, may be an indication that the prostitute is intending to reduce the evil connected with his or her immoral activity. <ref name="ReferenceA">Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20101221_luce-del-mondo_en.html "Note on the banalization of sexuality Regarding certain interpretations of 'Light of the World'"] [http://www.webcitation.org/6239lgw3B WebCitation archive]</ref> In the same interview, the Pope also reiterated the traditional teaching of the Church that condoms are not seen as a "real or moral solution" to the [[HIV/AIDS pandemic]]. Further, in December 2010, the [[Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith]] explained that the Pope's statement did not constitute a legitimization of either prostitution or contraception, both of which remain gravely immoral. <ref name="ReferenceA"/> . 

===Homosexuality===. 
During his time as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) Benedict XVI made several efforts to tackle the issue of homosexuality within the Church and the wider world. In 1986 the CDF sent a letter to all Bishops entitled: ''[[On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons]]''. The letter condemned a liberal interpretation of the earlier CDF document ''Declaration on Certain Questions Concerning Sexual Ethics'', which had led to a "benign" attitude "to the homosexual condition itself". ''On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons'' clarified that the Church position on Homosexuality was that "although the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil; and thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder."<ref name="OPCHP">Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith [http://www.vatican.edu/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19861001_homosexual-persons_en.html "Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons"] 1 October 1986 Retrieved 28 September 2011 [http://www.webcitation.org/623993vbD WebCitation archive]</ref> However the document also condemned homophobic attacks and violence stating "It is deplorable that homosexual persons have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in action. Such treatment deserves condemnation from the Church's pastors wherever it occurs."<ref name="OPCHP" /> . 

In 1992 he again approved CDF documents declaring that homosexual "inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder" and extended this principle to civil law. "Sexual orientation", the document opined, was not equivalent to race or ethnicity, and it declared that it was "not unjust discrimination to take sexual orientation into account."<ref name = gland>{{Cite news|first= William |last= Saletan |coauthors= |title= Gland Inquisitor: Pope Benedict's antigay tendencies. |url= http://www.slate.com/id/2131019/|work=Slate|date= 29 November 2005 |accessdate=30 December 2008 }} [http://www.webcitation.org/6238n1v15 WebCitation archive]</ref> . 

On 22 December 2008, the Pope gave an end of year message to the [[Roman Curia]] in which he talked about gender and the important distinction between men and women. The pope said that the church viewed the distinction as central to human nature, and "asks that this order, set down by creation, be respected". He characterised gender roles which deviated from his view of what gender roles should be as "a violation of the natural order". The church, he said, "should protect man from the destruction of himself". He said a sort of ecology of man was needed, adding: "The tropical forests do deserve our protection; but man, as a creature, does not deserve any less." He attacked what he described as gender theories which "lead towards the self-emancipation of man from creation and the creator"."<ref name=gender>{{Cite news|first= Tom|last= Kington |coauthors= Riazat Butt|title= Pope angers campaigners with speech seen as attack on homosexuality |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/dec/24/pope-speech-gender-gay-sexuality|work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date= 24 December 2008|accessdate=30 December 2008 }} [http://www.webcitation.org/6238D5SUq WebCitation archive]</ref><ref>{{Cite news|first= Rachel|last= Donadio|title= The Vatican: In Speech, Pope Calls Homosexual Behavior a Violation |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/23/world/europe/23briefs-INSPEECHPOPE_BRF.html?fta=y|work=The New York Times|date= 22 December 2008|accessdate=28 December 2008 }} [http://www.webcitation.org/6237oW2Eh WebCitation archive]</ref> . 

[[LGBT]] groups such as the Italian [[Arcigay]] and German [[LSVD]] have announced that they found the Pope's comments homophobic. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lsvd.de/611+M5e34e9a2777.0.html |title=LSVD:Warum hetzt der Papst immer wieder gegen Homosexuelle? |publisher=Lsvd.de |date=22 June 2008 |accessdate=2 February 2010}}</ref> Aurelio Mancuso, head of Arcigay, saying "A divine programme for men and women is out of line with nature, where the roles are not so clear."<ref name=gender/> . 

Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, claimed the Pope had not wished specifically to attack homosexuality, and had not mentioned gays or lesbians in his text. Father Lombardi insisted, however, that there had been an overreaction to the Pope's remarks. "He was speaking more generally about gender theories which overlook the fundamental difference in creation between men and women and focus instead on cultural conditioning."  Nevertheless, the remarks were interpreted as a call to save mankind from homosexuals and transsexuals. <ref name=gender/> .

====Migrants and refugees====. 
In a message released 14 November 2006, during a Vatican press conference for the 2007 annual observance of [[Refugee#World Refugee Day|World Day for Migrants and Refugees]], the pope urged the ratification of international conventions and policies that defend all migrants, including refugees, [[exile]]s, [[Emergency evacuation|evacuees]], and [[internally displaced person]]s. "The church encourages the ratification of the international legal instruments that aim to defend the rights of migrants, refugees and their families," the pope said. "Much is already being done for the integration of the families of immigrants, although much still remains to be done."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=22001 |title=Pope Benedict XVI message for 93rd World Day of Migrants and Refugees |publisher=Catholic Online |date=14 November 2006 |accessdate=2 February 2010}} [http://www.webcitation.org/6236rFOB5 WebCitation archive page 1] and [http://www.webcitation.org/623763WF2 WebCitation archive page 2]</ref> .

Pope Benedict has also promoted various UN events, such as [[World Refugee Day]], on which he offered up special prayers for refugees and called for the international community to do more to secure refugees' human rights. He also called on Catholic communities and organizations to offer them concrete help. <ref>Wooden, Cindy {{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0603503.htm |title=Pope offers prayers to refugees for United Nations' World Refugee Day |publisher=Catholicnews.com |accessdate=2 February 2010}} [http://www.webcitation.org/6236TQsuV WebCitation archive]</ref> . 

====China====.

In 2007 Benedict sent a letter at Easter to Catholics in China that could have wide-ranging implications for the church's relationship with China's leadership.

====Korea====. 
On 13 November 2006, Benedict said the dispute over the [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|North Korea nuclear weapons program]] should be resolved through negotiations, in his first public comment on the security issue, a news report said. "The Holy See encourages bilateral or multilateral negotiations, convinced that the solution must be sought through peaceful means and in respect for agreements taken by all sides to obtain the denuclearisation of the [[Korean Peninsula]]." Benedict was talking to the new Japanese ambassador to the Vatican. <ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-154356074.html "Pope urges talks to make Korean Peninsula nuclear free"] YON – Yonhap News Agency of Korea 14 November 14, 2006 Retrieved 26 January 2011 [http://www.webcitation.org/6235cWf1f WebCitation archive]</ref> . 

====Turkey====.

In a 2004 ''[[Le Figaro]]'' interview, Ratzinger said that Turkey, which is demographically Muslim but governmentally [[Secularism in Turkey|secular by virtue of its state constitution]], should seek its future in an association of [[Muslim world|Muslim nations]] rather than the European Union, which Ratzinger has stated has Christian roots. He said Turkey had always been "in permanent contrast to Europe and that linking it to Europe would be a mistake. <ref>[http://www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?recnum=31436 "Ratzinger on Turkey in EU, European secularism"] Catholic Culture.org 11 August 2004 Retrieved 18 September 2011 [http://www.webcitation.org/6235GGy75 WebCitation archive]</ref> . 

Later visiting the country to "reiterate the solidarity between the cultures," it was reported that he made a counter-statement backing [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|Turkey's bid to join the EU]].
