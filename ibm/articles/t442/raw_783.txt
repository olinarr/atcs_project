{{Roman Catholicism}} . 

Sex and gender roles in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] have been the subject of both intrigue and controversy throughout the Church's history. The cultural influence of the Catholic Church has been vast, particularly upon western society. <ref name="Orlandis">Orlandis, preface</ref> Christian concepts, introduced into evangelized societies worldwide by the Church, had a significant impact on established cultural views of sex and gender roles. Human sacrifice, slavery, infanticide and polygamy practiced by cultures such as those of the Roman Empire, Europe, Latin America and parts of Africa<ref name="Bokenkotter56">Bokenkotter, p. 56. </ref><ref name="Noble230"/><ref name="Noble445">Noble, p. 445. </ref><ref name="Stearns65">Stearns, p. 65-66. </ref><ref name="Hastings309">Hastings, p. 309. </ref> came to an end through Church evangelization efforts. Historians note that Catholic missionaries, popes and [[Roman Catholic religious order|religious]] were among the leaders in campaigns against slavery, an institution that has existed in almost every culture<ref name="Chadwick242">Chadwick, Owen p. 242. </ref><ref name="Noll137">Noll, p. 137–140. </ref><ref name="Duffy221">Duffy, p. 221</ref> and often included sexual slavery of women. Christianity affected the status of women in evangelized cultures like the Roman Empire by condemning [[infanticide]] (female infanticide was more common), [[divorce]], [[incest]], [[polygamy]] and [[marital infidelity]] of both men and women. <ref name="Bokenkotter56"/><ref name="Noble230">Noble, p. 230. </ref><ref name="Stark104">Stark, p. 104. </ref> Some critics say the Church and teachings by [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]], the [[Fathers of the Church]] and [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] theologians perpetuated a notion that female inferiority was divinely ordained,<ref name="Bokenkotter465">Bokenkotter, p. 465</ref> even though official Church teaching<ref name="Kreeft61">Kreeft, p. 61. </ref> considers women and men to be equal, different, and complementary.  . 

Sexual practices of these cultures were affected by the Christian concept of male, female equality. The sexual act, according to the Church, is sacred within the context of the marital relationship that reflects a complete and life-long mutual gift of a man and a woman,<ref name="Kreeft245">Kreeft, p. 245</ref> one that precludes the polygamy and concubinage common to cultures before the arrival of Christianity. The equality of men and women reflected in the Church teaching that the sexes are meant by divine design to be different and complementary, each having equal dignity and made in the image of God,<ref name="Kreeft, p. 244">Kreeft, p. 244</ref> was also a countercultural concept. The Church is criticized for its policies regarding women priests and birth control which are viewed by some as discriminatory towards women.  . 

==Historical overview==. 
===Roman Empire===. 
Social structures at the dawn of Christianity in the Roman Empire held that women were inferior to men intellectually and physically and were "naturally dependent". <ref name="Noble230"/> Athenian women were legally classified as children regardless of age and were the "legal property of some man at all stages in her life."<ref name="Stark104"/> Women in the Roman Empire had limited legal rights and could not enter professions. Female infanticide and abortion were practiced by all classes. <ref name="Stark104"/> In family life, men, not women, could have "lovers, prostitutes and concubines" and it was not rare for pagan women to be married before the age of puberty and then forced to consummate the marriage with her often much older husband. Husbands, not wives, could divorce at any time simply by telling the wife to leave. The spread of Christianity changed women's lives in many ways by requiring a man to have only one wife and keep her for life, condemning the infidelity of men as well as women and doing away with marriage of prepubescent girls. <ref name="Noble230"/> Because Christianity outlawed infanticide and because women were more likely than men to convert, there were soon more Christian women than men whereas the opposite was true among pagans. <ref name="Stark104"/> . 

===Europe===. 
====Middle Ages====. 
During the Middle Ages, sexual activity was regulated much differently than it is currently. The medieval Catholic Church regulated sex and all matters relating to sex very carefully, and often imposed harsh penances to punish wrong doers. Penances varied according to severity of the act committed, and also according to who committed the exploit. Most of the regulations were based on what the church considered sexual sins. However, due to the knowledge that people would inherently commit these sins, the church set up a system to absolve one’s sins, although enforcement sometimes wavered.  . 

Most of the sins the Catholic Church tried to fight against were based on their interpretation of the Bible, and surprisingly, many are still considered sins today, although they do not carry the same weight as they did in the Middle Ages. The church defined sin as a violation of any law of God, the Bible, or the church. <ref name=Brundage2>Brundage<sup>2</sup> p. 295</ref> Common sexual sins were premarital sex, adultery, masturbation, homosexuality, and bestiality. The church saw sex and other pleasurable experiences as evil and a source of sin, unless meant for procreation. <ref name=Brundage1>Brundage<sup>1</sup> p. 182</ref> Also, any non vaginal sex (oral, anal) in a non missionary position was seen as sinful. The church considered masturbation a sin against nature because the guilty party was acting as both a man and woman. <ref name=Payer>Payer p. 132</ref> Also, law required clerics to avoid any sort of sexually tinged entertainment. <ref name=Brundage3>Brundage<sup>3</sup> p. 247</ref> However, canon law did allow sex in a marriage, as long as it intended to procreate and not just provide pleasure, even though some saw sex, even in marriage, as sinful and impure. <ref name=Brundage1>Brundage <sup>1</sup>p. 154</ref> Procreation caused no sin according to the church, as did having sex with a spouse in order to not commit adultery.  Adultery, homosexuality, and masturbation were all seen as terrible sins by the church; therefore, they also called for the vast regulation. The church also went to great lengths to control sexual practice by married couples.  . 

Sexual regulation by the church accounted for a great amount of literature and time. The church saw regulation as necessary to maintain the welfare of society. <ref name=Brundage1>Brundage<sup>1</sup> p. 152</ref> Canon law banned premarital sex, lust, masturbation, adultery, bestiality, homosexuality, and any sort of sex outside of marriage. Ironically, prostitution was occasionally legal and encouraged by the church, mainly in the church because priests were not allowed wives so they typically kept many concubines, although it was considered a form of adultery. <ref name=Brundage2>Brundage<sup>2</sup> p. 298</ref> Adultery was broken up into various categories by the Statutes of Angers: prostitution and simple fornication, adultery, defloration of virgins, intercourse with nuns, incest, homosexuality, and incidental matters relating to sex such as looks, desires, touches, embraces, and kisses. <ref name=Payer>Payer p. 131</ref> Adultery was typically grounds for divorce for a man if his wife fornicated with another, but adultery was not seen as a crime, just as a sin. <ref name=Brundage1>Brundage<sup>1</sup>p.147</ref> Much of the church’s efforts were put toward controlling what was going on sexually in a marriage, especially regarding when a married couple could have sex. Sex was not allowed during pregnancy or menstruation, after a child birth, on Sunday, Wednesday, Friday, or Saturday, during each of the three Lents, feast days, quarterly ember days, or before communion. <ref name=Brundage1>Brundage<sup>1</sup> p.156-159</ref> The church also denounced “unnatural” sexual relations between those of the same sex and also married couples. <ref name=Brundage1>Brundage<sup>1</sup>p. 149</ref> Also, upon marrying, a couple could not enter a church for thirty days. <ref name=Hunter>Hunter p. 589</ref> . 

Due to human nature and the belief that all men sin (Romans 3:23), the Catholic Church provided means to absolve one’s sexual sins, so that they may become pure again. By applying penance to sin, the church gave people a way out. Penance was composed of 3 parts: interior sorrow, oral confession, and satisfaction through deeds. <ref name=Payer>Payer p.135</ref> Because not all sexual sins are public, a private confession sufficed to declare one guilt free. <ref name=Brundage4>Brundage<sup>4</sup> p. 23</ref> Penances varied in length depending on what sin was committed. Adultery called for anywhere from 1 year to 15 years, depending on the confessors judgment of the sin. Adultery between two unmarried people called for a much lighter penance than that with a cleric, and even worse was fornication outside of a marriage. A 100 day penance would typically be given for one who confessed to masturbating for the first time, whereas a year would be given for a repeat offender. <ref name=Brundage1>Brundage<sup>1</sup> p. 166</ref> Also, because sex in marriage solely for pleasure was prohibited, married couples had to pray frequently for these “daily sins.” <ref name=Hunter>Hunter p. 589</ref>  . 

Although the church developed very strict regulations on sexual activity that needed to be carried out to sustain the institutional and psychological structure of the Middle Ages, it had a hard time properly enforcing these regulations. Most violations occurred in the privacy of the bedroom, so the only witnesses to the sin were the guilty parties themselves, and they did not usually confess to such crimes. Also, the problem was widespread. Not only did the common people deviate from the rules, but the clerics themselves did not follow their own laws. <ref name=Brundage2>Brundage<sup>2</sup> p. 299</ref> In order to convict, accusation was required, and people didn’t usually enough proof to back up an accusation, as law basically required a confession, and there was always a chance that if there was not enough proof, the accuser would be charged with false accusations. Even though the system was not foolproof, the church did produce a large number of institutions to inform the public of the law of sexual practice, and also had an extensive system of courts to deal with sexual misbehavior. <ref name=Brundage2>Brundage<sup>2</sup> p. 305</ref> . 

Sexual offenses were punished in a variety of ways during the Middle Ages. <ref name=Kelly>Kelly p. 342</ref> There were numerous prosecutions for adultery, fornication, and other sexual offenses,<ref name=Brundage4>Brundage<sup>4</sup> p. 31</ref> but fornication was the most frequently prosecuted. <ref name="Brundage2"/> Fornication was seen as a serious sin and a canonical crime <ref name=Brundage5>Brundage<sup>5</sup> p. 41</ref> and those convicted were required to “pay fines and court costs,” <ref name=Brundage4>Brundage<sup>4</sup> p. 33</ref> and they were often subject to public humiliation. Public humiliation ranged from public confessions and requesting the forgiveness of the community (often by kneeling at the entrance of a church and begging those who entered for mercy),<ref name="Brundage2"/> to public whippings in the churchyard or marketplace,<ref name=Kelly>Kelly p. 374</ref> to being paraded around the church “bare-chested and bearing a lighted candle before Sunday Mass”. <ref name="Brundage4"/> Some offenders were made to wear special clothes while others were flogged. Numerous offenders had to fast or abstain from meat, wine, and sex for a set period of time. <ref name=Brundage6>Brundage<sup>6</sup> p. 152</ref> Other “punishments [ranged] from the cutting off of hair and pillory to prison and expulsion”. <ref name=Kelly>Kelly p. 375</ref> Those convicted of more serious sexual offenses were subject to removal from office, confinement in a monastery, or a forced pilgrimage.  . 

Not all punishments were equal; punishments for sexual crimes differed between genders and social classes. When convicted of adultery, it was more likely that males would be fined in church courts rather than publicly flogged like the convicted females. <ref name=Kelly>Kelly p. 374-5</ref> However, when the males began to be more strictly punished, the punishment for females also became more severe. While males were now publicly whipped, females had their heads shaved <ref name=Brundage2>Brundage<sup>2</sup> p. 296</ref>  and were subject to expulsion from their homes, separation from their children, and the confiscation of their dowry. The wounds of the male would heal over time, but the woman was reduced to “penury,”. <ref name=Brundage5>Brundage<sup>5</sup> p. 42</ref> She would often be forced to live in poverty for the remainder of her life. In one case, a woman was accused of sleeping around and was ordered to rid herself of guilt in front of seven witnesses. Her male counterpart, however, was subject to no punishment whatsoever. When a woman of a higher social status was convicted of the same crime, she was not required to purge herself of her guilt in front of any witnesses. The woman of a higher social class was allowed to repent in private. Common prostitutes of the time period were banned from churches, but there was little to no prosecution of their “male clientele”. <ref name=Kelly>Kelly p. 376</ref> However, the priests of the higher classes were punished most severely for sexual crimes. They were stripped of their rank, position, and income. <ref name=Brundage4>Brundage<sup>4</sup> p. 29</ref> The wife and children of the priest were thrown out of their house,<ref name=Brundage5>Brundage<sup>5</sup> p. 36</ref> and the priests could be thrown in a monastery for the remainder of their lives while their wife and kids were enslaved. <ref name="Brundage2"/> . 

===Latin America===. 
It was women, primarily Amerindian Christian converts who became the primary supporters of the Church. <ref name="Stearns65"/> Slavery and human sacrifice were both part of Latin American culture before the Europeans arrived. <ref name="Chadwick190"/> Spanish conquerors enslaved and sexually abused Indian women on a regular basis. <ref name="Stears66"/> Indian slavery was first abolished by [[Pope Paul III]] in the 1537 bull [[Sublimis Deus]] which confirmed that "their souls were as immortal as those of Europeans" and they should neither be robbed nor turned into slaves. <ref name="Chadwick190">Chadwick, Owen, ''The Reformation'', p. 190</ref><ref name=Johansen110>Johansen, p. 110, quote: "In the Papal bull ''Sublimis deus'' (1537), Pope Paul III declared that Indians were to be regarded as fully human, and that their souls were as immortal as those of Europeans. This edict also outlawed slavery of Indians in any form&nbsp;..."</ref><ref name="Koschorke290">Koschorke, p. 290</ref> While the Spanish military was known for its ill-treatment of Amerindian men and women, Catholic missionaries are credited with championing all efforts to initiate protective laws for the Indians and fought against their enslavement. <ref name="Woods135">Woods, p. 135. </ref><ref name="Koschorke287">Koschorke, p. 287. </ref> . 

The missionaries in Latin America felt that the Indians tolerated too much nudity and required them to wear clothes if they lived at the missions. Common Indian sexual practices such as premarital sex, adultery, polygamy, and incest were quickly deemed immoral by the missionaries and prohibited with mixed results. Indians who did not agree to these new rules either left the missions or actively rebelled. Women's roles were sometimes reduced to exclude positions previously enjoyed by women in religious ceremonies or society. <ref name="Stears66">Stearns, p.64&ndash;6</ref> . 

===Asia===. 
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}} . 

===Africa===. 
By and large the largest obstacle to evangelization of African people was the rampant practice of polygamy among the various populations. Africa was initially evangelized by Catholic monks of medieval Europe, and then by both Protestants and Catholics from the seventeenth century onward. Each of these evangelizing groups complained "incessantly" about African marriage customs. <ref>Hastings, p. 317</ref> . 

==Official Church teaching on marital love and sexual issues==. 
According to the Church, humans are sexual beings whose sexual identity extends beyond the body to the mind and soul. The sexes are meant by divine design to be different and complementary, each having equal dignity and made in the image of God. <ref name="Kreeft, p. 244"/> The sexual act is sacred within the context of the marital relationship that reflects a complete and life-long mutual gift of a man and a woman. <ref name="Kreeft245"/> Sexual sins thus violate not just the body but the person's whole being. <ref name="Kreeft245"/> In his 1995 book ''[[Crossing the Threshold of Hope]]'', [[John Paul II]] reflected on this concept by stating, <blockquote>"After all, young people are always searching for the beauty in love. They want their love to be beautiful. If they give in to weakness, following the models of behavior that can rightly be considered a 'scandal in the contemporary world' (and these are, unfortunately, widely diffused models), in the depths of their hearts they still desire a beautiful and pure love. This is as true of boys as it is of girls. Ultimately, they know that only God can give them this love. As a result, they are willing to follow Christ, without caring about the sacrifices this may entail. <ref>John Paul II, p. 123</ref></blockquote> . 

Like orthodox Judaism and Islam, the Catholic Church considers all sexual acts outside of marriage to be grave sins. The gravity of the sin {{"'}}excludes one from sacramental communion' until repented of and forgiven in sacramental confession". <ref name="Kreeft245">Kreeft, p. 245</ref> . 

===Vocation to chastity===. 
Church teaching on the sixth commandment includes a discussion on [[chastity]]. The Catechism calls it a "moral virtue&nbsp;...&nbsp;a gift from God, a grace, a fruit of spiritual effort."<ref name="USCAT405"/> Because the Church sees sex as more than just a physical act but rather one that affects both body and soul, it teaches that chastity is a virtue all people are called to acquire. <ref name="USCAT405"/> It is defined as the inner unity of a person's "bodily and spiritual being" that successfully integrates a person's sexuality with his or her "entire human nature". <ref name="USCAT405"/> To acquire this virtue one is encouraged to enter into the "long and exacting work" of self-mastery that is helped by friendships, God's grace, maturity and education "that respects the moral and spiritual dimensions of human life."<ref name="USCAT405">USCCB, pp. 405&ndash;406</ref>
The Catechism categorizes violations of the sixth commandment into two categories: "offenses against chastity" and "offenses against the dignity of marriage". <ref name="Cat2331"/> . 

====Offenses against chastity====. 
The Catechism lists the following "offenses against chastity"<ref name="Cat2331">{{cite web | last =Paragraph number 2331&ndash;2400 | title =Catechism of the Catholic Church | publisher = Libreria Editrice Vaticana| year = 1994| url = http://www.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm|accessdate=27 December 2008}}</ref> in increasing order of gravity according to Kreeft:<ref name="Kreeft247">Kreeft, pp. 247&ndash;248</ref>
# Lust: the Church teaches that sexual pleasure is good and created by God who meant for spouses to "experience pleasure and enjoyment of body and spirit." Lust does not mean sexual pleasure as such, nor the delight in it, nor the desire for it in its right context. <ref>Kreeft, p. 246</ref> Lust is the desire for sex that seeks the pleasure of it apart from its intended purpose of procreation and the uniting of man and woman, body and soul, in mutual self-donation. <ref name="Kreeft247"/>
# Masturbation is considered sinful for the same reasons as lust but is a step above lust in that it now involves a physical act instead of just a mental one. <ref name="Kreeft247"/>
# Fornication is the sexual union of an unmarried man and an unmarried woman. This is considered contrary to the dignity of persons and of human sexuality because it is not ordered to the good of spouses or the generation and education of children. <ref name="Kreeft247"/>
# Pornography ranks yet higher on the scale in gravity of sinfulness because it is considered a perversion of the sexual act which is intended for distribution to third parties for viewing. <ref name="Kreeft247"/>
# Prostitution is sinful for both the prostitute and the customer; it reduces a person to an instrument of sexual pleasure, violating human dignity and harming society as well. The gravity of the sinfulness is less for prostitutes who are forced into the act by destitution, blackmail or social pressure. <ref name="Kreeft247"/>
# Rape is an intrinsically evil act that can cause grave damage to the victim for life. 
# Incest, or "rape of children by parents or other adult relatives" or "those responsible for the education of the children entrusted to them" is considered the most heinous of sexual sins. <ref name="Cat2331"/><ref name="Kreeft247"/> . 

====Homosexuality====. 
The Catechism devotes a separate section to homosexuality within its explanation of the sixth commandment. The Church distinguishes between homosexual attractions, which are not considered sinful, and homosexual acts, which are considered sinful. Like all heterosexual acts outside of marriage, homosexual acts are considered sins against this commandment. The Catechism states that they "violate natural law, cannot bring forth life, and do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved."<ref name="Cat2357"/><ref>Schreck, p. 314</ref> The Church teaches that a homosexual inclination is "objectively disordered" and can be a great trial for the person for whom the Church teaches must be "accepted with respect, compassion and sensitivity&nbsp;...&nbsp;unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided."<ref name="Cat2357"/><ref name="Kreeft249">Kreeft, p. 249</ref> . 

The homosexual person is, according to the Church, "called to chastity". They are instructed to practice the virtues of "self-mastery" that teaches "inner freedom" using the support of friends, prayer and grace found in the sacraments of the Church. <ref name="Cat2357"/> These tools are meant to help the homosexually inclined person to "gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection", which is a state to which all Christians are called. <ref name="Cat2357">{{cite web | last =Paragraph number 2357&ndash;2359 | title =Catechism of the Catholic Church | publisher = Libreria Editrice Vaticana| year = 1994| url = http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm|accessdate=27 December 2008}}</ref> . 

Within the Church community, two different lay movements exist that represent opposing philosophies. The first group called [[DignityUSA]], seeks to change the Church's teachings to justify homosexual acts. The second, [[Courage International]], is an organization of homosexuals who "support each other in the sincere effort to live in chastity and in fidelity to Christ and his Church."<ref name="Kreeft249"/> . 

===Love of husband and wife===. 
[[Image:Weddingring-JH.jpg|thumb|The sixth commandment, according to the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|USCCB]], "summons spouses" to an emotional and sexual fidelity they call "essential" to marriage and is reflective of God's "fidelity to us". <ref name="USCCB p. 405"/>]] . 

Spousal love, according to Church teaching, is meant to achieve an unbroken, twofold end: union of husband and wife as well as transmission of life. <ref name="USCAT408"/> The unitive aspect includes a person's whole being that calls spouses to grow in love and fidelity "so that they are no longer two but one flesh". <ref name="USCAT408"/> The [[Catholic marriage|sacrament of matrimony]] is viewed as God's sealing of spousal consent to the gift of themselves to each other. Church teaching on the marital state requires spousal acceptance of each other's failures and faults and the recognition that the "call to holiness in marriage" is one that requires a process of spiritual growth and conversion that can last throughout life. <ref name="USCAT408">USCCB, p. 408</ref> . 

===Fecundity of marriage, sexual pleasure, birth control===. 
Throughout Church history, various Catholic thinkers have offered differing opinions on sexual pleasure. Some saw it as sinful, while others disagreed. <ref name="Ecstasy">Gardella, pp. 10–13</ref> There was no formal Church position in the matter until the 1546 Council of Trent decided that "[[concupiscence]]" invited sin but was "not formally sinful in itself". <ref name="Ecstasy"/> In 1679, Pope Innocent XI also weighed in by condemning "marital sex exercised for pleasure alone". <ref name="Ecstasy"/> The Church position on sexual activity can be summarized as: "sexual activity belongs only in marriage as an expression of total self&ndash;giving and union, and always open to the possibility of new life." Sexual acts in marriage are considered "noble and honorable" and are meant to be enjoyed with "joy and gratitude". <ref name="USCAT408">USCCB, p. 408</ref> . 

The existence of artificial methods of birth control predates Christianity; the Catholic Church as well as all Christian denominations condemned artificial methods of birth control throughout their respective histories. This began to change in the 20th century when the Church of England became the first to accept the practice in 1930. <ref name="Saunders">{{cite web | last =Saunders | first =William | title =Teachings about contraception found in Scripture | work =The Catholic Herald | publisher = | date =4 September 2008 | url =http://www.madisoncatholicherald.org/2008-09-04/columns.html | accessdate =13 May 2009 }}</ref> The Catholic Church responded to this new development by issuing the papal encyclical [[Casti Connubii]] on 31 December 1930. The 1968 papal encyclical [[Humanae Vitae]] is a reaffirmation of the Catholic Church's traditional view of marriage and marital relations and a continued condemnation of artificial [[contraception|birth control]]. <ref name="Saunders"/> . 

The Church encourages large families and sees this as a blessing. It also recognizes that responsible parenthood sometimes calls for reasonable spacing or limiting of births and thus considers [[natural family planning]] as morally acceptable but rejects all methods of artificial contraception. <ref name="Schreck315"/> The Church rejects all forms of [[Reproductive technology|artificial insemination and fertilization]] because such techniques divorce the sexual act from the creation of a child. The Catechism states, "A child is not something ''owed'' to one, but is a ''gift''&nbsp;…'the supreme gift of marriage{{'"}}. <ref name="Schreck315">Schreck, p. 315</ref> . 

Rejecting Church support for natural family planning as a viable form of birth control, some Church members and non-members criticize Church teachings that oppose artificial birth control as contributing to [[overpopulation]], and [[poverty]]. <ref>{{cite news | title =Is the Vatican wrong on population control? | publisher = BBC News| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/382895.stm | accessdate = 8 April 2009 | date=9 July 1999}}</ref> The Church's rejection of the use of [[condom]]s is especially criticized with respect to countries where the incidence of [[AIDS]] and [[HIV]] has reached epidemic proportions. The Church maintains that in countries like Kenya and Uganda, where behavioral changes are encouraged alongside condom use, greater progress in controlling the disease has been made than in those countries solely promoting condoms. <ref>{{cite web | last =Dugger | first =Carol | title =Why is Kenya's AIDS rate plummeting? | work =International Herald Tribune | date =18 May 2006 | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/05/18/news/aids.php|accessdate=21 February 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last =Wilson | first =Brenda | title =Study: Verbal Warnings Helped Curb AIDS in Uganda | publisher =National Public Radio | year =2004 | url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1869907|accessdate=15 August 2008}}</ref> . 

==Priesthood, religious life, celibacy==. 
In the Catholic Church, only men may become [[ordination|ordained]] clergy through the sacrament of [[Holy Orders]], as [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]], [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priests]] or [[deacon]]s.

The Church practice of celibacy is based on [[Jesus]]' example and his teaching as given in {{bibleverse||Matthew|19:11–12}} as well as the writings of St. Paul, who spoke of the advantages celibacy allowed a man in serving the Lord. <ref name="Schreck255">Schreck, p. 255. </ref> Celibacy was "held in high esteem" from the Church's beginnings. It is considered a kind of spiritual marriage with Christ, a concept further popularized by the early Christian theologian [[Origen]]. Clerical celibacy began to be demanded in the 4th century, including [[papal decretal]]s beginning with [[Pope Siricius]]. <ref name="Bokenkotter54">Bokenkotter, p. 54. </ref> In the 11th century, mandatory celibacy was enforced as part of efforts to reform the medieval church. <ref name="Bokenkotter145">Bokenkotter, p. 145. </ref> . 

The Catholic view is that since the [[twelve apostles]] chosen by Jesus were all male, only men may be ordained in the Catholic Church. <ref>{{cite web| last =Paragraph number 1577| title =Catechism of the Catholic Church| publisher = Libreria Editrice Vaticana| year = 1994| url = http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a6.htm#III|accessdate=8 February 2008}}</ref> While some consider this to be evidence of a discriminatory attitude toward women,<ref name="Bokenkotter496">Bokenkotter, p. 496. </ref> the Church believes that Jesus called women to different yet equally important vocations in Church ministry. <ref name="Benedict180">Pope Benedict XVI, pp. 180–181, quote: "The difference between the discipleship of the Twelve and the discipleship of the women is obvious; the tasks assigned to each group are quite different. Yet Luke makes clear—and the other Gospels also show this in all sorts of ways—that 'many' women belonged to the more intimate community of believers and that their faith-filled following of Jesus was an essential element of that community, as would be vividly illustrated at the foot of the Cross and the Resurrection."</ref> Pope John Paul II, in his apostolic letter Christifideles Laici, states that women have specific vocations reserved only for the female sex, and are equally called to be disciples of Jesus. <ref name="CFL">{{cite web| last =John Paul II| first =Pope| title =Christifideles Laici| publisher =Vatican| year =1988| url =http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_jp-ii_exh_30121988_christifideles-laici_en.html|accessdate=17 March 2008}}</ref> This belief in different and complementary roles between men and women is exemplified in [[Pope Paul VI]]'s statement "If the witness of the Apostles founds the Church, the witness of women contributes greatly towards nourishing the faith of Christian communities". <ref name="CFL"/> .

==Spiritual affection==. 
[[File:Estasi di Santa Teresa.jpg|250px|left|thumb|[[Ecstasy of St Theresa|The Ecstasy of St Teresa]] in the basilica [[Santa Maria della Vittoria]] in Rome. By an [[Italy|Italian]] [[baroque]] artist, [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]].]]
Spiritual affection has long been documented in various lives of the saints. Biographies of [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Teresa of Avila]], [[Martin de Porres]], [[Joseph of Cupertino]] and many others include episodes of spiritual affection witnessed both by others who knew the saint or confessed by the saints themselves in their own writings. In Saint Teresa's ''Life'' for instance, she describes what has become known as the [[Ecstasy of Saint Theresa]]: <blockquote> "It is a caressing of love so sweet which now takes place between the soul and God, that I pray God of His goodness to make him experience it who may think that I am lying. During the days that this lasted, I went about as if beside myself. I wished to see, or speak with, no one, but only to cherish my pain, which was to me a greater bliss than all created things could give me. I was in this state from time to time, whenever it was our Lord's pleasure to throw me into those deep trances, which I could not prevent even when I was in the company of others, and which, to my deep vexation, came to be publicly known."<ref>{{cite web | last =Teresa of Avila | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Life| work = | publisher =Christian Classics Ethereal Library | date = | url =http://www.ccel.org/ccel/teresa/life.viii.xxx.html | doi = | accessdate =29 May 2009 }}</ref></blockquote> .
