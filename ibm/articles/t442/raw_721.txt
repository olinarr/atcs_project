The  '''''Catechism of the Catholic Church''''' (or '''''CCC''''') is the official text of the teachings of the [[Catholic Church]]. A provisional, "reference text" was issued by [[Pope John Paul II]] on October 11, 1992—"the thirtieth anniversary of the opening of the [[Second Vatican Ecumenical Council]]"—with his [[apostolic constitution]], ''[[Fidei depositum]]''. <ref name="FIDEI DEPOSITUM">{{cite web | url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19921011_fidei-depositum_en.html | title=FIDEI DEPOSITUM
 | accessdate=2007-10-05 | date=1992-10-11 | publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana}}</ref>
The new Catechism was first published<ref>Copyright 1994, Libreria Editrice Vaticana, Citta del Vaticano. </ref> in the French language in 1994 and was then translated into many other languages. <ref>In the United States, the English translation was published by the U.S. bishops in 1994 (copyright 1994, United States Catholic Conference, Inc., Libreria Editrice Vaticana), with a note that it was "subject to revision according to the Latin typical edition (''editio typica'') when it is published." (From the Copyright Information, pg. ii.)</ref> . 

On August 15, 1997—the [[Solemnity]] of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary]]—Pope John Paul II promulgated the [[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]] typical edition, with his [[apostolic letter]], ''Laetamur Magnopere''. <ref>The Latin-text copyright is 1994, 1997, Libreria Editrice Vaticana, Citta del Vaticano. </ref> The Latin text, which became the official text of reference (''editio typica''),<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/JP2LAETM.HTM | title=LATIN EDITION OF CATECHISM PROMULGATED | accessdate=2007-10-05 | date=1997-09-17 | publisher=[[L'Osservatore Romano]]}}</ref> amended the contents of the provisional French text at a few points. <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/updates.htm | title=MODIFICATIONS from the Edito Typica | accessdate=2007-10-05 | publisher=Amministrazione Del Patrimonio Della Sede Apostolica}}</ref> As a result, the earlier translations from the French into other languages (including English) had to be amended and re-published as "second editions". <ref>In the U.S., the bishops then published a new English translation, from the official Latin text. (English translation of the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church: Modifications from the Editio Typica'', copyright 1997, United States Catholic Conference, Inc.—Libreria Editrice Vaticana.) The U.S. bishops added a "Glossary and ''Index Analyticus''" (copyright 2000, United States Catholic Conference, Inc.) and published the new translation, with glossary and index, as the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church, Second Edition,'' "revised in accordance with the official Latin text promulgated by Pope John Paul II". (From the title page.)</ref> . 

The ''Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church'' was published in 2005, and the first edition in English in 2006. It is a more concise and [[dialogic]] version of the CCC. The text is available in twelve languages on the Vatican website,<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc/index.htm Vatican website]</ref> which also gives the text of the Catechism itself in nine languages.  . 

== Contents ==. 
A [[catechism]] has been defined as "a summary of principles, often in question-and-answer format". <ref>[http://www.bennetyee.org//http_webster.cgi?catechism&method=exact]</ref> Documents of religious instruction have been written since the beginning of Christianity and the catechism is typically an assemblage of these smaller documents into one large compilation of Church doctrine and teachings.  . 

The Catechism of the Catholic Church, for which the usual English-language abbreviation is ''CCC'',{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} is instead a source on which to base such catechisms (e.g. ''[[Youcat]]'' and the ''[[United States Catholic Catechism for Adults | U.S. Catholic Catechism for Adults]]'') and other expositions of Catholic doctrine, called a "major catechism." It was given, as stated in the [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''[[Fidei depositum]]'',<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19921011_fidei-depositum_en.html]</ref> with which its publication was ordered, "that it may be a sure and authentic reference text for teaching catholic doctrine and particularly for preparing local catechisms." The ''CCC'' is in fact not in question and answer format. What corresponds the more common idea of a catechism is perhaps the ''Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} . 

''CCC'' is arranged in four principal parts:
* The Profession of Faith (the [[Apostle's Creed]])
* The Celebration of the Christian Mystery (the Sacred [[Liturgy]], especially the [[sacrament]]s)
* Life in Christ (including [[The Ten Commandments in Roman Catholic theology]])
* Christian Prayer (including [[Lord's Prayer|The Lord's Prayer]]) . 

This scheme is often referred to as the “Four Pillars” of the Faith.  The contents are abundantly footnoted with references to sources of the teaching, in particular the [[Bible|Scriptures]], the [[Church Fathers]], and the [[Ecumenical council|Ecumenical Councils]] <ref>[http://www.usccb.org/catechism/resource/lev94art.htm#structure]</ref> and other authoritative Catholic statements, principally those issued by recent Popes.  . 

The section on Scripture in the ''CCC'' (nos. 101–141) recovers the Patristic tradition of "spiritual [[exegesis]]" as further developed through the scholastic doctrine of the "four senses." This return to spiritual exegesis is based on the Second Vatican Council's 1965 "Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation",<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html "Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation"]</ref> which taught that Scripture should be "read and interpreted in light of the same Spirit by whom it was written" (''Dei Verbum'' 12). The ''CCC'' amplifies ''Dei Verbum'' by specifying  that the necessary spiritual interpretation should be sought through the  four senses of Scripture (nos. 111, 113, 115–119),<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PQ.HTM (nos. 111, 113, 115–119)]</ref> which encompass the literal sense and the three spiritual senses (allegorical, moral, and anagogical).  . 

The literal sense (no. 116) pertains to the meaning of the words themselves, including any figurative meanings. The spiritual senses (no. 117) pertain to the significance of the things (persons, places, objects or events) denoted by the words. Of the three spiritual senses, the allegorical sense is foundational. It relates persons, events, and institutions of earlier covenants to those of later covenants, and especially to the New Covenant. Building on the allegorical sense, the moral sense instructs in regard to action, and the anagogical sense points to man's final destiny. The teaching of the ''CCC'' on Scripture has encouraged the recent pursuit of [[Covenantal Theology (Roman Catholic)|covenantal theology]], an approach that employs the four senses to structure salvation history via the biblical covenants.  . 

== Points of controversy ==. 
American Catholic bishops have stated that, though theological opinion was not intended to be a part of ''CCC'',<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.usccb.org/catechism/resource/lev94art.htm#structure | title=The New Catechism: An Overview | accessdate=2007-10-05 | date=1994-02-07 |publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops Office for the Catechism | last=Levada | first=Archbishop William J. |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929103226/http://www.usccb.org/catechism/resource/lev94art.htm#structure <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-29}}</ref> it in fact "does not distinguish between matters of faith and theological opinion."<ref>{{cite book | first=Michael J. | last=Wrenn |coauthors=Whitehead, Kenneth D. | title=Flawed Expectations: The Reception of the Catechism of the Catholic Church | publisher=[[Ignatius Press]] | year=1996 | isbn=0-89870-591-6 | page=208}}</ref> . 

A commentator, quoting [[Pope Paul VI]] to the effect that the Catholic Church has made a conscious attempt to adopt "a more humble and fraternal attitude ... that of a search for the truth",<ref name="Amerio">{{cite book | first=Romano | last=Amerio | title=Iota Unum: A Study of Changes in the Catholic Church in the XXth Century | year=1996 | publisher=Sarto House | isbn=0-9639032-1-7}}</ref> claims that ''CCC'' displays a shift away from presenting dogma as fact and toward presenting the Catholic faith itself as a search for truth. Referring also to the statement in the Apostolic Constitution  ''Fidei Depositum'' that "the contents are often presented in a new way in order to respond to the questions of our age," he claims that the "new catechesis…attempts to produce [[existentialism|existential]] reactions rather than intellectual conviction."<ref name="Amerio"/> . 

== Commentary == . 

[[Pope John Paul II]] declared the Catechism of the Catholic Church to be universally authoritative and ''"a sure norm for teaching the faith"'' and thus ''"a valid and legitimate instrument for ecclesial communion"''. <ref name="FIDEI DEPOSITUM"/>  .

{{cquote|It clearly show[s] that the problem of what we must do as human beings, of how we should live our lives so that we and the world may become just, is the essential problem of our day, and basically of all ages. After the fall of ideologies, the problem of man—the moral problem—is presented to today's context in a totally new way: What should we do? How does life become just? What can give us and the whole world a future which is worth living? Since the catechism treats these questions, it is a book which interests many people, far beyond purely theological or ecclesial circles.}} .
