'''[[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]''' is a major public health concern and cause of death in many parts of '''[[Africa]]'''. Although Africa is home to about 14.5% of the world's population, it is estimated to be home to 69% of all people living with HIV and to 72% of all AIDS deaths in 2009. <ref name="UNAIDS 2010"/> .

The [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS]] (UNAIDS) has predicted outcomes for the region to the year 2025. These range from a plateau and eventual decline in deaths beginning around 2012 to a catastrophic continual growth in the death rate with potentially 90 million cases of infection.  . 

Without the kind of health care and medicines (such as [[antiretrovirals]]) that are available in developed countries, large numbers of people in Africa will develop [[AIDS]]. They will not only be unable to work, but will also require significant medical care. This will likely cause a collapse of economies and societies.  . 

In an article titled "Death Stalks A Continent", Johanna McGeary attempts to describe the severity of the issue. “Society's fittest, not its frailest, are the ones who die—adults spirited away, leaving the old and the children behind. You cannot define risk groups: everyone who is sexually active is at risk. Babies too, [are] unwittingly infected by mothers. Barely a single family remains untouched. Most do not know how or when they caught the virus, many never know they have it, many who do know don't tell anyone as they lie dying”. <ref name="McGeary">{{cite news |title=Death stalks a continent |first=Johanna |last=McGeary |newspaper=Time Magazine |date=12 Feb 2001 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,999190-12,00.html}}</ref> . 

==Origins of AIDS in Africa==. 
Recent theories have linked the earliest known cases of AIDS to west Africa. The predominant feature of this first period was silence. Hypotheses include linking the disease to the preparation for consumption of [[bushmeat]] in [[Cameroon]], or sexual contact with monkeys, with this last hypothesis being met with skepticism, as this is an extremely uncommon practice in African countries. Current hypotheses also include colonial medical practices of mid-20th-century which, once the virus made the jump from chimpanzees or other apes to humans, may have helped HIV become established in human populations around 1930. <ref name="npr.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5450391 |title=Origin of AIDS Linked to Colonial Practices in Africa |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2011-03-29}}</ref> It is highly probable that this is where the disease originated since early cases of it have been traced back to colonial Africa in the rubber plantations but no scientific evidence has been found.  . 

==History==. 
Although many governments in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] denied that there was a problem for years, they have now begun to work toward solutions.  . 

Health spending in Africa has never been adequate, either before or after independence.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The health care systems inherited from [[colonialism|colonial powers]] were oriented toward curative treatment rather than preventative programs.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Strong prevention programs are the cornerstone of effective national responses to AIDS, and the required changes in the health sector have presented huge challenges.  . 

The global response to HIV and AIDS has improved considerably in recent years. Funding comes from many sources, the largest of which are the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the US initiative known as PEPFAR{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.  . 

==Causes and spread==. 
===Cultural factors===. 
It has been argued <ref>{{cite journal | last=Linke | first=Uli | title = AIDS in Africa | journal = Science | volume = 231 | pages = 203 | date = January 1986 }}</ref> that the practice of [[female circumcision]] has led to an increased incidence of AIDS in Africa, since intercourse with a circumcised female is conducive to an exchange of blood.  . 

===Political factors===. 
Major African political leaders have denied the link between HIV and AIDS, favoring alternate theories. <ref>{{cite web|author=Mark Schoofs |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2000-07-04/news/debating-the-obvious/ |title=Debating the Obvious&nbsp;— Page 1 - News&nbsp;— New York |publisher=Village Voice |date=2000-07-04 |accessdate=2012-02-21}}</ref> The scientific community considers the evidence that HIV causes AIDS to be conclusive and rejects [[AIDS denialism|AIDS-denialist]] claims as pseudoscience based on conspiracy theories, faulty reasoning, cherry picking, and misrepresentation of mainly outdated scientific data. Despite its lack of scientific acceptance, AIDS denialism has had a significant political impact, especially in South Africa under the former presidency of [[Thabo Mbeki]].  . 

===Medical suspicion===. 
There are high levels of medical suspicion throughout Africa, and there is evidence that such distrust may have a significant impact on the use of medical services. <ref>Savelsberg PF, Ndonko FT, Schmidt-Ehry B. Sterilizing vaccines or the politics of the womb: Retrospective study of a rumor in the Cameroon. Medical Anthropology Quarterly. 2000;14:159-179. </ref><ref>Clements CJ, Greenough P, Shull D. How vaccine safety can become political&nbsp;— the example of polio in Nigeria. Current Drug Safety. 2006;1:117-119. </ref> The distrust of modern medicine is sometimes linked to theories of a "Western Plot"<ref>UNICEF "Combating anti-vaccination rumors: Lessons learned from case studies in Africa" http://www.path.org/vaccineresources/files/Combatting_Antivac_Rumors_UNICEF.pdf accessdate=2011-05-16</ref> of mass sterilization or population reduction, perhaps a consequence of several high profile incidents involving Western medical practitioners. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/31/opinion/31washington.html date=2007-07-31 accessdate=2011-05-16]</ref> . 

===Economic factors===. 
Lack of money is an obvious challenge, although a great deal of aid is distributed throughout developing countries with high HIV/AIDS rates. For African countries with advanced medical facilities, [[patent]]s on many drugs have hindered the ability to make low cost alternatives. <ref name="ReferenceA">Susan Hunter, "Black Death: AIDS in Africa" , Palrave Macmillan 2003 chapter 2</ref> [[VaxGen]], a California company, has come up with the most advanced vaccine called [[AIDSVAX]], but this has only been found effective in the Asian and black populations, thus<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="Washington, Harriet pp 300-330">Washington, Harriet. Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Medical Experimentation on Black Americans from Colonial Times to the Present , Anchor books, New York pp 300-330</ref> funding for further research for this has been lacking since money cannot be obtained from poor African governments, and once it is found, the vaccine would not be able to be made, the costs would be prohibitive to poor Asian and Africans{{Clarify|date=November 2010}}. <ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="Washington, Harriet pp 300-330"/> . 

Natural disasters and conflict are also major challenges, as the resulting economic problems people face can drive many young women and girls into patterns of sex work in order to ensure their livelihood or that of their family, or else to obtain safe passage, food, shelter or other resources. <ref name="ODIhiv">Samuels, Fiona (2009) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2645&title=hiv-aids-emergencies HIV and emergencies: one size does not fit all],  London: Overseas Development Institute</ref>  Emergencies can also lead to new patterns of sex work, for instance, in [[Mozambique]] the influx of humanitarian workers and transporters, such as truck drivers, can cause sex workers to move to the area. <ref name="ODIhiv" /> In northern [[Kenya]], for instance, drought has led to a decrease in clients for sex workers, and the result is that sex workers are less able to resist their clients' refusal to wear condoms. <ref name="ODIhiv" /> . 

===Pharmaceutical industry===. 
African countries are also still fighting against what they perceive as unfair practices in the international pharmaceutical industry. <ref name="ReferenceB">Meier,Benjamin Mason: International Protection of Persons Undergoing Medical Experimentation: Protecting the Right of Informed Consent, Berkeley journal of international law [1085-5718] Meier yr:2002 vol:20 iss:3 pg:513 -554</ref> Medical experimentation occurs in Africa on many medications, but once approved, access to the drug is difficult. <ref name="ReferenceB"/> Drug companies are often concerned with making a return on the money they invested on the research and obtain patents that keep the prices of the medications high. Patents on medications have prevented access to medications as well as the growth in research for more affordable alternatives. These pharmaceuticals insist that drugs should be purchased through them.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} South African scientists in a combined effort with American scientists from [[Gilead]] recently came up with an AIDS gel that is 40% effective in women as announced in a study conducted at the [[University of KwaZulu-Natal]] in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]]. This is a groundbreaking drug and will soon be made available to Africans and people abroad.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The South African government has indicated its willingness to make it widely available.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The FDA in the US is in the process of reviewing the drug for approval for US use. <ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.sagoodnews.co.za/health_and_hiv_aids/new_aids_gel_could_protect_women_from_hiv.html |title=New Aids gel could protect women from HIV |publisher=South Africa&nbsp;— The Good News&nbsp;— Sagoodnews.co.za |date=2010-07-20 |accessdate=2011-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Fox |first=Maggie |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE69Q10L20101027 |title=Groups moving forward to develop AIDS gel |publisher=Reuters |date= 2010-10-27|accessdate=2011-03-29}}</ref> The AIDS/HIV epidemic has led to the rise in unethical [[medical Experimentation in Africa]]. <ref name="ReferenceB"/> Since the epidemic is widespread, African governments relax their laws in order to get research conducted in their countries which they would otherwise not afford. <ref name="ReferenceB"/>  However, global organizations such as the [[Clinton Foundation]], are working to reduce the cost of HIV/AIDS medications in Africa and elsewhere.  For example, [[Inder Singh (philanthropist)|Inder Singh]] oversaw a program which reduced the cost of pediatric HIV/AIDS drugs by 80 to 92% by working with manufacturers to reduce production and distribution costs. <ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD7keapMjHc |title=Inder Singh, Executive Vice President for the Clinton Foundation, on Expanding Access to Health Care |publisher=Wharton Magazine |date=2011-03-29 |accessdate=2011-08-10}}</ref>  Manufacturers often cite distribution and production difficulties in developing markets, which create a substantial barrier to entry.  . 

===Health industry===. 
When family members get sick with HIV or other sicknesses, family members often end up selling most of their belongings in order to provide health care for the individual. Medical facilities in many African countries are lacking. Many health care workers are also not available, in part due to lack of training by governments and in part due to the wooing of these workers by foreign medical organisations where there is a need for medical professionals. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/davidhshinn/Home/african-migration-and-the-brain-drain |title=African Migration and the Brain Drain&nbsp;— David Shinn |publisher=Sites.google.com |date=2008-06-20 |accessdate=2011-03-29}}</ref> This is done largely through immigration laws that encourage recruitment in professional fields (special skill categories) like doctors and nurses in countries like Australia, Canada, and the U.S.  . 

====Brain drain====. 
{{main article|Brain drain#Africa}}
The African health care industry has been hard hit by a [[brain drain]]. Many qualified doctors, nurses or other health care professionals emigrate to other countries. For example, in [[Malawi]], the [[University of Malawi]] graduates medical doctors that end up working abroad. This is illustrated when at a certain point, there were more Malawian doctors in [[Manchester]] than in the entire country of Malawi. <ref>{{cite web|title=Health systems in Malawi|url=http://www.ruderfinn.co.uk/blogs/dotorg/2009/01/health-systems-in-malawi/|publisher=Ruder Finn blog|accessdate=2 November 2010}}</ref><ref>Robert L Broadhead and Adamson S Muula (2002, August). Creating a medical school for Malawi: problems and achievements. BMJ. 2002 August 17; 325(7360): 384–387 - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1123892/</ref> . 

====Other reasons====. 
Response to the epidemic is also hampered by lack of infrastructure, corruption within both donor agencies and government agencies, foreign donors not coordinating with local government, and misguided resources{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.  . 

==Measurement==. 
Prevalence measures include everyone living with HIV and AIDS, and present a delayed representation of the epidemic by aggregating the HIV infections of many years. Incidence, in contrast, measures the number of new infections, usually over the previous year. There is no practical, reliable way to assess incidence in sub-Saharan Africa. Prevalence in 15–24 year old pregnant women attending [[prenatal care|antenatal clinics]] is sometimes used as an approximation. The test done to measure prevalence is a serosurvey in which blood is tested for the presence of HIV.  . 

Health units that conduct serosurveys rarely operate in remote rural communities, and the data collected also does not measure people who seek alternate healthcare. Extrapolating national data from antenatal surveys relies on assumptions which may not hold across all regions and at different stages in an epidemic.  . 

Recent national population or household-based surveys collecting data from both sexes, pregnant and non-pregnant women, and rural and urban areas, have adjusted the recorded national prevalence levels for several countries in Africa and elsewhere{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. These, too, are not perfect: people may not participate in household surveys because they fear they may be HIV positive and do not want to know their test results. Household surveys also exclude migrant labourers, who are a high risk group.  . 

Thus, there may be significant disparities between official figures and actual HIV prevalence in some countries.  . 

A minority of scientists claim that as many as 40% of HIV infections in African adults may be caused by unsafe medical practices rather than by sexual activity. <ref>[http://www.africaaction.org/docs02/hiv0210t.htm Africa: HIV/AIDS through Unsafe Medical Care]. Africaaction.org. Retrieved on 2010-10-25. </ref> The World Health Organization states that about 2.5% of AIDS infections in sub-Saharan Africa are caused by unsafe medical injection practices and the "overwhelming majority" by unprotected sex. <ref>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2003/statement5/en/ WHO | Expert group stresses that unsafe sex is primary mode of transmission of HIV in Africa]. Who.int (2003-03-14). Retrieved on 2010-10-25. </ref> . 

==Regional analysis==. 
[[File:Comparison subsaharan life expectancy.svg|thumb|250px|Graphs of life expectancy at birth for some sub-Saharan countries showing the fall in the 1990s primarily due to the AIDS pandemic. <ref>[http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN/countries/1W The World Bank - Life expectancy at birth, total (years)]</ref>]] . 

===North Africa===. 
The HIV prevalence rates in [[North Africa]] are among the lowest in the world. This is primarily attributed to the salient role of [[Islam]] in the region's societies, which has kept infection rates at a negligible level through the faith's strong influence on local mores, values and government policies. Extra-marital sexual relations are also fervently discouraged in the area's predominantly Muslim communities. Consequently, the HIV prevalence rates in 2009 were less than 0.1% in [[Egypt]] and [[Tunisia]], 0.1% in [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]], 0.7% in [[Mauritania]], and 1.1% in [[Sudan]]. <ref name="UNAIDS 2010"/> . 

===Horn of Africa===. 
As with North Africa, the HIV infection rates in the [[Horn of Africa]] are generally quite low. This has been attributed to the Muslim nature of many of the local communities and adherence to Islamic morals. <ref name="RCTHIV"/> The HIV prevalence rates in 2009 were estimated at 0.7% in [[Somalia]], 0.8% in [[Eritrea]], and 2.5% in [[Djibouti]]. <ref name="UNAIDS 2010"/> [[Ethiopia]]'s rate in 2003 was estimated at 4.4%. <ref name="RCTHIV"/> . 

===East and Central Africa===. 
By contrast with the predominantly Muslim areas in North Africa and the Horn region, traditional cultures and religions in much of Sub-Saharan Africa have generally exhibited a more liberal attitude vis-a-vis female out-marriage sexual activity. The latter includes practices such as multiple sexual partners and unprotected sex, high-risk cultural patterns that have been implicated in the much greater spread of HIV in the region. <ref name="RCTHIV">{{cite web|url=http://ams.ac.ir/aim/07104/0012.pdf |title=Religious and cultural traits in HIV/AIDS epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-06-27}}</ref> . 

HIV infection rates in [[East Africa|East]] and [[Central Africa]] are generally moderate to high. [[Uganda]] has registered a gradual decrease in its HIV rates from 10.6% in 1997, to a stabilized 6.5%-7.0% since 2001. <ref name="RCTHIV"/><ref name="UNAIDS 2010"/> This has been attributed to changing local behavioral patterns, with more respondents reporting greater use of contraceptives and a two-year delay in first sexual activity as well as fewer people reporting casual sexual encounters and multiple partners. <ref name="RCTHIV"/> Similarly, the HIV infection rate in [[Kenya]] dropped from around 14% in the mid-1990s to 5% in 2006. Between 2004-2008, [[Tanzania]] had a prevalence rate of 3.4%, with [[Rwanda]] maintaining a regional low of about 3.0% since 2005. <ref name="UNAIDS 2010"/> .

===West Africa===. 
Countries in Western Africa include [[Senegal]], [[The Gambia]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Guinea]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Ghana]], [[Togo]], [[Benin]], [[Cameroon]], [[Nigeria]], and the landlocked states of [[Mali]], [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Niger]].  . 

The region has generally high levels of infection of both [[subtypes of HIV|HIV-1 and HIV-2]]. The onset of the HIV epidemic in west Africa began in 1985 with reported cases in Côte d'Ivoire, Benin and Mali{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Cameroon, Senegal and Liberia followed in 1986. Sierra Leone, Togo and Niger in 1987; The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, and Guinea in 1989; and finally Cape Verde in 1990.  . 

HIV prevalence in west Africa is lowest in Chad, Niger and Mali, and highest in Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire and Nigeria. Nigeria has the second largest number of people living with HIV in Africa after [[South Africa]], although the infection rate (number of patients relative to the entire population) based upon Nigeria's estimated population is much lower, generally believed to be well under 7%, as opposed to South Africa's which is well into the double-digits (nearer 30%).{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} . 

The main driver of infection in the region is [[prostitution|commercial sex]]. In the [[Ghana]]ian capital [[Accra]], for example, 80% of HIV infections in young men had been acquired from women who sell sex{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. In [[Niger]], the adult national HIV prevalence was 1% in 2003, yet surveys of sex workers in different regions found a HIV infection rate of between 9 and 38%{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.  .

===Southern Africa===. 
In the mid-1980s, HIV and AIDS were virtually unheard of in southern Africa; it is now the worst-affected region in the world. Of the eleven southern African countries ([[Angola]], [[Namibia]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Botswana]], [[Malawi]], [[Mozambique]], [[South Africa]], [[Lesotho]], [[Swaziland]], [[Madagascar]]) at least seven are estimated to have an infection rate of over 15%. <ref name="indexmundi.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?v=32 |title=HIV/AIDS&nbsp;— adult prevalence rate&nbsp;— Country Comparison |publisher=Indexmundi.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-21}}</ref> [[Angola]] presents one of the lowest infection rates at 2.1%. <ref name="indexmundi.com"/> This is not the result of a successful national response to the threat of AIDS but of the long-running [[Angolan Civil War]] (1975–2002){{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.  . 

Aside from polygynous relationships, which can be quite prevalent in parts of Africa{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, there are also widespread practices of sexual networking that involve multiple overlapping or concurrent sexual partners. <ref>Poku, N. K. and Whiteside, A. (2004) 'The Political Economy of AIDS in Africa', 235. </ref> Men’s sexual networks, in particular, tend to be quite extensive, a fact that is tacitly accepted by many communities{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. Cultural or social norms often indicate that while women must remain faithful men are able and even expected to philander irrespective of their [[marital status]]. Along with the occurrence of multiple sexual partners, unemployment and population displacements that result from drought and conflict contribute to the spread of HIV/AIDS.  . 

There are a few indicators of countrywide declines in infection. In its December 2005 report, UNAIDS reports that Zimbabwe has experienced a drop in infections{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}; however, most independent observers find the confidence of UNAIDS in the [[Robert Mugabe|Mugabe]] government's HIV figures to be misplaced, especially since infections have continued to increase in all other southern African countries (with the exception of a possible small drop in Botswana). Almost 30% of the global number of people living with HIV live in an area where only 2% of the world's population reside{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.  . 

Most HIV infections found in southern Africa are [[subtypes of HIV|HIV-1]], the world's most common HIV infection, which predominates everywhere except west Africa, home to [[subtypes of HIV|HIV-2]]. The first cases of HIV in the region were reported in [[Zimbabwe]] in 1985{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.  . 

====Swaziland====. 
{{main|HIV/AIDS in Swaziland}}
The HIV infection rate in Swaziland is unprecedented and the highest in the world at 26.1% of all adults,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kff.org/hivaids/upload/7365-065.pdf |title=The HIV/AIDS Epidemic in South Africa&nbsp;— Fact Sheet |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-03-29}}</ref> and at over 50% of adults in their 20s. <ref name="undp.org.sz">Country programme outline for Swaziland, 2006-2010. United Nations Development Program. http://www.undp.org.sz/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_download&gid=19&Itemid=67. Retrieved November 22, 2009. </ref>  This  has stopped possible economic and social progress, and is at a point where it endangers the existence of its society as a whole. The United Nations Development Program has written that if the expansion continues unabated, the "longer term existence of Swaziland as a country will be seriously threatened". <ref name="undp.org.sz"/> . 

[[Swaziland#Health|Swaziland's HIV epidemic]] has reduced life expectancy to only 32 years as of 2009, which is the lowest in the world by six years. The next highest is 38 years in [[Angola]], also from HIV. From another perspective, HIV/AIDS currently causes 61% of all deaths in the country. With an unmatched crude death rate of 30 per 1,000 people per year, about 2% of Swaziland's total population dies of HIV/AIDS every year. <ref>[http://www.who.int/whosis/mort/profiles/mort_afro_swz_swaziland.pdf Swaziland, Mortality Country Fact Sheet] 2006. WHO. Retrieved November 22, 2009. </ref> . 

==Tuberculosis==. 
Much of the deadliness of the epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa has to do with a deadly synergy between HIV and [[tuberculosis]],<ref name="DUAL">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7074298.stm |title='Dual epidemic' threatens Africa |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-11-02 |accessdate=2011-03-29}}</ref> though this synergy is by no means limited to Africa.  In fact, tuberculosis is the world's greatest infectious killer of women of reproductive age and the leading cause of death among people with [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]. <ref>Stop TB Partnership. [http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=95088 London tuberculosis rates now at Third World proportions.] ''PR Newswire Europe Ltd.'' 4 December 2002. Retrieved on 3 October 2006. </ref> . 

Because HIV has destroyed the immune systems of at least a quarter of the population in some areas, far more people are not only developing tuberculosis but spreading it to otherwise healthy neighbours. <ref name="DUAL"/> . 

==Prevention efforts==. 
There are numerous initiatives and campaigns which have been used to curb the spread of HIV in Africa, such as the [[Abstinence, be faithful, use a condom]] or ABC campaign.  . 

One of the greatest problems many African countries face, due to high prevalence rates, is "HIV fatigue", where populations are not interested in hearing more about a disease they hear about constantly. In order to address this, novel approaches are often required. In 2011, the [[Education in Botswana|Botswana Ministry of Education]] will be introducing new HIV/AIDS educational technology for schools. The [[TeachAIDS]] prevention software, developed at [[Stanford University]], will be distributed to every primary, secondary, and tertiary educational institution in the country, reaching all learners from 6 to 24 years of age nationwide. <ref>{{cite web |title=UNICEF funds TeachAIDS work in Botswana|url=http://teachaids.org/blog/unicef-funds-teachaids-work-in-botswana/|work=TeachAIDS|date=2 June 2010|accessdate=24 January 2011}}</ref> .
