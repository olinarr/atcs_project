===Libertarian beginnings===. 
Before 1983, Rich was active in the Libertarian Party and worked with [[Charles Koch]] to promote small-government and free-market causes. <ref name=tws23nov211/> After 1983, Rich left the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian party]] and continued his activism with private groups. <ref name=tws23nov211/> In 1990, Rich and his wife Andrea took over the Libertarian Review Foundation, and renamed it the Center for Independent Thought. <ref name=tws23nov211/> Rich's wife was an owner of Laissez-Faire Books and was a trustee of the Atlas Economic Research Foundation. <ref name=tws23nov212/> While Rich has supported the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian party]], he is enrolled as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] so he can vote in primaries. <ref name=tws23nov22/> .

===Non-partisan activism===. 
In 1992, Rich met [[Bill Wilson (Americans for Limited Government)|Bill Wilson]] and the two worked together on a variety of causes. <ref name=tws23nov12/> Rich financed Wilson’s efforts at '''[[U.S. Term Limits]]''', Parents in Charge and '''[[Americans for Limited Government]]'''. <ref name=NOW/><ref name=tws23nov12/> Rich's associate Wilson describes these organizations not as [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] but rather as "rolling back the government."<ref name=tws23nov12/> Rich explained his mission was to "advance individual freedom and create an atmosphere where we restore the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founders']] concepts of [[Property|property rights]] and [[free markets]]."<ref name=tws23nov212/> Rich became more politically active in the movement to limit government beginning about 1992. <ref name=tws23nov113/> He has supported referendum measures that would limit government spending, curb the seizure of land and offer school vouchers. <ref name=tws23nov22/> He prefers underwriting ballot measures rather than lobbying in state capitols. <ref name=tws23nov212/> Rich explained: "Working with the state legislators is a fool’s errand" and added "Most of them are RINOs (Republicans in Name Only) who water things down to nothing."<ref name=tws23nov212/> . 

===Americans for Limited Government===.

===Property rights===. 
The [[Kelo v. New London]] [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision ruled that states could, at their discretion, decide whether it was permissible to permit property to be taken from some owners under the doctrine of [[eminent domain]] and given to other owners. There was a public backlash. <ref name=tws23nov11/> Rich helped engineer and encourage a number of ballot initiatives in state elections in 2006 to rein in such takings. Rich said "I believe that property rights in many respects have been taken away from many property owners."<ref name=tws23nov23/> Property rights referendums on 12 state ballots became the "biggest ballot issue" in 2006. <ref name=tws23nov24>{{cite news

'''Letters to donors controversy.''' In 2004, advocacy groups such as right-wing [[Swift Boat Veterans For Truth]]<ref name=tws24nov01/> and left-wing [[MoveOn.org]] played a role in the presidential election contest of 2004. 527 money kept [[John Kerry]] going after cash dried up after the convention, and 527 money paid for the "infamous [[Swift Boat Veterans for Truth|Swift boat]] ads, which painted Mr. Kerry’s military service in shameful hues, with little regard for documented history."<ref name=tws23nov22/> Questions about donations to these groups led to the [[Federal Election Commission]] sending subpoenas to donors requesting further information. <ref name=tws24nov01>{{cite news

}}</ref> According to an account in ''[[National Public Radio|NPR]]'', he was "watchdogging all those limousine liberals with their checkbooks". <ref name=tws23nov13/> Rich's letters to prominent liberal contributors of liberal causes told them that he's watching these donations; the letter read as follows: "As a donor to one or more of these organizations and efforts, you have been able to engage in these activities without notice, operating in relative obscurity ... I am writing to inform you that this will no longer be the case."<ref name=tws23nov13/> There was a threat of exposing donations which violated laws or which were being funneled for illegal purposes. <ref name=tws23nov13/> According to a newspaper account afterwards, the letters from both sides tried to discourage donors to so-called [[527 Organization|527 groups]] which is "lightly regulated money" that "swamped the 2004 election."<ref name=tws23nov22/> Both liberals left-wing groups such as [[Accountable America]] and advocates such as Rich were criticized for "trying to chill free speech" with efforts to intimidate donors to political causes. <ref name=tws23nov13/> . 

'''Motivation.''' In an interview in [[South Carolina]], a reporter asked Rich: "I don't know anyone who invests the kind of money without getting something in return?" Rich replied:
<blockquote>
There is great satisfaction. I went to public schools. My wife did. My two sons did. Here's an opportunity to give back something where kids will have an opportunity and parents will have an opportunity to go to a school of their choice not some school mandated by government. If every proposal that I have favored over the last 20 years got enacted, whether its term limits or school choice or property rights or any area -- I get no personal benefit out of it. I don't make a nickel. Here in [[South Carolina]] I own no property. I have no businesses down here. So there's no real monetary benefit. <ref name=tws23nov214>{{cite news
