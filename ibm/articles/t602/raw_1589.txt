==Gubernatorial campaign==. 
Munger, feeling that [[North Carolina]] voters needed an alternative to the two party duopoly, ran as a [[Libertarian Party of North Carolina|Libertarian]] candidate for [[Governor of North Carolina]] in [[North Carolina gubernatorial election, 2008|2008]]. 
Early in the year, Munger said that Democratic gubernatorial challenger [[Bev Perdue]] was a "[[Stepford Wife]]" and the Republican nominees were "circus clowns."<ref name="duke chronicle"/> Prior to May 2008, the North Carolina Libertarian Party and Munger gathered 100,000 signatures of voters in order to qualify to appear on North Carolina's ballot. They, along with the [[Green Party]], sued the state unsuccessfully over the ballot access rules. Munger appeared as an expert witness in other cases on behalf of the Green Party and the [[ACLU]]. <ref name="duke chronicle"/> . 

Munger appeared as one of two keynote speakers at the national Libertarian convention in [[Denver]] in May 2008. <ref name="duke chronicle"/> He later made history as the first third-party candidate to participate in a live, televised gubernatorial debate in North Carolina. <ref name="duke chronicle"/>  . 

The [[Progressivism|progressive]] ''[[Independent Weekly]]'' said of Munger: ''"Were there no substantive differences between the major-party candidates, we'd be recommending a protest vote for Libertarian Party candidate Michael C. Munger, based on the elements of his platform that make him the self-proclaimed '[[Liberalism (US)|liberal]] in the race.'"''<ref name="indy weekly">{{cite news

On election day Munger received 121,585 votes for 2.85% of the total vote.  . 

Following the election, [[Nick Gillespie]] of ''[[Reason magazine|Reason]]'' magazine wrote: "I humbly submit that Duke University political science professor Michael Munger, who ran a strong bid as an Libertarian Party candidate for governor in North Carolina, set his eyes toward an even bigger and remote target in [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012]], that stationary [[Death Star]] known as the [[White House]]."<ref>[[Nick Gillespie|Gillespie, Nick]] (2008-11-21) [http://reason.com/blog/2008/11/21/as-we-look-past-the-next-four As We Look Past the Next Four Years of Virtually Certain Unmitigated Crapitude, Here's a Couple of Thoughts on Election 2012], ''[[Reason magazine|Reason]]''</ref> . 

==Political positions==. 
Munger has made education a centerpiece of his gubernatorial campaign, saying that allowing more [[charter school]]s is the first thing he would do: "Rich people have choices now. I want everyone to have a choice."<ref name="charlotte observer">{{cite news 
  | title = McCrory, Perdue differ on charter schools

Munger has taken more [[Social liberalism|socially liberal]] positions on many issues than the Democratic candidate for governor, [[Bev Perdue]].  "One reason I haven't been allowed in all the debates is that I'm taking votes from the [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]]. Sixty percent of my supporters are voting for Obama. I'll talk about [[gay marriage]], and Perdue isn't, or doesn't want to."<ref name="reason"/>  While Democratic candidate Perdue has taken a hard line on [[illegal immigration]] similar to that of [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] [[Pat McCrory]], Munger has a position more aligned with [[Barack Obama]]. <ref name="wunc">{{cite news 
  | title = The State of Things: Issues Roundup | publisher = ''[[WUNC (FM)|WUNC]]'' | date = 2008-10-28 | url = http://wunc.org/tsot/archive/sot1028abc.mp3/view | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}</ref> . 

Munger is against the [[death penalty]] and believes children of [[illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrants]] should be allowed into [[University of North Carolina System]] schools and community colleges. <ref name="indy weekly"/> He believes that the government should do what it can to prevent illegal immigrants from entering the country, but once they are here, they should be treated fairly and given access to education or an "[[apartheid]]" will result "with fertile pickings for gang recruitment and exploitation by unscrupulous employers."<ref name="indy weekly"/> He believes that more rural roads should be built rather than "urban highways."<ref name="indy weekly"/> . 

Munger wants to decrease the size of government and lower taxes. <ref name="indy weekly"/> He opposes the [[North Carolina Education Lottery]] and would make income taxes more [[progressive tax|progressive]] while cutting regressive taxes. <ref name="indy weekly"/> .
