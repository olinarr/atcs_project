'''Milton Friedman''' (July 31, 1912 – November 16, 2006) was an American [[economist]], [[statistician]], and author who taught at the [[University of Chicago]] for more than three decades. He was a recipient of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], and is known for his research on [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] analysis, [[money supply|monetary]] history and theory, and the complexity of [[stabilization policy]]. <ref name=nobel1>{{cite web|title=Milton Friedman on nobelprize.org|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1976/|year=1976|publisher=Nobel Prize|accessdate=February 20, 2008}}</ref> As a leader of the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago school of economics]], he influenced the research agenda of the economics profession. A survey of economists ranked Friedman as the second most popular economist of the twentieth century behind [[John Maynard Keynes]],<ref>Davis, William L, Bob Figgins, David Hedengren, and Daniel B.

During the 1960s he promoted an alternative macroeconomic policy known as "[[monetarism]]". He theorized there existed a [[natural rate of unemployment|"natural" rate of unemployment]], and argued that governments could increase employment above this rate (e.g., by increasing [[aggregate demand]]) only at the risk of causing inflation to accelerate. <ref>Among macroeconomists, the "natural" rate has been increasingly replaced by [[James Tobin]]'s [[NAIRU]], the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, which is seen as having fewer normative connotations. </ref> He argued that the [[Phillips curve]] was not stable and predicted what would come to be known as [[stagflation]]. <ref>Nobel prize winner Paul Krugman stated that, "In 1968 in one of the decisive intellectual achievements of postwar economics, Friedman not only showed why the apparent tradeoff embodied in the idea of the Phillips curve was wrong; he also predicted the emergence of combined inflation and high unemployment...dubbed ‘stagflation.” Paul Krugman, [http://books.google.com/books?id=GcmvijkDrEcC&pg=PA43&lpg=PA43&dq=friedman+stagflation+krugman+decisive&source=bl&ots=S6Xzh9k7Ed&sig=fhh8I_YV3OWf8qlVl5n3QYxcU4E&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result ''Peddling Prosperity: Economic Sense and Nonsense in an Age of Diminished Expectations'' (1995) p 43 online]</ref>  Though opposed to the existence of the [[Federal Reserve]], Friedman argued that, given that it does exist, a steady, small expansion of the [[money supply]] was the only wise policy. <ref name=bestofbothworlds/>   . 

Friedman was an economic adviser to conservative President [[Ronald Reagan]]. His political philosophy extolled the virtues of a [[free market]] economic system with minimal intervention. He once stated that his role in eliminating [[Conscription in the United States|U.S. conscription]] was his proudest accomplishment, and his support for [[school choice]] led him to found [[The Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice]]. In his 1962 book ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'', Friedman advocated policies such as a [[volunteer military]], freely [[floating exchange rate]]s, abolition of medical licenses, a [[negative income tax]], and [[education voucher]]s. <ref>[http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Friedman.html Milton Friedman (1912–2006)]</ref> His ideas concerning [[monetary policy]], taxation, privatization and [[deregulation]] influenced government policies, especially during the 1980s.

{{TOC limit|2}} . 

==Early life==. 
Friedman was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]], to recent [[Jewish]] immigrants Jenő Friedman and Sára Landau from [[Beregszász]] in [[Austria-Hungary]] (now [[Berehove]] in [[Ukraine]]), both of whom worked as [[dry goods]] merchants. Shortly after Milton's birth, the family relocated to [[Rahway, New Jersey]]. A talented student, Friedman graduated from [[Rahway High School]] in 1928, just before his 16th birthday. <ref>Eamonn  Butler, ''Milton Friedman'' (2011) ch 1</ref><ref>Alan O.  Ebenstein, ''Milton Friedman: a biography'' (2007) pp 5-12</ref> . 

Friedman graduated from [[Rutgers University]] in [[New Jersey]], where he specialized in [[mathematics]] and initially intended to become an [[actuary]]. During his time at Rutgers, Friedman became influenced by two economics professors, [[Arthur F. Burns]] and [[Homer Jones (economist)|Homer Jones]], who convinced him that modern economics could help end the [[Great Depression]]. 
After graduating from Rutgers in 1932, Friedman was offered two scholarships to do graduate work; one being Mathematics at [[Brown University]] and the other being Economics at the University of Chicago. <ref>{{cite news|title=Milton Friedman and his start in economics|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhYOtG2pt3w&feature=related|date=August, 2006|publisher=Young America's Foundation|accessdate=march 12, 2012}}</ref>Friedman chose the latter, thus earning an [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] in 1933. He was strongly influenced by [[Jacob Viner]], [[Frank Knight]], and [[Henry Calvert Simons|Henry Simons]]. It was at Chicago that Friedman met his future wife, economist [[Rose Friedman|Rose Director]]. During 1933–34 he had a [[Fellow#Graduate school fellowships|fellowship]] at [[Columbia University]], where he studied [[statistics]] with renowned statistician and economist [[Harold Hotelling]]. He was back in Chicago for 1934–35, spending the year working as a [[research assistant]] for [[Henry Schultz]], who was then working on ''Theory and Measurement of Demand''. That year, Friedman formed what would prove to be lifelong friendships with [[George Stigler]] and [[W. Allen Wallis]]. <ref>Ebenstein, ''Milton Friedman: a biography'' (2007) pp 13-30</ref> . 

==Public service==. 
Friedman was initially unable to find academic employment, so during 1935, he followed his friend W. Allen Wallis to Washington, where [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] was "a lifesaver" for many young economists. <ref>{{cite web|title=Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman dies at 94|first=Mark|last=Feeney|date=November 16, 2006|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2006/11/nobel_lauriet_e.html|publisher=The Boston Globe|accessdate=February 20, 2008}}</ref>
At this stage, Friedman said that he and his wife "regarded the job-creation programs such as the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]], [[Civilian Conservation Corps|CCC]], and [[Public Works Administration|PWA]] appropriate responses to the critical situation," but not "the [[price-fixing|price-]] and wage-fixing measures of the [[National Recovery Administration]] and the [[Agricultural Adjustment Administration]]."<ref>{{harvnb|Friedman|1999|p=59}}</ref>
Foreshadowing his later ideas, he believed [[price controls]] interfered with an essential signaling mechanism to help resources be used where they were most valued. Indeed, Friedman later concluded that all government intervention associated with the New Deal was "the wrong cure for the wrong disease," arguing that the money supply should simply have been expanded, instead of contracted. <ref>{{cite web|title=Right from the Start? What Milton Friedman can teach progressives.|url=http://delong.typepad.com/pdf/20070308_108-115.delong.FINAL.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=J. Bradford DeLong|accessdate=February 20, 2008}}</ref>
In the publication ''[[Monetary History of the United States]]'' by Friedman and [[Anna J. Schwartz|Anna Schwartz]], they argue that the [[Great Depression]] was caused by [[Contractionary monetary policy|monetary contraction]], which was the consequence of poor policymaking by the [[Federal reserve]] and the continuous crises of the banking system. <ref>{{harvnb|Bernanke|2004|p=7}}</ref> . 

During 1935, he began work for the National Resources Committee, which was then working on a large consumer budget survey. Ideas from this project later became a part of his ''Theory of the Consumption Function''. Friedman began employment with the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] during autumn 1937 to assist [[Simon Kuznets]] in his work on professional income. This work resulted in their jointly authored publication ''Incomes from Independent Professional Practice'', which introduced the concepts of permanent and transitory income, a major component of the [[Permanent Income Hypothesis]] that Friedman worked out in greater detail in the 1950s. The book hypothesizes that professional licensing artificially restricts the supply of services and raises prices.  . 

During 1940, Friedman was appointed an assistant professor teaching Economics at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], but encountered [[antisemitism]] in the Economics department and decided to return to government service. <ref>{{harvnb|Friedman|1999|p=42}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Friedman|1999|pp=84–85}}</ref> Friedman spent 1941–43 working on wartime [[tax]] policy for the Federal Government, as an advisor to senior officials of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]]. As a Treasury spokesman during 1942 he advocated a [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] policy of [[taxation in the United States|taxation]], and during this time he helped to invent the payroll [[withholding tax]] system, since the federal government badly needed money in order to fight the [[Second World War]]. <ref>{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Schmidt|date=July 29, 2002|title=National Taxpayers Union|url=http://www.ntu.org/main/press.php?PressID=256&org_name=NTU|publisher=Nationals Taxpayers Union|accessdate=February 20, 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080410100639/http://www.ntu.org/main/press.php?PressID=256&org_name=NTU |archivedate = April 10, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> He later said in an interview, "I have no apologies for it, but I really wish we hadn't found it necessary and I wish there were some way of abolishing withholding now."<ref name="reason">{{cite web|first=Brian|last=Doherty|date=June 1995|title=Best of Both Worlds|url=http://reason.com/archives/1995/06/01/best-of-both-worlds|publisher=Reason|accessdate=July 28, 2010}}</ref> . 

==Academic career==. 
===Early years===. 
During 1943, Friedman joined the Division of War Research at [[Columbia University]] (headed by [[W. Allen Wallis]] and [[Harold Hotelling]]), where he spent the rest of the war years working as a mathematical statistician, focusing on problems of [[weapon]]s design, [[military tactics]], and [[metallurgical]] experiments. Then during 1945, Friedman submitted ''Incomes from Independent Professional Practice'' (co-authored with Kuznets and completed during 1940) to Columbia as his doctoral dissertation. The university awarded him a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] during 1946. Friedman spent the 1945–46 academic year teaching at the [[University of Minnesota]] (where his friend George Stigler was employed). On February 12, 1945, his son, [[David D. Friedman]] was born.  . 

===University of Chicago===. 
[[File:Harper Midway Chicago.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[University of Chicago]]]]
During 1946, Friedman accepted an offer to teach economic theory at the University of Chicago (a position opened by departure of his former professor [[Jacob Viner]] to Princeton University). Friedman would work for the University of Chicago for the next 30 years. There he helped build an intellectual community that produced a number of Nobel Prize winners, known collectively as the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School of Economics]].  . 

At that time, Arthur Burns, who was then the head of the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]], asked Friedman to rejoin the Bureau's staff. He accepted the invitation, and assumed responsibility for the Bureau's inquiry into the role of money in the [[business cycle]]. 
As a result, he initiated the "Workshop in Money and Banking" (the "Chicago Workshop"), which promoted a revival of monetary studies. During the latter half of the 1940s, Friedman began a collaboration with [[Anna Schwartz]], an [[Economic history|economic historian]] at the Bureau, that would ultimately result in the 1963 publication of a book co-authored by Friedman and Schwartz, ''[[A Monetary History of the United States|A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960]]''.  . 

Friedman spent the 1954–55 academic year as a Fulbright Visiting Fellow at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]]. At the time, the Cambridge economics faculty was divided into a [[Keynesian]] majority (including [[Joan Robinson]] and [[Richard Kahn, Baron Kahn|Richard Kahn]]) and an anti-Keynesian minority (headed by [[Dennis Robertson (economist)|Dennis Robertson]]). Friedman speculates that he was invited to the fellowship because his views were unacceptable to both of the Cambridge factions. Later his weekly columns for ''Newsweek'' magazine (1966–84) were well read and increasingly influential among political and business people. <ref>CATO, "Letter from Washington," ''National Review,'' September 19, 1980, Vol. 32 Issue 19, p 1119</ref> From 1968 to 1978, he and [[Paul Samuelson]] participated in the Economics Cassette Series, a biweekly subscription series where the economist would discuss the days' issues for about a half hour at a time. <ref>http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/slide-shows/79281</ref> . 

Friedman was an economic adviser to Republican presidential candidate [[Barry Goldwater]] during 1964.  . 

==Nobel memorial prize and retirement==. 
In 1976 Friedman won the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]] "for his achievements in the fields of consumption analysis, [[money supply|monetary]] history and theory and for his demonstration of the complexity of stabilization policy."<ref name=nobel1 /> During the banquet speech he made a reference to “the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel”. In that he was the first recipient to do so, and it wasn’t until 2006 that a recipient of the prize called it by its proper name. <ref>{ http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1976/friedman-speech.html }</ref>
During 1977, at age 65, Friedman retired from the University of Chicago after teaching there for 30&nbsp;years. He and his wife moved to San Francisco where he became a visiting scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. From 1977 on, he was affiliated with the [[Hoover Institution]] at [[Stanford University]]. During the same year, Friedman was approached by the [http://freetochoose.com/ Free To Choose Network] and asked to create a television program presenting his economic and social philosophy. 
The Friedmans worked on this project for the next three years, and during 1980, the ten-part series, titled ''[[Free to Choose]]'', was broadcast by the [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS). The companion book to the series (co-authored by Milton and his wife, [[Rose Friedman]]), also titled ''Free To Choose'', was the bestselling nonfiction book of 1980 and has since been translated into 14 foreign languages.  . 

Friedman served as an unofficial adviser to Ronald Reagan during his 1980 presidential campaign, and then served on the President's Economic Policy Advisory Board for the rest of the [[Reagan Administration]]. During 1988, he received the [[National Medal of Science]] and Reagan honored him with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]. 
Milton Friedman is known now as one of the most influential economists of the 20th century. <ref>{{cite news|title=Milton Friedman: An enduring legacy|url=http://www.economist.com/daily/news/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8190872|publisher=The Economist|date=November 17, 2006|accessdate=February 20, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Patricia|last=Sullivan|date=November 17, 2006|title=Economist Touted Laissez-Faire Policy|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/16/AR2006111600592.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=February 20, 2008}}</ref> Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Friedman continued to write [[op-ed|editorials]] and appear on television. He made several visits to [[Eastern Europe]] and to China, where he also advised governments.  . 

==Scholarly contributions==. 
{{See also|Friedman–Savage utility function|Friedman rule|Friedman's k-percent rule|Friedman test}} . 

===Economics===. 
Friedman was best known for reviving interest in the money supply as a determinant of the nominal value of output, that is, the [[quantity theory of money]]. [[Monetarism]] is the set of views associated with modern quantity theory. Its origins can be traced back to the 16th-century [[School of Salamanca#Money, value, and price|School of Salamanca]] or even further; however, Friedman's contribution is largely responsible for its modern popularization. He co-authored, with [[Anna Schwartz]], ''A Monetary History of the United States'' (1963), which was an examination of the role of the money supply and [[economy of the United States|economic activity]] in U.S. history. A striking conclusion of their research was one regarding the role of money supply fluctuations as contributing to economic fluctuations. Several regression studies with David Meiselman during the 1960s suggested the primacy of the money supply over investment and government spending in determining consumption and output. These challenged a prevailing but largely untested view on their relative importance. Friedman's empirical research and some theory supported the conclusion that the short-run effect of a change of the money supply was primarily on output but that the longer-run effect was primarily on the price level.  . 

Friedman was the main proponent of the [[monetarism|monetarist]] school of economics. He maintained that there is a close and stable association between [[inflation|price inflation]] and the money supply, mainly that price inflation should be regulated with monetary deflation and price deflation with [[monetary inflation]]. He famously quipped that [[deflation|price deflation]] can be fought by "dropping money out of a helicopter."<ref>{{cite book |title=Optimum Quantity of Money |publisher=Aldine Publishing Company |year=1969 |page=4}}</ref> . 

Friedman's arguments were designed to counter popular claims that price inflation at the time was the result of increases in the price of oil, or increases in wages: as he wrote, {{quote|[[Inflation]] is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.|Milton Friedman, 1963. <ref>Friedman, Milton. ''Inflation: Causes and Consequences''. New York: Asia Publishing House. </ref>}} . 

Friedman rejected the use of [[fiscal policy]] as a tool of [[demand]] management; and he held that the government's role in the guidance of the economy should be restricted severely. Friedman wrote extensively on the Great Depression, which he termed the [[Great Contraction]], arguing that it had been caused by an ordinary financial [[shock (economics)|shock]] whose duration and seriousness were greatly increased by the subsequent contraction of the money supply caused by the misguided policies of the directors of the Federal Reserve. 
{{quote|The Fed was largely responsible for converting what might have been a garden-variety recession, although perhaps a fairly severe one, into a major catastrophe. Instead of using its powers to offset the depression, it presided over a decline in the quantity of money by one-third from 1929 to 1933 ... Far from the depression being a failure of the free-enterprise system, it was a tragic failure of government.|Milton Friedman|Two Lucky People, 233}} . 

Friedman also argued for the cessation of government intervention in [[Foreign exchange market|currency markets]], thereby spawning an enormous literature on the subject, as well as promoting the practice of freely floating [[exchange rate]]s. His close friend [[George Stigler]] explained, "As is customary in science, he did not win a full victory, in part because research was directed along different lines by the [[Rational expectations|theory of rational expectations]], a newer approach developed by [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert Lucas]], also at the University of Chicago."<ref>{{cite book |title=Memoirs of an Unregulated Economist |first=Milton |last=Friedman |publisher=Aldine Publishing Company |year=1969 |page=4}}</ref> . 

Friedman was also known for his work on the consumption function, the [[permanent income hypothesis]] (1957), which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work. <ref>{{cite episode |title=Charlie Rose Show |airdate=December 26, 2005}}</ref>
This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income. Windfall gains would mostly be saved. Tax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to increase later to balance public finances. Other important contributions include his critique of the [[Phillips curve]] and the concept of the [[natural rate of unemployment]] (1968). This critique associated his name, together with that of [[Edmund Phelps]], with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so. Unemployment may be temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, but in the long run unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections of the labor market.  . 

Friedman's essay "[[Essays in Positive Economics#The Methodology of Positive Economics|The Methodology of Positive Economics]]" (1953) provided the [[epistemological]] pattern for his own subsequent research and to a degree that of the Chicago School. There he argued that economics as ''science'' should be free of value judgments for it to be objective. Moreover, a useful economic theory should be judged not by its descriptive realism but by its simplicity and fruitfulness as an engine of prediction.  That is, students should measure the accuracy of its predictions, rather than the "soundness of its assumptions. His argument was part of an ongoing debate among such statisticians as [[Jerzy Neyman]], [[Leonard Savage]], and [[Ronald Fisher]]. <ref>David Teira, "Milton Friedman, the Statistical Methodologist," ''History of Political Economy'' (2007) 39#3 pp 511-527,  </ref> . 

===Statistics===. 
One of his most famous contributions to [[statistics]] is sequential sampling. "Friedman did statistical work at the Division of War Research at Columbia. He and his colleagues came up with a sampling technique, known as [[sequential analysis|sequential sampling]], which became, in the words of ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 'the standard analysis of quality control inspection.' The dictionary adds: 'Like many of Friedman’s contributions, in retrospect it seems remarkably simple and obvious to apply basic economic ideas to quality control; that however is a measure of his genius.'"<ref name=ReasonOnFriedman>[http://www.reason.com/news/show/118494.html The Life and Times of Milton Friedman – Remembering the 20th century's most influential libertarian]</ref> . 

==Other work==. 
Friedman was an important member of the team during World War II that developed a new [[proximity fuse]] for anti-aircraft projectiles, which prevented shells from exploding unless they were near the object they are meant to destroy. <ref name=ReasonOnFriedman /> . 

==Public policy positions==. 
{{Libertarianism sidebar |width=22em}} . 

===Federal reserve===. 
Friedman believed that if the money supply was to be centrally controlled (as by the Federal Reserve) that the preferable way to do it would be with a mechanical system that would keep the quantity of money increasing at a steady rate. However, instead of government involvement at all, he was open to a "real," non-government, gold standard where money is produced by the private market: "A real gold standard is thoroughly consistent with [classical] liberal principles and I, for one, am entirely in favor of measures promoting its development." He did however add this caveat, "Let me emphasize that this note is not a plea for a return to a gold standard.... I regard a return to a gold standard as neither desirable nor feasible—with the one exception that it might become feasible if the doomsday predictions of hyperinflation under our present system should prove correct."<ref name="fff.org">Richard M. Ebeling.Monetary Central Planning and the State, Part 27: Milton Friedman's Second Thoughts on the Costs of Paper Money http://www.fff.org/freedom/0399b.asp</ref> He said the reason that it was not feasible was because "there is essentially no government in the world that is willing to surrender control over its domestic monetary policy." However, it could be done if "you could re-establish a world in which government's budget accounted for 10 percent of the national income, in which laissez-faire reigned, in which governments did not interfere with economic activities and in which full employment policies had been relegated to the dustbin..."<ref name="fff.org"/> . 

He was critical of the [[Federal Reserve]]'s influence on the economics profession. In a 1993 letter to [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] economics professor and former [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|House Banking Committee]] investigator Robert Auerbach, Friedman wrote: . 

<blockquote>
I cannot disagree with you that having something like 500 economists is extremely unhealthy. As you say, it is not conducive to independent, objective research. You and I know there has been censorship of the material published. Equally important, the location of the economists in the Federal Reserve has had a significant influence on the kind of research they do, biasing that research toward noncontroversial technical papers on method as opposed to substantive papers on policy and results. <ref>[[Ryan Grim|Grim, Ryan]] (September 7, 2009) [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/09/07/priceless-how-the-federal_n_278805.html Priceless: How The Federal Reserve Bought The Economics Profession], ''[[Huffington Post]]''</ref>

In his 1955 article "The Role of Government in Education" Friedman proposed supplementing publicly operated schools with privately run but publicly funded schools through a system of [[school voucher]]s. <ref>{{cite journal |jstor=795126 |title=Review: Education Vouchers |authors=Leonard Ross and Richard Zeckhauser |journal=The Yale Law Journal |volume=80 |issue=2 |month=December |year=1970 |pages=451–461}}</ref> Reforms similar to those proposed in the article were implemented in, for example, Chile in 1981 and Sweden in 1992. <ref>{{cite journal |jstor=1189163 |title=National Voucher Plans in Chile and Sweden: Did Privatization Reforms Make for Better Education? |author=Martin Carnoy |journal=Comparative Education Review |volume=42 |issue=3 |month=August |year=1998 |pages=309–337}}</ref> In 1996 Friedman, together with his wife, founded the [[The Foundation for Educational Choice]] to advocate [[school choice]] and vouchers.  . 

===Conscription===. 
Milton Friedman was a major proponent of a [[volunteer military]], stating that the [[Conscription|draft]] was "inconsistent with a free society."<ref>{{cite video | people = Milton Friedman | title = The War on Drugs | publisher = America's Drug Forum |date = 1991 | url = http://yes390.org/friedmanvideos.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Rostker |first= Bernard |title= I Want You!: The Evolution of the All-Volunteer Force |publisher= [[Rand Corporation]] |year= 2006 |isbn= 9780833038951 |page= 4 }}</ref>
In ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'', he argued that conscription is inequitable and arbitrary, preventing young men from shaping their lives as they see fit. <ref name=draft>{{cite book|title=Capitalism and Freedom|page=36|first=Milton|last=Friedman|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|date=November 15, 2002}}</ref> During the Nixon administration he headed the committee to research a conversion to paid/volunteer armed force. He would later state that his role in eliminating the [[conscription in the United States]] was his proudest accomplishment. <ref name =bestofbothworlds>{{Citation | last = Doherty | first = Brian | author-link = Brian Doherty (journalist) | title = Best of Both Worlds | newspaper = [[Reason (magazine)|Reason Magazine]] | date = June 1, 1995 | url = http://www.reason.com/news/show/29691.html | accessdate =October 24, 2009}}</ref> Friedman did, however, believe a nation could compel military ''training'' as a reserve in case of war time. <ref name=draft/> . 

===Libertarianism and the Republican party===. 
He served as a member of President Reagan's [[Economic Policy Advisory Board]] during 1981. During 1988, he received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] and the [[National Medal of Science]]. He said that he was a libertarian philosophically, but a member of the U.S. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] for the sake of "expediency" ("I am a libertarian with a small 'l' and a Republican with a capital 'R.' And I am a Republican with a capital 'R' on grounds of expediency, not on principle.") But, he said, "I think the term [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] is also equally applicable. I don't really care very much what I'm called. I'm much more interested in having people thinking about the ideas, rather than the person."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://queensjournal.ca/article.php?point=vol129/issue37/features/lead1 |title=''Friedman and Freedom''|publisher=Queen's Journal|accessdate=February 20, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060811115145/http://queensjournal.ca/article.php?point=vol129/issue37/features/lead1 |archivedate=August 11, 2006}}, Interview with Peter Jaworski. ''The Journal'', Queen's University, March 15, 2002 – Issue 37, Volume 129</ref> . 

===Public goods and monopoly===. 
Friedman was supportive of the state provision of some [[public good]]s that private businesses are not considered as being able to provide. However, he argued that many of the services performed by government could be performed better by the private sector. Above all, if some public goods are provided by the state, he believed that they should not be a [[legal monopoly]] where private competition is prohibited; for example, he wrote: . 

{{quote|There is no way to justify our present [[public monopoly]] of the [[United States Post Office|post office]]. It may be argued that the carrying of mail is a [[technical monopoly]] and that a [[government monopoly]] is the least of evils. Along these lines, one could perhaps justify a government post office, but not the present law, which makes it illegal for anybody else to carry the mail. If the delivery of mail is a technical monopoly, no one else will be able to succeed in competition with the government. If it is not, there is no reason why the government should be engaged in it. The only way to find out is to leave other people free to enter.|Milton Friedman|Friedman, Milton & Rose D. ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'', University of Chicago Press, 1982, 29}} . 

===Welfare===. 
Friedman made newspaper headlines by proposing a [[negative income tax]] to replace the existing [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] system, and then opposing a bill to implement it because the bill proposed to supplement the existing system rather than replace it.  . 

===Drugs===. 
Friedman also supported [[libertarianism|libertarian]] policies such as legalization of [[recreational drug|drugs]] and [[prostitution]]. During 2005, Friedman and more than 500 other economists advocated discussions regarding the economic benefits of the [[legal issues of cannabis|legalization of marijuana]]. <ref>{{cite web|title=An open letter|url=http://www.prohibitioncosts.org/endorsers.html|publisher=Prohibition Costs|accessdate=February 20, 2008}}</ref> . 

===Economic freedom===. 
[[Michael Walker (economist)|Michael Walker]] of the [[Fraser Institute]] and Friedman hosted a series of conferences from 1986 to 1994. The goal was to create a clear definition of [[economic freedom]] and a method for measuring it. Eventually this resulted in the first report on worldwide economic freedom, ''Economic Freedom in the World''. This annual report has since provided data for numerous peer-reviewed studies and has influenced policy in several nations.  . 

Along with sixteen other distinguished economists he opposed the [[Copyright Term Extension Act]] and filed an [[amicus brief]] in ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]''. <ref>{{cite web|title=In the Supreme Court of the United States|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/openlaw/eldredvashcroft/supct/amici/economists.pdf|publisher=Harvard Law School|accessdate=February 20, 2008}}</ref> He supported the inclusion of the word "[[wikt:no-brainer|no-brainer]]" in the brief. <ref>{{cite web|last=Lessig |first=Lawrence |url=http://lessig.org/blog/2006/11/only_if_the_word_nobrainer_app.html |title="only if the word 'no-brainer' appears in it somewhere": RIP Milton Friedman (Lessig Blog) |publisher=Lessig.org |date=November 19, 2006 |accessdate=July 29, 2010}}</ref> . 

Friedman argued for stronger basic legal (constitutional) protection of economic rights and freedoms in order to further promote industrial-commercial growth and prosperity and buttress democracy and freedom and the rule of law generally in society. <ref>[http://industry.books.officelive.com/billrights.aspx ''A New British Bill of Rights: The Case For'', ISR Online Guide]</ref> . 

==Honors, recognition, and influence==. 
Friedman allowed the [[Cato Institute#Milton Friedman Prize|Cato Institute]] to use his name for its biannual Milton Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty beginning in 2001. A Friedman Prize was given to the late British economist [[Peter Bauer]] during 2002, Peruvian economist [[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando de Soto]] during 2004, [[Mart Laar]], former Estonian Prime Minister during 2006 and a young Venezuelan student [[Yon Goicoechea]] during 2008. His wife Rose, sister of [[Aaron Director]], with whom he initiated [[the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice]], served on the international selection committee. Friedman was also a recipient of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economics]].  . 

===Hong Kong===. 
Friedman once said, "If you want to see capitalism in action, go to Hong Kong."<ref>{{cite web|first=Waldemar|last=Ingdahl|date=March 22, 2007|title=Real Virtuality|url=http://www.american.com/archive/2007/march-0307/real-virtuality/|publisher=The American|accessdate=February 20, 2008}}</ref> He wrote in 1990 that the [[economy of Hong Kong|Hong Kong economy]] was perhaps the best example of a free market economy. <ref>{{cite book | last = Friedman | first = Milton | last2 = Friedman | first2 = Rose | title = Free to Choose: A Personal Statement | page = 34 | publisher = Harvest Books | year = 1990 | isbn = 0156334607}}</ref> . 

One month before his death, he wrote the article "Hong Kong Wrong – What would [[John James Cowperthwaite|Cowperthwaite]] say?" in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', criticizing [[Donald Tsang]], the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, for abandoning "positive noninterventionism."<ref name=wsj_20061006>{{cite web|author=Friedman, Milton|date=October 6, 2006|title=Dr. Milton Friedman|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110009051|publisher=Opinion Journal|accessdate=February 20, 2008}}</ref>
Tsang later said he was merely changing the slogan to "big market, small government," where small government is defined as less than 20% of GDP. In a debate between Tsang and his rival, [[Alan Leong]], before the [[Hong Kong Chief Executive election, 2007|2007 Chief Executive election]], Leong introduced the topic and jokingly accused Tsang of angering Friedman to death.  . 

===Chile===. 
{{Main|Miracle of Chile|Chicago Boys}}
During 1975, two years after the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|military coup]] that ended the government of [[Salvador Allende]], the economy of [[Chile]] experienced a crisis. Friedman accepted the invitation of a private foundation to visit Chile and speak on principles of [[economic freedom]]. He spent seven days in Chile giving a series of lectures. One of the lectures was entitled "The Fragility of Freedom," and according to Friedman, "dealt with precisely the threat to freedom from a centralized military government."<ref name=icelandtv>{{cite video

 }}</ref> Friedman encapsulated his philosophy in a lecture at Universidad Católica de Chile, saying: "free markets would undermine political centralization and political control."<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Jeffery Sachs on the "Miracle of Chile"|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/ufd_reformliberty_full.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=February 20, 2008}}</ref> . 

Friedman also met with [[military dictator]] President [[Augusto Pinochet]] during his visit. He never served as an adviser to the Chilean government, but did write a letter to Pinochet outlining what Friedman considered the two key economic problems of Chile. The letter listed a series of [[Monetary policy|monetary]] and [[Fiscal policy|fiscal]] measures deemed a "shock program" to end [[hyperinflation]] and promote a [[market economy]]. <ref name=letter>[http://wwww.naomiklein.org/files/resources/pdfs/friedman-pinochet-letters.pdf Letters of correspondence between Friedman and dictator Pinochet]</ref> His letter suggested (among other, more specific prescriptions) that a brief period of cutting government spending would reduce its fiscal deficit and thus reduce the rate of increase of the quantity of money in the country that was driving inflation. The economist did however admit his knowledge of Chile was "too limited to enable [him] to be precise or comprehensive" and that the measures he outlined were "to be taken as illustrative."<ref name=letter/> Friedman felt that there might be a brief period ("measured in months") of higher unemployment, followed by recovery once inflation was tamed. His letter also suggested that cutting spending to reduce the fiscal deficit would result in less transitional unemployment than raising taxes to do so. Later, Friedman said he believed that market reforms would undermine Pinochet. <ref>{{cite web|title=Commanding Heights: Milton Friedman|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitext/int_miltonfriedman.html#10|publisher=PBS|accessdate=December 29, 2008}}</ref>
Chilean graduates of the [[Chicago School of Economics]] and its new local chapters had been appointed to important positions in the new government soon after the [[coup]], which allowed them to advise Pinochet on economic policies in accord with the School's economic doctrine.  . 

According to his critics, Friedman did not criticize Pinochet's dictatorship at the time, nor the assassinations, illegal imprisonments, torture, or other atrocities that were well known by then. <ref>{{cite news|title=General Augusto Pinochet|author=O'Shaughnessy, Hugh|date=December 11, 2006|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/general-augusto-pinochet-427998.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=February 20, 2008}}</ref> In his 1980 documentary ''[[Free to Choose]]'', he said the following: "Chile is not a politically free system, and I do not condone the system. But the people there are freer than the people in Communist societies because government plays a smaller role. ... The conditions of the people in the past few years has been getting better and not worse. They would be still better to get rid of the junta and to be able to have a free democratic system."<ref>{{cite web|title=Free to Choose Vol. 5|url=http://www.freetochoose.net/1980_vol5_transcript.html|publisher=Free to Choose|accessdate=February 20, 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080209233014/http://www.freetochoose.net/1980_vol5_transcript.html |archivedate = February 9, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQkdSj6arn0 Frances Fox Piven vs. Milton Friedman, Thomas Sowell], debate, 1980, [[YouTube]]. </ref> In 1984 Friedman proclaimed he has "never refrained from criticizing the political system in Chile."<ref name=icelandtv/> . 

Friedman defended his activity in Chile on the grounds that, in his opinion, the adoption of free market policies not only improved the economic situation of Chile but also contributed to the amelioration of [[Chile under Pinochet|Pinochet's rule]] and to the eventual [[Chilean transition to democracy|transition to a democratic government]] during 1990. That idea is included in ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'', in which he declared that economic freedom is not only desirable in itself but is also a necessary condition for [[political freedom]]. He stressed that the lectures he gave in Chile were the same lectures he later gave in China and other [[Socialism|socialist]] states. <ref>[[#refFriedman1999|Friedman 1999, pp. 600–601]]</ref> During the 2000 PBS documentary ''The Commanding Heights'' (based on [[The Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy|the book]]), Friedman continued to argue that criticism over his role in Chile missed his main contention that freer markets resulted in freer people, and that Chile's unfree economy had caused the military government. Friedman suggested that the economic liberalization he advocated caused the end of military rule and a free Chile. <ref name=pbs1>{{cite web|title=Milton Friedman interview|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/int_miltonfriedman.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=February 20, 2008}}</ref> . 

===Iceland===. 
Friedman visited [[Iceland]] during the [[autumn]] of 1984, met with important Icelanders and gave a lecture at the University of Iceland on the "tyranny of the ''[[status quo]]''." He participated in [http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=EBBF6DB20C85145A a lively television debate] on August 31, 1984 with socialist intellectuals, including [[Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson]], who later became the president of Iceland. <ref>{{cite video|title=Milton Friedman on Icelandic State Television in 1984|people=Friedman, Milton; Grímsson, Ólafur Ragnar}}</ref> When they complained that a fee was charged for attending his lecture at the University and that hitherto, lectures by visiting scholars had been free-of-charge, Friedman replied that previous lectures had not been free-of-charge in a meaningful sense: Lectures always have related costs. What mattered was whether attendees or non-attendees covered those costs. Friedman thought that it was fairer that only those who attended paid. In this discussion Friedman also stated that he did not receive any money for delivering that lecture.  . 

===Estonia===. 
Although Friedman never visited [[Estonia]], his book ''[[Free to Choose]]'' exercised a great influence on that nation's then 32-year-old prime minister, [[Mart Laar]], who has claimed that it was the only book on economics he had read before taking office. Laar's reforms are often credited with responsibility for transforming Estonia from an impoverished Soviet Republic to the "[[Baltic Tiger]]." A prime element of Laar's program was introduction of the [[flat tax]]. Laar won the 2006 Milton Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty, awarded by the [[Cato Institute]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/special/friedman/laar/|title=Mart Laar|publisher=Cato Institute|accessdate=February 20, 2008}}</ref> . 

===United Kingdom===. 
Milton Friedman influenced the thinking of Alan Walters and Patrick Minford, two of Margaret Thatcher's main macroeconomic advisers. See the book ''Margaret Thatcher's Revolution: How it Happened and What it Meant'', edited by Subroto Roy & John Clarke, Continuum 2005 . 

==Criticism==. 
===Keynesian criticism===. 
During the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]], several Keynesian economists such as [[James K. Galbraith|James Galbraith]] and [[Joseph Stiglitz]] blamed the free market philosophy of Friedman and the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago school]] for the economic turmoil. <ref>John Lippert, [http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?sid=a3GVhIHGyWRM&pid=20601109 Friedman Would Be Roiled as Chicago Disciples Rue Repudiation], [[Bloomberg L.P.]], December 23, 2009. Retrieved September 9, 2009. </ref> . 

After Friedman's death in 2006, [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel laureate]] [[Paul Krugman]], praised Friedman as a "great economist and a great man," but criticized him by writing that "he slipped all too easily into claiming both that markets always work and that only markets work. It's extremely hard to find cases in which Friedman acknowledged the possibility that markets could go wrong, or that government intervention could serve a useful purpose."<ref name=Krugman-NYRB>The New York Review of Books, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19857 Who Was Milton Friedman?], February 15, 2007</ref> . 

===Austrian school criticism===. 
In 1971, libertarian economist [[Murray Rothbard]] criticized Friedman's efforts to make the government more efficient as detrimental to individual liberty, concluding "...as we examine Milton Friedman’s credentials to be the leader of free-market economics, we arrive at the chilling conclusion that it is difficult to consider him a free-market economist at all."<ref>Murray Rothbard, [http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard43.html "Milton Friedman Unraveled"]. Originally printed 1971 in ''The Individualist''. Reprinted in the Journal of Libertarian Studies, Fall 2002. </ref> Friedman's position on governmental control of money changed since 1971 when this criticism was made. <ref>Ebeling, Richard. M., [http://www.fff.org/freedom/0399b.asp "Monetary Central Planning and the State, Part 27: Milton Friedman's Second Thoughts on the Costs of Paper Money"]</ref> In a 1995 interview in ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine he said the "difference between me and people like Murray Rothbard is that, though I want to know what my ideal is, I think I also have to be willing to discuss changes that are less than ideal so long as they point me in that direction." He said he actually would "like to abolish the Fed," and points out that when he has written about the Fed it is simply his recommendations of how it should be run given that it exists. <ref name=bestofbothworlds/> . 

===Other criticism===. 
In her book ''[[The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism]]'', journalist and author [[Naomi Klein]] criticized Friedman's ideology and the principles that guided the economic restructuring that followed the military coups in countries such as [[Chile]] and [[Indonesia]], drawing analogies between the way that Friedman proposed using the social "shock" of the coups to create an economic "blank slate" with [[Donald Ewen Cameron|Ewen Cameron]]'s controversial medical experiments that used electroshock therapy to create a mental "blank slate" in patients with mental disorders. <ref>Naomi Klein, ''The Shock Doctrine,'' Metropolitan Books, New York, NY 2007. </ref> Based on the extent to which the application of [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] policies has contributed to income disparities and inequality,<ref>Goldberg, P.K. and Pavcnik, N. (2007) [http://www.jstor.org/stable/27646747 "Distributional Effects of Globalization in Developing Countries"] Journal of Economic Literature, American Economic Association 45(1): 39–82</ref> both Klein and [[Noam Chomsky]] have suggested that the primary role of neoliberalism was as an ideological cover for capital accumulation by [[multinational corporation]]s. <ref>Noam Chomsky (1999) ''Profit Over People: Neoliberalism and Global Order,'' Seven Stories Press, New York, NY. </ref> Chilean economist [[Orlando Letelier]] asserted that Pinochet's dictatorship resorted to oppression because of popular opposition to Chicago School policies in Chile. <ref>Orlando Letelier, [http://www.tni.org/detail_page.phtml?page=letelier-docs_thenation Economic Freedom's Awful Toll], ''[[The Nation]]'', August 28, 1976. </ref> . 

==Personal life==. 
According to a 2007 article in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' magazine, his "parents were moderately observant [Jews], but Friedman, after an intense burst of childhood piety, rejected religion altogether."<ref>Lanny Ebenstein, [https://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/milton-friedman-by-lanny-ebenstein-10876?page=all Milton Friedman], ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', May 2007, p. 286. </ref> He described himself as an [[agnostic]]. <ref>{{cite news|last=Asman|first=David|title='Your World' Interview With Economist Milton Friedman|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,230045,00.html|accessdate=August 2, 2011|newspaper=Fox News|date=November 16, 2006}}</ref> . 

Friedman wrote extensively of his life and experiences, especially in 1998 in his memoirs with his wife [[Rose Friedman|Rose]], titled ''Two Lucky People''. He died of heart failure at the age of 94 years in San Francisco on November 16, 2006. <ref name=reuters_20061116>{{cite web|first=Jim|last=Christie|date=November 16, 2006|title=Free market economist Milton Friedman dead at 94|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUSWBT00621920061116|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=February 20, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Milton Friedman’s legacy|url=http://www.examiner.com/a-413909~Jay_Ambrose__Milton_Friedman_s_legacy.html|last=Ambrose|first=Jay|date=November 22, 2006|publisher=Examiner.com|accessdate=February 20, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
He was survived by his wife (who died on August 18, 2009) and their two children, [[David D. Friedman|David]], who is a philosopher and [[anarcho-capitalist]] economist, and Janet.
