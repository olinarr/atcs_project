'''Education in the United States''' is mainly provided by the [[public sector]], with control and funding coming from three levels: [[Federal government of the United States|federal]], [[state government|state]], and [[local government|local]]. Child education is [[compulsory education|compulsory]].  . 

[[Public education]] is universally available. School curricula, funding, teaching, employment, and other policies are set through locally elected [[school board]]s with jurisdiction over [[school district]]s with many directives from state legislatures. School districts are usually separate from other local jurisdictions, with independent officials and budgets.  Educational standards and [[standardized testing]] decisions are usually made by state governments.  . 

The ages for compulsory education vary by state. It begins from ages five to eight and ends from ages fourteen to eighteen. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0112617.html |title=State Compulsory School Attendance Laws |publisher=infoplease.com |accessdate=December 19, 2007}}</ref> . 

Compulsory education requirements can generally be satisfied by educating children in [[public school (government funded)|public schools]], state-certified [[private school]]s, or an approved [[homeschooling|home school]] program. In most public and private schools, education is divided into three levels: [[Primary education in the United States|elementary school]], [[middle school]] (sometimes called junior high school), and [[Secondary education in the United States|high school]] (sometimes referred to as secondary education).  In almost all schools at these levels, children are divided by age groups into [[grade levels|grades]], ranging from [[kindergarten]] (followed by [[first grade]]) for the youngest children in elementary school, up to [[twelfth grade]], the final year of [[high school]]. The exact age range of students in these grade levels varies slightly from area to area.  . 

[[Tertiary education|Post-secondary education]], better known as "[[college]]" in the United States, is generally governed separately from the elementary and high school system, and is described in a separate section below.  .

==Statistics==. 
In the year 2000, there were 76.6 million students enrolled in schools from [[kindergarten]] through [[graduate school]]s.  Of these, 72 percent aged 12 to 17 were judged academically "on track" for their age (enrolled in school at or above grade level).  Of those enrolled in compulsory education, 5.2 million (10.4 percent) were attending private schools.  . 

Among the country's adult population, over 85 percent have completed high school and 27 percent have received a [[bachelor's degree]] or higher.  The average salary for [[college]] or [[university]] graduates is greater than $51,000, exceeding the national average of those without a high school diploma by more than $23,000, according to a 2005 study by the U.S. Census Bureau. <ref name=census>[http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/education/004214.html United States Census (2000)] Retrieved June 17, 2005</ref>

''[[Science Daily]]''. </ref> . 

==School grades==. 
Most children enter the public education system around ages five or six.  The American school year traditionally begins at the end of August or the day after Labor Day in September, after the traditional summer recess.  Children are assigned into year groups known as grades, beginning with [[preschool]], followed by [[kindergarten]] and culminating in [[twelfth grade]].  Children customarily advance together from one grade to the next as a single cohort or "class" upon reaching the end of each school year in late May or early June.  . 

The American educational system comprises 12 grades of study over 12 calendar years of primary and secondary education before graduating and becoming eligible for college admission. <ref name="indobase.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.indobase.com/study-abroad/countries/usa/usa-education-system.html |title=American Education System – Education System in United States of America – USA Education System |publisher=Indobase.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref> After pre-kindergarten and [[kindergarten]], there are five years in <ref name="indobase.com"/> primary school (normally known as elementary school). After completing five grades, the student will enter junior high or middle school and then high school to get the high school diploma. <ref name="indobase.com"/> . 

The U.S. uses [[Ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal number]]s (e.g., [[first grade]]) for naming grades rather than the [[English numerals#Cardinal numbers|cardinal number]]s (e.g., grade one) frequently used in Canada and Australia. Typical ages and grade groupings in public and private schools may be found through the U.S. Department of Education. <ref>[http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/edlite-struc-geninfo.html Structure of U.S. Education].

Students completing high school may choose to attend a college or university. [[Undergraduate education|Undergraduate]] degrees may be either [[associate's degree]]s or [[bachelor's degree]]s (baccalaureate)  . 

[[Community colleges in the United States|Community college]] typically offer two-year associate's degrees, although some community colleges offer a limited number of bachelor's degrees. Some community college students chose to [[Transfer student|transfer]] to a four-year institution to pursue a bachelor's degree. Community colleges are generally publicly-funded and offer career certifications and part-time programs.  . 

Four-year institutions may be [[Public university|public]] or [[Private university|private]] colleges or universities.  . 

Most public institutions are [[State university|state universities]], which are sponsored by [[State government in the United States|state governments]] and typically receive funding through some combination of taxpayer funds, tuition, private donations, [[federal grant]]s, and proceeds from endowments. State universities are organized in a wide variety of ways, and many are part of a [[state university system]]. However, not all public institutions are state universities. The five [[United States Service academies|service academies]], one for each branch of the [[United States armed forces|armed forces]], are completely funded by the [[federal government]]; the academies train students (cadets or midshipmen) to be [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officers]] in exchange for a mandatory term of military service. Additionally, some [[Local governments in the United States|local governments]] (counties and cities) have four-year institutions of their own - one example is the [[City University of New York]].  . 

Private institutions are privately funded and there is wide variety in size, focus, and operation.  Some private institutions are large research universities, while others are small [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]] that concentrate on undergraduate education. Some private universities are [[nonsectarian]] while others are religiously-affiliated. While most private institutions are non-profit, a number a [[For-profit education|for profit]].  . 

Curriculum varies widely depending on the institution. Typically, an undergraduate student will be able to select an [[Academic major|academic major or concentration]], which comprises the main or special subjects, and students may change their major one or more times.  . 

Some students, typically those with a bachelor's degree, may chose to continue on to [[Graduate school|graduate]] or [[professional school]]. Graduate degrees may be either [[master's degree]]s (e.g., [[Master of Science|M.S.]], [[Master of Business Administration|M.B.A.]], [[Master of Social Work|M.S.W.]]) or [[doctorate]]s (e.g., [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]], [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]]). [[Academia]]-focused graduate school typically includes some combination of coursework and research (often requiring a [[thesis]] or [[dissertation]]), while professional school (e.g., [[Medical school|medical]], [[Law school in the United States|law]], [[Business school|business]]) grants a [[first professional degree]] and aims to prepare students to enter a learned profession.  . 

==Preschool==. 
In large cities, sometimes there are private preschools catering to the children of the wealthy.  Because some wealthy families see these schools as the first step toward the [[Ivy League]], there are even counselors who specialize in assisting parents and their toddlers through the preschool admissions process. <ref>[http://privateschool.about.com/od/educationalconsultants/ Educational Consultants].

==Student health==. 
According to the [[School nursing#United States|National Association of School Nurses]], 17% of students are considered obese and 32% are overweight. <ref name="scm0903">{{cite news | first= | last= | title=School Nurses | url=| work= | publisher=Space Coast Medicine and Healthy Living | location=Merritt Island, Florida | pages= 21–33 | date=March/April 2009 | id= | accessdate=}}</ref> . 

==Elementary and secondary education==. 
Schooling is compulsory for all children in the United States, but the age range for which school attendance is required varies from state to state.  Most children begin elementary education with [[kindergarten]] (usually five to six years old) and finish secondary education with [[twelfth grade]] (usually eighteen years old). In some cases, pupils may be promoted beyond the next regular grade.  Some states allow students to leave school between 14–17 with parental permission, before finishing high school; other states require students to stay in school until age 18<ref>[http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d08/tables/dt08_165.asp Age range for compulsory school attendance and special education services, and policies on year-round schools and kindergarten programs].

In 1971, the [[Swann v.

United Press International. </ref> This ruling resulted in a [[white flight]] from the inner cities which largely diluted the intent of the order. This flight had other, non-educational ramifications as well. Integration took place in most schools though [[de facto]] segregation often determined the composition of the student body.

In 2010, there were 3,823,142 teachers in public, charter, private, and Catholic elementary and secondary schools. They taught a total of 55,203,000 students, who attended one of 132,656 schools. <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.edreform.com/Fast_Facts/K12_Facts/ |title=K-12 Facts |accessdate= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2011-02-26 |year= |month= |work= Center for Education Reform|publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref><!--public school = 3,178,142, charter school = 42,100, private school = 456,270, Catholic schools = 146,630.

States do not require proper reporting from their school districts to allow analysis of efficiency of [[return on investment]]. The [[Center for American Progress]], called a "left-leaning think tank", commends Florida and Texas as the only two states that provides annual school-level productivity evaluations which report to the public how well school funds are being spent at the local level. This allows for comparison of school districts within a state. <ref>[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/01/pdf/dwwroi.pdf americanprogress.org]</ref><ref>The other is Texas</ref> . 

In 2010, American students rank 17th in the world. The [[Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development]] says that this is due to focusing on the low end of performers. All of the recent gains have been made, deliberately, at the low end of the socioeconomic scale and among the lowest achievers. The country has been outrun, the study says, by other nations because the US has not done enough to encourage the highest achievers. <ref>{{Cite news | first=Matt | last=Reed | title=Tackling 'achievement gap' hurts US schools | url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20101212/COLUMNISTS0207/12120317/1086/Matt%20Reed%20%20Chair%20of%20schools%20talks%20issues/MATT-REED--Cocoa-s--A--is-great--but-data-demand-a-breakthrough-by-elite.| work= | publisher=Florida Today | location=Melbourne, Florida | pages= 1B | date=12 December 2010 | id= | accessdate=}}</ref> .

Transporting students to and from school is a major concern for most school districts. School buses provide the largest mass transit program in the country; 8.8 billion trips per year. Non-school transit buses give 5.2 billion trips annually. 440,000 yellow school buses carry over 24 million students to and from school. <ref>[http://district.fms.k12.nm.us/departments/transportation district.fms.k12.nm.us]</ref> . 

School start times are computed with busing in mind. There are often three start times; for elementary, for middle/junior high, and for high school. One school district computed its cost per bus (without the driver) at $20,575 annually. It assumed a model where the average driver drove 80 miles per day. A driver was presumed to cost $.62 per mile (1.6&nbsp;km). Elementary schools started at 7:30, middle schools/junior high school started at 8:15 and senior high schools at 9:00. While elementary school started earlier, they also get out earlier, at 2:25; middle schools at 3:10 and senior high schools at 3:55. <ref>[http://www.gcsnc.com/boe/2011/1_22retreat/Multi%20Tier%20Presentation%20Jan%202011_AWL%20Revision%204.pdf gcsnc.com]</ref> All school districts establish their own times and means of transportation within guidelines set forth by their own state.  . 

===Elementary school===. 
{{refimprove section|date=March 2011}}
{{Main|Primary education in the United States}}
Historically, in the United States, local public control (and private alternatives) have allowed for some variation in the organization of schools. [[Elementary school]] includes kindergarten through [[fifth grade]] (or sometimes, to [[fourth grade]], [[sixth grade]] or [[eighth grade]]).  In elementary school, basic subjects are taught, and students often remain in one or two classrooms throughout the school day, with the exceptions of [[physical education]] ("P.E." or "gym"), [[library]], [[music]], and [[art]] classes. There are (as of 2001) about 3.6 million children in each grade in the United States. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/2002130.pdf |title=Digest of Education Statistics, 2001 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref> . 

Typically, the curriculum in public elementary education is determined by individual [[school districts]].  The school district selects curriculum guides and textbooks that are reflective of a state's learning standards and benchmarks for a given grade level. <ref name="isbe.state.il.us">{{cite web|url=http://www.isbe.state.il.us/ils/ |title=Illinois State Board of Education – Illinois Learning Standards |publisher=Isbe.state.il.us |date= |accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref>  Learning Standards are the goals by which states and school districts must meet adequate yearly progress (AYP) as mandated by [[No Child Left Behind]] (NCLB). This description of school governance is simplistic at best, however, and school systems vary widely not only in the way curricular decisions are made but also in how teaching and learning take place. Some states and/or school districts impose more top-down mandates than others. In others, teachers play a significant role in curriculum design and there are few top-down mandates. Curricular decisions within private schools are made differently than they are in public schools, and in most cases without consideration of NCLB.  . 

Public Elementary School teachers typically instruct between twenty and thirty students of diverse learning needs.  A typical classroom will include children with a range of learning needs or abilities, from those identified as having special needs of the kinds listed in the Individuals with Disabilities Act [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|IDEA]] to those that are cognitively, athletically or artistically gifted. At times, an individual school district identifies areas of need within the curriculum.  Teachers and advisory administrators form committees to develop supplemental materials to support learning for diverse learners and to identify enrichment for textbooks. Many school districts post information about the curriculum and supplemental materials on websites for public access. <ref>[http://www.d303.org/learnteach/curriculum.htm]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref> . 

In general, a student learns basic [[arithmetic]] and sometimes rudimentary algebra in [[mathematics]], English proficiency (such as basic [[English grammar|grammar]], [[English spelling|spelling]], and [[vocabulary]]), and fundamentals of other subjects. Learning standards are identified for all areas of a curriculum by individual States, including those for mathematics, social studies, science, physical development, the fine arts, and reading. <ref name="isbe.state.il.us"/> While the concept of State Learning standards has been around for some time, [[No Child Left Behind]] has mandated that standards exist at the State level.  . 

Elementary School teachers are trained with emphases on human cognitive and psychological development and the principles of curriculum development and instruction. Teachers typically earn either a Bachelors or Masters Degree in Early Childhood and Elementary Education. The teaching of [[social studies]] and [[science]] are often underdeveloped in elementary school programs. Some attribute this to the fact that elementary school teachers are trained as generalists; however, teachers attribute this to the priority placed on developing reading, writing and math proficiency in the elementary grades and to the large amount of time needed to do so. Reading, writing and math proficiency greatly affect performance in social studies, science and other content areas. Certification standards for teachers are determined by individual states, with individual colleges and universities determining the rigor of the college education provided for future teachers. Some states require content area tests, as well as instructional skills tests for teacher certification in that state. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isbe.state.il.us/certification/html/testing.htm |title=Illinois Certification Testing System (ICTS) |publisher=Isbe.state.il.us |date= |accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref> . 

The broad topic of Social Studies may include key events, documents, understandings, and concepts in American [[history of the United States|history]], and [[geography of the United States|geography]], and in some programs, state or local history and geography. Topics included under the broader term "science" vary from the physical sciences such as physics and chemistry, through the biological sciences such as biology, ecology, and physiology. 
Most States have predetermined the number of minutes that will be taught within a given content area.  Because [[No Child Left Behind]] focuses on reading and math as primary targets for improvement, other instructional areas have received less attention. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/nclb/overview/importance/nclbworking.html |title=Archived: No Child Left Behind Act Is Working |publisher=Ed.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref> There is much discussion within educational circles about the justification and impact of having curricula that place greater emphasis on those topics (reading, writing and math) that are specifically tested for improvement. <ref>[http://mailman.ncss.org/pipermail/trse-l/2006-August/001096.html]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref> . 

===Secondary education===. 
{{Main|Secondary education in the United States}}
As part of education in the United States, secondary education usually covers grades 6 through 9 or 10 through 12.  . 

====Junior and senior high school====. 
{{refimprove section|date=March 2011}}
[[Middle school]] and Junior high school include the grade levels intermediate between elementary school and senior high school. "Middle school" usually includes sixth, seventh and eighth grade; "Junior high" typically includes seventh through ninth grade.  The range defined by either is often based on demographic factors, such as an increase or decrease in the relative numbers of younger or older students, with the aim of maintaining stable school populations. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861692773/junior_high.html |publisher=encarta.msn.com |title=The major difference between a middle school and a junior high lies in the philosophy.  The middle school philosophy focuses on the student where the junior high focus is more on the content. Definition of junior high school |accessdate= July 24, 2007}} [http://www.webcitation.org/5kwbboMep archived webcitation.org], 2009-10-31. </ref> At this time, students are given more independence, moving to different classrooms for different subjects, and being allowed to choose some of their class subjects (electives). Usually, starting in ninth grade, grades become part of a student’s official transcript.  . 

[[Secondary education in the United States|Senior high school]] is a school attended after junior high school.  High school is often used instead of senior high school and distinguished from junior high school. High school usually runs either from 9th through 12th, or 10th through 12th grade. The students in these grades are commonly referred to as freshmen (grade 9), sophomores (grade 10), juniors (grade 11) and seniors (grade 12).  . 

=====Basic curricular structure=====. 
Generally, at the [[high school]] level, students take a broad variety of classes without special emphasis in any particular subject. Students are required to take a certain minimum number of mandatory subjects, but may choose additional subjects ("electives") to fill out their required hours of learning.  . 

The following minimum courses of study in mandatory subjects are required in nearly all U.S. high schools:
*Science (usually three years minimum, normally biology, chemistry and physics)
*Mathematics (usually four years minimum, normally including algebra, geometry, pre-calculus, statistics, and even calculus)
*English (usually four years minimum, including literature, humanities, composition, oral languages, etc.)
*Social sciences (usually three years minimum, including various history, government/economics courses)<ref name="test">{{cite web |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2008/3/2008_3_14.shtml |first=David |last=McCullough |title=History and Knowing Who We Are |publisher=''American Heritage'' |date=Winter 2008 }}</ref>
*Physical education (at least two years) . 

Many states require a "health" course in which students learn about [[anatomy]], [[nutrition]], [[first aid]], [[human sexuality|sexuality]], [[drug awareness]] and [[birth control]].  Anti-drug use programs are also usually part of health courses.  In many cases, however, options are provided for students to "test out" of this requirement or complete independent study to meet it. Foreign language and some form of art education are also a mandatory part of the curriculum in some schools.  . 

=====Electives=====. 
Common types of electives include: . 

*[[Computer]]s ([[word processing]], [[programming]], [[graphic design]])
*[[Sport|Athletics]] ([[cross country running|cross country]], [[American football|football]], [[baseball]], [[basketball]], [[track and field]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[tennis]], [[artistic gymnastics|gymnastics]], [[water polo]], [[association football|soccer]], [[softball]], [[scholastic wrestling|wrestling]], [[cheerleading]], [[volleyball]], [[lacrosse]], [[ice hockey]], [[field hockey]], [[sport rowing|crew]], [[boxing]], [[skiing]]/[[snowboarding]], [[golf]], [[mountain biking]])
*Career and Technical Education (Agriculture/Agriscience, Business/Marketing, Family and Consumer Science, Health Occupations, and Technology Education, including [[Publishing]] ([[journalism]]/[[student newspaper]], [[yearbook]]/annual, [[literary magazine]]))
*[[Performing Arts]]/[[Visual Arts]], ([[choir]], [[School band|band]], [[orchestra]], [[drama]], [[art]], [[ceramics]], [[photography]], and [[dance]])
*[[Foreign language]]s (Spanish and French are common; [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] are less common)<ref>[http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d04/tables/dt04_057.asp Enrollment in foreign language courses]. National Center for Education Statistics. Retrieved January 16, 2006. </ref>
*[[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] . 

=====Advanced courses=====. 
{{refimprove section|date=March 2011}}
Many high schools provide [[Advanced Placement Program|Advanced Placement]] (AP) or [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB) courses.  These are special forms of honors classes where the [[curriculum]] is more challenging and lessons more aggressively paced than standard courses. AP or IB courses are usually taken during the 11th or 12th grade of high school, but may be taken as early as 9th grade.  . 

Most post-secondary institutions take AP or IB exam results into consideration in the admissions process.  Because AP and IB courses are intended to be the equivalent of the first year of college courses, post-secondary institutions may grant unit credit, which enables students to graduate earlier.  Other institutions use examinations for placement purposes only: students are exempted from introductory course work but may not receive credit towards a concentration, degree, or core requirement.  Institutions vary in the selection of examinations they accept and the scores they require to grant credit or placement, with more elite institutions tending to accept fewer examinations and requiring higher scoring.  The lack of AP, IB, and other advanced courses in impoverished inner-city high schools is often seen as a major cause of the greatly differing levels of post-secondary education these graduates go on to receive, compared with both public and private schools in wealthier neighborhoods.  . 

Also, in states with well-developed [[community college]] systems, there are often mechanisms by which gifted students may seek permission from their school district to attend community college courses full-time during the summer, and part-time during the school year.  The units earned this way can often be transferred to one's university, and can facilitate early graduation. [[Early college entrance program]]s are a step further, with students enrolling as freshmen at a younger-than-traditional age.  . 

===Home schooling===. 
{{Main|Homeschooling in the United States}}
In 2007, approximately 1.5 million children were homeschooled, up 74% from 1999 when the U.S. Department of Education first started keeping statistics. This was 2.9% of all children. <ref name="bfp090105">{{cite book | author = Lloyd, Janice, Gannett News Service |title = Home-schooling numbers rise | publisher = Burlington Free Press | date = January 5, 2008}}</ref> . 

Many select moral or religious reasons for homeschooling their children. The second main category is "unschooling," those who prefer a non-standard approach to education. <ref name="bfp090105"/> . 

Most homeschooling advocates are wary of the established educational institutions for various reasons.  Some are religious conservatives who see nonreligious education as contrary to their moral or religious systems, or who wish to add religious instruction to the educational curriculum (and who may be unable to afford a church-operated private school or where the only available school may teach views contrary to those of the parents).  Others feel that they can more effectively tailor a curriculum to suit an individual student’s academic strengths and weaknesses, especially those with singular needs or disabilities.  Still others feel that the negative social pressures of schools (such as bullying, drugs, crime, sex, and other school-related problems) are detrimental to a child’s proper development.  Parents often form groups to help each other in the homeschooling process, and may even assign classes to different parents, similar to public and private schools.  . 

Opposition to homeschooling comes from varied sources, including teachers' organizations and school districts.  The [[National Education Association]], the largest [[trade union|labor union]] in the United States, has been particularly vocal in the past. <ref>Aronold, Dave. [http://www.nea.org/espcolumns/dv040220.html Home Schools Run By Well-Meaning Amateurs]. National Education Association. Retrieved February 19, 2005. </ref> Opponents' stated concerns fall into several broad categories, including fears of poor academic quality, loss of income for the schools, and religious or social extremism, or lack of socialization with others.  At this time, over half of states have oversight into monitoring or measuring the academic progress of home schooled students, with all but ten requiring some form of notification to the state. <ref>[http://www.hslda.org/laws/default.asp Home School Legal Defense Association]. Retrieved February 13, 2007. </ref> . 

==Grading scale==. 
In schools in the United States children are continually assessed throughout the school year by their teachers, and [[report card]]s are issued to parents at varying intervals. Generally the scores for individual assignments and tests are recorded for each student in a grade book, along with the maximum number of points for each assignment. At any time, the total number of points for a student when divided by the total number of possible points produces a percent grade, which can be translated to a letter grade.  Letter grades are often but not always used on report cards at the end of a marking period, although the current grade may be available at other times (particularly when an electronic grade book connected to an online service is in use). Although grading scales usually differ from school to school, the most common grade scale is letter grades—"A" through "F"—derived from a scale of 0–100 or a percentile. In some areas, Texas or Virginia for example, the "D" grade (or that between 70–60) is considered a failing grade. In other jurisdictions, such as [[Hawaii]], a "D" grade is considered passing in certain classes, and failing in others. {{fact|date=December 2011}} .

===Standardized testing===. 
{{See also|Test (student assessment)}}
Under the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], all American states must [[test (student assessment)|test]] students in public schools statewide to ensure that they are achieving the desired level of minimum education,<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.ed.gov/nclb/overview/intro/execsumm.html Executive Summary of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001]. U.S. Department of Education. Retrieved February 20, 2006. </ref> such as on the [[Regents Examinations]] in [[New York]], or the [[Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test]] (FCAT), and the [[Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System]] (MCAS); students being educated at home or in private schools are not included. The act also requires that students and schools show "[[adequate yearly progress]]." This means they must show some improvement each year. When a student fails to make adequate yearly progress, No Child Left Behind mandates that remediation through summer school and/or tutoring be made available to a student in need of extra help.  . 

During high school, students (usually in [[Eleventh grade|11th grade]]) may take one or more standardized [[test (student assessment)|tests]] depending on their postsecondary education preferences and their local graduation requirements. In theory, these tests evaluate the overall level of knowledge and learning aptitude of the students. The [[SAT]] and [[ACT (test)|ACT]] are the most common standardized tests that students take when applying to [[college]]. A student may take the SAT, ACT, or both depending upon the [[higher education|post-secondary institutions]] the student plans to apply to for admission. Most competitive schools also require two or three [[SAT Subject Tests]] (formerly known as SAT IIs), which are shorter exams that focus strictly on a particular subject matter. However, all these tests serve little to no purpose for students who do not move on to post-secondary education, so they can usually be skipped without affecting one's ability to graduate.  . 

===Extracurricular activities===. 
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
A major characteristic of American schools is the high priority given to sports, clubs and activities by the community, the parents, the schools and the students themselves.  Extracurricular activities are educational activities not falling within the scope of the regular curriculum but under the supervision of the school.  These activities can extend to large amounts of time outside the normal school day; home-schooled students, however, are not normally allowed to participate. Student participation in [[sport]]s programs, [[drill team]]s, [[band (music)|band]]s, and spirit groups can amount to hours of practices and performances. Most [[U.S. state|state]]s have organizations that develop rules for competition between groups. These organizations are usually forced to implement time limits on hours practiced as a prerequisite for participation. Many schools also have non-varsity sports teams; however, these are usually afforded less resources and attention.  . 

Sports programs and their related games, especially [[High school football in North America|football]] and/or [[basketball]], are major events for American students and for larger schools can be a major source of funds for [[school district]]s.  . 

High school athletic competitions often generate intense interest in the community.    . 

In addition to sports, numerous non-athletic extracurricular activities are available in American schools, both public and private. Activities include [[Quizbowl]], musical groups, marching bands, student government, school newspapers, science fairs, debate teams, and clubs focused on an academic area (such as the Spanish Club) or cultural interests (such as Key Club).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} . 

===Education of students with special needs===. 
{{Main|Special education in the United States}}
Commonly known as ''special classes'', are taught by teachers with training in adapting curricula to meet the needs of students with special needs.  . 

According to the [[School nursing#United States|National Association of School Nurses]], 5% of students in 2009 have a seizure disorder, another 5% have [[ADHD]] and 10% have mental or emotional problems. <ref name="scm0903"/> . 

====Educating children with disabilities====. 
{{refimprove section|date=March 2011}}
The federal law, [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) requires states to ensure that all government-run schools provide services to meet the individual needs of [[special education|students with special needs]], as defined by the law. <ref>[http://www.ed.gov/policy/speced/guid/idea/idea2004.html IDEA 2004 Resources]. U.S. Department of Education. Retrieved February 16, 2006. </ref>  All students with special needs are entitled to a [[free and appropriate public education]] (FAPE).  . 

Schools meet with the parents or guardians to develop an [[Individualized Education Program]] that determines best placement for the child.  Students must be placed in the [[least restrictive environment]] (LRE) that is appropriate for the student's needs.  Public schools that fail to provide an appropriate placement for students with special needs can be taken to due process wherein parents may formally submit their grievances and demand appropriate services for the child. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} . 

====Criticism====. 
At-risk students (those with educational needs that aren't associated with a disability) are often placed in classes with students with minor emotional and social disabilities. <ref>''Teaching exceptional, diverse, and at-risk students in the general education'' S Vaughn, CS Bos, JS Schumm – 1999</ref>  Critics assert that placing at-risk students in the same classes as these disabled students may impede the educational progress of both the at-risk and the disabled students.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Some research has refuted this claim, and has suggested this approach increases the academic and behavioral skills of the entire student population. <ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0959-4752(03)00068-9 | last1 = Gillies | first1 = R.M. | year = 2004 | title = The effects of cooperative learning on junior high school students during small group learning | url = | journal = Learning and Instruction | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 197–213 }}</ref>

===Public and private schools===. 
In the United States, state and local government have primary responsibility for education. The Federal Department of Education plays a role in standards setting and education finance, and some military primary and secondary schools are run by the Department of Defense. <ref name=doe2>[http://www.ed.gov/about/overview/fed/role.html?src=ln Federal Role in Education]. United States Department of Education. Retrieved February 16, 2006. </ref> . 

[[K-12]] students in most areas have a choice between free tax-funded [[public school (government funded)|public schools]], or privately-funded [[private school]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} . 

Public school systems are supported by a combination of local, state, and federal government funding. Because a large portion of school revenues come from local property taxes, public schools vary widely in the resources they have available per student. Class size also varies from one district to another. Curriculum decisions in public schools are made largely at the local and state levels; the federal government has limited influence. In most districts, a locally elected school board runs schools. The school board appoints an official called the superintendent of schools to manage the schools in the district. The largest public school system in the United States is in [[Education in New York City|New York City]], where more than one million students are taught in 1,200 separate public schools. Because of its immense size – there are more students in the system than residents in eight US states – the New York City public school system is nationally influential in determining standards and materials, such as textbooks.  . 

Admission to individual public schools is usually based on residency. To compensate for differences in school quality based on geography, school systems serving large cities and portions of large cities often have "[[magnet school]]s" that provide enrollment to a specified number of non-resident students in addition to serving all resident students. This special enrollment is usually decided by lottery with equal numbers of males and females chosen. Some magnet schools
cater to gifted students or to students with special interests, such as the sciences or performing arts. <ref name=eric>Klauke, Amy. [http://www.ericdigests.org/pre-928/magnet.htm Magnet schools]. ERIC Clearinghouse on Educational Management. Retrieved February 21, 005. </ref> . 

Private schools in the United States include parochial schools (affiliated with religious denominations), non-profit independent schools, and for-profit private schools. Private schools charge varying rates depending on geographic location, the school's expenses, and the availability of funding from sources, other than tuition. For example, some churches partially subsidize private schools for their members. Some people have argued that when their child attends a private school, they should be able to take the funds that the public school no longer needs and apply that money towards private school tuition in the form of [[School voucher|vouchers]]. This is the basis of the [[school choice]] movement.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} . 

5,072,451 students attended 33,740 private elementary and secondary schools in 2007. 74.5% of these were Caucasian, non-Hispanic, 9.8% were African American, 9.6% were Hispanic. 5.4% were Asian or Pacific Islander, and .6% were American Indian<!---sic--->. Average school size was 150.3 students. There were 456,266 teachers. The number of students per teacher was about 11. 65% of seniors in private schools in 2006-7 went on to attend a 4-year college. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/01/AR2009110101878.html |title=A look at private schools |accessdate= |author=Michael Birnbaum |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2009-11-02 |year= |month= |work= Washington Post |publisher=Washington Post |pages=B2 |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref><!--as usual, box graphics are missing from online article, nor are the figures cited mentioned in the online article---> . 

Private schools have various missions: some cater to college-bound students seeking a competitive edge in the college admissions process; others are for gifted students, students with learning disabilities or other special needs, or students with specific religious affiliations. Some cater to families seeking a small school, with a nurturing, supportive environment. Unlike public school systems, private schools have no legal obligation to accept any interested student. Admission to some private schools is often highly selective. Private schools also have the ability to permanently expel persistently unruly students, a disciplinary option not legally available to public school systems. Private schools offer the advantages of smaller classes, under twenty students in a typical elementary classroom, for example; a higher teacher/student ratio across the school day, greater individualized attention and in the more competitive schools, [[expert]] college placement services. Unless specifically designed to do so, private schools usually cannot offer the services required by students with serious or multiple learning, emotional, or behavioral issues. Although reputed to pay lower salaries than public school systems, private schools often attract teachers by offering high-quality professional development opportunities, including tuition grants for advanced degrees. According to elite private schools themselves, this investment in faculty development helps maintain the high quality program that they offer.  . 

An August 17, 2000 article by the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' refers to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago]] Office of Catholic Schools as the largest private school system in the United States. <ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20000817/ai_n13867054 ]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref> .

Like high school, the four undergraduate grades are commonly called freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior years (alternatively called first year, second year, etc.). Students traditionally apply for admission into colleges. Schools differ in their competitiveness and reputation; generally, the most prestigious schools are private, rather than public. Admissions criteria involve the rigor and grades earned in high school courses taken, the students' [[grade point average|GPA]], class ranking, and standardized [[test (student assessment)|test]] scores (Such as the SAT or the ACT tests). Most colleges also consider more subjective factors such as a commitment to extracurricular activities, a personal essay, and an interview. While colleges will rarely list that they require a certain standardized test score, class ranking, or GPA for admission, each college usually has a rough threshold below which admission is unlikely.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} . 

[[File:Engineering Hall.jpg|thumb|150px|Engineering Hall at [[The University of Illinois]]]]
Once admitted, students engage in ''undergraduate study'', which consists of satisfying university and class requirements to achieve a [[bachelor's degree]] in a field of concentration known as a [[Academic major|major]]. (Some students enroll in [[double degree|double majors]] or "minor" in another field of study.) The most common method consists of four years of study leading to a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (B.A.), a [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.S.), or sometimes another bachelor's degree such as [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] (B.F.A.), [[Bachelor of Social Work]] (B.S.W.), [[Bachelor of Engineering]] (B.Eng.,) or [[Bachelor of Philosophy]] (B.Phil.) Five-Year Professional Architecture programs offer the [[Bachelor of Architecture]] Degree (B.Arch.) . 

Professional degrees such as law, medicine, pharmacy, and dentistry, are offered as graduate study after earning at least three years of undergraduate schooling or after earning a bachelor's degree depending on the program. These professional fields do not require a specific undergraduate major, though medicine, pharmacy, and dentistry have set prerequisite courses that must be taken before enrollment.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} .

Some students choose to attend a community college for two years prior to further study at another college or university. In most states, community colleges are operated either by a division of the state university or by local special districts subject to guidance from a state agency. Community colleges may award Associate of Arts (AA) or Associate of Science (AS) degree after two years. Those seeking to continue their education may transfer to a four-year college or university (after applying through a similar admissions process as those applying directly to the four-year institution, see [[articulation (education)|articulation]]). Some community colleges have automatic enrollment agreements with a local four-year college, where the community college provides the first two years of study and the university provides the remaining years of study, sometimes all on one campus. The community college awards the associate's degree, and the university awards the bachelor's and master's degrees.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} .

''Graduate study'', conducted after obtaining an initial degree and sometimes after several years of professional work, leads to a more advanced degree such as a [[master's degree]], which could be a [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]] (MA), [[Master of Science]] (MS), [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA), or other less common master's degrees such as [[Master of Education]] (MEd), and [[Master of Fine Arts]] (MFA). Some students pursue a graduate degree that is in between a master's degree and a doctoral degree called a [[Specialist in Education]] (Ed.S.). <!---it is unclear if the preceding sentence was intended to segue into the following sentence. It has muddled the intent, IMO. A Ed. S. is generally not going to try for a Doctor of Medicine, for example. The two need to be clearly separated IMO--> . 

After additional years of study and sometimes in conjunction with the completion of a master's degree and/or Ed.S. degree, students may earn a Doctor of Philosophy ([[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]) or other doctoral degree, such as [[Doctor of Arts]], [[Ed.D.|Doctor of Education]], [[Doctor of Theology]], [[Doctor of Medicine]], [[Doctor of Pharmacy]], [[Doctor of Physical Therapy]], [[D.O.|Doctor of Osteopathy]], [[D.P.M.|Doctor of Podiatry Medicine]], [[Doctor of Veterinary Medicine]], [[Psy.D.|Doctor of Psychology]], or [[Juris Doctor]]. Some programs, such as medicine and psychology, have formal apprenticeship procedures post-graduation, such as residencies and internships, which must be completed after graduation and before one is considered fully trained. Other professional programs like law and business have no formal apprenticeship requirements after graduation (although law school graduates must take the [[bar exam]] to legally practice law in nearly all states).  . 

Entrance into graduate programs usually depends upon a student's undergraduate academic performance or professional experience as well as their score on a standardized entrance exam like the [[Graduate Record Examination]] (GRE-graduate schools in general), the [[Medical College Admission Test]] (MCAT), or the [[Law School Admission Test]] (LSAT). Many graduate and law schools do not require experience after earning a bachelor's degree to enter their programs; however, business school candidates are usually required to gain a few years of professional work experience before applying. 8.9 percent of students receive postgraduate degrees. Most, after obtaining their bachelor's degree, proceed directly into the workforce. <ref>[http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d04/tables/dt04_011.asp Educational attainment of persons 18 years old and over].

A few charity institutions cover all of the students' tuition, although scholarships (both merit-based and need-based) are widely available. Generally, private universities charge much higher tuition than their public counterparts, which rely on state funds to make up the difference. Because each state supports its own university system with state taxes, most public universities charge much higher rates for out-of-state students.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} . 

Annual undergraduate tuition varies widely from state to state, and many additional fees apply. In 2009, average annual tuition at a public university (for residents of the state) was $7,020. <ref name="wp0910222"/> Tuition for public school students from outside the state is generally comparable to private school prices, although students can often qualify for state residency after their first year. Private schools are typically much higher, although prices vary widely from "no-frills" private schools to highly specialized technical institutes. Depending upon the type of school and program, annual graduate program tuition can vary from $15,000 to as high as $50,000. Note that these prices do not include living expenses (rent, room/board, etc.) or additional fees that schools add on such as "activities fees" or [[health insurance]]. These fees, especially room and board, can range from $6,000 to $12,000 per academic year (assuming a single student without children). <ref name=collegeboard>[http://www.collegeboard.com/press/article/0,3183,29541,00.html Tuition Levels Rise but Many Students Pay Significantly Less than Published Rates].

College costs are rising at the same time that state appropriations for aid are shrinking. This has led to debate over funding at both the state and local levels. From 2002 to 2004 alone, tuition rates at public schools increased over 14 percent, largely due to dwindling state funding. An increase of 6 percent occurred over the same period for private schools. <ref name="collegeboard"/> Between 1982 and 2007, college tuition and fees rose three times as fast as median family income, in constant dollars. <ref name="bfp081207">{{cite book | author = Broder, David S.

To combat costs colleges have hired adjunct professors to teach. In 2008 these teachers cost about $1,800 per 3-credit class as opposed to $8,000 per class for a tenured professor. Two-thirds of college instructors were adjuncts. There are differences of opinion whether these adjuncts teach better or worse than regular professors. There is a suspicion that student evaluation of adjuncts, along with their subsequent continued employment, can lead to [[grade inflation]]. <ref>{{cite book | author = Clark, Kim |title = Does it Matter That Your Professor Is Part Time? | publisher = US News and World Report | date = November 17–24, 2008}}</ref> . 

===The status ladder===. 
{{refimprove section|date=March 2011}}
American college and university faculty, staff, alumni, students, and applicants monitor [[College and university rankings|rankings]] produced by magazines such as ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'', [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]], test preparation services such as [[The Princeton Review]] or another university itself such as the Top American Research Universities by the University of Florida's The Center. <ref name=thecenter>{{cite web |url=http://thecenter.ufl.edu/research.html |title=The Top American Research Universities |accessdate=2006-11-07 |work=The Center (University of Florida)}}</ref> <!--<ref>[http://www.dailypennsylvanian.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2006/02/02/43e1c030461a5 Criticism unlikely to tarnish image]. dailypennsylvanian.com.

Also renowned within the United States are the so-called "[[Little Ivies]]" and a number of prestigious [[liberal arts college]]s.  Certain public universities (sometimes referred to as "[[Public Ivies]]") are also recognized for their outstanding record in scholarship. Some of these institutions currently place among the elite in certain measurements of graduate education and research, especially among engineering and medical schools. <ref name="Top American Research Universities">[http://thecenter.ufl.edu/research.html the Top American Research Universities by University of Florida TheCenter]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/eng/brief/engrank_brief.php |title=America's Best Graduate Schools 2008: Top Engineering Schools |publisher=usnews.com |accessdate= June 18, 2007}}</ref> . 

Each state in the United States maintains its own [[public university]] system, which is always non-profit. The [[State University of New York]] and the [[California State University]] are the largest public higher education systems in the United States; SUNY is the largest system that includes community colleges, while CSU is the largest without. Most areas also have [[private university|private institutions]], which may be for-profit or non-profit. Unlike many other nations, there are no public universities at the national level outside of the [[U.S. Armed Forces|military]] [[United States military academies|service academies]].  . 

Prospective students applying to attend four of the five [[United States military academies|military academies]] require, with limited exceptions, nomination by a member of [[United States Congress|Congress]]. Like acceptance to "top tier" universities, competition for these limited nominations is intense and must be accompanied by superior scholastic achievement and evidence of "leadership potential." . 

Aside from these aforementioned schools, academic reputations vary widely among the 'middle-tier' of American schools, (and even among academic departments within each of these schools.) Most public and private institutions fall into this 'middle' range. Some institutions feature honors colleges or other rigorous programs that challenge academically exceptional students, who might otherwise attend a 'top-tier' college. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUNY_Honors_College#The_Honors_College |title=City University of New York – Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref><ref>[[Schreyer Honors College]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.valpo.edu/christc/ |title=Christ College – The Honors College of Valparaiso University |publisher=Valpo.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baylor.edu/honors_college/splash.php |title=Baylor University &#124;&#124; Honors College |publisher=Baylor.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref> Aware of the status attached to the perception of the college that they attend, students often apply to a range of schools. Some apply to a relatively prestigious school with a low acceptance rate, gambling on the chance of acceptance, and also apply to a "[[Wiktionary:Safety school|safety school]]",<ref>[http://www.dailytargum.com/media/paper168/news/2006/01/19/PageOne/More-Than.A.safety.School-1477734.shtml?norewrite&sourcedomain=www.dailytargum.com More than a 'safety school']. The Daily Targum. Retrieved February 16, 2005. </ref> to which they will (almost) certainly gain admission.  . 

Lower status institutions include [[community college]]s. These are primarily two-year public institutions, which individual states usually require to accept all local residents who seek admission, and offer [[associate's degree]]s or vocational certificate programs. Many community colleges have relationships with four-year state universities and colleges or even private universities that enable their students to transfer to these universities for a four-year degree after completing a two-year program at the community college.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} . 

Regardless of perceived prestige, many institutions feature at least one distinguished academic department, and most post-secondary American students attend one of the 2,400 four-year colleges and universities or 1,700 two-year colleges not included among the twenty-five or so 'top-tier' institutions. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0908742.html |title=Number of U.S. Colleges and Universities and Degrees Awarded, 2005 — |publisher=Infoplease.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref> . 

===Criticism===. 
A college economics professor has blamed "credential inflation" for the admission of so many unqualified students into college. He reports that the number of new jobs requiring college degrees is less than the number of college graduates. <ref name="wp100606"/> The same professor reports that the more money that a state spends on higher education, the slower the economy grows, the opposite of long held notions. <ref name="wp100606"/> . 

==Reading and writing habits==. 
Libraries have been considered important to educational goals. <ref>[http://www.doe.mass.edu/news/news.aspx?id=761]</ref>
Library books are more readily available to Americans than to people in Germany, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Austria and all the Mediterranean nations. The average American borrowed more library books in 2001 than his or her peers in Germany, Austria, Norway, Ireland, Luxembourg, France and throughout the Mediterranean. <ref name="Trans-Atlantic Comparisons 2">{{cite news| url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,628385,00.html | publisher=Spiegel Online | title=Trans-Atlantic Comparisons, part 2: Why Europeans Have It Wrong About Americans | date=May 6, 2009}}</ref>

==Contemporary education issues==. 
<!---in some cases the below ONLY refers to elementary-high school issues. In others, undergraduate education is included. This need to be more clearly delineated IMO--->
{{See also|Education reform}}
Major educational issues in the United States center on curriculum, funding, and control. Of critical importance, because of its enormous implications on education and funding, is the [[No Child Left Behind Act]]. <ref name="autogenerated1"/> . 

===Tracking===. 
{{See also|Tracking (education)}} . 

Tracking is the practice of dividing students at the primary or secondary school level into separate classes, depending if the student is high, average, or low achievers. It also offers different curriculum paths for students headed for college and for those who are bound directly for the workplace or technical schools.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} . 

===Curriculum issues===. 
[[File:No Child Left Behind Act.jpg|thumb|275px|[[U.S. President|President]] [[George W. Bush]] signing the [[No Child Left Behind Act]]]]
Curricula in the United States vary widely from district to district. Not only do schools offer a range of topics and quality, but private schools may include religious classes as mandatory for attendance. This raises the question of government funding vouchers in states with anti-Catholic [[Blaine Amendments]] in their constitution. This has produced camps of argument over the standardization of curricula and to what degree.  These same groups often are advocates of standardized testing, which is mandated by the [[No Child Left Behind Act]].  . 

There is debate over which subjects should receive the most focus, with astronomy and geography among those cited as not being taught enough in schools. <ref>{{cite web|title=Astronomy Education in the United States|url=http://www.astrosociety.org/education/resources/useduc03.html|publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific|accessdate=22 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=What is GENIP?|url=http://genip.tamu.edu/|publisher=Geographic Education National Implementation Project|accessdate=22 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://geography.about.com/library/misc/bldeblij1.htm |title=Geographic Education and Public Policy |author=Harm de Blij |date=3 November 1999 |publisher=About.com |accessdate=21 October 2010}}
</ref> . 

====English in the classroom====. 
An issue facing curricula today is the use of the English language in teaching. English is spoken by over 95% of the nation, and there is a strong national tradition of upholding English as the [[de facto]] official language {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. Some 9.7 million children aged 5 to 17 primarily speak a language other than English at home. Of those, about 1.3 million children do not speak English well or at all. <ref>[http://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/phc-t20.html Summary Tables on Language Use and English Ability: 2000]. United States Census (2000). Retrieved February 6, 2006. </ref> . 

====Attainment====. 
Forty-four percent of college faculty believe that incoming students aren't ready for writing at the college level. Ninety percent of  high school teachers believe exiting students are well-prepared. <ref>[http://www.indianapoliswoman.com/archive.asp?r=\2006\oct\special-sections\education\ed9.txt indianapoliswoman.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.neumont.edu/cmsdocuments/Spellings_Report.pdf neumont.edu] page 14</ref><ref>[http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/hiedfuture/reports/0809-draft.pdf ed.gov]; page 10</ref><ref>[http://www.scribd.com/doc/2964561/Commission-on-Higher-Education-Report-2006 scribd.com] page 25</ref> . 

Drop out rates are a concern in American four year colleges. In New York, 54 percent of students entering four-year colleges in 1997 had a degree six years later — and even fewer Hispanics and blacks did. <ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10053859/ "U.S. college drop-out rate sparks concern"], [[MSNBC]], November 15, 2005</ref> 33 percent of the freshmen who enter the [[University of Massachusetts Boston]] graduate within six years.

Since the 1980s the number of educated Americans has continued to grow, but at a slower rate.  Some have attributed this to an increase in the foreign born portion of the workforce.  However, the decreasing growth of the educational workforce has instead been primarily due to slowing down in educational attainment of people schooled in the United States. <ref>Goldin, C., Katz, L.F.

==== Violence and drug use====. 
Violence is a problem in high schools, depending on the size and level of the school. Between 1996 and September 2003, at least 46 students and teachers were killed in 27 incidents involving the use of firearms.  Information from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that, in 2001, students between the ages of 12 and 18 were the victims of 2 million crimes in US schools. 62% of the crimes were thefts.  Between July 1999 and June 2000, 24 murders and 8 suicides took place in American schools.  . 

Also in 2001, 47% of American high school students drank alcohol at least once; 5% drank right on school territory.  24% of high school students smoked marijuana, 5% smoking right at school.  29% of students who smoke marijuana obtain the drug at school. <ref>[http://www.washprofile.org/en/node/1894 "Problems with the U.S. Education System"] Washington Profile, October 1, 2009</ref> . 

====Sex education====. 
{{Main|Sex education in the United States}}
Almost all students in the U.S. receive some form of sex education at least once between grades 7 and 12; many schools begin addressing some topics as early as grades 4 or 5. <ref>{{cite journal|coauthors = David J. Landry, Susheela Singh and Jacqueline E. Darroch|year = 2000|month = September/October|title = Sexuality Education in Fifth and Sixth Grades in U.S. Public Schools, 1999|journal = Family Planning Perspectices|volume = 32|issue = 5|pages =|id =|url = http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3221200.html|accessdate = 2007-05-23}}</ref> However, what students learn varies widely, because curriculum decisions are so decentralized. Many states have laws governing what is taught in sex education classes or allowing parents to opt out. Some state laws leave curriculum decisions to individual school districts. <ref name="Kaiser 2002">{{cite web|url = http://www.kff.org/youthhivstds/upload/Sex-Education-in-the-U-S-Policy-and-Politics.pdf|title = Sex Education in the U.S.: Policy and Politics|accessdate = 2007-05-23|year = 2002|month = October|format = PDF|work = Issue Update|publisher = Kaiser Family Foundation}}</ref>
For example, a 1999 study by the [[Guttmacher Institute]] found that most U.S. sex education courses in grades 7 through 12 cover puberty, [[HIV]], [[Sexually transmitted disease|STDs]], [[abstinence]], implications of teenage [[pregnancy]], and how to resist peer pressure. Other studied topics, such as methods of [[birth control]] and infection prevention, [[sexual orientation]], [[sexual abuse]], and factual and ethical information about [[abortion]], varied more widely. <ref>{{cite journal|coauthors = Jacqueline E. Darroch, David J.

However, according to a 2004 survey, a majority of the 1001 parent groups polled wants complete sex education in the schools. The American people are heavily divided over the issue. Over 80% of polled parents agreed with the statement "Sex education in school makes it easier for me to talk to my child about sexual issues," while under 17% agreed with the statement that their children were being exposed to "subjects I don't think my child should be discussing." 10 percent believed that their children's sexual education class forced them to discuss sexual issues "too early." On the other hand, 49 percent of the respondents (the largest group) were "somewhat confident" that the values taught in their children's sex ed classes were similar to those taught at home, and 23 percent were less confident still. (The [[margin of error]] was plus or minus 4.7 percent.)<ref>[http://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2004/jan/kaiserpoll/publicfinal.pdf Sex Education in America – General Public/Parents Survey]. NPR/Kaiser/Harvard survey (2004). Retrieved June 17, 2005. </ref> . 

====Textbook review and adoption====. 
In many localities in the United States, the curriculum taught in public schools is influenced by the textbooks used by the teachers. In some states, textbooks are selected for all students at the state level. Since states such as California and Texas represent a considerable market for textbook publishers, these states can exert influence over the content of the books. <ref>[http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2010/1001.blake.html Revisionaries: How a group of Texas conservatives is rewriting your kids' textbooks]. Washington Monthly, January/February 2010. Retrieved April 7, 2010. </ref> . 

In 2010, the Texas Board of Education adopted new Social Studies standards that could potentially impact the content of textbooks purchased in other parts of the country. The deliberations that resulted in the new standards were partisan in nature and are said to reflect a conservative leaning in the view of United States history. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/13/education/13texas.html Texas Conservatives win Curriculum Change]. New York Times article. Retrieved April 7, 2010. </ref> . 

As of January 2009, the four largest college textbook publishers in the United States were:
* [[Pearson Education]] (including such imprints as [[Addison-Wesley]] and [[Prentice Hall]])
* [[Cengage Learning]] (formerly Thomson Learning)
* [[McGraw-Hill]]
* [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] . 

Other US textbook publishers include:
* [[John Wiley & Sons]]
* [[Jones and Bartlett Publishers]]
* [[F. A. Davis Company]]
* [[W. W. Norton & Company]]
* [[SAGE Publications]]
* [[Flat World Knowledge]] . 

===Cheating===. 
{{Main|Academic dishonesty}}
From 50% to 95% of American students admit to cheating in high school or college at one time or another. These poll results cast some doubt on measured academic attainment tests. <ref>''[[Reader's Digest]]'', pp. 123-7, March 2006; Cheating: "but everybody is doing it". </ref> . 

===Funding===. 
====Funding for K–12 schools====. 
According to a 2005 report from the [[OECD]], the United States is tied for first place with Switzerland when it comes to annual spending per student on its public schools, with each of those two countries spending more than $11,000 (in U.S. currency). <ref>[http://www.oecd.org/document/34/0,2340,en_2649_201185_35341645_1_1_1_1,00.html OECD calls for broader access to post-school education and training], OECD, September 13, 2005</ref> However, the United States is ranked 37th in the world in education spending as a percentage of gross domestic product. All but seven of the leading countries are in the third world; ranked high because of a low GDP. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/edu_edu_spe-education-spending-of-gdp |title=Education Spending Statistics |publisher=nationmaster.com}}</ref> U.S. public schools lag behind the schools of other developed countries in the areas of reading, math, and science. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siteselection.com/ssinsider/snapshot/sf011210.htm |title=Who's No. 1?

According to a 2007 article in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the Washington D.C. public school district spends $12,979 per student per year. This is the third highest level of funding per student out of the 100 biggest school districts in the U.S. According to the article, however, these schools are ranked last in the amount of funding spent on teachers and instruction, and first on the amount spent on administration. The school district has produced outcomes that are lower than the national average. In reading and math, the district's students score the lowest among 11 major school districts – even when poor children are compared with other poor children. 33% of poor fourth graders in the U.S. lack basic skills in math, but in Washington D.C., it's 62%. <ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/09/AR2007060901415.html?hpid=topnews Can D.C. Schools Be Fixed?], The Washington Post, June 10, 2007</ref> In 2004, the U.S. Congress set up a voucher program for low income minority students in Washington D.C. to attend private schools. The vouchers were $7,500 per student per year. The parents said their children were receiving a much better education from the private schools. In 2007, Washington D.C. non-voting delegate [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]] said she wanted the voucher program to be eliminated, and that the public schools needed more money. <ref>[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/jul/29/future-of-dc-school-vouchers-worries-parents/ Future of D.C. school vouchers worries parents], The Washington Times, July 29, 2007</ref> [[Secretary of Education]] [[Arne Duncan]] supports retaining vouchers for the district only, as do some DC parent groups. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2009-03-04-duncan-vouchers_N.htm |title=Secretary Duncan wants D.C. kids to keep vouchers |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2009-03-04 |accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Lester |first=Natalie |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/feb/27/dc-parents-to-push-congress-to-keep-vouchers/ |title=D.C. parents to push to keep vouchers |publisher=Washington Times |date=2009-02-27 |accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref> . 

According to a 2006 study by the [[Goldwater Institute]], Arizona's public schools spend 50% more per student than Arizona's private schools. The study also says that while teachers constitute 72% of the employees at private schools, they make up less than half of the staff at public schools. According to the study, if Arizona's public schools wanted to be like private schools, they would have to hire approximately 25,000 more teachers, and eliminate 21,210 administration employees. <ref>[http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2006/10/18/private-schools-now-33-off/  Private Schools Now 33% Off!], Cato Institute, October 18, 2006</ref> . 

During the 2006–2007 school year, a private school in Chicago founded by [[Marva Collins]] to teach low income minority students charged $5,500 for tuition, and parents said that the school did a much better job than the Chicago public school system. <ref>[http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?id=6188122&section=news/local Marva Collins School to close], ABC News, June 05, 2008</ref> However, Collins' school was forced to close in 2008 due to lack of sufficient enrollment and funding. <ref name=abc>[http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?id=6188122&section=news/local Marva Collins School to close], ABC News, 5 June 2008. </ref> Meanwhile, during the 2007–2008 year, Chicago public school officials claimed that their budget of $11,300 per student was not enough. <ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26515276/ Chicago students skip school in funding protest], Associated Press, September 2, 2008</ref> . 

In 1985 in Kansas City, Missouri, a judge ordered the school district to raise taxes and spend more money on public education. Spending was increased so much, that the school district was spending more money per student than any of the country's other 280 largest school districts with a charge to "dream" of the possibilities and to make them happen. Although this very high level of spending continued for more than a decade, there was no improvement in the school district's academic performance. <ref>[http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-298.html Money And School Performance: Lessons from the Kansas City Desegregation Experiment], Cato Institute, March 16, 1998</ref><ref>[http://www.amren.com/9512issue/9512issue.html Catastrophe in Kansas City], December 1995</ref> . 

Public school defenders answer that both of these examples are misleading, as the task of educating students is easier in private schools, which can expel or refuse to accept students who lag behind their peers in academic achievement or behavior, while public schools have no such recourse and must continue to attempt to educate these students. For this reason, comparisons of the cost of education in public schools to that of private schools is misleading; private school education can be accomplished with less funding because in most cases they educate those students who are easiest to teach. <ref name="unb.ca">{{cite web|author=Lawrence M.

But not in all cases. For example, [[Marva Collins]] created her low cost private school specifically for the purpose of teaching low income African American children whom the public school system had labeled as being "[[learning disabled]]". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marvacollins.com/comments.html |title=Marva Collins Seminars, Inc |publisher=Marvacollins.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref> One article about Marva Collins' school stated, "Working with students having the worst of backgrounds, those who were working far below grade level, and even those who had been labeled as 'unteachable,' Marva was able to overcome the obstacles. News of third grade students reading at ninth grade level, four-year-olds learning to read in a few months, outstanding test scores, disappearance of behavioral problems, second-graders studying Shakespeare, and other incredible reports, astounded the public." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edocere.org/articles/marva_collins.htm |title=Excerpts from Ordinary Children, Extraordinary Teachers and Marva Collins’ Way |publisher=Edocere.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref> . 

According to a 1999 article by [[William J. Bennett]], former U.S. Secretary of Education, increased levels of spending on public education have not made the schools better. Among many other things, the article cites the following statistics:<ref>[http://www.heartland.org/Article.cfm?artId=11200 20 Troubling Facts about American Education], William J. Bennett, October 1999</ref> . 

*Between 1960 and 1995, U.S. public school spending per student, adjusted for inflation, increased by 212%. 
*In 1994, less than half of all U.S. public school employees were teachers. 
*Out of 21 industrialized countries, U.S. 12th graders ranked 19th in math, 16th in science, and last in advanced physics.  . 

In 2011, the [[Center for American Progress]], described as a "left-leaning think tank" stated that for half the states studied, it found no correlation between spending and achievement after allowing for [[cost of living]], and students living in poverty. <ref name="ft110201">{{Cite news | first=Matt | last=Reed | title=Brevard cannot count on charters | url=| work= | newspaper=[[Florida Today]] | location=Melbourne, Florida | pages= 1B | date=1 February 2011 | id= | accessdate=}}</ref> .

Other commentators have suggested that the public school system has exhibited signs of success.  [[SAT]] scores have risen consistently over the past decades, despite the fact that the pool of students taking the test has increased from an academic elite to a much more representative sampling of the population.  Commentators have suggested that this increase in scores, coming as it does at a time when more students have started to take the test and the public schooling system has faced ever-increasing challenge, suggests that the US educational system is much more effective than is commonly believed, and that the negative cast common in public perception is due to negative propaganda disseminated by elements with a personal interest in discrediting or weakening public education. <ref name="commondreams.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0103-22.htm |title=Is Public Education Working?

<!--paragraph starts off well, addressing funding but then, after stating is gets some money from federal, seems to complain that it doesn't get enough. The overall message is in danger here whatever it was. I think the NCLB item should be deleted. It seems to detract--->
Funding for schools in the United States is complex. One current controversy stems much from the [[No Child Left Behind Act]]. The Act gives the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] the right to withhold funding if it believes a school, district, or even a state is not complying and is making no effort to comply. However, federal funding accounts for little of the overall funding schools receive. The vast majority comes from the state government and in some cases from local property taxes. Various groups, many of whom are teachers, constantly push for more funding. They point to many different situations, such as the fact that in many schools funding for classroom supplies is so inadequate that teachers, especially those at the elementary level, must supplement their supplies with purchases of their own. <ref name="autogenerated3">[http://www.learningexperts.com/McQuillan/Teachers%20Spend%20Money%20092102.pdf Teachers Dig Deeper to Fill Gap in Supplies]. New York Times article (2002). Retrieved June 26, 2005. </ref> . 

Property taxes as a primary source of funding for public education have become highly controversial, for a number of reasons.  First, if a state's population and land values escalate rapidly, many longtime residents may find themselves paying property taxes much higher than anticipated.  In response to this phenomenon, California's citizens passed [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|Proposition 13]] in 1978, which severely restricted the ability of the Legislature to expand the state's educational system to keep up with growth.  Some states, such as Michigan, have investigated or implemented alternate schemes for funding education that may sidestep the problems of funding based mainly on property taxes by providing funding based on sales or income tax.  These schemes also have failings, negatively impacting funding in a slow economy. <ref>[http://www.mlive.com/flintjournal/voices/index.ssf/2008/05/a_tax_increase_for_michigan_sc.html mlive.com], Flint Journal article (2008). Retrieved June 12, 2008. </ref> . 

One of the biggest debates in funding public schools is funding by local taxes or state taxes. The federal government supplies around 8.5% of the public school system funds, according to a 2005 report by the [[National Center for Education Statistics]]. The remaining split between state and local governments averages 48.7 percent from states and 42.8 percent from local sources. However, the division varies widely. In [[Hawaii]] local funds make up 1.7 percent, while state sources account for nearly 90.1 percent. <ref>[http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubs/npefs03/tables.asp Revenues and Expenditures for Public Elementary and Secondary Education, Table 1]. National Center for Education Statistics. Retrieved February 15, 2006. </ref> . 

The most expensive school in the United States was constructed by the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]] in 2010. It cost $578 million; served 4,200 K–12 students. <ref>{{Cite news | first=Christina | last=Hoag | title=Los Angeles school has $578M price tag | url=http://content.usatoday.net/dist/custom/gci/InsidePage.aspx?cId=burlingtonfreepress&sParam=34345865.story work= | publisher=Burlington Free Press | location=Burlington, Vermont | pages= 5A | date=23 August 2010 | id= | accessdate=}}</ref> . 

=====Judicial intervention=====. 
The reliance on local funding sources has led to a long history of court challenges about how states fund their schools.  These challenges have relied on interpretations of state constitutions after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that school funding was not a matter of the U.S. Constitution ([[San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez]], 411 U.S. 1 (1973)).  The state court cases, beginning with the California case of [[Serrano v. Priest]], 5 Cal.3d 584 (1971), were initially concerned with equity in funding, which was defined in terms of variations in spending across local school districts.  More recently, state court cases have begun to consider what has been called 'adequacy.'  These cases have questioned whether the total amount of spending was sufficient to meet state constitutional requirements.  Perhaps the most famous adequacy case is [[Abbott v. Burke]], 100 N.J. 269, 495 A.2d 376 (1985), which has involved state court supervision over several decades and has led to some of the highest spending of any U.S. districts in the so-called [[Abbott districts]].  The background and results of these cases are analyzed in a book by [[Eric Hanushek]] and Alfred Lindseth. <ref> [[Eric Hanushek|Eric A. Hanushek]] and Alfred A. Lindseth, ''Schoolhouses, Courthouses, and Statehouses: Solving the funding-achievement puzzle in America's public schools'' (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2010)</ref> That analysis concludes that funding differences are not closely related to student outcomes and thus that the outcomes of the court cases have not led to improved policies.  . 

====Funding for college====. 
At the college and university level student loan funding is split in half; half is managed by the Department of Education directly, called the Federal Direct Student Loan Program (FDSLP). The other half is managed by commercial entities such as banks, credit unions, and financial services firms such as [[Sallie Mae]], under the [[Federal Family Education Loan Program]] (FFELP). Some schools accept only FFELP loans; others accept only FDSLP. Still others accept both, and a few schools will not accept either, in which case students must seek out private alternatives for student loans. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gcc.edu/Student_Loans.php |title=Grove City College: Student Loans |publisher=gcc.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-10-06}}</ref> . 

===Charter schools===. 
{{Main|Charter school}}
{{Ref improve section|date=May 2009}}
The '''charter-school movement''' was born in 1990. [[Charter schools]] have spread rapidly in the United States, members, parents, teachers, and students" to allow for the "expression of diverse teaching philosophies and cultural and social life styles." <ref>Herbst, Juergen. ''School Choice and School Governance: A Historical Study of the United States and Germany'' page 107 2006.  ISBN 1-4039-7302-4</ref> . 

===Affirmative action===. 
In 2003 a Supreme Court decision concerning [[Affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]] in universities allowed educational institutions to consider race as a factor in admitting students, but ruled that strict point systems are unconstitutional. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/03highlts.html#2 |title=Highlights of the 2002–2003 Supreme Court Term |publisher=Supct.law.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref> Opponents of racial affirmative action argue that the program actually benefits middle- and upper-class [[people of color]] at the expense of lower class [[European Americans]] and [[Asian Americans]]. <ref>Hurst, C.

===Control===. 
There is some debate about where control for education actually lies. Education is not mentioned in the [[United States Constitution|constitution of the United States]]. In the current situation, the [[State governments of the United States|state]] and [[Federal government of the United States|national]] governments have a power-sharing arrangement, with the states exercising most of the control. Like other arrangements between the two, the federal government uses the threat of decreased funding to enforce laws pertaining to education. <ref name=doe2>[http://www.ed.gov/about/overview/fed/role.html?src=ln Federal Role in Education]. U.S. Department of Education. Retrieved February 16, 2006. </ref> Furthermore, within each state there are different types of control. Some states have a statewide school system, while others delegate power to [[county (US)|county]], [[city]] or [[township (United States)|township]]-level [[school board]]s. However, under the Bush administration, initiatives such as the ''No Child Left Behind Act'' have attempted to assert more central control in a heavily decentralized system.  . 

Many cities have their own school boards everywhere in the United States. With the exception of cities, outside the northeast U.S. school boards are generally constituted at the county level.  . 

The [[U.S. federal government]] exercises its control through the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]]. [[Educational accreditation]] decisions are made by [[regional accreditation|voluntary regional associations]]. Schools in the 50 states, the [[District of Columbia]], the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], [[Guam]], and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], teach in English, while schools in the commonwealth of [[Puerto Rico]] teach in Spanish. [[Nonprofit]] private schools are widespread, are largely independent of the government, and include secular as well as [[parochial school]]s.  . 

===International comparison===. 
In the [[OECD]]'s [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] 2003, which emphasizes problem solving, American 15 year olds ranked 24th of 38 in mathematics, 19th of 38 in science, 12th of 38 in reading, and 26th of 38 in problem solving. <ref>[http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2005/2005003.pdf International Outcomes of Learning in Mathematics Literacy and Problem Solving]. National Center for Education Statistics. Retrieved February 18, 2005. </ref> In the 2006 assessment, the U.S. ranked 35th out of 57 in mathematics and 29th out of 57 in science. Reading scores could not be reported due to printing errors in the instructions of the U.S. test booklets. U.S. <!--PISA---> scores were behind those of most other developed nations. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/30/17/39703267.pdf |title=PISA 2006 Science Competencies for Tomorrow’s World Volume 1: Analysis. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref> . 

However, the picture changes when low achievers in the U.S. are broken out by race. White and Asian students in the United States are generally among the best-performing pupils in the world; black 
and Hispanic students in the U.S. have very high rates of low achievement. <ref name="Trans-Atlantic Comparisons 2-2">{{cite news| url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,628389-2,00.html | publisher=Spiegel Online | title=Is the US Really a Nation of God-Fearing Darwin-Haters? | date=April 6, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.edexcellence.net/publications-issues/publications/american-achievement-in.html|publisher=Thomas B.

The rise of the high school movement in the beginning of the 20th century was unique in the United States, such that, high schools were implemented with property-tax funded tuition, openness, non-exclusivity, and were decentralized.  . 

The academic curriculum was designed to provide the students with a terminal degree. The students obtained general knowledge (such as mathematics, chemistry, English composition, etc.) applicable to the high geographic and social mobility in the United States. The provision of the high schools accelerated with the rise of the second industrial revolution. The increase in white collar and skilled blue-collar work in manufacturing was reflected in the demand for high school education.  . 

In the 21st century, the '''educational attainment''' of the US population is similar to that of many other industrialized countries with the vast majority of the population having completed secondary education and a rising number of college graduates that outnumber high school dropouts. As a whole, the population of the United States is becoming increasingly more educated.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Post-secondary education is valued very highly by American society and is one of the main determinants of [[American middle class|class]] and [[American middle class#Defining attributes|status]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  As with [[Household income in the United States|income]], however, there are significant discrepancies in terms of race, age, household configuration and geography. <ref name="US Census Bureau report on educational attainment in the United States, 2003" /> Overall the households and demographics featuring the highest educational attainment in the United States are also among those with the highest [[Household income in the United States|household income]] and [[Wealth in the United States|wealth]]. Thus, while the population of the US is becoming increasingly educated on all levels, a direct link between income and educational attainment remains. <ref name="US Census Bureau report on educational attainment in the United States, 2003" /> . 

In 2007, Americans stood second only to Canada in the percentage of 35 to 64 year olds holding at least two-year degrees. Among 25 to 34 year olds, the country stands tenth. The nation stands 15 out of 29 rated nations for college completion rates, slightly above Mexico and Turkey. <ref name="bfp081207"/> .

It involved lengthy interviews of over 26,700 adults statistically balanced for age, gender, ethnicity, education level, and location (urban, suburban, or rural) in 12 states across the U.S. and was designed to represent the U.S. population as a whole. This government study showed that 21% to 23% of adult Americans were not "able to locate information in text", could not "make low-level inferences using printed materials", and were unable to "integrate easily identifiable pieces of information."<ref name=nces93275 /> .
