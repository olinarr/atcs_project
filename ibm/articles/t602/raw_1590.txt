==Funding==. 
ALG is a nonprofit, [[501(c)3]] organization.  The nonpartisan [[Center for Public Integrity]] has reported that 99 percent of ALG's funding in 2005 came from three unnamed sources. <ref>http://www.publicintegrity.org/investigations/takings/articles/entry/69/ Center for Public Integrity, Three big donors bankrolled Americans for limited government for 2005, Dec 21 2006</ref>  ALG Chairman Howard Rich did not respond to the Center's request for financial information, and Rich also did not answer questions on how much money personally donated to the group.  This limited donor base contrasts with ALG's statement that the "grassroot volunteers and donors make up the soul and heart of our organization."<ref>http://www.getliberty.org/content.asp?pl=3&sl=4&contentid=4 ALG website, 25 Sept 2009</ref> . 

==Objectives==. 
===Property rights=== . 

As one of their primary issues, Americans for Limited Government advocates limiting the ability of government to exercise eminent domain: as defined by [[Kelo v. New London]].   . 

ALG has sought to do this by funding ballot initiatives throughout the country that would curtail the scope of [[eminent domain]].  In 2006 the group along with [[Fund for Democracy]] helped support ballot initiatives to limit the use of eminent domain in eight states contributing approximately $4 million dollars. <ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-09-24-domain_x.htm "Voters get a say on land rights" ''USA Today'' 9/24/2006]</ref> They were qualified for the 2006 ballots in [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Idaho]], [[Montana]], [[Nevada]], and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], but failed in [[Colorado]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Missouri]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[South Carolina]]. Another initiative might have been on the ballot in the [[Matanuska-Susitna Borough]] of [[Alaska]]. [[I-933]] in Washington state.  . 

Critics of ALG's property rights efforts have focused on two pragmatic areas: first, that the initiatives will make government incapable of regulating land use. <ref>[http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/washington/contact/art18708.html "Nature Conservancy Opposes I-933"]</ref> and second, that the initiativesn will cost tax payers billions of dollars as it requires compensating businesses for complying with existing laws. <ref>[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/286626_initiative27.html "Study puts I-933's cost in billions." ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'' 9/27/2006]</ref> . 

===Taxpayer Bill of Rights===. 
{{main|Taxpayer Bill of Rights}} . 

ALG also supports initiatives to enact Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TaBOR) laws, which require states annually to reduce or restrict [[revenue]] or spending to within limits set according to inflation and population growth. These laws provide for "rainy day" (emergency) funds as well as the ability for state voters to decide whether their representatives should spend revenue surpluses rather than have it refunded to the taxpayers. Colorado voters passed the best-known example of a TABOR law in 1992 and later voted to suspend its restrictions in the 2005 Colorado Economic Recovery Act]. <ref>http://www.leg.state.co.us/Clics2005a/csl.nsf/fsbillcont3/60F288DEECFCFFE287256F5E0078D116?Open&file=1194_ren.pdf</ref> . 

The 2006 TaBOR initiatives were referred to variously as Stop OverSpending (SOS) (in Nebraska), Taxpayer Bill of Rights (in Maine and Oklahoma) and the "Rainy Day Amendment" (in Oregon) consisting of ballot [[Oregon Ballot Measure 41 (2006)|Measure 41]] and [[Oregon Ballot Measure 48 (2006)|48]]. The [[Oklahoma Supreme Court]] threw out the TaBOR initiative in that state because it had too few signatures and "evidence supported substantial illegal participation of out-of-state circulators."<ref>[http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/deliverdocument.asp?citeid=448052 In re: Initiative Petition No. 379, 2006 OK 60]</ref> A subsequent opinion will be issued addressing the details. Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, and Ohio have also removed TABOR from the ballot; initiatives were on the ballot but voted down, in Maine and Oregon.  . 

===School Choice=== . 

ALG promotes a free-market approach to the American public school system based on [[school vouchers|vouchers]] or [[charter school]]s, arguing that competition among schools will increase both the quality and the economic efficiency of public education. <ref>[http://www.getliberty.org/campaigns/schoolchoice/index.php ALG on School Choice]</ref><ref>[http://post.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/hoxby/papers/hoxby_2.pdf Caroline Hoxby on  school choice and school competition]</ref> The organization claims that privatizing American schools will decrease education spending, promote accountability in school administration, and permit parents a greater degree of control over the schools their children attend.  Opponents claim that ever since [[Milton Friedman]] suggested the concept during the aftermath of [[Brown v. Board of Education]], vouchers have functioned to increase racial and economic discrimination in schools, beginning in the late 1950s with the appearance of [[segregation academies]]. <ref>[http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/default.aspx?oid=5493 PFAW opposition to vouchers]</ref>  Critics also contend that since approximately four out of five US private schools are religious, voucher and charter systems violate the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Constitution]]. <ref>[http://www.nea.org/vouchers/index.html NEA opposition to vouchers]</ref> . 

===Recall of Judges=== . 

A fourth issue of concern for ALG is accountability in the judicial system. <ref>[http://www.getliberty.org/campaigns/judicialreform/index.php ALG on Judicial Reform]</ref>  The group was involved in efforts to pass the Montana Constitutional Initiative 98 in 2006,<ref>http://sos.state.mt.us/ELB/archives/2006/CI/CI-98.asp| Constitutional Initiative 98</ref> which would have allowed voters in that state to recall elected judges or justices for any reason. At present, Montana provides for the recall of these officials only in cases of incapacity, incompetence, misconduct, or felony. The initiative, along with two others, was removed from the ballot due to fraudulent signature gathering techniques, by a unanimous decision of the [[Montana Supreme Court]]. <ref>[http://www.montanakaimin.com/index.php/news/news_article/ballot_initiatives_thrown_out/ montanakaimin.com - News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . 

==Accomplishments==. 
===The State Right to Vote Act===. 
The State right to vote act is a bill that was introduced to congress on March 11, 2011 by Rep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina. The Bill has garnered the support of 37other co-sponsors. The bill itself is aimed at amending the National Labor Relations act to
{{cquote|Declare that nothing in the Act shall be construed to authorize or recognize a labor organization as the representative of employees in a state where recognition of the labor organization is prohibited, unless the labor organization has been selected by a majority of such employees in a secret ballot…:<ref>[http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h1047/text "H.R.1047 - State Right to Vote Act?" 1/1/2012]</ref>}}
American’s for Limited Government has been at the forefront, supporting the bill through numerous op-eds, various social media outlets, and their blog NetRightDaily.  . 

===California===. 
A relatively unknown, at the time, Americans for Limited Government made their presence known in 2006, when they backed several ballot initiatives aimed at limiting the breadth of eminent domain.  
California's Proposition 90, which appeared on the November 2006 ballot, was a technical loss but was an accomplishment none the less. Prop. 90 was designed to limit the circumstances under which government agencies could use eminent domain to obtain property, increase the amount government pays when they use eminent domain, and require state and local governments to compensate property owners when changes in laws or regulations diminished the value of their property. <ref>[http://www.cbp.org/publications/documents/0609_bb_prop90_001.pdf "MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE: WHAT WOULD PROPOSITION 90 MEAN FOR CALIFORNIA?" ''California Budget Project'' 12/26/2011]</ref> The measure when put to the voters, failed to pass. 47.6% in favor 52.4% opposed. <ref>California Secretary of State [http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2006_general/contents.htm 2006 Election returns]</ref> Two years later a lesser In the June 2008 election the more narrowly defined Proposition 99 was passed. <ref>[[California Proposition 90 (2006)|"Wikipedia"]]</ref> . 

==Controversies== . 

ALG has been criticized for representing wealthy out-of-state interests under the guise of local grassroots activism. <ref>[http://www.pbs.org/now/shows/238/index.html "Taking the Initiative." ''Now'' 9/22/2006]</ref> However, in an interview in [[South Carolina]], a reporter asked ALG sponsor [[Howard Rich]] about his motivation behind out-of-state contributions; Rich said:
{{cquote|There is great satisfaction. I went to public schools. My wife did. My two sons did. Here's an opportunity to give back something where kids will have an opportunity and parents will have an opportunity to go to a school of their choice not some school mandated by government. If every proposal that I have favored over the last 20 years got enacted, whether its term limits or school choice or property rights or any area -- I get no personal benefit out of it. I don't make a nickel. Here in [[South Carolina]] I own no property. I have no businesses down here. So there's no real monetary benefit.}}&ndash;Howard Rich.  .
