|McKinney supports comprehensive federal investment in low-come families and communities, with an emphasis on people of color, to eliminate racial and other disparities in education, healthcare, imprisonment, family income, wealth, home ownership. She supports a moratorium on foreclosures, and end to the privatization of prisons. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita survivors should be recognized as Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs); she supports protecting their right of return, including their right to vote in their home states, and reparations for the losses they incurred due to government abandonment and negligence. She calls for an end to the "War on Drugs," which justifies foreign military intervention and assaults civil liberties; mandatory minimum drug sentences should be ended, and the budget should focus on treatment and prevention. <ref>[http://votetruth08.com/index.php/resources/campaignplatform Campaign Platform][http://www.opednews.com/articles/A-Gift-for-a-Generation--by-Cynthia-McKinney-080925-923.html A Gift for a Generation: A U.S. Financial System of Our Own]</ref>
