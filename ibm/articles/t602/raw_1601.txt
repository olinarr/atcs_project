'''The Foundation for Educational Choice''' is an [[Indianapolis]]-based [[non-profit]] organization dedicated to the issue of [[school choice]] and committed to assisting education reform efforts.  The Foundation was founded in 1996 by [[Nobel laureate]] [[Milton Friedman]] and his wife, economist [[Rose Friedman|Rose Director Friedman]], and was then known as the Milton & Rose D. Friedman Foundation. <ref>"School-choice charity fund aimed at the needy"  ''Toronto Star '' Feb 13, 2003t Page A.29  [http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/421050611.html?dids=421050611:421050611&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Feb+13%2C+2003&author=&pub=Toronto+Star&desc=School-choice+charity+fund+aimed+at+the+needy&pqatl=google link]</ref> .

== School Choice ==. 
In 1955 Milton Friedman put forth an idea of using [[free market]] principles to improve the [[Education in the United States|United States public school system]].  Currently, public schools are funded by state and local taxes and a child is assigned their school based on where that student lives.  Friedman pointed out that by distributing [[School voucher|vouchers]] to the families of students equal to the tuition that he/she would receive at his/her local public school, a student’s family could then choose from options where best to send their child.  . 

The Foundation, following Friedman’s view, is focused on the creation and growth of school choice programs either through vouchers or [[School choice#Tuition tax credits|tax-based incentive programs]]. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?ID=33913|title=Friedman Foundation Calls for Tax Credits to Benefit K-12 Education|date=February 10, 2009|work=Inside Indiana Business|accessdate=12 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-politics-elections/rally-to-unite-public-310078.html|title=Rally to unite public, private groups that back vouchers|last=Dodd  |first=D.
