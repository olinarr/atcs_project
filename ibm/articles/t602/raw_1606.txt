'''Michael Andrew Gove''', [[Member of Parliament|MP]] (born 26 August 1967) is a British politician, who currently serves as the [[Secretary of State for Education]] and as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Member of Parliament (MP) for the [[Surrey Heath (UK Parliament constituency)|Surrey Heath]] constituency. He is also a published author and former ''[[the Times|Times]]'' journalist and he remains friends with his erstwhile proprietor [[Rupert Murdoch]]. <ref> The Independent,  29 February 2012 ,p.12  Matthew Norman, ''Murdoch's malign effect on our police; let us never forget the stench of this rank corruption''. </ref> . 

Born in [[Edinburgh]], Gove was raised in [[Aberdeen]] and made an early career as a journalist. He was first elected to [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|parliament]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]], as the MP for the [[safe seat|safe]] Conservative seat of [[Surrey Heath (UK Parliament constituency)|Surrey Heath]] in [[South East England]]. He was first promoted to the [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|shadow cabinet]] in 2007 under [[David Cameron]], as the Shadow [[Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families]].  . 

After the formation of the [[United Kingdom coalition government (2010–present)|coalition government]] in 2010, Gove was appointed the [[Secretary of State for Education]].  . 

==Early life and career outside Parliament==. 
Gove was born in [[Edinburgh]]. At four months old, he was adopted by a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]-supporting family in [[Aberdeen]], where he was brought up. <ref name=SuppLab>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/7730573/Teenage-Michael-Gove-supported-Labour.html "Teenage Michael Gove supported Labour"] ''The Telegraph'', 16 May 2010</ref> His father ran a [[Fishing industry in Scotland|fish processing business]]; his mother was a [[lab assistant]] at the [[University of Aberdeen]] before working at the Aberdeen School for the Deaf. <ref name="michaelgove.com">[http://www.michaelgove.com/about About Rt Hon Michael Gove MP]</ref> . 

He was initially state school educated in Aberdeen, later attending the independent [[Robert Gordon's College]], to which he won a scholarship. <ref name=SuppLab/> From 1985 to 1988 he studied English at [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford]],<ref name="newsnightreview" /> where he served as [[President of the Oxford Union]].  . 

Gove was a trainee reporter at the ''[[Press and Journal]]'' in [[Aberdeen]], where he spent several months on strike in a dispute over union recognition and representation. <ref name="people.com">[http://www.people.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/2010/03/21/picture-emerges-of-tory-strike-basher-michael-gove-on-the-picket-line-during-his-own-walkout-93463-22127004/]</ref> He joined ''[[The Times]]'' in 1996 as a [[leader writer]] and has been its comment editor, news editor, Saturday editor and assistant editor. He has also written a weekly column on politics and current affairs for ''The Times'' and contributed to the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', ''[[Prospect magazine]]'' and ''[[The Spectator]]''. He has also written a sympathetic biography of [[Michael Portillo]] and a critical study of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], ''The Price of Peace'', for which he won the Charles Douglas-Home Prize. <ref name="newsnightreview">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/review/panel/2043945.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Michael Gove | date=22 April 2009 | accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref> Gove was instrumental in the launch of the new centre-right magazine ''[[Standpoint (magazine)|Standpoint]]'', and serves on its advisory board.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} . 

He has worked for the BBC's ''[[Today programme]]'', ''[[On The Record]]'', [[Scottish Television]] and the Channel 4 [[monologue]] programme ''[[A Stab in the Dark (TV series)|A Stab In The Dark]]'', alongside [[David Baddiel]] and [[Tracey MacLeod]], and was a regular panellist on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[The Moral Maze]]'' and ''[[Newsnight Review]]'' on [[BBC Two]]. <ref name="michaelgove.com"/> . 

Gove was a member of the winning team in [[Grampian Television]]'s quiz show ''[[Top Club]]'',{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} and played the school chaplain in the 1995 family comedy ''[[A Feast at Midnight]]''. <ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109784/fullcredits#cast A Feast at Midnight (1995) – Full cast and crew] IMDb</ref> . 

==Political career==. 
Gove joined the Conservative Party at university and was secretary of [[Aberdeen South (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberdeen South]] [[Young Conservatives]].{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} He has helped to write speeches for Cabinet and Shadow Cabinet ministers, including [[Peter Lilley]] and [[Michael Howard]].{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} When applying for a job at the [[Conservative Research Department]] he was told he was "insufficiently political" and "insufficiently Conservative", consequently he turned to journalism.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} . 

Gove was previously chairman of [[Policy Exchange]], a conservative [[think tank]] launched in 2002.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} . 

===Member of Parliament===. 
Gove entered [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]] as Conservative member for the safe seat of [[Surrey Heath]].{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} . 

On 2 July 2007, he was promoted to the [[Shadow Cabinet]] as [[Shadow Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families]] (a new department set up by the Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]]) shadowing [[Ed Balls]], a key supporter of Brown {{citation needed|date=September 2010}}. Prior to the 2010 general election, most of his questions in House of Commons debates concerned children, schools and families, education, local government, Council Tax, Foreign Affairs, and the environment. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/michael_gove/surrey_heath |title=Michael Gove MP, Surrey Heath |publisher=TheyWorkForYou|accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref> . 

In 2008, in an attempt to split the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], Gove suggested that senior Blairites who might become isolated should their party move to the left following a general election defeat, could be offered a role in a future Conservative government. <ref>Gaby Hinsliff [http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/sep/28/michaelgove.conservatives "Gove invites key Blairites to join a future Tory cabinet"] ''The Observer'', 28 September 2008</ref> . 

Gove is seen as part of an influential set of young up-and-coming Tories, sometimes referred to as the '[[Notting Hill Set]]', which includes [[David Cameron]], [[George Osborne]], [[Edward Vaizey]], [[Nicholas Boles]] and [[Rachel Whetstone]].{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} They are perceived as modernisers on social issues, and humanitarian interventionists in foreign policy. When Cameron was elected leader in December 2005, he appointed Gove the housing spokesman shadowing the [[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]].{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} Michael Portillo predicted that Gove will one day lead the Conservative party.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} . 

====Secretary of State for Education====. 
Gove is the current Secretary of State for Education. Following his appointment in May 2010, he rebranded his department,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8679749.stm "Department for Education returns in coalition rebrand"] BBC News, 13 May 2010</ref> announced plans to convert schools rated as 'outstanding' by [[Ofsted]] into [[Academy (English school)|academies]],<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/10159448.stm "Schools are promised an academies 'revolution'"] BBC News, 26 May 2010</ref> and cut the previous Government's school building programme. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/10514113.stm "School buildings scheme scrapped"] BBC News, 5 July 2010</ref> He was forced to apologise, however, when the list of terminated school building projects he had released was found to be inaccurate. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/10538754.stm "Gove apologizes over school building list errors"] BBC News, 7 July 2010</ref> . 

In July 2010, Gove said that Labour had failed in its attempt to break the link between social class and school achievement despite spending billions of pounds. Quoting research, he indicated that by the age of 6, children of low ability from affluent homes were still out-performing brighter children from poor backgrounds. In a Commons [[Education Select Committee]] he said that this separation of achievement grew larger throughout pupils' school careers, stating, "In effect, rich thick kids do better than poor clever children when they arrive at school [and] the situation as they go through gets worse,". <ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/7914719/Rich-thick-kids-do-better-at-school-says-Gove.html "'Rich thick kids' do better at school, says Gove"] ''The Telegraph'', 28 July 2010</ref> . 

During the 2010 Conservative Party Conference, Gove announced that school curriculum would be restructured, and that study of authors such as [[Byron]], [[Keats]], [[Jane Austen]], [[Dickens]] and [[Thomas Hardy]] would be reintroduced to English lessons as part of a plan to improve children’s grasp of English literature and language. Children who fail to write coherently and grammatically, and who are weak in spelling, would be penalised under new examinations. Historian [[Simon Schama]] would give advice to government to ensure that pupils learnt Britain’s "island story". Standards in mathematics and science would also be strengthened. He explained that this was needed because left-wing ideologues had undermined education. Theirs was the view, he thought, that schools "shouldn’t be doing anything so old-fashioned as passing on knowledge, requiring children to work hard, or immersing them in anything like dates in history or times tables in mathematics. These ideologues may have been inspired by generous ideals but the result of their approach has been countless children condemned to a prison house of ignorance."<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8043872/Conservative-Part-Conference-schoolchildren-ignorant-of-the-past-says-Gove.html "Conservative Part Conference: schoolchildren 'ignorant of the past', says Gove"] ''The Telegraph'' 5 October 2010. Retrieved 12 May 2011</ref> . 

In a November 2010 [[White paper]], Gove declared reforms would include the compulsory study of foreign languages up to the age of 16, and a shake-up of league tables in which schools are ranked higher for the number of pupils taking GCSEs in five core subjects: English; mathematics; science; a language; and one of the humanities. He also announced that experts such as historian [[Simon Schama]] will be brought in to review the curriculum, and that targets are to be introduced for primary schools for the first time. Additionally, trainee teachers will spend more time in the classroom, there would be more assessment of teacher training applicants—including tests of character and emotional intelligence—and former troops will be offered sponsorship to retrain as teachers to improve discipline. Teachers are also expected to receive guidance on how to search pupils for more items, including mobile phones and pornography, and when they can use force. <ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8155995/Education-White-Paper-key-points.html Education White Paper: Key points] ''The Telegraph'' 24 November 2010. Retrieved 12 May 2011</ref> . 

In December 2010, in an article in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', he claimed that "Like [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao]], we’ve embarked on a Long March to reform our education system", apparently unaware that Mao's [[cultural revolution]] closed China's education system for ten years and led to the deaths of many teachers. <ref>www.ibe.unesco.org/publications/ThinkersPdf/maoe.pdf</ref>

Retrieved 12 May 2011</ref> . 

In February 2011 a [[Judicial Review]] deemed his decision to axe [[Building Schools for the Future]] (BSF) projects in six local authority areas was unlawful as he had failed to consult before imposing the cuts. <ref name=JR>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-12429152|title=Councils defeat government over school buildings|publisher=BBC News |author=Hannah Richardson|date=11 February 2011|accessdate=11 February 2011}}</ref>  The judge also said that in five of the cases, the failure was "so unfair as to amount to an abuse of power" and that "however pressing the economic problems, there was no overriding public interest which precluded consultation or justifies the lack of any consultation". <ref name=JR/>  The Government will have to reconsider but it said it had won the case on substantial issues. <ref name=JR/> . 

In March 2011 Gove was criticised for not understanding the importance of school architecture and having previously misrepresented the cost. <ref name=guard>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2011/mar/06/michael-gove-architecture-in-schools|author=Rowan Moore|title=Architects do matter, Mr Gove|date=6 March 2011|publisher=Observer newspapers|accessdate=6 March 2011}}</ref> In February 2011, he gave "not-quite-true information to Parliament" by saying that one individual made £1m in one year when the true figure was £700k for 5 advisers at different times over a 4 year period. <ref name=guard/>
He told a Free Schools conference that 'no one in this room is here to make architects richer' and specifically mentioned architect [[Richard Rogers]]. <ref>[http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/daily-news/gove-richard-rogers-wont-design-your-school/8610768.article "Gove: Richard Rogers won’t design your school"] ''The Architects' Journal'' 2 February 2011. Retrieved 12 May 2011</ref> . 

In April 2011 Gove criticised schools for not studying pre-20th century classics and blamed “England’s constricted and unreformed exam system” for failing to encourage children to read. Gove also blamed an “anti knowledge culture” for reducing achievement and said children benefited when expectations were set higher. <ref name=mocking>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8419770/Michael-Gove-schools-failing-to-promote-the-classics.html# |title=Michael Gove: schools failing to promote the classics|work=The Sunday Telegraph|author=Graeme Paton|date=3 April 2011|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref>
In June 2011 his "ignorance of science" was criticised after he called for students to have "a rooting in the basic scientific principles" and by way of example assigned [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin's]] [[laws of thermodynamics]] to [[Sir Isaac Newton]]. <ref>{{citenews|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tomchiversscience/100093493/would-you-have-confused-shakespeare-and-dickens-michael-gove/|author=Tom Chivers|title=Would you have confused Shakespeare and Dickens, Michael Gove? |publisher=daily telegraph|date=23-June-2011|accessdate=14-January-2012}}</ref> . 

=== Expenses claims ===. 
{{Main|Disclosure of expenses of British Members of Parliament}}
Michael Gove reportedly claimed £7,000 for furnishing a London property before 'flipping' his designated second home to a house in his constituency, a property for which he claimed around £13,000 to cover stamp duty. Around a third of the first £7,000 was spent at an interior design company owned by Gove's mother-in-law. <ref name=telegraph>{{cite news|last=Hope |first=Christopher |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5305434/Michael-Gove-flipped-homes-MPs-expenses.html |title=Michael Gove 'flipped' homes: MPs' expenses |work=The Telegraph|accessdate=13 May 2009| date=11 May 2009}}</ref> Gove also claimed for a cot mattress, despite children's items being banned under the Commons rule. Gove said he would repay the claim for the cot mattress, but maintained that his other claims were "below the acceptable threshold costs for furniture" and that the property flipping was necessary "to effectively discharge my parliamentary duties". <ref name=telegraph/> While he was moving between homes, he stayed at the Pennyhill Park Hotel and Spa, charging the taxpayer more than £500 per night's stay. <ref name=telegraph/> . 

== Political views == . 

===Unionism=== . 

Michael Gove is a Scot who believes that Scotland should remain part of the United Kingdom because Scotland's strengths complement those of other parts of the UK. <ref>[http://news.scotsman.com/opinion/Michael-Gove-Iceland-has-shown.4583419.jp "Michael Gove: Iceland has shown up Salmond as a Darien dreamer"] ''The Scotsman'', 12 October 2008</ref> . 

=== Liberty ===. 
Gove has expressed views that the state should not generally interfere in domestic affairs. He purported to campaign for personal freedom in certain matters, opposing the introduction of ID cards under the [[Identity Cards Act 2006]], and wrote that "[[Section 28]] is a nonsense", a reference to an enactment that prevented local authorities from providing funding for the positive portrayal of homosexuality, indicating a willingness to permit the expansion of the role of the state. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,1055-730993,00.html |work=The Times |location=UK | title=When the straight and narrow is the wrong path | date=1 July 2003 | accessdate=5 April 2010 | first=MIchael | last=Gove }}</ref> He shared a flat with Conservative [[Ivan Massow]] who later defected to Labour over Section 28 and [[Nicholas Boles]], and said "The only sustainable ethical foundation for society is a belief in the innate worth and dignity of every individual."<ref name="independent.co.uk">{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/michael-gove-the-modest-moderniser-944074.html | work=The Independent | title=Michael Gove: The modest moderniser | first=Andy | last=McSmith | date=27 September 2008 | accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref> . 

=== Education ===. 
As Shadow Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, he advocated the introduction of a Swedish-style voucher system, whereby parents can choose where their child should be educated, with the state paying what they would have cost in a state-school. He has also advocated Swedish style [[Free school (England)|"free schools"]], to be managed by parents and funded by the state. <ref>{{cite news|author=Jessica Shepherd |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/mar/07/conservatives-lure-private-schools-state |title=Conservatives aim to lure private schools into state system |work=The Guardian|date= 7 March 2010|accessdate=8 May 2010 | location=London}}</ref> . 

=== Foreign policy ===. 
Considered by some to be a British [[neo-conservative]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/apr/25/michael-gove-interview|title='We are carrying forward the Blair agenda'|work=The Guardian|date=25 April 2009|accessdate=6 March 2010 | first=Nicholas | last=Watt | location=London}}</ref>  he called for early intervention against [[Saddam Hussein]] and stated in October 2004 of [[Tony Blair]]: "I can't hold it back any more; I love Tony!" He is a signatory of the [[Henry Jackson Society]], which advocates an active approach to the spread of democracy, and an adviser to the [[The Atlantic Bridge|Atlantic Bridge]], which works to affirm the Transatlantic alliance.  . 

He was a proponent of the view that the invasion of Iraq would bring peace and democracy both to Iraq and the wider Middle East. In December 2008 Gove wrote that declarations of either victory or defeat in Iraq in 2003 were premature, and with the benefit of hindsight "The [[liberation of Iraq]] has actually been that rarest of things – a proper British foreign policy success. Next year, while the world goes into recession, Iraq is likely to enjoy 10% GDP growth. Alone in the Arab Middle East, it is now a fully functioning democracy with a free press, properly contested elections and an independent judiciary ... Sunni and Shia contend for power in parliament, not in street battles. The ingenuity, idealism and intelligence of the Iraqi people can now find an outlet in a free society rather than being deployed, as they were for decades, simply to ensure survival in a fascist republic that stank of fear.

He has been accused of harbouring hostile attitude towards Islam and Muslims after his book ''[[Celsius 7/7]]'',<ref>{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article645300.ece |work=The Times |location=UK | title=A global crisis of understanding | date=24 September 2006 | accessdate=5 April 2010 | first=William | last=Dalrymple }}</ref> despite distinguishing between 'the great historical faith' of Islam which he claims has 'brought spiritual nourishment to millions', and Islamism, a 'totalitarian ideolog[y]' which turns to 'hellish violence and oppression' like the 20th century ideologies of [[National Socialism]] and Communism. <ref>Michael Gove, Celsius 7/7 2006 pvii</ref> . 

<!--This seems trivial and possibly peacock text-->He has mourned the [[First World War]] as a great tragedy, in which not only did millions die, but the old, largely liberal, tolerant and materially progressive order perished. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/michael_gove/article5067844.ece |work=The Times |location=UK |title=Collapse of the pre1914 world is still felt | date=3 November 2008 | accessdate=5 April 2010 | first=Michael | last=Gove }}</ref> . 

=== Political philosophy ===. 
During the 2008 Conservative Party Conference, he argued that [[Edmund Burke]] (a philosopher who commented on [[organic society]] and the [[French Revolution]]) was the greatest [[conservative]] ever.  . 

Asked about those who believe 'Marx was right all along', he argued that Marxists were guilty of ignoring the systematic abuses and poverty of centrally planned economies, and criticised [[Eric Hobsbawm]], saying that "only when Hobsbawm weeps hot tears for a life spent serving an ideology of wickedness will he ever be worth listening to."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/michael_gove/article5019248.ece |work=The Times |location=UK |title=When you're in a hole, don't dig any new ones | date=27 October 2008 | accessdate=5 April 2010 | first=Michael | last=Gove }}</ref> . 

===Haves and have yachts===. 
In January 2012, Mr Gove's ideas for a new [[Royal Yacht]] costing £60m were made public<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/17/world/europe/education-minister-suggests-a-yacht-for-queen-elizabeth-ii.html</ref>.
