Sweden emerged as an independent and unified country during the [[Middle Ages]]. In the 17th century, the country expanded its territories to form the [[Swedish Empire]]. The empire grew to be one of the [[great power]]s of Europe in the 17th and early 18th century. Most of the conquered territories outside the Scandinavian Peninsula were lost during the 18th and 19th centuries. The eastern half of Sweden, present-day Finland, was lost to [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in 1809. The last war in which Sweden was directly involved was in 1814, when Sweden by military means forced Norway into a [[Union of Sweden and Norway|personal union]]. Since then, Sweden has been at peace, adopting a non-aligned foreign policy in peacetime and [[neutral country|neutrality]] in wartime. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2880.htm#foreign |title='&#39;U.S. State Department Background Notes: Sweden'&#39; |publisher=State.gov |date=2010-03-22 |accessdate=2010-08-25}}</ref> . 

Today, Sweden is a [[constitutional monarchy]] with a [[parliamentary democracy]] of government and a highly developed economy. In 2010, it ranked fourth in the world in ''[[The Economist]]'''s [[Democracy Index]] and ninth in the [[United Nations]]' [[Human Development Index]]. In 2010, the [[World Economic Forum]] ranked Sweden as the second most competitive country in the world, after Switzerland. <ref>Klaus Schwab [http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GlobalCompetitivenessReport_2010-11.pdf The Global Competitiveness Report 2010–2011]. World Economic Forum, Geneva, Switzerland 2010 ISBN 92-95044-87-8</ref> According to the [[United Nations|UN]], it has the third lowest [[infant mortality]] rate in the world. Sweden also has the lowest [[Gini coefficient]] of all countries (0.23) which makes Sweden the most equal country on earth in terms of economic division. Sweden has been a member of the European Union since 1 January 1995 and is a member of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]].  . 

==Etymology==. 
{{Main|Name of Sweden}}
The modern name ''Sweden'' is derived through [[back-formation]] from Old English ''Swēoþēod'', which meant "people of the Swedes" (Old Norse ''Svíþjóð'', Latin ''Suetidi''). This word is derived from ''Sweon/Sweonas'' (Old Norse ''Sviar'', Latin S''uiones''). The Swedish name ''Sverige'' (a conjunction of the words ''Svea'' and ''Rike'', first recorded as ''Swēorice'' in [[Beowulf]], with the consonant 'k' softened to 'g'<ref>{{cite book |last=Hellquist |first=Elof |title=Svensk etymologisk ordbok |year=1922 |publisher=Gleerups förlag |location=Stockholm |page=917|url=http://runeberg.org/svetym/1005.html}}</ref>&nbsp;– compare "rige" in modern [[Danish language|Danish]]) literally means "Kingdom of the [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedes]]", excluding the [[Geat]]s in [[Götaland]].  . 

Variations of the name ''Sweden'' are used in most languages, with the exception of Danish and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] using ''Sverige'', [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''Svíþjóð'', and the more notable exception of some [[Finno-Ugric languages]] where ''Ruotsi'' ([[Finnish language|Finnish]]) and ''Rootsi'' ([[Estonian language|Estonian]]) are used, names commonly considered etymologically related to the English name for Russia, referring to the people, ''[[Rus (people)|Rus']]'', originally from the coastal areas of [[Roslagen]], [[Uppland]].  . 

The etymology of ''Swedes'', and thus ''Sweden'', is generally not agreed upon but may derive from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''Swihoniz'' meaning "one's own",<ref>{{cite book |last=Hellquist |first=Elof |title=Svensk etymologisk ordbok |year=1922 |publisher=Gleerups förlag |location=Stockholm |page=915}}</ref> referring to one's own Germanic tribe.  . 

==History==. 
{{Main|History of Sweden}} . 

===Prehistory===. 
{{Main|Prehistoric Sweden}}
Sweden's prehistory begins in the [[Allerød Oscillation|Allerød warm period]] c. 12,000 BC with Late [[Palaeolithic]] [[reindeer]]-hunting camps of the [[Bromme culture]] at the edge of the ice in what is now the country's southernmost province. This period was characterized by small bands of [[Hunter-gatherer|hunter-gatherer-fishers]] using [[flint]] technology.  . 

Sweden enters proto-history with the ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' of [[Tacitus]] in AD 98. In [[s:Germania#XLIV|Germania 44, 45]] he mentions the Swedes (''[[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Suiones]]'') as a powerful tribe (''distinguished not merely for their arms and men, but for their powerful fleets'') with ships that had a [[prow]] in both ends ([[longship]]s). Which kings (''kuningaz'') ruled these Suiones is unknown, but [[Norse mythology]] presents a long line of legendary and semi-legendary kings going back to the last centuries BC. As for literacy in Sweden itself, the [[runic alphabet|runic script]] was in use among the south Scandinavian elite by at least the 2nd century AD, but all that has come down to the present from the Roman Period is curt inscriptions on artefacts, mainly of male names, demonstrating that the people of south Scandinavia spoke [[Proto-Norse]] at the time, a language ancestral to Swedish and other [[North Germanic languages]].  . 

In the 6th century [[Jordanes]] named two tribes he calls the ''Suehans'' and the ''Suetidi'' who lived in [[Scandza]]. These two names are both considered to refer to the same tribe. The ''Suehans'', he says, has very fine horses just as the "Thyringi" tribe (''alia vero gens ibi moratur Suehans, quae velud Thyringi equis utuntur eximiis''). [[Snorri Sturluson]] wrote that the contemporary Swedish king [[Adils]] (Eadgils) had the finest horses of his days. The Suehans were the suppliers of black fox skins for the Roman market. Then Jordanes names the ''Suetidi'' which is considered to be the Latin form of ''[[Svitjod]]''. He writes that the Suetidi are the tallest of men together with the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Dani]] who were of the same stock. Later he mentions other Scandinavian tribes for being of the same height.  . 

Originating in semi-legendary Scandza, believed to be somewhere in modern [[Götaland]], Sweden, a [[Goths|Gothic]] population had crossed the [[Baltic Sea]] before the 2nd century AD, reaching [[Scythia]] at the coast of the [[Black Sea]] in modern [[Ukraine]] where Goths left their archaeological traces in the [[Chernyakhov culture]]. In the 5th and 6th centuries, they became divided as the [[Visigoths]] and the [[Ostrogoths]], and established powerful successor-states of the [[Roman Empire]] in the [[Iberian peninsula]] and Italy. <ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/239637/Goth Goth (people)]. Britannica Online Encyclopedia. </ref> [[Crimean Gothic]] communities appear to have survived intact in [[Crimea]] until the late 18th century. <ref>Ingemar Nordgren (2004). "''[http://books.google.com/books?id=-wZYqf3G45cC&pg=PA520 The Well Spring of the Goths: About the Gothic Peoples in the Nordic Countries and on the Continent]''". iUniverse. p. 520 ISBN 0595336485</ref> . 

===Viking and Middle Ages===. 
{{See also|Early Swedish history|Foundation of Modern Sweden|Varangians}}
The Swedish [[Viking Age]] lasted roughly between the 8th and 11th centuries. It is believed that Swedish Vikings and [[Gutar]] mainly travelled east and south, going to Finland, the Baltic countries, Russia, [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]] the [[Black Sea]] and further as far as [[Baghdad]]. Their routes passed [[The Trade Route from the Varangians to the Greeks|through the Dnieper]] down south to [[Constantinople]], on which they did numerous raids. The [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] noticed their great skills in war and invited them to serve as his personal bodyguard, known as the [[varangian guard]]. The Swedish Vikings, called "[[Rus (people)|Rus]]" are also believed to be the founding fathers of [[Kievan Rus]]. The Arabic traveller "[[Ibn Fadlan]]" described these Vikings as following:  . 

{{quote|''I have seen the Rus as they came on their merchant journeys and encamped by the [[Volga|Itil]]. I have never seen more perfect physical specimens, tall as date palms, blond and ruddy; they wear neither tunics nor caftans, but the men wear a garment which covers one side of the body and leaves a hand free. Each man has an axe, a sword, and a knife, and keeps each by him at all times. The swords are broad and grooved, of Frankish sort.''<ref>Quoted from: Gwyn Jones. ''A History of the Vikings''. Oxford University Press, 2001. ISBN 0-19-280134-1. Page 164. </ref>}}  . 

The adventures of these Swedish Vikings are commemorated on many [[runestone]]s in Sweden, such as the [[Greece Runestones]] and the [[Varangian Runestones]]. There was also considerable participation in expeditions westwards, which are commemorated on stones such as the [[England Runestones]]. The last major Swedish Viking expedition appears to have been the ill-fated expedition of [[Ingvar the Far-Travelled]] to [[Serkland]], the region south-east of the [[Caspian Sea]]. Its members are commemorated on the [[Ingvar Runestones]], none of which mentions any survivor. What happened to the crew is unknown, but it is believed that they died of sickness.  . 

;The Kingdom of Sweden
It is not known when and how the kingdom of Sweden was born, but the [[list of Swedish monarchs]] is drawn from the first kings known to have ruled both [[Svealand]] (Sweden) and [[Götaland]] (Gothia) as one province, beginning with [[Erik Segersäll|Erik the Victorious]]. Sweden and Gothia were two separate nations long before that into antiquity. It is not known how long they existed, ''[[Beowulf]]'' described semi-legendary [[Swedish-Geatish wars]] in the 6th century.  . 

[[File:Suecia Gambla Ubsala högar.png|thumb|220px|[[Gamla Uppsala]], a site of religious and political importance in the early days of Sweden.]]
;Cultural advances
During the early stages of the Scandinavian Viking Age, [[Ystad]] in [[Scania]] and [[Paviken]] on [[Gotland]], in present-day Sweden, were flourishing trade centres. Remains of what is believed to have been a large market have been found in Ystad dating from 600–700 AD. <ref name="Sawyer" /> In Paviken, an important centre of trade in the Baltic region during the 9th and 10th century, remains have been found of a large Viking Age harbour with shipbuilding yards and handicraft industries. Between 800 and 1000, trade brought an abundance of silver to Gotland, and according to some scholars, the Gotlanders of this era hoarded more silver than the rest of the population of Scandinavia combined. <ref name="Sawyer">Sawyer, Birgit and Peter Sawyer (1993). ''Medieval Scandinavia: from Conversion to Reformation, Circa 800–1500''. University of Minnesota Press, 1993. ISBN 0-8166-1739-2, pp. 150–153. </ref> . 

[[St. Ansgar]] is usually credited for introducing [[Christianity]] in 829, but the new religion did not begin to fully replace [[paganism]] until the 12th century. During the 11th century, Christianity became the most prevalent religion, and from 1050 Sweden is counted as a Christian nation. The period between 1100 and 1400 was characterized by internal power struggles and competition among the Nordic kingdoms. Swedish kings also began to expand the Swedish-controlled territory in Finland, creating conflicts with the Rus who no longer had any connection with Sweden. <ref>Bagge, Sverre (2005) "The Scandinavian Kingdoms". In ''The New Cambridge Medieval History''. Eds. Rosamond McKitterick et al. Cambridge University Press, 2005. ISBN 0-521-36289-X, p. 724: "Swedish expansion in Finland led to conflicts with [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']], which were temporarily brought to an end by a peace treaty in 1323, dividing the Karelian peninsula and the northern areas between the two countries."</ref> . 

;Feudal institutions in Sweden
Except for the province of [[Skane]], on the southernmost tip of Sweden which was under Danish control during this time, [[feudalism]] never developed in Sweden as it did in the rest of Europe. <ref>Franklin D. Scott, ''Sweden: The Nation's History'' (University of Minnesota Press: Minneapolis, 1977) p. 58. </ref> Therefore, the peasantry remained largely a class of free farmers throughout most of Swedish history. [[Slavery]] (also called [[thrall]]dom) was not common in Sweden,<ref>[http://runeberg.org/nfcj/0106.html Träldom]. Nordisk familjebok / Uggleupplagan. 30. Tromsdalstind – Urakami /159–160, 1920. (In Swedish)</ref> and what slavery there was tended to be driven out of existence by the spread of Christianity, the difficulty in obtaining slaves from the lands east of the Baltic Sea, and by the development of cities before the 16th century<ref>Scott, p. 55. </ref> Indeed, both slavery and [[serfdom]] were abolished altogether by a decree of King Magnus Erickson in 1335. Former slaves tended to be absorbed into the peasantry and some became labourers in the towns. Still, Sweden remained a poor and economically backward country in which barter was the means of exchange. For instance, the farmers of the province of [[Dalsland]] would transport their butter to the mining districts of Sweden and exchange it there for iron, which they would then take down to the coast and trade the iron for fish they needed for food while the iron would be shipped abroad. <ref>Scott, pp. 55–56. </ref> . 

[[File:Valdemar Atterdag brandskattar Visby (1882).jpg|miniatyr|198px|right|thumb|[[Valdemar IV]] takes control over Swedish [[Gotland]]. The final fight outside the walls of Visby ended with a total massacre of 1,800 Gotlanders.]]
;The Plague in Sweden
In the 14th century, Sweden was struck by the [[Black Death]]. The population of Sweden was decimated. <ref>Scott, pp. 56–57. </ref> During this period the Swedish cities also began to acquire greater rights and were strongly influenced by German merchants of the [[Hanseatic League]], active especially at [[Visby]]. In 1319, Sweden and Norway were united under King [[Magnus IV of Sweden|Magnus Eriksson]], and in 1397 Queen [[Margaret I of Denmark]] effected the personal union of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark through the [[Kalmar Union]]. However, Margaret's successors, whose rule was also centred in Denmark, were unable to control the Swedish nobility. 
;Minors and Regents
A large number of children inherited the Swedish crown over the course of the kingdom's existence, consequently{{mdash
}}real power was held for long periods by regents (notably those of the [[Sture]] family) chosen by the Swedish parliament. King [[Christian II of Denmark]], who asserted his claim to Sweden by force of arms, ordered a massacre in 1520 of Swedish nobles at Stockholm. This came to be known as the "[[Stockholm blood bath]]" and stirred the Swedish nobility to new resistance and, on 6 June (now Sweden's national holiday) in 1523, they made [[Gustav Vasa]] their king. <ref>Scott, p. 121. </ref> This is sometimes considered as the [[foundation of modern Sweden]]. Shortly afterwards he rejected [[Catholicism]] and led Sweden into the [[Protestant Reformation]]. Economically, Gustav Vasa broke the monopoly of the Hanseatic League over Swedish Baltic Sea trade. <ref>Scott, p. 132. </ref> . 

The Hanseatic League had been officially formed at [[Lübeck]] on [[Baltic Sea|the sea coast]] of [[Holy Roman Empire|Northern Germany]] in 1356. The Hanseatic League sought civil and [[commerce|commercial]] privileges from the princes and royalty of the countries and cities along the coasts of the Baltic Sea. <ref>Robert S. Hoyt & Stanley Chodorow, ''Europe in the Middle Ages'' (Harcourt, Brace & Jovanovich, Inc.: New York, 1976) p. 628. </ref> In exchange they offered a certain amount of protection. Having their own navy the Hansa were able to sweep the Baltic Sea free of pirates. <ref>John B. Wolfe, ''The Emergence of European Civilization'' (Harper & Row Pub.: New York, 1962) pp. 50–51. </ref> The privileges obtained by the Hansa included assurances that only Hansa citizens would be allowed to trade from the ports where they were located. They also sought agreement to be free of all customs and taxes. With these concessions, Lübeck merchants flocked to Stockholm, Sweden and soon came to dominate the economic life of that city and made the port city of Stockholm into the leading commercial and industrial city of Sweden. <ref>Scott, p. 52. </ref> Under the Hanseatic trade 2/3rds of Stockholm's imports consisted of textiles and 1/3 of salt. Exports from Sweden consisted of iron and copper. <ref>Scott</ref> . 

However, the Swedes began to resent the monopoly trading position of the Hansa (mostly German citizens) and to resent the income they felt they lost to the Hansa. Consequently, when Gustav Vasa or [[Gustav I]] broke the monopoly power of the Hanseatic League he was regarded as a hero to the Swedish people. History now views Gustav I as the father of the modern Swedish nation. The foundations laid by Gustav would take time to develop. Furthermore, when Sweden did develop, freed itself from the Hanseatic League and entered its golden era, the fact the peasantry had traditionally been free meant that more of the economic benefits flowed back to them rather than going to a feudal landowning class. <ref>Scott, pp. 156–157. </ref> This was not the case in other countries of Europe like Poland where the peasantry was still bound by serfdom and a strong feudalistic land owning system.  . 

===Swedish Empire===. 
[[File:Swedish Empire in Early Modern Europe (1560-1815).png|thumb|upright|The [[Swedish Empire]] between 1560 and 1815]] . 

{{See also|History of Sweden (1611–1648)|Swedish Empire|Swedish overseas colonies|Sweden and the Great Northern War|Absolute Monarchy in Sweden|Sweden-Finland|Union between Sweden and Norway}} . 

During the 17th century Sweden emerged as a European [[Great Power|great power]]. Before the emergence of the Swedish Empire, Sweden was a very poor and scarcely populated country on the fringe of European civilization, with no significant power or reputation. Sweden rose to prominence on a continental scale during the tenure of king [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]], seizing territories from Russia and [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland–Lithuania]] in multiple conflicts, including the [[Thirty Years' War]].  . 

During the Thirty Years' War, Sweden conquered approximately half of the Holy Roman states. Gustav Adolphus planned to become the new [[Holy Roman Emperor]], ruling over a united Scandinavia and the Holy Roman states, but he died at the [[Battle of Lützen (1632)|Battle of Lützen]] in 1632. After the [[Battle of Nördlingen (1634)|Battle of Nördlingen]], Sweden's only significant military defeat of the war, pro-Swedish sentiment among the German states faded. These German provinces excluded themselves from Swedish power one by one, leaving Sweden with only a few northern German territories: [[Swedish Pomerania]], [[Bremen-Verden]] and [[Wismar]]. The Swedish armies may have destroyed up to 2,000 castles, 18,000 villages and 1,500 towns in [[Early Modern history of Germany|Germany]], one-third of all German towns. <ref name="Population-HLS">{{cite web

In the middle of the 17th century Sweden was the third largest country in Europe by land area, only surpassed by Russia and Spain. Sweden reached its largest territorial extent under the rule of [[Charles X of Sweden|Charles X]] after the [[treaty of Roskilde]] in 1658. <ref name="HayesPSH">

The Swedes conducted a series of invasions into the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], known as the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]]. After more than half a century of almost constant warfare, the Swedish economy had deteriorated. It became the lifetime task of Charles' son, [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]], to rebuild the economy and refit the army. His legacy to his son, the coming ruler of Sweden [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]], was one of the finest arsenals in the world, a large standing army and a great fleet. Sweden's largest threat at this time, Russia, had a larger army but was far behind in both equipment and training.  . 

[[File:Battle of Lutzen.jpg|180px|thumb|Death of [[Gustav II Adolf]] at the [[Battle of Lützen (1632)|Battle of Lützen]]]]
After the [[Battle of Narva (1700)|Battle of Narva]] in 1700, one of the first battles of the [[Great Northern War]], the Russian army was so severely decimated that Sweden had an open chance to invade Russia. However, Charles did not pursue the Russian army, instead turning against Poland-Lithuania and defeating the Polish king [[Augustus II]] and his Saxon allies at the [[Battle of Kliszow]] in 1702. This gave Russia time to rebuild and modernize its army.  . 

After the success of invading Poland, Charles decided to make an invasion attempt of Russia which ended in a decisive Russian victory at the [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709. After a long march exposed to [[Cossack]] raids, Russian Tsar [[Peter the Great]]'s [[scorched-earth]] techniques and the [[Russian Winter|cold Russian climate]], the Swedes stood weakened with a shattered morale and enormously outnumbered against the Russian army at Poltava. The defeat meant the beginning of the end for the Swedish Empire.  . 

[[File:Marten's Poltava.jpg|thumb|180px|left|The [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709. In the years following Poltava, Russia occupied all the Swedish annexations on the Baltic coast and even Finland.]]
Charles XII attempted to invade Norway 1716; however, he was shot dead at [[Fredriksten| Fredriksten fortress]] in 1718. The Swedes were not militarily defeated at Fredriksten, but the whole structure and organization of the Norwegian campaign fell apart with the king's death, and the army withdrew.  . 

Forced to cede large areas of land in the [[Treaty of Nystad]] in 1721, Sweden also lost its place as an empire and as the dominant state on the Baltic Sea. With Sweden's lost influence, Russia emerged as an empire and became one of Europe's dominant nations. As the war finally ended in 1721, Sweden had lost an estimated 200,000 men, 150,000 of those from the area of present-day Sweden and 50,000 from the [[History of Finland#The 17th century – the Swedish Empire|Finnish]] part of Sweden. <ref>''[http://www.algonet.se/~hogman/slsoldat.htm#Mobilisering Losses statistics at Militaria].'' (Swedish)</ref> . 

In the 18th century, Sweden did not have enough resources to maintain its territories outside Scandinavia, and most of them were lost, culminating with the 1809 loss of eastern Sweden to Russia which became the highly autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Grand Principality of Finland]] in [[Imperial Russia]].  . 

In interest of re-establishing Swedish dominance in the Baltic Sea, Sweden allied itself against its traditional ally and benefactor, France, in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Sweden's role in the [[Battle of Leipzig]] gave it the authority to force Denmark-Norway, an ally of France, to cede Norway to the King of Sweden on 14 January 1814 in exchange for northern German provinces, at the [[Treaty of Kiel]]. The Norwegian attempts to keep their status as a sovereign state were rejected by the Swedish king, [[Charles XIII]]. He launched a military campaign against Norway on 27 July 1814, ending in the [[Convention of Moss]], which forced Norway into a [[Union between Sweden and Norway|personal union]] with Sweden under the Swedish crown, which lasted until 1905. The 1814 campaign was the last war in which Sweden participated as a combatant. Swedish troops partake in peace-keeping missions and currently have forces deployed in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Kosovo]].  .

[[File:Farewell to home, Göteborg, 1905.jpg|thumb|upright|Swedish emigrants boarding ship in [[Gothenburg]] in 1905]]
There was a significant population increase during the 18th and 19th centuries, which the writer [[Esaias Tegnér]] in 1833 attributed to ''"the peace, the ([[smallpox]]) [[vaccine]], and the [[potato]]es"''. <ref>{{cite book|coauthors=Paul Robert Magocsi|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Canada's Peoples|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=0-8020-2938-8|page=1220|author=Paul Robert Magocsi, editor.}}</ref> Between 1750 and 1850, the population in Sweden doubled. According to some scholars, mass emigration to America became the only way to prevent famine and rebellion; over 1% of the population emigrated annually during the 1880s. <ref name="Einhorn">
 Einhorn, Eric and John Logue (1989). 
 ''Modern Welfare States: Politics and Policies in Social''
 ''Democratic Scandinavia''. Praeger Publishers, p. 9: "Though
 Denmark, where industrialization had begun in the 1850s, was
 reasonably prosperous by the end of the nineteenth century, both
 Sweden and Norway were terribly poor. Only the safety valve of
 mass emigration to America prevented famine and rebellion. At
 the peak of emigration in the 1880s, over 1% of the total
 population of both countries emigrated annually."
</ref>
Nevertheless, Sweden remained poor, retaining a nearly entirely agricultural economy even as Denmark and Western European countries began to industrialize. <ref name=Einhorn/><ref>Koblik, Steven (1975). 
 ''Sweden's Development from Poverty to Affluence 1750–1970'',
 University of Minnesota Press, pp. 8–9, "In economic and social
 terms the eighteenth century was more a transitional than a
 revolutionary period. Sweden was, in light of contemporary
 Western European standards, a relatively poor but stable country. 
 [...] It has been estimated that 75–80% of the population was
 involved in agricultural pursuits during the late eighteenth
 century. One hundred years later, the corresponding figure was
 still 72%."

Many looked towards America for a better life during this time. It is believed that between 1850 and 1910 more than one million Swedes moved to the United States. <ref>Einhorn, Eric and John Logue (1989), p. 8. </ref>
In the early 20th century, more Swedes lived in [[Chicago]] than in [[Gothenburg]] (Sweden's second largest city). <ref>Ulf Beijbom, [http://www.americanwest.com/swedemigr/pages/emigra.htm "European emigration"], The House of Emigrants, Växjö, Sweden. </ref> Most Swedish immigrants moved to the [[Midwestern United States]], with a large population in [[Minnesota]], with a few others moving to other parts of the United States and Canada.  . 

Despite the slow rate of industrialization into the 19th century, many important changes were taking place in the agrarian economy because of innovations and the large population growth. <ref name="Koblik9-10">Koblik, pp. 9–10. </ref> These innovations included government-sponsored programs of [[enclosure]], aggressive exploitation of agricultural lands, and the introduction of new crops such as the potato. <ref name="Koblik9-10"/> Because the Swedish peasantry had never been enserfed as elsewhere in Europe,<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-29865/Sweden#403810.hook Sweden: Social and economic conditions] (2007).

Retrieved 19 February 2007. </ref> the Swedish farming culture began to take on a critical role in the Swedish political process, which has continued through modern times with modern Agrarian party (now called the Centre Party). <ref>Koblik, p. 11: "The agrarian revolution in Sweden is of fundamental importance for Sweden's modern development. Throughout Swedish history the countryside has taken an unusually important role in comparison with other European states."</ref> Between 1870 and 1914, Sweden began developing the industrialized economy that exists today. <ref>Koblik, p. 90. "It is usually suggested that between 1870 and 1914 Sweden emerged from its primarily agrarian economic system into a modern industrial economy."</ref> . 

Strong grassroots movements sprung up in Sweden during the latter half of the 19th century ([[trade union]]s, [[temperance movement|temperance]] groups, and independent religious groups), creating a strong foundation of democratic principles. In 1889 The Swedish Social Democratic Party was founded. These movements precipitated Sweden's migration into a modern parliamentary democracy, achieved by the time of World War I. As the [[Industrial Revolution]] progressed during the 20th century, people gradually began moving into cities to work in factories and became involved in [[socialism|socialist]] unions. A communist revolution was avoided in 1917, following the re-introduction of [[parliamentarism]], and the country was [[democratization|democratized]].  .

Sweden remained officially neutral during World War I and World War II, although its neutrality during World War II has been disputed. <ref name="Koblik303-313">Koblik, pp. 303–313. </ref><ref>Nordstrom, p. 315: "Sweden's government attempted to maintain at least a semblance of neutrality while it bent to the demands of the prevailing side in the struggle. Although effective in preserving the country's sovereignty, this approach generated criticism at home from many who believed the threat to Sweden was less serious than the government claimed, problems with the warring powers, ill feelings among its neighbours, and frequent criticism in the postwar period."</ref> Sweden was under German influence for much of the war, as ties to the rest of the world were cut off through blockades. <ref name="Koblik303-313"/><!---Koblik, pg. 307. "Through the blockade of foreign trade that culminated in the establishment of the [[Skagerrak]] blockade in connection with the German invasion of Denmark and Norway in April 1940, Swedish imports were reduced by approximately one-half and exports by about one-third in comparison with the average volume of 1936–1938."---> The Swedish government felt that it was in no position to openly contest Germany,<ref name="NB313-319"/><!---Nordstrom, pg. 315 "Charting a path that might ensure the survival of the state was the government's primary goal."---><!---Nordstrom, p. 319 "For a time virtually all of Sweden's production of industrial goods and raw materials went to Germany in exchange for necessary fuels, food stuffs, and manufactured goods."---> and therefore made some concessions. <ref>{{cite book|last=Zubicky|first=Sioma|year=1997|title=Med förintelsen i bagaget|language=[[Swedish language|Swedish]]|publisher=Bonnier Carlsen|location=Stockholm|isbn=91-638-3436-7|page=122}}</ref> Sweden also supplied steel and machined parts to Germany throughout the war. However, Sweden supported Norwegian resistance, and in 1943 helped rescue Danish Jews from deportation to [[concentration camps]]. Sweden also supported Finland in the [[Winter War]] and the [[Continuation War]] with volunteers and [[materiel]].  . 

Toward the end of the war, Sweden began to play a role in humanitarian efforts and many refugees, among them many Jews from Nazi-occupied Europe, were saved partly because of the Swedish involvement in rescue missions at the internment camps and partly because Sweden served as a haven for refugees, primarily from the [[Nordic countries]] and the [[Baltic states]]. <ref name="NB313-319"/><!---Nordstrom, p. 317: "In the last year of the war, Sweden became a factor in humanitarian efforts and attempts to end the war. It also became a haven for refugees from ''Norden'' and the Baltic states, and Swedes were involved in rescuing Scandinavian victims of internment camps." --- Nordstrom, p. 318: "By late 1943 Sweden was a haven for some 11,000 refugees from Denmark, including over 7,000 Danish Jews, and about 30,000 Norwegians."---> The Swedish diplomat [[Raoul Wallenberg]] and his colleagues may have saved up to 100,000 Hungarian Jews. <ref>"[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/wallenberg.html Raoul Wallenberg]". Jewish Virtual Library. </ref> Nevertheless, internal and external critics have argued that Sweden could have done more to resist the Nazi war effort, even if risking occupation. <ref name="NB313-319">Nordstrom, pp. 313–319. </ref> . 

===Post-war era===. 
Sweden was officially a neutral country and remained outside [[NATO]] or [[Warsaw pact]] membership during the cold war, but privately Sweden's leadership had strong ties with the United States and other western governments. 
[[File:Tallberg house.JPG|thumb|A typical red house in [[Tällberg]], Sweden]]
Following the war, Sweden took advantage of an intact industrial base, social stability and its natural resources to expand its industry to supply the rebuilding of Europe. <ref name="NB335-339">Nordstrom, pp. 335–339. </ref><!---Recovery from the material damage and economic shocks of the war was more rapid than many expected."---> Sweden was part of the [[Marshall Plan]] and participated in the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development ([[OECD]]). During most of the post-war era, the country was governed by the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] largely in cooperation with [[Swedish Trade Union Confederation|trade unions]] and industry. The government actively pursued an internationally competitive manufacturing sector of primarily large corporations. <ref name="svensteinmo"/> . 

Sweden, like countries around the globe, entered a period of economic decline and upheaval, following the oil embargoes of 1973–74 and 1978–79. <ref>Nordstrom, p. 344: "During the last twenty-five years of the century a host of problems plagued the economies of Norden and the West. Although many were present before, the 1973 and 1980 global oil crises acted as catalysts in bringing them to the fore."</ref> In the 1980s pillars of Swedish industry were massively restructured. Shipbuilding was discontinued, wood pulp was integrated into modernized paper production, the steel industry was concentrated and specialized, and mechanical engineering was robotized. <ref>Krantz, Olle and Lennart Schön. 2007. Swedish Historical National Accounts, 1800–2000. Lund: Almqvist and Wiksell International. </ref> . 

Between 1970 and 1990 the overall tax burden rose by over 10%, and the growth was low compared to other countries in Western Europe. Eventually government spent over half of the country's [[gross domestic product]]. Sweden GDP per capita ranking declined during this time. <ref name="svensteinmo">''Globalization and Taxation: Challenges to the Swedish Welfare State''. By Sven Steinmo. </ref> .

==Geography==. 
{{Main|Geography of Sweden}}
[[File:Suorvajaure in stora sjofallet park.jpg|thumb|left|197px|View of the [[Stora Sjöfallet National Park]]]]
Situated in [[Northern Europe|Northern]] [[Europe]], Sweden lies west of the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Gulf of Bothnia]], providing a long coastline, and forms the eastern part of the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]]. To the west is the [[Scandinavian mountain chain]] (Skanderna), a range that separates Sweden from [[Norway]]. [[Finland]] is located to its northeast. It has maritime borders with [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]], and it is also linked to [[Denmark]] (southwest) by the [[Öresund Bridge]].  . 

Sweden lies between latitudes [[55th parallel north|55°]] and [[70th parallel north|70° N]], and mostly between longitudes [[11th meridian east|11°]] and [[25th meridian east|25° E]] (part of [[Stora Drammen]] island is just west of 11°).  . 

At {{convert|449964|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, Sweden is the 55th largest country in the world,<ref>{{cite web|title=Country Comparison: Area|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html?countryName=Sweden&countryCode=sw&regionCode=eu&rank=55#sw|work=Central Intelligence Agency|publisher=Cia.gov|accessdate=19 August 2010}}</ref> the 4th [[Area and population of European countries|largest country entirely in Europe]], and the largest in Northern Europe. The lowest elevation in Sweden is in the bay of Lake Hammarsjön, near [[Kristianstad]] at {{convert. |-2.41|m|ft|2|abbr=on}} below sea level. The highest point is [[Kebnekaise]] at {{convert|2111|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. 
[[File:Swedish landscape - ramsjö.jpg|thumb|right|185px|Lake landscape at the outskirts of [[Ramsjö]]]] . 

Sweden has 25 [[Provinces of Sweden|provinces]] or ''landskap'' (landscapes), based on culture, geography and history. While these provinces serve no political or administrative purpose, they play an important role for people's self-identification. The provinces are usually grouped together in three large ''[[lands of Sweden|lands]]'', parts, the northern [[Norrland]], the central [[Svealand]] and southern [[Götaland]]. The sparsely populated Norrland encompasses almost 60% of the country.  . 

About 15% of Sweden lies north of the [[Arctic Circle]]. Southern Sweden is predominantly agricultural, with increasing forest coverage northward. Around 65% of Sweden's total land area is covered with forests. The highest population density is in the [[Øresund Region|Öresund Region]] in southern Sweden, along the western coast up to central [[Bohuslän]], and in the valley of lake [[Mälaren]] and Stockholm. [[Gotland]] and [[Öland]] are Sweden's largest [[islands of Sweden|islands]]; [[Vänern]] and [[Vättern]] are its largest lakes. Vänern is the third largest in Europe, after [[Lake Ladoga]] and [[Lake Onega]] in Russia.  . 

===Climate===. 
{{wide image|Kebnekaise Panorama.jpg|900px|The [[Scandinavian Mountains]]}} . 

Most of Sweden has a [[temperate climate]], despite its northern [[latitude]], with four distinct seasons and mild temperatures throughout the year. The country can be divided into three types of climate; the southernmost part has an [[oceanic climate]], the central part has a [[humid continental climate]] and the northernmost part has a [[subarctic climate]]. 
However, Sweden is much warmer and drier than other places at a similar latitude, and even somewhat farther south, mainly because of the [[Gulf Stream]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/climate/impact/gulf_stream.shtml|title=BBC Climate and the Gulf Stream|accessdate=2008-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/div/ocp/gs/|title=The Gulf Stream Myth|accessdate=2008-10-29}}</ref> For example, central and southern Sweden has much warmer winters than many parts of Russia, Canada, and the northern United States. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/WAICENT/FAOINFO/SUSTDEV/EIdirect/climate/EIsp0002.htm|title=Global Climate Maps}}</ref> Because of its high latitude, the length of daylight varies greatly. North of the [[Arctic Circle]], the sun never sets for part of each summer, and it never rises for part of each winter. In the capital, [[Stockholm]], daylight lasts for more than 18 hours in late June but only around 6 hours in late December. Sweden receives between 1,100 to 1,900 hours of sunshine annually. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smhi.se/cmp/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=7608&a=21429&l=sv|title=Number of hours with sunshine (map)|publisher=Swedish Meteorological Institute}}{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smhi.se/klimatdata/meteorologi/stralning/1.3052 |title=Normal solskenstid för ett år &#124; SMHI |language={{sv icon}} |publisher=Smhi.se |accessdate=2010-01-27}}</ref> .

On average, most of Sweden receives between 500 and 800&nbsp;mm (20 and 31&nbsp;in) of precipitation each year, making it considerably drier than the [[Precipitation (meteorology)|global average]]. The southwestern part of the country receives more precipitation, between 1000 and 1200&nbsp;mm (39 and 47&nbsp;in), and some mountain areas in the north are estimated to receive up to 2000&nbsp;mm (79&nbsp;in).

==Politics==. 
{{Main|Politics of Sweden}} . 

Sweden is a [[constitutional monarchy]], in which [[King Carl XVI Gustaf]] is head of state, but royal power has long been limited to official and ceremonial functions. <ref>[http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Quick-facts/Sweden-in-brief/Government-Politics/ ]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref> The [[Economist Intelligence Unit]], while acknowledging that democracy is difficult to measure, listed Sweden in fourth place in 2010 in its [[Democracy Index#2010 rankings|index of democracy]] assessing 167 countries.  . 

The nation's legislative body is the [[Parliament of Sweden|riksdag]] (Swedish Parliament), with 349 members, which chooses the [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Prime Minister]]. Parliamentary elections are held every four years, on the third Sunday of September. 
[[File:SWE-Map Kommuner2007.svg|thumb|upright|Sweden municipal borders]] . 

===Administrative divisions===. 
{{Main|Counties of Sweden|Municipalities of Sweden}} . 

Sweden is a [[unitary state]], currently divided into [[Counties of Sweden|twenty-one counties]] ({{lang|sv|''[[län]]''}}): [[Stockholm County|Stockholm]], [[Uppsala County|Uppsala]], [[Södermanland County|Södermanland]], [[Östergötland County|Östergötland]], [[Jönköping County|Jönköping]], [[Kronoberg County|Kronoberg]], [[Kalmar County|Kalmar]], [[Gotland County|Gotland]], [[Blekinge County|Blekinge]], [[Skåne County|Skåne]], [[Halland County|Halland]], [[Västra Götaland County|Västra Götaland]], [[Värmland County|Värmland]], [[Örebro County|Örebro]], [[Västmanland County|Västmanland]], [[Dalarna County|Dalarna]], [[Gävleborg County|Gävleborg]], [[Västernorrland County|Västernorrland]], [[Jämtland County|Jämtland]], [[Västerbotten County|Västerbotten]] and [[Norrbotten County|Norrbotten]].  . 

Each county has a [[County Administrative Boards of Sweden|County Administrative Board]] or ''länsstyrelse'', which is a Government appointed board. It is led by a Governor or ''Landshövding'' appointed for a term of six years and the list of succession, in most cases, stretches back to 1634 when the counties were created by the Swedish Lord High Chancellor [[Axel Oxenstierna]]. The main responsibility of the County Administrative Board is to coordinate the development of the county in line with goals set in national politics. In each county there is also a [[County Councils of Sweden|County Council]] or ''landsting'' which is a policy-making assembly elected by the residents of the county.  . 

Each county further divides into a number of [[Municipalities of Sweden|municipalities]] or ''kommuner'', with a total of 290 municipalities in 2004. [[Municipality|Municipal]] government in Sweden is similar to [[city commission government]] and [[cabinet-style council]] government. A legislative municipal assembly ''([[kommunfullmäktige]])'' of between 31 and 101 members (always an uneven number) is elected from [[party-list proportional representation]] at municipal elections, held every four years in conjunction with the national parliamentary elections.  . 

The municipalities are divided into a total of 2,512 [[Parishes of Sweden|parishes]], or ''församlingar''. These have traditionally been a subdivision of the [[Church of Sweden]] but still have importance as districts for census and elections. 
There are older historical divisions, primarily the [[Provinces of Sweden|twenty-five provinces]] and [[Lands of Sweden|three lands]], which still retain cultural significance.

===Political history===. 
[[File:Scandinavia-12th century.png|thumb|left|Kingdoms of [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Svear]] (Sweonas) and [[Götar]] (Geats) in the 12th century, with modern borders in grey]]

| &nbsp;
|How and when the Swedish kingdom appeared is not known. It is not until the 12th century that written document begin to be produced in Sweden in any larger extent [...]
|}</ref> It depends mostly on whether Sweden should be considered a nation when the ''[[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Svear]]'' (Sweonas) ruled [[Svealand]] or if the emergence of the nation started with the ''Svear'' and the ''[[Götar]]'' ([[Geats]]) of [[Götaland]] being united under one ruler. In the first case, Sweden was first mentioned as having one single ruler in the year 98 by [[Tacitus]], but it is almost impossible to know for how long it had been this way. However, historians usually start the line of [[Swedish monarchs]] from when Svealand and Götaland were ruled under the same king, namely [[Eric VI of Sweden|Erik the Victorious]] (Geat) and his son [[Olof Skötkonung]] in the 10th century. These events are often described as the [[consolidation of Sweden]], although substantial areas were conquered and incorporated later.  . 

Earlier kings, for which no reliable historical sources exist, can be read about in [[mythical kings of Sweden]] and [[semi-legendary kings of Sweden]]. Many of these kings are only mentioned in various [[Norse sagas|saga]] and blend with [[Norse mythology]].  . 

The title ''Sveriges och Götes Konung'' was last used for [[Gustaf I of Sweden]], after which the title became "[[Kings of Sweden|King of Sweden]], [[King of the Goths|of the Goths]] and [[King of the Wends|of the Wends]]" (''Sveriges, Götes och Vendes Konung'') in official documentation. Up until the beginning of the 1920s, all laws in Sweden were introduced with the words, "We, the king of Sweden, of the Goths and Wends". This title was used up until 1973. <ref>[http://lagen.nu/1973:702 Kungl. Maj:ts kungörelse med anledning av konung Gustaf VI Adolfs frånfälle]. SFS 1973:702. Justitiedepartementet L6, 19 September 1973. </ref> The present King of Sweden, [[Carl XVI Gustaf]], was the first monarch officially proclaimed "King of Sweden" (''Sveriges Konung'') with no additional peoples mentioned in his title.  . 

The term ''riksdag'' was used for the first time in the 1540s, although the first meeting where representatives of different social groups were called to discuss and determine affairs affecting the country as a whole took place as early as 1435, in the town of [[Arboga]]. <ref name="Riksdagen">The Swedish Parliament. [http://www.riksdagen.se/templates/R_Page____798.aspx The history of the Riksdag]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}. Retrieved 13 February 2007. </ref> During the assemblies of 1527 and 1544, under King [[Gustav Vasa]], representatives of all four [[estates of the realm]] ([[clergy]], [[Swedish nobility|nobility]], [[Bourgeoisie|townsmen]] and [[peasants]]) were called on to participate for the first time. <ref name="Riksdagen"/> The monarchy became hereditary in 1544.  . 

Executive power was historically shared between the King and a noble [[Privy Council]] until 1680, followed by the King's [[autocracy|autocratic rule]] initiated by the common estates of the Parliament. As a reaction to the failed [[Great Northern War]], a [[parliamentary system]] was introduced in 1719, followed by three different flavours of [[constitutional monarchy]] in 1772, 1789 and 1809, [[Swedish constitution of 1809|the latter]] granting several civil liberties. The monarch remains as the formal, but merely symbolic, [[head of state]] with [[ceremony|ceremonial]] duties.  . 

The [[Riksdag of the Estates]] consisted of two chambers. In 1866 Sweden became a [[constitutional monarchy]] with a [[bicameral]] parliament, with the First Chamber indirectly elected by [[local government]]s, and the Second Chamber directly elected in national elections every four years. In 1971 the parliament became [[unicameral]]. Legislative power was (symbolically) shared between king and parliament until 1975. Swedish [[taxation]] is controlled by the [[Parliament of Sweden]] (riksdagen).  . 

Sweden has a history of strong political involvement by ordinary people through its "popular movements" (''Folkrörelser''), the most notable being [[trade unions]], the independent Christian movement, the [[temperance movement]], the [[women's movement]] and more recently the sports{{Clarify|date=April 2009}} and [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|intellectual property pirate]] movements.  . 

Sweden is currently leading the EU in statistics measuring [[equality of opportunity|equality]] in the political system and equality in the [[education]] system. <ref name=EUEqualityReport>European Commission Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs And Equal Opportunities, ''Report On The Equality Between Men And Women'',http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/publications/2006/keaj06001_en.pdf February 2006</ref> The ''Global Gender Gap Report 2006'' ranked Sweden as the number one country in terms of [[gender equality]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norden.org/webb/news/news.asp?lang=6&id=6605 |title=Nordic countries rank highest in gender equality |publisher=Norden.org |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> . 

===Political system===. 
[[File:Sveriges riksdag fr vasabron.JPG|thumb|190px|The [[Parliament House, Stockholm|Parliament House]] in [[Stockholm]].]]
[[File:King Carl XVI Gustaf at National Day 2009.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|Carl XVI Gustaf]], the [[Monarchy of Sweden|King of Sweden]] and ceremonial head of state]]
Constitutionally, the 349-member riksdag ([[Parliament]]) holds supreme authority in modern Sweden. The riksdag is responsible for choosing the prime minister, who then appoints the government department heads (cabinet ministers). [[Legislative power]] is only exercised by the riksdag. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the prime minister and the cabinet, while the [[judiciary]] is independent. Sweden lacks compulsory [[judicial review (theory)|judicial review]], although the non-compulsory review carried out by ''lagrådet'' (Law Council) is mostly respected in technical matters but less so in controversial political matters. Acts of the parliament and government decrees can be made inapplicable at every level if they are manifestly against constitutional laws. However, because of the restrictions in this form of judicial review and a weak judiciary, this has had little practical consequence.  . 

Legislation may be initiated by the cabinet or by members of Parliament. Members are elected on the basis of [[proportional representation]] to a four-year term. The [[Constitution of Sweden]] can be altered by the riksdag, which requires a simple but absolute majority with two separate votes, separated by general elections in between. Sweden has three other constitutional laws: the Act of Royal Succession, the Freedom of Press Act and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression.  . 

The [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] has played a leading political role since 1917, after [[Reformist]]s had confirmed their strength and the [[Left Party (Sweden)|revolutionaries]] left the party. After 1932, cabinets have been dominated by the Social Democrats. Only five general elections (1976, 1979, 1991, 2006 and 2010) have given the centre-right bloc enough seats in Parliament to form a government. However, due to poor economic performance since the beginning of the 1970s, and especially since the fiscal crisis of the early 1990s, Sweden's political system has become less one-sided, and more like other European countries.  . 

In the [[Sweden general election, 2006|2006 general election]] the [[Moderate Party]], allied with the [[Centre Party (Sweden)|Centre Party]], [[Liberal People's Party (Sweden)|Liberal People's Party]], and the [[Christian Democrats (Sweden)|Christian Democrats]] formed the centre-right [[Alliance for Sweden]] and won a majority of the votes. Together they formed a majority government under the leadership of the Moderate party's leader [[Fredrik Reinfeldt]]. In the [[Sweden general election, 2010|September 2010]] election the Alliance contended against a unified left block consisting of the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Left Party. It also saw the first election of the [[Sweden Democrats]] into the riksdag. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Society/Government-politics/Reading/Center-right-wins-Swedish-election--but-short-of-majority/|title=Center–right wins Swedish election — but short of majority|author=Sveriges Radio International/Radio Sweden|accessdate=2012-02-16|date=2010-09-20}}</ref> .

The Alliance won a plurality of 173 seats, but remained two seats short of a 175-seat majority. Nevertheless, neither the Alliance, nor the left block chose to form a coalition with the Sweden Democrats, and the Alliance is currently governing as a [[minority government]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.val.se/val/val2006/slutlig/R/rike/roster.html
|title=Val till riksdagen|author=The Official Website of the Swedish Election Authority}}</ref> . 

Election turnout in Sweden has always been high by international comparison, although it has declined in recent decades, and is currently around 80% (80.11 in [[Sweden general election, 2002|2002]], and 81.99% in [[Sweden general election, 2006|2006]]). Swedish politicians enjoyed a high degree of confidence from the citizens in the 1960s, However, that confidence level has since declined steadily, and is now at a markedly lower level than in its Scandinavian neighbours. <ref>{{cite book|editor=Pippa Norris|author=Sören Holmberg|title=Critical Citizens: Global Support for Democratic Government|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1999|pages=103–123|isbn=0198295685}}</ref> . 

Some Swedish political figures have become known worldwide, among these are: [[Raoul Wallenberg]], [[Folke Bernadotte]], former [[United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary General]] of the [[United Nations]] [[Dag Hammarskjöld]], former Prime Minister [[Olof Palme]], former Prime Minister and [[Foreign minister]] [[Carl Bildt]], former President of the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly of the United Nations]] [[Jan Eliasson]], and former [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] Iraq inspector [[Hans Blix]].  . 

===Law, law enforcement, and judicial system===. 
{{Main|Judicial system of Sweden}} . 

The [[Supreme Court of Sweden]] is the third and final instance in all civil and criminal cases in Sweden. Before a case can be decided by the [[Supreme Court]], leave to appeal must be obtained, and with few exceptions, leave to appeal can be granted only when the case is of interest as a [[precedent]]. The Supreme Court consists of 16 Councillors of Justice or ''justitieråd'' which are appointed by the [[Government of Sweden|government]], but the court as an institution is independent of the [[Parliament of Sweden]], and the government is not able to interfere with the decisions of the court.  . 

[[Law enforcement in Sweden]] is carried out by several government entities. The [[Swedish Police Service]] is a [[Government agencies in Sweden|Government agency]] concerned with [[police]] matters. The [[National Task Force]] is a national [[SWAT]] unit within the [[Swedish National Criminal Investigation Department|National Criminal Investigation Department]]. [[Swedish Security Service]]'s responsibilities are [[counter-espionage]], anti-[[terrorism|terrorist]] activities, protection of the [[constitution]] and protection of sensitive objects and people.  . 

According to a victimization survey of 1,201 residents in 2005, Sweden has above average [[crime rate]]s compared to other EU countries. Sweden has high or above average levels of assaults, sexual assaults, hate crimes, and consumer fraud. Sweden has low levels of burglary, car theft and drug problems. Bribe seeking is rare. <ref name="burdenofcrime2005">{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup-europe.be/downloads/EUICS%20-%20The%20Burden%20of%20Crime%20in%20the%20EU.pdf|format=PDF|title=EUICS report, The Burden of Crime in the EU, A Comparative Analysis of the|last=van Dijk|first=Jan|coauthors=Robert Manchin, John van Kesteren, Sami Nevala, Gergely Hideg|year=2005}}</ref> . 

===Foreign relations===. 
{{Main|Foreign relations of Sweden}}
Throughout the 20th century, [[Swedish foreign policy]] was based on the principle of non-alignment in peacetime and [[neutral country|neutrality]] in wartime. Sweden's government pursued an independent course of nonalignment in times of peace so that neutrality would be possible in the event of war. <ref name="NB335-339"/> . 

Sweden's doctrine of neutrality is often traced back to the 19th century as the country has not been in a [[war|state of war]] since the end of the [[Swedish campaign against Norway (1814)|Swedish campaign against Norway]] in 1814. During World War II Sweden joined neither the [[Allies (World War II)|allied]] nor [[Axis Powers|axis]] powers. This has sometimes been disputed since in effect Sweden allowed in select cases the Nazi regime to use its railroad system to transport troops and goods,<ref name="Koblik303-313" /><!---Koblik, p. 313---><ref name="NB313-319"/> especially iron ore from mines in northern Sweden, which was vital to the German war machine. <ref name="NB313-319"/><ref>Nordstrom p. 302: "In fact, the plans were mostly a ruse to establish control of the crucial Norwegian port of Narvik and the iron mines of northern Sweden, which were vitally important to the German war efforts."</ref> However, Sweden also indirectly contributed to the defence of Finland in the [[Winter War]], and permitted the training of Norwegian and Danish troops in Sweden after 1943. 
[[File:ODA percent of GNI 2009.png|thumb|[[Official development assistance|Development aid]] measured in [[Gross national income|GNI]] in 2009. Source: OECD. As a percentage Sweden is the largest donor.]]
During the early [[Cold War]] era, Sweden combined its policy of non-alignment and a low profile in international affairs with a [[security policy]] based on strong [[national defence]]. <ref>As context, according to [[Edwin Reischauer]], "To be neutral you must be ready to be highly militarized, like Switzerland or Sweden." – ''see'' Chapin, Emerson. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2DC163AF931A3575AC0A966958260&scp=1&sq=edwin+o+reischauer&st=nyt "Edwin Reischauer, Diplomat and Scholar, Dies at 79,"] ''New York Times. September 2, 1990. </ref> The function of the Swedish military was to deter attack. <ref>Nordstrom, p 336: "As a corollary, a security policy based on strong national defences designed to discourage, but not prevent, attack was pursued. For the next several decades, the Swedish poured an annual average of about 5% of GDP into making their defenses credible."</ref> At the same time, the country maintained relatively close informal connections with the Western bloc, especially in the realm of intelligence exchange. In 1952, a Swedish [[DC-3]] was [[Catalina affair|shot down]] over the Baltic Sea by a Soviet [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] [[jet aircraft|jet]] [[fighter aircraft|fighter]]. Later investigations revealed that the plane was actually gathering information for [[NATO]]. <ref>National Geographical News, web article, ''Cold War Spy Plane Found in Baltic Sea''[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/10/1010_031010_swedishspyplane.html] 10 November 2003. </ref> Another plane, a [[PBY Catalina|Catalina]] [[search and rescue]] plane, was sent out a few days later and shot down by the Soviets as well. Olof Palme, the former prime minister of Sweden, visited [[Cuba]] during the 1970s and showed his support for Cuba in his speech.  . 

Beginning in the late 1960s, Sweden for a period attempted to play a more significant and independent role in international relations. This involved significant activity in international peace efforts, especially through the [[United Nations]], and in support to the [[Third World]]. Since the assassination of [[Olof Palme]] in 1986 and the end of the Cold War, this has been significantly toned down, although Sweden remains comparatively active in peace keeping missions and maintains a generous foreign aid budget.  . 

In 1981 a Soviet [[Whiskey class submarine]] ran aground close to the Swedish naval base at [[Karlskrona]] in the southern part of the country. It has never been clearly established whether the submarine ended up on the shoals through a navigational mistake or if it was a matter of [[espionage]] against Swedish military potential. The incident triggered a diplomatic crisis between Sweden and the Soviet Union.  . 

Since 1995 Sweden has been a member of the [[European Union]], and as a consequence of a new world security situation the country's foreign policy doctrine has been partly modified, with Sweden playing a more active role in European security co-operation.  . 

===Military===. 
{{Main|Swedish Armed Forces}}
[[File:Swedish JAS-39 Gripen landing.jpg|thumb|The [[JAS 39 Gripen]] is an advanced Swedish multi-role [[fighter aircraft]] of the [[Swedish Air Force]].]]
''Försvarsmakten'' ([[Swedish Armed Forces]]) is a government agency reporting to the Swedish [[Ministry of Defence (Sweden)|Ministry of Defence]] and responsible for the [[peacetime]] operation of the armed forces of Sweden. The primary task of the agency is to train and deploy peace support forces abroad, while maintaining the long-term ability to refocus on the defence of Sweden in the event of war. The armed forces are divided into [[Army]], [[Air Force]] and [[Navy]]. The head of the armed forces is the [[Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces|Supreme Commander]] (''Överbefälhavaren'', ÖB), the most senior officer in the country. Up to 1974 the head of state (=the King) was ''pro forma'' Commander-in-Chief, but in reality it was clearly understood all through the 20th century that the Monarch would have no ''active'' role as a military leader.  . 

When King [[Gustav V]] asserted his right to decide and bypass the government in military matters just before the First World War (''"borggårdskrisen"'', the Castle Court Crisis) it was seen as a deliberate provocation against established terms of how the country would be ruled. The office of an appointed Supreme Commander was set up in 1939; before that date, from the late 19th century onwards, the leading men of the army and navy would report directly to the cabinet (and the king), and no fully unified command existed in the professional military sphere itself.  . 

[[File:Swedish CV9040.JPG|thumb|left|The Infantry fighting vehicle [[Strf 90]] produced and used by Sweden.]]
Until the end of the Cold War, nearly all males reaching the age of [[military service]] were [[conscription|conscripted]]. In recent years, the number of conscripted males has shrunk dramatically, while the number of female volunteers has increased slightly. Recruitment has generally shifted towards finding the most motivated recruits, rather than solely those otherwise most fit for service. All soldiers serving abroad must by law be volunteers. In 1975 the total number of conscripts was 45,000. By 2003 it was down to 15,000.  . 

On 1 July 2010 Sweden stopped routine conscription, switching to an all volunteer force unless otherwise required for defence readiness. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forsvarsmakten.se/sv/Rekrytering/Varnplikt/|title=Värnplikt [Conscription]|accessdate=2010-04-21}}{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://svt.se/2.22620/1.1595556/allmanna_varnplikten_skrotas?lid=puff_1597044&lpos=extra_0|title=Allmänna värnplikten skrotas [General conscription scrapped]|accessdate=2010-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/21494/20090816/|title=Military conscription phase out under fire|accessdate=2010-04-21}}</ref> The need to recruit only the soldiers later prepared to volunteer for international service will be emphasized. The total forces gathered would consist of about 60,000 men. This could be compared with the 80s before the fall of the Soviet Union, when Sweden could gather up to 1,000,000 men.  . 

Swedish units have taken part in peacekeeping operations in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Cyprus]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Kosovo]], [[Liberia]], [[Lebanon]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Chad]].  . 

Currently, one of the most important tasks for the Swedish Armed Forces has been to form a Swedish-led [[European Union Battlegroups|EU Battle Group]] to which Norway, Finland, Ireland and Estonia will also contribute. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/9133/a/82276|title=The EU Battlegroup Concept and the Nordic Battlegroup|accessdate=2008-01-19|author=Swedish Ministry of Defence|date=2008-01-08|publisher=Government Offices of Sweden}}</ref>
The [[Nordic Battle Group]] (NBG) had a 10-day deployment readiness during the first half of 2008 and, although Swedish-led, had its Operational Headquarters (OHQ) in [[Northwood, London|Northwood]], outside London.  . 

==Economy==. 
{{Main|Economy of Sweden}}
[[File:Sweden GRP per Capita2004.svg|thumb|upright|[[Gross Regional Product]] (GRP) per capita in thousands of kronor (2004).]]
[[File:Nordstan Öst.JPG|thumb|left|195px|[[Nordstan]] is one of the largest shopping malls in northern Europe]]
Sweden is an export-oriented [[mixed economy]] featuring a modern distribution system, excellent internal and external [[communications]], and a skilled [[Workforce|labour]] force. [[Timber]], [[hydropower]] and [[iron ore]] constitute the resource base of an economy heavily oriented toward [[foreign trade]]. Sweden's engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and exports. Telecommunications, the automotive industry and the pharmaceutical industries are also of great importance. [[Agriculture]] accounts for 2% of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] and employment. Income is relatively flatly distributed, Sweden has the lowest [[Gini coefficient]] (0.23) of any country.  . 

In terms of structure, the Swedish economy is characterised by a large, knowledge-intensive and export-oriented manufacturing sector, an increasing, but comparatively small, [[business]] [[service sector]], and by international standards, a large public service sector. Large organisations both in manufacturing and services dominate the [[Swedish economy]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoexport.gc.ca/science/nordics_sweden_report-en.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061004050916/http://www.infoexport.gc.ca/science/nordics_sweden_report-en.htm|archivedate=2006-10-04 |title=Doing Business Abroad – Innovation, Science and Technology |publisher=Infoexport.gc.ca |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> .

The typical worker receives 40% of his or her income after the [[tax wedge]]. The slowly declining overall taxation, 51.1% of GDP in 2007, is still nearly double of that in the United States or Ireland. The share of employment financed via tax income amounts to a third of Swedish workforce, a substantially higher proportion than in most other countries. Overall, GDP growth has been fast since reforms in the early 1990s, especially in manufacturing. <ref name="oecd2005">OECD Economic Surveys: Sweden – Volume 2005 Issue 9 by OECD Publishing</ref> .

Sweden maintains its own currency, the [[Swedish krona]] (SEK), a result of the Swedes having rejected the [[euro]] in a referendum. The Swedish [[Sveriges Riksbank|Riksbank]]—founded in 1668 and thus making it the oldest central bank in the world—is currently focusing on price stability with an [[inflation]] target of 2%. According to the ''Economic Survey of Sweden 2007'' by the OECD, the average inflation in Sweden has been one of the lowest among European countries since the mid-1990s, largely because of deregulation and quick utilisation of globalisation. <ref name="oecd2007">{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/37/0,3343,en_2649_34569_38048997_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=Economic survey of Sweden 2007 |publisher=Oecd.org |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2010-08-25}}</ref> . 

The largest trade flows are with Germany, the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Finland.  . 

===Energy===. 
{{See also|Nordic energy market|Nuclear power phase-out in Sweden|Oil phase-out in Sweden}} . 

Sweden's energy market is largely privatized. The [[Nordic energy market]] is one of the first liberalized energy markets in Europe and it is traded in [[NASDAQ OMX Commodities Europe]] and [[Nord Pool Spot]]. In 2006, out of a total electricity production of 139 [[TWh]], electricity from hydropower accounted for 61 TWh (44%), and [[nuclear power]] delivered 65 TWh (47%). At the same time, the use of [[biofuel]]s, [[peat]] etc. produced 13 TWh (9%) of electricity, while wind power produced 1 TWh (1%). Sweden was a net importer of electricity by a margin of 6 TWh. <ref>[http://www.svenskenergi.se/upload/Statistik/Tidigare%20statistik/Kraftl%C3%A4get%20i%20%C3%A5r/ve_07-01.pdf Kraftläget i Sverige, Vattensituationen]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> [[Biomass]] is mainly used to produce heat for [[district heating]] and [[central heating]] and industry processes.  . 

The [[1973 oil crisis]] strengthened Sweden's commitment to decrease dependence on imported fossil fuels. Since then, [[electricity]] has been generated mostly from [[hydropower]] and nuclear power. The use of nuclear power has been limited, however. Among other things, the accident of [[Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station]] (United States) prompted the [[Swedish parliament]] to ban new nuclear plants. In March 2005, an opinion poll showed that 83% supported maintaining or increasing nuclear power. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://world-nuclear.org/info/inf42.html |title=Nuclear Power in Sweden |publisher=[[World Nuclear Association]] |date=September 2009 |accessdate=2010-01-29}}</ref> Politicians have made announcements about [[oil phase-out in Sweden]], decrease of nuclear power, and multi-billion dollar investments in [[renewable energy]] and energy efficiency. <ref name="Agenda21"/><ref name="Vidal">Vidal, John.

[[File:Hall, Stockholm Central Station.jpg|thumb|190px|left|[[Stockholm Central Station|The Stockholm Central Station]]]]
Sweden has {{convert|162707|km|mi|abbr=on}} of paved road and {{convert|1428|km|mi|abbr=on}} of expressways. [[List of motorways in Sweden|Motorway]]s run through Sweden, Denmark and over the [[Öresund Bridge]] to [[Stockholm]], [[Gothenburg]], [[Uppsala]] and [[Uddevalla]]. The system of motorways is still under construction and a new motorway from Uppsala to [[Gävle]] was finished on 17 October 2007. Sweden had left-hand traffic (Vänstertrafik in Swedish) from approximately 1736 and continued to do so well into the 20th century. Voters rejected right-hand traffic in 1955, but after the riksdag passed legislation in 1963 changeover took place in 1967, known in Swedish as [[Dagen H]].  . 

The [[Stockholm metro]] is the only subway system in Sweden and serves the city of Stockholm, 100 metro stations are in use.  . 

The [[rail transport]] market is privatized, but while there are many privately owned enterprises, many operators are still owned by state. The counties have financing, ticket and marketing responsibility for local trains. For other trains the operators handle tickets and marketing themselves. Operators include [[SJ AB|SJ]], [[Veolia Transport]], [[DSB (railway company)|DSB]], [[Green Cargo]], [[Tågkompaniet]] and [[Inlandsbanan]]. Most of the railways are owned and operated by [[Trafikverket]].  . 

The largest airports include [[Stockholm-Arlanda Airport]] (16.1 million passengers in 2009) {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Stockholm, [[Gothenburg-Landvetter Airport]] (4.3 million passengers in 2008), and [[Stockholm-Skavsta Airport]] (2.0 million passengers). Sweden hosts the two largest port companies in Scandinavia, [[Port of Göteborg|Port of Göteborg AB]] ([[Gothenburg]]) and the transnational company [[Copenhagen Malmö Port|Copenhagen Malmö Port AB]].  . 

===Public policy===. 
{{See also|Nordic model|Swedish welfare}}
Sweden has one of the most highly developed welfare states in the world. The country has a higher level of social spending to GDP than any other nation. Additionally it provides equal as well as comprehensive access to education and health care.  . 

Historically, Sweden provided solid support for [[free trade]] (except agriculture) and mostly relatively strong and stable property rights (both private and public), though some economists have pointed out that Sweden promoted industries with tariffs and used publicly subsidised R&D during the country's early critical years of industrialisation. <ref name="H-J.C-Sweden">Kicking Away The Ladder, pp. 39–42, Ha-Joon Chang. </ref> After World War II a succession of governments expanded the welfare state by raising the tax level. During this period Sweden's economic growth was also one of the highest in the industrial world. A series of successive social reforms transformed the country into one of the most equal and developed on earth. The consistent growth of the welfare state led to Swedes achieving unprecedented levels of social mobility and quality of life—to this day Sweden consistently ranks at the top of league tables for health, literacy and Human Development—far ahead of some wealthier countries (for example the United States). <ref name = "Equal Societies">[http://www.health.gov.au/internet/nhhrc/publishing.nsf/Content/135-interim/$FILE/135%20-%20Submission%20-%20Childrens%20Hospitals%20Australasia%20(Attachment%20C).pdf], Richard Wilkinson & Kate Pickett</ref> . 

However, from the 1970s and onwards Sweden's GDP growth fell behind other industrialised countries and the country's per capita ranking fell from the 4th to 14th place in a few decades. <ref name="eu-usa">[http://www.timbro.se/bokhandel/pdf/9175665646.pdf EU versus USA], Fredrik Bergström & Robert Gidehag</ref> From the mid 90s until today Sweden's economic growth has once again accelerated and has been higher than in most other industrialised countries (including the US) during the last 15 years. <ref name="growth-Swe">[http://www.ekonomifakta.se/en/Facts-and-figures/Economy/Economic-growth/GDP-per-capita-/ Sweden's GDP per capita] Ekonomifakta</ref> . 

Sweden began slowing the expansion of the welfare state in the 1980s, or even trimming it back, and according to the OECD and [[McKinsey]], Sweden has recently been relatively quick to adopt neo-liberal policies, such as deregulation, compared to countries such as France. <ref name="oecd2007"/><ref>[http://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/mginews/businessweek/swedenbalance.asp Sweden's balancing lessons for Europe], [[McKinsey]] IMG institute 2006</ref> The current Swedish government is continuing the trend of moderate rollbacks of previous social reforms. <ref name="oecd2007"/><ref>[http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=9803876 Moderate revolution], ''[[The Economist]]'' September 13, 2007</ref> Growth has been higher than in many other [[EU-15]] countries.  . 

Sweden adopted neo-liberal agricultural policies in 1990. Since the 1930s, the agricultural sector had been subject to price controls. In June 1990, the Parliament voted for a new agricultural policy marking a significant shift away from price controls. As a result, food prices fell somewhat. However, the liberalizations soon became moot because EU agricultural controls supervened. <ref>Lindberg, Henrik. "The Role of Economists in Liberalising Swedish Agriculture" (May 2007). [http://econjwatch.org/issues/volume-4-number-1-may-2007]</ref> . 

Since the late 1960s, Sweden has had the highest tax quota (as percentage of GDP) in the industrialised world, although today the gap has narrowed and Denmark has surpassed Sweden as the most heavily taxed country among developed countries. Sweden has a two step [[progressive tax]] scale with a municipal income tax of about 30% and an additional high-income state tax of 20–25% when a salary exceeds roughly 320,000 SEK per year. [[Payroll tax]]es amount to 32%. In addition, a national [[Value added tax|VAT]] of 25% is added to many things bought by private citizens, with the exception of food (12% VAT), transportation, and books (6% VAT). Certain items are subject to additional taxes, e.g. electricity, petrol/diesel and alcoholic beverages.  . 

{{As of|2007}}, total tax revenue was 47.8% of GDP, the second highest tax burden among developed countries, down from 49.1% 2006. <ref>{{cite news |first=Kenneth |last=Westerlund |title=Danmark har högsta skattetrycket |url=http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=3130&a=750879 |publisher=DN |date=2008-03-11 |accessdate=2008-03-11}}</ref> Sweden's inverted [[tax wedge]] – the amount going to the service worker's wallet – is approximately 15% compared to 10% in Belgium, 30% in Ireland, and 50% in United States. <ref name="eu-usa"/> Public sector spending amounts to 53% of the GDP. State and municipal employees total around a third of the workforce, much more than in most Western countries. Only Denmark has a larger public sector (38% of Danish workforce). Spending on transfers is also high.  . 

Eighty percent of the workforce is organised in trade-unions which also have the right to elect two representatives to the board in all Swedish companies with more than 25 employees. Sweden has a relatively high amount of sick leave per worker in [[OECD]]: the average worker loses 24 days due to sickness. <ref name="oecd2005"/> In December 2008, the number employed in age group 16–64 was 75.0%. The employment tendency was very strong in 2007. The positive trend continued during the first half of 2008, but the rate of increase slackened. According to [[Statistics Sweden]], the unemployment rate in December 2008 was at 6.4%. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scb.se/Pages/PressArchive____259760.aspx?PressReleaseID=258940 |title=Unemployment rate in December 2008 (SCB, Statistics Sweden, central government authority for official statistics) |publisher=Scb.se |accessdate=2010-08-25}}</ref> . 

===Science=== . 

Altogether, the public and the private sector in Sweden allocate nearly four per cent of [[GDP]] to [[research & development]] (R&D) per year, which makes Sweden one of the countries that invest most in R&D in terms of percentage of GDP. The standard of Swedish research is high and Sweden is a world leader in a number of fields.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Sweden tops Europe in comparative statistics both in terms of research investments as a percentage of GDP as well as in the number of published scientific works per capita. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swedenabroad.se/Page____50008.aspx |title=Embassy of Sweden New Delhi – Science & Technology |publisher=Swedenabroad.se |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> . 

Though a relatively small country, Sweden has long been at the forefront of research and development.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}  For several decades the [[Swedish government]] has prioritized scientific and R&D activities. This strong engagement has helped make Sweden a leading country in terms of [[innovation]].  In international comparison, high-technology manufacturing is relatively large in all high-technology segments, and particularly in [[telecommunication]]s and [[pharmaceutical]]s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} . 

Sweden ranked either as the first or second country publishing the highest number of scientific publications in the fields of [[medical science]], [[natural science]] and [[engineering]] in 2001.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Sweden was world-leading in medical science and second only to Switzerland in natural science and engineering in terms of the number of publications per capita.  . 

===Technology===. 
{{Main|Swedish inventions}}

[[File:Carl von Linné.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Carl Linnaeus]] laid the foundations for the modern scheme of [[binomial nomenclature]]. He is known as the father of modern taxonomy, and is also considered one of the fathers of modern ecology.]] . 

In the 18th century Sweden's [[scientific revolution]] took off. Previously, technical progress had mainly come from mainland Europe. 
In 1739, the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] was founded, with people such as [[Carolus Linnaeus]] and [[Anders Celsius]] as early members. Many of the companies founded by early pioneers are still remain major international brands. [[Gustaf Dalén]] founded [[AGA AB|AGA]], and received the Nobel Prize for his [[sun valve]]. [[Alfred Nobel]] invented [[dynamite]] and instituted the [[Nobel Prize]]s. 
[[Lars Magnus Ericsson]] started the company bearing his name, [[Ericsson]], still one of the largest telecom companies in the world. [[Jonas Wenström]] was an early pioneer in [[alternating current]] and is along with [[Serbia]]n inventor [[Nikola Tesla]] credited as one of the inventors of the three-phase electrical system. <ref name="si91e"/> . 

The traditional engineering industry is still a major source of Swedish inventions, but pharmaceuticals, electronics and other high-tech industries are gaining ground. [[Tetra Pak]] was an invention for storing liquid foods, invented by [[Erik Wallenberg]]. [[Losec]], an ulcer medicine, was the world's best-selling drug in the 1990s and was developed by [[AstraZeneca]]. More recently [[Håkan Lans]] invented the [[Automatic Identification System]], a worldwide standard for shipping and civil aviation navigation. A large portion of the Swedish economy is to this day based on the export of technical inventions, and many large multinational corporations from Sweden have their origins in the ingenuity of Swedish inventors. <ref name="si91e">{{cite web|url = http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Education/Research/Facts/Innovation/|title=Innovation, Science/Research: Inventing tomorrow's world |publisher=Sweden.se |accessdate=2011-01-27|year=2010|month=February|work=Fact Sheet FS 4}}</ref> . 

Swedish inventors hold a total of 33,523 [[patent]]s in the United States as of 2007, according to the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]. As a nation, only ten other countries hold more patents than Sweden. <ref>[http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/cst_all.htm Patents By Country, State, and Year – All Patent Types (December 2007)]</ref> .

In varying degrees, depending largely on frequency of interaction with English, a majority of Swedes, especially those born after World War II, understand and speak English due to trade links, the popularity of overseas travel, a strong Anglo-American influence and the tradition of [[subtitle (captioning)|subtitling]] rather than dubbing foreign television shows and films, and the [[Germanic languages|relative similarity]] of the two languages which makes learning English easier. In a 2005 survey by [[Eurobarometer]], 89% of Swedes reported the ability to speak English. <ref>

English became a compulsory subject for [[secondary education|secondary school]] students studying [[natural science]]s as early as 1849, and has been a compulsory subject for all Swedish students since the late 1940s. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.lu.se/info/lum/LUM_07_99/01_engelska.html |title=English spoken – fast ibland hellre än bra |publisher=Lund University newsletter 7/1999 |language=Swedish}}</ref> Depending on the local school authorities, English is currently a compulsory subject between [[first grade]] and [[ninth grade]], with all students continuing in secondary school studying English for at least another year. Most students also study one and sometimes two additional languages. These include (but are not limited to) [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]] and Spanish. Some Danish and Norwegian is at times also taught as part of Swedish courses for native speakers.  . 

===Religion===. 
{{Main|Religion in Sweden}}
Before the 11th century, Swedes adhered to [[Norse paganism]], worshiping [[Æsir]] gods, with its centre at the [[temple at Uppsala|Temple in Uppsala]]. With [[Christianization]] in the 11th century, the laws of the country were changed, forbidding worship of other deities into the late 19th century.  . 

After the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 1530s, a change led by [[Martin Luther]]'s Swedish associate [[Olaus Petri]], the authority of the Roman Catholic Church was abolished. The church and state were separated, allowing [[Lutheranism]] to prevail. This process was completed by the [[Uppsala Synod]] of 1593. Lutheranism became Sweden's official religion. During the era following the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], usually known as the period of [[Lutheran Orthodoxy]], small groups of non-Lutherans, especially [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Dutch people|Dutchmen]], the [[Moravian Church]] and [[Walloons]] or [[French Huguenots]] from Belgium, played a significant role in trade and industry, and were quietly tolerated as long as they kept a low religious profile. The [[Sami people|Sami]] originally had their own shamanistic religion, but they converted to Lutheranism by the work of Swedish missionaries in the 17th and 18th centuries. 
[[File:Uppsala Cathedral.JPG|thumb|right|[[Uppsala Cathedral]]]] . 

With religious liberalizations in the late 18th century believers of other faiths, including [[Judaism]] and [[Roman Catholicism]], were allowed to openly live and work in the country. However, until 1860 it remained illegal for Lutheran Swedes to convert to another religion. The 19th century saw the arrival of various [[Low church|evangelical]] [[free church]]es, and, towards the end of the century, [[secularism]], leading many to distance themselves from Church rituals. Leaving the [[Church of Sweden]] became legal with the so-called dissenter law of 1860, but only under the provision of entering another Christian denomination. The right to stand outside any religious denomination was formally established in the Law on [[Freedom of Religion]] in 1951. In 2000 the Church of Sweden was separated from the state and Sweden ceased to have any official church.

At the end of 2009, 71.3% of Swedes belonged to the Church of Sweden (Lutheran); this number has been decreasing by about one percentage point a year for the last two decades. <ref name="Swedes%2520depart%2520church%2520in%2520droves"/><ref>[http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/ Church of Sweden], [http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/statistik/xls/medlem_diagram.xls Members 1972–2006, Excel document in Swedish]</ref> However, only approximately 2% of the church's members regularly attend Sunday services. <ref>[http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/SVK/eng/liturgy.htm "Liturgy and Worship"], Church of Sweden</ref>
The reason for the large number of inactive members is partly that until 1996, children automatically became members at birth if at least one of the parents was a member. Since 1996, only children that are christened become members. Some 275,000 Swedes are today members of various free churches (where congregation attendance is much higher), and, in addition, [[immigration]] has meant that there are now some 92,000 [[Roman Catholics]] and 100,000 [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christians]] living in Sweden. <ref>[[:sv:Frikyrka|Statistics about free churches and immigration churches from Swedish Wikipedia – in Swedish]]</ref> . 

Because of [[immigration]], Sweden also has a significant [[Muslim]] population. They number about 500,000, but only approximately 5% (25,000) of these actively practice Islam (in the sense of attending Friday prayer and praying five times a day). <ref>{{cite web|url=http://sydsvenskan.se/sverige/article140868.ece |title=Sydsvenskan (a Swedish newspaper) – in Swedish |publisher=Sydsvenskan.se |date=2006-02-08 |accessdate=2010-08-25}}</ref> . 

Despite a high formal membership rate in the [[Church of Sweden]], some studies have found Sweden to be one of the least religious countries in the world, with one of the highest levels of [[atheism]]. According to different studies, between 46% and 85% of Swedes do not believe in God. <ref>Zuckerman [http://web.archive.org/web/20070610084208/http://www.pitzer.edu/academics/faculty/zuckerman/atheism.html pitzer.edu]</ref> In the Eurostat survey, 23% of Swedish citizens responded that "they believe there is a God", whereas 53% answered that "they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force" and 23% that "they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force". Nevertheless, despite a lack of belief in God, these individuals resented the term atheist, and still called themselves Christians, being content with remaining in the Church of Sweden. <ref name = "Peter Steinfels">{{cite book| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/28/us/28beliefs.html?pagewanted=1|author=Peter Steinfels|title=Scandinavian Nonbelievers, Which Is Not to Say Atheists|publisher=New York Times|quote=Mr. Zuckerman, a sociologist who teaches at Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif., has reported his findings on religion in Denmark and Sweden in “Society Without God” (New York University Press, 2008). Much that he found will surprise many people, as it did him. The many nonbelievers he interviewed, both informally and in structured, taped and transcribed sessions, were anything but antireligious, for example. They typically balked at the label “atheist.” An overwhelming majority had in fact been baptized, and many had been confirmed or married in church. Though they denied most of the traditional teachings of Christianity, they called themselves Christians, and most were content to remain in the Danish National Church or the Church of Sweden, the traditional national branches of Lutheranism.|accessdate =2007-12-31| year = 2009}}</ref> Other research has shown that religion in Sweden continues to play a role in cultural identity. <ref name = "David Herbert">{{cite book| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=9IuL2MEr_EoC&pg=PA13|author=David Herbert|title=Religion and civil society: rethinking public religion in the contemporary world|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|quote=More than 80 percent of adults continue to choose to belong to the Lutheran Church in spite of its recent disestablishment and the cost of having to pay the church tax.

===Health===. 
{{See also|Healthcare in Sweden|Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare}}
Healthcare in Sweden is similar in quality to other developed nations. Sweden ranks in the top five countries with respect to low [[infant mortality]]. It also ranks high in [[life expectancy]] and in safe [[drinking water]]. A person seeking care first contacts a clinic for a doctor's appointment, and may then be referred to a specialist by the clinic physician, who may in turn recommend either in-patient or out-patient treatment, or an elective care option. The health care is governed by the 21 [[County Councils of Sweden|landsting]] of Sweden and is mainly funded by taxes, with nominal fees for patients.  . 

===Education===. 
{{Main|Education in Sweden}}
[[File:Entrance hall of Uppsala University main building.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Uppsala University]] (established 1477)]]
Children aged 1–5 years old are guaranteed a place in a public [[kindergarten]] ({{lang-sv|förskola}} or, colloquially, ''dagis''). Between the ages of 6 and 16, children attend compulsory comprehensive school. In the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA), Swedish 15-year-old pupils score close to the OECD average. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/8/39700724.pdf |title=PISA results for Sweden |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-08-25}}</ref> After completing the 9th grade, about 90% of the students continue with a three-year upper secondary school (''gymnasium''), which can lead to both a job qualification or entrance eligibility to university. The school system is largely financed by taxes.  . 

The Swedish government treats public and independent schools equally<ref name="swedishmodeleconomist">[http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11535645 The Swedish model], [[The Economist]]</ref> by introducing [[education voucher]]s in 1992 as one of the first countries in the world after [[The Netherlands]]. Anyone can establish a for-profit school and the municipality must pay new schools the same amount as municipal schools get. 
School lunch is free for all students in Sweden, and usually includes one or two different kinds of hot meals, a vegetarian meal, salad bar, fruit, bread, milk and water. Some schools, especially kindergartens and middle schools, even serve breakfast for free{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} to those who want to eat before school starts.  . 

There are a number of different [[List of universities in Sweden|universities and colleges in Sweden]], the oldest and largest of which are situated in [[Uppsala University|Uppsala]], [[Lund University|Lund]], [[University of Gothenburg|Gothenburg]] and [[Stockholm University|Stockholm]]. Only a few countries such as Canada, the United States, Japan and [[South Korea]] have higher levels of [[tertiary education]] degree holders.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}<!-- and what about non-oecd countries such as Russia and Israel? --> Along with several other European countries, the government also subsidises tuition of international students pursuing a degree at Swedish institutions, although a recent bill passed in the Swedish parliament will limit this subsidy to students from EEA countries and Switzerland. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studyinsweden.se/Home/News-archive/2010/Tuition-fees-from-2011/ |title=Sweden introduces tuition fees and offers scholarships for students from outside EU |date=2010-04-21 |publisher=Studyinsweden.se |accessdate=2010-08-03}}</ref> . 

===Immigration===. 
{{Main|Immigration to Sweden}}
[[File:Invandrare utvandrare Sverige 1850-2007.svg|400px|right|thumb|Immigrants and emigrants, Sweden 1850–2007]] . 

Immigration has been a major source of [[population growth]] and cultural change throughout much of the [[history of Sweden]]. Sweden has been transformed from a nation of [[emigration]] ending after World War I to a nation of [[immigration]] from World War II onwards. The economic, social, and political aspects of immigration have caused controversy regarding ethnicity, economic benefits, jobs for non-immigrants, settlement patterns, impact on upward [[social mobility]], crime, and voting behaviour.  . 

According to [[Eurostat]], in 2010, there were 1.33 million foreign-born residents in Sweden, corresponding to 14.3% of the total population. Of these, 859 000 (9.2%) were born outside the [[European Union|EU]] and 477 000 (5.1%) were born in another EU Member State. <ref>[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-11-034/EN/KS-SF-11-034-EN.PDF 6.5% of the EU population are foreigners and 9.4% are born abroad], Eurostat, Katya VASILEVA, 34/2011. </ref><ref name="scb%2525252525252Ese"/>

==Culture==. 
{{Main|Culture of Sweden}}
[[File:Nationalmuseum Stockholm.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Nationalmuseum]] in Stockholm.]]
Sweden has many authors of worldwide recognition including [[August Strindberg]], [[Astrid Lindgren]], and [[Nobel Prize]] winners [[Selma Lagerlöf]] and [[Harry Martinson]]. In total seven [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prizes in Literature]] have been awarded to Swedes. The nation's most well-known artists are painters such as [[Carl Larsson]] and [[Anders Zorn]], and the sculptors [[Tobias Sergel]] and [[Carl Milles]].  . 

Swedish 20th-century culture is noted by pioneering works in the early days of [[Film|cinema]], with [[Mauritz Stiller]] and [[Victor Sjöström]]. In the 1920s–1980s, the filmmaker [[Ingmar Bergman]] and actors [[Greta Garbo]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]] became internationally noted people within cinema. More recently, the films of [[Lukas Moodysson]] and [[Lasse Hallström]] have received international recognition.  . 

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s Sweden was seen as an international leader in what is now referred to as the "[[sexual revolution]]", with [[gender equality]] having particularly been promoted. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Lifestyle/Reading/The-Swedish-myths-True-false-or-somewhere-in-between/ |title=The Swedish Myths: True, False, or Somewhere In Between? |publisher=Sweden.se |accessdate=2011-01-27}}</ref> At the present time, the number of single people is one of the highest in the world. The early Swedish film ''[[I Am Curious (Yellow)]]'' (1967) reflected a liberal view of sexuality, including scenes of love making that caught international attention, and introduced the concept of the "Swedish sin".  . 

Sweden has also become very liberal towards [[homosexuality]], as is reflected in the popular acceptance of films such as ''[[Fucking Åmål|Show Me Love]]'', which is about two young [[lesbians]] in the small Swedish town of Åmål. Since 1 May 2009, Sweden repealed its "registered partnership" laws and fully replaced them with [[gender-neutral marriage]],

Sweden also offers [[domestic partnerships]] for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. Cohabitation (''sammanboende'') by couples of all ages, including teenagers as well as elderly couples, is widespread. Recently, Sweden is experiencing a baby boom. <ref>

{{Main|Music of Sweden}}
[[File:Abba 28011977 15 200.jpg|thumb|160px|left|[[Agnetha Fältskog]] of Swedish band [[ABBA]] performing in 1977.]]
Sweden has a rich musical tradition, ranging from mediaeval folk ballads to [[Swedish hip hop|hip hop music]]. The music of the pre-Christian Norse has been lost to history, although historical re-creations have been attempted based on instruments found in Viking sites. The instruments used were the ''[[lur]]'' (a sort of trumpet), simple string instruments, wooden flutes and drums. It is possible that the Viking musical legacy lives on in some of the old Swedish folk music. 
Sweden has a significant [[Music of Sweden|folk-music]] scene, both in the traditional style as well as more modern interpretations which often mix in elements of rock and jazz. [[Väsen]] is more of a traditionalist group, using a unique, traditional Swedish instrument called the ''[[nyckelharpa]]'' while [[Garmarna]], [[Nordman]] and [[Hedningarna]] have more modern elements. 
There is also [[Sami people|Sami]] music, called the ''[[joik]]'', which is actually a type of chant which is part of the traditional Saami animistic spirituality but has gained recognition in the international world of folk music. Sweden's most classic and notable composers includes [[Carl Michael Bellman]] and [[Franz Berwald]].  . 

Sweden also has a prominent choral music tradition, deriving in part from the cultural importance of Swedish folk songs. In fact, out of a population of 9.2 million, it is estimated that five to six hundred thousand people sing in choirs. <ref>Durant, Colin (2003). ''Choral Conducting: philosophy and practice'', Routledge, pp. 46–47. ISBN 0-415-94356-6: "Sweden has a strong and enviable choral singing tradition. [..] All those interviewed placed great emphasis on the social identification through singing and also referred to the importance of Swedish folk song in the maintenance of the choral singing tradition and national identity."</ref> . 

In 2007, with over 800 million dollars in revenue, Sweden was the third largest music exporter in the world and surpassed only by the US and the UK. <ref name="export music">{{cite web|url=http://www.swedenabroad.com/Page____59218.aspx |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080615001724/http://www.swedenabroad.com/Page____59218.aspx|archivedate=2010-05-05|title=Consulate General of Sweden Los Angeles – Export Music Sweden at MuseExpo |publisher=Swedenabroad.com |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>[http://casgroup.fiu.edu/pages/docs/551/1264626358_Interesting_Facts_about_EU_Countries.pdf Interesting facts about EU countries]. casgroup.fiu.edu</ref>{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} [[ABBA]] was one of the first internationally well-known popular music bands from Sweden, and still ranks among the [[List of best-selling music artists|most prominent bands in the world]], with about 370 million records sold. With ABBA, Sweden entered into a new era, in which Swedish pop music gained international prominence. 
[[File:GoteborgsOperan.jpg|thumb|left|195px|The [[GöteborgsOperan|Gothenburg Opera]].]]
There have been many other internationally successful bands since, such as [[Roxette]], [[Ace of Base]], [[Europe (band)|Europe]], [[A-teens]], [[The Cardigans]] and [[The Hives]], to name some of the biggest, and recently there has been a surge of Swedish [[Indie pop]] bands such as [[Loney, Dear]], [[Shout Out Louds]], [[The Radio Dept.]] and [[Dungen]], a group which incorporates many elements of Swedish traditional folk music in their sound. One of the biggest bands in Sweden is the rock band [[Kent (band)|Kent]].  . 

Sweden has also become known for a large number of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] (mostly [[death metal]] and [[melodic death metal]]) as well as [[progressive metal|progressive]]- and [[power metal]] bands. Some of the most popular being [[In Flames]], [[Amon Amarth]], [[HammerFall]], [[Pain of Salvation]], [[Dark Tranquillity]], [[Opeth]], [[Arch Enemy]] and [[Meshuggah]]. The renowned [[Neo-classical metal|neoclassical power metal]] guitarist [[Yngwie Malmsteen]] is also from Sweden.  . 

Sweden has a rather lively jazz scene. During the last sixty years or so it has attained a remarkably high artistic standard, stimulated by domestic as well as external influences and experiences. The Centre for Swedish Folk Music and Jazz Research has published an overview of jazz in Sweden by Lars Westin. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visarkiv.se/en/jazz/index.htm |title=Lars Westin: Jazz in Sweden – an overview |publisher=Visarkiv.se |accessdate=2010-08-25}}</ref> . 

===Architecture===. 
{{Main|Architecture of Sweden}}
[[File:Djurgardsbron 2008.jpg|left|thumb|188px|[[Djurgårdsbron]].]]
Before the 13th century most buildings were made of brick, but a shift began towards stone. Early Swedish stone buildings are the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] churches on the country side. As so happens, many of them were built in [[Scania]] and are in effect Danish churches. This would include the magnificent [[Lund Cathedral]] from the 11th century and the somewhat younger church in [[Dalby]], but also many early [[Gothic (architecture)|Gothic]] churches built through influences of the [[Hanseatic League]], such as in [[Ystad]], [[Malmö]] and [[Helsingborg]].  . 

[[Cathedral]]s in other parts of Sweden were also built as seats of Sweden's bishops. The [[Skara Cathedral]] is of [[brick]]s from the 14th century, and the [[Uppsala Cathedral]] in the 15th. In 1230 the foundations of the [[Linköping]] Cathedral were made, the material was there [[limestone]], but the building took some 250 years to finish.  . 

Among older structures are also some significant fortresses and other historical buildings such as at [[Borgholm Castle]], [[Halltorps Manor]] and [[Eketorp]] fortress on the island [[Öland]], the [[Nyköping]] fortress and the [[Visby]] ring wall.  . 

[[File:Kalmar.jpg|right|188px|thumb|The Kalmar Cathedral.]]
Around 1520 Sweden was out of the [[Middle Age]]s and united under King [[Gustav Vasa]], who immediately initiated grand mansions, castles and fortresses to be built. Some of the more magnificent include the [[Kalmar]] fortress, the [[Gripsholm Castle]] and the one at [[Vadstena]].  . 

In the next two centuries, Sweden was designated by [[Baroque architecture]] and later the [[rococo]]. Notable projects from that time include the city [[Karlskrona]], which has now also been declared a World Heritage Site and the [[Drottningholm Palace]].  . 

1930 was the year of the great Stockholm exhibition, which marked the breakthrough of [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]], or "funkis" as it became known. The style came to dominate in the following decades. Some notable projects of this kind were the [[Million Programme (Sweden)|Million Programme]], offering affordable but anti-human living in large apartment complexes.  . 

===Media===. 
{{Main|Media in Sweden}} . 

Swedes are among the greatest consumers of newspapers in the world, and nearly every town is served by a local paper. The country's main quality morning papers are [[Dagens Nyheter]] (liberal), [[Göteborgs-Posten]] (liberal), [[Svenska Dagbladet]] (liberal conservative) and [[Sydsvenska Dagbladet]] (liberal). The two largest evening [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]s are [[Aftonbladet]] (social democratic) and [[Expressen]] (liberal). The ad-financed, free international morning paper, [[Metro International]], was originally founded in Stockholm, Sweden. The country's news is reported in English by, among others, [[The Local]] (liberal).  . 

The public broadcasting companies held a monopoly on radio and television for a long time in Sweden. Licence funded radio broadcasts started in 1925. A second radio network was started in 1954 and a third opened 1962 in response to pirate radio stations. Non-profit [[Community_radio#Sweden|community radio]] was allowed in 1979 and in 1993 commercial local radio started.  . 

The licence funded television service was officially launched in 1956. A second channel, [[SVT2|TV2]], was launched in 1969. These two channels (operated by [[Sveriges Television]] since the late '70s) held a monopoly until the 1980s when cable and satellite television became available. The first Swedish language satellite service was [[TV3 (Sweden)|TV3]] which started broadcasting from London in 1987. It was followed by [[Kanal 5 (Sweden)|Kanal 5]] in 1989 (then known as Nordic Channel) and [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]] in 1990.  . 

In 1991 the government announced it would begin taking applications from private television companies wishing to broadcast on the [[terrestrial television|terrestrial network]]. TV4, which had previously been broadcasting via satellite, was granted a permit and began its terrestrial broadcasts in 1992, becoming the first private channel to broadcast television content from within the country.  . 

Around half the population are connected to cable television. [[Digital terrestrial television in Sweden]] started in 1999 and the last analogue terrestrial broadcasts were terminated in 2007.  . 

===Literature===. 
{{Main|Swedish literature}}
[[File:Portrait of August Strindberg by Richard Bergh 1905.jpg|upright|thumb|Writer and playwright [[August Strindberg]].]] . 

The first literary text from Sweden is the [[Rök Runestone]], carved during the [[Viking Age]] c. 800 AD. With the conversion of the land to Christianity around 1100 AD, Sweden entered the [[Middle Ages]], during which monastic writers preferred to use Latin. Therefore there are only a few texts in the [[Swedish language#Old Swedish|Old Swedish]] from that period. Swedish literature only flourished when the Swedish language was standardized in the 16th century, a standardization largely due to the full translation of the Bible into Swedish in 1541. This translation is the so-called [[Gustav Vasa Bible]].  . 

With improved education and the freedom brought by [[secularization]], the 17th century saw several notable authors develop the Swedish language further. Some key figures include [[Georg Stiernhielm]] (17th century), who was the first to write classical poetry in Swedish; [[Johan Henric Kellgren]] (18th century), the first to write fluent Swedish prose; [[Carl Michael Bellman]] (late 18th century), the first writer of [[burlesque]] ballads; and [[August Strindberg]] (late 19th century), a socio-realistic writer and playwright who won worldwide fame. The early 20th century continued to produce notable authors, such as [[Selma Lagerlöf]], ([[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel laureate]] 1909), [[Verner von Heidenstam]] (Nobel laureate 1916) and [[Pär Lagerkvist]] (Nobel laureate 1951).  . 

In recent decades, a handful of Swedish writers have established themselves internationally, including the detective novelist [[Henning Mankell]] and the writer of spy fiction [[Jan Guillou]]. The Swedish writer to have made the most lasting impression on world literature is the children's book writer [[Astrid Lindgren]], and her books about [[Pippi Longstocking]], [[Emil i Lönneberga|Emil]], and others. In 2008, the second best-selling fiction author in the world was [[Stieg Larsson]], whose ''Millennium'' series of crime novels is being published posthumously to critical acclaim. <ref>[http://www.abebooks.com/blog/index.php/2009/01/15/bestselling-fiction-authors-in-the-world-for-2008/ Bestselling fiction authors in the world for 2008], 15 January 2009, www.abebooks.com. Retrieved on 5 August 2009. </ref> Larsson drew heavily on the work of Lindgren by basing his central character, Lisbeth Salander, on Longstocking. <ref>[http://www.buzzle.com/articles/289825.html Poisoned Legacy Left By The King Of Thrillers], www.buzzle.com.

===Holidays===. 
{{Main|Public holidays in Sweden}}
[[File:Valborgsbrasa-1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walpurgis Night]] bonfire in Sweden.]]
Apart from traditional Protestant [[Liturgical year|Christian holidays]], Sweden also celebrates some unique holidays, some of a pre-Christian tradition. They include [[Midsummer]] celebrating the summer [[solstice]]; [[Walpurgis Night]] (''Valborgsmässoafton'') on 30 April lighting bonfires; and [[Labour Day]] or Mayday on 1 May is dedicated to socialist demonstrations. The day of giver-of-light [[Saint Lucy|Saint Lucia]], 13 December, is widely acknowledged in elaborate celebrations which betoken its Italian origin and commence the month-long Christmas season.  . 

6 June is the [[National holiday of Sweden|National Day of Sweden]] and, as of 2005, a public holiday. Furthermore, there are [[Flag days in Sweden|official flag day]] observances and a [[Namesdays in Sweden]] calendar. In August many Swedes have ''kräftskivor'' (crayfish dinner parties). [[Martin of Tours]] Eve is celebrated in [[Scania]] in November with ''Mårten Gås'' parties, where roast goose and ''[[svartsoppa]]'' ('black soup', made of goose stock, fruit, spices, spirits and goose blood) are served. The [[Sami people|Sami]], one of Sweden's indigenous minorities, have their holiday on 6 February and Scania celebrate their Scanian Flag day on the third Sunday in July.  . 

===Cuisine===. 
{{Main|Swedish cuisine}}
[[File:Knaeckebroed.jpg|thumb|180px|Swedish knäckebröd ([[crisp bread]]).]]
Swedish cuisine, like that of the other [[Scandinavia]]n countries ([[Cuisine of Denmark|Denmark]], [[Cuisine of Norway|Norway]] and [[Cuisine of Finland|Finland]]), was traditionally simple. [[Fish]] (particularly [[herring]]), [[meat]], [[potato]]es and [[dairy products]] played prominent roles. [[File:2005 baking of saffron buns 04.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Swedish saffron buns]] Spices were sparse. Famous dishes include Swedish meatballs, traditionally served with gravy, boiled potatoes and [[lingonberry jam]]; pancakes, ''[[lutefisk|lutfisk]]'', and [[Smörgåsbord]], or lavish buffet. ''[[Akvavit]]'' is a popular alcoholic [[distilled beverage]], and the drinking of ''[[snaps]]'' is of cultural importance. The traditional flat and dry [[crisp bread]] has developed into several contemporary variants. Regionally important foods are the ''[[surströmming]]'' (a fermented fish) in Northern Sweden and [[eel]] in [[Scania]] in Southern Sweden.  . 

Swedish traditional dishes, some of which are many hundreds of years old, others perhaps a century or less, are still a very important part of Swedish everyday meals, in spite of the fact that modern day Swedish cuisine adopts many [[international]] dishes.  . 

In August, at the traditional feast known as crayfish party, ''[[kräftskiva]]'', Swedes eat large amounts of boiled [[crayfish]] with boiled potato and dill.  . 

===Cinema===. 
{{Main|Cinema of Sweden}}
Swedes have been fairly prominent in the film area through the years, several successful Swedish Hollywood actors can be mentioned: [[Ingrid Bergman]], [[Greta Garbo]], [[Max von Sydow]], [[Dolph Lundgren]], [[Lena Olin]], [[Britt Ekland]], [[Maud Adams]], [[Stellan Skarsgård]], [[Peter Stormare]], [[Izabella Scorupco]], [[Pernilla August]], [[Ann-Margret]], [[Anita Ekberg]], [[Alexander Skarsgård]], [[Harriet Andersson]], [[Bibi Andersson]], [[Ingrid Thulin]], [[Malin Åkerman]] and [[Gunnar Björnstrand]]. Amongst several directors who have made internationally successful films can be mentioned: [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Lukas Moodysson]] and [[Lasse Hallström]].  . 

===Fashion===. 
Interest in fashion is big in Sweden and the country is headquartering famous brands like [[H&M|Hennes & Mauritz]] (operating as H&M), [[J. Lindeberg]] (operating as JL), [[Acne Jeans|Acne]], [[Gina Tricot]], [[Lindex]], [[Tiger of Sweden]], [[Odd Molly]], [[Cheap Monday]], [[Dr. Denim]], [[Gant U.S.A.|Gant]], [[Resteröds]], [[Nudie Jeans]], [[WESC]], [[WAX (clothing)|WAX]], [[Uniforms for the Dedicated]], [[Filippa K]], [[Nakkna]] and [[Fifth Avenue Shoe Repair]] within its borders. These companies, however, are composed largely of buyers who import fashionable goods from throughout Europe and America, continuing the trend of Swedish business toward multinational economic dependency like many of its neighbours.  . 

===Sports===.

In 2006, Tre Kronor became the first national hockey team to win both the Olympic and world championships in the same year. The [[Sweden national football team|Swedish national football team]] has seen some success at the World Cup in the past, finishing second when they hosted the tournament in 1958, and third twice, in 1950 and 1994. [[Track and field athletics|Athletics]] has enjoyed a surge in popularity due to several successful athletes in recent years, such as [[Carolina Klüft]] and [[Stefan Holm]].  . 

Sweden hosted the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] and the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]]. Other big sports events held here include [[1992 UEFA European Football Championship]], [[FIFA Women's World Cup 1995]], and several championships of [[ice hockey]], [[curling]], [[track and field athletics|athletics]], [[skiing]], [[bandy]], [[figure skating]] and [[swimming (sport)|swimming]].  .
