'''School choice''' is a term used to describe a wide array of programs aimed at giving families the opportunity to choose the school their children will attend. As a matter of form, school choice does not give preference to one form of schooling or another, rather manifests itself whenever a student attends school outside of the one they would have been assigned to by geographic default. The most common options offered by school choice programs are open enrollment laws that allow students to attend other [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]], [[private school]]s, [[charter school]]s, tax credit and deductions for expenses related to schooling, vouchers, and homeschooling.   In U.S. political discourse it refers exclusively to programs that would provide public funds to privately run schools, since parents already have the option of sending their child to the private school of their choice (within their economic means).  . 

==Forms==. 
=== Open enrollment === . 

[[Open enrollment]] also refers to educational policies which allow residents of a state to enroll their children in any public school, provided the school has not reached its maximum capacity number for students, regardless of the [[school district]] in which a family resides.  . 

=== Vouchers ===. 
{{main|School voucher}}
When the government pays tuition to a private school on behalf of the parents, this is usually referred to as a voucher.  A voucher is given to the family for them to spend at any school of their choice.  . 

=== Tuition tax credits ===. 
A tuition tax credit is similar to most other familiar tax credits. Certain states allow individuals and/or businesses to deduct a certain amount of their income taxes to donate to education. Depending on the program, these donations can either go to a public school or to a School Tuition Organization (STO), or both. The donations that go to public schools are often used to help pay for after-school programs, schools trips, or school supplies. The donations that go to School Tuition Organizations are used by the STO to create scholarships that are then given to students. These programs currently exist in Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. <ref name=heritage2005/> Arizona has probably the most well known and fastest growing tax credit program. In the Arizona School Tuition Organization Tax Credit program individuals can deduct up to $500 and couples filing joint returns can deduct up to $1000. About 20,000 children received scholarships in the 2003-2004 school year. And, since the program has started in 1998, over 77,000 scholarships have been granted. <ref name=heritage2005/> . 

In Iowa, the Educational Opportunities Act was signed into law in 2006, creating a pool of tax credits for eligible donors to student tuition organizations (STOs).  At first, these tax caps were $5 million but in 2007, Governor [[Chet Culver]] increased the total amount to $7.5 million. The [[Iowa Alliance for Choice in Education]] (Iowa ACE) oversees the STOs and advocates for school choice in Iowa.  . 

=== Charter schools ===. 
{{main|Charter school}}
Charter schools are public schools with more relaxed rules and regulations. These relaxed rules tend to deal with things like Teacher Union contracts and state curriculum. The majority of states (and the District of Columbia) have charter school laws. Minnesota was the first state to have a charter school law and the first charter school in the United States, City Academy, opened in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1992. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/05/04/education.debate/|title=Clinton touts success of public charter schools|date=2000-05-04|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=2008-08-27}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> . 

Dayton, Ohio has between 22–26% of all children in charter schools. <ref name="Elliot">{{cite web|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/dayton/education/entries/2005/12/02/index.html|title=Catholic schools: Victims of choice|last=Elliot|first=Scott|date=2005-12-02|publisher=Dayton Daily News|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref> This is the highest percentage in the nation. Other hotbeds for charter schools are Kansas City (24%), Washington, D.C. (20-24%) and the State of Arizona. Almost 1 in 4 public schools in Arizona are charter schools, comprising about 8% of total enrollment.  . 

Charter schools can also come in the form of Cyber Charters. Cyber charter schools deliver the majority of their instruction over the internet instead of in a school building. And, like charter schools, they are public schools, but free of many of the rules and regulations that public schools must follow.  . 

=== Magnet schools ===. 
{{main|Magnet school}}
Magnet schools are public schools that often have a specialized function like science, technology or art. These magnet schools, unlike charter schools, are not open to all children. Much like many private schools, there are some (but not all) magnet schools that require a test to get in.  . 

=== Home schooling ===. 
{{main|Homeschooling}}
When a child is educated at home, or is having his or her education instructed or directed primarily by a parent, then this is usually referred to as Home Education or [[Homeschooling|Home Schooling]]. Informal home Education has been around as long as human beings.  Formal instruction was also very popular; however, the number of people educated using a planned curriculum at home dropped as public education grew in popularity during the 1900s. In the last 20 years the number of children being formally educated at home has grown tremendously. The laws relevant to Home Education differ throughout the country. In some states the parent simply needs to notify the state that the child will be educated at home. In other states the parents are not free to educate at home unless at least one parent is a certified teacher and yearly progress reports are reviewed by the state. Such laws are not always enforced however. According to the Federal Government, about 1.1 million children were Home Educated in 2003. <ref name="nces.ed.gov">{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/nhes/homeschool/|title=1.1 Million Homeschooled Students in the United States in 2003|publisher=National Center for Education Statistics|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref> . 

== Support ==. 
The goal of school choice programs is to give parents more control over their child's education, and to allow parents to pursue the most appropriate learning environments for children. For example school choice may enable parents to choose a school that provides religious instruction for their children; stronger discipline; better foundational skills including reading, writing, mathematics, and science; everyday skills from handling money to farming, or other desirable foci. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} . 

Supporters of voucher models school choice argue that choice creates competition between schools for students. Schools that fail to attract students can be closed. Advocates of school choice argue that this competition for students (and the education dollars that come with them) create a catalyst for schools to create innovative programs, become more responsive to parental demands, and to increase student achievement. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} . 

Another argument in favor of school choice is based on cost-effectiveness. Studies undertaken by the [[Cato Institute]] and other [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] and [[conservative]] [[thinktanks]] conclude that privately run education usually costs between one quarter and one half of publicly run education while giving superior outcomes. <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/new/09-03/09-02-03r.html |title=$5000 School Vouchers Would Give Most Students Access to Quality Private Schools |date=2003-09-02 |accessdate=2008-08-27 |publisher=Cato Institute}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa486.pdf |format=PDF|title=What Does a Voucher Buy? |date=2003-08-28 |last=Salisbury |first=David |accessdate=2008-08-27 |publisher=Cato Institute}}</ref><ref name=Arizona>{{Cite web |url=http://www.heartland.org/Article.cfm?artId=16478 |title=Arizona Private Schools Half as Expensive as Public Schools |last=Murray |first=Vicki |publisher=The Heartland Institute |date=2005-03-01 |accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref><ref name=wapolicy>{{Cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpolicy.org/Centers/education/policynote/04_milewski_publiceducation.html |title=K-12 Public Education Spending in Washington |accessdate=2008-08-27 |publisher=Washington Policy}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  . 

Others argue that since children from impoverished families almost exclusively attend public schools, school choice programs would allow these students to opt out of bad schools and acquire a better education, thereby granting the decision-making power to students and their parents, not school administrators. Supporters say this would level the playing field by broadening opportunities for low-income students to attend as good of schools as the middle classes instead of the current two-tiered system which educates the middle and upper classes, but not the lower classes, particularly minorities. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040829-114519-1566r.htm|title=12 million languish in failing public schools, report says|date=2004-08-29|publisher=The Washington Times|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref> . 

The Organisation Internationale pour le Droit à l'Education et la Liberté d'Enseignement (OIDEL), a international [[non-profit organization]] for the development of [[freedom of education]], maintains that the [[right to education]] is a fundamental [[human right]] which cannot exist without the presence of State benefits and the protection of individual liberties. According to the organization, freedom of education notably implies the freedom for parents to choose a school for their children without discrimination on the basis of finances. To advance freedom of education, OIDEL promotes a greater parity between public and private schooling systems. <ref>{{cite web|title=OIDEL - A Presentation|url=http://www.oidel.ch/anglais/presentation/prospectus%20OIDEL%20anglais.pdf|publisher=Organisation Internationale pour le Droit à l'Education et la Liberté d'Enseignement|pages=1–2|format=Portable Document Format|accessdate=2009-04-18 |quote= }}</ref> . 

== Criticisms ==. 
[[Image:Charter School Performance Study.svg|thumb|250px|A study done by [[Stanford University]] found that charter schools on average perform about the same or worse compared to public schools.]] . 

Many opponents of school choice such as [[Martin Carnoy]] argue that public schools perform similarly to private schools when teaching similar groups of students, and that the conception of public schools as "failing" in comparison to private schools is more due to the demographic differences between public and private schools than to actual differences in the quality of the education the schools offer.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} "School choice" as it entails a switch from public to private schooling would therefore do little to solve the problems facing the educational system, since a private school would perform no better than a public school when faced with exactly the same student body.  . 

Opponents of school choice often object to the use of the term itself, viewing it as loaded political vocabulary.  . 

Opponents also argue that school choice in the form of vouchers could result in nothing more than a cash-handout for many middle-class and wealthy families already sending their kids to private schools, with disadvantaged families either unable to secure enrollment or unable to cover costs in addition to the vouchers. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4207/is_19950314/ai_n10188931|title=Expanding choice may cost more, hurt poor|last=Schultze|first=Steve|date=1995-03-14|publisher=The Milwaukee Journal|accessdate=2008-08-27}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Under voucher programs, private schools may be able to reject students who are expensive to educate due to special needs or students who they feel would disrupt the learning environment, and opponents of voucher programs argue that this would leave such students under a system of de facto segregation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} School choice opponents also charge that students who are unable, because of their parents' educational level or the lack of reliable transportation, to leave their local schools may be hurt as additional funding is cut from their schools. <ref>{{cite book|last=Betts|first=Julian R.|coauthors=Tom Loveless|title=Getting Choice Right|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|year=2005|isbn=0815753314}}</ref> . 

== International overview and major institutional options==. 
=== France ===. 
{{Main|Education in France}}
The [[France|French]] government subsidizes most private primary and secondary schools, including those affiliated with religious denominations, under contracts stipulating that education must follow the same curriculum as public schools and that schools cannot discriminate on grounds of religion or force pupils to attend religion classes.  . 

This system of ''école libre'' (Free Schooling) is mostly used not for religious reasons, but for practical reasons (private schools may offer more services, such as after-class tutoring) as well as the desire of parents living in disenfranchised areas to send their children away from the local schools, where they perceive that the youth are too prone to delinquency or have too many difficulties keeping up with schooling requirements that the educational content is bound to suffer. The threatened repealing of that status in the 1980s triggered mass street demonstrations in favor of the status. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} . 

=== Sweden ===. 
{{Main|Education in Sweden}}
Sweden enacted school choice in 1992. <ref name="The Economist">{{Cite web | title = Free to choose, and learn | publisher = The Economist | date = 2007-05-03 | url = http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9119786 | accessdate = 2010-11-29}}</ref> Its school choice system is one of the freest in the world, allowing students to use state funding for the public or private school of their choice, including religious and for-profit schools. <ref name="The Economist"/> In the fifteen years after enactment, private school enrollment increased from 1% to 10% of the student population. <ref name="The Economist"/> . 

=== Canada ===. 
{{Main|Education in Canada}}
[[Ontario]] is the only large province in [[Canada]] with limited  school choice funding, Catholic, Secular and one Protestant school receive funding and are open to all students.  In 2003, following an international human rights ruling,  the provincial Conservative government gradually introduced a tax credit over 5 years, (when it would have been fully implemented it would have been worth up to 50% of tuition to a maximum of $3,500 at any independent school in Ontario) in order to meet the human rights norms and expand funded choice to all interested parents.  However, the tax credit was retroactively canceled by the subsequent Liberal government when it had been only been in place for two years to the $1,000 point. Currently there are over 900 independent schools in Ontario.  The only school choice program available to  non-rich parents who   wish to send their children to an independent school is a privately funded program called [http://www.childrenfirstgrants.ca Children First], a program of [[Fraser Institute|The Fraser Institute]].  . 

=== Chile ===. 
{{Main|Education in Chile}}
In [[Chile]], there is an extensive voucher system in which the state pays private and municipal schools directly, based on average attendance (90% of the country students utilize such a system). The result has been a steady increase in the number and recruitment of private schools that show consistently better results in [[standardized test]]ing than municipal schools. The reduction of students in municipal schools has gone from 78% of all students in 1981, to 57% in 1990, and to less than 50% in 2005.  . 

Regarding vouchers in Chile, researchers have found that when controls for the student's background (parental income and education) are introduced, the difference in performance between public and private subsectors is not significant. <ref>{{cite journal|last=McEwan|first=Patrick J.|coauthors=Martin Carnoy|date=Fall 2000|title=The Effectiveness and Efficiency of Private Schools in Chile's Voucher System|journal=Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis|volume=22|issue=3|pages=213–239|doi=10.3102/01623737022003213}}</ref> There is also greater variation within each subsector than between the two systems. <ref>{{cite book|last=Mizala|first=Alejandra |coauthors=Pilar Romaguera|title=Determinación de Factores Explicativos de los Resultados Escolares en Educación Media en Chile|publisher=Centre for Applied Economics, Department of Industrial Engineering, Faculty of Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Chile|month=August | year=2000|series=Economy Series No. 85}}</ref> . 

=== United States === . 

A variety of forms of school choice exist in the United States.  . 

====Vouchers==== . 

Vouchers currently exist in Wisconsin, Cleveland, Florida, and, most recently, the District of Columbia<ref name=heritage2005>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/Education/bg1848.cfm|title=Choices in Education: 2005 Progress Report|last=Kafer|first=Krista|date=2005-04-25|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref> and Georgia. The largest and oldest Voucher program is in Milwaukee. Started in 1990, and expanded in 1995, it currently allows no more than 15% of the district's public school enrollment to use vouchers. As of 2005 over 14,000 students use vouchers and they are nearing the 15% cap. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/Education/SchoolChoice/Wisconsin.cfm|title=School Choice - Wisconsin|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref> School vouchers are legally controversial in some states; in 2005 the Florida Supreme Court found that school vouchers were unconstitutional under the Florida Constitution. (Cite?) . 

In the U.S., the legal and moral precedents for vouchers may have been set by the [[G. I. Bill of Rights|G.I. bill]], which includes a voucher program for university-level education of veterans. The G.I. bill permits veterans to take their educational benefits at religious schools, an extremely divisive issue when applied to primary and secondary schools.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} . 

In ''[[Zelman v. Simmons-Harris]]'', 536 U.S. 639 (2002), the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that school vouchers could be used to pay for education in sectarian schools without violating the Establishment Clause of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. As a result, states are basically free to enact voucher programs that provide funding for any school of the parent's choosing.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} . 

The Supreme Court has not decided, however, whether states can provide vouchers for secular schools only, excluding sectarian schools. Proponents of funding for parochial schools argue that such an exclusion would violate the free exercise clause. However, in ''[[Locke v. Davey]]'', 540 U.S. 712 (2004), the Court held that states could exclude majors in "devotional theology" from an otherwise generally available college scholarship. The Court has not indicated, however, whether this holding extends to the public school context, and it may well be limited to the context of individuals training to enter the ministry.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} . 

====Tuition tax credits====. 
Tuition tax credit programs currently exist in Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and recently Georgia. Representative David Casas was responsible for passing the Georgia version of the school choice legislation. <ref>http://www.legis.state.ga.us/legis/2007_08/sum/hb1133.htm</ref> Arizona has probably the most well known and fastest growing tax credit program. In the Arizona School Tuition Organization Tax Credit program individuals can deduct up to $500 and couples filing joint returns can deduct up to $1000. About 20,000 children received scholarships in the 2003-2004 school year. And, since the program has started in 1998, over 77,000 scholarships have been granted. <ref name=heritage2005/> . 

The program was challenged in court by a group of Arizona taxpayers on the grounds that the tax credit violated the First Amendment because the tuition grants could go to students who attend private schools including schools with religious affiliations. <ref name=scotus>Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn et al. 987 U.S. 9 (2011)</ref>   Typically, taxpayers are not allowed to bring suit against the government regarding how taxes are spent because injury would be purely speculative.  The Court ruled 5-4 to let the tax credit program stand <ref name=scotus/>  In April 2011, a Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind poll found that a majority of American voters (60%) felt that the tax credits support school choice for parents whereas 26% felt as it the tax credits support religion. <ref name=FDU>[[Fairleigh Dickinson University]] PublicMind Poll [http://publicmind.fdu.edu/2011/taxcredits/ “Public Blesses Arizona Christian School Tuition”] press release (April 4, 2011)</ref> . 

====Charter schools====. 
The majority of states (and the District of Columbia) have charter school laws. Minnesota was the first state to have a charter school law and the first charter school in the United States, City Academy, opened in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1992. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/05/04/education.debate/|title=Clinton touts success of public charter schools|date=2000-05-04|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=2008-08-27}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> . 

Dayton, Ohio has between 22–26% of all children in charter schools. <ref name="Elliot"/> This is the highest percentage in the nation. Other hotbeds for charter schools are Kansas City (24%), Washington, D.C. (20-24%) and the State of Arizona. Almost 1 in 4 public schools in Arizona are charter schools, comprising about 8% of total enrollment.  . 

Charter schools can also come in the form of Cyber Charters. Cyber charter schools deliver the majority of their instruction over the internet instead of in a school building. And, like charter schools, they are public schools, but free of many of the rules and regulations that public schools must follow.  . 

====Magnet schools====. 
{{main|Magnet school}}
Magnet schools are public schools that often have a specialized function like science, technology or art. These magnet schools, unlike charter schools, are not open to all children. Much like many private schools, the students must test into the school.  . 

====Home schooling====. 
{{main|Homeschooling}}
The laws relevant to homeschooling differ between US states. In some states the parent simply needs to notify the state that the child will be educated at home. In other states the parents are not free to educate at home unless at least one parent is a certified teacher and yearly progress reports are reviewed by the state. Such laws are not always enforced however. According to the Federal Government, about 1.1 million children were Home Educated in 2003. <ref name="nces.ed.gov"/> . 

====College====. 
The United States has school choice at the university level. College students can get subsidized tuition by attending ''any'' public college or university within their state of residence. Furthermore, the U.S. federal government provides tuition assistance for both public and private colleges via the [[G.I. Bill]] and federally guaranteed [[student loans]].  .
