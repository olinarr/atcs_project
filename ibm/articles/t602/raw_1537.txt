A '''school voucher''', also called an '''education voucher''', is a certificate issued by the government, which parents can apply toward tuition at a private school (or, by extension, to reimburse home schooling expenses), rather than at the [[state school]] to which their child is assigned. An alternative to the education voucher is the '''education tax credit''', which allows individuals to use their own money to pay for the education of their children or to donate money towards the education of other children.       . 

Under non-voucher education systems, people who currently pay for private schooling are still taxed for public schools; therefore, they fund both public and private schools simultaneously. Via offsetting the cost of private school tuition, vouchers and tax credits are intended to allow students and families to choose the school that best fits their needs.  Opponents of school vouchers say allowing families the option of both public and private schools undermines the public education system through threatening its funding and enrollment. <ref>{{cite web|author=Erica Cordova |url=http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid=12942 |title=School Choice: Vouchers |publisher=Ncsl.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-11}}</ref> . 

==History==. 
The oldest continuing school voucher programs existing today in the United States are the Town Tuitioning programs in Vermont and Maine, beginning in 1869<ref name=Vermont>{{cite web|url= http://www.friedmanfoundation.org/friedman/schoolchoice/ShowProgramItem.do?id=32|title=Friedman Foundation - Vermont: Town Tuitioning Program}}</ref> and 1873<ref name=maine>{{cite web|url=http://www.friedmanfoundation.org/friedman/schoolchoice/ShowProgramItem.do?id=23|title=Friedman Foundation - Maine: Town Tuitioning Program}}</ref> respectively. Because some towns in these states operate neither local high schools nor elementary schools, students in these towns "are eligible for a voucher to attend [either] public schools in other towns or non-religious private schools. In these cases, the 'sending' towns pay tuition directly to the 'receiving' schools."<ref name=Vermont/><ref name=maine/> . 

A system of educational vouchers was introduced in the Netherlands in 1917. Today, more than 70% of pupils attend privately run but publicly funded schools, mostly split along denominational lines. <ref name="RDV 1997">{{cite journal |journal=Economics of Education Review |volume=16 |issue=3 |month=June |year=1997 |pages=329–335 |doi=10.1016/S0272-7757(96)00078-7 |title=School finance and school choice in the Netherlands |author=Jozef M. M. Ritzen, Jan van Dommelen and Frans J. De Vijlder}}</ref> . 

Nobel Prize winning economist [[Milton Friedman]] argued for the modern concept of vouchers in the 1950s, stating that competition would improve schools and cost efficiency.  The view further gained popularity with the 1980 TV broadcast of Friedman's series ''[[Free to Choose]]'' for which volume 6 was devoted entirely to promoting "educational freedom" through programs like school vouchers. <ref>[http://www.ideachannel.tv/ See Volume 6 - "What's Wrong with our Schools"]</ref> . 

In some Southern states during the 1960s, school vouchers were used as a method of perpetuating segregation. In a few instances, public schools were closed outright and vouchers were issued to parents. The vouchers, in many cases, were only good at privately segregated schools, known as segregation academies. <ref>{{cite web|last=Vergakis |first=Brock |url=http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,660226540,00.html |title=Deseret Morning News - Do vouchers equal segregation? |publisher=Deseretnews.com |date=2007-06-04 |accessdate=2011-08-11}}</ref> Today, all modern voucher programs prohibit racial discrimination.  . 

==Definitions==. 
There are important distinctions between different school choice options. 
* [[state school|Public school]]s operate publicly and are funded by [[taxation|taxes]]. 
* [[Private school]]s operate privately and are funded by private money such as [[tuition]] or donations. 
* '''School vouchers''' are subsidies given directly to parents for tuition at any school (these can be for any private school and are not themselves a separate type of school). There is no such thing as a separate "voucher school". 
* [[Charter school]]s are publicly funded schools which operate in the [[public sector]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscharterschools.org |title=US Charter Schools Home |publisher=Uscharterschools.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-11}}</ref> but are free from many of the regulations that apply to traditional public schools. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publicschoolreview.com/articles/3 |title=What is a Charter School? |publisher=Public School Review |date=2007-12-04 |accessdate=2011-08-11}}</ref>
* [[Open enrollment]] is the process of allowing parents to choose which public school their child attends instead of being assigned one (provided the school has not reached its maximum capacity number for students). This is sometimes confused with vouchers as a promotion for [[school choice]]. 
* Education tax credits:<ref>{{cite book|last=Welner|first=Kevin|title=[http://www.rowmanlittlefield.com/Catalog/SingleBook.shtml?command=Search&db=%5EDB/CATALOG.db&eqSKUdata=0742540790&thepassedurl=%5Bthepassedurl%5D NeoVouchers: The Emergence of Tuition Tax Credits for Private Schooling]|year=2008|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers}}</ref> There are two types of education tax credits: personal use, and donation.  Personal use tax credits are tax credits given to individual taxpayers for education expenditures made on behalf of their own children.  Donation tax credits are tax credits given to individual taxpayers or businesses  who donate to nonprofit organizations that give out private school scholarships to low income families.  These two types of tax credits can easily be combined to cover all families—from low income up—in a comprehensive tax credit program.  . 

==Controversy==. 
{{Globalize/USA|date=December 2010}} . 

===Proponents===. 
{{Chicago school (economics)}} . 

Proponents assert that school voucher and education tax credit systems promote [[free market]] competition among both private and public schools. By allowing parents and students to "vote with their feet," they incentivize schools to increase accountability and school performance. <ref>http://mises.org/media/2349/Roads-Education-and-Waterways-The-Case-Against-Public-Services</ref> . 

Proponents argue that the competition spurred by vouchers and education tax credits increases the quality of both eligible private schools and local public schools, the latter of which must improve in order to maintain enrollment. This argument is supported by studies such as "When Schools Compete: The Effects of Vouchers on Florida Public School Achievement" (Manhattan Institute for Policy Research's, 2003), which concluded that public schools located near private schools that were eligible to accept voucher students made significantly more improvements than did similar schools not located near eligible private schools. Stanford's C.M. Hoxby, who has researched the systemic effects of school choice, determined that areas with greater residential school choice have consistently higher test scores at a lower per-pupil cost than areas with very few school districts (see Hoxby, 1998).  Hoxby found that the effects of vouchers in Milwaukee and of charter schools in Arizona and Michigan on nearby public schools forced to compete made greater test score gains than schools not faced with such competition (see Hoxby, 2001), and that the so-called effect of [[cream skimming]] did not exist in any of the voucher districts examined. Hoxby's research has found that both private and public schools improved through the use of vouchers. <ref>Hoxby, Caroline, “Rising Tide” Education Next, Winter, 2001. </ref><ref>Hoxby, Caroline “Analyzing School Choice Reforms that Use America’s Traditional Forms of Parental Choice” in Paul E.

[[Friedrich von Hayek]] on the privatizing of education: . 

{{quote|As has been shown by Professor Milton Friedman (M. Friedman, The role of government in education, 1955), it would now be entirely practicable to defray the costs of general education out of the public purse without maintaining government schools, by giving the parents vouchers covering the cost of education of each child which they could hand over to schools of their choice. It may still be desirable that government directly provide schools in a few isolated communities where the number of children is too small (and the average cost of education therefore too high) for privately run schools. But with respect to the great majority of the population, it would undoubtedly be possible to leave the organization and management of education entirely to private efforts, with the government providing merely the basic finance and ensuring a minimum standard for all schools where the vouchers could be spent. (F. A. Hayek, The Constitution of Liberty, section 24.3)}} .

The Friedman [[Foundation for Educational Choice]], founded by Milton and Rose Friedman in 1996, is a non-profit organization that promotes universal school vouchers and other forms of school choice. In defense of vouchers, it cites empirical research showing that students who were randomly assigned to receive vouchers had higher academic outcomes than students who applied for vouchers but lost a random lottery and did not receive them; and that vouchers improve academic outcomes at public schools, reduce racial segregation, deliver better services to special education students, and do not drain money from public schools. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.friedmanfoundation.org/friedman/downloadFile.do?id=255 |title=Forster, Greg.

The main controversy over both school vouchers and education tax credits is that they put public education in direct competition with private education, threatening to reduce and reallocate public school funding to private schools.  . 

===Opponents===. 
[[Jonathan Kozol]], a former public school teacher and prominent public school reform thinker has called vouchers the "single worst, most dangerous idea to have entered education discourse in my adult life."<ref>Lisa Kaiser, "[http://www.expressmilwaukee.com/article-5728-an-interview-with-educator-and-activist-jonathan-kozol.html An Interview with Educator and Activist Jonathan Kozol]", March 4, 2009, Express Milwaukee.com</ref> Other public school teachers and teacher unions have also fought against school vouchers. In the United States, public school teacher unions,<ref>{{cite web|last=Bender |first=Michael C. |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/state/content/state/epaper/2008/06/13/0613constitutionalamendments.html |title=Local News: West Palm Beach, Palm Beach County, Martin & St. Lucie Counties |publisher=The Palm Beach Post |date=2008-06-13 |accessdate=2011-08-11}}</ref> most notably the [[National Education Association]] (the largest labor union in the USA), argue against the idea of school vouchers for concern that it would erode educational standards and reduce funding, and that giving money to parents who choose to send their child to a religious or other school is unconstitutional; however, the latter issue has been struck down by the [[Supreme Court]] case [[Zelman v. Simmons-Harris]], which upheld Ohio's voucher plan in a 5-4 ruling. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryindex.com/pages/1661/Getting-an-Education-VOUCHER-CONTROVERSY.html |title=Getting an Education - The Voucher Controversy - School, Public, Schools, Charter, Private, and Vouchers |publisher=Libraryindex.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/home/16378.htm |title=Vouchers |publisher=NEA |date=2008-10-30 |accessdate=2011-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/home/19133.htm |title=List of NEA beliefs and legal fights against vouchers |publisher=Nea.org |date=2008-11-13 |accessdate=2011-08-11}}</ref>  . 

In 2006, the [[United States Department of Education]] released a report concluding that average test scores for reading and mathematics, when adjusted for student and school characteristics, tend to be very similar among public schools and private schools.  If results were left unadjusted for factors such as race, gender, and free or reduced price lunch program eligibility, private schools performed significantly better than public schools. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2006461 |title=Comparing Private Schools and Public Schools Using Hierarchical Linear Modeling |publisher=Nces.ed.gov |date=2006-07-14 |accessdate=2011-08-11}}</ref> . 

Given the limited budget for schools, it is claimed that a voucher system would weaken public schools while at the same time not necessarily providing enough money for people to attend [[private school]]s. According to the [[National Conference of State Legislatures]], 76% of the money handed out for Arizona’s voucher program has gone to children already in private schools. <ref>{{cite book | last=Palast | first=Greg | title=Armed Madhouse (No Child's Behind Left) | url=http://www.gregpalast.com/no-childs-behind-left/ | publisher=Dutton Adult | year=2006 | isbn=0525949682}}</ref></ref> . 

Some sources claim that public schools' higher per pupil spending is due to having a higher proportion of students with behavioral, physical and emotional problems. They argue that some, if not all, of the cost difference between public and private schools comes from a process known as [[cream skimming]]--selecting only those students that belong to a preferred economic, religious, or ethnic group—rather than from differences in administration. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/briefs/bp-025.html |title=What Would A School Voucher Buy The Real Cost Of Private Schools |publisher=Cato.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://economics.about.com/b/2007/10/28/are-private-schools-more-cost-effective-than-public-ones.htm |title=Are Private Schools More Cost Effective Than Public Ones? |publisher=Economics.about.com |date=2007-10-28 |accessdate=2011-08-11}}</ref>  . 

In the United States, public schools must by law accept any student regardless of race, gender, religion, disability, etc. Thus, it has been argued that a voucher system would lead students who do not belong to a preferred religious or ethnic group, or those with disabilities, to become concentrated within the public school system. <ref>{{cite news|title=The Gifted Children Left Behind |author=Susan Goodkin and David G. Gold |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=2007-08-27 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/26/AR2007082600909.html |accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref> Of the ten existing voucher programs, however, four are targeted to low-income students, two are targeted to students in failing schools, and six are targeted to students with special needs. <ref>{{cite report| last=Campanella | first=Andrew | title=Hope for America's Children (School Choice Yearbook 2010-11) | url=http://www.allianceforschoolchoice.org/ResearchResources/#APR_3 | publisher=Alliance for School Choice | year=2011 }}</ref> . 

Another argument against the implementation of a school voucher system is its lack of accountability to the taxpayer. In many states, members of a community's board of education are elected by voters. Similarly, a school budget faces a referendum. Meetings of the Board of Education must be announced in advance, and members of the public are permitted to voice their concerns directly to board members. Although vouchers may be used in private and religious schools, taxpayers are not able to vote on budgetary issues, elect members of the board or even attend board meetings. [[Kevin G. Welner|Kevin Welner]] points out that vouchers funded through a convoluted tax credit system—a policy he calls "Neovouchers"-- present additional accountability concerns. With neovoucher systems, a taxpayer owing money to the state instead donates that money to a private, nonprofit organization. That organization then bundles donations and gives them to parents as vouchers to be used for private school tuition. The state then steps in and forgives (through a tax credit) some or all of the taxes that the donor has given to the organization. While conventional tax credit systems are structured to treat all private school participants equally, neovoucher systems effectively delegate to individual private taxpayers (those owing money to the state) the power to decide which private schools will benefit. <ref>See Welner, Kevin G. (2008) [http://www.rowmanlittlefield.com/Catalog/SingleBook.shtml?command=Search&db=%5EDB/CATALOG.db&eqSKUdata=0742540790&thepassedurl=%5Bthepassedurl%5D NeoVouchers: The Emergence of Tuition Tax Credits for Private Schooling]. Rowman & Littlefield Publishers</ref> . 

Some factions of [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] opponents in the U.S. object to vouchers on the grounds that granting government money, even indirectly, to private and religious schools will inevitably lead to increased governmental control over non-government education, and possibly over the teachings of the sponsoring religious group (most often a church). Some individuals who oppose vouchers on these grounds call for the abolition of all state sponsorship of education. The Alliance for the Separation of School & State opposes education vouchers on the grounds that "if vouchers become commonplace, private and religious schools will become more and more like public schools."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.honestedu.org/misc/vouchers.php|title=What about tax-funded vouchers, tax credits, and charter schools?|accessdate=2006-04-21}}</ref> Moreover, they suggest that if it is wrong in principle for the government to tax in order to fund public education, then one should not accept any portion of the ill-gotten money to fund private education. <ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.credenda.org/issues/10-3magistralis.php |title=Voucher Envy |author=[[N.

According to Susanne Wiborg, an expert on comparative education, Sweden's voucher system introduced in 1992 has "augmented social and ethnic segregation, particularly in relation to schools in deprived areas". <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-10725724 |title=Free schools 'could widen social divide' |first=Hannah |last=Richardson |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]] |date=22 July 2010}}</ref> . 

==Implementations==. 
===Chile===. 
In [[Chile]], there is an extensive voucher system in which the State pays private and municipal schools directly based on student attendance. This system covers nearly 90% of its students. It was introduced in 1981. <ref>{{cite journal |title=National Voucher Plans in Chile and Sweden: Did Privatization Reforms Make for Better Education? |first=Martin |last=Carnoy |journal=Comparative Education Review |volume=42 |issue=3 |month=August |year=1998 |pages=309–337 |jstor=1189163 |doi=10.1086/447510}}</ref> Dr. Martin Carnoy of Stanford, Patrick J. McEwan claims that based on his research, when controls for the student's background (parental income and education) are introduced, the difference in performance between public and private subsectors is not significant. <ref>''Does Privatization Improve Education? The Case of Chile's National Voucher Plan'' by Martin Carnoy and Patrick J. McEwan</ref> The voucher system in Chile has been controversial and has led to periodic mass protests, especially the 2006 [[Penguin Revolution]] and the [[2011 student protests in Chile]].  . 

===Europe===. 
In most European countries, education for all primary and secondary schools is fully subsidized. In some countries (e.g. Belgium), parents are free to choose which school their child attends.  . 

====Ireland====. 
Most schools in Ireland are state-aided parish schools, established under diocesan patronage but with capital costs, teachers salaries and a per head fee paid to the school. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.education.ie/home/home.jsp?maincat=&pcategory=17216&ecategory=20658&sectionpage=12251&language=EN&link=link001&page=1&doc=18626 |title=Irish Government Department of Education website'&#39; |publisher=Education.ie |date= |accessdate=2011-08-11}}</ref> These are given to the school regardless of whether or not it requires its students to pay fees. (Although fee-paying schools are in the minority, there has been much criticism over the state aid they receive with opponents claiming this gives them an unfair advantage.) . 

There is a recent trend towards multi-denominational schools established by parents, which are organised as limited companies without share capital. Parents and students are free to choose their own school. In the event of a school failing to attract students it immediately loses its per-head fee and over time loses its teaching posts- and teachers are moved to other schools which are attracting students. The system is perceived to have achieved very successful outcomes for most Irish children. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/35/44/38574871.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Irish report 02_04_07.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-08-11}}</ref> . 

The 1995-7 Rainbow Coalition (which contained parties of the centre right and the left) introduced free third-level education to primary degree level. Critics of the latter development charge that it has not increased the number of students from economically deprived backgrounds attending university. However, studies have shown that the removal of tuition fees at third level has increased the number of students overall and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This concurs with evidence from the UK of a decrease in attendance numbers after the introduction of fees. However, since the economic crisis, there has been extensive talk and debate regarding the reintroduction of third-level fees.  .

====Sweden====. 
{{Further|Education in Sweden}}
In [[Sweden]], the 1991-1994 centre-right government under [[Carl Bildt]] introduced a voucher system at primary and secondary school level, enabling free choice among public and charter schools (''friskolor'') in the community.  . 

The voucher is 'virtual' and worth the average cost for a place at a public school. Restrictions prevent charter schools from charging top-up fees or selecting students, ensuring equality of access. <ref>{{cite news|last=Baker |first=Mike |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/3717744.stm |title=UK &#124; Education &#124; Swedish parents enjoy school choice |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-10-05 |accessdate=2011-08-11}}</ref> No user fees are involved.

====Netherlands====. 
{{Further|Education in the Netherlands}}
In the Netherlands, the "[[school struggle]]" (''schoolstrijd'') concluded in 1917 with public and private schools being given equal financial status under the constitution,<ref name="RDV 1997"/> leading to a ''de facto'' system of school vouchers. <ref>{{cite journal |jstor=1187188 |title=Benefits and Costs of Privatized Public Services: Lessons from the Dutch Educational System |first=Estelle |last=James |journal=Comparative Education Review |volume=28 |issue=4 |month=November |year=1984 |pages=605–624 |doi=10.1086/446470}}</ref> For more than 80 years, parents have preferred independent schools. Today, around 70% of primary and secondary pupils attend independent schools. <ref name="FCPP-Netherlands">{{cite web|publisher=The Frontier Centre for Public Policy|url=http://www.fcpp.org/pdf/FB16%20Dutch%20School%20Model.pdf|title=The public school market in the Netherlands - Money Follows the Child}}</ref> . 

In the Netherlands, the government funds [[Special school (Netherlands)|"bijzondere" ("special") schools]], which are run by independent non-profit boards, on the condition that they charge no more tuition than public schools do and otherwise abide by practically the same rules as public schools. Parents are free to choose any public or special school for their children, although in some urban areas, such as Amsterdam, admissions procedures do exist. Many, but not all, special schools are religious in nature. The system arose after a prolonged political battle between religious and secular political parties, and is considered a political [[third rail (metaphor)|third rail]] even today. The emergence of Islamic schools is putting the issue back into the spotlight, though. Any voucher proposals in the Netherlands, and countries with similar systems such as [[Belgium]], are complicated by the historical background of the "school struggle". For a more detailed discussion, see Hooker in 'Bibliography'.  . 

===Hong Kong===. 
A voucher system for children three to six years-old who attend a non-profit [[kindergarten]] was implemented in [[Hong Kong]] in 2007. Each child will get HK$13,000 pa. The $13,000 subsidy will be separated into two parts. $10,000 is used to subsidize the school fee and the remaining $3,000 is used for kindergarten teachers to pursue further education and obtain a certificate in Education. Also, there are some restrictions on the voucher system. Parents can only choose those non-profit making with yearly fee less than $24,000. The government hopes that all kindergarten teachers can obtain an Education certificate by the year 2011-2012, at which point the subsidies are to be adjusted to $16000 for each student, all of which will go toward the school fee.  . 

[[Milton Friedman]] criticised the system, saying "I do not believe that <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|CE]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> Mr. Tsang's proposal is properly structured." He said that the whole point of a voucher system is to provide a competitive market place so should not be limited to non-profit kindergartens. <!--source: ming pao news
2006 11 13--> . 

After protests by parents with children enrolled in for profit kindergartens, the program was extended to children in for- profit kindergartens, but only for children enrolled in or before September 2007. The government will also provide up to HK$30,000 subsidy to for profit kindergartens wanting to convert to non profit.  . 

===United States===. 
====Introduction====. 
In the 1980s, the Reagan administration pushed for vouchers, as did the George W. Bush administration in the initial education-reform proposals leading up to the [[No Child Left Behind Act]]. This year, it is estimated that nearly 171,000 students will participate in 18 existing school choice programs in 10 states and the District of Columbia. Most of these programs are offered to students in low-income families, low performing schools, or special-education programs.  . 

The city of [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] led the way in 1990 and now has nearly 15,000 students using vouchers. The 2006-2007 school year will mark the first time in Milwaukee that more than $100 million will be paid in vouchers. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=533306|title=Vouchers to Pass $100 Million Mark, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, November 21, 2006|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> Twenty-six percent of Milwaukee students will receive public funding to attend schools outside the traditional Milwaukee Public School system. In fact, if the voucher program alone were considered a school district, it would mark the sixth-largest district in Wisconsin.  [[St. Anthony High School (Milwaukee)|St. Anthony Catholic School]], located on Milwaukee's south side, boasts 966 voucher students, meaning that it very likely receives more public money for general school support of a parochial elementary or high school than any before it in American history. Under the current state formula for paying school vouchers, however, Milwaukee residents pay more in property taxes for voucher students than for students attending public schools. This imbalance has received considerable criticism, and is the subject of 2007 legislative proposals designed to alter the formula.  . 

====Legal challenges====. 
The school voucher question in the United States has also received a considerable amount of judicial review in the early 2000s.  . 

A program launched in the city of [[Cleveland]] in 1995 and authorized by the state of [[Ohio]] was challenged in court on the grounds that it violated both the federal constitutional principle of separation of church and state and the guarantee of religious liberty in the [[Ohio Constitution]]. These claims were rejected by the [[Ohio Supreme Court]], but the federal claims were upheld by [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio|the local federal district court]] and by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth Circuit appeals court]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://edreform.com/school_choice/supreme_court_ruling.htm|title=Legal Summary of U.S. Supreme Court decision in Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 436 U.S.|accessdate=2006-04-21}}</ref> The fact that nearly all of the families using vouchers attended Catholic schools in the Cleveland area was cited in the decisions. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/06/27/scotus.school.vouchers/|accessdate=2006-04-21|title=Supreme Court affirms school voucher program|first=Terry|last=Friden|date=July 27, 2002 | work=CNN}}</ref> . 

This was later reversed during 2002 in a landmark case before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]], [[Zelman v. Simmons-Harris]], in which the divided court, in a 5-4 decision, ruled the Ohio school voucher plan constitutional and removed any constitutional barriers to similar voucher plans in the future, with moderate justices Anthony Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Connor and conservative justices William Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas in the majority.  . 

[[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[William Rehnquist]], writing for the majority, stated that "The incidental advancement of a religious mission, or the perceived endorsement of a religious message, is reasonably attributable to the individual aid recipients not the government, whose role ends with the disbursement of benefits." The Supreme Court ruled that the Ohio program did not violate the Establishment Clause, because it passed a five part test developed by the Court in this case, titled the Private Choice Test.  . 

Dissenting opinions included Justice Stevens's, who wrote "...the voluntary character of the private choice to prefer a parochial education over an education in the public school system seems to me quite irrelevant to the question whether the government's choice to pay for religious indoctrination is constitutionally permissible." and Justice Souter's, whose opinion questioned how the Court could keep ''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]'' on as precedent and decide this case in the way they did, feeling it was contradictory. He also found that religious instruction and secular education could not be separated and this itself violated the Establishment Clause.  . 

In 2006, the Florida Supreme Court struck down legislation known as the [[Florida Opportunity Scholarship Program]] (OSP), which would have implemented a system of school vouchers in Florida. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5159138|accessdate=2006-04-21|title=Court Throws Out Florida School Voucher Program}}</ref> The court ruled that the OSP violated article IX, section 1(a) of the Florida Constitution: "Adequate provision shall be made by law for a uniform, efficient, safe, secure, and high quality system of free public schools."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2006/sc04-2323.pdf|accessdate=2006-11-01|title=Florida Supreme Court Official Opinion: SC04-2323 – John Ellis "Jeb" Bush, Etc., Et Al. v. Ruth D. Holmes, Et Al.}}</ref> This decision was criticized by Clark Neily, [[Institute for Justice]] senior attorney and  legal counsel to Pensacola families using Florida Opportunity Scholarships, as "educational policymaking". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trolp.org/main_pgs/issues/v10n2/Neily.pdf |title=United States Court of Appeals, Twelfth Circuit |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-08-11}}</ref> . 

====Political support====. 
Political support for school vouchers in the United States is mixed. On the left/right spectrum, conservatives are more likely to support vouchers. Some state legislatures have enacted voucher laws.  In [[New Mexico]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Gary Johnson]] made school voucher provision the major issue of his second term as [[Governor of New Mexico|Governor]]. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heartland.org/schoolreform-news.org/Article/10881/Better_Education_Does_Make_All_the_Difference_Governor_Gary_E_Johnson.html |title=Better Education Does Make All the Difference: Governor Gary E. Johnson |first=George A. |last=Clowes |date=1 October 2000 |work=School Reform News |publisher=[[The Heartland Institute]] |accessdate=14 November 2010}}</ref>  As of 2006, the federal government operates the largest voucher program, for evacuees from the region affected by [[Hurricane Katrina]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  The Federal government also provides a voucher program for 7,500 residents of [[Washington, D.C.]] - the [[D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonscholarshipfund.org/index.html |title=Washington Scholarship Fund |publisher=Washington Scholarship Fund |date= |accessdate=2011-08-11}}</ref>  However, in early March 2009 congressional Democrats were moving to close down the program  and remove children from their voucher-funded school places at the end of the 09/10 school year under the $410 billion [[Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009]]<ref>Under Title IV of H.R.1015</ref> which, as of March 7 had passed the House and was pending in the Senate. The Obama administration stated<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2009-03-04-duncan-vouchers_N.htm |title=Secretary Duncan wants D.C. kids to keep vouchers |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2009-03-04 |accessdate=2011-08-11}}</ref> that it preferred to allow children already enrolled in the program to finish their schooling while closing the program to new entrants.  However, its preference on this matter does not appear to be strong enough to prevent the President from signing the Bill. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Briefing-by-White-House-Press-Secretary-Robert-Gibbs-3/2/09/ |title=Briefing by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, 3/2/09 &#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=2009-03-02 |accessdate=2011-08-11}}</ref> . 

Whether or not the public generally supports vouchers is debatable. Majorities seem to favor improving existing schools over providing vouchers, yet as many as 40% of those surveyed admit that they do not know enough to form an opinion or do not understand the system of school vouchers. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publicagenda.org/citizen/issueguides/education/publicview/redflags|title=Public Agenda Online, "Red Flags on Education: Lack of Knowledge About Vouchers."|accessdate=2008-07-25}}</ref> . 

In November 2000, a voucher system proposed by [[Tim Draper]] was placed on the [[California]] ballot as Proposition 38. It was unusual among school voucher proposals in that it required neither [[accreditation]] on the part of schools accepting vouchers, nor proof of need on the part of families applying for them; neither did it have any requirement that schools accept vouchers as payment-in-full, nor any other provision to guarantee a reduction in the real cost of private school tuition. The measure was defeated by a final percentage tally of 70.6 to 29.4.  . 

A state-wide universal school voucher system providing a maximum tuition subsidy of $3000 was passed in Utah in 2007, but 62% of voters repealed it in a statewide referendum before it took effect. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695225580,00.html|title=Vouchers Killed|accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> On April 27, 2011 [[Indiana]] passed a statewide voucher program, the largest in the U.S. It offers up to $4,500 to students with househould incomes under $41,000, and lesser benefits to households with higher incomes. The vouchers can be used to fund a variety of education options outside the public school system. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wishtv.com/dpp/news/politics/state_politics/keys-to-govs-education-reform-pass|title=Gov's Education Reform Passes|publisher=WISHTV News|date=April 27, 2011|accessdate=2011-04-28}}</ref> . 

In the United Kingdom, the [[Liberal Democrats]] advocated the voucher system in their book, the [[Orange Book]]. Former Labour Cabinet minister, [[Alan Milburn]], advocated a similar but fairer system which would give rights to low-income families to actually change school for a better schools so the better school gains funding from failing schools.  .
