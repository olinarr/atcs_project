Barack Obama's current economic advisors are [[Austan Goolsbee]] of the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Jeffrey Liebman]] of [[Harvard University]]. <ref>[[David Leonhardt]].

In 2006, Obama wrote: "We should be asking ourselves what mix of policies will lead to a dynamic [[free market]] and widespread economic security, entrepreneurial innovation and upward mobility [...] we should be guided by what works."<ref>Obama (2006), p. 159. </ref> . 

Speaking before the [[National Press Club (USA)|National Press Club]] in April 2005, he defended the [[New Deal]] social welfare policies of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], associating [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] proposals to establish private accounts for [[Social Security debate (United States)|Social Security]] with [[Social Darwinism]]. <ref>{{cite news|first=Ben A.|last=Franklin|coauthors=|title=The Fifth Black Senator in U.S. History Makes F.D.R.

==Corporate governance==. 
On April 20, 2007, Obama introduced a bill in the Senate (Shareholder Vote on Executive Compensation Act - S. 1181) requiring public companies to give shareholders an annual nonbinding vote on executive compensation, popularly called "[[Say on pay]]." A companion bill introduced by Rep. [[Barney Frank]] passed the House the same day. <ref>[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s110-1181 "S. 1181: A bill to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to provide shareholders with an advisory vote on executive compensation"] ''GovTrack.us''</ref> Several corporations voluntarily have begun to give shareholders such a vote because of concerns about excessive [[CEO]] salaries.  . 

==Labor rights==. 
Obama supports the [[Employee Free Choice Act]], a bill that adds penalties for labor violations and which would circumvent the [[card check|secret ballot]] requirement to organize a union.  Obama promises to sign the EFCA into law. <ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT OF 2007--MOTION TO PROCEED | date=2007-06-26 | publisher=GPO | url =http://frwebgate4.access.gpo.gov/| work =Congressional Record | pages =S8378-S8398 | accessdate = 2008-04-26 | language = }}</ref> He is also a cosponsor of the "Re-empowerment of Skilled and Professional Employees and Construction Tradesworkers" or RESPECT act (S. 969) that aims to overturn the [[National Labor Relations Board]]'s "Kentucky River" {{ussc|532|706|2001}} decision that redefined many employees lacking the authority to hire, fire, or discipline, as "supervisors" who are not protected by federal labor laws. <ref>[http://www.barackobama.com/issues/economy/#labor|Barack Obama issues]</ref><ref>[http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:S.969: S.979 - RESPECT Act]</ref> . 

==Minimum wage==. 
Obama favored the increase in the federal [[minimum wage]] from $5.15 an hour to $7.25, and he voted to end the [[filibuster]] against a bill to accomplish that. <ref>[http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=1&vote=00023 U.S. Senate Roll Call Vote on Motion to Invoke Cloture on H.R.2]</ref><ref>{{Citation| last = Bloomberg| author-link = Bloomberg L.P.  | title = Effort to Move on Minimum Wage Bill Falters in Senate| newspaper = [[The New York Times]]| date = January 25, 2007| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/25/us/politics/25wage.html?pagewanted=all}}</ref>

==Equal pay==. 
Obama favors the concept of equal pay (the abolition of [[wage]] differences between genders). <ref>{{Citation| last = Kugler| first = Sara | title = Obama tells women he supports equal pay| newspaper = [[USA Today]]| date = June 23, 2008| url = http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2008-06-23-2873054939_x.htm}}</ref>  He has supported legislation designed to improve the effectiveness of the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]]. <ref>[http://finduslaw.com/equal_pay_act_of_1963_epa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8_206_d Equal Pay Act of 1963]</ref> In 2007, the House of Representatives passed the [[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act]], which, according to the [[National Federation of Independent Business]], would have allowed "employees to file charges of pay discrimination within 180 days of the last received paycheck affected by the alleged discriminatory decision."<ref>{{cite web| last = Voter Information Services| title = DETAIL FOR 2007 House ROLL CALL VOTE 768| date = July 31, 2007| url = http://www.vis.org/toolbox/VoteDetail.aspx?vid=9219| accessdate = 2008-07-18}}</ref>  The bill would have overturned the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in [[Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.|''Ledbetter v. Goodyear'']].  There the Court dismissed a woman's discrimination claim because she had filed it more than 180 days after the ''first'' affected paycheck.  The bill died in a 2008 Senate vote in which Obama and other Democrats could not break a Republican [[filibuster]]. <ref>

==Education==. 
During an October 2004 debate, Obama stated that he opposed [[education voucher]]s for use at [[private school]]s because he believes they would undermine public schools. <ref>[http://www-news.uchicago.edu/citations/04/041027.obama-ct.html Keyes, Obama disagree sharply], [[The Chicago Tribune]], October 27, 2004.

[[File:Obama Portrait 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Barack Obama]] delivering a speech at the [[University of Southern California]] in support of [[California Proposition 87 (2006)|California Proposition 87]]]]
In his [[New Energy For America]] plan, Obama proposes to reduce overall U.S. [[oil consumption]] by at least 35%, or 10 million barrels per day, by 2030 in order to offset imports from [[OPEC]] nations. <ref>[http://www.barackobama.com/issues/energy/ Barack Obama | Change We Can Believe In | Energy]</ref><ref>[http://www.bostonherald.com/news/national/politics/2008/bios/view.bg?articleid=1063110 Barack Obama candidate platform], BostonHerald.com</ref> And by 2011 the United States was said to be "awash with domestic oil and increasingly divorced and less reliant on foreign imports". <ref>[http://mobile.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-12/ship-owners-to-lose-money-on-saudi-u-s-route-through-12-freight-market "Ship Owners to Lose Money on Saudi-U.S. Route Through ’12: Freight Markets."] ''Bloomberg News'', 12 September 2011. </ref> . 

Obama voted in favor of the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]], which provided incentives (chiefly tax breaks) to reduce national consumption of energy and to encourage a wide range of alternative energy sources. <ref>[http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=1&vote=00158 U.S. Senate Roll Call Vote on passage of H.R. 6]</ref><ref>[http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=1&vote=00213 U.S. Senate Roll Call Vote on passage of Conference Report]</ref> It also resulted in a net tax increase on oil companies. <ref>{{cite web| last = Murray| first = Mark| title = The McCain camp's new Palin TV ad | publisher = [[msnbc.com]]| date = September 3, 2008| url = http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/09/03/1333782.aspx| accessdate = 2008-09-03}}</ref> . 

Obama and other Senators introduced the [[BioFuels Security Act]] in 2006. "It's time for Congress to realize what farmers in America's heartland have known all along - that we have the capacity and ingenuity to decrease our dependence on foreign oil by growing our own fuel," Obama said. <ref>Baltimore, Chris.

In an interview with [[NBC]]'s [[Tim Russert]] on May 4, 2008, Obama said, "...we've got a serious food problem around the world. We've got [[2007–2008 world food price crisis|rising food prices]] here in the United States." "There's no doubt that [[biofuel]]s may be contributing to it. And what I've said is, my top priority is making sure that people are able to get enough to eat.

On the issue of [[nuclear power]], in 2005, Obama stated, "... as Congress considers policies to address air quality and the deleterious effects of carbon emissions on the global ecosystem, it is reasonable – and realistic – for nuclear power to remain on the table for consideration. Illinois has 11 nuclear power plants – the most of any State in the country – and nuclear power provides more than half of Illinois’ electricity needs."<ref>[http://epw.senate.gov/hearing_statements.cfm?id=238285 U.S. Senate Committee on Environment & Public Works], 05/26/2005, Statement of Senator Barack Obama</ref> Regarding McCain's plans for 45 new nuclear power plants, Obama said that it's not serious, it's not new, it's not the kind of energy policy that will give families the relief they need. <ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-kelly/john-mccain-should-probab_b_109069.html Chris Kelly: John McCain Should Probably Stop Calling Barack Obama "Dr. No"]</ref> Obama declared himself flatly opposed to building the [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]] in [[Nevada]]. <ref>[http://www.sacbee.com/111/story/464098.html Politics - Clinton, Obama oppose nuclear facility in Nevada - sacbee.com] {{Dead link|date=June 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>[http://www.breitbart.com/print.php?id=D8SSLP480&show_article=1 Democrats Oppose Nuclear Waste Dump]</ref> Furthermore, he opposes new nuclear plants until the problems of nuclear waste storage, safety and cost can be addressed. <ref>[http://www.loe.org/shows/segments.htm?programID=08-P13-00042&segmentID=2]</ref> .

On January 24, 2007 Obama spoke about his position on health care at [[Families USA]], a health care advocacy group.  Obama said, "The time has come for [[universal health care]] in America [...] I am absolutely determined that by the end of the first term of the next president, we should have universal health care in this country."  Obama went on to say that he believed that it was wrong that forty-seven million Americans are uninsured, noting that taxpayers already pay over $15 billion annually to care for the uninsured. <ref>Pickler, Nedra, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/25/AR2007012500764.html Obama calls for universal health care], ''Associated Press'', January 25, 2007 (accessed January 25, 2007)</ref> Obama cites cost as the reason so many Americans are without health insurance. <ref>[http://www.week.com/news/political/11790206.html Obama's Health Care Plan | WEEK News 25 | Political<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Obama's health care plan includes implementing guaranteed eligibility for affordable health care for all Americans, paid for by insurance reform, reducing costs, removing [[patent]] protection for pharmaceuticals, and required employer contributions. <ref>[http://www.barackobama.com/issues/healthcare/ BarackObama.com - Healthcare]</ref> He would provide for mandatory health care insurance for children.  . 

In July 2008 ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Senator Obama has promised to “bring down premiums by $2,500 for the typical family.”  His advisers have said that the $2,500 premium reduction includes, in addition to direct premium savings, the average family's share of the reduction in employer paid health insurance premiums and the reduction in the cost of government health programs such as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]]. <ref>Kevin Sack, [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/23/us/23health.html?hp=&pagewanted=print "Obstacles for Obama in Meeting Health Care Goal,"] [[The New York Times]], July 23, 2008</ref> . 

The [[Associated Press]] reported in September 2008 that Senator Obama was proposing a National Health Insurance Exchange that would include both private insurance plans and a Medicare-like government run option. Coverage would be guaranteed regardless of health status, and premiums would not vary based on health status either. The campaign estimates the cost of the program at $60 billion annually. The plan requires that parents cover their children, but does not require adults to buy insurance. <ref>[[Associated Press]], [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/09/11/ap/politics/main4438238.shtml "Coverage Guarantee Can Hit Young The Hardest: Obama Health Plan Follows Where Some States Have Struggled,"] September 11, 2008</ref> . 

According to an October 26, 2008 article in the New York Times, Obama is considering a new payroll tax on large and medium employers who do not already provide their employees with health insurance, and this tax would be used to pay for health care for uninsured people, but Obama has not cited the specific percentage of payroll that the tax would be, or how small a number of employees the employer would have to have in order to be exempt from the tax. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/27/us/politics/27healthcare.html?_r=3&pagewanted=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&oref=slogin&oref=slogin Businesses Wary of Details in Obama Health Plan], The New York Times, October 26, 2008</ref> .

Obama voted for the $700 billion [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]]. <ref>[http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=2&vote=00213 U.S. Senate vote on Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]</ref> . 

Obama introduced the Stop Fraud Act<ref>[http://www.barackobama.com/issues/economy/ Barack Obama and Joe Biden: The Change We Need | Economy]</ref> to increase penalties for mortgage fraud by [[mortgage brokers]] and [[real estate brokers]] and to provide more protections for low-income homebuyers.  .

Obama reversed his previous position and canceled the Constellation Program in his FY 11 budget.  “We are proposing canceling the program, not delaying it,” Peter Orszag, director of the Office of Management and Budget said in the NY Times.  Despite the efforts of both Senate and House Leaders to save the program, the program was effectively shutdown, laying off thousands of aerospace workers. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/02/science/02nasa.html | work=The New York Times | first=Kenneth | last=Chang | title=Obama Calls for End to NASA's Moon Program | date=February 2, 2010}}</ref> <ref> [http://www.motherboard.tv/2010/8/3/the-reason-we-have-a-space-agency-nasa-s-bittersweet-orion-promo-video--2]</ref> . 

==Network neutrality and government use of information technology==.

==Taxation==.

Under Obama's plan, middle-class families would see their income taxes cut, with no family making less than $250,000 seeing an increase. However, he did vote for a budget in June 2008, that would raise the taxes on single people with a taxable income of over $32,000 by pushing up their tax bracket from 25% to 28%. <ref>[http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=2&vote=00142 110th Congress, roll call vote No. 142, (June 4, 2008)]</ref> Obama has proposed a tax plan which includes [[Tax credit#Tax credits as a form of state benefit|tax credits]] to lower the amount of taxes paid. It is argued that the typical middle-class family would receive over $1,000 in tax relief, with tax payments that are 20% lower than they faced under President [[Ronald Reagan]]. According to the Tax Policy Center, the Obama plan provides three times as much tax relief for middle-class families as the McCain plan. <ref name="origin.barackobama.com">http://origin.barackobama.com/taxes</ref> Obama's plan includes a temporary "[[Making Work Pay tax credit|Making Work Pay]]" program, which gives a tax credit at 6.2% of earned income ''up to'' $400 for single workers (making less than $75,000/yr), and an $800 for married couples (making less than $150,000/yr), expiring at the end of 2010; this is claimed on Schedule M of [[Form 1040]]. <ref>[http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=204447,00.html The Making Work Pay Tax Credit]. Internal Revenue Service website</ref> Families making more than $250,000 would pay either the same or lower income tax rates than they paid in the 1990s, leaving no family to pay higher income tax rates than they would have paid in the 1990s. For the wealthiest 2% of families, Obama plans to reverse a portion of [[Bush tax cuts|the tax cuts they have received over the past eight years]].  Dividend rates would be 39 percent lower than what President [[George W. Bush]] proposed in [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001|his 2001 tax cut]]. <ref name="origin.barackobama.com"/>  . 

Obama’s plan is to cut income taxes overall, which he states would reduce revenues to below the levels that prevailed under Ronald Reagan (less than 18.2 percent of GDP). Obama argues that his plan is a net tax cut, and that his tax relief for middle class families is larger than the revenue raised by his tax changes for families over $250,000. Obama plans to pay for the tax changes while bringing down the budget deficit by cutting unnecessary spending. <ref name="origin.barackobama.com"/> . 

Speaking in November 2006 to members of [[Wake Up Wal-Mart]], a union-backed [[Political campaign|campaign group]], Obama said: "You need to pay your workers enough that they can actually not only shop at [[Wal-Mart]], but ultimately send their kids to college and save for retirement." His tax plan is projected to bring in an additional $700 billion in taxes over the next 10 years. <ref>{{cite news|first=Pallavi|last=Gogoi|coauthors=|title=Can Barack Wake Up Wal-Mart?|date=November 16, 2006|publisher=|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/nov2006/db20061116_897533.htm|work=BusinessWeek.Com|pages=|accessdate=2007-01-21|language=}} See also: {{cite news|first=|last=|coauthors=|title=Sen.

During an October 13, 2008 speech at [[Toledo, Ohio]], Obama said that for the next two years, he favors a $3,000 tax credit to businesses for each new full time employee whom they hire above the number in their current work force. <ref name="Obama Expands Economic Plans">[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/14/us/politics/14campaign.html?_r=1&oref=slogin Obama Expands Economic Plans], The New York Times, October 13, 2008</ref> .

In response to a possible shortfall in [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] funding, Obama has endorsed imposition of a new [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|FICA]] tax on incomes above $250,000.  Currently, income above $106,800 is exempt from such taxation.

On January 24, 2007, in reference to his stated plan to take public financing should he procure the nomination, he said, "I think that for a time, the presidential public financing system works." On November 27, he said, "I will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election," and on February 28, 2008, he wrote that he planned to "aggressively pursue" a publicly financed campaign, later promising to sit down with John McCain to ensure "a public system" of campaign financing is preserved. <ref>[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0608/11212.html Politico’s guide to Obama’s opt-out - Ariel Alexovich and Jacqueline Klingebiel - Politico.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, on June 19, 2008, he opted out of public campaign financing and declared, "I support a robust system of public financing of elections (...) but the public financing of presidential elections as it exists today is broken."<ref>{{cite news

In reference to state ballot initiatives on affirmative action, Obama's spokesperson [[Candice Toliver]] said that "Senator Obama believes in a country in which opportunity is available to all Americans, regardless of race, gender or economic status.

Barack Obama made critical statements about the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) during the Democratic primaries, calling the trade agreement "devastating" and "a big mistake". <ref name="CNNMoney">[http://money.cnn.com/2008/06/20/magazines/fortune/easton_obama.fortune/?postversion=2008062308 CNN Money]</ref> In February 2008, a Canadian diplomatic memo<ref>{{cite web

==Faith based programs==. 
In July 2008, after winning the primary, Obama announced that he wants to expand federal funding of [[faith-based]] programs and establish a "Council for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships". He specified that, under his plan, federal money given to places of worship could only be used on secular programs. In particular, he mentioned, on July 1 in [[Zanesville, Ohio]], that "support for social services to the poor and the needy have consistently been underfunded". He went on to praise President Bush's efforts, but contended that the current administration's plan never managed to "rally the armies of compassion."<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/07/01/america/02campaigncnd.php  Obama plan would expand faith-based program], International Herald Tribune, July 1, 2008</ref><ref>{{cite news

On September 22, 2008, Obama said, "I am not a Democrat who believes that we can or should defend every government program just because it's there... We will fire government managers who aren't getting results, we will cut funding for programs that are wasting your money and we will use technology and lessons from the private sector to improve efficiency across every level of government...
