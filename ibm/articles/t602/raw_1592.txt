'''Michelle A. Rhee''' ([[Korean language|Korean]]: 이양희;<ref name="chosun_ilbo"/> ''I Yang-hui''; born December 25, 1969) is a public figure involved in the American education system. She was [[Chancellor#Educational usage|chancellor]] of the [[Washington, D.C.]] [[District of Columbia Public Schools|public schools]] from 2007 to 2010. In late 2010, she founded [[StudentsFirst]], a [[non-profit]], [[tax-exempt]] political advocacy organization which works on education reform issues such as ending teacher [[tenure]].  . 

She began her career by teaching for three years in an [[inner city]] school, then founded and ran [[The New Teacher Project]], which in ten years recruited and trained more than 23,000 new teachers to work in urban schools. <ref name="DCExaminer2007"/> . 

==Early life and education==. 
Rhee was born in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], the second of three children of [[South Korea]]n immigrants Shang Rhee, a physician, and Inza Rhee, a clothing store owner. <ref name="Washingtonian 2007"/><ref name="tackles"/> She was raised in the [[Toledo, Ohio]] area and educated in the public schools, through the sixth grade. <ref name="tackles"/> Her parents then sent her to South Korea to attend school for one year. <ref name="tackles"/> Upon her return, they enrolled her in a private school because they felt the public school was lacking. <ref name="tackles"/> . 

Growing up, Rhee's father encouraged her to do community service. <ref name="Washingtonian 2007"/> During her teenage years, she worked with children and spent a summer working on a Native American reservation. <ref name="Washingtonian 2007"/> . 

She graduated from the private [[Maumee Valley Country Day School]] in 1988, and went on to [[Cornell University]] where she received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[government]] in 1992. She later earned a [[Master of Public Policy|master's degree in public policy]] from [[Harvard University]]'s [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]].  . 

==Teaching==. 
Inspired by a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] special that she saw when she was a senior in college, Rhee signed up with [[Teach For America]], went through their brief training period in how to teach, then worked for three years as a teacher in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. <ref name="Washingtonian 2007"/><ref name="NYTimes"/> She was assigned to one of the lowest-performing schools. <ref name="tackles"/> She had difficulty controlling her classroom the first year. <ref name="tackles"/> She has said the stress gave her hives,<ref name="tackles"/> and that she once put small pieces of masking tape on the children's mouths so they would be quiet on the way to the lunchroom. <ref name="first year"/><ref name="rhee talks"/> Rhee told Washingtonian magazine that she was demoralized by her first year of teaching, but said to herself, "I’m not going to let eight-year-old kids run me out of town", and took more courses in education and received her [[Certified teacher|teachers' certification]]. <ref name="Washingtonian 2007"/>  Rhee first year test scores showed a precipitous drop in her class: Average math percentile dropped from 64% to 17%.  Average reading percentile dropped from 37% to 21%. <ref name="HarlemPark">{{cite news|url=http://gfbrandenburg.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/cohort-effects-at-harlem-park-jpg.jpg|title=Proficiency Scores at Harlem Park Elementary|accessdate=May 31, 2011}}</ref> . 

She told ''The New York Times'' that the students she taught her second and third years had national standardized test scores that were initially at the 13th percentile—but at the end of two years, the class was at grade level, with some students performing at the 90th percentile. <ref name="NYTimes"/> Earlier she had said on her resume that 90 percent of her students had attained scores at the 90th percentile. <ref name="early test"/> In 2010, a retired math teacher unearthed test score data on Rhee's Baltimore school which indicated that her students' scores went up during the 2nd and 3rd years, but that the percentile gains were less than half what Rhee claimed:<ref name="early test"/>  In Math her scores went from 22 percentile to 52 percentile, an average increase of 15 percentile annually. <ref name="HarlemPark"/> In reading, her scores went from 14 percentile to 48 percentile, an average increase of 17 percentile annually. <ref name="HarlemPark"/>  Rhee claimed that the discrepancies between the official test scores and the ones she claimed on her resume were because her principal at the time had informed her of the gains but those results may not have been the official state tests that were preserved. <ref name="early test"/> . 

==New Teacher Project==. 
In 1997, Rhee founded and began serving as the CEO of The New Teacher Project, a non-profit which within ten years of its founding, had trained and supplied urban school districts with 23,000 mid-career professionals wanting to become classroom teachers. <ref name="NYTimes"/> The Project has mainly served New York, Chicago, Miami and Philadelphia,<ref name="NYTimes"/> Beginning in 2000, the Project began redesigning the D.C. school's recruitment and hiring processes. <ref name="DCExaminer2007"/> . 

==Chancellor of D.C. public schools==. 
In 2007 the D.C. board of education was stripped of its decision-making powers and turned into an advisory body, and the new office of chancellor was created—so that changes in the public school system could be made without waiting for the approval of an often argumentative board. <ref name="Washingtonian 2007"/><ref name="tackles"/> Newly-elected D.C. Mayor [[Adrian Fenty]] quickly offered Rhee the job of chancellor;<ref name="Washingtonian 2007"/> she accepted after being promised  mayoral backing for whatever changes she wanted to make. <ref name="fenty to oust"/> Critics noted that Rhee had no experience running a school system,<ref name="Washingtonian 2007"/> and had not even been a principal. She had been highly recommended to Fenty, however, by the chancellor of the New York public schools. <ref name="was fired"/> . 

Rhee inherited a troubled system; there had been six school chiefs in the previous 10 years,<ref name="Washingtonian 2007"/> students historically had below-average scores on standardized tests,{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} and according to Rhee, only 8% of eighth graders were at grade level in mathematics. <ref name="devastating"/> The D.C. schools were performing poorly despite having the advantage of the third highest spending per student in the US. <ref name="spends"/> . 

Upon taking office, Rhee immediately began to make a series of radical changes that relied on top-down accountability and results from standardized tests. <ref name="100 mph"/> She said there was no time to waste because children were being robbed of their futures. <ref name="100 mph"/> In her first year on the job, Rhee unapologetically closed 23 schools, fired 36 principals and cut approximately 121 office jobs. <ref name="100 mph"/> Stated reasons for the closings were under-enrollment and excess square footage. <ref name="notice"/><ref name="revised"/> Following Rhee's announcement of some of the changes, D.C. Council members asked for more information about how the decisions had been made. <ref name="notice"/> . 

In February 2008, Rhee also announced a plan to add early-childhood programs, gifted and talented programs, art and music classes, and special education services to District schools. <ref name="notice"/> . 

In 2008, she also tried to renegotiate teacher compensation, offering teachers the choice of salaries of up to $140,000 based on what she termed "student achievement" with no tenure rights or earning much smaller pay raises with tenure rights retained. Teachers and the teachers union rejected the proposal, contesting that some form of tenure was necessary to protect against arbitrary, political, or wrongful termination of employment. <ref name="takes on tenure"/> . 

In 2010, Rhee and the unions agreed on a new contract that offered 20% pay raises and bonuses of $20,000 to $30,000 for "strong student achievement," in exchange for weakened teachers' seniority protections and the end of teacher tenure for one year. Under this new agreement, Rhee fired 241 teachers, the vast majority of whom received poor evaluations, and put 737 additional school employees on notice. <ref name="dismisses 241"/> Of the dismissed teachers, 76 were dismissed in accordance with the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] because they lacked proper teaching certification. <ref name="dismisses"/> 26 other teachers were dismissed because their students had continually received low scores on the District of Columbia Comprehensive Assessment System. <ref name="dismisses"/> Teachers were observed by administrators and outside professionals for five 30-minute sessions during the year, and the teachers' performance was rated during those sessions. <ref name="dismisses"/> Teachers who received fewer than 175 out of 400 points were deemed ineffective and were dismissed. <ref name="dismisses"/> Teachers who received between 175 and 249 points were deemed minimally effective and given a one-year warning to improve their performance. <ref name="dismisses"/>  . 

===Support and criticism===. 
Michelle Rhee remains a highly controversial figure in the field of education due to her aggressive style of reform and what some believe to be anti-union sentiments. Another common criticism disputes her claim that she dramatically increased students' average scores from the 13th percentile to the 90th, a claim that could not be verified during her confirmation process for D.C. Schools Chancellor as the relevant Baltimore records could not be located. <ref name="challenge resume"/>
Rhee's actions have earned her applause from school reformers, as well as the scorn of teacher unions and community activists. Her supporters claim that under Rhee's chancellorship, student achievement in the D.C. Public Schools greatly improved. Since 2007, secondary schools have improved their standardized test pass rates by 14% in reading and 17% in math, while elementary school pass rates have improved 6% in reading and 15% in math. System-wide high school graduation rates also improved by 3%, up to 72% in 2009. <ref name="tied"/> By 2010, D.C. Comprehensive Assessment System reading pass rates had increased by 14 percentage points, and math pass rates had increased by 17 percentage points. Enrollment decreased by one percent, a slower decline than prior years. <ref name="tied"/> However, significant achievement gaps remained between students in high-performing and low-performing school districts, and between white and African American students. Education expert [[Diane Ravitch]] questioned the legitimacy of Rhee's results, alleging that "cheating, teaching to bad tests, institutionalized fraud, dumbing down of tests, and a narrowed curriculum" were the true outcomes of Rhee's tenure in D.C. schools. <ref name="Ravitch"/> . 

Some parents and community leaders said that Rhee's speed left them without input on the changes. <ref name="slide"/> The District Council also criticized Rhee for being unresponsive to Council members' requests for information about school operations. <ref name="slide"/> From 2008 to 2010, Rhee's approval ratings decreased from 59% to 43%. 28% of African Americans supported Rhee in 2010, down from 50% in 2008. <ref name="slide"/> . 

Rhee fired several administrators and school principals, including Marta Guzman, the principal of the high-performing Oyster-Adams Bilingual Elementary School, which Rhee's own children attended. <ref name="tackles"/><ref name="Turque2008"/> Some parents alleged that the firing process was neither transparent nor fair. According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'', "the departure has stunned many Oyster-Adams parents who wondered why, in a city filled with under-performing public schools, Rhee would sack a principal who has presided for the past five years over one of its few success stories. The move also heightened ethnic and class tensions within the school's diverse community. Eduardo Barada, co-chairman of the Oyster-Adams Community Council, the school's PTA, said Guzman was toppled by a cadre of dissatisfied and largely affluent Anglo parents with the ear of a woman who was both a fellow parent and the chancellor."<ref name="Turque2008"/>. She replaced Marta Guzman with her friend Monica Liang Aguirre.  Ms. Aguirre was later found to discriminate against minority students at Oyster in a 2010 federal investigation.  Despite these findings Rhee kept Ms. Aguirre on board. However, Rhee did fire a principal she had hired seven weeks before in Shepherd Elementary—another high-performing school in the upper [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|Northwest neighborhood]]. <ref name="fires shepherd"/> . 

Detractors also complained about Rhee's closing of several D.C. schools without holding public hearings,<ref name="News8_2008"/> not reporting complete budget figures at recent D.C. council hearings,<ref name="News8_2008"/> excluding parents from involvement (GAO report),<ref name="urges more"/> hiring former supporters to conduct an evaluation of her performance in a show of conflict of interest,<ref name="watchdog"/> opposing student protests of her security policies,<ref name="walk out"/> managing using authoritarian principles, and spending considerable time before the national media (Time, PBS, lecture circuit) instead of visiting schools. <ref name="News8_2008"/> . 

[[File:Michelle Rhee at NOAA.jpg|right|thumb|230px|Rhee at a [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] awards ceremony, June 2008]] . 

Rhee and supporters responded that personnel decisions are based on the judgment of the chancellor and that closures and restructuring are necessary to effect reforms. <ref name="defends firing"/><ref name="union slams"/> . 

Referring to the 266 teachers she laid off, Rhee told a national business magazine: "I got rid of teachers who had hit children, who had had sex with children, who had missed 78 days of school. Why wouldn't we take those things into consideration?" At the time, she did not provide evidence of her accusations nor comment when asked why these accused teachers were allowed to be in the district prior to the dismissals. Union leadership asked Rhee to apologize to the 266 teachers for making remarks that were without basis in facts. <ref name="abused kids"/> Rhee refused to apologize, but clarified that only one teacher was dismissed due to sexual abuse allegations. <ref name="Hedge"/> . 

{{wikinews|District of Columbia Public Schools chancellor Michelle Rhee announces resignation}}
The [[Washington, D.C. mayoral election, 2010|Washington D.C. 2010 Mayoral Election]] was interpreted by political experts as a referendum on Rhee's unpopular tenure as school chancellor. <ref name="Fenty's Loss"/> Following the defeat of incumbent mayor Adrian Fenty in the 2010 Democratic primary election, Rhee called the election results "devastating for the schoolchildren of Washington, D.C."<ref name="devastating"/> Rhee encouraged education reformers to learn from the election and "be more aggressive and more adamant."<ref name="devastating"/> Fenty announced on October 13, 2010 that Rhee had resigned. Rhee launched a personal website, a [[Twitter]] account, and a [[Facebook]] page soon thereafter. <ref name="resign"/> . 

===Test erasures===. 
Investigations have questioned some of Rhee's accomplishments in increasing test scores in D.C. schools. <ref name="blames enemies"/> In 2008 the Office of the State Superintendent of Education discovered that 103 schools, over half of DC schools, were flagged by third parties for suspiciously high wrong-to-right answer changes. These including 8 of the 10 campuses where Rhee handed out TEAM awards "to recognize, reward and retain high-performing educators and support staff."   . 

At Phoebe Hearst Elementary, Winston Education Campus, and Aiton Elementary, 85% or more of classrooms were identified as having high erasure rates in 2008. At four other schools, the percentage of classrooms in that category ranged from 17% to 58%.  In return for increased test scores in D.C. schools, Rhee gave performance awards and increased compensation to the teachers and administrators totaling over $1.5 million.  . 

During Rhee's tenure, CTB/McGraw-Hill informed her office of abnormally high rates of answer changes at [[Noyes Elementary]].  Answers were consistently changed from wrong to right.  The gains in test scores made at Noyes Elementary School earned the school recognition as a Blue Ribbon School.  Rhee promoted the school as a model for her education reform movement. <ref name = "Testing Scandal"/> . 

Statisticians, including Professor Emeritus Thomas Haladyna, stated to [[USA Today]] that "the odds are better for winning the [[Powerball]] grand prize than having that many erasures by chance."  Haladyna suggested that the answer sheets had been tampered with and that an investigation was needed.  . 

No investigations occurred in D.C. in 2008. In 2009 a limited investigation was conducted on behalf of OSSE that examined whether protocols were adhered to at eight schools, but never examined whether administrators or teachers may have tampered with the test results. Mary Lord, a state board member, was critical of the decision not to investigate the 2008 scores. "If you are going to add all this weight" to testing, "hanging the principals' reputations ... and the teachers' pay on it, you have to make sure it is totally accurate," Lord says.  . 

Chancellor Kaya Henderson, who was Rhee's deputy chancellor and replaced Rhee after her resignation in October 2010, stated that "a high erasure rate alone is not evidence of impropriety", and maintained that D.C. "has investigated all allegations of testing impropriety" and "enforced clear consequences" for staff found to be involved.   . 

Rhee defended herself on the [[Tavis Smiley]] Show, but has since retracted her comments. She claimed an unnamed "third party" investigated any suspicious scores. Rhee did not explain the high rate of erasures on tests, but called the ''USA Today'' article an attack on school reform. She said, "It isn’t surprising that the enemies of school reform once again are trying to argue that the Earth is flat and that there is no way test scores could have improved .... unless someone cheated."<ref name="fresh scrutiny"/> Since then she told ''Washington Post'' reporter Jay Mathews that her previous remarks were "stupid" and she is glad her successor, Acting Chancellor Kaya Henderson, ordered a new investigation. <ref name="on test erasures"/> . 

==School choice and school vouchers==. 
In 2008, Rhee's office released a statement that said, "While Chancellor Rhee hasn’t taken a formal position on vouchers, she disagrees with the notion that vouchers are the remedy for repairing the city’s school system."<ref name="position on vouchers"/> In an op-ed published in the ''Wall Street Journal'' on January 11, 2011, Rhee endorsed vouchers when she supported, "giving poor families access to publicly funded scholarships to attend private schools," adding that "All children deserve the chance to get a great education; no family should be forced to send kids to a school they know is failing."<ref name="an opening"/> In a February 2011 speech before Georgia's legislature, she indicated she had supported the DC voucher program as a supplement to the charter school alternative. She said that if a parent did not win the lotto to get their child into a charter school, then "who I am to deny them a $7,500 voucher to send their child to a great Catholic school."<ref name="on vouchers">{{cite news|title=Michelle Rhee on vouchers, social promotion and putting kids first|date=February 10, 2011|author=Maureen Downey|url=http://blogs.ajc.com/get-schooled-blog/2011/02/10/michelle-rhee-on-vouchers-social-promotion-and-putting-kids-first/|work=Atlanta Journal Constitution|accessdate=July 17, 2011}}</ref> . 

==After D.C. schools==. 
On December 6, 2010, Ms. Rhee went on the Oprah Winfrey show to announce that she had declined all job offers resulting from her high profile work as D.C. Chancellor and would be focusing on a new advocacy organization she had formed called StudentsFirst. <ref name="big announcement"/> She told Winfrey's audience she wanted to have one million members and raise one billion dollars in order to catalyze education reform in the United States. <ref name="big announcement"/> According to ''The New York Times'' abolishing teacher [[tenure]] is a main objective of Rhee and the group. <ref name="take aim"/> Within weeks of its founding, Rhee and Students First had advised the governors of Florida, Nevada and New Jersey on abolishing teacher tenure and other issues related to public education reform. <ref name="take aim"/>  In 2010-2011, Rhee served on the transition team of Florida Republican Governor [[Rick Scott]]. <ref name="not heading"/> . 

She has also been a visible figure in the national media, appearing on television shows, radio programs, and the documentary film [[Waiting for Superman]]. In May 2011, Rhee spoke in favor of school choice alongside the Wisconsin Republican Governor [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]] at an event hosted by the American Federation for Children, a pro-school choice education organization founded and funded by [[Betsy DeVos]]. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post_now/post/michelle-rhee-to-speak-in-dc/2011/05/09/AFPQkzWG_blog.html|title=Rhee to speak in D.C.|agency=Associated Press|work=The Washington Post|date=May 9, 2011|accessdate=July 18, 2011}}</ref> . 

In October 2011, Rhee's group StudentsFirst launched an initiative to defend Michigan Republican Paul Scott against a recall effort. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2011/10/michelle_rhee_group_studentsfi.html|title=Michelle Rhee group StudentsFirst spends thousands to support Rep. Paul Scott in recall fight|agency=Flint Journal|work=mlive.com|date=October 25, 2011|accessdate=October 26, 2011}}</ref> Rhee's organization has dedicated nearly $70,000 to defend state representative Scott.  Scott's opponent in the upcoming race, Bobbie Walton, said StudentsFirst's involvement in the local election was "evidence of a national push to discredit teachers unions." . 

==Awards and recognition==. 
{{Expand section|date=May 2011}}
Rhee has served on the advisory boards for the [[National Council on Teacher Quality]],<ref name="nctq"/> and the National Center for Alternative Certification. <ref name="alt cert"/> She was a special guest of [[First Lady]] [[Laura Bush]] at [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s 2008 [[State of the Union]] address. <ref name="among first"/> . 

==Personal life==. 
While Rhee was teaching, she met [[Kevin Huffman]], who was also a member of Teach for America and later became head of public affairs of the organization. <ref name="tackles"/> The couple married two years after they met and had two daughters before being divorced in 2007. <ref name="tackles"/><ref name="unlikely"/> The children attended the Oyster-Adams public elementary school, considered one of the best in Washington D.C. while Rhee was chancellor. <ref name="tackles"/><ref name="recruited"/> . 

In March 2010, Rhee became engaged to [[Kevin Johnson]], mayor of [[Sacramento, California]] and former [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] player. <ref>{{cite news|author=Jim Iovino|url=http://www.nbcwashington.com/around-town/events/Lessons-in-Engagement-69336137.html |title=Lessons in Engagement: Rhee, Johnson reportedly engaged |publisher=NBC Washington |date=November 5, 2009|accessdate=May 25, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/09/AR2010030903532.html|title=Kevin Johnson's winning streak: NBA, Sacramento City Hall, Michelle Rhee's heart|author=Wil Haygood|work=The Washington Post|date=March 10, 2010|accessdate=May 25, 2011}}</ref> The two married in September 2011 in a small ceremony at Blackberry Farm near Knoxville. <ref>Reliable Source blog: [http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/post/michelle-rhee-and-kevin-johnson-kept-their-wedding-under-the-radar/2011/09/07/gIQAZIXIAK_blog.html Michelle Rhee and Kevin Johnson kept their wedding under the radar], ''Washington Post'' (September 7, 2011).
