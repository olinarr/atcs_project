A '''service voucher''' is a financial instrument which allows a public authority to target social services at those it deems in need, and at the same time to promote employment and labour market integration. It effectively boosts demand for certain services which meet social policy objectives.  . 

A voucher scheme will typically start by defining services which are needed in society, but which are being supplied neither by the [[market]] nor by the [[public sector]]. These might include for example [[home care]], household repairs, [[ironing]], or [[bicycle]] hire and repair. The activities within the scheme will typically be agreed with [[trade union]]s and [[employer]]s' organisations, to avoid concern about the disturbance of [[unfair competition]].  . 

Potential providers of these services are identified, often from among the [[unemployment#Long-term unemployment|long-term unemployed]].  . 

Vouchers are sold to people who want to use the service. The price is subsidised, so that on the one hand the service is affordable - and for instance can compete with informal (illegal) work - and on the other provides decent condition working for the employees (including [[social insurance]] cover, holiday pay etc.). An example subsidy regime is the one in [[Belgium]], where an hour's work is bought at EUR 7 and sold at EUR 20.  .
