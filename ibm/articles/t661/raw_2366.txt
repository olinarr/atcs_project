Normal '''aging movement control''' in human is about the changes on the [[muscle]]s, [[motor neuron]]s, [[Nervous system|nerves]], [[Sensory neuron|sensory functions]], [[gait]], fatigue, visual and manual responses, in men and women as they get older but who do not have [[Neurological disorder|neurological]], muscular ([[muscular atrophy|atrophy]], [[muscular dystrophy|dystrophy]]...) or [[neuromuscular disease|neuromuscular]] disorder. With aging, neuromuscular movements are impaired though with training or practice, some aspects may be prevented.  . 

==Force production== . 

For voluntary force production, [[action potential]]s occur in the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]]. They propagate in the [[spinal cord]], the [[motor neuron]]s and the set of [[Skeletal striated muscle|muscle fibers]] they innervate. This results in a [[Muscle contraction|twitch]] which properties are driven by 2 mechanisms: [[motor unit recruitment]] and [[rate coding]]. Both mechanisms are affected with aging. For instance, the number of [[motor unit]]s may decrease, the size of the motor units, i.e. the number of muscle fibers they innervate may increase, the frequency at which the action potentials are triggered may be reduced. Consequently, force production is generally impaired in old adults. <ref name="12x">Neuromechanics of human movement, chapter 6 Single-joint system function; Roger M. Enoka. </ref> . 

Aging is associated with decreases in muscle mass and [[physical strength|strength]]. These decreases may be partially due to losses of [[alpha motor neurons]]. By the age of 70, these losses occur in both [[Anatomical_terms_of_location#Proximal_and_distal|proximal and distal muscles]]. In [[Biceps brachii muscle|biceps brachii]] and [[Brachialis muscle|brachialis]], old adults show decreased strength (by 1/3) correlated with a reduction in the number of motor units (by 1/2). Old adults show evidence that remaining motor units may become larger as motor units innervate collateral muscle fibers. <ref name="4x">Effects of motor unit losses on strength in older men and women; Doherty T.J., Vandervoort A.A., Taylor A.W., and Brown W.F., 1993. </ref> . 

In [[Dorsal interossei of the hand|first dorsal interosseus]], almost all motor units are recruited at moderate rate coding, leading to 30-40% of [[muscle contraction|maximal voluntary contraction]] (MVC). Motor unit [[Rate coding|discharge rates]] measured at 50% MVC are not significantly different in the young subjects from those observed in the old adults. However, for the maximal effort contractions, there is an appreciable difference in discharge rates between the two age groups. Discharge rates obtained at 100% of MVC are 64% smaller in the old adults than in the young subjects: 31.1 ± 11.8 impulses/s in the old subjects, 50.9 ± 19.5 impulses/s in the young subjects. <ref name="5x">Motor unit discharge behavior in older adults during maximal-effort contractions; Gary Kamen, Steven V. Sison, C. C. Duke Du, and Carolynn Patten, 1995. </ref> . 

[[Muscle_contraction#Isometric_contraction|Isometric strength]] and [[Pennate_muscle#Physiological_cross_sectional_area_.28PCSA.29|physical cross-sectional area]] of the [[elbow]] [[flexion|flexors]] and elbow [[Extension (kinesiology)|extensors]] are reduced in old compared with young men. The normalized force (maximal voluntary force to the size of the muscle producing the force) of the elbow extensors is the same for old and young people. The normalized force for the elbow flexors is reduced in the old men compared to the young men. The lower normalized force of the elbow flexors may be due to an increase in [[Agonist muscle|agonist]]-[[Antagonist muscle|antagonist]] muscles [[Coactivation (Muscular)|coactivation]]. <ref name="7x">Normalized force, activation, and coactivation in the arm muscles of young and old men; C.S. Klein, C.L. Rice and G.D. Marsh, 2001. </ref> . 

Compared to the young group, the old group has lower [[Dorsiflexion|dorsiflexors]] isometric [[torque]] at all angles, has lower [[knee]] extensors isometric torque at angles >90°. The impairment in force production is muscle specific. During [[Isometric_exercise#Comparison_with_dynamic_exercises|dynamic]] exercise, the old group requires more time to reach a target velocity and is less able to attain high velocities. The slowing of voluntary contractile speed with age seems to play a role in the loss of dynamic torque. <ref name="8x">Effects of age on human muscle torque, velocity and power in two muscle groups; Lanza, Towse, Caldwell, Wigmore, Kent-Braun, 2003. </ref> . 

==Sensory function== . 

The detection of a [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] by a [[Sensory receptor|receptor]] in the [[Afferent nerve fiber|afferent nerve terminals]] (vs [[efferent nerve fiber|efferent nerve terminals]]) is useful to protect the body against unexpected disturbances. Studies in post-mortem subjects support that the thickness of [[muscle spindle]] capsules increases with age. There is a slight decrease in the number of [[Intrafusal muscle fiber|intrafusal fibers]] in the oldest subjects. Some spindles show changes consistent with denervation associated with grouped denervation [[atrophy]]. Age-related changes are observed in fine structure of [[spindle nerve]] [[nerve|innervation]] in the form of [[axon]]al swelling and expanded/abnormal [[joint|endplates]]. <ref name="1x">The Effect of Age on Human Skeletal Muscle Studies of the Morphology and Innervation of Muscle Spindles; Swash, M and Fox, KP, 1972. </ref> . 

When subject to a task of [[proprioception]], the elderly show increased [[coactivation|cocontraction]] of agonist-antagonist muscles, perhaps to increase [[Gamma motoneuron|gamma drive]] and spindle sensitivity. It is believed to be used for postural control. Despite a cocontraction strategy, old adults have higher reaction time and also make greater errors in estimating the position of their [[ankle]]. The elderly subjects with greater errors for the dynamic position sense also perform poorly on the single limb stance eyes closed test. <ref name="9x">The effect of age on dynamic position sense: evidence using a sequential movement task; Madhavan S, Shields RK, 2005. </ref> . 

Old adults sway more than young adults while maintaining upright standing posture, especially with eyes closed with a narrow base of support. Young adults show “resourcefulness” by shifting from one sensory input ([[Visual system|vision]]) to another ([[Somatosensory system|somatosensory]]) whereas old adults do not rely on the variety of sensory inputs but rather respond by stiffening their ankles across tasks (wide base of support vs narrow base of support, eyes open vs eyes closed). <ref name="10x">Aging-induced shifts from a reliance on sensory input to muscle cocontraction during balanced standing; Benjuya N, Melzer I, & Kaplanski J, 2004. </ref> . 

Sensory receptors can initiate rapid responses to perturbations thanks to short-latency connections between afferent innervations and motor units. Yet, aging results in decreases in motor conduction velocities. This may be due to losses of the fastest conducting motor units. There is also evidence of slowing of both fast and slow conducting axons which can be explained by decreases in axon diameter through [[myelin|demyelination]], by reduction of [[internodal segment|internodal length]]. Some studies suggest an overall decrease in the number of myelinated fibers. <ref name="2x">Age-related changes in fastest and slowest conducting axons of thenar motor units; Wang F-C, de la Citadelle H, and Delwaide PJ, 1999. </ref> . 

Aging results in slowed reaction time in an aiming task for both [[eye]] and [[hand]] movements. Comparisons between young and old adults who have to follow a target only with their eyes or with a [[laser]] in their hand, show that parameters indicative of motor function such as velocity, duration, and amplitude of initial movement are unchanged. However the duration of corrective movement is longer for old adults. It suggests an impairment to sensory system. <ref name="3x">Effects of Aging on Sensorimotor Functions of eye and hand movements; Warabi T, Noda H, and Kato T, 1986. </ref> . 

==Walking gait== . 

When confronted to an unexpected slip or trip during walking, compared to young adults, old adults have a less effective [[Balance (ability)|balance]] strategy: smaller and slower postural muscle responses, altered temporal and spatial organization of the postural response, agonist-antagonist muscles coactivation and greater upper trunk instability. Comparing control and slip conditions, after the perturbation, young adults have a longer stride length, a longer stride duration, and the same walk velocity whereas old adults have a shorter stride length, the same stride duration, and a lower walk velocity. <ref name="21x">Inefficient postural responses to unexpected slips during walking in older adults; Pei-Fang Tang and Marjorie H. Woollacott, 1998. </ref> . 

In an experiment, for a single-task walking, 24% of old adults have [[gait]] speed <0.8&nbsp;m/s but for a [[Dual-task paradigm|dual-task]] of walking and talking, 62% of old adults have gait speed <0.8&nbsp;m/s. In practical terms, this means that a large proportion of healthy community-dwelling old adults may not walk fast enough to safely cross the street while simultaneously having a conversation. These findings support the assertion that generating spontaneous speech is highly demanding on [[cognition|cognitive]] resources and suggest that real world dual-task effects on gait may be underestimated by reaction time tasks. <ref name="19x">Dual-task effects of spontaneous speech and executive function on gait in aging: Exaggerated effects in slow walkers; Prudence Plummer-D’Amato, Lori J.P. Altmann, Kevin Reilly, 2010. </ref> . 

==Fatigue resistance== . 

Compared to young adults, old adults exhibit [[muscle fatigue]] (peripheral fatigue) resistance during sustained isometric maximal voluntary contraction, but they show greater supraspinal fatigue at start of sustained task, and during recovery. The first observation reflects changes in [[Muscle_fiber#Muscle_fibers|fiber]] type ratio; with aging the proportion of type I muscle fibers which are adapted to long effort becomes greater. The second observation is likely a result of cumulative effects of exercise on the [[central nervous system]]. <ref name="13x">Recovery from supraspinal fatigue is slowed in old adults after fatiguing maximal isometric contractions; Hunter SK, Todd G, Butler JE, Gandevia SC, & Taylor JL 2008. </ref> . 

For the knee extensors, old adults produce less torque during dynamic or isometric maximal voluntary contractions than young adults. The mechanisms controlling fatigue in the elderly during isometric contractions are not the same as those that influence fatigue during dynamic contractions, while young adults keep the same strategy. The knee extensors of healthy old adults fatigue less during isometric contractions than do those of young adults who had similar levels of habitual physical activity. In contrast, there are no differences between age groups in the fatigue during dynamic contractions. <ref name="17x">Age-related fatigue resistance in the knee extensor muscles is specific to contraction mode; Damien M. Callahan, Stephen A. Foulis, Jane A. Kent-Braun, 2009. </ref> . 

==Speed, dexterity== . 

For old adults, the decreased [[Saccade|saccadic]] accuracy, prolonged latency, and reduced saccadic velocity may be explained by cerebral cortical degeneration with age. Old adults show reduced amplitude of primary saccades and they generally more saccades to reach fixation. Old adults show significant delay of saccades in all conditions (predictable amplitude and time target steps, unpredictable amplitude target steps, unpredictabe time target steps). Age-related slowing is only evident for predictable targets; however other studies have show otherwise, but noted higher variance in speed of old adults. <ref name="15x">Senescent saccades: Effects of aging on their accuracy, latency and velocity; James A. Sharpe & David H Zackon, 1987. </ref> . 

Instructed to look either toward (pro-saccade task) or away from (anti-saccade task) an eccentric target under different conditions of fixation, for young children (5±8 years of age) a long time elapses between the apparition of the target and the onset of the eye movement (Saccadic Reaction Time). Young adults (20±30 years of age) typically have the fastest SRTs. Elderly subjects (60±79 years of age) have slower SRTs and longer duration saccades than any other age groups. <ref name="25x">Age-related performance of human subjects on saccadic eye movement task; D.P. Munoz, J.R. Broughton, J.E. Goldring, I.T. Armstrong, 1998. </ref> . 

Old adults exhibit reductions in manual dexterity which is observed through changes in [[finger]]tip force when gripping and/or lifting. Compared to young adults, old adults show an increase in grip force and safety margins (minimum force necessary to prevent a slip). These increases can be explained by skin slipperiness or it may be result of declining cutaneous information. Force increases are not associated with impaired capacity to modulate fingertip forces smoothly. There is no evidence that old adults were less able to program fingertips based on the memory of a preceding lift. <ref name="11x">Mechanisms for age-related changes of fingertip forces during precision gripping and lifting in adults; Cole KJ, Rotella DL, & Harper JG, 1999. </ref> . 

The prismatic grasp (4 fingers in opposition to thumb) which is common in everyday activities, involves the organization of the [[Finger|digits]] into specific tasks and the balance of force/moment production by individual digits. Old adults exhibit an impairment in finger and hand force production. They show excessive grip force which could be related to higher moments produced by antagonist fingers. Both can be viewed as energetically suboptimal but more stable performance. <ref name="20x">Age-related changes in finger coordination in static prehension tasks; Jae Kun Shim, Brendan S. Lay, Vladimir M. Zatsiorsky, and Mark L. Latash, 2004. </ref> . 

Old adults often show heightened antagonist muscle coactivation during goal directed movement. Contractions at moderate-to-high force often show activation of other [[Anatomical_terms_of_location#Other_directional_terms|ipsilateral]] and [[Anatomical_terms_of_location#Other_directional_terms|contralateral]] muscles. When the itensity of contralateral activity is sufficient to produce movement, this is called “mirror movement”. When asked to follow a unilateral task, young and old adults show concurrent activity in contralateral muscle but it is greater in old adults. Contralateral activity is greater for isometric than for anisometric contractions. Contralateral force is greater for [[Muscle_contraction#Eccentric_contraction|eccentric]] than [[Muscle_contraction#Concentric_contraction|concentric]] contractions. <ref name="16x">Contralateral activity in the homologous hand muscle during voluntary contractions is greater in old adults; Minoru Shinohara, Kevin G. Keenan & Roger M Enoka, 2003. </ref> . 

==Training consequences== . 

Type I muscle fiber characteristics (area, number of [[capillary]] contacts, fiber area/capillary contacts) of the [[vastus lateralis]] are unaffected by age. The old men normal fit or trained have smaller type II muscle fiber areas and fewer capillaries surrounding these fibers than do the young men. The capillary supply per unit type II fiber area is not affected by age but is enhanced by training. The old trained men have [[succinate dehydrogenase]] activities within their type IIa muscle fibers similar to those in young men and twofold higher than in old normal fit men. <ref name="6x">Oxydative capacity of human muscle fiber types: effects of age and training status; Proctor DN, Sinning WE, Walro JM, Sieck GC, Lemon PW, 1995. </ref> . 

Neural changes like reduced motor unit discharge rates, increased variability of motor unit discharge activity, altered recruitment and derecruitment behavior mediate modifications in muscle control. On the other hand, physiological deleterious factors including motor unit loss, increased motor unit innervation ratios also affect muscle force. Through [[strength training]], old adults can significantly improve their force control. The rapid adaptation suggests modifications in motor unit activation, increased excitability of [[Motor pool|motoneuron pool]], and decreased antagonist cocontraction. <ref name="14x">Adaptations in motor unit discharge activity with force control training in young and older adults; Carolynn Patten & Gary Kamen, 2000. </ref> . 

Heavy resistance and sensorimotor trainings result in increased maximum voluntary contraction and rate force development. But sensorimotor training shows more positive adaptations in postural [[reflex]]es, which is likely due to training of sensory reception/processing, central integration of afferent information, transformation of that information into adequate efferent response. The decreased onset latency and increased magnitude of reflex response with sensorimotor training is associated with increased ankle [[joint]] stiffness during perturbations. <ref name="24x">Training induced adaptations in characteristics of postural reflexes in elderly men; Granacher U, Gollhofer A, & Strass D, 2006. </ref> . 

When asked to reach a given level of force at a certain moment in time without any visual feedback, old adults are less accurate than young adults. With the practice of goal-directed contractions, old adults can improve the accuracy of novel motor tasks (isometric or dynamic) though their strategy differs from the strategy used by young adults. For both age groups, the greatest improvements in accuracy occur at the beginning of practice. <ref name="18x">Different neural adjustments improve endpoint accuracy with practice in young and old adults; Evanglos A. Christou, Brach Poston, Joel A. Enoka and Roger M. Enoka, 2007. </ref> . 

Old adults are able to improve the  modulation of grasping forces after motor practice. Unexpectedly, motor practice fails to reduce grasping performance losses under the dual-task conditions but motor practice reduces the decline in cognitive performance under dual-task conditions. Therefore motor practice seems to free up cognitive resources that were previously monitoring motor performance and old adults seemed to use these resources to improve their cognitive performance under dual-task conditions. <ref name="22x">Effect of motor practice on dual-task performance in older adults; Voelcker-Rehage C, Alberts JL, 2007. </ref> .
