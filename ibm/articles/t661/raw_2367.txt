Age is a major risk factor for most common neurodegenerative diseases, including [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[cerebrovascular disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[Lou Gehrig's disease]]. While much research has focused on diseases of aging, there are few informative studies on the molecular biology of the '''aging brain''' (spelled '''ageing brain''' in [[British English]]) in the absence of neurodegenerative disease or the neuropsychological profile of healthy older adults . However, research does suggest that the aging process is associated with several structural, chemical, and functional changes in the [[Human brain|brain]] as well as a host of neurocognitive changes. This page is devoted to reviewing the changes associated with healthy aging.  . 

==Structural Changes==. 
As people age, there are a number of changes that take place, whether physical, chemical or biological. Therefore, it is logical to assume the brain is no exception to this phenomenon. [[Computed Tomography]] (CT) studies have found that the cerebral ventricles expand as a function of age, and this process is known as [[ventriculomegaly]]. More recent [[MRI]] studies have reported age-related regional decreases in cerebral volume. <ref name="Craic">{{cite book |last=Craik |first=F. |last2=Salthouse |first2=T. |year=2000 |title=The Handbook of Aging and Cognition |edition=2nd |location=Mahwah, NJ |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum |isbn=0805829660 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Raz |first=Naftali |last2=''et al.'' |year=2005 |title=Regional Brain Changes in Aging Healthy Adults: General Trends, Individual Differences and Modifiers |journal=Cereb. Cortex |volume=15 |issue=11 |pages=1676–1689 |doi=10.1093/cercor/bhi044 }}</ref> Regional volume reduction is not uniform; some brain regions shrink at a rate of up to 1% per year, whereas others remain relatively stable until the end of the life-span. <ref>{{cite journal |last=Raz |first=Naftali |last2=Rodrigue |first2=Karen M. |year=2006 |title=Differential aging of the brain: Patterns, cognitive correlates and modifiers |journal=Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=730–748 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2006.07.001 |url=http://www.rcgd.isr.umich.edu/life/Readings2007/Raz%20reading.pdf }}</ref> The brain is very complex, and is composed of many different areas and types of tissue, or matter. The different functions of different tissues in the brain may be more or less susceptible to age-induced changes. <ref name="Craic"/>  The brain matter can be broadly classified as either [[grey matter]], or [[white matter]]. Grey matter consists of [[cell bodies]] in the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] and subcortical nuclei, whereas white matter consists of tightly packed myelinated axons connecting the neurons of the [[cerebral cortex]] to each other and with the periphery. <ref name="Craic"/> . 

===Loss of Neural Circuits and Brain Plasticity===. 
[[Brain plasticity]] refers to the brain's ability to change structure and function. <ref name="Kolb">{{cite journal |last=Kolb |first=B. |last2=Whishaw |first2=I. |year=1988 |title=Brain plasticity and behaviour |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |volume=49 |issue= |pages=43–64 |doi= }}</ref> This ties in to that old phrase, “if you don’t use it, you lose it,” which is another way of saying, if you don’t use it, your brain will devote less somatotopic space for it. One proposed mechanism for the observed age-related plasticity deficits in animals is the result of age-induced alterations in calcium regulation. <ref name="Barnes">{{cite journal |last=Barnes |first=C. |last2=Burke |first2=S. |year=2006 |title=Neural plasticity in the ageing brain |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=30–40 |doi=10.1038/nrn1809 |pmid=16371948}}</ref>  The changes in our abilities to handle calcium will ultimately influence neuronal firing and the ability to propagate [[action potentials]], which in turn would affect the ability of the brain to alter its structure or function (i.e. its plastic nature). Due to the complexity of the brain, with all of its structures and functions, it is logical to assume that some areas would be more vulnerable to aging than others. Two circuits worth mentioning here are the [[hippocampal]] and neocortical circuits. <ref name="Hof"/>  It has been suggested that age-related cognitive decline is due in part not to neuronal death but to synaptic alterations. Evidence in support of this idea from animal work has also suggested that this cognitive deficit is due to functional and [[biochemical]] factors such as changes in enzymatic activity, chemical messengers, or gene expression in cortical circuits. <ref name ="Hof"/> . 

===Thinning of the Cortex===. 
Advances in MRI technology have provided the ability to see the brain structure in great detail in an easy, non-invasive manner in vivo. <ref name="Henkenius">{{cite journal |last=Henkenius |first=A. |last2=Peterson |first2=B. |last3=''et al.'' |year=2003 |title=Mapping cortical change across the human life span |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=309–315 |doi=10.1038/nn1008 }}</ref> Bartzokis ''et al.'', has noted that there is a decrease in [[grey matter]] volume between adulthood and old age, whereas [[white matter]] volume was found to increase from age 19-40, and decline after this age. <ref name="Henkenius"/> Studies using [[Voxel-based morphometry]] have identified areas such as the [[Insular cortex|insula]] and superior parietal gyri as being especially vulnerable to age-related losses in grey matter of older adults. <ref name="Henkenius"/> Sowell ''et al.'', reported that the first 6 decades of an individual's life were correlated with the most rapid decreases in grey matter density, and this occurred over dorsal, frontal, and [[parietal lobes]] on both interhemispheric and lateral brain surfaces. It is also worth noting that areas such as the [[cingulate gyrus]], and [[occipital cortex]] surrounding the [[calcarine sulcus]] appear exempt from this decrease in grey matter density over time. <ref name="Henkenius"/>  Age effects on grey matter density in the posterior temporal cortex appear more predominantly in the left versus right hemisphere, and were confined to posterior language cortices. Certain language functions such as word retrieval and production were found to be located to more anterior language cortices, and deteriorate as a function of age. Sowell et al., also reported that these anterior language cortices were found to mature and decline earlier than the more posterior language cortices. <ref name="Henkenius"/> It has also been found that the width of [[sulcus]] not only increases with age,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tao Liu, Wei Wen, Wanlin Zhu, Julian Trollor, Simone Reppermund, John Crawford, Jesse S Jin, Suhuai Luo, Henry Brodaty, Perminder Sachdev |year=2010 |title=The effects of age and sex on cortical sulci in the elderly |journal=[[Neuroimage]] |volume=51 |issue=1 |pmid=20156569 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.02.016}}</ref> but also with cognitive decline in the elderly. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Tao Liu, Wei Wen, Wanlin Zhu, Nicole A Kochan, Julian N Trollor, Simone Reppermund, Jesse S Jin, Suhuai Luo, Henry Brodaty, Perminder S Sachdev |year=2011 |title=The relationship between cortical sulcal variability and cognitive performance in the elderly |journal=Neuroimage |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=865–873 |pmid=21397704 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.03.015}}</ref> . 

===Age-Related Neuronal Morphology===. 
There is converging evidence from cognitive neuroscientists around the world that age-induced cognitive deficits may not be due to neuronal loss or cell death, but rather may be the result of small region-specific changes to the morphology of neurons. <ref name="Barnes"/> Studies by Duan et al., have shown that dendritic arbors and [[dendritic spines]] of cortical pyramidal neurons decrease in size and/or number in specific regions and layers of human and non-human primate cortex as a result of age (Duan ''et al.'', 2003; morph). Interestingly, a 46% decrease in spine number and spine density has been reported in humans older than 50 compared with younger individuals. <ref name="Hof"/> An electron microscopy study in monkeys reported a 50% loss in spines on the apical dendritic tufts of pyramidal cells in [[prefrontal cortex]] of old animals (27–32 years old) compared with young ones (6–9 years old). <ref name="Hof"/> . 

====Neurofibrillary Tangles====. 
Age-related neuro-pathologies such as Alzheimer’s disease, [[Parkinson's disease]], [[diabetes]], [[hypertension]] and [[arteriosclerosis]] make it difficult to distinguish the normal patterns of aging. <ref name="Gabrieli">{{cite journal |last=Gabrieli |first=J. |last2=Hedden |first2=T. |year=2004 |title=Insights into the ageing mind: a view from cognitive neuroscience |journal=Nature Reviews |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=87–96 |doi=10.1038/nrn1323 |pmid=14735112}}</ref>  One of the important differences between normal aging and pathological aging is the location of [[neurofibrillary tangles]].  Neurofibrillary tangles are composed of paired helical filaments (PHF). <ref name="Anderton"/>  In normal, non-demented aging, the number of tangles in each affected cell body is relatively low<ref name="Anderton"/> and restricted to the olfactory nucleus, parahippocampal gyrus, [[amygdala]] and entorhinal cortex. <ref name="Davis">{{cite journal |last=Davis |first=P. |last2=Morris |first2=J. |last3=''et al.'' |year=1991 |title=The distribution of tangles, plaques, and related immunohistochemical markers in healthy aging and Alzheimer's disease |journal=Neurobiology of Aging |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=295–312 |doi=10.1016/0197-4580(91)90006-6 }}</ref>  As the non-demented individual ages, there is a general increase in the density of tangles, but no significant difference in '''where''' tangles are found. <ref name="Davis"/> The other main neurodegenerative contributor commonly found in the brain of patients with AD is [[amyloid plaques]].  However, unlike tangles, plaques have not been found to be a consistent feature of normal aging. <ref name="Davis"/> . 

===Role of Oxidative Stress===. 
Cognitive impairment has been attributed to [[oxidative stress]], inflammatory reactions and changes in the cerebral microvasculature. <ref name="Appleton"/>  The exact impact of each of these mechanisms in affecting cognitive aging is unknown.  Oxidative stress is the most controllable risk factor and is the best understood.  The online Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary defines oxidative stress as,  "physiological stress on the body that is caused by the cumulative damage done by [[free radicals]] inadequately neutralized by antioxidants and that is to be associated with aging."<ref>Oxidative Stress. (n.d.) In Merriam-Webster Dictionary online.  Retrieved from http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/oxidative stress</ref>  Hence oxidative stress is the damage done to the cells by free radicals that have been released from the oxidation process.  . 

Compared to other tissues in the body, the brain is deemed unusually sensitive to oxidative damage. <ref name="Butterfield">{{cite journal |last=Butterfield |first=A. |last2=Ding |first2=Q. |last3=''et al.'' |year=2005 |title=Evidence of increase oxidative damage in subjects with mild cognitive impairment |journal=Neurology |volume=64 |issue=7 |pages=1152–1156 |doi=10.1212/01.WNL.0000156156.13641.B }}</ref>  Increased oxidative damage has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases, mild [[cognitive impairment]] and individual differences in cognition in healthy elderly people.  In ‘normal aging’, the brain is undergoing oxidative stress in a multitude of ways.  The main contributors include protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation and oxidative modifications in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. <ref name="Butterfield"/>  Oxidative stress can damage DNA replication and inhibit repair through many complex processes, including [[telomere]] shortening in DNA components. <ref name="Deary">{{cite journal |last=Deary |first=I. |last2=Harris |first2=S. |last3=''et al.'' |year=2006 |title=The association between telomere length, physical health, cognitive ageing, and mortality in non-demented older people |journal=Neuroscience Letters |volume=406 |issue=3 |pages=260–264 |doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2006.07.055 }}</ref>  Each time a [[somatic cell]] replicates, the telomeric DNA component shortens.  As telomere length is partly inheritable,<ref name="Deary"/> there are individual differences in the age of onset of cognitive decline.  . 

== Chemical changes ==. 
In addition to the structural changes that the brain incurs with age, the aging process also entails a broad range of biochemical changes. More specifically, neurons communicate with each other via specialized chemical messengers called [[neurotransmitter]]s. Several studies have identified a number of these neurotransmitters, as well as their [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], that exhibit a marked alteration in different regions of the brain as part of the normal aging process.  . 

=== Dopamine ===. 
An overwhelming number of studies have reported age-related changes in [[dopamine]] synthesis, [[binding site]]s, and number of receptors.  Studies using [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) in living human subjects have shown a significant age-related decline in dopamine synthesis,<ref>{{cite book |last=Hof |first=P.

===Serotonin===. 
Decreasing levels of different [[serotonin]] receptors and the [[serotonin transporter]], 5-HTT, have also been shown to occur with age. Studies conducted using PET methods on humans, in vivo, show that levels of the S<sub>2</sub> receptor in the caudate nucleus, putamen, and frontal cerebral cortex, decline with age. <ref name="wong"/>  A decreased binding capacity of the 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor in the frontal cortex was also found,<ref name="iyo"/> as well as a decreased binding capacity of the serotonin transporter, 5-HHT, in the thalamus and the midbrain. <ref>{{cite journal |last=Yamamoto |first=M. |last2=Suhara |first2=T. |last3=Okubo |first3=Y. |last4=Ichimiya |first4=T. |last5=Sudo |first5=Y. |last6=Inoue |first6=Y. |last7=Takano |first7=A. |last8=Yasuno |first8=F. |last9=Yoshikawa |first9=K. |last10=Tanada |first10=S. |year=2001 |title=Age-related decline of serotonin transporters in living human brain of healthy males |journal=Life Sciences |volume=71 |issue= |pages=751–757 |doi= 10.1016/S0024-3205(02)01745-9|pmid=12074934 }}</ref>  Postmortem studies on humans have indicated decreased binding capacities of serotonin and a decrease in the number of S<sub>1</sub> receptors in the frontal cortex and hippocampus as well as a decrease in affinity in the putamen. <ref>{{cite journal |last=Marcusson |first=J. |last2=Oreland |first2=L. |last3=Winblad |first3=B. |year=1984 |title=Effect of age on human brain serotonin (S-1) binding sites |journal=[[Journal of Neurochemistry]] |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=1699–1705 |pmid= |doi=10.1111/j.1471-4159.1984.tb06098.x }}</ref> . 

===Glutamate===. 
[[Glutamate]] is another neurotransmitter that tends to decrease with age. <ref name="chang1">{{cite journal |last=Chang |first=L. |last2=Jiang |first2=C.

==Neuropsychological Changes==. 
===Changes in Orientation===. 
[[Orientation (mental)|Orientation]] is defined as the awareness of self in relation to one’s surroundings <ref name="Lezak">{{cite book |last=Lezak |first=M.D |last2=Howieson |first2=D.B. |last3=Loring |first3=D.W. |year=2004 |title=Neuropsychological Assessment |edition=4th |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-5-511121-7 }}</ref> Often orientation is examined by distinguishing whether a person has a sense of time, place, and person. Deficits in orientation are one of the most common symptoms of brain disease, hence tests of orientation are included in almost all medical and neuropsychological evaluations. <ref name="Alverzo">{{cite journal |last=Alverzo |first=P. |year=2006 |title=A review of the literature on orientation as an indicator of level of consciousness |journal=Journal of Nursing Scholarship |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=159–164 }}</ref> While research has primarily focused on levels of orientation among clinical populations, a small number of studies have examined whether there is a normal decline in orientation among healthy aging adults.

Some studies suggest that orientation does not decline over the lifespan. <ref name="Brotchie">{{cite journal |last=Brotchie |first=J. |last2=Brennan |first2=J.|last3=Wyke |first3=M.|year=1985 |title=Temporal orientation in the presenium and old age. |journal=British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=147 |pages=692–695 }}</ref><ref name="Hopp">{{cite journal |last=Hopp |first=G.A. |last2=Dixon |first2=R.A. |last3=Grut |first3=M. |last4=Bacekman |first4=L. |year=1997 |title=Longitudinal and psychometric profiles of two cognitive status tests in very old adults. |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology |volume=53 |pages=673–686 }}</ref> For example, in one study 92% of normal elderly adults (65–84 years) presented with perfect or near perfect orientation. <ref name="Benton">{{cite journal |last=Benton |first=A.L. |last2=Eslinger |first2=P. |last3=Damasio |first3=A. |year=1981 |title=Normative observations on neuropsychological test performances in old age. |journal=Journal of Clinical Neuropsychology |volume=3 |pages=33–42 }}</ref> However some data suggest that mild changes in orientation may be a normal part of aging. <ref name="Ishizaki">{{cite journal |last=Ishizaki |first=J. |last2=Meguro |first2=K. |last3=Ambo |first3=H. |last4=Shimada |first4=M. |last5=Yamaguchi |first5=S. |last6=Harasaka |first6=C. |last7=et al. |year=1998 |title=A normative community based study of mini-mental state in elderly adults: The effect of age and educational level. |journal=Journal of Gerontology |volume=53 |pages=359–363 }}</ref><ref name="Sweet">{{cite journal |last=Sweet |first=J.J. |last2=Such |first2=Y. |last3=Leahy |first3=B. |last4=Abramowitz |first4 = C. |last5=Nowinski |first5=C.J. |year=1999 |title=Normative clinical relationships between orientation and memory: Age as an important moderator variable. |journal=The Clinical Neuropsychologist. |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=495–508 }}</ref> For example, Sweet and colleagues concluded that “older persons with normal, healthy memory may have mild orientation difficulties. In contrast, younger people with normal memory have virtually no orientation problems” <ref name="Sweet"/> (p.&nbsp;505). So although current research suggests that normal aging is not usually associated with significant declines in orientation, mild difficulties may be a part of normal aging and not necessarily a sign of pathology.  . 

===Changes in Attention===. 
Many older adults notice a decline in their attentional abilities. <ref name="Kensinger">{{cite book |last=Kensinger |first=E.A |year=2009 |title=Cognition in aging and age related disease. In P. R. Hof & C. V. Mobbs (Eds.), Handbook of the neuroscience of aging (249-256). |location=London |publisher=Elsevier Press}}</ref> Attention is a broad construct that refers to “the cognitive ability that allows us to deal with the inherent processing limitations of the human brain by selecting information for further processing” (p.&nbsp;334). <ref name="Banich">{{cite book |last=Banich |first=M. T. |last2=Compton |first2=R. J. |year=2011 |title=Cognitive neuroscience |location=Belmont,CA |publisher= Wadsworth}}</ref> Since the human brain has limited resources, people use their attention to zone in on specific stimuli and block out others.  . 

If older adults have fewer attentional resources than younger adults, we would expect that when two tasks must be carried out at the same time, older adults’ performance will decline more than that of younger adults. However, a large review of studies on cognition and aging suggest that this hypothesis has not been wholly supported. <ref name="Light">{{cite journal |last=Light |first=L.L. |year=1991 |title=Memory and aging: Four hypotheses in search of data |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |volume=42 |pages=333–376}}</ref> While some studies have found that older adults have a more difficult time encoding and retrieving information when their attention is divided, other studies have not found meaningful differences from younger adults. Similarly, one might expect older adults to do poorly on tasks of sustained attention, which measure the ability to attend to and respond to stimuli for an extended period of time. However, studies suggest that sustained attention shows no decline with age. Results suggest that sustained attention increases in early adulthood and then remains relatively stable, at least through the seventh decade of life. <ref name="Carriere">{{cite journal |last=Carrier |first=J. S. A. |last2=Cheyne |first2=A. |last3=Solman |first3=G. J. F. |last4=Smilek |first4=D. |year=2010 |title=Age trends for failures of sustained attention |journal=Psychology and Aging |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=569–574}}</ref> More research is needed on how normal aging impacts attention after age eighty.  . 

It is worth noting that there are factors other than true attentional abilities that might relate to difficulty paying attention. For example, it is possible that sensory deficits impact older adults’ attentional abilities. In other words, impaired hearing or vision may make it more difficult for older adults to do well on tasks of visual and verbal attention. <ref name="Kensinger"/> . 

=== Changes in memory ===. 
There have been many different types of memory identified in humans, such as episodic, semantic, strategic, working, source spatial, and non-declarative. <ref name="Craic"/> Studies done by Rapp ''et al.'', have found that memory functions, more specifically those associated with the [[medial temporal lobe]] are especially vulnerable to age-related decline. <ref name="Hof">{{cite journal |last=Hof |first=P. |last2=Morrison |first2=J. |year=2004 |title=The aging brain: morphomolecular senescence of cortical circuits |journal=Trends in Neuroscience |volume=27 |issue=10 |pages=607–613 |doi=10.1016/j.tins.2004.07.013 }}</ref> A number of studies utilizing a variety of methods such as [[histological]], structural imaging, [[functional imaging]], and [[receptor binding]] have supplied converging evidence that the [[frontal lobe]]s and frontal-striatal dopaminergic pathways are especially affected by age-related processes resulting in memory changes. <ref name="Craic"/> . 

== Genetic changes ==. 
Variation in the effects of aging among individuals can be attributed to both genetic and environmental factors. As in so many other science disciplines, the [[nature versus nurture debate]] is an ongoing conflict in the field of [[cognitive neuroscience]]. <ref name="Gabrieli"/><ref name="Anderton">{{cite journal |last=Anderton |first=B. |year=2002 |title=Ageing of the brain |journal=Mechanisms of Ageing and Development |volume=123 |issue=7 |pages=811–817 |doi=10.1016/S0047-6374(01)00426-2 }}</ref> The search for genetic factors has always been an important aspect in trying to understand neuro-pathological processes. Research focused on discovering the genetic component in developing AD has also contributed greatly to the understanding the genetics behind normal or “non-pathological” aging. <ref name="Anderton"/> . 

The human brain shows a decline in function and a change in [[gene expression]]. This modulation in gene expression may be due to [[oxidative]] [[DNA damage]] at [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] regions in the genome.  Genes that are down-regulated over the age of 40 include: . 

* GluR1 [[AMPA receptor]] [[Protein subunit|subunit]]
* [[NMDA receptor|NMDA]] [[NR2A|R2A]] receptor subunit (involved in [[memory|learning]])
* Subunits of the [[GABA A receptor|GABA-A receptor]]
* Genes involved in [[long-term potentiation]] e.g. [[calmodulin]] 1 and [[Protein kinase#Ca2.2B.2Fcalmodulin-dependent protein kinases|CAM kinase II]] alpha. 
* Calcium signaling genes
* Synaptic plasticity genes
* Synaptic vesicle release and recycling genes . 

Genes that are upregulated include: . 

* Genes associated with [[stress response]] and [[DNA repair]]
* [[Antioxidant]] defence . 

==Delaying the Effects of Aging==. 
The process of aging may be inevitable, however one may potentially delay the effects and severity of this progression. 
While there is no consensus of efficacy, the following are reported as delaying cognitive decline: 
* High level of education <ref name="Anderton"/><ref name="Scarmeas"/>
* Physical exercise <ref name="Baker">{{cite journal |last=Baker |first=L.D. |last2= Frank |first2=L.L. |last3=Foster-Schubert |first3=K. |last4=Green |first4=P.S. |last5=Wilinson |first5=C.W. |last6=McTiernan |first6=A. |last7=et al. |year=2010 |title= Effects of aerobic exercise on mile cognitive impairment: A controlled trial |journal= Archives of Neurology |volume= 67 |pages= 71–79 |url= http://archneur.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/67/1/71 |issue=1}}</ref>
* Staying intellectually engaged i.e. Reading and mental activities (such as crossword puzzles) <ref name="Hall">{{cite journal |last=Hall |first=C.B. |last2= Lipton |first2= R. B. |last3=Sliwinski |first3= M. |last4=Katz |first4=M. J. |last5= Derby |first5=C.

* Maintaining social and friendship networks <ref name="Barnes2">{{cite journal |last=Barnes |first=L. L. |last2=Mendes de Leon |first2=C.F. |last3=Wilson |first3= R. S. |last4= Bienias |first4= J.

* Maintaining a healthy diet, including omega-3 fatty acids, and protective antioxidants. <ref name="Gabrieli"/> . 

==="Super Agers"=== . 

Longitudinal research studies have recently conducted genetic analyses of centenarians and their offspring to identify biomarkers as protective factors against the negative effects of aging. In particular, the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene is linked to prevention of cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease. <ref>{{cite journal |last=Sanders |first=Amy |last2=Wang |first2=Cuiling |last3=Katz |first3=Mindy |last4=Derby |first4=Carol |last5=Barzilai |first5=Nir |year=2011 |title= Association of a functional polymorphism in the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene with memory decline and incidence of dementia |journal= Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=303 |issue=2 |pages=150–158 |doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1988 |url= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.flagship.luc.edu/pmc/articles/PMC3047443}}</ref> Specifically, valine CETP homozygotes but not heterozygotes experienced a relative 51% less decline in memory compared to a reference group after adjusting for demographic factors and APOE status.  . 

===Cognitive Reserve=== . 

The ability of an individual to demonstrate no cognitive signs of aging despite an aging brain is called [[cognitive reserve]]. <ref name="Appleton">{{cite journal |last=Appleton |first=C. |last2=Deary |first2=I. |last3=''et al.'' |year=2004 |title=Cognitive reserve and the neurobiology of cognitive ageing |journal=Ageing Research Reviews |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=369–382 |doi=10.1016/j.arr.2004.05.001 }}</ref><ref name="Scarmeas">{{cite journal |last=Scarmeas |first=N. |last2=Stern |first2=Y. |year=2003 |title=Cognitive reserve and lifestyle |journal=Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=625–633 |doi=10.1076/jcen.25.5.625.14576 |pmid=12815500 |pmc=3024591}}</ref>  This hypothesis suggests that two patients might have the same brain pathology, with one person experiencing noticeable clinical symptoms, while the other continues to function relatively normally.  Studies of cognitive reserve explore the specific biological, genetic and environmental differences which make one person susceptible to cognitive decline, and allow another to age more gracefully.  . 

===Nun Study=== . 

A study funded by the National Institute of Aging followed a group of 678 Roman Catholic sisters and recorded the effects of aging. The researchers used autobiographical essays collected as the nuns joined their Sisterhood. Findings suggest that early idea density, defined by number of ideas expressed and use of complex prepositions in these essays, was a significant predictor of lower risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease in old age.  Lower idea density was found to be significantly associated with lower brain weight, higher brain atrophy, and more neurofibrillary tangles <ref>Riley KP, Snowdon DA, Desrosiers MF, Markesbery WR: Early life linguistic ability, late life cognitive function, and neuropathology: Findings from the Nun Study Neurobiology of Aging 26(3):341347, 2005. </ref> .
