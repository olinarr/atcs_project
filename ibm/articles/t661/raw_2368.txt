One of the key concerns of older adults is the experience of [[memory loss]], especially as it is one of the hallmark symptoms of [[Alzheimer's disease]]. However, memory loss is qualitatively different in normal [[aging]] from the kind of memory loss associated with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Budson AE, Price BH |title=Memory dysfunction |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=352 |issue=7 |pages=692–9 |year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15716563 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra041071 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&pmid=15716563&promo=ONFLNS19 }}</ref> Occasional lapses in memory are normal in aging adults, and understanding the distinction between normal symptoms and warning signs of Alzheimer’s is critical in maintaining cognitive health.  . 

== Mild cognitive impairment == . 

Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a condition in which people face memory problems more often than the average person their age. These symptoms, however, do not prevent them from carrying out normal activities and are not as severe as the symptoms for Alzheimer's disease. Symptoms often include misplacing items, forgetting events or appointments, and having trouble thinking of desired words. <ref>http://www.nia.nih.gov/health/publication/forgetfulness-knowing-when-ask-help</ref> . 

Recent research has identified a transitional state between the cognitive changes of normal aging and [[Alzheimer's disease]] (AD), known as [[mild cognitive impairment]] (MCI). Many people who experience mild cognitive impairment are at a high risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Several studies have indicated that MCI individuals are at an increased risk for developing AD, ranging from 1% to 25% per year; 24% of MCI patients progressed to AD in 2 years and 20% more over 3 years, whereas a recent study indicated that the progression of MCI subjects was 55% in 4.5 years. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Arnáiz E, Almkvist O |title=Neuropsychological features of mild cognitive impairment and preclinical Alzheimer's disease |journal=Acta Neurol. Scand., Suppl. |volume=179 |issue= |pages=34–41 |year=2003 |pmid=12603249 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0404.107.s179.7.x}}</ref> Some patients with MCI, however, never progress to AD.  . 

Studies have also indicated that much like patients with Alzheimer's disease, those suffering from Mild Cognitive Impairment have difficulty accurately defining words and using them appropriately in sentences when asked. While MCI patients had a lower performance in this task than the control group, AD patients performed worse overall. The abilities of MCI patients stood out, however, due to providing examples to make up for their difficulties. AD patients failed to use any compensatory strategies and therefore exhibited the difference in use of episodic memory and executive functioning. <ref>http://0-www.sciencedirect.com.helin.uri.edu/science/article/pii/S0911604412000115</ref> . 

== Memory decline in normal aging == . 

Normal aging is associated with a decline in various memory abilities in many cognitive tasks; the phenomenon is known as age-related memory impairment (AMI) or age-associated memory impairment (AAMI). The ability to encode new memories of events or facts and [[working memory]] shows decline in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Hedden T, Gabrieli JD |title=Insights into the ageing mind: a view from cognitive neuroscience |journal=Nat. Rev. Neurosci. |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=87–96 |year=2004 |month=February |pmid=14735112 |doi=10.1038/nrn1323}}</ref> Studies comparing the effects of aging on [[episodic memory]], [[semantic memory]], [[short-term memory]] and [[priming]] find that episodic memory is especially impaired in normal aging; some types of short-term memory are also impaired. <ref name=Nilsson>{{cite journal |author=Nilsson LG |title=Memory function in normal aging |journal=Acta Neurol. Scand., Suppl. |volume=179 |issue= |pages=7–13 |year=2003 |pmid=12603244 }}</ref> The deficits may be related to impairments seen in the ability to refresh recently processed information. <ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00411 |author=Johnson MK, Reeder JA, Raye CL, Mitchell KJ |title=Second thoughts versus second looks: An age-related deficit in selectively refreshing just-active information |journal=Psychological Science |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=64–7 |year=2002 |url=http://memlab1.eng.yale.edu/PDFs/2002_Johnson_Reeder_Raye_PsychSci.pdf |pmid=11892780}}</ref> Source information is one type of episodic memory that suffers with old age; this kind of knowledge includes where and when the person learned the information. Knowing the source and context of information can be extremely important in daily decision-making, so this is one way in which memory decline can affect the lives of the elderly. Therefore, reliance on political stereotypes is one way to use their knowledge about the sources when making judgments, and the use of metacognitive knowledge gains importance. <ref>{{cite web|last=Kuhlmann|first=Beatrice|title=Older Adults' Use of Metacognitive Knowledge in Source Monitoring: Spared Monitoring but Impaired Control|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/pag/26/1/143.pdf|work=Psychology and Aging|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=9 May 2011}}</ref> This deficit may be related to declines in the ability to bind information together in memory during encoding and retrieve those associations at a later time. <ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0278-7393.26.5.1170 |author=Naveh-Benjamin M |title=Adult age differences in memory performance: tests of an associative deficit hypothesis |journal=J Exp Psychol Learn Mem Cogn |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=1170–87 |year=2000 |month=September |pmid=11009251 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/xlm/26/5/1170}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0882-7974.15.3.527 |author=Mitchell KJ, Johnson MK, Raye CL, Mather M, D'Esposito M |title=Aging and reflective processes of working memory: binding and test load deficits |journal=Psychol Aging |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=527–41 |year=2000 |month=September |pmid=11014715 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/pag/15/3/527}}</ref> . 

Episodic memory is supported by networks spanning frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes. The interconnections in the lobes are presumed to enable distinct aspects of memory, whereas the effects of gray matter lesions have been extensively studied, less is known about the interconnecting fiber tracts. In aging, degradation of white matter structure has emerged as an important general factor, further focusing attention on the critical white matter connections.  . 

In particular, associative learning, which is another type of episodic memory, is vulnerable to the effects of aging, and this has been demonstrated across various study paradigms. <ref name="Light">{{cite web|last=Light|first=Leah|title=Memory and Aging: Four Hypotheses in Search of Data|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.ps.42.020191.002001|work=Annu. Rev. Psychol.|publisher=Annual Reviews Inc|accessdate=9 May 2011}}</ref> This has been explained by the Associative Deficit Hypothesis (ADH), which states that aging it associated with a deficiency in creating and retrieving links between single units of information. This can include knowledge about context, events or items. The ability to bind pieces of information together with their episodic context in a coherent whole has been reduced in the elderly population. <ref>{{cite web|last=Provyn|first=Jennifer|title=Effects of Age on Contextually Mediated Associations in Paired Associate Learnin|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/pag/22/4/846.html|work=Psychology and Aging|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=9 May 2011}}</ref> Furthermore, the older adults’ performances in free recall involved temporal contiguity to a lesser extent than for younger people, indicating that associations regarding contiguity become weaker with age. <ref>{{cite web|last=Kahana|first=Michael|title=Age Dissociates Recency and Lag Recency Effects in Free Recall|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xlm/28/3/530.pdf|work=Journal of Experimental Psychology|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=9 May 2011}}</ref> . 

Several reasons have been speculated as to why older adults use less effective encoding and retrieval strategies as they age. The first is the “disuse” view, which states that memory strategies are used less by older adults as they move further away from the educational system. Second is the “diminished attentional capacity” hypothesis, which means that older people engage less in self-initiated encoding due to reduced attentional capacity. The third reason is the “memory self-efficacy,” which indicates that older people do not have confidence in their own memory performances, leading to poor consequences. <ref name="Light"/> It is known that patients with Alzheimer’s disease and patients with semantic dementia both exhibit difficulty in tasks that involve picture naming and category fluency. This is tied to damage to their semantic network, which stores knowledge of meanings and understandings.  . 

A biological explanation for memory deficits in aging includes a postmortem examination of five brains of elderly people with better memory than average. These people are called the "super aged,” and it was found that these individuals had less fiber-like tangles of tau protein than in typical elderly brains. However, a similar amount of amyloid plaque was found. <ref>EurekAlert. [http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-11/nu-ab111308.php 'Super-aged' brains reveal first secrets of sharp memory in old age]. </ref> . 

== Possible Causes of Memory Decline == . 

People commonly associate memory lapses in their mid-30s, 40s, or 50s as a sign of Alzheimer’s diesease as they approach later adulthood, but this is not true. Memory lapses can be both aggravating and frustrating but they are due to the overwhelming amount of information that is being taken in by the brain. If there are distractions in the background while you are trying to pay bills or talk to someone on the phone you are more apt to forget because you may not be making memories properly. Rather, issues in memory can be linked to several physical and psychological causes, such as: anxiety, dehydration, depression, infections, medication side effects, poor nutrition, vitamin B12 deficiency, psychological stress, substance abuse, chronic alcoholism, thyroid imbalances, and blood clots in the brain.  Taking care of your body and mind with appropriate medication, doctoral check-ups, and daily mental and physical exercise can avoid unwanted memory issues. <ref>http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/memory-and-aging.pdf</ref> . 

Some memory issues are due to stress, anxiety, or depression. A traumatic life event, such as the death of a spouse, can lead to changes in lifestyle and can leave an elderly person feeling unsure of themselves, sad, and lonely. Dealing with such drastic life changes can therefore leave some people confused or forgetful. While in some cases these feelings may fade, it is important to take these emotional problems seriously. By emotionally supporting a struggling relative and seeking help from a doctor or counselor, the forgetfulness can be improved. <ref>http://www.nia.nih.gov/health/publication/forgetfulness-knowing-when-ask-help</ref> . 

== Prevention and treatment == . 

Various actions have been suggested to prevent memory loss or even improve memory.  . 

The Mayo Clinic has suggested seven steps: stay mentally active, socialize regularly, get organized, eat a healthy diet, include physical activity in your daily routine, and manage chronic conditions. <ref>{{cite web|last=Mayo Clinic Staff|title=Memory loss: 7 tips to improve your memory|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/memory-loss/HA00001/METHOD=print|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=9 May 2011}}</ref> Because some of the causes of memory loss include medications, stress, depression, heart disease, alcohol abuse, thyroid problems, vitamin B12 deficiency, not drinking enough water, and not eating nutritiously, fixing those problems could be a simple, effective way to slow down dementia. Some say that exercise is the best way to prevent memory problems, because that would increase blood flow to the brain and perhaps help new brain cells grow. A healthy diet is also critical, partly because it has been demonstrated that healthy eaters are much less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease. <ref>{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Liz|title=Fighting memory loss through brain games, exercise and rest|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/2003554106_liztaylor05.html|work=The Seattle Times|publisher=The Seattle Times Company|accessdate=9 May 2011}}</ref> . 

The treatment will depend on the cause of memory loss, but various drugs to treat Alzheimer’s disease have been suggested in recent years. There are four drugs currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of Alzheimer’s, and they all act on the cholinergic system: Donepezil (Aricept), Galantamine (Reminyl), Rivastigmine (Exelon), and Tacrine (Cognex). Although these medications are not the cure for Alzheimer’s, symptoms may be reduced for up to eighteen months for mild or moderate dementia. These drugs do not forestall the ultimate decline to full Alzheimer's. <ref>{{cite web|title=Improving Memory and Treating Memory Loss |url=http://www.intelihealth.com/IH/ihtPrint/WSIHW000/31393/31399/347199.html?d=dmtContent&hide=t&k=basePrint|publisher=Harvard Medical School|accessdate=9 May 2011}}</ref> . 

Also, modality is important in determining the strength of the memory.  For instance, auditory creates stronger memory abilities than visual.  This is shown by the higher recency and primacy effects of an auditory recall test compared to that of a visual test. Research has shown that auditory training, through instrumental musical activity or practice, can help preserve memory abilities as one ages.  Specifically, in Hanna-Pladdy and McKay's experiment, they tested and found that the # of years of musical training, all things equal, leads to a better performance in non-verbal memory and increases the life span on cognition abilities in one's advanced years. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Hanna-Pladdy|first=Brenda|coauthors=MacKay, Alicia|title=The relation between instrumental musical activity and cognitive aging|journal=Neuropsychology|year=2011|month=May|volume=25|pages=378–386|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&id=D4C767C3-DCB4-5884-A782-94E9D7D3870B&resultID=2&page=1&dbTab=all|doi=10.1037/a0021895|pmid=21463047|issue=3}}</ref> . 

Another important aspect that helps memory as one ages is spacing.  Spacing improves and facilitates the inductive and repetition learning, while mass learning is not helpful in improving memory (which is contrary to what the participants thought).  . 

The use of memory aids is helpful in fighting cognitive signs of aging.  Keeping a "to do" list will help assure that certain tasks are completed and not forgotten.  Establishing day-to-day routines will make everyday tasks, such as taking medication, easier to remember if they occur at the same time everyday.  Putting everything it its rightful place will help to avoid confusion.  Keeping important items in a place where they can always be seen will save you time when they're needed.  Using simple  associations to remember names, events, or objects can make recalling things much easier. Finally, keeping a calendar to display important dates and times will make remembering much easier.  . 

== Caregiving and Daily Life == . 

Caring for an adult with memory issues can be a day to day struggle.  Every task can become an extreme chore if not approached and handled correctly.  By keeping the patient active, focusing on their positive abilities, and avoiding stress, these tasks can easily be accomplished.  Routines for bathing and dressing must be organized in a way so that the patient still feels a sense of independence.  Simple approaches such as finding clothes with large buttons, elastic waist bands, or velcro straps can ease the struggles of getting dressed in the morning.  Further, finances must be managed.  Changing passwords to prevent over-use and involving a trusting family member or friend in managing accounts can prevent financial issues.  When household chores begin to pile up, find ways to break down large tasks into small, manageable steps that can be rewarded.  Finally, talking and visiting a family member or friend with memory issues is very important.  Using a respectful and simple approach, talking one-on-one can ease the pain of social isolation and bring much mental stimulation.  <ref>http://memory.ucsf.edu/caregiving/tips</ref> . 

The most important thing to remember when caring for an adult with memory issues is to give them independence in a respectful manner.  Finding tasks for them, keeping their mind busy, and rewarding them for a job well done will promote a desire for mentally stimulating activities.   . 

== Invertebrate models == . 

There are several model systems for AMI, including nematodes, flies and bees. In the nematode, ''C. elegans'', AMI includes age-related changes in associative learning and memory that are modulated by insulin/IGF-1 signal and serotonin/octomamine signal <ref>Murakami H, Bessinger K, Hellmann J, Murakami S.

== Domains of memory mostly spared == . 

In contrast, implicit, or [[procedural memory]], typically shows no decline with age. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Fleischman DA, Wilson RS, Gabrieli JD, Bienias JL, Bennett DA |title=A longitudinal study of implicit and explicit memory in old persons |journal=Psychol Aging |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=617–25 |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15584787 |doi=10.1037/0882-7974.19.4.617 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/pag/19/4/617}}</ref> Other types of short-term memory show little decline,<ref name=Nilsson/> and semantic knowledge (e.g. vocabulary) actually improves with age. <ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0882-7974.18.2.332 |author=Verhaeghen P |title=Aging and vocabulary scores: a meta-analysis |journal=Psychol Aging |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=332–9 |year=2003 |month=June |pmid=12825780 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/pag/18/2/332}}</ref> In addition, the enhancement seen in [[memory]] for emotional events is also maintained with age. <ref name=MatherCarstensen>{{cite journal |author=Mather M, Carstensen LL |title=Aging and motivated cognition: the positivity effect in attention and memory |journal=Trends Cogn. Sci. (Regul. Ed.) |volume=9 |issue=10 |pages=496–502 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16154382 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2005.08.005 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1364-6613(05)00237-8}}</ref> . 

Recently, experiments that have tested for the significant of under performance of memory for an older adult group as compared to a young adult group, hypothesized that the deficit in associate memory due to age can be linked with a physical deficit.  This deficit can be explained by the inefficient processing in the medial-temporal regions.  This region is important in episodic memory, which is one of the two types of long-term human memory, and it contains the hippocampi, which is crucial in creating memorial association between items. 
<ref>{{cite journal|last=Craik|first=Fergus I. M.|coauthors=Luo, Lin; Sakuta, Yuiko|title=Effects of aging and divided attention on memory for items and their contexts|journal=Psychology and Aging|year=2010|month=Dec|volume=25|issue=4|pages=968–979|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&id=D4D2BB79-0414-E419-7230-CB27AD08021D&resultID=15&page=1&dbTab=all|doi=10.1037/a0020276|pmid=20973605}}</ref> . 

== Theories about memory and aging == . 

First, the tests and data that show that as people age, the contiguity effect weakens.  This is supported by the associative deficit theory of memory, which asserts old people's poor memory performance is attributed to their difficulty in creating and retaining cohesive episodes.  The supporting research in this test, after controlling for sex, education, and other health-related issues, show that greater age was associated with lower hit and greater false alarm rates, and also a more liberal bias response on recognition tests. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Bender|first=AR|title=Associative Deficit in Recognition Memory in a Lifespan Sample of Healthy Adults|journal=Psycholy Aging|year=2010|month=Dec|volume=25|issue=4|pages=940–948|pmid=20822256|doi=10.1037/a0020595|last2=Naveh-Benjamin|first2=M|last3=Raz|first3=N|pmc=3011045}}</ref>
Second, the higher tendency for older people to make outside intrusions during a memory test can be attributed to the inhibition effect.  Inhibition caused participants to take longer time in recalling or recognizing an item, and also subjected the participants to make more frequent errors.  For instance, in a study using metaphors as the test subject, older participants rejected correct metaphors more often than literally false statements. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Morrone|first=Isabella|coauthors=Declercq, Christelle|title=Aging and inhibition processes: The case of metaphor treatment|journal=Psychology and Aging|year=2010|month=Sep|volume=25|issue=3|pages=697–701|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&id=D5439120-A515-349C-CFAC-1123F07AD444&resultID=25&page=1&dbTab=all|doi=10.1037/a0019578|pmid=20853972}}</ref> . 

== Qualitative changes == . 

Most research on memory and aging has focused on how older adults perform less well at a particular memory task.  However, recently researchers have also discovered that simply saying that older adults are doing the same thing, only less of it, is not always accurate.  In some cases, older adults seem to be using different strategies than younger adults.  For example, brain imaging studies have revealed that older adults are more likely to use both hemispheres when completing memory tasks than younger adults. <ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0882-7974.17.1.85 |author=Cabeza R |title=Hemispheric asymmetry reduction in older adults: the HAROLD model |journal=Psychol Aging |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=85–100 |year=2002 |month=March |pmid=11931290 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/pag/17/1/85}}</ref> In addition, older adults sometimes show a [[positivity effect]] when remembering information, which seems to be a result of the increased focus on regulating emotion seen with age. <ref name=MatherCarstensen/> For instance, [[eye tracking]] reveals that older adults showed preferential looking toward happy faces and away from sad faces. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Isaacowitz DM, Wadlinger HA, Goren D, Wilson HR |title=Selective preference in visual fixation away from negative images in old age? An eye-tracking study |journal=Psychol Aging |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=40–8 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16594790 |doi=10.1037/0882-7974.21.1.40 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/pag/21/1/40}}</ref> .
