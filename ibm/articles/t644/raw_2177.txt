An '''after-school activity''' is any organized program which invites youth to participate outside of the traditional school day. Some programs are run by a [[primary school|primary]] or [[secondary school]] and some by externally funded non-profit or commercial organizations. These after-school youth programs can occur inside a school building or elsewhere in the community, for instance at a [[community center]], [[library]], [[park]], etc. These activities are a cornerstone of [[concerted cultivation]], giving children experience with leadership and dealing with adults. <ref name="organizedcontext" /> Such children are believed by proponents to be more successful in later life, while others consider too many activities to indicate [[overparenting]].  . 

== Typical activities == . 

There are a myriad of organized after-school activities for children including, for example:
* [[Sports]] such as [[soccer]], [[baseball]], [[kick scooter|scooter racing]], [[hockey]], [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]]
* [[Performing arts]] such as [[dance]], [[drama]] and [[ballet]]
* [[Creative arts]] such as [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[craft]]s
* [[Cramming school]]s for literacy, mathematics, etc. 
* [[Scouting]], [[Girl Guides]], [[Boys and Girls Club of America]], [[Boys' Brigade]], [[cadet]]s . 

== Filling time == . 

Many of these activities take place in the afternoons of school days, thereby helping parents with [[childcare]] before they finish work. They can also occur in the evening and [[Workweek|weekends]].  . 

The motivation for participating in an after-school activity is often that working parents wish their children to be supervised. <ref name="organizedcontext">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pQ2HAS9RmtUC&lpg=PA1999&pg=RA1-PA45#v=onepage&q=&f=false|title=Organized activities as contexts of development: extracurricular activities, after-school and community programs|first=Joseph L.|last=Mahoney|first2=Reed|last2=Larson|first3=Jacquelynne S.|last3=Eccles|year=2005|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|pages=550|page=45|isbn=0-8058-4431-7}}</ref> Proponents often believe that if unsupervised, children may fall into criminal or undesirable activity such as [[drug]]-taking or teenage-sex. <ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/html/ojjdp/nationalreport99/chapter3.pdf#page=15|title=Juvenile Offenders and Victims: 1999 National Report|first=Howard N.

In the United States, after school programs are increasing in number and popularity due to rising support from states and the federal government. Interest in utilizing after school programs for delinquent prevention increased dramatically after research found that juvenile arrest rates peak between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. on school days. <ref>Frabutt, J. 2004. Do after school programs reduce delinquency? Retrieved from http://durhamnc.gov/ich/op/DPD/Documents/after_school_fact_sheet.pdf</ref> 
By keeping students involved in school related activities it lessens the chance for them to get involved in crimes, use drugs, tobacco or alcohol. <ref name="Hirsch, B. J. 2011">Hirsch, B. J. (2011). Learning and Development in After-School Programs. Phi Delta Kappan, 92(5), 66-69. </ref> After school programs give students role models and a safe place to learn and play. Some parents may place children in after school programs so that their children are provided with opportunities for enrichment or academic improvement. Other parents are predominantly concerned with ensuring that their children are in an affordable, safe, supervised environment after school <ref>Wu, H., & Van Egeren, L. A. (2010). Voluntary Participation and Parents' Reasons for Enrollment in After-School Programs: Contributions of Race/Ethnicity, Program Quality, and Program Policies. Journal Of Leisure Research,42(4), 591-620)</ref> . 

== Independence == . 

Advocates of [[slow parenting]] believe that children should be allowed to develop their own ideas. <ref name="underpressure">{{cite book|title=Under Pressure: Rescuing Our Children From The Culture Of Hyper-Parenting|first=Carl|last=Honor√©|publisher=Orion|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7528-7531-6}}</ref> Getting bored is a step towards having an idea for something else to do. Having no adult organizers allows the children to find their own structure.  . 

In her book ''[[The Price of Privilege]]'',<ref>{{cite book| last = Levine | first = Madeline | title = The Price of Privilege: How Parental Pressure and Material Advantage Are Creating a Generation of Disconnected and Unhappy Kids | publisher = [[Harper Collins]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-06-059584-5 | pages = 256 }}</ref> psychologist [[Madeline Levine]] found that children of wealthy families were more likely to suffer psychological dysfunctions such as anxiety and depression. By spending so much time in organized after-school activities, and missing out on time or emotional closeness with their families, they fail to develop self management which is a powerful precursor to both psychological inner strength and academic achievement.  . 

Not all children fit ideally within any single mould. While there may be some that benefit from being supervised and pushed towards [[didacticism|didactic]] goals, others will end up achieving more on their own, or with minimal supervision according to the Chinese philosophy of [[wu wei]].  . 

== Management == . 

Some after-school activities are provided free of charge at the point of delivery, while the majority are for-profit businesses which charge for membership. They are sometimes government-funded, especially where it is  believed that the parents may not be providing a good home environment, and so professional care may be better.  . 

== Local regions == . 

After-school activities are organized differently around the world.  . 

=== United Kingdom === . 

After-school activities in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] are typically organised commercially and paid for by parents. Many children attend several a week, and occasionally even more than one per day. Similar activities also occur at weekends.  . 

There is typically less focus on the managed "enrichment" than in the USA, beyond the basic choice of activity; for example [[Association football|football]] (soccer) is physically active and develops teamwork.  . 

=== United States === . 

A number of states have organizations that work to give local after-school providers resources and training. For instance, the [[Rhode Island]] Afterschool Plus Alliance and the [http://www.afterschoolnetwork.org California Afterschool Network] provide resources on the state level. On the national level, the [[Afterschool Alliance]] serves as a national advocate for after-school activities. <ref>http://www.afterschoolalliance.org/aboutUs.cfm</ref> . 

In [[California]], after-school programming at the secondary level is funded primarily with [http://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/ba/cp/ 21st Century High School ASSETS (After School Safety and Enrichment for Teens)] program grants. These grants stipulate programs must include academic, enrichment, and health and nutrition components.   . 

The after-school programs at California's elementary schools are predominately funded with [http://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/ba/as/ ASES (After-School Education & Safety) Program] grants mandated when voters statewide approved [[California's Proposition 49 (2002)]].  These grants provide for much of what the ASSETS grants provide at the secondary level, though there is an added family literacy component.  . 

Throughout Southern California, non-profit providers work in partnership with school districts to provide after-school programs for k-12 students.  Typically school districts apply for the grants to fund the local after-school programs.  Then districts either elect to manage those program internally or outsource management to a [[Community-based organization]] (CBO), [[Non-governmental organization]] (NGO) or other local non-profit provider. [http://btb.lausd.net/home/ Beyond the Bell] is a district run and managed after-school program offered to students in the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]] (LAUSD). [http://www.THINKtogether.org THINK Together, Inc.], California's largest non-profit provider, contracts with approximately 20 Southern California school district partners to run and manage academically oriented after-school programs at approximately 200 school sites located across Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties.  . 

After school programs are very common today in the United States. The 40 largest national youth organizations today have a total membership of about 40 million youths. These programs have shown results of better test scores, improved homework completion, higher grades, and even the psychosocial development of the student. <ref name="Hirsch, B. J. 2011"/> There are many different after school programs that are implemented in the United States.  The Boys & Girls Clubs of America focus mainly on positive youth development. Their staff provides information, guidance, and emotional support regarding a wide range of issues that youths face in often high-risk neighborhoods <ref name="Hirsch, B. J. 2011"/> Beans and Rice Organization is a community economic development organization that builds assets and develops capacities in low and moderate income families through economic and educational programs. Beans and Rice offers afterschool programs in Pulaski, VA and Radford, Va. Volunteers for Beans and Rice serve as mentors, tutors, and teachers. All volunteers receive training and close supervision from both Beans and Rice staff and experienced volunteers. Elementary students who participate in the Beans and Rice after school programs are given snack, tutoring, active play opportunities, and positive role models. <ref>www.beansandrice.org</ref> Volunteering for Beans and Rice is required by all students taking Math 312 at Radford University.  . 

=== India === . 

A number of players have started providing after-school support but still the number is very small. Considering the India's demographic profile and education as an important priority for the Indian Middle Class and others. More players should be out in the market to provide quality support which the normal schools doesn't provide with the skewed class size and traditional teaching techniques. From the existing set of After-school providers the ones with individualized learning modules, complimenting school (K-12) are the most sought after. [http://www.way2success.in Way2Success Learning Systems], India's first of its kind for-profit provider, runs and manage academically oriented individualized after-school programs complimenting school syllabus across New Delhi, Noida, Gurgaon and Faridabad areas.  .
