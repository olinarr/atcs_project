A '''year-round school''' is a school that runs for 10 months with a cumulative 2 months of break distributed throughout the year, without the usual multiple-month [[summer vacation]]. They are most often found in the [[United States]]. The longer period of schooling is compensated with more frequent one- and two-week breaks, in addition to the ones found in traditional schools; as a result, the school year in a year-round school usually has a similar number of instructional days as other schools.  . 

==Types of Year Round Education==. 
Three types of year round schooling exist: single track, multitrack, and extended year.  Most schools are on either a single track or multitrack system; the foremost difference between the two is that single track schedules allow all students to attend school at the same time, while multitrack systems divide students and teachers into various tracks with different instructional times and vacations. <ref name="Palmer">{{cite web|last=Palmer|first=Elisabeth A|title=Year-Round Education|url=http://www.cehd.umn.edu/carei/reports/docs/year-round.pdf|accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref>  Two of the most common schedule plans are the 60-20 and the 45-15, both of which can be used in either single or multitrack programs.  The 60-20 schedule keeps students in school for sixty days with three twenty-day vacations, and the 45-15 plan provides students with forty-five days of instruction and four fifteen-day vacations.  Variations on these schedules, such as 60-15 and 45-10, allow students one more break during the school year. <ref name="Palmer" /> . 

===Single Track===. 
The single track schedule is the most prominent of the three types. <ref name="Desshoff">{{cite journal|last=Desshoff|first=Alan|title="Is Year-Round Schooling on Track?"|journal=District Administration|year=2011|month=October|volume=47|issue=7|pages=34-36|accessdate=12 March 2012}}</ref> <ref name=Palmer>{{cite web}}</ref>   These schools do not add additional days to their school year, but instead they incorporate shorter breaks throughout the year. Thus, a single track schedule simply arranges the traditional school year into different school days and break days.  Critics often analyze both the academic and financial effects of this common form of year-round school, but according to Charles Ballinger, executive director emeritus of the National Association for Year-Round Education (NAYRE), a single track schedule “doesn’t cost any more or less [than a traditional school schedule]…it’s pretty much a wash financially."<ref name=Desshoff>{{cite journal}}</ref>  . 

===Multitrack===. 
A multitrack schedule divides students into multiple tracks so that one group goes to school while another group takes vacation. <ref name=Desshoff>{{cite journal}}</ref>   Multitrack schedules reportedly bring many benefits to schools that use them.  Some of these schools utilize multiple tracks to aid specific groups of students.  Some schools place all grades of bilingual or gifted and talented classes on the same track so that all of these students attend school at the same time.  Some of these schools utilize such a schedule for financial reasons: schools in Wake County, N.C., have four tracks in order to accommodate more students without having to build more schools.  This school system reports that for every three multitrack schools, one less school must be built. <ref name=Desshoff>{{cite journal}}</ref> . 

===Extended Year===. 
The extended year schedule can act as either a single track or multitrack, but it adds 15 to 20 days to the total school year.  President Obama has called for school administrations to lengthen school years in order to compete with students worldwide, and Education Secretary Arne Duncan supports extended school years as well. <ref name=Desshoff>{{cite journal}}</ref>   <small><span class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Dsakers|Dsakers]] ([[User talk:Dsakers|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dsakers|contribs]]) 01:35, 13 March 2012 (UTC)</span></small> . 

==Controversy==. 
Just as most things, the topic of year-round schooling has two sides.  Individuals and organizations argue both in favor of and against year-round education.  
===In Favor of Year-Round School===. 
====Effects on Students====. 
=====Attitudes=====. 
Several different studies have been conducted to learn more about the attitudes of students who attend year-round schools.   The majority of these studies show that students’ attitudes towards school did significantly increase as they spent more time on a year-round schedule<ref name="Alternative Calenders">{{cite journal|last=Palmer|coauthors=Bemis|title=Alternative Calendars: Extended Learning and Year-Round Programs,|journal=University of Minnesota, Center for Applied Research and Educational Improvement|year=1999|accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref>. Students who attend year-round school say that their calendar is more balanced than their peers who have a typical school calendar<ref name="Year Round School">{{cite web|title=Year Round School|url=http://www.k12academics.com/education-policy/year-round-school|publisher=K12 Academics|accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref> 
=====Academic Performance=====. 
Students who attend year-round schools typically do as well as or slightly better in school than their peers who attend a traditionally scheduled school<ref name="Alternative Calenders" /> .  . 

[[At-risk students]] are those who come from a low-income family, have a [[disability]], are of an [[ethnic minority]], or are influenced by something else that may cause them to perform poorly in school.    In 1994, a study of three year-round schools showed a substantial gain in academic achievement for at-risk, low performing students.  More frequent, short breaks provide struggling students more time for help<ref name=Ballinger>{{cite journal|last=Ballinger|first=C.|title=Prisoners No More|journal=Educational Leadership|year=1995|volume=53|issue=3}}</ref>.  These breaks can be used for remedial courses, tutoring, and enrichment, if needed<ref name="Year Round School">{{cite web|title=Year Round School|url=http://www.k12academics.com/education-policy/year-round-school|publisher=K12 Academics|accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref>.  . 

The state of California’s Department of Education claims that year-round schools’ third-graders had an average increase of 9.5% on standardized tests and 13.3% in reading scores<ref name="Year Round School">{{cite web|title=Year Round School|url=http://www.k12academics.com/education-policy/year-round-school|publisher=K12 Academics|accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref> .  . 

====Effect on Teachers and Administration====. 
Studies show that even though around 50% of parents are in favor of the year-round schedule before it is implemented, almost 80% are in favor of it after the first year<ref name="Alternative Calenders" />.  Parents and families are able to still arrange daycare as well as vacations.  The year round schedule provides more opportunities for family vacations.  This schedule can also save families money because they are able to take vacations during off-peak times<ref name="Year Round School">{{cite web|title=Year Round School|url=http://www.k12academics.com/education-policy/year-round-school|publisher=K12 Academics|accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref> .  . 

===Against Year Round Schooling===. 
====Costs==== . 

If schools are open for longer the operating and maintenance costs may increase up to 10 percent. <ref>{{cite web|last=Silva|first=Elena|title=On the Clock: Rethinking the Way Schools Use Time|url=http://www.educationsector.org/publications/clock-rethinking-way-schools-use-time|accessdate=27 March 2012}}</ref> These costs may add up and in turn interfere with budgets for other programs that are already struggling with funding such as the arts, sports and other extra-curricular activities that are state funded.   . 

With today's current economic state, students often have to save up their own money to be able to attend college. This means they often will seek summer or part time jobs to do so. Year round schooling may create difficulties for teens to be able to maintain part-time or summer job to save up their money. <ref name=Teacherscount.org>{{cite web|title=Year Round Schooling|url=http://www.teacherscount.org/issues/yearround/index.shtml}}</ref> . 

====Effects on Students==== . 

Students with attention learning disabilities may experience difficulties with longer school days.  Younger elementary students who are not psychologically fully developed may not see any additional benefit to extended days. This in turn may increase behavioral issues within the classroom. <ref name=Teacherscount.org>{{cite web|title=Year Round Schooling|url=http://www.teacherscount.org/issues/yearround/index.shtml}}</ref>  . 

Students that attend year round schooling may miss out on experiences such as summer camps. 
<ref>{{cite web|last=Bothwell|first=Dick|title=Can Year Round Schools Be the Answers to Overcrowding|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VUlSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=enoDAAAAIBAJ&dq=year-round-school&pg=1833%2C5419673|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=27 March 2012}}</ref> . 

After school activities may experience conflicts with longer school days. They may also experience budgeting issues with extended schooling sessions into the year. <ref name=Teacherscount.org>{{cite web|title=Year Round Schooling|url=http://www.teacherscount.org/issues/yearround/index.shtml}}</ref> .
