== Approval process and current status == . 

Because the proposed turbines are more than three miles (5 km) from shore, they are subject to federal jurisdiction.  However, near-shore infrastructure including roads and power cables make the project subject to state and local jurisdiction as well. <ref name="moves" />  All necessary state and local pre-construction approvals were obtained by 2009.  Major federal approvals were obtained May 17, 2010, with lease details, and construction and operation permits to be granted as the project proceeds.  . 

Cape Wind must now finance and build its project, and find customers for the electricity it will produce.  On May 7, 2010, Cape Wind announced a [[power purchase agreement]] (PPA) with [[National Grid (USA)|National Grid]] to sell half the project's output (i.e. about 750&nbsp;million kW·h/year) for an initial price of 20.7&nbsp;¢/kW·h (later agreed at 18.7¢<ref name="dotprice">Dotson, Sharryn.

===State and local history===. 
At the state and local level, according to the Boston Globe, Cape Wind needed approval from the [[Cape Cod Commission]]; "a Chapter 91 license from the Department of Environmental Protection; a water quality certification from the state DEP; access permits from the Massachusetts Highway Department for work along state highways; a license from the Executive Office of Transportation for a railway crossing; orders of conditions from the Yarmouth and Barnstable Conservation Commissions; and road opening permits from Yarmouth and Barnstable."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2007/11/cape_wind_appea.html | work=The Boston Globe | title=Cape Wind appeals ruling that blocked wind farm in Nantucket Sound | date=November 21, 2007}}</ref> . 

On May 11, 2005, the Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board (MEFSB) approved the application to build the wind farm.  Opponents appealed the decision and on December 18, 2006 the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld the decision. <ref>[http://www.capewind.org/news746.htm FAVORABLE CAPE WIND DECISION UPHELD BY SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT]</ref> . 

In March 2007, the project received approval from Ian Bowles, the Massachusetts Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs, as required by the Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act (MEPA). <ref name="moves"> {{cite news

On June 20, 2008, the Barnstable Superior Court dismissed four of five counts against the MEPA certificate that had been filed by opposition groups and the Town of Barnstable. The fifth count was not considered ripe for a ruling since the matter was still pending before a state agency. <ref>"Barnstable judge validates Cape Wind's MEPA Certificate", Nantucket Independent, 25 June 2008. </ref> . 

On May 22, 2009, the Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board<ref>[http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=eoeeasubtopic&L=3&L0=Home&L1=Energy%2C+Utilities+%26+Clean+Technologies&L2=Energy+Facilities+Siting+Board&sid=Eoeea ]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/164-69h.htm |title=General Laws: CHAPTER 164, Section 69H |publisher=Mass.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-24}}</ref> issued a "Super Permit" to Cape Wind, overriding the Cape Cod Commission and obviating the need for any further state and local approvals. <ref>[http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090522/NEWS/90522009 Key Wind Farm Permits Approved] retrieved 4 June 2009</ref> . 

On August 31, 2010, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled 4-2 that the state has the power to overrule community opposition and grant the Cape Wind project a suite of local permits it needs to start construction. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2010/08/hold_for_sjc_an.html?p1=News_links | work=The Boston Globe | first=Beth | last=Daley | title=SJC gives Cape Wind go-ahead to start construction | date=August 31, 2010}}</ref> .

===Federal history===. 
At the federal level, Cape Wind originally applied for a permit in 2001 under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 with the [[US Army Corps of Engineers]].  The Army Corps eventually presented a draft [[Environmental Impact Statement]] (EIS). In a public comment period, many Federal agencies, local governments, and community groups found the draft EIS to have deficiencies.  Due to passage of the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005|2005 Energy Bill]], the regulatory authority for off-shore energy projects has been transferred from the Army Corps to the [[Minerals Management Service]] (MMS) within the [[U.S. Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]].  Whereas Cape Wind had expected to obtain approval quickly from the Army Corps, this transfer of authority to the MMS delayed the project.  . 

The MMS issued a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) in January 2008, and a Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) in January 2009. <ref name=cwFEIS>[http://www.mms.gov/offshore/RenewableEnergy/CapeWind.htm MMS Cape Wind page] [http://www.boemre.gov/offshore/alternativeenergy/PDFs/FEIS/Cape%20Wind%20Energy%20Project%20FEIS.pdf report], ''[[Minerals Management Service]]'', January 2009. </ref> . 

On January 4, 2010, U.S. Interior Secretary [[Ken Salazar]] called a meeting of principal parties to resolve remaining issues after the National Park Service ruled that Nantucket Sound is eligible to be listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] because of its cultural and spiritual significance to two Native American tribes. “After several years of review, it is now time to move the Cape Wind proposal to a final decision point. That is why I am gathering the principal parties together next week to consider the findings of the Keeper and to discuss how we might find a common-sense agreement on actions that could be taken to minimize and mitigate Cape Wind’s potential impacts on historic and cultural resources.  I am hopeful that an agreement among the parties can be reached by March&nbsp;1. If an agreement among the parties can’t be reached, I will be prepared to take the steps necessary to bring the permit process to conclusion. The public, the parties, and the permit applicants deserve certainty and resolution.”<ref>[http://interior.gov/news/09_News_Releases/010410.html Secretary Salazar Initiates Final Review of Cape Wind Proposal]</ref> . 

On March 22, 2010, a hearing was held before the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. Proponents and opponents of the plan delivered testimony during the hearing. The Council was to deliver their recommendations to Interior Secretary Salazar no later than April&nbsp;14, 2010. <ref name="Capecodonlinefate">{{cite news |url= http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100427/NEWS11/100429794 |title=Fate of Cape Wind Decided |date=April 27, 2010 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=28 April 2010 |location=[[Washington D.C.]]}}</ref> . 

On April 28, 2010, at a news conference in the [[Massachusetts Statehouse]] alongside governor [[Deval Patrick]], a supporter of the project, Secretary Salazar announced "I am approving the Cape Wind project."

The [[FAA]] cleared the construction of the wind farm on May 17, 2010 after raising concerns that the windmills could cause interference with radar system at nearby [[Otis Air Force Base]]. Cape Wind agreed to fix the base's current system to ensure that it would not be affected by the wind farm. <ref> {{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/us/18brfs-FAACLEARSWIN_BRF.html?partner=rss&emc=rss | work=The New York Times | title=Massachusetts: F.A.A.

On October 6, 2010, Interior Secretary Salazar announced that a 28-year lease had been signed, which will cost Cape Wind an annual fee of $88,278 before construction, and a 2 to 7 percent variable operating fee during production, based on revenue from selling the energy. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doi.gov/news/pressreleases/Secretary-Salazar-Promotes-Clean-Energy-Signs-Cape-Wind-Lease-at-AWEA-Conference.cfm |title=Secretary Salazar Promotes Clean Energy, Signs Cape Wind Lease at AWEA Conference |publisher=Doi.gov |date=2010-10-06 |accessdate=2012-03-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/green/greenblog/2010/10/cape_wind_awarded_federal_leas.html | work=The Boston Globe | first=Beth | last=Daley | title=Cape Wind awarded federal lease | date=October 6, 2010}}</ref> .

On April 19, 2011, the Associated Press announced that the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement granted its necessary approval for the project.  . 

In Summer 2011, the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag Tribe]] of Gay Head (Aquinnah) filed a lawsuit against the federal government for allowing Cape Wind to move forward. <ref>{{cite news|last=Daley|first=Beth|title=Wampanoag tribe sues over Cape Wind|url=http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/green/greenblog/2011/07/wampanoag_tribe_sues_over_cape.html|publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref> Contradicting the Aquinnahs, the Pocasset Wampanoag Tribe had previously expressed support for the project. <ref>{{cite web|title=Head of Pocasset Wampanoag Tribe sends Salazar letter of support for Cape Wind|url=http://www.capecodtoday.com/blogs/index.php/2010/03/05/head-of-pocasset-wampanoag-tribe-sends-s?blog=53|publisher=Cape Cod Today|accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref> .

[[Walter Cronkite]] was the subject of controversy as well when he originally came out against the wind farm but then changed his opinion. <ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2003/08/29/cronkite_urges_full_review_of_wind_farm_proposal/ Cronkite urges full review of wind farm proposal]</ref>  Other opponents have included Sen. [[Ted Kennedy]],<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/06/26/sunday/main560595.shtml Storm Over Mass. Windmill Plan]</ref> Sen. [[John Kerry]], former Gov. [[Mitt Romney]], and businessman [[Bill Koch (businessman)|Bill Koch]],<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.forbes.com/2006/09/21/koch-gordon-nantucket-biz_cz_td_06rich400_0921nantucket.html |title= Koch's New Fight |date= September 21, 2006 |author= Doyle, Tim |work=Forbes}}</ref> who has donated $1.5 million to the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound.  . 

Proponents suggest that some of this opposition is motivated in part by ownership of real-estate on [[Nantucket]], [[Martha's Vineyard]] or the mainland and that it raises issues of [[environmental justice]]. [[Robert Kennedy, Jr.]], whose family's [[Kennedy Compound]] is within sight of the proposed wind farm, wrote an essay for the ''New York Times'' stating his support for wind power in general, but opposing this project. <ref> {{cite news

A recent book by Robert Whitcomb, Vice President and Editorial Page Editor of the ''[[Providence Journal]],'' and Wendy Williams argues that the fight over Cape Wind involves a powerful, privileged minority imposing their will on the majority. <ref name=autogenerated1> [http://www.renewableenergyaccess.com/rea/news/podcast?id=49667 The Saga Behind Cape Wind; Growing Opportunities in the Renewable Energy Sector]</ref> . 

===2006 election===. 
Cape Wind was an issue in the [[Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 2006|2006 election for Governor of Massachusetts]].  The winner, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Deval Patrick]], supported the project; his [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opponent, former Lieutenant Governor [[Kerry Healey]], opposed it. <ref> {{cite news

===Movies and TV===. 
In 2003 a documentary film entitled ''[[Wind Over Water]]'' about the controversy over the Cape Wind Project was released. The film by journalist Ole Tangen Jr. chronicled the debate as it unfolded on the Cape. An independent production, the filmmaker interviewed subjects from both sides of the debate including Jim Gordon, the driving force behind Cape Wind and Isaac Rosen, then director of the [[Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound]]. Focusing also on wind power in general, ''Wind Over Water'' features aerial footage of the offshore wind farm at [[Horns Rev]] in [[Denmark]] and footage from various [[wind farms]] in the U.S. On December&nbsp;6, 2003 the film made its world and [[Cape Cod]] premiere at the Lillie Auditorium in [[Woods Hole]].  . 

Satirical news correspondent [[Jason Jones (actor)|Jason Jones]] of ''[[The Daily Show]]'' has also covered the Cape Wind project. <ref> {{cite web

A feature length documentary about the Cape Wind project, entitled ''Cape Spin: An American Power Struggle'', had pre-release screenings in the summer of 2011. <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wgbh.org/wcai/cape_wind_blog.cfm |title= Sean Corcoran's Cape Wind Blog |author= Corcoran, Sean |publisher= WCAI: Cape and Islands NPR Station }}</ref> . 

===Books===. 
Wendy Williams and Robert Whitcomb have recently written a book about the project's history called ''Cape Wind: Money, Celebrity, Class, Politics and the Battle for Our Energy Future on Nantucket Sound.''<ref>{{cite book

In an interview, one of the authors states that the fight over Cape Wind is a case of a "a very small group of people, with more money than most of us can possibly imagine, who decided from the very beginning [...] that they didn't want it there, it would upset their Martini time."<ref name=autogenerated1 /> . 

===Public opinion survey results===. 
A 2007 [[Opinion Research Corporation]] (ORC) survey of 600 state residents found that 93% [[Massachusetts]] residents agree that the state should be "a national leader in using cleaner and [[renewable energy]] on a large scale by moving ahead with offshore wind power" and other clean energy initiatives. This statement is supported by 78&nbsp;percent of those who live on the Cape and on the Islands. <ref name="sur"> [http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/08-15-2007/0004646292&EDATE= Survey: Leadership on Cape Wind, Other Clean Energy Solutions to Global Warming Seen as Path to New 'Massachusetts Miracle']</ref> . 

The 2007 ORC survey also found that 84% of Massachusetts residents — including 58% of those who live on the Cape and on the Islands — explicitly support "the proposed Cape Wind offshore wind farm that would involve [[wind turbines]] being placed in Nantucket Sound about five and a half miles from the Town of Hyannis." (A June 2006 survey posed the same question and found 81% support statewide and 61% in Cape Cod/the Islands.)<ref name="sur" /> . 

In 2007, 78% of Massachusetts residents surveyed — including 61% of those living on the Cape and on the Islands — support wind as the best energy resource to provide electricity to Cape Cod and the Islands. Statewide, the support for other alternatives was as follows: nuclear&nbsp;(10%); coal&nbsp;(4%); and other&nbsp;(5%). <ref name="sur" /> . 

Clean renewable energy is widely supported over [[nuclear power]] in Massachusetts, including on the Cape and on the Islands. Massachusetts residents would prefer to see [[solar power]] (91%), more [[energy conservation]] (90%), and wind power (89%) used first before resorting to more nuclear power. On the Cape and on the Islands, the views were very similar, with strong support for wind power (75%); conservation&nbsp;(81%); and solar&nbsp;(84%). <ref name="sur" /> . 

2007 survey results were based on telephone interviews conducted among a sample of 600 householders aged&nbsp;18 and over. Interviewing was completed by Opinion Research Corporation, for the Newton-based [[Civil Society Institute]],<ref name="sur"> http://www.civilsocietyinsitute.com</ref> during July and August 2007. <ref name="sur" /> . 

During the November 4, 2008 election, 87% of voters in eleven Massachusetts towns on the south shore, near but not on the Cape, voted yes on Question&nbsp;4, a non-binding question that read: . 

:"Should the state representative from this district be instructed to vote in favor of legislation that would support the development of Cape Wind in Nantucket Sound and other possible future onshore and offshore wind power developments in Massachusetts?" . 

The measure was voted on by the towns of [[Braintree, Massachusetts|Braintree]], [[Holbrook, Massachusetts|Holbrook]], [[Randolph, Massachusetts|Randolph]], [[Cohasset, Massachusetts|Cohasset]], [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]], [[Hull, Massachusetts|Hull]], [[Marshfield, Massachusetts|Marshfield]], [[Scituate, Massachusetts|Scituate]], [[Hanover, Massachusetts|Hanover]], [[Norwell, Massachusetts|Norwell]], and [[Rockland, Massachusetts|Rockland]]. <ref> {{cite web

A 2009 poll by the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce showed 55% of its members oppose the project and 41% supported it. <ref>[http://www.saveoursound.org/site/News2?news_iv_ctrl=-1&amp;page=NewsArticle&amp;id=6757 Cape Cod Chamber Poll Finds 55% Opposed to Controversial Cape Wind Project]</ref> . 

A 2010 poll by the Boston Globe said 69% of respondents supported Cape Wind, to 20% opposed.  Further questions about cost showed that half of respondents said they would not support paying higher prices for the project's electricity.  In general, however, many respondents said they would be in favor of paying higher rates if it meant getting electricity from cleaner sources.  Forty-two percent said they would be willing to pay more, while 7 percent were unsure. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/articles/2010/09/27/in_poll_edge_goes_to_sales_tax_cut/ | work=The Boston Globe | first=Alan | last=Wirzbicki | title=In poll, edge goes to sales tax cut | date=September 27, 2010}}</ref> . 

===Cost===. 
In 2010, the Massachusetts Attorney General's office estimates that Cape Wind will ultimately cost $2.5 billion.  Costs of the electricity generated by the project are estimated to be double the 2010 price of traditional [[Fossil fuel|fossil fuels]]. <ref name="daley1"/> . 

==Other Cape Cod wind projects==. 
According to a report in the ''Boston Globe'', May 24, 2006, Jay M. Cashman, owner of a large construction company that built part of the [[Big Dig (Boston, Massachusetts)|Big Dig]], proposed to build a $750&nbsp;million wind farm in [[Buzzards Bay]], about {{convert|20|mi|km}} west of the proposed Cape Wind site. The Cashman farm would be closer (2&nbsp;mi) to shore and would consist of 120&nbsp;turbines, each {{convert|450|ft|m}} tall. The projected generation capacity is 300&nbsp;MW. According to the ''Globe'', some opponents of the Cape Wind project have expressed interest in the Cashman plan. <ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2006/05/24/buzzards_bay_wind_farm_proposed/?page=full Buzzards Bay Wind Farm Proposed]</ref> In February, 2008, state law was amended removing a prohibition on the construction of electrical generating facilities within ocean sanctuaries. <ref>[http://www.buzzardsbay.org/windfarms.htm Proposed Wind Farms in Buzzards Bay]</ref> .
