Compared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources, the '''environmental impact of wind power''' is relatively minor. [[Wind power]] consumes no fuel, and emits no [[air pollution]], unlike fossil fuel power sources. The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months. While a wind farm may cover a large area of land, many land uses such as agriculture are compatible, with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use. <ref name=mar>[http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/WindPowersStrength.pdf  Why Australia needs wind power]</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.bwea.com/ref/faq.html | title=Wind energy Frequently Asked Questions| publisher=British Wind Energy Association| accessdate=2006-04-21}}</ref>  .

Wind turbines produce no [[carbon dioxide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitrogen dioxide]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[radioactive waste]], [[particulate]]s, or any other type of [[air pollution]], unlike fossil fuel power sources. Wind power plants consume resources in manufacturing and construction. During manufacture of the wind turbine, [[steel]], [[concrete]], [[aluminium]] and other materials will have to be made and transported using energy-intensive processes, generally using fossil energy sources. The wind turbine manufacturer Vestas states that initial carbon dioxide emissions "pay back" is within about 9 months of operation for off shore turbines. <ref name="vestas"> .

== Net energy gain == . 

The initial carbon dioxide emission from energy used in the installation is "paid back" within about 9 months of operation for off shore turbines. Any practical large-scale energy source must replace the energy used in its construction. The [[EROEI|energy return on investment]] (EROI) for wind energy is equal to the cumulative electricity generated divided by the cumulative primary energy required to build and maintain a turbine. The EROI for wind ranges from 5 to 35, with an average of around 18, according to wind-energy advocates. EROI is strongly proportional to turbine size,<ref>{{cite web

Wind farms are often built on land that has already been impacted by land clearing. The vegetation clearing and ground disturbance required for wind farms is minimal compared with coal mines and coal-fired power stations. If wind farms are decommissioned, the landscape can be returned to its previous condition. <ref name="nsw2010">New South Wales Government (1 November 2010).

Farmers and graziers often lease land to companies building wind farms. In the U.S., farmers may receive annual lease payments of two thousand to five thousand dollars per turbine,<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04756.pdf | format=PDF| accessdate=2006-04-21| publisher=United States Government Accountability Office| month=September | year=2004| title=RENEWABLE ENERGY — Wind Power’s Contribution to Electric Power Generation and Impact on Farms and Rural Communities (GAO-04-756)}}</ref> and wind farms may also provide additional community payments "...to reward residents who have made no financial gains [directly] from wind energy development, but whose views of...

The land can still be used for farming and cattle grazing. Livestock are unaffected by the presence of wind farms. International experience shows that livestock will "graze right up to the base of wind turbines and often use them as rubbing posts or for shade". <ref name="nsw2010"/> . 

Wind-energy advocates contend that less than 1% of the land would be used for foundations and access roads, the other 99% could still be used for farming. <ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.bwea.com/ref/faq.html | title=Wind energy Frequently Asked Questions| publisher=British Wind Energy Association| accessdate=2006-04-21}}</ref> Critics point out that the clearing of trees around tower bases may be necessary for installation sites on mountain ridges, such as in the northeastern U.S. <ref>[http://www.wind-watch.org/pix/displayimage.php?pid=26&fullsize=1 Forest clearance for Meyersdale, Pa., wind power facility]</ref> . 

Turbines are not generally installed in urban areas. Buildings interfere with wind, turbines must be sited a safe distance ("setback") from residences in case of failure, and the value of land is high. There are [[Unconventional wind turbines#Wind turbines on public display|a few notable exceptions]] to this. [[Toronto Hydro]] has built a lake shore demonstration project, and [[Steel Winds]] is a 20 MW urban project south of [[Buffalo, New York]]. Both of these projects are in urban locations, but benefit from being on uninhabited lake shore property.  .

Offshore locations use no land and avoid shipping channels.  . 

=== Impact on wildlife === . 

Environmental assessments are routinely carried out for wind farm proposals, and potential impacts on the local environment (e.g. plants, animals, soils) are evaluated. <ref name=nsw2010/> Turbine locations and operations are often modified as part of the approval process to avoid or minimise impacts on threatened species and their habitats. Any unavoidable impacts can be offset with conservation improvements of similar ecosystems which are unaffected by the proposal. <ref name="nsw2010"/> . 

Projects such as the [[Black Law Wind Farm]] have received wide recognition for its contribution to environmental objectives, including praise from the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]], who describe the scheme as both improving the landscape of a derelict opencast mining site and also benefiting a range of wildlife in the area, with an extensive habitat management projects covering over 14 square kilometres. <ref name=bwea>[http://www.bwea.com/media/news/060213_bl.html UK's most powerful wind farm could power Paisley]</ref> . 

A research agenda from a coalition of researchers from universities, industry, and government, supported by the [[Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future]], suggests modeling the spatiotemporal patterns of migratory and residential wildlife with respect to geographic features and weather, to provide a basis for science-based decisions about where to site new wind projects. More specifically, it suggests:
*Use existing data on migratory and other movements of wildlife to develop predictive models of risk. 
*Use new and emerging technologies, including radar, acoustics, and thermal imaging, to fill gaps in knowledge of wildlife movements. 
*Identify specific species or sets of species most at risk in areas of high potential wind resoures. <ref>{{cite web|last=Zehnder and Warhaft|first=Alan and Zellman|title=University Collaboration on Wind Energy|url=http://www.sustainablefuture.cornell.edu/attachments/2011-UnivWindCollaboration.pdf|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref> .

</ref> This study suggests some onshore and near-shore sites may be particularly hazardous to local bat populations and more research is needed. Migratory bat species appear to be particularly at risk, especially during key movement periods (spring and more importantly in fall). Lasiurines such as the [[hoary bat]], [[Eastern Red Bat|red bat]], and the [[silver-haired bat]] appear to be most vulnerable at North American sites. Almost nothing is known about current populations of these species and the impact on bat numbers as a result of mortality at windpower locations.

=== Climate change ===. 
Wind farms may affect weather in their immediate vicinity. Spinning wind turbine rotors generate a lot of turbulence in their wakes like the wake of a boat. This turbulence increases vertical mixing of heat and water vapor that affects the meteorological conditions downwind. Overall, wind farms lead to a warming at night and cooling during the day time. This effect can be reduced by using more efficient rotors or placing wind farms in regions with high natural turbulence. Warming at night could "benefit agriculture by decreasing frost damage and extending the growing season. Many farmers already do this with air circulators". <ref>[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v468/n7327/full/4681001a.html Turbines and turbulence]</ref><ref>[http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/10/12/1000493107.abstract Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences: Impacts of wind farms on surface air temperatures]</ref><ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2005/1012-wind_farms_impacting_weather.htm Wind farms impacting weather - Science Daily]</ref> . 

A number of studies have used climate models to study the effect of extremely large wind farms. One study reports simulations that show detectable changes in global climate for very high wind farm usage, on the order of 10% of the world's land area. Wind power has a negligible effect on global mean surface temperature, and it would deliver "enormous global benefits by reducing emissions of CO2 and air pollutants". <ref>[http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/101/46/16115 The influence of large-scale wind power on global climate — PNAS<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Another study published in ''Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics'' suggested that using wind turbines to meet 10 percent of global energy demand in 2100 could actually have a warming effect, causing temperatures to rise by {{convert|1|C-change}} in the regions on land where the wind farms are installed, including a smaller increase in areas beyond those regions. This is due to the effect of wind turbines on both horizontal and vertical atmospheric circulation. Whilst turbines installed in water would have a cooling effect, the net impact on global surface temperatures would be an increase of {{convert|0.15|C-change}}. Author Ron Prinn cautioned against interpreting the study "as an argument against wind power, urging that it be used to guide future research".  "We’re not pessimistic about wind," he said. "We haven’t absolutely proven this effect, and we’d rather see that people do further research". <ref>http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/climate-wind-0312.html MIT analysis suggests generating electricity from large-scale wind farms could influence climate — and not necessarily in the desired way. </ref> .

=== Safety === . 

Operation of any utility-scale energy conversion system presents safety hazards. Wind turbines do not consume fuel or produce pollution during normal operation, but still have hazards associated with their construction, operation and maintenance.  . 

With the installation of industrial sized wind turbines numbering in the thousands, there have been at least 40 fatalities of workers due to the construction, operation, and maintenance of wind turbines, and other injuries and deaths attributed to the wind power life cycle. <ref name="Caithness"> .

If a turbine's brake fails, the turbine can spin freely until it disintegrates or catches fire. Some turbine gondola fires cannot be extinguished because of their height, and are sometimes left to burn themselves out. In such cases they generate toxic fumes and can cause secondary fires below. Several turbine-ignited fires have burned hundreds of acres of vegetation each. <ref name="Caithness" /><ref> .

Modern turbines can detect ice formation and excess vibration during operations, and are shut down automatically. Electronic controllers and safety sub-systems monitor many different aspects of the turbine, generator, tower, and environment to determine if the turbine is operating in a safe manner within prescribed limits.  These systems can temporarily shut down the turbine due to high wind, ice, electrical load imbalance, vibration, and other problems.  Recurring or significant problems cause a system lockout and notify an engineer for inspection and repair.  In addition, most systems include multiple passive safety systems that stop operation even if the electronic controller fails.  .

=== Aesthetics === . 

Newer wind farms have larger, more widely spaced turbines, and have a less cluttered appearance than older installations. Wind farms are often built on land that has already been impacted by land clearing and they coexist easily with other land uses (e.g. grazing, crops). They have a smaller footprint than other forms of energy generation such as coal and gas plants. <ref name="The wind energy fact sheet">New South Wales Government (1 November 2010). [http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/climatechange/10923windfacts.pdf The wind energy fact sheet] Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water, p. 12. </ref> Wind farms may be close to scenic or otherwise undeveloped areas, and aesthetic issues are important for onshore and near-shore locations.  .

In a 2009 report about "Rural Wind Farms", a Standing Committee of the Parliament of New South Wales, Australia, recommended a minimum setback of two kilometres between wind turbines and neighbouring houses (which can be waived by the affected neighbour) as a precautionary approach. <ref name="NSW1"> .

A 2008 guest editorial in ''[[Environmental Health Perspectives]]'' published by the [[National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences]], the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]], stated: "Even seemingly clean sources of energy can have implications on human health. Wind energy will undoubtedly create noise, which increases stress, which in turn increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer."<ref> .

The Japanese Environment Ministry will begin a "major study into the influence of sounds of wind turbines on people's health" in April 2010, because "people living near wind power facilities are increasingly complaining of health problems". They plan a four-year examination of all 1,517 wind turbines in the country. <ref name=Yomiuri1> .

A 2007 report by the U.S. National Research Council noted that noise produced by wind turbines is generally not a major concern for humans beyond a half-mile or so.  Low-frequency vibration and its effects on humans are not well understood and sensitivity to such vibration resulting from wind-turbine noise is highly variable among humans. There are opposing views on this subject, and more research needs to be done on the effects of low-frequency noise on humans. <ref name='NRC1'> .

Research by Stefan Oerlemans for the [[University of Twente]] and the Dutch [[National Aerospace Laboratory]] suggests that noise from existing wind turbines may be reducible by up to half by adding "saw teeth" to the trailing edges of the blades, although research is not complete. <ref> .

==== 2009 review ==== . 

A 2009 expert panel review, described as being the most comprehensive to date, delved into the possible adverse health effects of those living close to wind turbines.  Their report findings concluded that [[wind turbine]]s do not directly make people ill. <ref name="TorStar" /><ref name='CanWEA09'> . 

W. David Colby, Robert Dobie, Geoff Leventhall, David M. Lipscomb, Robert J. McCunney, Michael T. Seilo, Bo Søndergaard. [http://www.canwea.ca/pdf/talkwind/Wind_Turbine_Sound_and_Health_Effects.pdf "Wind Turbine Sound and Health Effects: An Expert Panel Review"], Canadian Wind Energy Association, December 2009. </ref> . 

The 85-page study was sponsored by the [[Canadian Wind Energy Association]] and [[American Wind Energy Association]].  The academic and medical experts who conducted the study stated that they reached their conclusions independent of their sponsors.  "We were not told to find anything," said panel expert David Colby, a public health officer in [[Chatham-Kent]] and a Professor of Medicine at the [[University of Western Ontario]]. "It was completely open ended."<ref name="TorStar" /> . 

The study did allow that some people could experience stress or irritation caused by the swishing sounds wind turbines produce. "A small minority of those exposed report annoyance and stress associated with [[Psychoacoustics|noise perception]]..." [however] "Annoyance is not a disease."  The study group pointed out that similar irritations are produced by [[roadway noise|local and highway vehicles]], as well as from [[Industrial noise|industrial operations]] and [[Aircraft noise|aircraft]]. <ref name="TorStar" /> . 

The report found, amongst other things, that:<ref name="TorStar" />
*'' "Wind Turbine Syndrome" ''symptoms are the same as those seen in the general population due to stresses of daily life. They include [[headache]]s, [[insomnia]], [[anxiety]], [[dizziness]], etc... <ref name="TorStar" />
* [[low frequency]] and very low-frequency "[[infrasound]]" produced by wind turbines are the same as those produced by [[Roadway noise|vehicular traffic]] and [[home appliance]]s, even by the beating of people's hearts.  Such 'infrasounds' are not special and convey no risk factors;<ref name="TorStar" />
* Colby stated that evidence of harm was so minuscule that the wind associations were unable to initiate other independent collinear studies by government agencies.  It was not surprising that their requests met with complete blanks on the need to examine the issues further;<ref name="TorStar" />
* one study member noted: "You can't control the amount of cars going by and wind turbine noise is generally quieter than highway noise";<ref name="TorStar" />
* the power of suggestion, as conveyed by [[news media]] coverage of perceived 'wind-turbine sickness', might have triggered "anticipatory [[fear]]" in those close to turbine installations. <ref name="TorStar" /> . 

The study panel members included: Robert Dobie, a doctor and clinical professor at the [[University of Texas]], Geoff Leventhall, a [[Noise, vibration, and harshness|noise vibration]] and [[acoustics]] expert in the United Kingdom, Bo Sondergaard, with Danish Electronics Light and Acoustics, Michael Seilo, a professor of [[audiology]] at [[Western Washington University]], and Robert McCunney, a [[biological engineering]] scientist at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. McCunney contested statements that infrasounds from wind turbines could create [[vibration]]s causing ill health: "It doesn't really have much credence, at least based on the literature out there" he stated. <ref name="TorStar" /> . 

==== 2011 review ==== . 

In 2011, the ''British Acoustics Bulletin'' published what is now the 10th independent review of the evidence on wind farms causing annoyance and ill health in people. And for the 10th time it has emphasised that "annoyance has far more to do with social and psychological factors in those complaining than any direct effect from sound or inaudible infrasound emanating from wind turbines". <ref name=smh11/> . 

Two factors repeatedly came up. "The first is being able to see wind turbines, which increases annoyance particularly in those who dislike or fear them. The second factor is whether people derive income from hosting turbines, which miraculously appears to be a highly effective antidote to feelings of annoyance and symptoms". <ref name=smh11> .

== Offshore ==. 
Many [[List of offshore wind farms|offshore wind farms]] are being built in UK waters.  In January 2009, a comprehensive government environmental study of coastal waters in the United Kingdom concluded that there is scope for between 5,000 and 7,000 [[offshore wind]] turbines to be installed without an adverse impact on the marine environment. The study – which forms part of the Department of Energy and Climate Change's Offshore Energy Strategic Environmental Assessment – is based on more than a year's research.  It included analysis of seabed geology, as well as surveys of sea birds and marine mammals. <ref>[http://www.businessgreen.com/business-green/news/2235062/study-finds-offshore-wind-farms Study finds offshore wind farms can co-exist with marine environment]</ref><ref>[http://www.offshore-sea.org.uk/consultations/Offshore_Energy_SEA/OES_Non_Technical_Summary.pdf UK Offshore Energy Strategic Environmental Assessment]</ref> .
