'''Offshore wind power''' refers to the construction of [[Wind Farm|wind farms]] in bodies of water to generate [[Wind power|electricity from wind]]. Better wind speeds are available offshore compared to on land, so offshore wind power’s contribution in terms of electricity supplied is higher. <ref name=btm2010o/> However, offshore wind farms are relatively expensive. <ref name=eia2010dec16/> . 

[[Siemens]], [[REpower]], and [[Vestas]] are the leading turbine suppliers for offshore wind power. [[Dong Energy]], [[Vattenfall]] and [[E.on]] are the leading offshore operators. <ref name=btm2010o/> As of October 2010,  3.16 GW of offshore wind power capacity was operational, mainly in Northern Europe. According to [[BTM Consult]], more than 16 GW of additional capacity will be installed before the end of 2014 and the United Kingdom and Germany will become the two leading markets. Offshore wind power capacity is expected to reach a total of 75 GW worldwide by 2020, with significant contributions from China and the United States. <ref name=btm2010o/> . 

As of February 2012, the [[Walney Wind Farm]] in [[United Kingdom]] is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 367 [[Megawatt|MW]], followed by [[Thanet Offshore Wind Project]] (300 MW), also in the UK. The [[London Array]] (630 MW) is the largest project under construction. These projects will be dwarfed by subsequent wind farms that are in the pipeline, including [[Dogger_Bank#Wind_farm|Dogger Bank]] at 9,000 MW, Norfolk Bank (7,200 MW), and Irish Sea (4,200 MW).  . 

==Definition==. 
Offshore wind power refers to the construction of [[Wind Farm|wind farms]] in bodies of water to generate [[Wind power|electricity from wind]]. Unlike the term typical usage of the term "offshore" in the marine industry, offshore wind power includes inshore water areas such as lakes, fjords and sheltered coastal areas, utilizing [[Wind_farm#Offshore|traditional fixed-bottom wind turbine technologies]], as well as deep-water areas utilizing [[floating wind turbine]]s.  . 

==History==. 
Europe is the world leader in offshore wind power, with the first offshore wind farm being installed in Denmark in 1991. <ref name=eesi2010/> In 2008, offshore wind power contributed 0.8 [[gigawatt]] (GW) of the total 28 GW of wind power capacity constructed that year. <ref>http://www.bwea.com/pdf/publications/CapReport.pdf</ref>
By October 2009, 26 offshore wind farms had been constructed in Europe with an average rated capacity of 76 MW,<ref>''Offshore Wind Energy'', The Windenergie-Agentur Bremerhaven/Bremen, 2009 Issue. </ref> and as of 2010 the [[United Kingdom]] has by far the largest capacity of offshore wind farms with 1.3 GW, more than the rest of the world combined at 1.1 GW<ref name="nef">[http://newenergyfocus.com/do/ecco/view_item?listid=1&listcatid=32&listitemid=4397&section=Wind UK reaches 5GW of installed wind landmark] ''New Energy Focus / [[BWEA]]'',  23 September 2010. Retrieved: 8 November 2010. </ref> The UK is followed by Denmark (854 MW), The Netherlands (249 MW), Belgium (195 MW), Sweden (164 MW), Germany (92 MW), Ireland (25 MW), Finland (26 MW) and Norway with 2.3 MW. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/01/offshore-wind-booming-in-europe??cmpid=WNL-Friday-January21-2011 |title=Offshore Wind Booming in Europe |date=January 20, 2011 |work=Renewable Energy World }}</ref> . 

As of October 2010, [[Denmark|Danish]] wind turbine manufacturers [[Siemens Wind Power]] and [[Vestas]] have installed 91.8% of the world's 3.16 GW offshore wind power capacity, although [[REpower]] is now starting to become a major player. Based on current orders, [[BTM Consult|BTM]] expects 15 GW more between 2010 and 2014. <ref name="btm2010op">Madsen & Krogsgaard.

As of February 2012, [[Walney Wind Farm]] in the [[United Kingdom]] is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 367 [[Megawatt|MW]], followed by [[Thanet Offshore Wind Project|Thanet]] (300 MW), also in the United Kingdom.  . 

There are many large offshore wind farms under construction and these include [[Anholt Offshore Wind Farm]] (400 MW), [[BARD Offshore 1]] (400 MW), [[Greater Gabbard wind farm]] (500 MW), [[Lincs Wind Farm]] (270 MW), [[London Array]] (1000 MW), [[Sheringham Shoal Offshore Wind Farm|Sheringham Shoal]] (317 MW), and the [[Walney Wind Farm]] (367 MW).  . 

Offshore wind farms worth some €8.5 billion ($11.4 billion) were under construction in European waters in 2011.

As of 2012, there are no offshore wind farms in the United States. However, projects are under development in wind-rich areas of the East Coast, Great Lakes, and Pacific coast. In January 2012, a "Smart for the Start" regulatory approach was introduced, designed to expedite the siting process while incorporating strong environmental protections. Specifically, the Department of Interior approved “wind energy areas” off the coast where projects can move through the regulatory approval process more quickly. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2012/02/offshore-wind-one-step-closer-to-reality-in-the-mid-atlantic?cmpid=WNL-Friday-February3-2012 |title=Offshore Wind One Step Closer to Reality in the Mid-Atlantic |author=Kit Kennedy |date=2 February 2012 |work=Renewable Energy World }}</ref> . 

==Economics and benefits==. 
Offshore wind power can help to reduce energy imports, reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases (by displacing fossil-fuel power generation), meet renewable electricity standards, and create jobs and local business opportunities. <ref name=eesi2010/> However, according to the US Energy Information Agency, offshore wind power is the most expensive energy generating technology being considered for large scale deployment". <ref name=eia2010dec16>[http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/electricity_generation.html Levelized Cost of New Generation Resources in the Annual Energy Outlook 2011]. Released December 16, 2010. Report of the  [[US Energy Information Administration]] (EIA) of the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE). </ref>. The advantage is that the wind is much stronger off the coasts, and unlike wind over the continent, offshore breezes can be strong in the afternoon, matching the time when people are using the most electricity. Offshore turbines can also be "located close to the power-hungry populations along the coasts, eliminating the need for new overland transmission lines". <ref>{{cite web |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/energy-environment/wind-power/index.html |title=Wind Power |author= |date=January 27, 2002 |work=New York Times }}</ref>  . 

Most entities and individuals active in offshore wind power believe that prices of electricity will grow significantly from 2009, as global efforts to reduce [[carbon emissions]] come into effect. [[BTM Consult|BTM]] expects cost per kWh to fall from 2014,<ref name="btm2010op"/> and that the resource will always be more than adequate in the three areas [[Europe]], [[United States]] and [[China]]. <ref name="btm2010o">Madsen & Krogsgaard. [http://btm.dk/news/offshore+wind+power+2010/?s=9&p=&n=39 Offshore Wind Power 2010] ''[[BTM Consult]]'', 22 November 2010. Retrieved: 22 November 2010. </ref> . 

The current state of offshore wind power presents economic challenges significantly greater than onshore systems - prices can be in the range of 2.5-3.0 million Euro/MW.  The turbine represents just one third to one half<ref name="owt-in">Lindvig, Kaj. [http://www.eufores.org/fileadmin/eufores/Events/Parliamentary_Events/Offshore_September_2010/The%20installation%20and%20servicing_A2SEA.pdf The installation and servicing of offshore wind farms] p6 ''[[A2SEA]]'', 16 September 2010. Accessed: 9 October 2011. </ref> of costs in offshore projects today, the rest comes from infrastructure, maintenance, and oversight. Larger turbines with increased energy capture make more economic sense due to the extra infrastructure in offshore systems. Additionally, there are currently no rigorous simulation models of external effects on offshore wind farms, such as boundary layer stability effects and wake effects. This causes difficulties in predicting performance accurately, a critical shortcoming in financing billion-dollar offshore facilities. A report from a coalition of researchers from universities, industry, and government, lays out several things needed in order to bring the costs down and make offshore wind more economically viable: . 

*Improving wind performance models, including how design conditions and the wind resource are influenced by the presence of other wind farms. 
*Reducing the weight of turbine materials
*Eliminating problematic gearboxes
*Turbine load-mitigation controls and strategies
*Turbine and rotor designs to minimize hurricane and typhoon damage
*Economic modeling and optimization of costs of the overall wind farm system, including installation, operations, and maintenance
*Service methodologies, remote monitoring, and diagnostics. <ref>{{cite web|last=Zehnder and Warhaft|first=Alan and Zellman|title=University Collaboration on Wind Energy|url=http://www.sustainablefuture.cornell.edu/attachments/2011-UnivWindCollaboration.pdf|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref> . 

In 2011, a [[DONG Energy|Danish energy company]] claimed that offshore wind turbines are not yet competitive with fossil fuels, but estimates that they will be in 15 years. Until then, state funding and pension funds will be needed. <ref name=econ15y>Nymark, Jens.

Accessed: 10 December 2011. </ref> . 

In Belfast, the harbour industry is being redeveloped as a hub for offshore windfarm construction, at a cost of about £50m. The work will create 150 jobs in construction, as well as requiring about 1m tonnes of stone from local quarries, which will create hundreds more jobs. "It is the first dedicated harbour upgrade for offshore wind". <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/feb/06/offshore-wind-turbine-british-industry?newsfeed=true |title=Offshore wind turbines set to benefit British industries |author=Fiona Harvey |date=6 February 2012  |work=[[The Guardian]] }}</ref> . 

==Technical details==. 
In 2009, the average nameplate capacity of an offshore wind turbine in Europe was about 3 MW, and the capacity of future turbines is expected to increase to 5 MW. <ref name=eesi2010/>   . 

Offshore turbines require different types of bases for stability, according to the depth of water. To date a number of different solutions exist: 
*A monopile (single column) base, six meters in diameter, is used in waters up to 30 meters deep. 
*Gravity Base Structures, for use at exposed sites in water 20- 80 m deep. 
*Tripod piled structures, in water 20-80 metres deep. 
*Tripod suction caisson structures, in water 20-80m deep. 
*Conventional steel jacket structures, as used in the oil and gas industry, in water 20-80m deep. 
*[[Floating wind turbine]]s are being developed for deeper water. <ref name=eesi2010/><ref>{{Cite web|title= Support structure concepts for offshore wind turbines
|publisher= LORC Knowledge|date = 2011-03-14| url = http://www.lorc.dk/Knowledge/Wind/Support-structures| accessdate = 2011-06-01}}</ref> . 

Turbines are much less accessible when offshore (requiring the use of a service vessel for routine access, and a [[jackup rig]] for heavy service such as gearbox replacement), and thus [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] is more important than for an onshore turbine. <ref name="btm2010o"/> A maintenance organization performs maintenance and repairs of the components, spending almost all its resources on the turbines.  Access to turbines is by helicopter or service access vessel. Some wind farms located far from possible onshore bases have service teams living on site in offshore accommodation units. <ref name="dong">[http://www.dongenergy.com/hornsrev2/en/about_horns_rev_2/about_the_project/pages/accomodation_platform.aspx Accommodation Platform] ''[[DONG Energy]]'', February 2010. Retrieved: 22 November 2010. </ref> . 

Because of their remote nature, prognosis and health-monitoring systems on offshore wind turbines will be come much more necessary. They would enable better planning just-in-time maintenance, thereby reducing the operations and maintenance costs. According to a report from a coalition of researchers from universities, industry, and government, supported by the [[Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future]], <ref>{{cite web|last=Zehnder and Warhaft|first=Alan and Zellman|title=University Collaboration on Wind Energy|url=http://www.sustainablefuture.cornell.edu/attachments/2011-UnivWindCollaboration.pdf|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref>making field data from these turbines available would be invaluable in validating complex analysis codes used for turbine design. Reducing this barrier would contribute to the education of engineers specializing in wind energy.   . 

The planning and permitting phase can cost  more than $10 million, take 5–7 years and have an uncertain outcome.  The industry puts pressure on the governments to improve the processes. <ref>http://www.newjerseynewsroom.com/commentary/nj-must-make-wind-farm-permitting-process-as-quick-and-easy-as-possible</ref><ref>http://www.ieawind.org/Annex%20XXIII/Subtask1.html</ref> In [[Denmark]], many of these phases have been deliberately streamlined by authorities in order to minimize hurdles. <ref name="emDK">[http://www.energymatters.com.au/index.php?main_page=news_article&article_id=992 Streamline Renewable Energy Policy and make Australia a World Leader] ''Energy Matters'', 11 August 2010. Retrieved: 6 November 2010. </ref> . 

Some of the guidelines for designing offshore wind farms are [[IEC 61400]]-3. <ref>[http://www.iec.ch/cgi-bin/procgi.pl/www/iecwww.p?wwwlang=e&wwwprog=pro-det.p&progdb=db1&He=IEC&Pu=61400&Pa=3&Se=&Am=&Fr=&TR=&Ed=1.0 International Standard IEC 61400-3] ''[[International Electrotechnical Commission]]'', August 2005.

Accessed: 12 March 2011. </ref> . 

===Design Environment===. 
Offshore wind resource characteristics span a range of spatial and temporal scales and field data on external conditions. Necessary data includes water depth, currents, seabed, migration, and wave action, all of which drive mechanical and structural loading on potential turbine configurations. Other factors include marine growth, salinity, icing, and the geotechnical characteristics of the sea or lake bed.  A number of things are necessary in order to attain the necessary information on these subjects. Existing hardware fore these measurements includes Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), Sonic Detection and Ranging (SODAR), radar, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), and remote satellite sensing, although these technologies should be assessed and refined, according to a report from a coalition of researchers from universities, industry, and government, supported by the [[Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future]]. <ref>{{cite web|last=Zehnder and Warhaft|first=Alan and Zellman|title=University Collaboration on Wind Energy|url=http://www.sustainablefuture.cornell.edu/attachments/2011-UnivWindCollaboration.pdf|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref> . 

Because of the previous factors, one of the biggest difficulties with offshore wind farms is the ability to predict loads. Analysis must account for the dynamic coupling between translational (surge, sway, and heave) and rotational (roll, pitch, and yaw) platform motions and turbine motions, as well as the dynamic characterization of mooring lines for floating systems. Foundations and substructures make up a large fraction of offshore wind systems, and must take into account every single one of these factors. <ref>{{cite web|last=Zehnder and Warhaft|first=Alan and Zellman|title=University Collaboration on Wind Energy|url=http://www.sustainablefuture.cornell.edu/attachments/2011-UnivWindCollaboration.pdf|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref> . 

==Aesthetics==.

{{main|Environmental effects of wind power#Aesthetics}}
Offshore wind turbines are less obtrusive than turbines on land, as their apparent size and noise is mitigated by distance. A 2006 Survey by the University of Delaware near the proposed [[Cape Wind]] development found that residents most frequently based their decisions to support or oppose the wind farm on perceived impacts to marine life, the environment, electricity rates, aesthetics, fishing and boating. <ref>http://www.eesi.org/files/offshore_wind_101310.pdf</ref> .
