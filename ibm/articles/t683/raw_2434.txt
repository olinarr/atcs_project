A '''wind farm''' is a group of [[wind turbine]]s in the same location used to produce electric power. A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines, and cover an extended area of hundreds of square miles, but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes. A wind farm may also be located offshore.  . 

Many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in the USA. As of November 2010, the [[Roscoe Wind Farm]] is the largest onshore wind farm in the world, with a capacity of 781.5 [[Megawatt|MW]] of power, followed by the [[Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center]] (735.5 MW). As of February 2012, the [[Walney Wind Farm]] in [[United Kingdom]] is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 367 [[Megawatt|MW]], followed by [[Thanet Offshore Wind Project]] (300 MW), also in the UK.  . 

There are many large wind farms under construction and these include [[Anholt Offshore Wind Farm]] (400 MW), [[BARD Offshore 1]] (400 MW), [[Clyde Wind Farm]] (548 MW), [[Greater Gabbard wind farm]] (500 MW), [[Lincs Wind Farm]] (270 MW), [[London Array]] (1000 MW), [[Lower Snake River Wind Project]] (343 MW), [[Macarthur Wind Farm]] (420 MW), [[Shepherds Flat Wind Farm]] (845 MW), and [[Sheringham Shoal Offshore Wind Farm|Sheringham Shoal]] (317 MW).  . 

== Design ==. 
A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines, and cover an extended area of hundreds of square miles, but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes. A wind farm may be located offshore to take advantage of strong winds blowing over the surface of an ocean or lake.  .

As a general rule, economic wind generators require windspeed of 10&nbsp;mph (16&nbsp;km/h) or greater. An ideal location would have a near constant flow of non-turbulent wind throughout the year, with a minimum likelihood of sudden powerful bursts of wind. An important factor of turbine siting is also access to local demand or [[electric power transmission|transmission]] capacity.  . 

Usually sites are screened on the basis of a [[wind atlas]], and validated with wind measurements. [[Meteorology|Meteorological]] wind data alone is usually not sufficient for accurate siting of a large wind power project. Collection of site specific data for wind speed and direction is crucial to determining site potential<ref name=eweaFact>[http://books.google.com/books?id=W0dre8-5FAYC&printsec=frontcover&hl=da Wind energy-- the facts: a guide to the technology, economics and future of wind power] page 32 ''[[EWEA]]'' 2009.

The wind blows faster at higher altitudes because of the reduced influence of drag. The increase in velocity with altitude is most dramatic near the surface and is affected by topography, surface roughness, and upwind obstacles such as trees or buildings. Typically, the increase of wind speeds with increasing height follows a [[wind profile power law]], which predicts that wind speed rises proportionally to the seventh root of altitude. Doubling the altitude of a turbine, then, increases the expected wind speeds by 10% and the expected power by 34%.  . 

Individual turbines are interconnected with a medium voltage (usually 34.5 kV) power collection system and communications network. At a [[Electrical substation|substation]], this medium-voltage electrical current is increased in voltage with a [[transformer]] for connection to the high voltage transmission system. Construction of a land-based wind farm requires installation of the collector system and substation, and possibly access roads to each turbine site.  .

As of November 2010, the [[Roscoe Wind Farm]] is the largest onshore wind farm in the world at 781.5 [[Megawatt|MW]], followed by the [[Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center]] (735.5 MW). The largest wind farm under construction is the 845 MW [[Shepherds Flat Wind Farm]] in the USA. The largest proposed project is the 20,000 MW [[Gansu Wind Farm]] in China.  . 

Falling costs mean that the average onshore wind farm will be competitive with [[Natural gas power plant|natural gas-fired power generation]] by 2016. <ref>http://www.environmental-finance.com/news/view/2111</ref> .

[[wikt:onshore|Onshore]] turbine installations in hilly or mountainous regions tend to be on ridgelines generally three kilometers or more inland from the nearest shoreline. This is done to exploit the [[topographic acceleration]] as the wind accelerates over a ridge. The additional wind speeds gained in this way can increase energy produced because more wind goes through the turbines. The exact position of each turbines matters, because a difference of 30m could potentially double output. This careful placement is referred to as 'micro-siting'.  .

Europe is the leader in offshore wind energy, with the first offshore wind farm being installed in Denmark in 1991. As of 2010, there are 39 offshore wind farms in waters off Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom, with a combined operating capacity of 2,396 MW. More than 100 GW (or 100, 000 MW) of offshore projects are proposed or under development in Europe. The [[European Wind Energy Association]] has set a target of 40 GW installed by 2020 and 150 GW by 2030. <ref name=eesi2010>{{cite web |url=http://www.eesi.org/files/offshore_wind_101310.pdf |title=Offshore Wind Energy |author=[[Environmental and Energy Study Institute]] |date=October 2010}}</ref> . 

As of February 2012, the [[Walney Wind Farm]] in [[United Kingdom]] is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 367 [[Megawatt|MW]], followed by [[Thanet Offshore Wind Project]] (300 MW), also in the UK. The [[London Array]] (630 MW) is the largest project under construction.  .

Offshore wind turbines are less obtrusive than turbines on land, as their apparent size and noise is mitigated by distance. Because water has less surface roughness than land (especially deeper water), the average wind speed is usually considerably higher over open water. [[Capacity factor]]s (utilisation rates) are considerably higher than for onshore locations. <ref name="Garvinel2008">{{cite journal | last1 = Garvine | first1 = Richard | last2 = Kempton | first2 = Willett | title = Assessing the wind ﬁeld over the continental shelf as a resource for electric power | journal = Journal of Marine Research | year = 2008 | volume = 66 | issue = 6 | pages = 751–773 | issn = 0022-2402 | url = http://www.ceoe.udel.edu/windpower/docs/GarvineKemp-AssessingWind09.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2009-11-30 }}</ref> .

As of 2010, there are no offshore wind farms in the United States. However, projects are under development in wind-rich areas of the East Coast, Great Lakes, and Pacific coast. <ref name=eesi2010/> . 

Installation and service / maintenance of off-shore wind farms are a specific challenge for technology and economic operation of a wind farm. Service vessels have to be operated nearly 24/7 (availability higher than 80 % of time) to get suffcient amortisation from the wind turbines.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Therefore special fast service vehicles for installation (like Wind Turbine Shuttle) as well as for maintenance (including heave compensation and heave compensated working platforms to allow the service staff to enter the wind turbine also at difficult weather conditions) are required. So-called inertial and optical based Ship Stabilization and Motion Control systems (iSSMC) are used for that.  .

In 2006, the British government gave planning consent for the world's largest offshore wind farm, the '[[London Array]]'. It is currently being built 12 miles off of the [[Kent]] coast and will include 341 turbines when finished.  . 

An important limiting factor of wind power is [[intermittent power source|variable power]] generated by wind farms. In most locations the wind blows only part of the time, which means that there has to be back-up capacity of conventional generating capacity to cover periods that the wind is not blowing. To address this issue it has been proposed to create a "supergrid" to connect national grids together<ref>[http://www.technologyreview.com/Energy/16595/ Peter Fairley, A Supergrid for Europe: A radical proposal for a high-tech power grid could make possible the continent's vast expansion of renewable energy sources, MIT Technology Review, Wednesday, March 15, 2006]</ref> across [[western Europe]], ranging from [[Denmark]] across the southern [[North Sea]] to [[England]] and the [[Celtic Sea]] to [[Ireland]], and further south to [[France]] and [[Spain]] especially in [[Higueruela]] which was considered for some time the biggest wind farm in the world. <ref>[http://www.sabuco.com/mci/essays01/2b/energy2.pdf ''Renewable energy''] (PDF), p. 11. </ref> The idea is that by the time a [[low pressure area]] has moved away from Denmark to the [[Baltic Sea]] the next low appears off the coast of Ireland. Therefore, while it is true that the wind is not blowing everywhere all of the time, it will always be blowing somewhere.  .

Compared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources, the environmental impact of wind power is relatively minor. [[Wind power]] consumes no fuel, and emits no [[air pollution]], unlike fossil fuel power sources. The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months. While a wind farm may cover a large area of land, many land uses such as agriculture are compatible, with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use. <ref name=mar>[http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/WindPowersStrength.pdf  Why Australia needs wind power]</ref>  .

</ref> or may not be significant, depending on specific circumstances. Prevention and mitigation of wildlife fatalities, and protection of [[peat bogs]], affect the siting and operation of wind turbines.  . 

There are anecdotal reports of negative effects from noise on people who live very close to wind turbines. Peer-reviewed research has generally not supported these statements. <ref name='CanWEA09'>W.

=== Effect on power grid ===. 
{{See also|Wind power#Electricity generation}} . 

Utility-scale wind farms must have access to transmission lines to transport energy. The wind farm developer may be obligated to install extra equipment or control systems in the wind farm to meet the technical standards set by the operator of a transmission line. The company or person that develops the wind farm can then sell the power on the grid through the transmission lines and ultimately chooses whether to hold on to the rights or sell the farm or parts of it to big business like GE, for example.  . 

=== Ground radar interference ===. 
[[File:NOAA windturbine-radar-interference.gif|thumb|Wind farm interference (in yellow circle) on radar map]] . 

Wind farms can interfere with ground [[radar]] systems used for defense, [[Weather radar|weather]] and [[air traffic control]]. The large, rapidly moving blades of the turbines can return signals to the radar that can be mistaken as an aircraft or weather pattern. <ref name="noaaWR">[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/mkx/?n=windfarm Wind farm interference showing up on Doppler radar] ''[[National Weather Service]]''. Accessed: 9 February 2011. </ref>
Actual aircraft and weather patterns around wind farms can be accurately detected, as there is no fundamental physical constraint preventing that. But aging radar infrastructure is significantly challenged with the task. <ref name="fasWR">Brenner, Michael et al.

==== Effects ==== . 

The level of interference is a function of the signal processors used within the radar, the speed of the aircraft and the relative orientation of wind turbines/aircraft with respect to the radar. An aircraft flying above the wind farm's turning blades could become impossible to detect because the blade tips can be moving at nearly aircraft velocity. Studies are currently being performed to determine the level of this interference and will be used in future site planning. <ref name="gsnWR"/> Issues include masking (shadowing), clutter (noise), and signal alteration. <ref name="wefWR">[http://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org/de/environment/chapter-2-environmental-impacts/ship-collisions-radars-and-radio-signals.html Radars and radio signals] ''Wind Energy Facts''.

In early 2011, the U.S. government awarded a program to build a radar/wind turbine analysis tool. This tool will allow developers to predict the impact of a wind farm on a radar system before construction, thus allowing rearrangement of the turbines or even the entire wind farm to avoid negative impacts on the radar system. <ref name="gsnWR">Goodwin, Jacob.

A mobile radar system, the Lockheed Martin TPS-77, has shown in recent tests that it can distinguish between aircraft and wind turbines, and more than 170 TPS-77 radars are in use around the world. In Britain, the Lockheed Martin TPS-77 will be delivered and installed in November 2011 at Trimingham in Norfolk, removing military objections to a series of offshore wind farms in the North Sea. A second TPS-77 is to be installed in the Scottish Borders, overcoming objections to a 48-turbine wind farm at Fallago. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/windpower/8726922/Military-radar-deal-paves-way-for-more-wind-farms-across-Britain.html |title=Military radar deal paves way for more wind farms across Britain  |author=Robert Mendick |date=27 August 2011 |work= The Telegraph }}</ref> .

The professor of atmospheric science Somnath Baidya Roy of the [[University of Illinois]], in a study published in October 2010 in the scientific journal [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]]<ref name=agriwind1>Roy, Somnath Baidya. [http://www.pnas.org/content/107/42/17899.abstract?sid=47909b69-b82f-49d4-97d9-debb5d1ff65b Impacts of wind farms on surface air temperatures] ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'', 4 October 2010. Accessed: 10 March 2011. </ref> shows that in the immediate vicinity of wind farms, the climate is cooler during the day and slightly warmer during the night than the surrounding areas. According to Roy, the effect is due to the turbulence generated by the blades.  . 

In another study conducted by Gene Takle and Julie Lundquist [[University of Colorado]], presented at San Francisco conference of the [[American Geophysical Union]] Fall Meeting (December 13–18, 2010), the analysis carried out on corn and soybean crops in the central areas of the United States has noted that the microclimate generated by wind turbines improves crops as it prevents the spring and autumn frosts, and it reduces the action of pathogenic fungi that grow on the leaves. Even at the height of summer heat, the lowering of 2.5-3 degrees above the crops due to turbulence caused by the blades, can make a difference for the cultivation of maize. <ref name=agriwind2>Takle, Gene and Lundquist, Julie.
