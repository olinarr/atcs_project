'''Physical exercise''' is any bodily activity that enhances or maintains [[physical fitness]] and overall [[health]] and wellness. It is performed for various reasons including strengthening [[muscle]]s and the [[cardiovascular system]], honing [[sport|athletic]] skills, [[weight loss]] or maintenance, as well as for the purpose of enjoyment. Frequent and regular physical exercise boosts the [[immune system]], and helps prevent the "[[diseases of affluence]]" such as [[heart disease]], [[cardiovascular disease]], [[Type 2 diabetes]] and [[obesity]]. <ref>{{cite doi|10.1056/NEJM200007063430103}}</ref><ref>Hu., F., Manson, J., Stampfer, M., Graham, C., et al.

=== Types of exercise ===. 
Physical exercises are generally grouped into three types,<ref>{{Cite web

=== Categories of physical exercise ===. 
* [[Strength training]]
* [[Sport agility|Agility training]]
* [[Eccentric Training]]
Sometimes the terms 'dynamic' and 'static' are used. 'Dynamic' exercises such as steady running, tend to produce a lowering of the [[diastole|diastolic]] blood pressure during exercise, due to the improved blood flow. Conversely, static exercise (such as weight-lifting) can cause the [[systole (medicine)|systolic]] pressure to rise significantly (during the exercise).  . 

=== Categories ===. 
Physical exercise is used to improve physical skills. Physical skills fall into the following general categories: [[Endurance|Cardiovascular/respiratory endurance]], [[Endurance|Stamina]], [[Physical strength|Strength]], [[Flexibility (anatomy)|Flexibility]], [[Human power|Power]], [[Speed]], [[Motor coordination|Coordination]], [[Agility]], [[Balance (ability)|Balance]], and [[Accuracy]]. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://library.crossfit.com/free/pdf/CFJ-trial.pdf| accessdate = 2010-09-12

===Metabolic equivalent of task===. 
The Compendium of Physical Activities was developed for use in epidemiologic studies to standardize the assignment of [[metabolic equivalent of task]] (MET) intensities in physical activity questionnaires. The Compendium is list of physical activities and the associated energy cost of each activity. The original Compendium was published in 1993, the first update in 2000, and the most recent update in 2011. <ref name="bare_url">https://sites.google.com/site/compendiumofphysicalactivities/</ref> . 

MET (Metabolic Equivalent): The ratio of the work metabolic rate to the resting metabolic rate. One MET is defined as 1 kcal/kg/hour and is roughly equivalent to the energy cost of sitting quietly. A MET also is defined as oxygen uptake in ml/kg/min with one MET equal to the oxygen cost of sitting quietly, equivalent to 3.5 ml/kg/min.  .

Both aerobic and anaerobic exercise work to increase the mechanical efficiency of the heart by increasing cardiac volume (aerobic exercise), or myocardial thickness (strength training).  [[Ventricular hypertrophy|Such changes]] are generally beneficial and healthy if they occur in response to exercise.  . 

Not everyone benefits equally from exercise. There is tremendous variation in individual response to training; where most people will see a moderate increase in endurance from [[aerobic exercise]], some individuals will as much as double their oxygen uptake, while others can never augment endurance. <ref name="bouchard_fam">{{cite journal

=== Cardiovascular system ===. 
The beneficial effect of exercise on the cardiovascular system is well documented. There is a direct relation between physical inactivity and cardiovascular mortality, and physical inactivity is an independent risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease. There is a dose-response relation between the amount of exercise performed from approximately 700 to 2000 kcal of energy expenditure per week and all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality in middle-aged and elderly populations. The greatest potential for reduced mortality is in the sedentary who become moderately active. Most beneficial effects of physical activity on cardiovascular disease mortality can be attained through moderate-intensity activity (40% to 60% of maximal oxygen uptake, depending on age). ... persons who modify their behavior after myocardial infarction to include regular exercise have improved rates of survival. ... Persons who remain sedentary have the highest risk for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality. <ref>[http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/94/4/857 AHA: Physical activity recommendations]</ref> . 

=== Immune system === . 

Although there have been hundreds of studies on exercise and the [[immune system]], there is little direct evidence on its connection to illness. [[Epidemiology|Epidemiological]] evidence suggests that moderate exercise has a beneficial effect on the human [[immune system]]; an effect which is modeled in a [[J curve]]. Moderate exercise has been associated with a 29% decreased incidence of [[upper respiratory tract infection]]s (URTI), but studies of marathon runners found that their prolonged high-intensity exercise was associated with an increased risk of infection occurrence. However, another study did not find the effect. Immune cell functions are impaired following acute sessions of prolonged, high-intensity exercise, and some studies have found that athletes are at a higher risk for infections. The immune systems of athletes and nonathletes are generally similar. Athletes may have slightly elevated [[natural killer cell]] count and cytolytic action, but these are unlikely to be clinically significant. <ref name=Gleeson2007>{{cite journal |author=Gleeson M |title=Immune function in sport and exercise |journal=J. Appl. Physiol. |volume=103 |issue=2 |pages=693–9 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17303714 |doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00008.2007 |url=http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/103/2/693}}</ref> . 

Vitamin C supplementation has been associated with lower incidence of URTIs in marathon runners. <ref name=Gleeson2007/> . 

[[Biomarker]]s of [[inflammation]] such as [[C-reactive protein]], which are associated with chronic diseases, are reduced in active individuals relative to sedentary individuals, and the positive effects of exercise may be due to its anti-inflammatory effects. The depression in the immune system following acute bouts of exercise may be one of the mechanisms for this anti-inflammatory effect. <ref name=Gleeson2007/> . 

=== Brain function === . 

A 2008 review of cognitive enrichment therapies (strategies to slow or reverse cognitive decline) concluded that "physical activity, and aerobic exercise in particular, enhances older adults' cognitive function". <ref>{{cite journal | author = Hertzog C,  Kramer AF, Wilson S, Lindenberger U. | title = Enrichment Effects on Adult Cognitive Development: Can the Functional Capacity of Older Adults Be  | doi = 10.1111/j.1539-6053.2009.01034.x | url = http://www.psychologicalscience.org/journals/pspi/pdf/PSPI_9_1%20main_text.pdf |format=PDF| year = 2008 | journal = Psychological Science in the Public Interest | pages = 1–65 | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | accessdate = 2009-07-07}}</ref> . 

In mice, exercise improves cognitive functioning via improvement of [[hippocampus]]-dependent spatial learning, and enhancement of [[synaptic plasticity]] and [[neurogenesis]]. <ref>{{cite journal  | last = van Praag H, Kempermann G, Gage FH.  | title = Ontogeny Running increases cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the adult mouse dentate gyrus | journal = Nature Neuroscience. | volume = 2 | issue = 3  | pages = 266–70 | year = 1999 | format = Abstract  | doi = 10.1038/6368  | pmid = 10195220  | first1 = H  | last2 = Kempermann  | first2 = G  | last3 = Gage  | first3 = FH}}</ref> In addition, physical activity has been shown to be neuroprotective in many neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases. <ref>{{cite journal  | last = Clément Grondard  | title = Regular Exercise Prolongs Survival in a Type 2 Spinal Muscular Atrophy Model Mouse | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience. | volume = 25 | issue = 33  | pages = 7615–7622 | year = 2005  | doi =  10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1245-05.2005  | format = Abstract  | pmid = 16107648  | first1 = C  | last2 = Biondi  | first2 = O  | last3 = Armand  | first3 = AS  | last4 = Lécolle  | first4 = S  | last5 = Della Gaspera  | first5 = B  | last6 = Pariset  | first6 = C  | last7 = Li  | first7 = H  | last8 = Gallien  | first8 = CL  | last9 = Vidal  | first9 = PP  | author-separator = ,  | display-authors = 1}}</ref> For instance, it reduces the risk of developing [[dementia]]. <ref name=wvdhhr>[http://www.wvdhhr.org/bph/oehp/hsc/dementia/prevent.htm West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources]</ref> Furthermore, anecdotal evidence suggests that frequent exercise may reverse alcohol-induced brain damage. <ref>[http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/41/23/20 Could Exercise Regenerate Alcohol-Damaged Neurons? - Levin 41 (23): 20 - Psychiatr News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . 

There are several possibilities for why exercise is beneficial for the brain. Examples are as follows:
* increasing the blood and oxygen flow to the brain
* increasing growth factors that help [[neurogenesis|create new nerve cells]]<ref name="pmid10195220">{{cite journal |author=van Praag H, Kempermann G, Gage FH |title=Running increases cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the adult mouse dentate gyrus |journal=Nat.

=== Depression === . 

A number of factors may contribute to [[Depression (mood)|depression]] including being [[overweight]], low self esteem, stress, and anxiety. <ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk books?id=A6oIAAAACAAJ|title=Conquering Depression and Anxiety Through Exercise|author=Keith W.

=== Sleep === . 

A 2010 review of published scientific research suggested that exercise generally improves sleep for most people, and helps sleep disorders such as insomnia. The optimum time to exercise ''may'' be 4 to 8 hours before bedtime, though exercise at any time of day is beneficial, with the possible exception of heavy exercise taken shortly before bedtime, which may disturb sleep. There is, in any case, insufficient evidence to draw detailed conclusions about the relationship between exercise and sleep. <ref>Buman, M.P. and King, A.C.: "Exercise as a Treatment to Enhance Sleep", ''[[American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine]]'', Nov-Dec 2010. </ref> . 

===Excessive exercise===. 
Exercise is a [[Stress (medicine)|stressor]] and the stresses of exercise have a [[Catabolism|catabolic]] effect on the body—contractile proteins within muscles are consumed for energy, carbohydrates and fats are similarly consumed and [[connective tissue]]s are stressed and can form micro-tears.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} However, given adequate nutrition and sufficient rest to avoid [[overtraining]], the body's reaction to this stimulus is to adapt and replete tissues at a higher level than that existing before exercising.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The results are all the training effects of regular exercise: increased muscular strength, endurance, bone density, and connective tissue toughness.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} . 

Too much exercise can be harmful. Without proper rest, the chance of [[stroke]] or other [[Circulatory system|circulation]] problems increases,<ref>Alexander, C. 1998. Cutting weight, losing life. ''News & Observer, February 8, 1998'', A.1. Retrieved October 5, 2006, from ProQuest database. </ref> and muscle tissue may develop slowly.

Inappropriate exercise can do more harm than good, with the definition of "inappropriate" varying according to the individual. For many activities, especially [[running]] and [[cycling]], there are significant injuries that occur with poorly regimented exercise schedules. Injuries from accidents also remain a major concern,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Joris Aertsens, Bas de Geus, Grégory Vandenbulcke, Bart Degraeuwe, Steven Broekx, Leo De Nocker, Inge Liekens, Inge Mayeres, Romain Meeusen, Isabelle Thomas, Rudi Torfs, Hanny Willems, Luc Int Panis| year =2010 | title = Commuting by bike in Belgium, the costs of minor accidents| journal =  Accident Analysis and Prevention| volume =42 | pages = 2149–2157  | doi = 10.1016/j.aap.2010.07.008 | issue = 6 | pmid = 20728675}}</ref> whereas the effects of increased exposure to air pollution seem only a minor concern. <ref name="Int Panis">{{cite journal

In extreme instances, over-exercising induces serious performance loss. Unaccustomed overexertion of muscles leads to [[rhabdomyolysis]] (damage to muscle) most often seen in new army recruits. <ref>Jimenez, C., Pacheco, E., Moreno, A., Carpenter, A. 1996. A Soldier's Neck and Shoulder Pain. ''The Physician and Sportsmedicine, 24''(6), 81–82.

Stopping excessive exercise suddenly can also create a change in mood. Feelings of depression and agitation can occur when withdrawal from the natural endorphins produced by exercise occurs.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Exercise should be controlled by each body's inherent limitations. While one set of joints and muscles may have the tolerance to withstand multiple [[marathons]], another body may be damaged by 20 minutes of light jogging. This must be determined for each individual.  . 

Too much exercise can also cause a female to miss her period, a symptom known as [[amenorrhea]]. <ref>{{cite web

==Metabolic equivalent of task==. 
The Compendium of Physical Activities was developed for use in epidemiologic studies to standardize the assignment of [[metabolic equivalent of task]] (MET) intensities in physical activity questionnaires. The Compendium is list of physical activities and the associated energy cost of each activity. The original Compendium was published in 1993, the first update in 2000, and the most recent update in 2011. <ref name="bare_url" /> . 

MET (Metabolic Equivalent): The ratio of the work metabolic rate to the resting metabolic rate. One MET is defined as 1 kcal/kg/hour and is roughly equivalent to the energy cost of sitting quietly. A MET also is defined as oxygen uptake in ml/kg/min with one MET equal to the oxygen cost of sitting quietly, equivalent to 3.5 ml/kg/min.  . 

== Exercise trends ==. 
{{Main|Exercise trends}}
Worldwide there has been a large shift towards less physically demanding work. <ref name=WHO2009>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/publications/facts/obesity/en/ |title=WHO: Obesity and overweight |format= |work=World Health Organization |accessdate=January 10, 2009}}</ref> This has been accompanied by increasing use of mechanized transportation, a greater prevalence of labor saving technology in the home, and less active [[recreational pursuits]]. <ref name=WHO2009/> . 

== Nutrition and recovery ==. 
Proper [[nutrition]] is as important to health as exercise. When exercising, it becomes even more important to have a good diet to ensure that the body has the correct ratio of [[Macronutrient (nutrition)|macronutrients]] whilst providing ample [[micronutrient]]s, in order to aid the body with the recovery process following strenuous exercise. <ref>Kimber, N., Heigenhauser, G., Spriet, L., and Dyck, D. 2003. Skeletal muscle fat and carbohydrate metabolism during recovery from glycogen-depleting exercise in humans. ''The Journal of Phsyiology, 548''(Pt. 3), 919–927. </ref> . 

== History ==. 
The benefits of exercise have been known since antiquity. [[Marcus Cicero]], around 65 BC, stated: "It is exercise alone that supports the spirits, and keeps the mind in vigor."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inspirational-quotes-and-quotations.com/quotes-about-exercise.html |title=Quotes About Exercise Top 10 List |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>  However, the link between physical health and exercise (or lack of it) was only discovered in 1949 and reported in 1953 by a team led by [[Jerry Morris]]. <ref>{{cite news|first=Simon|last=Kuper|title=The man who invented exercise|newspaper=Financial Times|date=11 September 2009|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/e6ff90ea-9da2-11de-9f4a-00144feabdc0.html|accessdate=12 September 2009}}</ref><ref name="Morris1953">{{cite journal|journal=Lancet|year=1953|volume=265|issue=6795|pages=1053&ndash;7|title=Coronary heart-disease and physical activity of work|author=Morris JN, Heady JA, Raffle PA, Roberts CG, Parks JW|pmid=13110049|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(53)90665-5}}</ref>  Dr. Morris noted that men of similar social class and occupation (bus conductors versus bus drivers) had markedly different rates of heart attacks, depending on the level of exercise they got: bus drivers had a sedentary occupation and a higher incidence of heart disease, while bus conductors were forced to move continually and had a lower incidence of heart disease. <ref name="Morris1953"/>  This link had not previously been noted and was later confirmed by other researchers.  . 

==In other animals== . 

Physical exercise has been shown to benefit a wide range of other mammals, as well as salmon, crocodiles and one species of bird. <ref name="sciencedirect.com"> Physical exercise can vary from running to sexual encounters to swimming. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VNH-4S9P5W5-1&_user=489286&_coverDate=06/30/2008&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_origin=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_searchStrId=1627003341&_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&_acct=C000022678&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=489286&md5=7aac2f617fa79bd4def308921e73918b&searchtype=a Exercise training and aerobic capacity]</ref>  However, several studies have shown that lizards display no benefit from exercise, leading them to be termed "metabolically inflexible". <ref name="sciencedirect.com"/> .
