'''Girls on the Run''' is a North American non-profit program that works to encourage pre-teen girls to develop [[Self-esteem|self-respect]] and [[health]]y lifestyles through participation in [[running]] programs.  The organization’s curricula seek to address all aspects of the girls’ development to enhance their physical, emotional, mental, social, and spiritual [[well-being]].  . 

Local chapters operate under an [[umbrella organization]], Girls on the Run International, which develops curricula and provides support to the local chapters while encouraging the formation of additional chapters in areas not yet served by the program.  International has received inquiries from at least 43 countries around the world.  .
