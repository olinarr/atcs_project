'''[[Health|Physical]] [[education]]''' (often abbreviated '''Phys. Ed.''' or '''P.E.''') or '''[[gymnastics]]''' ('''[[gym]]''' or '''gym class''') is a course taken during primary and [[secondary education]] that encourages [[psychomotor learning]] in a play or movement exploration setting. <ref>Anderson, D. (1989). ''The Discipline and the Profession.'' Foundations of Canadian Physical Education, Recreation, and Sports Studies. Dubuque, IA: Wm. C. Brown Publishers. </ref> . 

==Trends==. 
Physical education trends have developed recently to incorporate a greater variety of activities. Introducing students to activities like bowling, walking/hiking, or Frisbee at an early age can help students develop good activity habits that will carry over into adulthood. Some teachers have even begun to incorporate stress-reduction techniques such as yoga and deep-breathing. Teaching non-traditional sports to students may also provide the necessary motivation for students to increase their activity, and can help students learn about different cultures. For example, while teaching a unit about lacrosse (in, say, Arizona, USA), students can also learn a little bit about the Native American cultures of the Northeast and Eastern Canada, where lacrosse originated. Teaching non-traditional (or non-native) sports provides a great opportunity to integrate academic concepts from other subjects as well (social studies from the example above), which may now be required of many P.E. teachers. The four aspects of P.E. are physical, mental, social, and emotional.  . 

Another trend is the incorporation of Health and Nutrition to the physical education curriculum. The Child Nutrition and WIC Re-authorization Act of 2004 required that all school districts with a federally funded school meal program develop wellness policies that address nutrition and physical activity. <ref>Pangrazi, Robert (2007) "Dynamic Physical Education for Elementary School Children" 15th ed. </ref> While teaching students sports and movement skills, P.E. teachers are now incorporating short health and nutrition lessons into the curriculum. This is more prevalent at the elementary school level, where students do not have a specific Health class. Recently most elementary schools have specific health classes for students as well as physical education class. With the recent outbreaks of diseases such as swine flu, school districts are making it mandatory for students to learn about practicing good hygiene along with other health topics. 
Today many states require Physical Education teachers to be certified to teach Health courses.  Many colleges and Universities offer both Physical Education and Health as one certification.  This push towards health education is beginning in the intermediate level, including lessons on bullying, self esteem and stress and anger management.  . 

In the USA, the physical education curriculum is designed to allow school pupils a full range of modern opportunities, dozens of sports and hundreds of carefully reviewed drills and exercises, including exposure to the education with the use of [[pedometer]], GPS, and heart rate monitors, as well as state-of-the-art exercise machines in the upper grades. Some [[martial arts]] classes, like [[wrestling]] in the United States, and [[Pencak Silat]] in France, [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]], are taught to teach children self-defense and to feel good about themselves. The physical education curriculum is designed to allow students to experience at least a minimum exposure to the following categories of activities: aquatics, conditioning activities, gymnastics, individual/dual sports, team sports, rhythms, and dance. Students are encouraged to continue to explore those activities in which they have a primary interest by effectively managing their community resources.  . 

In these areas, a planned sequence of learning experiences is designed to support a progression of student development. This allows kids through 6th grade to be introduced to sports, fitness, and teamwork in order to be better prepared for the middle and high school age. In 1975, the [[United States House of Representatives]] voted to require school physical education classes include [[coeducation|both genders]]. <ref>Vanderbilt Television News Archive http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=483834</ref> Some high school and some middle school PE classes are single-sex. Requiring individuals to participate in physical education activities, such as [[dodge ball]], [[flag football]], and other competitive sports remains a controversial subject because of the social impact these have on young children. It is, however, important to note that many school budgets have seen cutbacks and in some cases physical education programs have been cut.  . 

==Technology Use in Physical Education==. 
New technology in Physical education is playing a big role in classes. One of the most affordable and effective would be a simple tape recorder.  With the use of a tape recorder students can see the mistakes they're making in things such as a throwing motion or swinging form<ref>Wang, L., Myers, D., & Yanes, M. (2010). Creating student-centered learning experience through the assistance of high-end technology in physical education. Journal of Instructional Psychology, 37(4), 352-356. </ref>.  Studies show that students do find this more effective than having someone just telling them what they are doing wrong and trying to correct it<ref>Wang, L., Myers, D., & Yanes, M. (2010). Creating student-centered learning experience through the assistance of high-end technology in physical education. Journal of Instructional Psychology, 37(4), 352-356. </ref>.  Educators also found the use of other technologies such as pedometers and heart rate monitors very successful, using them to make step and heart rate goals for students<ref>Woods, M., Karp , G., Goc, H., & Perlman, D. (2008). Physical educators' usage. Physical Educator, 65(2), 82-99</ref>.  . 

Other technologies that can be used in a Physical Education setting would include projectors, GPS and even [[Wii]] systems such as Wii Fit and Dance Dance Revolution.  Projectors can be used to show students things such as proper form or how to play certain games.  GPS systems can be used to get students active in an outdoor setting and Wii systems like Wii Fit can be used by teachers to show students a good way to stay fit in and out of the classroom setting<ref>Grimes, G. (2011, November 21). Interview by M Massey [Personal Interview]. </ref> . 

==Worldwide==. 
In [[Korea]], it is mandatory for pupils to take 3 hours of PE through primary and secondary schools.  . 

In [[Portugal]], pupils from primary school could optionally join PE as an extra-curricular activity. From middle school to secondary school pupils must participate in PE classes 2 hours per week.  . 

In [[Singapore]], pupils from primary school through junior colleges are required to have 2 hours of PE every week, except during examination seasons. Pupils are able to play games like football, badminton, captain's ball, and basketball during most sessions. Unorthodox sports such as touchball, fencing, and skateboarding are occasionally played. In more prestigious secondary schools and in junior colleges, sports such as golf, tennis, shooting, and squash are played. A compulsory fitness exam, NAPFA, is conducted in every school once every year to assess the physical fitness of the pupils. Pupils are given a series of fitness tests (Pull-ups/Inclined pull-ups for girls, standing broad jump, sit-ups, sit-and-reach and 1.6&nbsp;km for primary [10-12 year-olds]/2.4&nbsp;km for secondary and junior college levels [13-18 year-olds]). Students are graded by gold, silver, bronze or fail. NAPFA for pre-enlistees serves as an indicator for an additional 2 months in the country's compulsory national service if they attain bronze or fail.  . 

In [[Malaysia]], pupils from primary schools to secondary schools are expected to do 2 periods or 1 hour of PE throughout the year except a week before [[examination]]. In most [[secondary schools]], games like [[badminton]], [[sepak takraw]], [[association football|football]], [[basketball]] and [[tennis]] are available. Pupils are allowed to bring their own sports equipment to the school with the authorization of the teacher. In most secondary schools, physical exams are rarely done, schools record pupils' heights, weights and how many push-ups they can do.  . 

In [[Scotland]], pupils are expected to do at least two periods of PE in first, second, third and fourth year. <!-- Is this per day, week, month? what? --> In fifth and sixth year, PE is voluntary.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} .

[[Sport Festival]] can be held during vacuum period, usually after [[examination]]. At this time students can compete each other by bringing own class' flag. Some universities such as [[Bandung Institute of Technology | ITB]] include PE in curriculum for [[freshmen]] .

In [[India]], '''Physical Education''' is an important subject in schools. Many students chose Physical Education as a subject against Language Subject Like [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], some time national language [[Hindi]] and some time local languages  like [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], because it is very scoring subject and very interesting. Assignments on Physical education increase the interest in Sports. Educational Bodies in India like [[Central Board of Secondary Education]] and [[Punjab School Education Board]] are in those which conduct examination on Physical Education in affiliated schools and collages.  .
