Worldwide there has been a large shift towards less physically demanding work. <ref name=WHO2009>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/publications/facts/obesity/en/ |title=WHO: Obesity and overweight |work=World Health Organization |accessdate=January 10, 2009}}</ref>  This has been accompanied by increasing use of mechanized transportation, a greater prevalence of labor saving technology in the home, and less active [[recreational pursuits]]. <ref name=WHO2009/>  At least 31% of the world's population does not get sufficient exercise. <ref name=WHOX>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_inactivity/en/index.html |title=WHO &#124; Physical Inactivity: A Global Public Health Problem |work=WHO |accessdate=February 22, 2009}}</ref>  This is true in almost all developed and developing countries,<ref name=WHOX/> and among children. <ref name=Kids2005/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Salmon J, Timperio A |title=Prevalence, trends and environmental influences on child and youth physical activity |journal=Med Sport Sci |volume=50 |issue= |pages=183–99 |year=2007 |pmid=17387258 |doi=10.1159/000101391 |url=}}</ref> . 

These exercise trends are contributing to the rising rates of chronic diseases including: [[obesity]], [[heart disease]], [[stroke]] and [[high cholesterol]]. <ref name=CDC2007>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/pubs/pubd/hestats/physicalactivity/physicalactivity.htm |title=N C H S - Health E Stats -  Physical Activity Among Adults: United States, 2000 and 2005 |work=CDC |accessdate=}}</ref>  Active transport ( walking, bicycling, etc. ) has been found to be inversely related to obesity in Europe, North America, and Australia. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Bassett DR, Pucher J, Buehler R, Thompson DL, Crouter SE |title=Walking, cycling, and obesity rates in Europe, North America, and Australia |journal=J Phys Act Health |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=795–814 |year=2008 |month=November |pmid=19164816 |doi= |url=}}</ref>  Thus exercise has been associated with a decrease in mortality. <ref name=CDC2007/> . 

==Causes of lack of exercise==. 
One of the causes most prevalent in the developing world is urbanization.  As more of the population moves to cities, population over-crowding, increased poverty, increased levels of crime, high-density traffic, low air quality and lack of parks, sidewalks and recreational sports facilities leads to a less active lifestyle. <ref name=WHOX/> . 

Physical inactivity is increasing or high among many groups in the population including: young people,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_young_people/en/index.html |title=WHO &#124; Physical Activity and Young People |work=WHO |accessdate=}}</ref> women,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_women/en/index.html |title=WHO &#124; Physical Activity and Women |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> and the elderly. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_olderadults/en/index.html |title=WHO &#124; Physical Activity and Older Adults |work=WHO |accessdate=}}</ref> . 

A number of factors has been associated with physical inactivity at a population level including: female gender, older age, living with a partner, smoking, little schooling and poverty. <ref name=Brazil2005/> . 

Studies in children and adults have found an association between the number of hours of television watched and the [[prevalence]] of obesity. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Gortmaker SL, Must A, Sobol AM, Peterson K, Colditz GA, Dietz WH |title=Television viewing as a cause of increasing obesity among children in the United States, 1986–1990 |journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med |volume=150 |issue=4 |pages=356–62 |year=1996 |month=April |pmid=8634729 |doi=10.1001/archpedi.1996.02170290022003}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Vioque J, Torres A, Quiles J |title=Time spent watching television, sleep duration and obesity in adults living in Valencia, Spain |journal=Int.

==Symptoms==. 
[[Noncommunicable diseases]], partly due to a lack of exercise, are currently the greatest [[public health]] problem in most countries around the world. <ref name=WHOX/>  Each year at least 1.9 million people die as a result of physical inactivity,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/moveforhealth/en/ |title=WHO &#124; Why "Move for Health" |work=WHO |accessdate=}}</ref>  which makes inactivity one of the leading [[preventable causes of death]] worldwide. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Lopez AD, Mathers CD, Ezzati M, Jamison DT, Murray CJ |title=Global and regional burden of disease and risk factors, 2001: systematic analysis of population health data |journal=Lancet |volume=367 |issue=9524 |pages=1747–57 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16731270 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68770-9 |url=}}</ref> .

Australian children between 1961 and 2002 have had a marked decline in their aerobic fitness. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Tomkinson GR, Olds TS |title=Secular changes in aerobic fitness test performance of Australasian children and adolescents |journal=Med Sport Sci |volume=50 |issue= |pages=168–82 |year=2007 |pmid=17387257 |doi=10.1159/0000101361 |url=}}</ref> . 

===Canada===. 
Obese people are less active than their normal weight counterparts.  In Canada, 27.0% of sedentary men are obese as opposed to 19.6% of active men. <ref name=Tjepkema2005>{{cite book | author=Tjepkema M | chapter=Measured Obesity–Adult obesity in Canada: Measured height and weight | title=Nutrition: Findings from the Canadian Community Health Survey | publisher=Statistics Canada | date=2005-07-06 | location=Ottawa, Ontario | url=http://www.statcan.ca/english/research/82-620-MIE/2005001/articles/adults/aobesity.htm}}</ref> Lean people are more fidgety than their obese counterparts; this relationship is maintained even if normal weight people eat more or the obese person loses weight. <ref>{{cite journal | author=Levine JA, Lanningham-Foster LM, McCrady SK, Krizan AC, Olson LR, Kane PH, Jensen MD, Clark MM | title=Interindividual variation in posture allocation: Possible role in human obesity | journal=Science | year=2005 | pages=584–6 | volume=307 | issue=5709 | pmid=15681386 | doi=10.1126/science.1106561}}</ref> . 

National data indicates that only 10% of Canadian youth are meeting the guideline for screen time of less than 2 hours per day.

===Asia and China===. 
A study from China found [[urbanization]] reduces daily energy expenditure by about 300–400 kcal and going to work by car or bus reduced it by a further 200 kcal. <ref name=James2008>{{cite journal |author=James WP |title=The fundamental drivers of the obesity epidemic |journal=Obes Rev |volume=9 |issue= s1|pages=6–13 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18307693 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-789X.2007.00432.x |url=}}</ref> . 

A rapid decline in physical activity has occurred between the 1980s and the 2000s.  The decline in physical activity is attributed to increasing technology in the workplace and changing leisure activities. <ref name=FAOChina>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0442e/a0442e06.htm |title=The double burden of malnutrition Case studies from six developing countries |work=Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN |accessdate=January 11, 2009}}</ref> In 1989 65% of Chinese had jobs that required heavy labor.

A study of Swedish males found a significant decrease in total physical exercise even though recreational exercise has increased.
