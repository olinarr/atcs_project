'''Obesity''' is a [[medical condition]] in which excess [[body fat]] has accumulated to the extent that it may have an adverse effect on health, leading to reduced [[life expectancy]] and/or increased health problems. <ref name="WHO 2000 p.6">WHO 2000 p.6</ref><ref name=HaslamJames/> [[Body mass index]] (BMI), a measurement which compares [[Human weight|weight]] and height, defines people as [[overweight]] (pre-obese) if their BMI is between 25 and 30&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and obese when it is greater than 30&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. <ref name="WHO 2000 p.9">WHO 2000 p.9</ref> . 

Obesity increases the likelihood of [[Obesity associated morbidity|various diseases]], particularly [[cardiovascular diseases|heart disease]], [[diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]], [[obstructive sleep apnea]], certain types of [[cancer]], and [[osteoarthritis]]. <ref name=HaslamJames/>  Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive [[food energy]] intake, lack of physical activity, and [[Polygenic inheritance|genetic susceptibility]], although a few cases are caused primarily by [[gene]]s, [[endocrine]] disorders, [[medication]]s or [[psychiatric illness]].  Evidence to support the view that some obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is limited; on average obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their thin counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass. <ref>{{cite book |author=Kushner, Robert |title=Treatment of the Obese Patient (Contemporary Endocrinology) |publisher=Humana Press |location=Totowa, NJ |year=2007 |page=158 |isbn=1-59745-400-1 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=vWjK5etS7PMC&pg=PA121&lpg=PA121&dq=measurement+of+metabolism+in+obese+Bessesen |doi= |accessdate=April 5, 2009}}</ref><ref name=Anes2000>{{cite journal |author=Adams JP, Murphy PG |title=Obesity in anaesthesia and intensive care |journal=Br J Anaesth |volume=85 |issue=1 |pages=91–108 |year=2000 |month=July |pmid=10927998 |doi= 10.1093/bja/85.1.91|url=http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/85/1/91}}</ref> . 

[[Dieting]] and [[physical exercise]] are the mainstays of treatment for obesity. Moreover, it is important to improve diet quality by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods such as those high in fat and sugars, and by increasing the intake of [[dietary fiber]]. To supplement this, or in case of failure, [[anti-obesity drug]]s may be taken to reduce appetite or inhibit fat absorption. In severe cases, [[bariatric surgery|surgery]] is performed or an intragastric balloon is placed to reduce stomach volume and/or bowel length, leading to earlier satiation and reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food. <ref>NICE 2006 p.10–11</ref><ref name=balloon2008>{{cite journal |author=Imaz I, Martínez-Cervell C, García-Alvarez EE, Sendra-Gutiérrez JM, González-Enríquez J |title=Safety and effectiveness of the intragastric balloon for obesity.

==Classification==. 
{{Main|Classification of obesity}}
Obesity is a [[medical condition]] in which excess [[body fat]] has accumulated to the extent that it may have an adverse effect on health. <ref name="WHO 2000 p.6"/> It is defined by [[body mass index|body mass index (BMI)]] and further evaluated in terms of fat distribution via the [[waist-hip ratio|waist–hip ratio]] and total cardiovascular risk factors. <ref>{{cite journal |journal= Nutr J |year=2007 |volume=6 |page=32 |title= Measurement and Definitions of Obesity In Childhood and Adolescence: A field guide for the uninitiated |author= Sweeting HN |doi=10.1186/1475-2891-6-32|pmid=17963490 |url=http://www.nutritionj.com/content/6/1/32 |pmc= 2164947 |issue=1}}</ref><ref>NHLBI p.xiv</ref>  BMI is closely related to both [[Body fat percentage|percentage body fat]] and total body fat. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Gray DS, Fujioka K |title=Use of relative weight and Body Mass Index for the determination of adiposity |journal=J Clin Epidemiol |volume=44 |issue=6 |pages=545–50 |year=1991 |pmid=2037859 |doi= 10.1016/0895-4356(91)90218-X|url=}}</ref> .

In children, a healthy weight varies with age and sex.

BMI is calculated by dividing the subject's mass by the square of his or her height, typically expressed either in [[Metric system|metric]] or [[US customary units|US "customary"]] units: . 

:Metric:  <math>BMI=kilograms/meters^2</math> . 

:US customary and [[Imperial System|imperial]]: <math>BMI=lb*703/in^2</math> . 

where <math>lb</math> is the subject's weight in [[pound (mass)|pounds]] and <math>in</math> is the subject's height in inches.  . 

The most commonly used definitions, established by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) in 1997 and published in 2000, provide the values listed in the table at right. <ref name="WHO 2000 p.9"/> . 

Some modifications to the WHO definitions have been made by particular bodies. The surgical literature breaks down "class III" obesity into further categories whose exact values are still disputed. <ref name=morbid2007>{{cite journal |author=Sturm R |title=Increases in morbid obesity in the USA: 2000–2005 |journal=Public Health |volume=121 |issue=7 |pages=492–6 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17399752 |pmc=2864630 |doi=10.1016/j.puhe.2007.01.006 |url=}}</ref> .

===Morbidity===. 
{{Main|Obesity-associated morbidity}}
Obesity increases the risk of many physical and mental conditions. These comorbidities are most commonly shown in [[metabolic syndrome]],<ref name=HaslamJames/>  a combination of medical disorders which includes: [[diabetes mellitus type 2]], [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[hypercholesterolemia|high blood cholesterol]], and [[hypertriglyceridemia|high triglyceride levels]]. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Grundy SM |title=Obesity, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease |journal=J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. |volume=89 |issue=6 |pages=2595–600 |year=2004 |pmid=15181029 |doi=10.1210/jc.2004-0372}}</ref> . 

Complications are either directly caused by obesity or indirectly related through mechanisms sharing a common cause such as a poor diet or a [[sedentary lifestyle]]. The strength of the link between obesity and specific conditions varies. One of the strongest is the link with [[type 2 diabetes]]. Excess body fat underlies 64% of cases of diabetes in men and 77% of cases in women. <ref>Seidell 2005 p.9</ref> . 

Health consequences fall into two broad categories: those attributable to the effects of increased fat mass (such as [[osteoarthritis]], [[obstructive sleep apnea]], social stigmatization) and those due to the increased number of [[fat cells]] ([[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[cancer]], [[cardiovascular disease]], [[non-alcoholic fatty liver disease]]). <ref name=HaslamJames/><ref name=Bray2004>{{cite journal |author=Bray GA |title=Medical consequences of obesity |journal=J.

===Survival paradox===. 
{{See also|Obesity paradox}}
Although the negative health consequences of obesity in the general population are well supported by the available evidence, health outcomes in certain subgroups seem to be improved at an increased BMI, a phenomenon known as the obesity survival paradox. <ref name=Schmidt2007>{{cite journal |author=Schmidt DS, Salahudeen AK |title=Obesity-survival paradox-still a controversy? |journal=Semin Dial |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=486–92 |year=2007 |pmid=17991192 |doi=10.1111/j.1525-139X.2007.00349.x}}</ref> The paradox was first described in 1999 in overweight and obese people undergoing hemodialysis,<ref name=Schmidt2007/> and has subsequently been found in those with [[heart failure]] and [[Peripheral vascular disease|peripheral artery disease]] (PAD). <ref name=paradox2003>{{cite journal |author= |title=Behavioral counseling in primary care to promote a healthy diet: recommendations and rationale |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=67 |issue=12 |pages=2573–6 |year=2003 |month=June |pmid=12825847 |doi= |author1= U.S. Preventive Services Task Force }}</ref> . 

In people with heart failure, those with a BMI between 30.0 and 34.9 had lower mortality than those with a normal weight.

A 2006 review identified ten other possible contributors to the recent increase of obesity: (1) insufficient sleep, (2) [[endocrine disruptor]]s (environmental [[pollutant]]s that interfere with lipid metabolism), (3) decreased variability in ambient temperature, (4) decreased rates of [[tobacco smoking|smoking]], because smoking suppresses appetite, (5) increased use of medications that can cause weight gain (e.g., [[atypical antipsychotics]]), (6) proportional increases in ethnic and age groups that tend to be heavier, (7) pregnancy at a later age (which may cause susceptibility to obesity in children), (8) [[epigenetic]] risk factors passed on generationally, (9) [[natural selection]] for higher BMI, and (10) [[assortative mating]] leading to increased concentration of obesity risk factors (this would  increase the number of obese people by increasing population variance in weight). <ref name="pmid16801930">{{cite journal |author=Keith SW, Redden DT, Katzmarzyk PT, ''et al.'' |title=Putative contributors to the secular increase in obesity: Exploring the roads less traveled |journal=Int J Obes (Lond) |volume=30 |issue=11 |pages=1585–94 |year=2006 |pmid=16801930 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijo.0803326 |url=http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v30/n11/full/0803326a.html}}</ref> While there is substantial evidence supporting the influence of these mechanisms on the increased prevalence of obesity, the evidence is still inconclusive, and the authors state that these are probably less influential than the ones discussed in the previous paragraph.  .

Like many other medical conditions, obesity is the result of an interplay between genetic and environmental factors. [[Polymorphism (biology)|Polymorphism]]s in various [[gene]]s controlling [[appetite]] and [[metabolism]] predispose to obesity when sufficient food energy present.  As of 2006 more than 41 of these sites have been linked to the development of obesity when a favorable environment is present. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Poirier P, Giles TD, Bray GA, ''et al.'' |title=Obesity and cardiovascular disease: pathophysiology, evaluation, and effect of weight loss |journal=Arterioscler.

Studies that have focused upon inheritance patterns rather than upon specific genes have found that 80% of the offspring of two obese parents were obese, in contrast to less than 10% of the offspring of two parents who were of normal weight. <ref>{{cite book |author=Kolata,Gina |title=Rethinking thin: The new science of weight loss – and the myths and realities of dieting |publisher=Picador |location= |year=2007 |page=122 |isbn=0-312-42785-9}}</ref> . 

The [[thrifty gene hypothesis]] postulates that due to dietary scarcity during human evolution people are prone to obesity. Their ability to take advantage of rare periods of abundance by storing energy as fat would be advantageous during times of varying food availability, and individuals with greater adipose reserves would be more likely survive [[famine]]. This tendency to store fat, however, would be maladaptive in societies with stable food supplies. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Chakravarthy MV, Booth FW |title=Eating, exercise, and "thrifty" genotypes: Connecting the dots toward an evolutionary understanding of modern chronic diseases |journal=J.

===Social determinants===. 
{{Main|Social determinants of obesity}}
While genetic influences are important to understanding obesity, they cannot explain the current dramatic increase seen within specific countries or globally. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Yach D, Stuckler D, Brownell KD |title=Epidemiologic and economic consequences of the global epidemics of obesity and diabetes |journal=Nat. Med. |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=62–6 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16397571 |doi=10.1038/nm0106-62 |url=}}</ref> Though it is accepted that energy consumption in excess of energy expenditure leads to obesity on an individual basis, the cause of the shifts in these two factors on the societal scale is much debated. There are a number of theories as to the cause but most believe it is a combination of various factors.  . 

The correlation between [[social class]] and BMI varies globally. A review in 1989 found that in developed countries women of a high social class were less likely to be obese. No significant differences were seen among men of different social classes. In the developing world, women, men, and children from high social classes had greater rates of obesity. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Sobal J, Stunkard AJ |title=Socioeconomic status and obesity: A review of the literature |journal=Psychol Bull |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=260–75 |year=1989 |month=March |pmid=2648443 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.105.2.260}}</ref> An update of this review carried out in 2007 found the same relationships, but they were weaker.

Many explanations have been put forth for associations between BMI and social class. It is thought that in developed countries, the wealthy are able to afford more nutritious food, they are under greater social pressure to remain slim, and have more opportunities along with greater expectations for [[physical fitness]]. In [[undeveloped countries]] the ability to afford food, high energy expenditure with physical labor, and cultural values favoring a larger body size are believed to contribute to the observed patterns. <ref name=McLaren2007/> Attitudes toward body mass held by people in one's life may also play a role in obesity. A correlation in BMI changes over time has been found among friends, siblings, and spouses. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Christakis NA, [[James H.

Smoking has a significant effect on an individual's weight.

In the United States the number of children a person has is related to their risk of obesity.

Consistent with [[cognitive epidemiology|cognitive epidemiological]] data, numerous studies confirm that obesity is  associated with cognitive deficits. <ref name="Smith2011"> {{cite journal| doi=10.1111/j.1467-789X.2011.00920.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-789X.2011.00920.x/abstract|doi_brokendate=1-1-2012}}</ref> Whether obesity causes cognitive deficits, or vice versa is unclear at present.  . 

===Infectious agents===. 
{{See also|Infectobesity}}
The study of the effect of infectious agents on metabolism is still in its early stages.  [[Gut flora]] has been shown to differ between lean and obese humans. There is an indication that gut flora in obese and lean individuals can affect the metabolic potential. This apparent alteration of the metabolic potential is believed to confer a greater capacity to harvest energy contributing to obesity. Whether these differences are the direct cause or the result of obesity has yet to be determined unequivocally. <ref>{{cite journal |author=DiBaise JK, Zhang H, Crowell MD, Krajmalnik-Brown R, Decker GA, Rittmann BE |title=Gut microbiota and its possible relationship with obesity |journal=Mayo Clinic proceedings.

Since this discovery, many other hormonal mechanisms have been elucidated that participate in the regulation of [[appetite]] and food intake, storage patterns of [[adipose tissue]], and development of [[insulin resistance]]. Since leptin's discovery, [[ghrelin]], [[insulin]], [[orexin]], [[PYY 3-36]], [[cholecystokinin]], [[adiponectin]], as well as many other mediators have been studied. The [[adipokine]]s are mediators produced by adipose tissue; their action is thought to modify many obesity-related diseases.  . 

Leptin and ghrelin are considered to be complementary in their influence on appetite, with ghrelin produced by the stomach modulating short-term appetitive control (i.e. to eat when the stomach is empty and to stop when the stomach is stretched). Leptin is produced by adipose tissue to signal fat storage reserves in the body, and mediates long-term appetitive controls (i.e. to eat more when fat storages are low and less when fat storages are high). Although administration of leptin may be effective in a small subset of obese individuals who are leptin deficient, most obese individuals are thought to be leptin resistant and have been found to have high levels of leptin. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Hamann A, Matthaei S |title=Regulation of energy balance by leptin |journal=Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. Diabetes |volume=104 |issue=4 |pages=293–300 |year=1996 |pmid=8886745 |doi=10.1055/s-0029-1211457}}</ref> This resistance is thought to explain in part why administration of leptin has not been shown to be effective in suppressing appetite in most obese people. <ref name="flier"/> . 

[[File:Leptin.png|thumb|left|alt=A three dimensional model with two pairs of opposed curling columns attached together at their ends by more linear segments.|A graphic depiction of a [[leptin]] molecule]]
While leptin and ghrelin are produced peripherally, they control appetite through their actions on the [[central nervous system]]. In particular, they and other appetite-related hormones act on the [[hypothalamus]], a region of the brain central to the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. There are several circuits within the hypothalamus that contribute to its role in integrating appetite, the [[melanocortin]] pathway being the most well understood. <ref name="flier"/> The circuit begins with an area of the hypothalamus, the [[arcuate nucleus]], that has outputs to the [[lateral hypothalamus]] (LH) and [[ventromedial hypothalamus]] (VMH), the brain's feeding and satiety centers, respectively. <ref>{{cite book |author=Boulpaep, Emile L.; Boron, Walter F. |title=Medical physiologya: A cellular and molecular approach |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2003 |page=1227 |isbn=0-7216-3256-4}}</ref> . 

The arcuate nucleus contains two distinct groups of [[neuron]]s. <ref name="flier"/> The first group coexpresses [[neuropeptide Y]] (NPY) and [[agouti-related peptide]] (AgRP) and has stimulatory inputs to the LH and inhibitory inputs to the VMH. The second group coexpresses [[pro-opiomelanocortin]] (POMC) and [[cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript]] (CART) and has stimulatory inputs to the VMH and inhibitory inputs to the LH. Consequently, NPY/AgRP neurons stimulate feeding and inhibit satiety, while POMC/CART neurons stimulate satiety and inhibit feeding. Both groups of arcuate nucleus neurons are regulated in part by leptin. Leptin inhibits the NPY/AgRP group while stimulating the POMC/CART group. Thus a deficiency in leptin signaling, either via leptin deficiency or leptin resistance, leads to overfeeding and may account for some genetic and acquired forms of obesity. <ref name="flier"/>

Comprehensive approaches are being looked at to address the rising rates of obesity. The Obesity Policy Action (OPA) framework divides measure into 'upstream' policies, 'midstream' policies, 'downstream' policies. 'Upstream' policies look at changing society, 'midstream' policies try to alter individuals' behavior to prevent obesity, and 'downstream' policies try to treat currently afflicted people. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Sacks G, Swinburn B, Lawrence M |title=Obesity Policy Action framework and analysis grids for a comprehensive policy approach to reducing obesity |journal=Obes Rev |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=76–86 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=18761640|doi=10.1111/j.1467-789X.2008.00524.x |url=}}</ref> .

==History==. 
===Etymology===. 
''Obesity'' is from the [[Latin]] ''obesitas'', which means "stout, fat, or plump."  ''Ēsus'' is the past participle of ''edere'' (to eat), with ''ob'' (over) added to it. <ref name=etymol>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=obesity |title=Online Etymology Dictionary: Obesity |work=Douglas Harper |accessdate=December 31, 2008}}</ref>  ''[[The Oxford English Dictionary]]'' documents its first usage in 1611 by [[Randle Cotgrave]]. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oed.com/ |title=Obesity, n |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] 2008 |accessdate=March 21, 2009}}</ref> .

It was common among high officials in Europe in the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]<ref name=Zach2003/> as well as in Ancient East Asian civilizations. <ref>Keller p. 49</ref> . 

With the onset of the [[industrial revolution]] it was realized that the military and economic might of nations were dependent on both the body size and strength of their soldiers and workers. <ref name=Caballero/> Increasing the average body mass index from what is now considered underweight to what is now the normal range played a significant role in the development of industrialized societies. <ref name=Caballero/> Height and weight thus both increased through the 19th&nbsp;century in the developed world. During the 20th century, as populations reached their genetic potential for height, weight began increasing much more than height, resulting in obesity. <ref name=Caballero/> In the 1950s increasing wealth in the developed world decreased child mortality, but as body weight increased heart and kidney disease became more common. <ref name=Caballero/><ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.2105/AJPH.42.9.1116 | author=Breslow L | title=Public Health Aspects of Weight Control | journal=Am J Public Health Nations Health | year=1952 | month=September | volume=42 | issue=9 | pages=1116–20 | pmid=12976585 | pmc=1526346}}</ref>
During this time period insurance companies realized the connection between weight and life expectancy and increased premiums for the obese. <ref name=HaslamJames/> . 

Many cultures throughout history have viewed obesity as the result of a character flaw. The ''obesus'' or fat character in [[Greek comedy]] was a glutton and figure of mockery. During Christian times food was viewed as a gateway to the sins of [[sloth]] and [[lust]]. <ref name=Woodhouse/> In modern Western culture, excess weight is often regarded as unattractive, and obesity is commonly associated with various negative stereotypes. People of all ages can face social stigmatization, and may be targeted by bullies or shunned by their peers. Obesity is once again a reason for discrimination. <ref name=Bias2001>{{cite journal |author=Puhl R, Brownell KD |title=Bias, discrimination, and obesity |journal=Obes. Res. |volume=9 |issue=12 |pages=788–805 |year=2001 |month=December |pmid=11743063 |doi=10.1038/oby.2001.108 |url=}}</ref> .

Public perceptions in Western society regarding healthy body weight differ from those regarding the weight that is considered ideal &nbsp;– and both have changed since the beginning of the 20th century. The weight that is viewed as an ideal has become lower since the 1920s. This is illustrated by the fact that the average height of Miss America pageant winners increased by 2% from 1922 to 1999, while their average weight decreased by 12%. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Rubinstein S, Caballero B |title=Is Miss America an undernourished role model? |journal=JAMA |volume=283 |issue=12 |page=1569 |year=2000 |pmid=10735392 |doi= 10.1001/jama.283.12.1569|url=}}</ref>  On the other hand, people's views concerning healthy weight have changed in the opposite direction. In Britain the weight at which people considered themselves to be overweight was significantly higher in 2007 than in 1999. <ref name=John2008>{{cite journal |author=Johnson F, Cooke L, Croker H, Wardle J |title=Changing perceptions of weight in Great Britain: comparison of two population surveys |journal=BMJ |volume=337 |issue= |pages=a494 |year=2008 |pmid=18617488 |pmc=2500200 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.a494|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/337/jul10_1/a494}}</ref>  These changes are believed to be due to increasing rates of adiposity leading to increased acceptance of extra body fat as being normal. <ref name=John2008/> . 

Obesity is still seen as a sign of wealth and well-being in many parts of [[Africa]]. This has become particularly common since the [[HIV]] epidemic began. <ref name=HaslamJames/> . 

===The arts===. 
The first sculptural representations of the human body 20,000–35,000&nbsp;years ago depict obese females. Some attribute the [[Venus figurines]] to the tendency to emphasize fertility while others feel they represent "fatness" in the people of the time. <ref name=Woodhouse/> Corpulence is, however, absent in both Greek and Roman art, probably in keeping with their ideals regarding moderation. This continued through much of Christian European history, with only those of low socioeconomic status being depicted as obese. <ref name=Woodhouse/> . 

During the [[Renaissance]] some of the upper class began flaunting their large size, as can be seen in portraits of Henry the VIII and Alessandro del Borro. <ref name=Woodhouse>{{cite journal |author=Woodhouse R |title=Obesity in art: A brief overview |journal=Front Horm Res |volume=36 |issue= |pages=271–86 |year=2008 |isbn=978-3-8055-8429-6 |pmid=18230908 |doi=10.1159/000115370 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=nXRU4Ea1aMkC&pg=PA271&lpg=PA271&dq=Obesity+in+art:+a+brief+overview |series=Frontiers of Hormone Research}}</ref> [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] (1577–1640) regularly depicted full-bodied women in his pictures, from which derives the term [[Rubenesque]].

Some research shows that obese people are less likely to be hired for a job and are less likely to be promoted. <ref name=Bias2001/> Obese people are also paid less than their non-obese counterparts for an equivalent job. Obese women on average make 6% less and obese men make 3% less. <ref>Puhl R., Henderson K., and Brownell K. 2005 p.30</ref> . 

Specific industries, such as the airline and food industries, have special concerns. Due to rising rates of obesity, airlines face higher fuel costs and pressures to increase seating width. <ref>{{cite web | author=Lisa DiCarlo | url=http://www.forbes.com/2002/10/24/cx_ld_1024obese.html |title=Why Airlines Can't Cut The Fat|work=Forbes.com |date=2002-10-24 | accessdate=2008-07-23}}</ref> In 2000, the extra weight of obese passengers cost airlines US$275&nbsp;million. <ref>{{cite journal|author=Dannenberg AL, Burton DC, Jackson RJ |title=Economic and environmental costs of obesity: The impact on airlines |journal=American journal of preventive medicine|volume=27 |issue=3 |page=264 |year=2004 |pmid=15450642 |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2004.06.004}}</ref>  Costs for restaurants are increased by litigation accusing them of causing obesity. <ref name=Govtrack>{{cite web | url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-554 | title=109th U.S. Congress (2005–2006) H.R. 554: 109th U.S. Congress (2005–2006) H.R. 554: Personal Responsibility in Food Consumption Act of 2005 | publisher=GovTrack.us | accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref> In 2005 the US Congress discussed legislation to prevent civil law suits against the food industry in relation to obesity; however, it did not become law. <ref name=Govtrack/> . 

===Size acceptance===. 
[[File:PresidentTaftTelephoneCrop.jpg|thumb|150px|right|right|United States President [[William Howard Taft]] was often ridiculed for being overweight]]
{{See also|Fat acceptance movement}}
The principal goal of the fat acceptance movement is to decrease discrimination against people who are overweight and obese. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.capitalnaafa.org/whatisnaafa.html |title=What is NAAFA |work=[[National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance]] |accessdate=February 17, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.size-acceptance.org/mission.html |title=ISAA Mission Statement |work=[[International Size Acceptance Association]] |accessdate=February 17, 2009}}</ref> However, some in the movement are also attempting to challenge the established relationship between obesity and negative health outcomes. <ref name=Pulver2007>{{cite book |author=Pulver, Adam |title=An Imperfect Fit: Obesity, Public Health, and Disability Anti-Discrimination Law |publisher=Social Science Electronic Publishing |location= |year=2007 |pages= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1316106|accessdate=January 13, 2009}}</ref> . 

A number of organizations exist that promote the acceptance of obesity. They have increased in prominence in the latter half of the 20th&nbsp;century. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Neumark-Sztainer D |title=The weight dilemma: a range of philosophical perspectives |journal=Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. |volume=23 Suppl 2 |issue= |pages=S31–7 |year=1999 |month=March |pmid=10340803 |doi= 10.1038/sj.ijo.0800857|url=}}</ref> The US-based [[National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance]] (NAAFA) was formed in 1969 and describes itself as a civil rights organization dedicated to ending size discrimination. <ref>{{cite | author=National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance | url=http://www.naafaonline.com/dev2/ | title=We come in all sizes | publisher=NAAFA | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-07-29}}</ref> However, fat activism remains a marginal movement. <ref>[http://www.bitchmagazine.org/article/big-trouble Big Trouble | Bitch Magazine<!--Bot-generated title-->], bitchmagazine.org</ref> . 

The [[International Size Acceptance Association]] (ISAA) is a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) which was founded in 1997. It has more of a global orientation and describes its mission as promoting size acceptance and helping to end weight-based discrimination. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.size-acceptance.org/ |title=International Size Acceptance Association – ISAA |work=International Size Acceptance Association |accessdate=January 13, 2009}}</ref> These groups often argue for the recognition of obesity as a disability under the US [[Americans With Disabilities Act]] (ADA). The American legal system, however, has decided that the potential public health costs exceed the benefits of extending this anti-discrimination law to cover obesity. <ref name=Pulver2007/> . 

==Childhood obesity==. 
{{Main|Childhood obesity}}
The healthy BMI range varies with the age and sex of the child. Obesity in children and adolescents is defined as a BMI greater than the 95th&nbsp;[[percentile]]. <ref name="cdc.gov"/> The reference data that these percentiles are based on is from 1963 to 1994 and thus has not been affected by the recent increases in rates of obesity. <ref name="Flegal KM, Ogden CL, Wei R, Kuczmarski RL, Johnson CL 2001 1086–93"/> Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in 21st&nbsp;century, with rising rates in both the developed and developing world. Rates of obesity in Canadian boys have increased from 11% in 1980s to over 30% in 1990s, while during this same time period rates increased from 4 to 14% in Brazilian children. <ref name=flynn2006/> . 

As with obesity in adults, many different factors contribute to the rising rates of childhood obesity. Changing diet and decreasing physical activity are believed to be the two most important in causing the recent increase in the rates. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Dollman J, Norton K, Norton L |title=Evidence for secular trends in children's physical activity behaviour |journal=Br J Sports Med |volume=39 |issue=12 |pages=892–7; discussion 897 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16306494 |pmc=1725088 |doi=10.1136/bjsm.2004.016675 |url=}}</ref> Because childhood obesity often persists into adulthood and is associated with numerous chronic illnesses, children who are obese are often tested for [[hypertension]], [[diabetes]], [[hyperlipidemia]], and [[fatty liver]]. <ref name=CADG2006/> Treatments used in children are primarily lifestyle interventions and behavioral techniques. In the United States, medications are not FDA approved for use in this age group. <ref name=flynn2006>{{cite journal |author=Flynn MA, McNeil DA, Maloff B, ''et al.'' |title=Reducing obesity and related chronic disease risk in children and youth: a synthesis of evidence with 'best practice' recommendations |journal=Obes Rev |volume=7 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=7–66 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16371076 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-789X.2006.00242.x |url=}}</ref> . 

==In other animals==. 
{{Main|Obesity in pets}}
Obesity in pets is common in many countries. Rates of overweight and obesity in dogs in the United States range from 23% to 41% with about 5.1% obese. <ref name=Lund2006>{{cite journal|author=Lund Elizabeth M.|title=Prevalence and Risk Factors for Obesity in Adult Dogs from Private US Veterinary Practices|journal=Intern J Appl Res Vet Med|volume=4|issue=2|pages=177–86|year=2006|pmid= |doi= |url=http://www.jarvm.com/articles/Vol4Iss2/Lund.pdf}}</ref> Rates of obesity in cats was slightly higher at 6.4%. <ref name= Lund2006/> In Australia the rate of obesity among dogs in a veterinary setting has been found to be 7.6%. <ref>{{cite journal |author=McGreevy PD, Thomson PC, Pride C, Fawcett A, Grassi T, Jones B|title=Prevalence of obesity in dogs examined by Australian veterinary practices and the risk factors involved|journal=Vet. Rec.|volume=156|issue=22|pages=695–702|year=2005|month=May |pmid=15923551|doi= |url= }}</ref> The risk of obesity in dogs is related to whether or not their owners are obese; however, there is no similar correlation between cats and their owners. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Nijland ML, Stam F, Seidell JC|title= Overweight in dogs, but not in cats, is related to overweight in their owners|journal=Public Health Nutr|volume=13|issue= 1|pages= 1–5|year=2009|month=June|pmid=19545467|doi=10.1017/S136898000999022X|url= }}</ref> .
