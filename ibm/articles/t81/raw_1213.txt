Prevalence of [[childhood obesity]] has increased dramatically worldwide. A [[The Lancet|Lancet]] article published in 2010 that the prevalence of childhood obesity during the past two to three decades, much like the [[United States]], has increased in most other industrialized nations, excluding [[Russia]] and [[Poland]]. <ref>Han, J.

Childhood obesity Lancet 375 (9727) (May 15): 1737-48. </ref> Between the early 1970s and late 1990s, prevalence of childhood obesity doubled or tripled in [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Japan]], the [[United Kingdom|UK]], and the USA. <ref>Han, J.

The National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) has facilitated estimation of childhood obesity rates at state levels and comparison of geographic differences in social and behavioral factors. In the United States, 17% of children and [[teenager]]s in the United States are considered obese (BMI ≥95th percentile of the sex specific 2000 CDC growth charts). <ref>Obesity and overweight for professionals: Childhood: Basics | DNPAO | CDC [cited 11/26/2011 2011].

The highest rates of childhood obesity are found in the southeastern states of which [[Mississippi]] was found to have the highest rate of overweight/obese children, 44.5%/21.9% respectively. <ref>Borghi, E., M. de Onis, C.

The likelihood of obesity in children was found to increase significantly with decreasing levels of [[household income]], lower neighborhood access to parks or sidewalks, increased [[television]] viewing time, and increased recreational [[computer]] time. <ref>Obesity and overweight for professionals: Childhood: Basics | DNPAO | CDC [cited 11/26/2011 2011].
