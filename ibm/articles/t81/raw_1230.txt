{{Other uses}}[[File:Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Sport in [[childhood]]. [[Association football]], shown above, is a [[team sport]] which also provides opportunities to nurture [[physical fitness]] and [[social actions|social interaction]] skills.]] . 

'''Sport''' (or, in the [[United States]], '''sports''') is all forms of [[Competition|competitive]] [[physical activity]] which,<ref name=sportaccord>{{cite web|publisher=SportAccord|url=www.sportaccord.com/en/members/index.php?idIndex=32&idContent=14881|title=Definition of sport}}</ref> through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical fitness and provide [[entertainment]] to participants. <ref name=council>{{cite web|last=Council of Europe|title=The Europien sport charter|url=https://wcd.coe.int/wcd/ViewDoc.jsp?id=206451|accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref>  Hundreds of sports exist, from those requiring only two participants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in [[team]]s or competing as individuals.  . 

Sport is generally recognised as activities which are based in physical [[athleticism]] or physical [[dexterity]], with the largest major competitions such as the [[Olympic Games]] admitting only sports meeting this definition,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/sports|title=List of Summer and Winter Olympic Sports and Events|publisher=The Olympic Movement}}</ref> and other organisations such as the [[Council of Europe]] using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports. <ref name=council/>  However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, actvities claim recognition as [[mind sport]]s. The International Olympic Committee (through [[Association of IOC Recognised International Sports Federations|ARISF]]) recognises both [[chess]] and [[Contract bridge|bridge]] as ''bona fide'' sports, and [[SportAccord]], the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports,<ref>{{cite web|publisher=SportAccord|title=World Mind Games|url=www.sportaccord.com/en/multi-sports-games/index.php?idIndex=35&idContent=658}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=SportAccord|title=Members|url=www.sportaccord.com/en/members/index.php?idContent=644&idIndex=32}}</ref> although limits the amount of mind games which can be admitted as sports. <ref name=sportaccord/> . 

Sports are usually governed by a set of [[regulation of sport|rules]] or [[tradition|custom]]s, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner.  Winning can by determined by physical events such as scoring [[goal (sport)|goals]] or crossing a line first, or by the determination of judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.   . 

In organised sport, records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in [[sport news]]. In addition, sport is a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with [[spectator sports]] drawing large crowds to venues, and reaching wider audiences through [[sports broadcasting]].  . 

==Meaning and usage==. 
===Etymology===. 
{{Wiktionary}}
"Sport" comes from the [[French language|Old French]] ''desport'' meaning "leisure", with the oldest definition in English from around 1300 being "anything humans find amusing or entertaining". <ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=sport&searchmode=none|title= sport (n.) |accessdate= 20 April 2008|first= Douglas|last=Harper|work= Online Etymological Dictionary}}</ref> . 

The French word for sport is based on the Persian word ''bord'', meaning "winning" or "win". The Chinese term for sport, ''tiyu'' (体育; 體育) connotes physical training. The modern Greek term for sport is Αθλητισμός (''athlitismos''), directly cognate with the English terms "athlete" and "athleticism".  . 

Other meanings include gambling and events staged for the purpose of gambling; hunting; and games and diversions, including ones that require exercise. <ref>{{cite book |title= Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged|publisher= G&C Merriam Company|location= Springfield, MA|page= 2206|year= 1967 }}</ref> Roget's defines the noun sport as an "activity engaged in for relaxation and amusement" with synonyms including diversion and recreation. <ref>{{cite book |title= Roget's II: The New Thesaurus, Third Edition|publisher= Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|url= http://thesaurus.reference.com/browse/sport |year= 1995 |isbn= 0-618-25414-5}}</ref> . 

===Nomenclature===. 
The singular term 'sport' is used in most English dialects to decribe the overall concept (e.g. "children taking part in sport"), with 'sports' used to describe multiple activities (e.g. "football and rugby are the most popular sports in England").  American English uses 'sports' for both terms.  . 

===Definition===. 
[[File:Showjumping white horse.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Show Jumping]], an [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] sport]]
The precise definition of what separates a sport from other leisure activities varies between sources, with no universally agreed definition.  The closest to an international agreement on a definition is provided by [[SportAccord]], which is the association for all the largest international sports federations (including [[association football]], [[american football]], [[cycling]], [[equestrianism|equestrian sports]], [[baseball]] and more), and is therefore the ''de facto'' representative of international sport.  . 

SportAccord uses the following criteria, determining that a sport should:<ref name=sportaccord/>
* have an element of competition
* be in no way harmful to any living creature
* not rely on equipment provided by a single supplier (excluding proprietary games such as [[arena football]])
* not rely on any 'luck' element specifically designed in to the sport . 

They also recognise that sport can be primarily physical (such as [[rugby union|rugby]] or [[athletics]]), primarily mind (such as [[chess]] or [[go (game)|go]]), predominantly motorised (such as [[Formula 1]] or [[powerboating]]), primarily co-ordination (such as [[cue sports|billiard sports]]) or primarily animal supported (such as [[equestrianism|equestrian sport]]). <ref name=sportaccord/> . 

There has been an increase in the application of the term 'sport' to a wider set of non-physical challenges such as [[electronic sports]], especially due to the large scale of participation and organised competition, but these are not widely recognised by mainstream sports organisations.  . 

===Competition===. 
There are opposing views on the necessity of competition as a defining element of a sport, with almost all [[professional sport]] involving competition, and governing bodies requiring competition as a prerequisite of recognition by the IOC or SportAccord. <ref name=sportaccord/> . 

Other bodies advocate widening the definition of sport to include all physical activity.  For instance, the [[Council of Europe]] include all forms of physical exercise, including those completed just for fun.  . 

In order to widen participation, and reduce the impact of losing on less able participants, there has been an introduction of non-competitive physical activity to traditionally competitive events such as school [[sports day]]s, although moves like this are often controversial. <ref>{{cite news|last=front|first=Rebecca|publisher=The Guardian|title=A little competition|url=www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jul/17/school-sport-competitive-children-achievement-ambition|date=2011-07-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|publisher=ParentDish|title=Why parents hate school sports day|last=Scrimgeour|first=Heidi|date=2011-06-17|url=www.parentdish.co.uk/2011/06/17/why-parents-hate-school-sports-day/}}</ref> . 

==History==. 
{{Main|History of sport}}

[[File:Greek statue discus thrower 2 century aC.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] bronze reduction of [[Myron]]'s [[Discobolos]], 2nd century AD.]] . 

There are artifacts and structures that suggest that the [[China|Chinese]] engaged in sporting activities as early as [[2000 BC]]. <ref>{{cite web|url= http://chineseculture.about.com/library/weekly/aa032301a.htm| title= Sports [[History]] in China}}</ref> Gymnastics appears to have been a popular sport in China's ancient past. Monuments to the Pharaohs indicate that a number of sports, including swimming and fishing, were well-developed and regulated several thousands of years ago in ancient Egypt. <ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ioa.leeds.ac.uk/1980s/84085.htm| title= Mr Ahmed D. Touny (EGY), IOC Member}}</ref> Other Egyptian sports included javelin throwing, high jump, and wrestling. Ancient Persian sports such as the traditional [[Iran]]ian martial art of [[Zourkhaneh]] had a close connection to the warfare skills. <ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.kuwait-info.com/newsnew/NewsDetails1.asp?id=78319&dt=10/13/2006&ntype=World| title= Persian warriors}}</ref> Among other sports that originate in ancient [[Iran|Persia]] are [[polo]] and [[jousting]]. 
[[File:Bruno Senna 2006 Australian Grand Prix.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Motorsport|Motorized sports]] have appeared since the advent of the modern age]]
A wide range of sports were already established by the time of [[Ancient Greece]] and the military culture and the development of sports in Greece influenced one another considerably. Sports became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created the Olympic Games, which in ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesus]] called [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. <ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/ancient/index_uk.asp| title= Ancient Olympic Games}}</ref> . 

Sports have been increasingly organised and regulated from the time of the ancient Olympics up to the present century. Industrialisation has brought increased leisure time to the citizens of developed and developing countries, leading to more time for citizens to attend and follow spectator sports, greater participation in athletic activities, and increased accessibility. These trends continued with the advent of mass media and global communication. Professionalism became prevalent, further adding to the increase in sport's popularity, as sports fans began following the exploits of professional athletes through radio, television, and the internet—all while enjoying the exercise and competition associated with amateur participation in sports.  . 

==Fair play==. 
===Sportsmanship===. 
{{Main|Sportsmanship}}
{{See also|Gamesmanship|Winning isn't everything; it's the only thing}} . 

Sportsmanship is an attitude that strives for fair play, courtesy toward teammates and opponents, ethical behaviour and integrity, and grace in victory or defeat. <ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.merriam.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=sportsmanship| publisher= Merriam-Webster|title=Sportsmanship}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Fish|first1=Joel|last2=Magee|first2=Susan|date=2003|title=101 Ways to Be a Terrific Sports Parent|publisher=Fireside|page=168}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Lacey|first=David|date=2007-11-10|url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/11/10/it_takes_a_bad_loser_to_become.html|title=It takes a bad loser to become a good winner|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref> . 

Sportsmanship expresses an aspiration or ethos that the activity will be enjoyed for its own sake. The well-known sentiment by sports journalist [[Grantland Rice]], that it's “not that you won or lost but how you played the game", and the modern Olympic creed expressed by its founder [[Pierre de Coubertin]]: "The most important thing... is not winning but taking part" are typical expressions of this sentiment.  . 

===Cheating===. 
{{see also|Match fixing|cheating}}
Key tenets of sport include that the result should not be predetermined, and that both sides should have equal opportunity to win.  Rules are in place to ensure that fair play to occur, but participants can break these rules in order to gain advantage.  . 

Participants may choose to cheat in order to satisfy their desire to win, or in order to achieve an ulterior motive.  The widespread existence of [[gambling]] on the results of sports fixtures creates the motivation for [[match fixing]], where a participant or participants deliberately work to ensure a given outcome.  . 

===Doping and drugs===. 
{{main|Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport}}
The competitive nature of sport encourages some participants to attempt to enhance their performance through the use of medicines, or through other means such as increasing the volume of blood in their bodies through artificial means.  . 

All sports recognised by the IOC or SportAccord are required to implement a testing programme, looking for a list of banned drugs, with suspensions or bans being placed on participants who test positive for banned substances.  . 

===Violence===. 
[[Violence in sports]] involves crossing the line between fair competition and intentional aggressive violence. Athletes, coaches, fans, and parents sometimes unleash violent behaviour on people or property, in misguided shows of loyalty, dominance, anger, or celebration. [[Rioting]] or [[hooliganism]] are common and ongoing problems at national and international sporting contests.  . 

==Participation==. 
===Gender participation===. 
{{Expand section|date=March 2012}}
{{see also|Women's sports}}
Female participation continues to rise alongside the opportunity for involvement and the value of sports for [[child development]] and [[physical fitness]]. Despite gains during the last three decades, a gap persists in the enrollment figures between male and female players. Female players account for 39% of the total participation in US interscholastic athletics. Gender balance has been accelerating from a 32% increase in 1973–74 to a 63% increase in 1994–95. Hessel (2000){{Full|date=March 2011}}.  . 

===Youth participation===. 
{{expand section|date=March 2012}}
Youth sports present children with opportunities for fun, socialization, forming peer relationships, physical fitness, and [[athletic scholarship]]s. Activists for [[education]] and the [[war on drugs]] encourage youth sports as a means to increase [[Participation inequality|educational participation]] and to fight the [[illegal drug trade]]. According to the [[Nationwide Children's Hospital (Columbus)#Research and education|Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children’s Hospital]], the biggest risk for youth sports is death or serious injury including [[concussion]], with the highest risk coming from running, basketball, football, volleyball, soccer, and gymnastics. <ref>[http://healthland.time.com/2009/08/04/why-are-more-kids-getting-hurt-in-gym-class/ "Gym class injuries up 150% between 1997 and 2007"], ''Time'', 4 August 2009</ref> . 

===Spectator involvement===. 
[[File:1906 Athens stadium.jpg|thumb|right|Spectators at the 1906 unofficial Olympic Games]]
{{Main|Spectator sport}}
The competition element of sport, along with the aesthetic appeal of some sports, result in the popularity of people attending to watch sport being played.  This has led to the specific phenomenon of [[spectator sport]].  . 

Both amateur and professional sports attract spectators, both in person at the sport venue, and through broadcast mediums including [[radio broadcasting|radio]], [[television]] and [[internet]] broadcast.  Both attendance in person and viewing remotely can incur a sometimes substantial charge, such as an entrance ticket, or [[pay-per-view]] television broadcast.   . 

It is common for popular sports to attract large broadcast audiences, leading to rival broadcasters bidding large amounts of money for the rights to show certain fixtures. The football [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] attracts a global [[television]] audience of hundreds of millions; the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] [[FIFA World Cup Finals|final]] alone attracted an estimated worldwide audience of well over 700 million and the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]] attracted about 2.3 Billion worldwide viewers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} . 

In the [[United States]], the championship game of the [[National Football League|NFL]], the [[Super Bowl]], has become one of the most watched television broadcasts of the year.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Super Bowl Sunday is a ''de facto'' national holiday in America; the viewership being so great that in 2007 advertising space was reported as being sold at [[$]]2.6m for a 30 second slot.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} . 

==Issues and considerations==. 
===Amateur and professional===. 
[[File:OHL-Hockey-Plymouth-Whalers-vs-Saginaw-Spirit.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Modern sports have complex [[Regulation of sport|rule]]s and are highly organized.]]
{{See also|professional sport|amateur sport}}
Sport can be undertaken on an amateur, professional or semi-professional basis, depending on whether particpants are incentivised for participation (usually through payment of a [[wage]] or [[salary]]).   . 

The popularity of [[spectator sport]] as a recreation for non-participants has led to sport becoming a major business in its own right, and this has incentivised a high paying [[professional sport]] culture, where high performing participants are rewarded with pay far in excess of average wages, which can run in to millions of dollars. <ref>{{cite news|publisher=Sports Illustrated|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/specials/fortunate50-2011/index.html|title=Fortunate 50 2011|last=Freedman|first=Jonah}}</ref> . 

Some sports, or individual competitions within a sport, retain a policy of allowing only [[amateur sport]].  The [[Olympic Games]] started with a principle of amateur competition with those who practiced a sport professionally considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practiced it merely as a hobby. <ref name=OIdeology>{{cite book |last=Eassom |first=Simon |title=Critical Reflections on Olympic Ideology |year=1994 |location=Ontario |publisher=The Centre for Olympic Studies |pages=120&ndash;123 |isbn=0-7714-1697-0}}</ref>, but following the 1988 games, the IOC decided to make all professional athletes elgible for the Olympics, with only [[boxing]] and [[wrestling]] still competed on an "amateur" basis, although this revolves around rules, and not payment.  . 

'''Grassroots sport''' is a popular phrase which covers the amateur participation in sport at lower levels, normally without pretension towards higher achievement, and is in line with the "sport for all" mentality, where enjoyment is the primary reason for participation. <ref name="White Paper">{{cite web|last=European Commission|title=The White Paper on Sport|url=http://ec.europa.eu/sport/white-paper/index_en.htm|accessdate=11.7.2007}}</ref><ref name="council"/> . 

===Technology===. 
Technology plays an important part in modern sport, with it being a necessary part of some sports (such as motorsport), and used in others to improve performance.  . 

[[Sports science]] is a widespread academic discipline, and can be applied to areas including athlete performance, such as the use of video analysis to fine tune technique, or to equipment, such as improved [[running shoe]]s or [[competitive swimwear]].  . 

In order to control the impact of technology on fair play, governing bodies frequently have specific rules designed to control the impact of technical advantage between participants.   . 

===Politics===. 
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2010}}
{{Main|Politics and sports}} . 

Sports and politics can influence each other greatly.  . 

When [[apartheid]] was the official policy in [[South Africa]], many sports people, particularly in [[rugby union]], adopted the conscientious approach that they should not appear in competitive sports there. Some feel this was an effective contribution to the eventual demolition of the policy of apartheid, others feel that it may have prolonged and reinforced its worst effects. <ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1478-0542.2005.00165.x| title= Sport and apartheid}}</ref> . 

The [[1936 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Berlin]] was an [[illustration]], perhaps best recognised in retrospect, where an ideology was developing which used the event to strengthen its spread through propaganda.  . 

In the history of [[Ireland]], Gaelic sports were connected with [[cultural nationalism]]. Until the mid 20th century a person could have been banned from playing [[Gaelic football]], [[hurling]], or other sports administered by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) if she/he played or supported [[Association football|football]], or other games seen to be of [[Great Britain|British]] origin. Until recently the GAA continued to ban the playing of football and [[rugby union]] at Gaelic venues. This ban is still enforced, but was modified to allow football and rugby to be played in [[Croke Park]] while [[Lansdowne Road]] was redeveloped into [[Aviva Stadium]]. Until recently, under Rule 21, the GAA also banned members of the British security forces and members of the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] from playing Gaelic games, but the advent of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998 led to the eventual removal of the ban.  . 

[[Nationalism]] is often evident in the pursuit of sports, or in its reporting: people compete in national teams, or commentators and audiences can adopt a partisan view. On occasion, such tensions can lead to violent confrontation among players or spectators within and beyond the sporting venue, as in the [[Football War]]. These trends are seen by many as contrary to the fundamental ethos of sports being carried on for its own sake and for the enjoyment of its participants.  . 

A very famous case when sports and politics colided was the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Masked men entered the hotel of the Israeli olympic team and killed many of their men. This was known as the [[Munich massacre]].  .
