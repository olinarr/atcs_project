'''Childhood obesity'''  is a condition where excess [[adipose tissue|body fat]] negatively affects a child's health or wellbeing.  As methods to determine body fat directly are difficult, the diagnosis of [[obesity]] is often based on [[Body mass index|BMI]]. Due to the rising prevalence of obesity in children and its many adverse health effects it is being recognized as a serious [[public health]] concern. <ref name=Kopelman2005/>  The term overweight rather than obese is often used in children as it is less stigmatizing. <ref name="Bessesen DH 2008 2027–34">{{cite journal |author=Bessesen DH |title=Update on obesity |journal=J.

[[Body mass index]] (BMI) is acceptable for determining obesity for children two years of age and older. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Deurenberg P, Weststrate JA, Seidell JC |title=Body mass index as a measure of body fatness: age- and sex-specific prediction formulas |journal=Br.

The [[Center for Disease Control]] defines obesity as a BMI greater than or equal to the 95th percentile.  It has published tables for determining this in children. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/childrens_BMI/about_childrens_BMI.htm |title=Healthy Weight: Assessing Your Weight: BMI: About BMI for Children and Teens |work=CDC |accessdate=}}</ref> . 

== Effects on health ==.

== Causes ==. 
Childhood obesity can be brought on by a range of factors which often act in combination. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Ebbeling CB, Pawlak DB, Ludwig DS |title=Childhood obesity: public-health crisis, common sense cure |journal=Lancet |volume=360 |issue=9331 |pages=473–82 |year=2002 |pmid=12241736 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)09678-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Dietz WH |title=Health consequences of obesity in youth: childhood predictors of adult disease |journal=Pediatrics |volume=101 |issue=3 Pt 2 |pages=518–25 |year=1998 |pmid=12224658 |doi=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Speiser PW, Rudolf MC, Anhalt H, ''et al.'' |title=Childhood obesity |journal=J.

Retrieved December 1, 2011, from http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/14548/1/14548.pdf</ref> . 

== Prevention ==. 
"Obesity of mothers predisposes their offsprings to obesity by epigenetic, prenatal effects." Prevention and awareness programs should target children as early as kindergarten with the involvement of parents. The approaches include changing the environment children are in. For example, the banning of pop being sold at vending machines in school. <ref>{{cite journal | author = Reinehr T, Wabitsch M | title = Childhood Obesity | journal = Current Opinion in Lipidology | volume =22 | issue = 1 | year = 2011 | pages = 21–25 | doi = 10.1097/MOL.0b013e32833f9c37 | pmid = 20871401}}</ref> . 

=== Dietary ===. 
The effects of eating habits on childhood obesity are difficult to determine.  A three year randomized controlled study of 1,704 3rd grade children which provided two healthy meals a day in combination with an exercise program and dietary counsellings failed to show a significant reduction in percentage body fat when compared to a [[Experimental control|control group]].  This was partly due to the fact that even though the children believed they were eating less their actual calorie consumption did not decrease with the intervention.  At the same time observed energy expenditure remained similar between the groups.  This occurred even though dietary fat intake decreased from 34% to 27%. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Caballero B, Clay T, Davis SM, ''et al.'' |title=Pathways: a school-based, randomized controlled trial for the prevention of obesity in American Indian schoolchildren |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=78 |issue=5 |pages=1030–8 |year=2003 |month=November |pmid=14594792 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14594792}}</ref>  A second study of 5,106 children showed similar results.  Even though the children ate an improved diet there was no effect found on BMI. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Nader PR, Stone EJ, Lytle LA, ''et al.'' |title=Three-year maintenance of improved diet and physical activity: the CATCH cohort. Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health |journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med |volume=153 |issue=7 |pages=695–704 |year=1999 |month=July |pmid=10401802 |url=http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10401802 |doi=10.1001/archpedi.153.7.695}}</ref>  Why these studies did not bring about the desired effect of curbing childhood obesity has been attributed to the interventions not being sufficient enough.  Changes were made primarily in the school environment while it is felt that they must occur in the home, the community, and the school simultaneously to have a significant effect. <ref name=Kolata2007>{{cite book |author=Kolata G |title=Rethinking Thin: The new science of weight loss — and the myths and realities of dieting |publisher=Picador |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-312-42785-6}}</ref> . 

Calorie-rich drinks and foods are readily available to children.  Consumption of sugar-laden [[soft drink]]s may contribute to childhood obesity. In a study of 548 children over a 19 month period the likelihood of obesity increased 1.6 times for every additional soft drink consumed per day. <ref>{{cite journal |author=James J, Kerr D |title=Prevention of childhood obesity by reducing soft drinks |journal=Int J Obes (Lond) |volume=29 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=S54–7 |year=2005 |pmid=16385753 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijo.0803062}}</ref> . 

Calorie-dense, prepared snacks are available in many locations frequented by children.  As childhood obesity has become more prevalent, snack vending machines in school settings have been reduced by law in a small number of localities.  Eating at [[fast food]] restaurants is very common among young people with 75% of 7th to 12th grade students consuming fast food in a given week. <ref>{{cite journal |author=French SA, Story M, Neumark-Sztainer D, Fulkerson JA, Hannan P |title=Fast food restaurant use among adolescents: associations with nutrient intake, food choices and behavioral and psychosocial variables |journal=Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. |volume=25 |issue=12 |pages=1823–33 |year=2001 |pmid=11781764 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijo.0801820}}</ref>  The fast food industry is also at fault for the rise in childhood obesity. This industry spends about $4.2 billion on advertisements aimed at young children. McDonald's alone has thirteen websites that are viewed by 365,000 children and 294,000 teenagers each month. In addition, fast food restaurants give out toys in children's meals, which helps to entice children. Forty percent of children ask their parents to take them to fast food restaurants on a daily basis. To make matters worse, out of 3000 combinations created from popular items on children's menus at fast food restaurants, only 13 meet the recommended nutritional guidelines for young children. <ref>Tracy, Ben.

[[Milk|Whole milk]] consumption verses 2% milk consumption in children of one to two years of age had no effect on weight, height, or [[body fat percentage]].  Therefore, whole milk continues to be recommended for this [[Demographic profile|age group]].  However the trend of substituting sweetened drink for milk has been found to lead to excess weight gain. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Allen RE, Myers AL |title=Nutrition in toddlers |journal=American Family Physician |volume=74 |issue=9 |pages=1527–32 |year=2006 |month=November |pmid=17111891 }}</ref> . 

=== Sedentary lifestyle ===. 
Physical inactivity of children has also shown to be a serious cause, and children who fail to engage in regular physical activity are at greater risk of obesity. Researchers studied the [[physical activity]] of 133 children over a three week period using an [[accelerometer]] to measure each child's level of physical activity. They discovered the obese children were 35% less active on school days and 65% less active on weekends compared to non-obese children.  . 

Physical inactivity as a child could result in physical inactivity as an adult. In a fitness survey of 6,000 adults, researchers discovered that 25% of those who were considered active at ages 14 to 19 were also active adults, compared to 2% of those who were inactive at ages 14 to 19, who were now said to be active adults. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Ortega FB, Ruiz JR, Castillo MJ, Sjöström M |title=Physical fitness in childhood and adolescence: a powerful marker of health |journal=Int J Obes (Lond) |volume=23 |issue= 1 |pages=1–11 |year=2007 |pmid=18043605 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijo.0803774}}</ref> Staying physically inactive leaves unused energy in the body, most of which is stored as [[fat]]. Researchers studied 16 men over a 14 day period and fed them 50% more of their energy required every day through fats and [[carbohydrates]]. They discovered that carbohydrate overfeeding produced 75–85% excess energy being stored as [[body fat]] and fat overfeeding produced 90–95% storage of excess energy as body fat. <ref name="pmid7598063">{{cite journal |author=Horton TJ, Drougas H, Brachey A, Reed GW, Peters JC, Hill JO |title=Fat and carbohydrate overfeeding in humans: different effects on energy storage |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=19–29 |year=1995 |pmid=7598063 }}</ref> . 

Many children fail to exercise because they are spending time doing stationary activities such as computer usage, playing video games or watching television. TV and other technology may be large factors of physically inactive children. Researchers provided a technology questionnaire to 4,561 children, ages 14, 16, and 18. They discovered  children were 21.5% more likely to be overweight when watching 4+ hours of TV per day, 4.5% more likely to be overweight when using a [[computer]] one or more hours per day, and unaffected by potential weight gain from playing [[video games]]. <ref name="pmid7598063"/> A [[randomized trial]] showed that reducing TV viewing and computer use can decrease age-adjusted BMI; [[Diet food|reduced calorie]] intake was thought to be the greatest contributor to the BMI decrease. <ref name="pmid18316661">{{cite journal |author=Epstein LH, Roemmich JN, Robinson JL, ''et al.'' |title=A randomized trial of the effects of reducing television viewing and computer use on body mass index in young children |journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med |volume=162 |issue=3 |pages=239–45 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18316661 |pmc=2291289 |doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2007.45 |url=http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18316661}}</ref> . 

Technological activities are not the only household influences of childhood obesity. [[Poverty|Low-income]] households can affect a child's tendency to gain weight. Over a three week period researchers studied the relationship of [[socioeconomic status]] (SES) to [[body composition]] in 194 children, ages 11–12. They measured weight, waist girth, stretch stature, skinfolds, physical activity, TV viewing, and SES; researchers discovered clear SES inclines to [[upper class]] children compared to the [[lower class]] children. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Lluch A, Herbeth B, Méjean L, Siest G |title=Dietary intakes, eating style and overweight in the Stanislas Family Study |journal=Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. |volume=24 |issue=11 |pages=1493–9 |year=2000 |pmid=11126347 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijo.0801425|url=http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v24/n11/full/0801425a.html}}</ref> . 

Childhood inactivity is linked to [[obesity]] in the [[United States]] with more children being [[overweight]] at younger ages. In a 2009 preschool study 89% of a preschoolers' day was found to be sedentary while the same study also found that even when outside, 56 percent of activities were still sedentary. One factor believed to contribute to the lack of activity found was little teacher motivation,<ref name="Inactivity"/> but when [[toy]]s, such as [[ball]]s were made available, the children were more likely to play. <ref name="Inactivity">{{cite web|  title = The Inactivity Of Preschoolers Amid Rising Childhood Obesity

=== Genetics ===. 
Childhood obesity is often the result of an interplay between many genetic and [[environmental factor]]s. [[Polymorphism (biology)|Polymorphisms]] in various [[gene]]s controlling [[appetite]] and [[metabolism]] predispose individuals to obesity when sufficient calories are present. As such obesity is a major feature of a number of rare genetic conditions that often present in childhood.  . 

* [[Prader-Willi syndrome]] with an incidence between 1 in 12,000 and 1 in 15,000 live births is characterized by hyperphagia and food preoccupations which leads to rapid weight gain in those affected. 
* [[Bardet-Biedl syndrome]]
* [[MOMO syndrome]]
* [[Leptin receptor]] mutations
* [[Congenital leptin deficiency]]
* [[Melanocortin receptor]] mutations . 

In children with early-onset severe obesity (defined by an onset before ten years of age and body mass index over three [[standard deviation]]s above normal), 7% harbor a single locus mutation. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Farooqi S, O'Rahilly S |title=Genetics of obesity in humans |journal=Endocr. Rev. |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=710–18 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17122358 |doi=10.1210/er.2006-0040 |url=http://edrv.endojournals.org/cgi/content/full/27/7/710}}</ref>  One study found that 80% of the offspring of two obese parents were obese in contrast to less than 10% of the offspring of two parents who were of normal weight. <ref name=Kopelman2005>{{cite book|author=Kopelman, Peter G|title=Clinical obesity in adults and children: In Adults and Children|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location= |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-4051-1672-5|url=http://books.google.com/?id=u7RvldSr5M0C&pg=PA87&dq=80+percent+of+the+offspring+of+two+obese+parents+become+obese|page=493}}</ref><ref name=Kolata2007/>  The percentage of obesity that can be attributed to genetics varies from 6% to 85% depending on the population examined. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Yang W, Kelly T, He J |title=Genetic epidemiology of obesity |journal=Epidemiol Rev |volume=29 |pages=49–61 |year=2007 |pmid=17566051 |doi=10.1093/epirev/mxm004 }}</ref> . 

=== Home environment ===. 
Children's food choices are also influenced by family meals. Researchers provided a [[household]] eating questionnaire to 18,177 children, ranging in ages 11–21, and discovered that four out of five parents let their children make their own food decisions. They also discovered that compared to adolescents who ate three or fewer meals per week, those who ate four to five family meals per week were 19% less likely to report poor consumption of [[vegetables]], 22% less likely to report poor consumption of fruits, and 19% less likely to report poor consumption of [[dairy product|dairy foods]]. Adolescents who ate six to seven family meals per week, compared to those who ate three or fewer family meals per week, were 38% less likely to report poor consumption of vegetables, 31% less likely to report poor consumption of fruits, and 27% less likely to report poor consumption of dairy foods. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Videon TM, Manning CK |title=Influences on adolescent eating patterns: the importance of family meals |journal=J Adolesc Health |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=365–73 |year=2003 |pmid=12729986 |doi=10.1016/S1054-139X(02)00711-5}}</ref> The results of a survey in the UK published in 2010 imply that children raised by their grandparents are more likely to be obese as adults than those raised by their parents. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8513112.stm | work=BBC News | title=Grandparents 'boost obesity risk' | date=2010-02-15 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref> An American study released in 2011 found the more mothers work the more children are more likely to be overweight or obese. <ref>{{cite news|title=Childhood obesity risk tied to amount of work mother does lineup announced |url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/wellbeing/kids-of-working-mums-fatter-study-20110208-1al0g.html |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |date=8 February 2011 |accessdate=8 February 2011}}</ref> . 

=== Developmental factors ===. 
Various [[Child development|developmental]] factors may affects rates of obesity. [[Breastfeeding|Breast-feeding]] for example may protect against obesity in later life with the duration of breast-feeding inversely associated with the risk of being overweight later on. <ref name=naspghan2008>{{cite web|title=North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition|url=http://www.naspghan.org/user-assets/Documents/pdf/WG%20Reports%202008/obesity.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> A child's body growth pattern may influence the tendency to gain weight. Researchers measured the [[standard deviation]] (SD [weight and length]) scores in a [[cohort study]] of 848 babies. They found that infants who had an SD score above 0.67 had catch up growth (they were less likely to be overweight) compared to infants who had less than a 0.67 SD score (they were more likely to gain weight). <ref>{{cite journal |author=Ong KK, Ahmed ML, Emmett PM, ''et al''|title=Association between postnatal catch-up growth and obesity in childhood: prospective cohort study |journal=BMJ |volume=320 |issue=7240 |pages=967–71 |year=2000 |pmid=10753147 |doi=10.1136/bmj.320.7240.967 |pmc=27335}}</ref> . 

A child's weight may be influenced when he/she is only an [[infant]]. Researchers did a cohort study on 19,397 [[babies]], from their birth until age seven and discovered that fat babies at four months were 1.38 times more likely to be overweight at seven years old compared to normal weight babies. Fat babies at the age of one were 1.17 times more likely to be overweight at age seven compared to normal weight babies. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Stettler N, Zemel BS, Kumanyika S, Stallings VA |title=Infant weight gain and childhood overweight status in a multicenter, cohort study |journal=Pediatrics |volume=109 |issue=2 |pages=194–9 |year=2002 |pmid=11826195 |doi=10.1542/peds.109.2.194}}</ref> . 

=== Medical illness === . 

[[Cushing's syndrome]] (a condition in which the body contains excess amounts of [[cortisol]]) may also influence childhood obesity. Researchers analyzed two [[isoforms]] ([[proteins]] that have the same purpose as other proteins, but are programmed by different [[genes]]) in the [[cell (biology)|cells]] of 16 adults undergoing [[abdominal surgery]]. They discovered that one type of isoform created oxo-[[reductase]] activity (the alteration of [[cortisone]] to cortisol) and this activity increased 127.5 pmol mg sup when the other type of isoform was treated with cortisol and [[insulin]]. The activity of the cortisol and insulin can possibly activate Cushing's syndrome. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Bujalska IJ, Kumar S, Stewart PM |title=Does central obesity reflect "Cushing's disease of the omentum"? |journal=Lancet |volume=349 |issue=9060 |pages=1210–3 |year=1997 |pmid=9130942 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(96)11222-8}}</ref> . 

[[Hypothyroidism]] is a [[hormonal]] cause of obesity, but it does not significantly affect obese people who have it more than obese people who do not have it. In a comparison of 108 obese patients with hypothyroidism to 131 obese patients without hypothyroidism, researchers discovered that those with hypothyroidism had only 0.077 points more on the caloric intake scale than did those without hypothyroidism. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Tagliaferri M, Berselli ME, Calò G, ''et al.'' |title=Subclinical hypothyroidism in obese patients: relation to resting energy expenditure, serum leptin, body composition, and lipid profile |journal=Obes. Res. |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=196–201 |year=2001 |pmid=11323445 |doi=10.1038/oby.2001.21}}</ref> . 

=== Psychological factors ===. 
Researchers surveyed 1,520 children, ages 9–10, with a four year follow up and discovered a [[Correlation|positive correlation]] between obesity and low [[self esteem]] in the four year follow up. They also discovered that decreased self esteem led to 19% of obese children feeling sad, 48% of them feeling bored, and 21% of them feeling nervous. In comparison, 8% of normal weight children felt sad, 42% of them felt bored, and 12% of them felt nervous. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Strauss RS |title=Childhood obesity and self-esteem |journal=Pediatrics |volume=105 |issue=1 |pages=e15 |year=2000 |pmid=10617752 |doi=10.1542/peds.105.1.e15}}</ref> [[Stress (medicine)|Stress]] can influence a child's eating habits. Researchers tested the stress inventory of 28 college females and discovered that those who were [[binge eating]] had a mean of 29.65 points on the perceived stress scale, compared to the control group who had a mean of 15.19 points. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Ogg EC, Millar HR, Pusztai EE, Thom AS |title=General practice consultation patterns preceding diagnosis of eating disorders |journal=Int J Eat Disord |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=89–93 |year=1997 |pmid=9140741 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-108X(199707)22:1<89::AID-EAT12>3.0.CO;2-D}}</ref> This evidence may demonstrate a link between eating and stress.  . 

Feelings of depression can cause a child to overeat. Researchers provided an in-home interview to 9,374 adolescents, in grades seven through 12 and discovered that there was not a direct correlation with children eating in response to depression. Of all the obese adolescents, 8.2% had said to be depressed, compared to 8.9% of the non-obese adolescents who said they were depressed. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Goodman E, Whitaker RC |title=A prospective study of the role of depression in the development and persistence of adolescent obesity |journal=Pediatrics |volume=110 |issue=3 |pages=497–504 |year=2002 |pmid=12205250 |doi=10.1542/peds.110.3.497}}</ref> [[Antidepressants]], however, seem to have very little influence on childhood obesity. Researchers provided a depression questionnaire to 487 overweight/obese subjects and found that 7% of those with low depression symptoms were using antidepressants and had an average BMI score of 44.3, 27% of those with moderate depression symptoms were using antidepressants and had an average BMI score of 44.7, and 31% of those with [[Clinical depression|major depression]] symptoms were using antidepressants and had an average BMI score of 44.2. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Dixon JB, Dixon ME, O'Brien PE |title=Depression in association with severe obesity: changes with weight loss |journal=Arch.

== Management ==. 
=== Lifestyle ===. 
Exclusive breast-feeding is recommended in all newborn infants for its nutritional and other beneficial effects. It may also protect against obesity in later life. <ref name=naspghan2008/> . 

=== Medications ===. 
There are no medications currently approved for the treatment of obesity in children. [[Orlistat]] and [[sibutramine]] may however be helpful in managing moderate obesity in adolescence. <ref name=naspghan2008/>  Sibutramine is approved for adolescents older than 16.  It works by altering the brain's chemistry and decreasing appetite. Orlistat is approved for adolescents older than 12.  It works by preventing the absorption of fat in the intestines. <ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/childhood-obesity/DS00698/DSECTION=7 Childhood obesity: Treatments and drugs - MayoClinic.com]</ref> .

[[File:Figures1.gif|thumb|Prevalence of overweight among children 2 to 19 years in the USA.]]
Rates of childhood obesity have increased greatly between 1980 and 2010. <ref name=Lancet2010>{{cite journal |author=Han JC, Lawlor DA, Kimm SY |title=Childhood obesity |journal=Lancet |volume=375 |issue=9727 |pages=1737–48 |year=2010 |month=May |pmid=20451244 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60171-7 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(10)60171-7 |pmc=3073855}}</ref> Currently 10% of children worldwide are either overweight or obese. <ref name="Bessesen DH 2008 2027–34"/> . 

=== Canada === . 

The rate of overweight and obesity among Canadian children has increased dramatically in recent years.  In boys, the rate increased from 11% in 1980s to 30% in 1990s. <ref name=Flynn2006>{{cite journal |author=Flynn MA, McNeil DA, Maloff B, ''et al.'' |title=Reducing obesity and related chronic disease risk in children and youth: a synthesis of evidence with 'best practice' recommendations |journal=Obes Rev |volume=7 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=7–66 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16371076 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-789X.2006.00242.x }}</ref> . 

=== Brazil === . 

The rate of overweight and obesity in Brazilian children increased from 4% in the 1980s to 14% in the 1990s. <ref name=Flynn2006/> . 

=== United States === . 

The rate of obesity among children and adolescents in the United States has nearly tripled between the early 1980s and 2000.  It has however not changed significantly between 2000 and 2006 with the most recent statistics showing a level just over 17 percent. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Ogden CL, Carroll MD, Flegal KM |title=High body mass index for age among US children and adolescents, 2003–2006 |journal=JAMA |volume=299 |issue=20 |pages=2401–5 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18505949 |doi=10.1001/jama.299.20.2401 }}</ref>  In 2008, the rate of overweight and obese children in the United States was 32%, and had stopped climbing. <ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90880182 U.S. Childhood Obesity Rates Level Off]</ref> In 2011, a national cohort study of infants and toddlers found that nearly one-third of US children were overweight or obese at 9 months and 2 years old. <ref>{{cite journal | author=Moss BG, Yeaton WH | title =Young Children's Weight Trajectories and Associated Risk Factors: Results From the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study–Birth Cohort.| journal= American Journal of Health Promotion| year= 2011 |volume= 25| issue=3| pages= 190–198|doi= 10.4278/ajhp.090123-QUAN-29 | pmid=21192749}}</ref> . 

=== Australia ===. 
Since the onset of the 21st Century, Australia has found that childhood obesity has followed trend with the United States. Information garnered has concluded that the increase has occurred in the lower socioeconomic areas where poor nutritional education has been blamed.  . 

== Research ==. 
A study of 1800 children aged 2 to 12 in [[Colac, Victoria|Colac]], [[Australia]] tested a program of restricted diet (no carbonated drinks or sweets) and increased exercise. Interim results included a 68% increase in [[After School Activity|after school activity programs]], 21% reduction in television viewing, and an average of 1&nbsp;kg weight reduction compared to a control group. <ref>"[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/obesity-study-bears-fruit/2006/08/24/1156012648038.html Obesity study bears fruit]", ''[[Jamie Oliver]]'', 24 August 2006. </ref> . 

A survey carried out by the [[American Obesity Association]] into parental attitudes towards their children's weight showed the majority of parents think that recess should not be reduced or replaced. Almost 30% said that they were concerned with their child's weight. 35% of parents thought that their child's school was not teaching them enough about childhood obesity, and over 5% thought that childhood obesity was the greatest risk to their child's long term health. <ref>[http://www.obesity.org/research/parent_survey.shtml Survey on parents' perceptions of their children's weight], [[American Obesity Association]].  August, 2000. Retrieved 2006-11-21. </ref> . 

A [[Northwestern University]] study indicates that [[Sleep deprivation|inadequate sleep]] has a negative impact on a child's performance in school, their emotional and social welfare, and increases their risk of being overweight. This study was the first nationally represented, longitudinal investigation of the correlation between sleep, Body Mass Index (BMI) and overweight status in children between the ages of 3 and 18. The study found that an extra hour of sleep lowered the children's risk of being overweight from 36% to 30%, while it lessened older children's risk from 34% to 30%. <ref>{{cite journal | author= Snell E, Adam EK, Duncan GJ | date = January/February | year = 2007 | title = Sleep and the Body Mass Index and Overweight Status of Children and Adolescents | journal = Child Development | pages=309–23 |publisher = Society for Research in Child Development's | volume = 78 | issue = 1 | pmid = 17328707 |doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.00999.x}}</ref> . 

Obese children and adolescents are more likely to become obese as adults. For example, one study found that approximately 80% of children who were overweight at aged 10–15 years were obese adults at age 25 years. Another study found that 25% of obese adults were overweight as children. The latter study also found that if overweight begins before 8 years of age, obesity in adulthood is likely to be more severe. <ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/childhood/index.html Childhood Overweight and Obesity], [[The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]. March, 2011. Retrieved 4/18/2011. </ref> . 

A study has also found that tackling childhood obesity will not necessarily lead to eating disorders later in life. <ref>{{cite news|title=How To Deal With Overweight/Obese Children|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/wellbeing/chewing-the-fat-20101019-16s2d.html |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |date=19 October 2010 |accessdate=20 October 2010}}</ref> .
