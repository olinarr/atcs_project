'''Homeland security''' is an [[umbrella term]] for security efforts to protect [[Sovereign state|states]] against terrorist activity.{{cn|date=March 2012}} Specifically, is a concerted national effort to prevent terrorist attacks within the U.S., reduce America’s vulnerability to terrorism, and minimize the damage and recover from attacks that do occur. <ref name=home>[http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/usaf/afdd2-10.pdf FAS.ORG: ''Air Force Doctrine Document 2-10'', 21 March 2006, pp.9-10, defines both terminologies.]<br> This document complements related discussion found in Joint Publication 3-26, (JP 3-26), Joint Doctrine for Homeland Security. </ref> . 

The term arose following a reorganization of many U.S. government agencies in 2003 to form the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] after the [[September 11 attacks]], and may be used to refer to the actions of that department, the [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs]], or the [[United States House Committee on Homeland Security|United States House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security]].  . 

[[Homeland defense]] (HD) is the protection of U.S. territory, sovereignty, domestic population, and critical infrastructure against external threats and aggression. (Definition will be incorporated into JP 3-26[1] upon its approval).[2] Not to be confused with Homeland security. <ref name=home/> . 

==In the United States==. 
In the United States, the concept of "Homeland Security" extends and recombines responsibilities of government agencies and entities. According to Homeland security research, the U.S. federal Homeland Security and [[Homeland defense|Homeland Defense]] includes 187 federal agencies and departments,<ref>[http://www.homelandsecurityresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/US-HLS-HLD-Structure-2010.pdf HomeLandSecurityResearch.com: ''Homeland Security and Defense Structure'']</ref> including the [[United States National Guard]], the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]], the [[United States Coast Guard]], [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]], [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]], [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]], the [[United States Secret Service]], the [[Transportation Security Administration]], the 14 agencies that constitute the U.S. intelligence community and [[Civil Air Patrol]]. Although many businesses now operate in the area of homeland security, it is overwhelmingly a government function. <ref>{{cite book|title=Public Administration: The Central Discipline in Homeland Security in ''The Future of Public Administration Around the World: The Minnowbrook Perspective''|year=2010|publisher=Georgetown University Press|pages=67-78|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kTdK6SUAd8QC&lpg=PA67&ots=vtvqjk74xk&dq=austen%20givens%20homeland%20security&pg=PA67#v=onepage&q&f=false|authorlink=Public Administration: The Central Discipline in Homeland Security|author=Dale Jones and Austen Givens|editor=O'Leary, Rosemary; Van Slyke, David; Kim, Soonhee}}</ref>  . 

The [[George W. Bush]] administration consolidated many of these activities under the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS), a new cabinet department established as a result of the [[Homeland Security Act]] of 2002.  However, much of the nation's homeland security activity remains outside of DHS; for example, the [[FBI]] and [[CIA]] are not part of the Department, and other executive departments such as the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and [[Department of Health and Human Services]] play a significant role in certain aspects of homeland security.  Homeland security is coordinated at the White House by the [[Homeland Security Council]], currently headed by [[John O. Brennan|John Brennan]].  . 

Homeland security is officially defined by the National Strategy for Homeland Security as "a concerted national effort to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, reduce America's vulnerability to terrorism, and minimize the damage and recover from attacks that do occur". <ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/book/index.html The National Strategy For Homeland Security<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Because the U.S. [[Department of Homeland Security]] includes the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]], it also has responsibility for preparedness, response, and recovery to natural disasters.  . 

According to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget<ref>U.S. Office of Management and Budget. Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2011. ISBN number: 978-0-16-084798-1</ref> and Homeland Security Research Corporation, DHS Homeland security funding constitutes only 20-21% of the consolidated U.S. Homeland Security - Homeland Defense funding,<ref>Homeland Security Research Corporation. U.S. HLS-HLD Markets – 2011-2014</ref> while approximately 40% of the DHS budget funds civil, non-security activities, such as the U.S. coast guard search and rescue operations and customs functions. The U.S. Homeland Security is the world largest Homeland counter terror organization, having 40% of the global FY 2010 homeland security funding. <ref>Homeland Security Research Corporation. Global Homeland Security, Homeland Defense & Intelligence Markets Outlook - 2009-2018</ref> . 

The term became prominent in the [[United States]] following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]; it had been used only in limited policy circles prior to these attacks. The phrase "security of the American homeland" appears in the 1998 report ''[http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/visions/publication/terrorism.htm Catastrophic Terrorism: Elements of a National Policy]'' by [[Ashton Carter|Ashton B. Carter]], [[John M. Deutch]], and [[Philip D. Zelikow]].  . 

Homeland security is also usually used to connote the civilian aspect of this effort; "homeland defense" refers to its military component, led chiefly by the [[United States Northern Command|U.S. Northern Command]] headquartered in [[Colorado Springs]], [[Colorado]].  . 

The scope of homeland security includes:
* Emergency preparedness and response (for both terrorism and natural disasters), including volunteer medical, [[police]], [[emergency management]], and [[fire department|fire]] personnel;
* Domestic and International intelligence activities, largely today within the [[FBI]];
* Critical infrastructure and perimeter protection;
* [[Border control|Border security]], including both land, maritime and country borders;
* Transportation security, including aviation and maritime transportation;
* [[Biodefense]];
* Detection of [[radioactive]] and [[radiological]] materials;
* Research on next-generation security technologies.  . 

===Criticism===. 
Conflicts exist between bodies of [[international law]] (ratified by the United States or not) and those applied under "homeland security". One example is the notion of an [[unlawful combatant]]. <ref>Human Rights Brief: A Legal Resource for the International Human Rights Community http://www.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/09/3guantanamo.cfm</ref> The United States government has created a new status that addresses prisoners captured by a military force who do not conform with the conditions of the Convention. While the United States has only been a signatory to portions of the [[Geneva Conventions]],<ref>[[List of parties to the Geneva Conventions]]</ref> much international law is based upon it.  .
