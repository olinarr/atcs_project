The logs contain numerous reports of previously unknown or unconfirmed events that took place during the war. 
* According to the [[Iraq Body Count project]], a sample of the deaths found in about 800 logs, extrapolated to the full set of records, shows around 15,000 civilian deaths that had not been previously admitted by the US government. 66,000 civilians were reported dead in the logs, out of 109,000 deaths in total. <ref name="wired"/><ref name="Iraq Body Count project">{{cite web |url=http://www.iraqbodycount.org/analysis/numbers/warlogs/ |title=Iraq War Logs: What the numbers reveal |publisher=[[Iraq Body Count project]] |accessdate=23 October 2010}}</ref>
* ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated that the logs show "US authorities failed to investigate hundreds of reports of abuse, torture, rape and even murder by Iraqi police and soldiers"; the coalition, according to ''The Guardian'', has "a formal policy of ignoring such allegations", unless the allegations involve coalition forces. <ref name="guardian"/>
* Sometimes US troops classified civilian deaths as enemy casualties. For example, the [[July 12, 2007, Baghdad airstrike]] by US helicopter gunships which killed two [[Reuters]] journalists along with several men thought to be armed suspected to be insurgents. They, including the journalists, were all listed as "enemy killed in action". <ref name="guardian"/>
* ''[[Wired Magazine]]'' said that even after the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse incident]] came to light in 2004, abuse of prisoners or detainees by Iraqi security forces continued; in one recorded case, US troops confiscated a "hand cranked generator with wire clamps" from a Baghdad police station, after a detainee claimed to have been brutalized there. <ref name="wired"/>
* One report analyzed by the [[Bureau of Investigative Journalism]] seems to show that "the US military cleared an [[Boeing AH-64 Apache|Apache]] helicopter gunship to open fire on Iraqi insurgents who were trying to surrender". <ref>{{cite news |title=US Apache guns down surrendering insurgents |first=Angus |last=Stickler |work=iraqwarlogs.com |publisher=[[Bureau of Investigative Journalism]] |date=22 October 2010 |url=http://www.iraqwarlogs.com/2010/10/22/us-commits-%E2%80%9Cwar-crime%E2%80%9D-as-apache-helicopter-cleared-to-gun-surrendering-insurgents/ |accessdate=23 October 2010}}</ref>
* According to ''[[Wired Magazine]]'', "WikiLeaks may have just bolstered one of the Bush administration’s most controversial claims about the Iraq war: that Iran supplied many of the Iraq insurgency’s deadliest weapons and worked hand-in-glove with some of its most lethal militias. The documents indicate that Iran was a major combatant in the Iraq war, as its elite [[Quds Force]] trained Iraqi Shiite insurgents and imported deadly weapons like the shape-charged [[explosively formed penetrator]] bombs into Iraq for use against civilians, Sunni militants and U.S. troops."<ref name="wired"/>
* It was reported in the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' that the documents show Iraqi operatives being trained by [[Hezbollah]] in precision military-style kidnappings. Reports also include incidents of US surveillance aircraft lost deep in Iranian territory. <ref>{{cite news |title=Leaks shine light on Iran’s role as backer of Iraq’s Shi’ite militias |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=23 October 2010 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2010/10/23/leaks_shine_light_on_irans_role_as_backer_of_iraqs_shiite_militias/ |accessdate=23 October 2010 |first1=Michael R. |last1=Gordon |first2=Andrew W. |last2=Lehren}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title='Hizbullah trained Iraqis how to kidnap soldiers' |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=23 October 2010 |url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=192465 |accessdate=23 October 2010}}</ref>
* A number of the documents, as defined by ''[[Al Jazeera English]]'', describe how US troops killed almost 700 civilians for coming too close to checkpoints, including pregnant women and the mentally ill. At least a half-dozen incidents involved Iraqi men transporting pregnant family members to hospitals. <ref>{{cite news |title=Iraq files reveal checkpoint deaths |first=Gregg |last=Carlstrom |newspaper=[[Al Jazeera English]] |date=23 October 2010 |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/secretiraqfiles/2010/10/2010102216241633174.html |accessdate=23 October 2010}}</ref>
* ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the reports contain evidence of many abuses, including civilian deaths, committed by contractors. ''The New York Times'' points out some specific reports, such as one which says "after the IED strike a witness reports the [[Blackwater Worldwide|Blackwater]] employees fired indiscriminately at the scene."<ref name="ny times contractors"/> In another event on 14 May 2005, an American unit "observed a Blackwater PSD shoot up a civ vehicle" killing a father and wounding his wife and daughter. <ref name="ny times contractors">{{cite news |title=Use of Contractors Added to War’s Chaos in Iraq |first1=James |last1=Glanz |first2=Andrew |last2=Lehren |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=23 October 2010 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/world/middleeast/24contractors.html?_r=1&hp |accessdate=23 October 2010}}</ref>
* A document from December 2006, as defined by ''[[The Australian]]'', describes a plan by a Shia militia commander to kidnap US soldiers in Baghdad in late 2006 or early 2007." Also, The Australian reports that "detainee testimony" and "a captured militant's diary" are cited among the documents, in order to demonstrate "how Iran provided Iraqi militias with weapons such as rockets and lethal roadside bombs."<ref>{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks confirms influences on Iraq |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |date=25 October 2010 |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/wikileaks-confirms-influences-on-iraq/story-e6frg6so-1225942950352 |accessdate=24 October 2010 |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=January 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>
* According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', a number of the documents "portrays the long history of tensions between Kurds and Arabs in the north of Iraq and reveals the fears of some American units about what might happen after American troops leave the country by the end of 2011."<ref>{{cite news |title=Tensions High Along Kurdish-Arab Line |first=Michael R. |last=Gordon |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=23 October 2010 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/world/middleeast/24kurds.html?partner=rss&emc=rss |accessdate=25 October 2010}}</ref>
* According to ''[[Dagbladet Information]]'', which has been looking through the documents for information on the actions of soldiers from Denmark in Iraq, Danish soldiers "passed on responsibility for a much higher number of prisoners to Iraqi police than has previously been made public. The practice continued even though the coalition witnessed, and was continually warned of widespread torture and mistreatment of prisoners in the hands of the Iraqi police."<ref>{{cite news |title=Danish forces involved in giving over detainees to abusive police |first=Sebastian |last=Gjerding |newspaper=[[Dagbladet Information]] |date=23 October 2010 |url=http://www.information.dk/248544 |accessdate=28 October 2010}}</ref>
* An analysis published by ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' argues the leaked documents indicates a double standard in the international community views of human rights towards Israel's military policy:<ref>{{cite news |title=Analysis: Lies, leaks, death tolls & statistics |first=Yaakov |last=Katz |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=29 October 2010 |url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=193196 |accessdate=31 October 2010}}</ref>

* According to an editorial in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the leak "mainly demonstrates that the truth about Iraq "already has been told", while it "has at least temporarily complicated negotiations to form a new government".  The editor also charged that "claims such as those published by the British journal The Lancet that American forces slaughtered hundreds of thousands are the real 'attack on truth.'"<ref>{{cite news |title=Wikileaks's leaks mostly confirm earlier Iraq reporting | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=26 October 2010 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/25/AR2010102504643.html |accessdate=1 November 2010}}</ref> . 

After criticism over the Afghan War documents leak, more material, including certain names and details, were redacted from these documents by WikiLeaks. <ref>{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks redacted more information in latest documents release |first=Larry |last=Shaughnessy |newspaper=[[CNN]] |date=23 October 2010 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/US/10/22/wikileaks.editing/ |accessdate=25 October 2010}}</ref> .

==Media coverage==. 
Wikileaks made the documents available under embargo to a number of media organisations: ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Al Jazeera]]'', ''[[Le Monde]]'', the [[Bureau of Investigative Journalism]], and the [[Iraq Body Count project]]. <ref>{{cite news |title=The Iraq war logs: nearly 400,000 files document the war on a daily basis |publisher=[[Bureau of Investigative Journalism]] |date=22 October 2010 |url=http://thebureauinvestigates.com/2010/10/22/the-iraq-war-logs/ |accessdate=31 October 2010}}</ref>  Upon the lifting of the embargo, the media coverage by these groups was followed by further coverage by other media organisations.  ''[[The Guardian]]'' said that "the ''New York Times'', ''Washington Post'' and other papers were accused by web publications and some bloggers of downplaying the extent to which the documents revealed US complicity in torture and provided evidence that politicians in Washington "lied" about the failures of the US military mission". <ref name=media-reaction /> ''The Guardian'' had reported that "fresh evidence that US soldiers handed over detainees to a notorious Iraqi torture squad has emerged in army logs published by WikiLeaks",<ref>{{cite news |title=Iraq war logs: US turned over captives to Iraqi torture squads |first1=David |last1=Leigh |first2=Maggie |last2=O'Kane |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=24 October 2010 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/24/iraq-war-logs-us-iraqi-torture |accessdate=31 October 2010 |location=London}}</ref> and [[Glenn Greenwald]] of [[Salon.com]] commented that "media outlets around the world prominently highlighted this revelation, but not ''The New York Times''",<ref>{{cite news |title=NYT v. the world: WikiLeaks coverage |first=Glenn |last=Greenwald |newspaper=[[Salon.com]] |date=25 October 2010 |url=http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/10/25/nyt/index.html |accessdate=31 October 2010}}</ref> calling their coverage of the document leak "subservient" to the Pentagon, and criticising them for what he called a "gossipy, People Magazine-style 'profile' of Assange". <ref>{{cite news |title=More on the media's Pentagon-subservient WikiLeaks coverage |first=Glenn |last=Greenwald |newspaper=[[Salon.com]] |date=27 October 2010 |url=http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/10/27/burns/index.html |accessdate=31 October 2010}}</ref> .

[[World Health Organization]].

An article on the leaked documents in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' magazine commented on these sources, "Taking the WikiLeaks data into account, IBC now estimates that at least 150,000 have died violently during the war, 80% of them civilians. That falls within the range produced by an Iraq household survey conducted by the World Health Organization—and further erodes the credibility of a 2006 study published in The Lancet that estimated over 600,000 violent deaths for the first 3 years of the war."
