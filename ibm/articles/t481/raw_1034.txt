'''''Haaretz''''' ({{lang-he|הארץ}}) (lit. "The Land", originally ''Ḥadashot Ha'aretz'' – {{lang-he|חדשות הארץ}}, {{IPA-he|χadaˈʃot haˈʔaʁets|IPA}} – "News of the Land"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressreference.com/Gu-Ku/Israel.html |title=Israel Press, Media, TV, Radio, Newspapers – newspaper, television, news, circulation, stations, papers, number, print, freedom, broadcasting, advertising, role |publisher=Pressreference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-05}}</ref>) is [[Israel]]'s oldest [[daily newspaper]]. It was founded in 1918 and is now published in both [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[English language|English]] in [[Berliner (format)|Berliner]] format. The English edition is published and sold together with the ''[[International Herald Tribune]].'' Both Hebrew and English editions can be read on the Internet. In [[North America]], it comes out as a  [[weekly newspaper]], combining articles from the Friday edition with a roundup from the rest of the week.  . 

==Overview==. 
Compared to other mass circulation papers in Israel, ''Haaretz'' uses smaller headlines and print. Less space is devoted to pictures, and more to political analysis. Its editorial pages are considered influential among government leaders. <ref>{{cite journal |last=Beckerman |first=Gal |year=2005 |month=September/October |title=Disengaged |journal=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |url=http://cjrarchives.org/issues/2005/5/beckerman.asp |accessdate= 2007-06-21}}</ref>  Apart from the news, ''Haaretz'' publishes feature articles on social  and environmental issues, as well as book reviews, investigative reporting and political commentary. 
In 2008, the newspaper itself reported a paid subscribership of 65,000, daily sales of 72,000 copies, and 100,000 on weekends. <ref>Haaretz service.

Despite its relatively low circulation in Israel, ''Haaretz'' is considered Israel's most influential daily newspaper. <ref>Lucy Dean, ed.

==History and ownership==. 
''Haaretz'' was first published in 1918 as a newspaper sponsored by the British military government in Palestine. <ref>[http://www.tau.ac.il/institutes/bronfman/contents.html TAU – Institute of Jewish Press and Communications – The Andrea and Charles Bronfman Center<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 1919 it was taken over by Russian Zionists. <ref name="A fine and fragile balance">[http://www.haaretz.com/a-fine-and-fragile-balance-1.119759 A fine and fragile balance]</ref> Initially, it was called ''Hadashot Ha'aretz'' ("News of the Land"). Later, the name was shortened to "Ha'aretz". The literary section of the paper attracted the leading Hebrew writers of the time. <ref>Encyclopedia Judaica, ''Newspapers, Hebrew,'' vol. 12, Keter Books, Jerusalem, 1978</ref> . 

The newspaper was initially published in Jerusalem. From 1919 to 1922, the paper was headed by a succession of editors, among them [[Leib Yaffe]]. It was shut down briefly due to a budgetary shortfall and reopened in Tel Aviv at the beginning of 1923 under the editorship of Moshe Glickson, who held the post for 15 years. <ref name="A fine and fragile balance"/> The Tel Aviv municipality granted the paper financial support by paying in advance for future advertisements. <ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArtStEngPE.jhtml?itemNo=1157454&contrassID=2&subContrassID=15&title=%27Haaretz%20history%20%27&dyn_server=172.20.5.5 Haaretz history, Tom Segev]</ref> . 

[[Salman Schocken]], a wealthy German Jewish Zionist who owned a chain of department stores in Germany, bought the paper in 1937. His son, [[Gershom Schocken]], became the chief editor in 1939 and held that position until his death in 1990. <ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=209509&contrassID=2&subContrassID=4&sbSubContrassID=0&listSrc=Y A newspaper's mission – Haaretz – Israel News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . 

Until August 2006, the Schocken family owned 100% of the Haaretz Group, but then the German publisher [[M. DuMont Schauberg]] acquired 25 percent of the shares. <ref>[http://www.dumont.eu/dumont/dir/?101798 M. DuMont Schauberg. Press-release.] Last accessed: 16 August 2009. </ref> The deal was negotiated with the help of former Israeli ambassador to [[Germany]] Avi Primor. <ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=749876 Germany's DuMont invests 25m euros in Haaretz], ''Haaretz'', August 13, 2006. </ref> . 

On 12 June 2011, it was announced that Russian-Israeli businessman [[Leonid Nevzlin]] had purchased a 20% stake in the Haaretz Group, buying 15% from the family and 5% from M. DuMont Schauberg. This means that the Schocken family now owns 60% and M. DuMont Schauberg and Leonid Nevzlin have 20% each. <ref>[http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000653184&fid=1725 ''Globes'' report on Nevzlin's investment in Ha'aretz]</ref> . 

==Management==. 
The newspaper's editorial policy was defined by Gershom Schocken, who was editor-in-chief from 1939 to 1990. The current editor-in-chief of the newspaper is [[Aluf Benn]], who replaced [[Dov Alfon]] in August 2011. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,599005,00.html |title=Problems at Israel's Haaretz: Newspaper Without a Country – SPIEGEL ONLINE – News – International |publisher=Spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2010-03-05}}</ref> Alfon's predecessor, [[David Landau (journalist)|David Landau]], succeeded Hanoch Marmari<ref>Hanoch Marmari speaks about ''Haaretz'' http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:fIMAMItDFyMJ:www.pij.org/details.php%3Fid%3D376+gershom+gustav+schocken&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=4</ref> and [[Yoel Esteron]] in April 2004.

[[J.J. Goldberg]], the editor of the American ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'', describes ''Haaretz'' as "Israel's most vehemently anti-[[Israeli settlement|settlement]] daily paper". <ref>[http://www.forward.com/articles/104263/ Are Religious Soldiers To Blame for Alleged Abuse?] J.J.

==Criticism==. 
In 2001, the pro-Israel media-monitoring and advocacy group [[Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America|CAMERA]] claimed that ''Haaretz'' fueled anti-Israel bias,<ref>{{cite web|last=Levin |first=Andrea |url=http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=2&x_outlet=55&x_article=171 |title=Ha’aretz Fuels Anti-Israel Bias |publisher=CAMERA |date= |accessdate=2010-03-05}}</ref> but a 2003 study in ''The Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics'' found that ''Haaretz'' reporting was more favorable to Israelis than Palestinians, and more likely to report stories from the Israeli side. <ref>Matt Viser. Attempted objectivity: An analysis of the New York Times and Ha'aretz and their portrayals of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. ''The Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics.'' 2003, Vol. 8, No. 4, 114–120. </ref> Many Israelis, however, feel that ''Haaretz'' is biased against their own country: in 2002, Israeli author [[Irit Linur]] canceled her subscription, accusing ''Haaretz''' of an [[anti-Zionist]] theme that turns too often to "foolish" and "wicked" journalism,<ref name="IritLetter">[http://www.nfc.co.il/archive/0019-D-1068-00.html?tag=14-23-47#PTEXT1597 Irit Linur's letter (quotation)] News First Class {{he icon}}<br />– Translation: ''it is a person's right to be a radical leftist, and publish a newspaper in accordance to his world view...

According to its competitor ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', ''Haaretz'' editor-in-chief [[David Landau (journalist)|David Landau]] said at the 2007 [[Limmud]] conference in [[Moscow]] that he had told his staff not to report about criminal investigations against Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] in order to promote Sharon's 2004–2005 [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|Gaza disengagement plan]]. <ref>[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1192380656935&pagename=JPArticle%2FShowFull Limmud diary: Creme de la Kremlin?]</ref><ref>[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1222017555401&pagename=JPArticle%2FShowFull Media Matters: Peripheral vision – one Acre and half a dunam]</ref><ref>[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1192380752316&pagename=JPArticle%2FShowFull Shame on 'Haaretz'] by Isi Leibler, ''Jerusalem Post'', November 6, 2007} Retrieved 2011-09-11</ref> . 

In March 2010, ''The Jerusalem Post'' reported that a pollster was unhappy with the way his poll results regarding Israeli views regarding President Obama were presented in the English edition of ''Haaretz'', which he felt was "misleading", due to the fact that the Hebrew word "inyani" had been interpreted as "fair" instead of "businesslike". <ref>Gil Hoffman, [http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?ID=171506 "Haaretz fiddled with Obama poll"], ''Jerusalem Post'', March 22, 2010. </ref> Also in 2010, several columnists at ''The Jerusalem Post'', including deputy managing editor [[Caroline Glick]], criticized ''Haaretz'' for its role in the [[Anat Kamm]] affair. <ref>Michael Freund, [http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=173150 Fundamentally Freund: Awakening the Left"], ''Jerusalem Post'', April 14, 2010. </ref><ref>[[Caroline Glick]], [http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Article.aspx?ID=173305 "The Haaretz spy scandal: Haaretz provides Israeli affirmation for anti-Israel attitudes"], ''Jerusalem Post'', April 16, 2010. </ref><ref>Ben-Dror Yemini, [http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?id=173539 "Haaretz could not be more wrong – or misleading"], ''Jerusalem Post'', April 20, 2010. </ref> .
