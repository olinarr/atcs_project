{{Freedom}}
'''Suppression of dissent''' occurs when an individual or group which is more [[power (sociology)|powerful]] than another tries to directly or indirectly [[censorship|censor]], [[persecute]] or otherwise [[oppress]] the other party, rather than engage with and constructively respond to or accommodate the other party's [[argument]]s or viewpoint. When [[dissent]] is perceived as a threat, action may be taken to prevent continuing dissent or penalize [[dissident]]s. [[Government]] or [[industry]]<ref name="Suppression of dissent">Brian Martin, "''[http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/dissent/intro/DNAleaflet.html Suppression of dissent]: what it is and what to do about it''". Science, Technology & Society, University of Wollongong. </ref> may often act in this way.  . 

==Types of suppression==. 
Types of suppression include:
# Direct action
# Indirect actions
# [[Self-censorship]] . 

''Direct action'' tries to silence the dissenter via factors or influences in a forthright manner, often coercive. ''Indirect action'' tries to silence the dissenter via intervening factors or influences, but not in a forthright manner. ''Self-censorship'' occurs when individuals are concerned about risking their employment status, standing in an academic course and/or ability to live without threat. It is a [[social action]]. Some dissenters fear direct actions taken against them. Self-censorship makes direct and indirect suppression unnecessary. <ref name="Suppression of dissent"/> . 

==Areas of suppression==. 
===Society and speech===. 
{{Censorship}}
Suppression of dissent is undesirable in society for a variety of fundamental reasons. [[Freedom of speech]] is a [[wikt:cardinal|cardinal rule]] for a [[free society]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Dissent is essential to allow all points of view to be given and considered. [[Censorship]] plays a central role in the control of [[Speech communication|speech]] and other forms of human [[expression]],{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}} often by government intervention (through [[crime|criminalization]] or [[Law|other regulation]]). It is most commonly applied to acts which occur in [[public]] circumstances, and most formally involves suppression of ideas by criminalizing or regulating expression. This differs from self-censorship, though. Self-censorship is when an individual censors and/or [[Classified Information|classifies]] his/her own speech to avoid offending others, and without authority requiring them to do so. But, especially in some [[authoritarian]] countries, the fear of [[secret police]] organizations and possible government backlash against individuals may result in an indirect suppression of dissent via self-censorship. Sanitization (removal) and whitewashing (from [[whitewash]]) are almost interchangeable terms with censorship that refer to a particular form of censorship via omission, which seeks to "clean up" the portrayal of particular issues and facts which are already known, but which may [[:wikt:conflict|conflict]] with the official point of view. In democratic countries, self-censorship is also a possible phenomenon, particularly in times of crisis.  . 

In greater society the typical example of suppression of dissent is when a company fires a [[whistleblower]]. [[Cultural suppression]] can exhibit facets of dissenting suppression, especially when used as part of [[social control]] and the promotion of another more powerful culture over a minority's culture. The devious use of governmental power, political campaign strategy, and resources aimed at suppressing (i.e. reducing) the total vote of opposition candidacies in [[voter suppression]] is a typical governmental occurrence of suppression of dissent. Sometimes laws are enacted to suppress dissent, South Africa enacted the [[Suppression of Communism Act]] to ban [[organization]]s that supported [[communism]] (and other activities).  . 

===Academia===. 
In [[academia]], the [[peer review]] process is occasionally cited as suppressing dissent against "[[mainstream]]" theories (part of an overall system of "suppression of intellectual dissent"). [[Robert Anton Wilson]], in "The New Inquisition" (New Falcon Publications, 1991), called this an [[inquisition]] of the editors and reviewers of scientific journals, of leading authorities and self-appointed "skeptics", and of corporations and governments that have a vested interest. <ref>R. Börner, "''[http://www.suppressedscience.net/physics.html The Suppression of Inconvenient Facts in Physics]''". 2004. </ref> Some [[Science and technology studies|sociologists of science]] argue that peer review makes the ability to publish susceptible to control by [[elite]]s and to personal jealousy. Reviewers tend to be especially critical of conclusions that contradict their own [[view]]s, and lenient towards those that accord with them. At the same time, elite scientists are more likely than less established ones to be sought out as referees, particularly by high-prestige journals or [[publisher]]s. As a result, it has been argued, ideas that harmonize with the elites are more likely to see print and to appear in premier journals than are [[iconoclast]]ic or revolutionary ones, which accords with [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s well-known observations regarding scientific revolutions.  . 

To express the notion of intellectual dissent suppression, a situation has these features:<ref>Brian Martin, C.M. Ann Baker, Clyde Manwell and Cedric Pugh (editors), Intellectual Suppression: Australian Case Histories, Analysis and Responses, [http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/86is/elites.html Elites and suppression]. (Sydney: Angus & Robertson, 1986), pp. 185–199. </ref>
# a power structure, with some vested interest groups with power and privilege. 
# views or techniques, methodologies, procedures, and processes in which dissent from is possible. 
# an alternative source of power (e.g., an alternative power structure) . 

Generally, science is presented as a "noble search" for truth, in which advancement depends on inquiring about established ideas and concepts. <ref name="Stamping Out Dissent">Brian Martin, "''[http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/93nw.html Stamping Out Dissent]; Too often, unconventional or unpopular scientific views are simply suppressed''". Newsweek, 26 April 1993, pp. 49–50</ref> Reportedly, scientists do not see an occasional error as a flaw in science—they maintain that science is a self-correcting system, and that with substantial evidence, any true investigation into encountered anomalies will result in a change in basic assumptions within the ruling theory of science. But for many dissenters, this is declared as a painful myth. <ref name="Stamping Out Dissent"/> From various experiences, disagreement with the dominant view comes with danger or risk (personally and professionally). Some researchers and scientists refrain from looking over theories carefully which demonstrates science's undesirable or negative qualities. <ref>[http://www.unsafescience.com/aids.html unsafescience.com, aids]</ref> Often, a portion of representatives within the prevailing scientific view attack the critic's ideas that go against the dominant ruling theory. Representatives may also attack the critic personally by various methods, including (but not limited to):
* deleting parts of writing,<ref name="uow.edu.au">[http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/dissent/intro/DNAleaflet.html Suppression of dissent: what it is and what to do about it]</ref>
* obstructing publications,<ref name="uow.edu.au"/>
* forced withdrawal of research grants,<ref name="uow.edu.au"/>
* denying work in a particular field,<ref name="uow.edu.au"/>
* [[ostracism]] from social circles<ref name="uow.edu.au"/>
* dissemination of rumors. <ref name="uow.edu.au"/> . 

[[Academic freedom]] is the freedom of teachers, students, and academic institutions to pursue knowledge wherever it may lead, without undue or unreasonable interference.  . 

===Conspiracy theories===. 
[[Free energy suppression]] is a [[conspiracy theory]] claiming that certain [[Lobby groups|special interest groups]] are suppressing alternative views in science. Groups most often implicated in such activity are the [[oil industry]], petroleum [[Central government|national governments]], entrenched tenured faculty, the [[pharmaceutical industry]], and additionally, [[automaker]]s. The most common perceived motive is preservation of the economic [[status quo]] and sustained increase of fuel (and drug) prices (as well as preservation of the demand for fuel/drugs.) . 

==Responses==. 
Responses to various acts of [[suppression]] against [[dissent]] include:
# Do not act against the suppression. 
# Use unofficially recognized or controlled methods. 
# Use officially recognized or controlled channels. 
# Put into service relevant [[legislation]], [[policies]], and [[regulation]]s. 
# Fetch supporting [[organization]]s (such as [[trade union]]s). 
# Prepare and conduct a [[Advertising|publicity]] [[Advertising campaign|campaign]].  . 

Doing nothing against the acts of suppression often allows the state of being suppressed (and associated existing errors and fallacies) to continue. Furthermore, doing nothing does not give rise to support for the dissident views. If [[critic]]s decide to "[[toe the line|toe the mark]]" and "keep out of sight", the critic may be re-accepted by the opponent. This passive agreement without protest means that other dissents are likely to encounter the same difficulties. <ref name="Suppression of dissent"/> .

Use of unofficially and officially recognized or controlled channels has been used as a means of alleviating the state of suppression (and associated existing errors and fallacies), such as [[protest]]ing, [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrating]], [[Strike action|striking]], [[civil disobedience]], or other similar actions to attempt to directly enact desired changes themselves. Using formal channels against decisions, using internal procedures, bringing [[appeal]]s to the appropriate [[committee]] or [[Government agency|commission]], and launching [[legal action]]s has also been used to enact desired changes. Proposing legislation, policies, and regulations has been used to help alleviate the situation. If such exist, dissenters have used these to alleviate the situation, also.  .
