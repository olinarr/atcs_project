A '''strategic lawsuit against public participation''' ('''SLAPP''') is a [[lawsuit]] that is intended to [[censorship|censor]], intimidate, and silence critics by burdening them with the cost of a [[legal defense]] until they abandon their criticism or opposition. <ref name="onthemedia_01">{{cite web

The typical SLAPP plaintiff does not normally expect to win the lawsuit. The plaintiff's goals are accomplished if the defendant succumbs to fear, intimidation, mounting legal costs or simple exhaustion and abandons the criticism. A SLAPP may also intimidate others from participating in the debate. A SLAPP is often preceded by a [[legal threat]]. The difficulty, of course, is that plaintiffs do not present themselves to the Court admitting that their intent is to censor, intimidate or silence their critics. Hence, the difficulty in drafting SLAPP legislation, and in applying it, is to craft an approach which affords an early termination to invalid abusive suits, without denying a legitimate day in court to valid [[good faith]] claims.  . 

SLAPPs take various forms but the most common is a civil suit for [[defamation]], which in the [[English common law]] tradition is a [[tort]]. The [[common law of libel]] dates to the early 17th century and (unusual in English law) is [[reverse onus]], meaning, once accused, the defendant is presumed guilty until they can prove innocence. While various abusive uses of this law including [[political libel]] (criticism of the political actions or views of others) have ceased to exist in most places but persist in some jurisdictions (notably [[British Columbia]] and [[Ontario]]) where political views can be held as defamatory. A common feature of SLAPP suits is [[forum shopping]] wherein plaintiffs find favourable courts that will permit claims that the court in which the defendant (or sometimes plaintiffs) live, will not.  . 

Other widely mentioned elements of a SLAPP are the actual effectiveness at silencing critics, the timing of the suit, inclusion of extra or spurious defendants (such as relatives or hosts of legitimate defendants), inclusion of plaintiffs with no real claim (such as corporations that are affiliated with legitimate plaintiffs), making claims that are very difficult to disprove or rely on no written record, ambiguous or deliberately mangled wording that lets plaintiffs make spurious allegations without fear of [[perjury]], refusal to consider any settlement (or none other than cash), characterization of all offers to settle as insincere, extensive and unnecessary demands for discovery, attempts to identify [[anonymity|anonymous or pseudonymous]] critics, appeals on minor points of law, demands for broad rulings when appeal is accepted on such minor points of law, and attempts to run up defendants' costs even if this clearly costs more to the plaintiffs.  . 

==History==. 
The [[acronym]] was coined in the 1980s by [[University of Denver]] professors Penelope Canan and George W. Pring.

The term was originally defined as "a lawsuit involving communications made to influence a governmental action or outcome, which resulted in a civil complaint or counterclaim filed against nongovernment individuals or organizations on a substantive issue of some public interest or social significance." The concept originators later dropped the notion that government contact had to be about a public issue to be protected by the [[Right to petition in the United States|Right to Petition]] the Government as provided in the [[First Amendment]]. It has since been defined less broadly by some states and more broadly in one state (California) where it includes suits about speech on any public issue.

The original conceptualization proffered by Canan and Pring emphasized the right to petition as protected in the United States under the US Constitution's specific protection in the First Amendment's fifth clause. It is still definitional: SLAPPs refer to civil lawsuits filed against those who have communicated to government officialdom (in its entire constitutional apparatus). The Right to Petition granted by [[Edgar the Peaceful]], King of England in the 10th century, antedates the [[Magna Carta]] in terms of its significance in the development of democratic institutions. As currently conceived, the right claims that democracy cannot function if there are, or if interest groups can erect, barriers between the governed and the governing. <ref name="right_to_petition_01">{{cite journal|url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3486&context=flr|journal=Fordham Law Review|volume=66|issue=6|date=1998-01-01|title=The Vestigial Constitution: The History and Significance of the Right to Petition | author=Gregory A.

According to [[New York Supreme Court]] Judge J. Nicholas Colabella, "Short of a gun to the head, a greater threat to First Amendment expression can scarcely be imagined." A number of jurisdictions have made such suits illegal, provided that the appropriate standards of [[journalistic responsibility]] have been met by the critic.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} . 

==Jurisdictional variations==. 
===Canada===. 
Some [[political libel]] and [[forum shopping]] incidents, both common in Canada, have been called SLAPP suits, because such suits load defendants with costs of responding in unfamiliar jurisdictions or at times (typically elections) when they're extremely busy and short of funds. Both types of suits are almost unique to Canada, so there is little academic concern nor examination of whether political subject matter or remote forums are a clear indicator of SLAPP.  . 

====BC====. 
One of the first cases in Canada to be explicitly ruled a SLAPP was ''Fraser v. Saanich'' (see [1999] B.C.J. No. 3100 (B.C. S.C.)) (QL), where the British Columbia Supreme Court struck out the claim of a hospital director against the District of Saanich, holding that it was a meritless action designed to silence or intimidate the residents who were opposed to the plaintiff’s plan to redevelop the hospital facilities.  . 

Following the decision in ''Fraser v. Saanich'', the ''Protection of Public Participation Act'' went into effect in British Columbia in April, 2001. [http://www.adidem.org/images/a/a7/Wullum_AntiSLAPP.pdf The legislation] was repealed in August, 2001. There was [http://www.elc.uvic.ca/publications/documents/Reciel-2010-SLAPP-BC-Tollefson-Scott.pdf extensive debate on its merits and the necessity of having hard criteria for judges] and whether this tended to reduce or increase process abuse. The debate was largely formed by the first case to discuss and apply the Protection of Public Participation Act (PPPA), ''Home Equity Development v. Crow'', (see [2002] B.C.J. No. 1805 (B.C. S.C.)) (QL). The defendants' application to dismiss the action against them was dismissed. The defendants failed to meet the burden of proof required by the PPPA, that the plaintiffs had no reasonable prospect of success. While it was not the subject of the case, some felt that the plaintiffs did not bring their action for an improper purpose, and the suit did not inhibit the defendants in their public criticism of the particular project, and that the Act was therefore ineffective in this case.  . 

Since the repeal, BC activists especially the [[BCCLA]] have argued repeatedly for a broad understanding of SLAPP and a broad interpretation of judicial powers especially in [http://www.bccla.org/othercontent/09Canwest_Intervener_application.pdf intervener applications in BC] and [http://www.bccla.org/othercontent/Ecosociete_BCCLA_argument.pdf other common law jurisdictions] and when [http://www.bccla.org/positions/political/11BC_Slapp.pdf arguing for new legislation to prevent SLAPPs]. The activist literature contains extensive research on particular cases and criteria. The [[West Coast Environmental Law Association]] agrees and generally considers BC to lag other jurisdictions [http://wcel.org/resources/environmental-law-alert/bc-trails-quebec-ontario-protecting-public-chilling-lawsuits]. So do some BC lawyers, again listing specific cases [http://envirolaw.com/unsuccessful-slapps/].  . 

====Ontario====. 
In Ontario, the decision in ''Daishowa v. Friends of the Lubicon'' (see [1996] O.J. No. 3855 Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.) (QL) was also instructive on SLAPPs. A motion brought by the corporate plaintiff Daishowa to impose conditions on the defendant Friends of the Lubicon Indian Band that they would not represent Daishowa’s action as a SLAPP was dismissed.  . 

By 2010, the Ontario Attorney-General considered SLAPP a major problem and issued a major report on them
[http://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/anti_slapp/]. However, a year later nothing substantial had changed, according to commentators [http://lawiscool.com/2011/10/06/renewing-the-debate-on-anti-slapp-legislation-in-ontario/].  . 

====Quebec====. 
Québec's then Justice Minister, Jacques Dupuis, proposed an anti-SLAPP bill on June 13, 2008. 
<ref name="ulcc_slapp_01">{{cite web|url=http://www.ulcc.ca/en/poam2/SLAPP%20Report.pdf|title=Strategic Lawsuits against Public Participation (SLAPPs) (and other abusive lawsuits)|last=Pelletier|first=Vincent|publisher=[http://www.ulcc.ca/ Uniform Law Conference of Canada, Civil Section] (English and French)|year=2008|month=August|accessdate=2011-06-29}}</ref>
The bill was adopted by the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] on June 3, 2009. As of November 2011, Quebec's amended Code of Civil Procedure is the only anti-SLAPP mechanism in force in Canada.  . 

This bill was invoked in Ontario (and then [[Supreme Court of Canada]] docket 33819) in the case of Les Editions Ecosociete Inc., [[Alain Deneault]], [[Delphine Abadie]] and [[William Sacher]] vs. [[Banro]] Inc., in which the publisher Ecosociete pled (supported by the [[BCCLA]] [http://www.bccla.org/othercontent/Ecosociete_BCCLA_argument.pdf]) that it should not face Ontario liability for a publication in Quebec, as the suit was a SLAPP and the Quebec law explicitly provided to dismiss these. ''As of November 15, 2011, the judgement was still pending, having been heard in the Court in March of 2011.'' . 

The Quebec law is substantially different in structure than that of California [http://www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide/anti-slapp-law-california] or other jurisdictions, however as Quebec's Constitution generally subordinates itself to [[international law]], the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] applies. That treaty only permits liability for arbitrary and unlawful speech. The ICCPR has also been cited, in the BC case Crookes v. Newton, as the standard for balancing free speech versus reputation rights. The Supreme Court of Canada in October 2011, ruling in that case, neither reiterated nor rescinded that standard.  . 

===United States===. 
California has a unique variant of anti-SLAPP legislation which has led a significant volume of SLAPP litigation in that state. A search for reported cases on SLAPP litigation in 2009 found 1,386 cases for the State of California alone. The rest of the states combined had about 341, of which Massachusetts accounted for 176, raising the question whether California's SLAPP statute is accomplishing its primary objective of reducing costly litigation
<ref name="navellier_v_sletten_01">{{cite web|url=http://www.casp.net/california-anti-slapp-first-amendment-law-resources/caselaw/california-supreme-court/navellier-v-sletten/|title=Navellier v. Sletten|publisher = California Anti-SLAPP Project [http://www.casp.net www.casp.net]|accessdate=2011-06-29}} 52 P.3d 703 (Cal. 2002) (dissenting opinion)</ref> The [[U.S. state]] of [[California]] enacted Code of Civil Procedure § 425.16 in [[1992]], a [[statute]] intended to frustrate SLAPPs by providing a quick and inexpensive defense. <ref name ="ccp_425_16_01"/> It provides for a special motion that a [[defendant]] can file at the outset of a lawsuit to strike a [[complaint]] when it arises from conduct that falls within the rights of [[petition]] or [[free speech]]. The statute expressly applies to any writing or speech made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law, but there is no requirement that the writing or speech be promulgated directly to the official body. It also applies to speech in a public forum about an issue of public interest and to any other petition or speech conduct about an issue of public interest.  . 

To win an anti-SLAPP motion, the defendant must first show that the lawsuit is based on constitutionally protected activity. Then, the burden shifts to the plaintiff, to affirmatively present evidence to show that they have a reasonable probability of prevailing on the action. The filing of an anti-SLAPP motion stays all [[Discovery (law)|discovery]]. This feature acts to greatly reduce the cost of litigation to the anti-SLAPP defendant, and can make beating the motion extremely difficult for the plaintiff, because they effectively must prove their case without the benefit of discovery.  . 

If the special motion is denied, the order denying the motion is immediately [[appeal]]able. Defendants prevailing on an anti-SLAPP motion (including any subsequent appeal) are entitled to a mandatory award of reasonable attorney’s fees. After an anti-SLAPP motion has been filed, a plaintiff cannot escape this mandatory fee award by amending its complaint. More than 300 published court opinions have interpreted and applied California's anti-SLAPP law.

There is no federal anti-SLAPP law. The extent to which state laws apply in federal courts is unclear, and the Circuit courts have reached different conclusions. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] has allowed California litigants to use their state's special motion in [[United States district court|federal district courts]] located in California, in cases where the court is hearing at least one California state law claim through the doctrine of [[supplemental jurisdiction]].

It has been argued that the lack of uniform protection against SLAPPs has encouraged [[forum shopping]]; proponents of federal legislation have argued that the uncertainty about one's level of protection has likely magnified the [[chilling effect (law)|chilling effect]] of SLAPPs.  . 

In December 2009, Rep. [[Steve Cohen]] introduced the Citizen Participation Act in the U.S. House. 
<ref name="cohen_hr_4364">{{cite web
| url = http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4364/text

This marks the first time the Congress has considered federal anti-SLAPP legislation (though the Congress is currently considering the closely related issue of ''[[libel tourism]]''.) Like many state anti-SLAPP laws, H.R. 4364 would allow the defendant of a SLAPP to have the suit quickly dismissed and to recover fees and costs.  . 

====Balancing the Right of Access to the Courts====. 
The SLAPP penalty stands as a barrier to access to the Courts by providing an early penalty to claimants who seek judicial redress. In recent years, the courts in some states have recognized that enforcement of SLAPP legislation must recognize and balance the constitutional rights of both litigants. It has been said:
<blockquote>Since the [[Magna Carta]], the world has recognized the importance of justice in a free society. “To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay, right or justice.” (Magna Carta, 1215.) This nation’s founding fathers knew people would never consent to be governed and surrender their right to decide disputes by force, unless government offered a just forum for resolving those disputes.

</blockquote> . 

The right to bring grievances to the courts, in good faith, is protected by state and federal constitutions in a variety of ways. In most states, the right to trial by jury in civil cases is recognized. The right to cross-examine witnesses is fundamental to our judicial system. Moreover, the first amendment protects the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances. The “right to petition extends to all departments of the Government. The right of access to the courts is indeed but one aspect of the right of petition.”

In Palazzo v. Alves (No. 2006-172-Appeal) the Court wrote:
<blockquote>By the nature of their subject matter, anti-SLAPP statutes require meticulous drafting. On the one hand, it is desirable to seek to shield citizens from improper intimidation when exercising their constitutional right to be heard with respect to issues of public concern. On the other hand, it is important that such statutes be limited in scope lest the constitutional right of access to the courts (whether by private figures, public figures, or public officials) be improperly thwarted. There is a genuine double-edged challenge to those who legislate in this area.{{citation}}<ref name="palazzo_v_ives_944_a2d_144">{{cite web

The most challenging balancing problem arises in application to SLAPP claims which do not sound in [[tort]]. The [[common law]] and [[constitutional law]] have developed in the United States to create a high substantive burden to tort and tort-like claims which seek redress for [[public speech]], especially public speech which addresses matters of public concern. The common law in many states requires the pleader to state accurately the content of [[libel]]ous words. Constitutional law has provided substantive protection which bars recovery against a first amendment defense except upon clear and convincing evidence that there has been deliberate or reckless falsehood. For this reason, ferreting out the [[bad faith]] SLAPP claim at an early stage of litigation should be accomplished with relative ease. Extension of the SLAPP penalties to factually complex cases, where the substantive standard of proof at common law is lower presents special challenges.  . 

A Minnesota Supreme Court case Middle-Snake-Tamarac Rivers Watershed Dist. v. Stengrim, 784 N.W.2d 834 (Minn. 2010) establishes a two step process to determine whether SLAPP procedure should be applied. The decision arises in the context of an effort to enforce a settlement agreement between a local government and an opponent of a flood control project. The landowner had accepted a significant monetary settlement in settlement of his opposition to land acquisition. The landowner agreed as part of the settlement to address no further challenges to the project. When the local government sued the landowner for breach of settlement, the landowner contended that enforcement of the settlement was a strategic lawsuit against public participation. The Supreme Court rejected that claim and affirmed the District Court's denial of SLAPP relief, holding “The District Court properly denied a motion to dismiss where the underlying claim involved an alleged breach of a settlement agreement that potentially limited the moving party’s rights to public participation.” The Supreme Court explained: <blockquote>
Preexisting legal relationships, such as those based on a settlement agreement where a party waives certain rights, may legitimately limit a party’s public participation. It would be illogical to read sections 554.01-.05 as providing presumptive immunity to actions that a moving party may have contractually agreed to forgo or limit. </blockquote> . 

Under the Minnesota approach, as a preliminary matter, the moving party must meet the burden of showing that the circumstances which bring the case within the purview of SLAPP protection exists. Until that has been accomplished, no clear and convincing burden has been shifted to the responding party.  .

Winner's report, "Findings on Judicial Practices & Court-appointed Personnel In The Family Courts In Dorchester, Charleston & Berkeley Counties, South Carolina" and citizen demonstrations led to the very first laws in South Carolina to establish minimum standards and licensing requirements for guardians ad litem — who represent the interests of children in court cases. <ref>William J.

* {{main|Congress Elementary School District v. Warren, et. al.}}
:In effort to prevent four women from filing any Public Records Requests without first getting permission from a judge, or from filing future lawsuits, the Congress Elementary School District [[Congress Elementary School District v. Warren, et. al.|filed a SLAPP suit]] on January 28, 2010. [[The Goldwater Institute]], a think tank based in [[Phoenix, AZ]], represented the four defendants. The school district said that it has been harassed so often by Warren that it was not able to functionally educate its students. Toni Wayas, the school district’s superintendent, claimed "that it had, time and time again, complied with the requests" The Goldwater Institute argued that the school district had been in violation of state laws mandating government transparency in the past. Investigations in 2002 and 2007 by the state Ombudsman and Attorney General uncovered violations of the state’s open meeting law by the Attorney General’s Office. According to Carrie Ann Sitren of the Goldwater Institute, this was “a clear attempt to silence people in the community who have been critical of the board’s actions, and have made good-faith attempts to ensure the district is spending taxpayer money wisely.” None of the records requested were private or confidential, and thus, should have been readily available to be released to the public, according to the assistant state Ombudsman. <ref name="congress_school_district_v_warren">{{cite web

===Canada===. 
* ''Daishowa Inc. v. Friends of the Lubicon'', from 1995 to 1998 a series of judgements [OJ 1536 1995] [OJ 1429 1998 (ONGD)] established that defendants, who had accused a global company of engaging in "[[genocide]]", were entitled to recover court costs<ref>http://sisis.nativeweb.org/lubicon/nov1098.html</ref> due to the public interest in the criticism, even if it was rhetorically unjustifiable. This was the first case to establish clearly the SLAPP criteria
* ''Fraser v. Saanich (District)'' 1995, [BCJ 3100 BCSC] was held explicitly to be a SLAPP, the first known case to be so described. Justice Singh found plaintiff's conduct to be "reprehensible and deserving of censure", ordering he pay "special costs" [page 48, Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation: The British Columbia Experience, RECEIL 19(1) 2010 ISSN 0962 8797] to compensate. 
* In 2011, in ''Robin Scory v. Glen Valley Watersheds Society'', a BC court ruled that "an order for special costs acts as a deterrent to litigants whose purpose is to interfere with the democratic process,” and that “Public participation and dissent is an important part of our democratic system.”<ref>http://www.ecojustice.ca/media-centre/press-releases/b.c.-developer-ordered-to-pay-for-failed-defamation-suit-against-local-conservation-group</ref><ref>http://www.ecojustice.ca/media-centre/press-releases/ecojustice-scores-big-victory-for-the-little-guys/?searchterm=glen%20valley</ref> However, such awards remained rare. <ref>http://wcel.org/resources/environmental-law-alert/bc-trails-quebec-ontario-protecting-public-chilling-lawsuits</ref>
* ''Crookes v. Openpolitics.ca'', filed May 2006 [S063287, Supreme Court of BC], and a series of related suits leading to a unanimous October 2011 ruling by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in Crookes v. Newton upholding the rights of online debaters to link freely to third parties without fear of liability for contents at the other end of the link. <ref>http://www.thestar.com/news/article/1072362</ref> A number of related rulings had previously established that transient comments on the Internet could not be, in themselves, simply printed and used to prove that "publication" had occurred for purposes of libel and defamation law in Canada. Other elements of the ruling clarified how [[responsible journalism]] (and therefore the right to protect [[anonymous source]]s), [[qualified privilege]] and [[innocent dissemination]] defenses applied to persons accused of online defamation. 
* In May 2010, [[Youthdale Treatment Centres]] of Toronto, Ontario filed a defamation suit against various former patients, parents of former patients, and other persons, claiming C$5,000.000.00 in damages.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The lawsuit, filed on May 5, 2010 on behalf of Youthdale by Harvin Pitch and Jennifer Lake of Teplitsky, Colson LLP claimed that these persons were involved in a conspiracy to, among other things, have Youthdale's licence to operate revoked. Youthdale also claimed their reputation was damaged as a result of various actions by the named defendants, which Youthdale alleged included the creation of websites and blogs containing complaints against Youthdale, including alleged accusations of unlawful administration of psychotropic medications. A notable left-turn for Youthdale occurred in July 2010, when Youthdale became the subject of a [[Toronto Star]] investigation, in which it was found that Youthdale had been admitting children to its Secure Treatment Unit that did not have mental disorders. <ref>{{cite news|author=Zlomislic, Diana|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/Investigations/article/832911|title=Youth lock-ups blasted|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=July 7, 2010}}</ref> The case is still ongoing against some of the named defendants. 
* Businesspeople [[Garth Drabinsky]] and [[Conrad Black]] filed numerous suits against critics of their business activities. These received much publicity but were usually settled quickly. 
* Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] filed a suit against the [[Liberal Party of Canada]], the Official Opposition, after the latter paid for trucks to drive through the streets playing a journalist's tape of Harper admitting he knew of "financial considerations" offered to dying MP [[Chuck Cadman]] before a critical [[Canadian House of Commons]] vote in 2005. This, the Liberals and most commentators and authorities agreed, would be a serious crime if proven. Harper alleged the tape had been altered but a court found no evidence of this. The suit was dropped by [[Michael Ignatieff]] after he replaced [[Stephane Dion]] as Leader of the Opposition, and so was not heard in court, but was transparently a (successful) effort to get the trucks off the streets.  . 

===Brazil===. 
* ThyssenKrupp Atlantic Steel Company (TKCSA), one of the largest private enterprises in Latin America, sues Brazilian researches from public universities as UERJ (Rio de Janeiro State University) and Fiocruz (Oswaldo Cruz Foundation) for moral damages<ref>http://www.justicanostrilhos.org/nota/882</ref>. <ref>http://www.ejolt.org/2012/01/urgent-campaign-to-stop-tkcsa-doing-damage/</ref> First, TKCSA sued the researcher pulmonologist, Hermano Albuquerque de Castro from Sergio Arouca National School of Public Health (ENSP – Fiocruz). Then TKCSA sued Alexandre Pessoa Dias research professor of the Joaquim Venâncio Polytechnic School of Health (EPSJV – Fiocruz) and the biologist Monica Cristina Lima, from Pedro Ernesto University Hospital and board member of the Public University Workers Union of Rio de Janeiro State (Sintuperj). The last two lawsuits occurred after the disclosure of the technical report “Evaluation of social, environmental and health impacts caused by the setup and operation of TKCSA in Santa Cruz”.  .
