In November 2010, WikiLeaks collaborated with major global media organisations to release [[United States diplomatic cables leak|U.S. State department diplomatic cables]] in redacted format.

===Purpose===. 
The WikiLeaks website says their goal is "to bring important news and information to the public... One of our most important activities is to publish original source material alongside our news stories so readers and historians alike can see evidence of the truth." . 

Another of the organisation's goals is to ensure that [[whistleblower]]s and journalists are not jailed for emailing sensitive or classified documents. The online "drop box" (currently not functioning) was designed to "provide an innovative, secure and anonymous way for sources to leak information to our journalists." . 

In an interview on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', Assange discussed the limit to the freedom of speech, saying, "[it is] not an ultimate freedom, however free speech is what regulates government and regulates law. That is why in the [[US Constitution]] the Bill of Rights says that Congress is to make no such law abridging the freedom of the press. It is to take the rights of the press outside the rights of the law because those rights are superior to the law because in fact they create the law. Every constitution, every bit of legislation is derived from the flow of information. Similarly every government is elected as a result of people understanding things". <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/260785/april-12-2010/exclusive---julian-assange-extended-interview |publisher= Colbert Nation |date= 12 April 2010 |title =Exclusive&nbsp;– Julian Assange Extended Interview}}</ref> .

The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has ruled that the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] guarantees anonymity, at least in the area of [[political discourse]]. <ref name="LinuxworldWikileaks1"/> Author and journalist [[Whitley Strieber]] has spoken about the benefits of the WikiLeaks project, noting that "Leaking a government document can mean jail, but jail sentences for this can be fairly short. However, there are many places where it means long incarceration or even death, such as China and parts of Africa and the Middle East."<ref>{{Cite news |title=How to be a Whistle Blower |url=http://www.unknowncountry.com/news/how-be-whistle-blower |work=Unknowncountry.com |date=17 January 2007 |accessdate=17 December 2010}}</ref> . 

==Administration==. 
According to a January 2010 interview, the WikiLeaks team then consisted of five people working full-time and about 800 people who worked occasionally, none of whom were compensated. <ref name="leakonomy"/> WikiLeaks has no official headquarters.  . 

===Hosting===.

Until August 2010, WikiLeaks was hosted by [[PRQ]], a Sweden-based company providing "highly secure, no-questions-asked hosting services".

Furthermore, "WikiLeaks maintains its own servers at undisclosed locations, keeps no logs and uses military-grade [[encryption]] to protect sources and other confidential information."

On 17 August 2010, it was announced that the Swedish [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Pirate Party]] would be hosting and managing many of WikiLeaks' new servers. The party donates servers and bandwidth to WikiLeaks without charge.

===Name servers===. 
WikiLeaks had been using EveryDNS's services, which led to [[DDoS]] attacks on the host.{{clarify|date=December 2010|reason=reword to make clear what host is meant and why using EveryDNS led to DDoS}} The attacks affected the quality of service at EveryDNS, so the company withdrew its service from WikiLeaks. Pro-WikiLeaks supporters retaliated by launching a DDoS attack against EveryDNS. Because of mistakes in the blogosphere, some supporters accidentally mistook EasyDNS for EveryDNS and a sizable internet backlash against EasyDNS ensued. Afterwards EasyDNS decided to provide WikiLeaks its name server service. <ref>{{Cite news |title=Canadian firm caught up in Wiki wars |first=Steve |last=Ladurantaye |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/canadian-firm-caught-up-in-wiki-wars/article1830732/ |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |location =Toronto |date=8 December 2010 |accessdate=9 December 2010}}</ref> . 

===Verification of submissions===. 
WikiLeaks states that it has never released a misattributed document. Documents are assessed before release. In response to concerns about the possibility of misleading or fraudulent leaks, WikiLeaks has stated that misleading leaks "are already well-placed in the mainstream media. WikiLeaks is of no additional assistance."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Trapido |first=Michael |title=Wikileaks: Is Julian Assange a hero, villain or simply dangerously naïve? |url=http://www.newstime.co.za/WorldNews/Wikileaks_:_Is_Julian_Assange_a_hero_villain_or_simply_dangerously_na%C3%AFve/16065/ |accessdate=18 December 2010 |newspaper=NewsTime |location =Johannesburg |date=1 December 2010}}</ref> The FAQ states that: "The simplest and most effective countermeasure is a worldwide community of informed users and editors who can scrutinise and discuss leaked documents."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wikileaks.org/faq-en |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070701115958/http://wikileaks.org/faq-en |archivedate=1 July 2007 |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=WikiLeaks |accessdate=17 June 2010}}</ref> . 

According to statements by Assange in 2010, submitted documents are vetted by a group of five reviewers, with expertise in different fields such as language or programming, who also investigate the background of the leaker if his or her identity is known. <ref name="motherjones3">{{Cite news |url=http://motherjones.com/politics/2010/04/wikileaks-julian-assange-iraq-video?page=3 |title=Inside WikiLeaks' Leak Factory |work= Mother Jones |location =San Francisco |date= 6 April 2010 |accessdate=30 April 2010 |author= Kushner, David}}</ref> In that group, Assange has the final decision about the assessment of a document. <ref name=motherjones3/> . 

===Legal status===. 
====Legal background====. 
The legal status of WikiLeaks is complex. Assange considers WikiLeaks a whistleblower protection intermediary. Rather than leaking directly to the press, and fearing exposure and retribution, whistleblowers can leak to WikiLeaks, which then leaks to the press for them. <ref>{{Cite news |last=Light |first=Gilead |work=The Great Debate (blog) |publisher=Reuters |title=The WikiLeaks story and criminal liability under the espionage laws |date=26 August 2010 |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2010/08/26/the-wikileaks-story-and-criminal-liability-under-the-espionage-laws/ |accessdate=6 December 2010}}</ref> Its servers are located throughout Europe and are accessible from any uncensored web connection.

===Insurance file===. 
On 29 July 2010, WikiLeaks added a 1.4 GB "Insurance file" to the Afghan War Diary page. The file is [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] encrypted and has a [[SHA1]] checksum of "cce54d3a8af370213d23fcbfe8cddc8619a0734c". <ref name=wikileaks-insurance>{{cite web |url=http://wikileaks.org/wiki/Afghan_War_Diary,_2004-2010 |title=Afghan War Diary, 2004-2010 |publisher=WikiLeaks |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110723110642/http://wikileaks.org/wiki/Afghan_War_Diary,_2004-2010 |archivedate=23 July 2011 |deadurl=no |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref> There has been speculation that it was intended to serve as insurance in case the WikiLeaks website or its spokesman Julian Assange are incapacitated, upon which the [[passphrase]] could be published, similar to the concept of a [[dead man's switch]]. <ref name="wired_insurance">{{Cite news |last=Zetter |first=Kim |title=WikiLeaks Posts Mysterious 'Insurance' File |date =30 July 2010 |url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/07/wikileaks-insurance-file/ |work=Wired |location =New York |accessdate=31 July 2010}}</ref><ref name="telegraph_dns_insuranceaes">{{Cite news |first=Victoria |last=Ward |title=WikiLeaks website disconnected as US company withdraws support|date=3 December 2010 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/wikileaks/8178457/WikiLeaks-website-disconnected-as-US-company-withdraws-support.html |accessdate=3 December 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uhylLWl9 |archivedate=3 December 2010 |deadurl=no}}</ref> Following the first few days' release of the [[United States diplomatic cables leak|US diplomatic cables]] starting 28 November 2010, the US television broadcaster [[CBS]] predicted that "If anything happens to Assange or the website, a key will go out to unlock the files.

===Financing===. 
WikiLeaks is a non-profit organisation, largely supported by volunteers, and it is dependent on public donations. Its main financing methods include conventional [[Wire transfer|bank transfers]] and [[E-commerce payment system|online payment systems]]. Annual expenses have been estimated at about €200,000, mainly for servers and bureaucracy, but might reportedly reach €600,000 if work currently done by volunteers were paid for. <ref name="leakonomy"/>  . 

WikiLeaks lawyers often work pro bono, and in some cases legal support has been donated by media organisations such as the [[Associated Press]], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and the [[National Newspaper Publishers Association]]. <ref name="leakonomy"/> WikiLeaks only revenue stream is donations, but it has considered other options including an auction model to sell early access to documents. <ref name="leakonomy"/> In September 2011, Wikileaks began auctioning items on Ebay to raise funds, and Assange told an audience at Sydney's Festival of Dangerous Ideas that the organisation might not be able to survive.  . 

====Funding model====. 
The [[Wau Holland Foundation]] helps to process donations to WikiLeaks. In July 2010, the Foundation  stated that WikiLeaks was receiving no money for personnel costs, only for hardware, travelling and bandwidth. <ref name="techeye">{{Cite news |url=http://www.techeye.net/internet/wau-holland-foundation-sheds-light-on-wikileaks-donations#ixzz0td0dXhBx |title=Wau Holland Foundation sheds light on WikiLeaks donations&nbsp;– Hardware, ISP, travelling costs |work= TechEye.net |date=13 July 2010 |accessdate=1 August 2010 |author= Daly, John W.}}</ref> An article in [[TechEye]] stated: {{quote|As a charity accountable under German law, donations for WikiLeaks can be made to the foundation.

Lee]], who has done PR work for WikiLeaks with the press and on social networking sites. <ref name="Cook" /> . 

In 2010, WikiLeaks received €635,772.73 in PayPal donations, less €30,000 in PayPal fees, and €695,925.46 in bank transfers.  €500,988.89 of the sum was received in the month of December, primarily as bank transfers as PayPal suspended payments December 4.  €298,057.38 of the remainder was received in April. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://cryptome.org/0003/wl-finance-en.pdf|title="Project 04: Enduring freedom of information" Preliminary transparency report 2010|publisher=Wau-Holland-Stiftung (WHS) ''via'' [[Cryptome]] |date=26 April 2011}}</ref> . 

The [[Wau Holland Foundation]], one of the WikiLeaks' main funding channels, stated that they received more than €900,000  in public donations between October 2009 and December 2010, out of which €370,000 has been passed on to WikiLeaks. Hendrik Fulda, vice president of the Wau Holland Foundation, mentioned that the Foundation had been receiving twice as many donations through [[PayPal]] as through normal banks, before PayPal's decision to suspend WikiLeaks' account. He also noted that every new WikiLeaks publication brought "a wave of support", and that donations were strongest in the weeks after  WikiLeaks started publishing leaked diplomatic cables. <ref>{{Cite news |title='Donations Were Never as Strong as Now' |work= Spiegel International |location=Hamburg |date=13 December 2010 |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,734318,00.html |accessdate=15 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Financing WikiLeaks|first= Scott |last=Horton |newspaper=Harper's Magazine |location =New York |date=6 August 2010 |url=http://www.harpers.org/archive/2010/08/hbc-90007485 |accessdate=15 December 2010}}</ref>  .

After the release of the [[12 July 2007 Baghdad airstrike|2007 airstrikes video]] and as they prepared to release film of the [[Granai airstrike]], Julian Assange has said that his group of volunteers came under intense surveillance. In an interview and Twitter posts he said that a restaurant in [[Reykjavík]] where his group of volunteers met came under surveillance in March; that there was "covert following and hidden photography" by police and foreign [[intelligence agency|intelligence services]]; that an apparent British intelligence agent made thinly veiled threats in a Luxembourg car park; and that one of the volunteers was detained by police for 21 hours.

In August 2009, [[Kaupthing Bank]] secured a court order preventing Iceland's national broadcaster, [[RÚV]], from broadcasting a risk analysis report showing the bank's substantial exposure to debt default risk. This information had been leaked by a whistleblower to WikiLeaks and remained available on the WikiLeaks site; faced with an injunction minutes before broadcast, the channel ran with a screen grab of the WikiLeaks site instead of the scheduled piece on the bank.

===Response from financial industry=== . 

Since the publications of CableGate, WikiLeaks has faced an unprecedented global financial blockade by  major finance companies including Mastercard, Visa and PayPal.  . 

In October 2010, it was reported that [[Moneybookers]], which collected donations for WikiLeaks, had ended its relationship with the site. Moneybookers stated that its decision had been made "to comply with money laundering or other investigations conducted by government authorities, agencies or commissions."<ref name="moneybookers">{{Cite news

On 18 December 2010, [[Bank of America]] announced it would "not process transactions of any type that we have reason to believe are intended for Wikileaks," citing "Wikileaks might be engaged in activities ... inconsistent with our internal policies for processing payments". WikiLeaks responded in a tweet by encouraging their supporters who were BoA customers to close their accounts.

Late in 2010, Bank of America approached the law firm of [[Hunton & Williams]] to put a stop to WikiLeaks. Hunton & Williams assembled a group of security specialists, [[HBGary Federal]], [[Palantir Technologies]], and [[Berico Technologies]]. They decided upon a campaign that included the use of  "false documents, disinformation, and sabotage."{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} . 

During 5 and 6 February 2011, [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] hacked HBGary's web site, copied tens of thousands of documents from HBGary, posted tens of thousands of company emails online, and usurped Barr's Twitter account in [[revenge]]. Some of the documents taken by Anonymous show HBGary Federal was working on behalf of [[Bank of America]] to respond to WikiLeaks' planned release of the bank's internal documents.  Emails detailed a supposed business proposal by HBGary to assist Bank of America's law firm, [[Hunton & Williams]], and revealed that the companies were willing to break the law to bring down WikiLeaks and Anonymous. 
<blockquote>
"CEO Aaron Barr thought he'd uncovered the hackers' identities and like rats, they'd scurry for cover. If he could nail them, he could cover up the crimes H&W, HBGary, and BoA planned, bring down WikiLeaks, [[Decapitation#metaphoric|decapitate]] Anonymous, and place his opponents in prison while collecting a cool fee.

==Spin-offs==. 
Releases of US diplomatic cables inspired the creation of a number of other organisations based on the WikiLeaks model. <ref>{{Cite news |author=Piven, Ben |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2010/12/20101216194828514847.html |title=Copycat WikiLeaks sites make waves&nbsp;– Features |work=Al Jazeera English |date=17 December 2010 |accessdate=18 December 2010}}</ref>
*[[OpenLeaks]] was created by a former WikiLeaks spokesperson. [[Daniel Domscheit-Berg]] said the intention was to be more transparent than WikiLeaks. OpenLeaks was supposed to start public operations in early 2011 but despite much media coverage it is still not functioning. 
*In December 2011, Wikileaks launched ''Friends of Wikileaks'', a social network for supporters and founders of the platform. <ref>[http://www.netzwelt.de/news/89988-wikileaks-enthuellungsplattform-gruendet-soziales-netzwerk.html Wikileaks launches Social Network]</ref>[https://wlfriends.org/ Official Website of Friends of Wikileaks]
*Brussels Leaks was focused on the European Union as a collaborative effort of media professionals and activists that sought to "pull the shady inner workings of the EU system out into the public domain. This is about getting important information out there, not about Brusselsleaks [or any other 'leaks' for that matter]."
*TradeLeaks was created to "do to trade and commerce what WikiLeaks has done to politics." It was founded by Australian Ruslan Kogan. Its goal is to ensure "individuals and businesses should attain values from others through mutually beneficial and fully consensual trade, rather than force, fraud or deception." Unfortunately the site itself appears to have become discounted by its users, as evidenced by the highest rated article being "Tradeleaks tampering with leak vote count mechanism". 
*Balkan Leaks was founded by Bulgarian Atanas Chobanov in order to make the [[Balkans]] more transparent and to fight corruption as "There are plenty of people out there that want to change the Balkans for good and are ready to take on the challenge. We're offering them a hand."
*Indoleaks is an [[Bahasa Indonesia|Indonesian]] site that seeks to publish classified documents primarily from the Indonesian government. 
*RuLeaks is aimed at being a Russian equivalent to WikiLeaks. It was originally launched to provide translated versions of the WikiLeaks cables but the ''[[Moscow Times]]'' reports it has started to publish its own content as well. <ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/russias-own-wikileaks-takes-off/429370.html |title=Russia's Own WikiLeaks Takes Off |author=Razumovskaya, Olga |work=The Moscow Times |date=21 January 2011 |accessdate=21 January 2011}}</ref>
*PPLeaks and PSOELeaks are related to the Spanish [[People's Party (Spain)|Partido Popular]] and [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]] leaks and scandals. 
*Leakymails is a project designed to obtain and publish relevant documents exposing corruption of the political class and the powerful in [[Argentina]]. <ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2011/08/argentina-judge-orders-all-isps-to-block-corruption-reporting-website/ |title=Argentina: Judge orders all ISPs to block corruption reporting website  |date=11 August 2011 |accessdate=11 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://opennet.net/blog/2011/08/argentina-judge-orders-all-isps-block-sites-leakymailscom-and-leakymailsblogspotcom/ |title=Argentina: Judge orders all ISPs to block the sites LeakyMails.com and Leakymails.blogspot.com|date=11 August 2011 |accessdate=11 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/08/argentina-isps-ip-overblocking|title=Argentine ISPs Use Bazooka to Kill Fly|date 19 August 2011 |accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref>
