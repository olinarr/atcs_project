'''Targeted killing''' is the [[assassination|intentional killing]], by a government or its agents, of a civilian or "[[unlawful combatant]]" targeted by the government, who is not in the government's custody.  The target is a person who is allegedly taking part in an armed conflict or terrorism, whether by bearing arms or otherwise, who has thereby lost the immunity from being targeted that he would otherwise have under the [[Third Geneva Convention]]. <ref name="google1"/> Note that this is a different term and concept from that of "targeted violence" as used by specialists who study [[violence]].  . 

On the one hand, in the legal world, [[Georgetown University Law Center|Georgetown Law]] Professor [[Gary D. Solis|Gary Solis]], in his 2010 book entitled ''The Law of Armed Conflict: International Humanitarian Law in War'',<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=6FKf0ocxEPAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Law+of+Armed+Conflict:+International+Humanitarian+Law+in+War&hl=en&ei=KXz_S522EIOclgfB-8n6CQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false</ref>  writes: "Assassinations and targeted killings are very different acts". <ref name="google1"/>  The use of the term assassination is opposed, as it denotes [[murder]], whereas people who are allegedly terrorists are targeted in self-defense, and thus it is viewed as a killing, but not a crime. <ref name="HOV">''[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/03/26/EDGK65QPC41.DTL Targeted killing is a necessary option]'', Sofaer, Abraham D., [[Hoover Institution]], March 26, 2004</ref>  
Judge [[Abraham D. Sofaer|Abraham Sofaer]], former federal judge for the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]], wrote on the subject: . 

<blockquote>When people call a targeted killing an "assassination," they are attempting to preclude debate on the merits of the action. Assassination is widely defined as murder, and is for that reason prohibited in the United States.... U.S. officials may not kill people merely because their policies are seen as detrimental to our interests.... But killings in self-defense are no more "assassinations" in international affairs than they are murders when undertaken by our police forces against domestic killers. Targeted killings in self-defense have been authoritatively determined by the federal government to fall outside the assassination prohibition. <ref name="sfgate2004"/></blockquote> . 

In ''The Impact of 9/11 and the New Legal Landscape: The Day That Changed Everything?'',<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=QP1Bq7HVQtwC&dq=The+Impact+of+9/11+and+the+New+Legal+Landscape:+The+Day+That+Changed+Everything&source=gbs_navlinks_s</ref>  the point is made that "There is a major difference between assassination and targeted killing.... targeted killing [is] not synonymous with assassination.

David|Steve David]], [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] Associate Dean & Professor of International Relations, writes:  "there are strong reasons to believe that the Israeli policy of targeted killing is not the same as assassination", [[Syracuse University College of Law|Syracuse Law]] Professor William Banks and [[George Washington University Law School|GW Law]] Professor Peter Raven-Hansen write:  "Targeted killing of terrorists is ... not unlawful and would not constitute assassination", Rory Miller writes:  "Targeted killing ... is not 'assassination'", and Associate Professor Eric Patterson and Teresa Casale write: "Perhaps most important is the legal distinction between targeted killing and assassination". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/cwrint36&div=20&id=&page=|author=[[Amos Guiora]] |title=Targeted Killing as Active Self-Defense |publisher=36 Case W.

On the other hand, the American Civil Liberties Union also states in its website, "A program of targeted killing far from any battlefield, without charge or trial, violates the constitutional guarantee of due process. It also violates international law, under which lethal force may be used outside armed conflict zones only as a last resort to prevent imminent threats, when non-lethal means are not available. Targeting people who are suspected of terrorism for execution, far from any war zone, turns the whole world into a battlefield." <ref> http://www.aclu.org/national-security/frequently-asked-questions-about-targeting-killing </ref>
Yael Stein, the  research director of B’Tselem, The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, also states in her article "By Any Name Illegal and Immoral: Response to 'Israel's Policy of Targeted Killing'":
<blockquote>The argument that this policy affords the public a sense of revenge and retribution could serve to justify acts both illegal and immoral. Clearly, lawbreakers ought to be punished. Yet, no matter how horrific their deeds, as the targeting of Israeli civilians indeed is, they should be punished according to the law. David’s arguments could, in principle, justify the abolition of formal legal systems altogether. </blockquote><ref> url=http://www.carnegiecouncil.org/resources/journal/17_1/debate/860.html </ref>
Ibrahim Nafie, writing in Egypt's ''[[Al-Ahram Weekly]]'' in 2001, criticized the U.S. for agreeing with "the Israeli spin that calls ... its official policy of assassinating Palestinian leaders 'targeted killing.'"<ref>{{cite web|author=Ibrahim Nafie |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/557/op1.htm |title=Opinion &#124; The very model of a rogue state |publisher=Al-Ahram Weekly  |date=October 31, 2001 |accessdate=May 20, 2010}}</ref> .
