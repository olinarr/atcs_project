{{censorship by country}} . 

Laws on '''censorship in Israel''' are based on British [[Defence (Emergency) Regulations|emergency regulations from 1945]] that apply to domestic media, foreign newspapers and wire service transmissions from or through [[Israel]].  . 

The Israeli Film Ratings board rates, limits or bans films deemed obscene, racist, or containing incitement to violence. <ref name=filmcensor>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEFD6143DF933A2575BC0A96F948260  Israeli Theater Gets A Censor-Free Run]</ref> Only a handful of films or plays have been banned outright (plays are no longer censored as of 1989). News censorship is the responsibility of the [[Israeli Military Censor]]. Regulations do not require all articles to be submitted for censorship prior to publication, but only those on a known list of sensitive subjects, such as [[nuclear weapons]] in Israel (for example, articles on the subjects of politics or economics may be published un-submitted). Failing to do so may cause the reporter to be cut off<ref name=NYTimes>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE3DD123BF93AA15755C0A964948260 New York Times: Censorship by Israel: How It's Carried Out]</ref> or, in the case of foreign reporters, be barred from the country. <ref name=BBCsorry>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,1435973,00.html The Guardian: BBC says sorry to Israel]</ref> . 

The list of sensitive subjects, articles on which have to be submitted to censorship prior to publication, is determined within the framework of a censorship agreement between Israeli authorities and the 'Editor's Committee', which is a body of representatives from the Israeli media. "There will be no censorship on political issues, on expressions of opinion or assessments, unless they hint on classified information." <ref name=agreement>[[Israeli Military Censor#The_Censorship_Agreement|The Censorship Agreement]]</ref> . 

[[Reporters Without Borders]] 2007 report on Israel states: "The country's journalists enjoy a freedom not found elsewhere in the region, but though 2006 was one of the safest years for them since the start of the second Intifada in 2000, many problems remain", mainly referring to the physical risks endured by reporters covering the conflict areas between Israel, the [[Palestinians]] and the [[Hizbullah]] in [[Lebanon]]. <ref name=repborders>[http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=43 Reporters Without Borders - Middle East Section]</ref>  . 

The [[Israeli Military Censor]] has the power to prevent publication of certain news items. The censorship rules largely concern military issues such as not reporting if a missile hit or missed its target, troop movements, etc. but it is also empowered to control information about the oil industry and water supply. <ref>[http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&code=FEU20060728&articleId=2845 Global Research: Israel's military censorship and war reporting in Lebanon]</ref><ref name=USDoS>[US Department of State: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices  - 2006]</ref> Journalists who bypass the military censor or publish items that were censored may be subject to criminal prosecution and jail time; the censor also has the authority to close newspapers. However, these extreme measures have been rarely used. <ref name=EaP>[http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002876486 Editor & Publisher: AP Reveals Israeli Censorship, Says It Will Abide By Rules]</ref> One notable instance where a newspaper was closed temporarily was in the case of the [[Kav 300 affair]] where it was eventually discovered that the censor was used by the [[Shin Bet]] to cover up internal wrongdoings in the agency and led to one of the biggest public scandals in Israel during the 1980s.  Following the incident the two main papers, [[HaAretz]] and [[Yediot Ahronot]] stopped participating in the "Editor's committee".   . 

In 1996 a new agreement was reached and the editor's committee resumed operation. The new agreement allowed military censorship only of articles clearly harmful to national security and allowed the supreme court to override military decisions.  . 

Israeli laws also outlaw [[hate speech]] and "expressing support for illegal or terrorist organizations". <ref name=USDoS/>  . 

[[Mordechai Vanunu]] who served 18 years in prison for treason and espionage was released in 2004, but is still under restrictions on speech and movement. <ref name=USDoS/> A BBC reporter was barred from the country after publishing an interview with him without handing it over to the censors first. <ref name=BBCsorry/> . 

Every journalist working within Israel is required to be accredited by the Israeli Government Press Office.  Most applications are just formal, but the office is allowed to deny applications based on political or security considerations. <ref name=USDoS/> . 

One very commonly used way for Israeli media to circumvent censorship rules is to leak items to foreign news sources, which by virtue of being located outside of Israel are not subject to Israeli censorship. Once published, the Israeli media can simply quote the story. <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bsos.umd.edu/pgsd/people/staffpubs/Avner-BASreport7-01.htm|title= Israel: Censoring the past|author= Aluf Benn|date= July/August 2001 |work= Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, College of Behavioral and Social Sciences|publisher= University of Maryland |accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref>

In 1960 two science fiction stories were published that circumvented censorship.  The first was about [[Rudolf Teichmann]] and told the story of [[Eichmann's kidnapping]]. [[Uri Avnery]]'s [[HaOlam Hazeh]] magazine published a story about the [[Lavon Affair]].  . 

In addition to media censorship, Israeli cinemas are subject to regulation regarding the exhibition of pornography and television stations face restrictions on early broadcasting of programs that are unsuitable for children.  . 

Israel has banned the use of the word [[Nakba]] in Israeli Arab schools and textbooks.  Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] justified the ban by saying that the term was "propaganda against Israel". <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSLM2389 |title=Israel bans "catastrophe" term from Arab schools |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=2009-07-22}}</ref> .
