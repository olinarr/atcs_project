[[File:Guy Fawkes by Cruikshank.jpg|thumb|240px|A 19th century illustration of [[Guy Fawkes]] by [[George Cruikshank]]. Guy Fawkes tried to assassinate [[James I of England]]. He failed and was convicted of treason and sentenced to be [[hanged, drawn and quartered]].]] . 

In [[law]], '''treason''' is the [[crime]] that covers some of the more extreme acts against one's [[sovereignty|sovereign]] or [[nation]]. Historically, treason also covered the murder of specific social superiors, such as the murder of a husband by his wife. Treason against the king was known as [[high treason]] and treason against a lesser superior was [[petty treason]]. A person who commits treason is known in law as a '''traitor'''.  . 

''Oran's Dictionary of the Law'' (1983) defines treason as "...[a]...[[citizenship|citizen]]'s actions to help a foreign [[government]] overthrow, make [[war]] against, or seriously injure the [parent nation]." In many nations, it is also often considered treason to attempt or conspire to overthrow the government, even if no foreign country is aided or involved by such an endeavour.  . 

Outside legal spheres, the word "'''traitor'''" may also be used to describe a person who [[Betrayal|betrays]] (or is accused of betraying) their own [[political party]], [[nation]], [[family]], [[friend]]s, [[ethnic group]], [[team]], [[religion]], [[social class]], or other group to which they may belong. Often, such accusations are controversial and disputed, as the person may not identify with the group of which they are a member, or may otherwise disagree with the group leaders making the charge. See, for example, [[race traitor]].  . 

At times, the term "traitor" has been levelled as a political [[epithet]], regardless of any verifiable treasonable action. In a [[civil war]] or [[insurrection]], the winners may deem the losers to be traitors. Likewise the term "traitor" is used in heated political discussion{{spaced ndash}}typically as a [[term of disparagement|slur]] against [[political dissent|political dissidents]], or against officials in power who are perceived as failing to act in the best interest of their constituents. In certain cases, as with the [[Germany|German]] ''[[Dolchstoßlegende]]'', the accusation of treason towards a large group of people can be a unifying political message.  . 

In [[English law]], [[high treason]] was punishable by being [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] (men) or [[execution by burning|burnt at the stake]] (women), or [[Decapitation|beheading]] (royalty and nobility). Treason was the only crime which attracted those penalties (until they were abolished in 1814, 1790 and 1973 respectively). <ref>[[Treason Act 1814]]. </ref> The penalty was used by later monarchs against people who could reasonably be called traitors, although most modern jurists would call it excessive. Many of them would now just be considered [[dissident]]s.  . 

In [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[King Lear]]'' (circa 1600), when the King learns that his daughter [[Regan (King Lear)|Regan]] has publicly dishonoured him, he says ''They could not, would not do 't; 'tis worse than murder'': a conventional attitude at that time. In [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy|Inferno]]'', the ninth and lowest circle of [[Hell]] is reserved for traitors; [[Judas Iscariot]], who betrayed [[Jesus]], suffers the worst torments of all: being constantly gnawed at by one of Lucifer's own three mouths. His treachery is considered so notorious that his name has long been synonymous with ''traitor'', a fate he shares with [[Benedict Arnold]], [[Marcus Junius Brutus]] (who too is depicted in Dante's ''Inferno'', suffering the same fate as Judas along with [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius Longinus]]), and [[Vidkun Quisling]]. Indeed, the [[etymology]] of the word ''traitor'' originates with Judas' handing over of Jesus to the Roman authorities: the word is derived from the Latin ''[[traditor]]'' which means "one who delivers."<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=traitor Online Etymology Dictionary]</ref>
Christian theology and political thinking until after [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]] considered treason and [[blasphemy]] as synonymous, as it challenged both the state and the will of God. Kings were considered chosen by God and to betray one's country was to do the work of Satan.

===Australia===. 
Section 80.1 of the Criminal Code, contained in the schedule of the [[Australian]] Criminal Code Act 1995,<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cca1995115/sch1.html Austlii.edu.au]</ref> defines treason as follows:
:"A person commits an offence, called treason, if the person:
::(a) causes the death of the Sovereign, the heir apparent of the Sovereign, the consort of the Sovereign, the Governor-General or the Prime Minister; or
::(b) causes harm to the Sovereign, the Governor-General or the Prime Minister resulting in the death of the Sovereign, the Governor-General or the Prime Minister; or
::(c) causes harm to the Sovereign, the Governor-General or the Prime Minister, or imprisons or restrains the Sovereign, the Governor-General or the Prime Minister; or
::(d) levies war, or does any act preparatory to levying war, against the Commonwealth; or
::(e) engages in conduct that assists by any means whatever, with intent to assist, an enemy:
:::(i) at war with the Commonwealth, whether or not the existence of a state of war has been declared; and
:::(ii) specified by Proclamation made for the purpose of this paragraph to be an enemy at war with the Commonwealth; or
::(f) engages in conduct that assists by any means whatever, with intent to assist:
:::(i) another country; or
:::(ii) an organisation;
::that is engaged in armed hostilities against the Australian Defence Force; or
::(g) instigates a person who is not an Australian citizen to make an armed invasion of the Commonwealth or a Territory of the Commonwealth; or
::(h) forms an intention to do any act referred to in a preceding paragraph and manifests that intention by an [[overt act]]." . 

A person is not guilty of treason under paragraphs (e), (f) or (h) if their assistance or intended assistance is purely humanitarian in nature.  . 

The maximum penalty for treason is [[life imprisonment]]. Section 24AA <ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca191482/s24aa.html Section 24AA]</ref> of the [[Crimes Act 1914]] creates the related offence of [[treachery]].  . 

====New South Wales==== . 

The [[Treason Act 1351]], the [[Treason Act 1795]] and the [[Treason Act 1817]] form part of the law of [[New South Wales]]. The [[Treason Act 1795]] and the [[Treason Act 1817]] have been repealed by section 11 <ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s11.html section 11]</ref> of the [[Crimes Act 1900]], except in so far as they relate to the compassing, imagining, inventing, devising, or intending death or destruction, or any bodily harm tending to death or destruction, maim, or wounding, imprisonment, or restraint of the person of the heirs and successors of [[King George III of the United Kingdom]], and the expressing, uttering, or declaring of such compassings, imaginations, inventions, devices, or intentions, or any of them.  . 

Section 12 <ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s12.html Section 12]</ref> of the [[Crimes Act 1900]] (NSW) creates an offence which is derived from section 3 of the [[Treason Felony Act 1848]]: . 

{{cquote|12 Compassing etc deposition of the Sovereign—overawing Parliament etc . 

Whosoever, within New South Wales or without, compasses, imagines, invents, devises, or intends to deprive or depose Our Most Gracious Lady the Queen, her heirs or successors, from the style, honour, or Royal name of the Imperial Crown of the United Kingdom, or of any other of Her Majesty's dominions and countries, or to levy war against Her Majesty, her heirs or successors, within any part of the United Kingdom, or any other of Her Majesty's dominions, in order, by force or constraint, to compel her or them to change her or their measures or counsels, or in order to put any force or constraint upon, or in order to intimidate or overawe, both Houses or either House of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, or the Parliament of New South Wales, or to move or stir any foreigner or stranger with force to invade the United Kingdom, or any other of Her Majesty's dominions, or countries under the obeisance of Her Majesty, her heirs or successors, and expresses, utters, or declares such compassings, imaginations, inventions, devices, or intentions, or any of them, by publishing any printing or writing, or by open and advised speaking, or by any overt act or deed, shall be liable to imprisonment for 25 years.}} . 

Section 16 <ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s16.html Section 16]</ref> provides that nothing in Part 2 repeals or affects anything enacted by the [[Treason Act 1351]] (25 Edw.3 c. 2). This section reproduces section 6 of the [[Treason Felony Act 1848]].  . 

====Victoria====. 
The offence of treason was created by section 9A(1)] <ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/ca195882/s9a.html section 9A(1)]</ref> of the Crimes Act 1958.  . 

=== Brazil ===. 
According to [[Brazilian law]], treason is the crime of disloyalty by a citizen to the [[Federal Republic of Brazil]], applying to combatants of the Brazilian military forces. Treason during warfare is the only crime for which a person can be sentenced to death ''(see [[capital punishment in Brazil]])''.  . 

The only military person in the [[history of Brazil]] to be convicted of treason was [[Carlos Lamarca]], an army captain who deserted to become the leader of a left-wing guerrilla against the [[Brazilian military dictatorship|military dictatorship]].  . 

===Canada===. 
Section 46 <ref>[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cs/C-46///en?page=1 Section 46]</ref> of the [[Criminal Code of Canada]] has two degrees of treason, called "high treason" and "treason." However, both of these belong to the historical category of [[high treason]], as opposed to [[petty treason]] which does not exist in Canadian law. Section 46 reads as follows:
:"High treason
:(1) Every one commits high treason who, in Canada,
::(a) kills or attempts to kill Her Majesty, or does her any bodily harm tending to death or destruction, maims or wounds her, or imprisons or restrains her;
::(b) levies war against Canada or does any act preparatory thereto; or
::(c) assists an enemy at war with Canada, or any armed forces against whom Canadian Forces are engaged in hostilities, whether or not a state of war exists between Canada and the country whose forces they are. 
:Treason
:(2) Every one commits treason who, in Canada,
::(a) uses force or violence for the purpose of overthrowing the government of Canada or a province;
::(b) without lawful authority, communicates or makes available to an agent of a state other than Canada, military or scientific information or any sketch, plan, model, article, note or document of a military or scientific character that he knows or ought to know may be used by that state for a purpose prejudicial to the safety or defence of Canada;
::(c) conspires with any person to commit high treason or to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a);
::(d) forms an intention to do anything that is high treason or that is mentioned in paragraph (a) and manifests that intention by an overt act; or
::(e) conspires with any person to do anything mentioned in paragraph (b) or forms an intention to do anything mentioned in paragraph (b) and manifests that intention by an overt act." . 

It is also illegal for a Canadian citizen to do any of the above outside Canada.  . 

The penalty for high treason is life imprisonment. The penalty for treason is imprisonment up to a maximum of life, or up to 14 years for conduct under subsection (2)(b) or (e) in peacetime.  . 

===France===. 
Article 411-1 <ref>[http://195.83.177.9/code/liste.phtml?lang=uk&c=33&r=3778 Article 411-1]</ref> of the French Penal Code defines treason as follows:
:"The acts defined by articles 411-2 to 411-11 constitute treason where they are committed by a French national or a soldier in the service of France, and constitute espionage where they are committed by any other person." . 

Article 411-2 prohibits "handing over troops belonging to the French armed forces, or all or part of the national territory, to a foreign power, to a foreign organisation or to an organisation under foreign control, or to their agents". It is punishable by life imprisonment and a fine of [[Euro|€]]750,000. Generally parole is not available until 18 years of a life sentence have elapsed. <ref>[http://195.83.177.9/code/liste.phtml?lang=uk&c=33&r=3650 195.83.177.9]</ref> . 

Articles 411-3 to 411-10 define various other crimes of collaboration with the enemy, sabotage, and the like. These are punishable with imprisonment for between thirty and seven years. Article 411-11 make it a crime to incite any of the above crimes.  . 

Besides treason and espionage, there are many other crimes dealing with national security, insurrection, terrorism and so on. These are all to be found in Book IV of the Code.  . 

=== Hong Kong===. 
Section 2 of the Crime Ordinance provides that levying war against the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, conspiring to do so, instigating a foreigner to invade Hong Kong, or assisting any public enemy at war with the Central People's Government, is treason, punishable with [[life imprisonment]]. <ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/CURALLENGDOC/E16492924C32B508C8256483003220EE?OpenDocument Cap 200 s 2]</ref><ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/B505654FA2FD062B4825647A00339D10/AA8F1D14B8B1011C4825650C00330F54?OpenDocument Cap 2601 s 6]</ref> . 

===Germany===. 
The German law differentiates between two types of treason: "High treason" (''Hochverrat'') and "treason" (''Landesverrat''). The high treason, defined in the Section 81<ref>[http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/StGB.htm#BIii Iuscomp.org]</ref> of the [[Law of Germany|German criminal code]] is defined as a violent attempt against the existence or the constitutional order of the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], carrying a penalty of life imprisonment or a fixed term of at least ten years. In less serious cases, the penalty is 1–10 years in prison. The German criminal law also criminalizes the high treason against a German state. Preparation of both types of the crime is criminal and carries a penalty of up to five years.  . 

The other type of treason, ''Landesverrat'' is defined in Section 94. <ref>[http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/StGB.htm#BII Iuscomp.org]</ref> This is basically the crime of [[espionage]]. The crime carries a penalty of one to five years in prison. However, in especially severe cases, life imprisonment or any term of at least of five years may be sentenced.  . 

===Ireland===. 
{{main|Treason in the Republic of Ireland}}
Article 39 of the [[Constitution of Ireland]] (adopted in 1937) states:<ref>[http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/upload/static/256.htm Constitution of Ireland] Department of the Taoiseach</ref>
:treason shall consist only in levying war against the State, or assisting any State or person or inciting or conspiring with any person to levy war against the State, or attempting by force of arms or other violent means to overthrow the organs of government established by the Constitution, or taking part or being concerned in or inciting or conspiring with any person to make or to take part or be concerned in any such attempt.  . 

The [[Treason Act 1939]] gave legislative effect to Article 39, and provided for the imposition of the death penalty for treason. <ref name="ie19390010">[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1939/en/act/pub/0010/index.html Treason Act 1939] Irish Statute Book</ref> The Criminal Justice Act 1990 [[capital punishment in the Republic of Ireland#Abolition|abolished the death penalty]], setting the punishment for treason at life imprisonment, with parole in not less than forty years. <ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0016/index.html Criminal Justice Act, 1990] Irish Statute Book</ref> No person has been charged under the Treason Act.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} [[Irish republican legitimatism|Irish republican legitimatists]] who refuse to recognise the legitimacy of the [[Republic of Ireland]] have been charged with lesser crimes under the [[Offences against the State Acts 1939–1998]].  . 

===Italy===. 
The [[Italy|Italian]] law defines various types of crimes that could be generally described as 'treason', although they are so many and so precisely defined that no one of them is simply called ''tradimento'' in the text of ''Codice Penale'' (Italian Criminal Code). The treason-type crimes are grouped as ''Crimes against the personhood of the State'' ('Crimini contro la personalità dello Stato') in the Second Book, First Title, of the Criminal Code.  . 

Articles 241 to 274 detail crimes against the ''international personhood of the State'' such as ''Attempt against wholeness, independence and unity of the State'' (art.241), ''Hostilities against a foreign State bringing the Italian State in danger of war'' (art.244), ''Bribery of a citizen by a foreigner against the national interests'' (art.246), ''Political or military espionage'' (art.257).  . 

Articles 276 to 292 detail crimes against the ''domestic personhood of the State'', ranging from ''Attempt on the President of the Republic'' (art.271), ''Attempt with purposes of terrorism or of subversion'' (art.280), ''Attempt against the Constitution'' (art.283), ''Armed insurrection against the power of the State'' (art.284), ''Civil war'' (art.286).  . 

Further articles detail other crimes, especially those of conspiracy, such as ''Political conspiracy through association'' (art.305), or ''Armed association: creating and participating'' (art.306).  . 

The penalties for treason-type crimes, before 1948, included death as maximum penalty, and, for some crimes, as the only penalty possible. Nowadays the maximum penalty is life in jail (''ergastolo'').  . 

===New Zealand===. 
[[New Zealand]] has treason laws that are stipulated under the [[Crimes Act 1961]]. Section 73 of the Crimes Act reads as follows:
:"Every one owing allegiance to [[Elizabeth II of New Zealand|Her Majesty the Queen]] [[Monarchy in New Zealand|in right of New Zealand]] commits treason who, within or outside New Zealand,—
::(a) Kills or wounds or does grievous bodily harm to Her Majesty the Queen, or imprisons or restrains her; or
::(b) Levies war against New Zealand; or
::(c) Assists an enemy at war with New Zealand, or any armed forces against which New Zealand forces are engaged in hostilities, whether or not a state of war exists between New Zealand and any other country; or
::(d) Incites or assists any person with force to invade New Zealand; or
::(e) Uses force for the purpose of overthrowing the [[Government of New Zealand]]; or
::(f) Conspires with any person to do anything mentioned in this section." <ref>[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM328520.html#DLM328520 Crimes Act 1961 – Section 73]</ref> . 

The penalty is life imprisonment, except that the maximum for conspiracy is 14 years. Treason was the last [[Capital punishment in New Zealand|capital crime]] in New Zealand law, with the death penalty not being revoked until 1989, years after it was abolished for [[murder]].  . 

Very few people have been prosecuted for the act of treason in New Zealand and none have been prosecuted in recent years. <ref>[http://www.justice.govt.nz/pubs/reports/2004/oaths-review/part_d.htm#2.2%20%20%20%20%20Matters%20to%20consider Justice.govt.nz]</ref> . 

===Russia===. 
Article 275 of the [[Criminal Code of Russia]]. <ref>[http://www.russian-criminal-code.com/PartII/SectionX/Chapter29.html Russian-criminal-code.com]</ref> defines treason as "espionage, disclosure of state secrets, or any other assistance rendered to a foreign State, a foreign organization, or their representatives in hostile activities to the detriment of the external security of the [[Russian Federation]], committed by a citizen of the Russian Federation." The sentence is imprisonment for 12 to 20 years. It is not a capital offence, even though murder and some aggravated forms of attempted murder are (although Russia currently has a moratorium on the death penalty). Subsequent sections provide for further offences against state security, such as armed rebellion and forcible seizure of power.  . 

===Sweden===. 
Sweden's treason laws have seen little application in modern times. The most recent case was in 2001. Four teenagers (their names were not reported) were convicted of treason after they  assaulted [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|King Carl Gustaf]] with a cream pie. The ringleader was fined 100 days' income; the others were fined 80 days' income. <ref>{{cite web|title=Swedish Tart Attack was Treason|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2001-12-03/world/sweden.treason_1_treason-cream-cake-royal-visit}}</ref> . 

===Switzerland===. 
There is no single crime of treason in [[Swiss law]]; instead, multiple criminal prohibitions apply. Article 265 of the [[Strafgesetzbuch (Switzerland)|Swiss Criminal Code]] prohibits "[[high treason]]" (''Hochverrat/haute trahison'') as follows:
:"Whoever commits an act with the objective of violently
:– changing the [[Swiss Federal Constitution|constitution of the Confederation]] or of a [[Swiss cantons|canton]],
:– removing the constitutional authorities of the state from office or making them unable to exercise their authority,
:– separating Swiss territory from the Confederation or territory from a canton,
:shall be punished with imprisonment of no less than a year." . 

A separate crime is defined in article 267 as "diplomatic treason" (''Diplomatischer Landesverrat/Trahison diplomatique''):
:"1. Whoever makes known or accessible a secret, the preservation of which is required in the interest of the Confederation, to a foreign state or its agents, (...) shall be punished with imprisonment of no less than a year. 
:2. Whoever makes known or accessible a secret, the preservation of which is required in the interest of the Confederation, to the public, shall be punished with imprisonment of up to five years or a monetary penalty." . 

In 1950, in the context of the [[Cold War]], the following prohibition of "foreign enterprises against the security of Switzerland" was introduced as article 266<sup>bis</sup>:
:"<sup>1</sup> Whoever, with the purpose of inciting or supporting foreign enterprises aimed against the security of Switzerland, enters into contact with a foreign state or with foreign parties or other foreign organizations or their agents, or makes or disseminates untrue or tendentious claims (''unwahre oder entstellende Behauptungen / informations inexactes ou tendancieuses''), shall be punished with imprisonment of up to five years or a monetary penalty. 
:<sup>2</sup> In grave cases the judge may pronounce a sentence of imprisonment of no less than a month." . 

The criminal code also prohibits, among other acts, the suppression or falsification of legal documents or evidence relevant to the international relations of Switzerland (art. 267, imprisonment of no less than a year) and attacks against the independence of Switzerland and incitement of a war against Switzerland (art. 266, up to life imprisonment).  . 

The Swiss military criminal code contains additional prohibitions under the general title of "treason", which also apply to civilians, or which in times of war civilians are also (or may by executive decision be made) subject to. These include [[espionage]] or transmission of secrets to a foreign power (art. 86); [[sabotage]] (art. 86a); "military treason", i.e., the disruption of activities of military significance (art. 87); acting as a [[franc-tireur]] (art. 88); disruption of military action by disseminating untrue information (art. 89); military service against Switzerland by Swiss nationals (art. 90); or giving aid to the enemy (art. 91). The penalties for these crimes vary, but include life imprisonment in some cases.  . 

===Turkey===. 
Treason ''per se'' is not defined in the Turkish Penal Code. However, the law defines crimes which are traditionally included in the scope of treason, such as cooperating with the enemy during wartime. Treason is punishable by imprisonment up to life.  . 

===United Kingdom===. 
{{Main|High treason in the United Kingdom}}
{{See also|Petty treason|Treason felony}}
[[File:Execution of thomas armstrong 1683.jpg|right|thumb|250px|upright|Engraving depicting the execution of [[Sir Thomas Armstrong]] in 1684, from [[Hanged, drawn and quartered]].]] . 

The British law of treason is entirely [[statutory]] and has been so since the [[Treason Act 1351]] (25 Edw. 3 St. 5 c. 2). The Act is written in [[Anglo-Norman language|Norman French]], but is more commonly cited in its English translation.  . 

The Treason Act 1351 has since been amended several times, and currently provides for four categories of treasonable offences, namely: . 

<blockquote>
* "when a man doth compass or imagine the death of our lord the King, or of our lady his Queen or of their eldest son and heir";
* "if a man do violate the King’s companion, or the King’s eldest daughter unmarried, or the wife of the King’s eldest son and heir";<ref>As was widely pointed out in the press at the time, if the allegations that [[James Hewitt]] had an affair with [[Princess Diana]] whilst she was married to [[Prince Charles]] had been substantiated, it would have amounted to the crime of treason. [http://www.iht.com/articles/1994/10/05/royale.php IHT.com] Queens consort [[Anne Boleyn]], [[Catherine Howard]] and [[Caroline of Brunswick]] were prosecuted for treasonable adultery. </ref>
* "if a man do levy war against our lord the King in his realm, or be adherent to the King’s enemies in his realm, giving to them aid and comfort in the realm, or elsewhere"; and
* "if a man slea the [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor]], treasurer, or the King’s justices of the one bench or the other, justices in eyre, or justices of assise, and all other justices assigned to hear and determine, being in their places, doing their offices". 
</blockquote> . 

Another Act, the [[Treason Act 1702]] (1 Anne stat. 2 c. 21), provides for a fifth category of treason, namely: . 

<blockquote>
* "if any person or persons ... shall endeavour to deprive or hinder any person who shall be the next in succession to the crown ... from succeeding after the decease of her Majesty (whom God long preserve) to the imperial crown of this realm and the dominions and territories thereunto belonging". 
</blockquote> . 

By virtue of the [[Treason Act 1708]], the law of treason in [[Scotland]] is the same as the law in England, save that in Scotland the slaying of the [[Senator of the College of Justice|Lords of Session]] and [[Senator of the College of Justice|Lords of Justiciary]] and counterfeiting the [[Great Seal of Scotland]] remain treason under sections 11 and 12 of the Treason Act 1708 respectively. <ref>[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&Year=1708&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=1516341&ActiveTextDocId=1516341&filesize=18797 Statutelaw.gov.uk]</ref> Treason is a [[Reserved matters|reserved matter]] about which the [[Scottish Parliament]] is prohibited from legislating. Two acts of the former [[Parliament of Ireland]] passed in [[Treason Act (Ireland) 1537|1537]] and [[Crown of Ireland Act 1542|1542]] create further treasons which apply in [[Northern Ireland]].  . 

The [[Treason Act 1814|penalty for treason]] was changed from death to a maximum of imprisonment for life in 1998 under the Crime And Disorder Act. <ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980037_en_4#pt2-pb3-l1g36 Opsi.gov.uk]</ref> Before 1998, the death penalty was mandatory, subject to the [[pardon|royal prerogative of mercy]]. Since the abolition of the [[death penalty]] for murder in 1965 an execution for treason was unlikely to be carried out.  . 

Treason laws were used against Irish insurgents before [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Irish independence]]. However, [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] and other [[Irish republicanism|republican]] groups were not prosecuted or executed for treason for levying war against the British government during the [[Troubles]]. They, along with [[Ulster Loyalism|loyalist]] groups, were jailed for [[murder]], violent crimes or [[terrorist]] offences. [[William Joyce]] was the last person to be put to death for treason, in 1946. (On the following day [[Theodore Schurch]] was executed for [[Treachery Act 1940|treachery]], a similar crime, and was the last man to be executed for a crime other than murder in the UK.) . 

As to who can commit treason, it depends on the ancient notion of [[allegiance]]. As such, all [[British national]]s (but not other [[Commonwealth citizen]]s) owe allegiance to the Queen in right of the United Kingdom wherever they may be, as do Commonwealth citizens and aliens present in the United Kingdom at the time of the treasonable act (except diplomats and foreign invading forces), those who hold a British passport however obtained, and aliens who – having lived in Britain and gone abroad again – have left behind family and belongings.  . 

====International influence====. 
The [[Treason Act 1695]] enacted, among other things, a rule that treason could be proved only in a trial by the evidence of two witnesses to the same offence. Nearly one hundred years later this rule was incorporated into the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]], which requires two witnesses to the same overt act. It also provided for a three year time limit on bringing prosecutions for treason (except for assassinating the king), another rule which has been imitated in some common law countries. The [[Sedition Act 1661]] made it treason to imprison, restrain or wound the king. Although this law was abolished in the United Kingdom in 1998, it still continues to apply in some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries.  . 

===United States===. 
====Federal====. 
To avoid the abuses of the English law (including executions by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] of those who criticized his repeated marriages), treason was specifically defined in the [[United States Constitution]], the only crime so defined. [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]] Section 3 delineates treason as follows:
[[Image:Iva Toguri mug shot.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Iva Toguri]], known as ''[[Tokyo Rose]]'', and [[Tomoya Kawakita]] were two Japanese Americans who were tried for treason after World War II.]]
<blockquote>Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court. <br />The Congress shall have Power to declare the Punishment of Treason, but no [[Attainder]] of Treason shall work [[Attainder#Corruption of blood|Corruption of Blood]], or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person attainted. </blockquote> . 

However, [[United States Congress|Congress]] has, at times, passed statutes creating related offenses that undermine the government or the national security, such as [[sedition]] in the 1798 [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], or [[espionage]] and [[sedition]] in the 1917 [[Espionage Act]], which do not require the testimony of two witnesses and have a much broader definition than Article Three treason. For example, some well-known spies have been convicted of espionage rather than treason.  . 

The Constitution does not itself create the offense; it only restricts the definition (the first paragraph), permits Congress to create the offense, and restricts any punishment for treason to only the convicted (the second paragraph). The crime is prohibited by legislation passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]]. Therefore the [[United States Code]] at {{usc|18|2381}} states "whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States." The requirement of testimony of two witnesses was inherited from the British [[Treason Act 1695]].  . 

One of American history's most notorious traitors is [[Benedict Arnold]], whose name is considered synonymous with the definition of traitor due to his collaboration with the British during the War of Independence. However, this occurred before the Constitution was written. Since the Constitution came into effect, there have been fewer than 40 federal prosecutions for treason and even fewer convictions. Several men were convicted of treason in connection with the 1794 [[Whiskey Rebellion]] but were pardoned by President [[George Washington]]. The most famous treason trial, that of [[Aaron Burr]] in 1807 (See [[Burr conspiracy]]), resulted in acquittal. Politically motivated attempts to convict opponents of the [[Embargo Act of 1807|Jeffersonian Embargo Acts]] and the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]] all failed. After the [[American Civil War]], no person involved with the [[Confederate States of America]] was tried for treason, though a number of leading Confederates (including [[Jefferson Davis]] and [[Robert E. Lee]]) were indicted. Those who had been indicted received a blanket amnesty issued by President [[Andrew Johnson]] as he left office in 1869.  . 

The [[Cold War]] saw frequent associations between treason and support for (or insufficient hostility toward) [[Communist]]-backed causes. The most memorable of these came from Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]], who accused the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Harry S. Truman]] administrations of "twenty years of treason." As chosen chair of the [[United States Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations|Senate Permanent Investigations Subcommittee]], McCarthy also investigated various government agencies for [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spy rings; however, he acted as a political fact-finder rather than a criminal prosecutor. The Cold War period saw few prosecutions for treason. On October 11, 2006, a federal grand jury issued the first indictment for treason against the United States since 1952, charging [[Adam Yahiye Gadahn]] for videos in which he appeared as a spokesman for [[al-Qaeda]] and threatened attacks on American soil. <ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,219861,00.html American to Be Indicted for Treason], Fox News, October 12, 2006</ref> . 

====State====. 
Most states have provisions in their constitutions or statutes similar to those in the U.S. Constitution. The [[Extradition Clause]] specifically defines treason as an extraditable offense. There have been only two documented prosecutions for treason on the state level, that of [[Thomas Dorr]] for treason against the state of [[Rhode Island]] for his part in the [[Dorr Rebellion]], and that of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] for treason against the state of [[Virginia]] for his part in the [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|raid on Harpers Ferry]]. In [[1859]], he and a few of his sons infiltrated [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]]—a military base in Virginia—in an attempt to steal the weapons that were kept there. His goal was to give these weapons to slaves, and lead them in an armed rebellion, but his attempt was unsuccessful. His sons were killed in the ensuing battle, and he was captured, and then tried, and convicted, for treason against the Commonwealth of Virginia. He was sentenced to [[death penalty|death]] by [[hanging]], which was performed on December 2, 1859. <ref>{{cite web | title = John Brown, Fanatical Abolitionist Whose Raid at Harpers Ferry Led to Civil War | url = http://history1800s.about.com/od/americanoriginals/p/johnbrownbio.htm }}</ref> . 

===Muslim countries===. 
Early in [[Islamic history]], the only form of treason was seen as the attempt to overthrow a just government or waging war against the State. According to Arab tradition, the prescribed punishment ranged from imprisonment to the severing of limbs and the death penalty depending on the severity of the crime. However, even in cases of treason the repentance of a person would have to be taken into account. <ref>[http://alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=244&region=EN AlIslam.org]</ref> . 

Currently, the consensus among major Islamic schools is that [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy]] (leaving Islam) is considered treason and that the penalty is death; this is supported not in the [[Quran]] but in the [[Hadith]]. <ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/mar/20/afghanistan.islam Guardian.co.uk]</ref><ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-500087/Imams-daughter-hiding-conversion-Christianity-sparked-death-threats.html DailyMail.co.uk]</ref><ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,188903,00.html FoxNews.com]</ref><ref>[http://freecopts.net/english/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=998&Itemid=9 FreeCopts.net]</ref><ref>[http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&art=10161 AsiaNews.it]</ref><ref>[http://www.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=5062 Frontpagemag.com]</ref> This confusion between apostasy and treason almost certainly had its roots in the [[Ridda Wars]], in which an army of rebel traitors led by the self-proclaimed prophet [[Musaylima]] attempted to destroy the [[caliphate]] of [[Abu Bakr]].  . 

In the nineteenth and early twentieth century, the Iranian Cleric [[Sheikh Fazlollah Noori]] opposed the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]] by inciting insurrection against them through issuing Fatwahs and publishing pamphlets arguing democracy will bring vice to the country. The new government executed him for treason in 1909.  . 

In [[Malaysia]], it is treason to commit offences against the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]]’s person, waging, attempting to wage war or abetting the waging of war against the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]], a Ruler or [[Yang di-Pertua Negeri]]. All these offences are punishable by hanging, which derives from the English treason acts (a former British colony, Malaysia's legal system is based on English [[common law]]).  . 

====Algeria====. 
In Algeria, treason is defined as the following:
* attempts to change the regime or actions aimed at incitement
* destruction of territory, sabotage to public and economic utilities
* participation in armed bands or ''in insurrectionary movements'' . 

====Bahrain====. 
In [[Bahrain]], plotting to topple the regime, collaborating with a foreign hostile country and threatening the life of the Emir are defined as treason and punishable by death. The [[State Security Law of 1974]] was used to crush dissent that could be seen as treasonous, which was criticised for permitting severe human rights violations in accordance with Article One: . 

<blockquote>
"If there is serious evidence that a person has perpetrated acts, delivered statements, exercised activities, or has been involved in contacts inside or outside the country, which are of a nature considered to be in violation of the internal or external security of the country, the religious and national interests of the State, its social or economic system; or considered to be an act of sedition that affects or can possibly affect the existing relations between the people and Government, between the various institutions of the State, between the classes of the people, or between those who work in corporations propagating subversive propaganda or disseminating atheistic principles; the Minister of Interior may order the arrest of that person, committing him to one of Bahrain's prisons, searching him, his residence and the place of his work, and may take any measure which he deems necessary for gathering evidence and completing investigations. 
<br>
"The period of detention may not exceed three years. Searches may only be made and the measures provided for in the first paragraph may only be taken upon judicial writ."
</blockquote> . 

====Iran====. 
In [[Iran]] every act of disloyalty is considered high treason, even expressing one's mind against the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]]. Acting against the military forces or police forces is also treason because they are arguably loyal to the supreme leader. Most judges{{who|date=December 2011}} are careful with the death sentence if the crime is considered a disloyalty to the supreme leader because every sentence lower than death sentence is not acceptable.  . 

After a presidential election in which people started to oppose the government and country leaders, courts have been a lot more sensitive about the crime of treason in order to keep better control of the situation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} . 

====Palestinian territories====. 
In the areas controlled by the [[Palestinian National Authority]], it is treason to give assistance to Israeli troops without the authorization of the Palestinian Authority or to sell land to Jews (irrespective of nationality) and also non-Jewish Israeli citizens under the [[Palestinian Land Laws]], as part of the PA's general policy of discouraging the expansion of [[Israeli settlement]]s. Both crimes are capital offences subject to the [[death penalty]], although the former provision has not often been enforced since the beginning of effective security cooperation between the [[Israel Defense Forces]], [[Israel Police]], and [[Palestinian National Security Forces]] since the mid-2000s under the leadership of Prime Minister [[Salam Fayyad]]. Likewise, in the [[Gaza Strip]] under the [[Hamas]] led government, any sort of cooperation or assistance to Israeli forces during military actions is also punishable by death.  .
