[[File:Whistleblowing.pdf|thumb|right|250px|[[Federal Government of the United States]]'s whistleblower awareness poster]] . 

A '''whistleblower''' ('''whistle-blower''' or '''whistle blower''')<ref>[http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/whistleblower Yahoo Education]</ref> is a person who tells the public or someone in authority about alleged dishonest or illegal activities ([[misconduct]]) occurring in a government department, a public or private organization, or a company. The alleged misconduct may be classified in many ways; for example, a violation of a [[law]], rule, regulation and/or a direct threat to [[public interest]], such as [[fraud]], health/safety violations, and [[political corruption|corruption]]. Whistleblowers may make their allegations internally (for example, to other people within the accused organization) or externally (to regulators, law enforcement agencies, to the media or to groups concerned with the issues).  . 

One of the first laws that protected whistleblowers was the 1863 United States [[False Claims Act]] (revised in 1986), which tried to combat fraud by suppliers of the United States government during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The act encourages whistleblowers by promising them a percentage of the money recovered or damages won by the government and protects them from wrongful dismissal. <ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/whistleblower Answers.com]</ref> . 

Whistleblowers frequently face [[reprisal]], sometimes at the hands of the organization or group which they have accused, sometimes from related organizations, and sometimes under law.

==Overview==. 
===Origin of term===. 
The term ''whistleblower'' comes from the [[whistle]] a referee uses to indicate an illegal or foul play. <ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=whistleblower+&searchmode=none Etymonline.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.wordorigins.org/index.php/site/whistleblower/ Wordorigins.org]</ref> US civic activist [[Ralph Nader]] coined the phrase in the early 1970s to avoid the negative connotations found in other words such as "informers" and "snitches". <ref>[Nader, Petkas, and Blackwell, Whistleblowing (1972).]</ref> . 

===Definition===. 
[[File:Płk Ryszard Kukliński.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Ryszard Kukliński]] believed that he would be able to prevent the war in Europe between the [[Warsaw Pact]] and [[NATO]] countries by handling in 40,265 pages of secret military documents of [[German Democratic Republic]] and [[People's Republic of Poland]] to CIA in the [[Federal Republic of Germany]]]]
Most whistleblowers are ''internal whistleblowers'', who report misconduct on a fellow employee or superior within their company. One of the most interesting questions with respect to internal whistleblowers is why and under what circumstances people will either act on the spot to stop illegal and otherwise unacceptable behavior or report it. <ref>Dealing with—or reporting—"unacceptable" behavior (with additional thoughts about the "Bystander Effect") Mary Rowe MIT, Linda Wilcox HMS, Howard Gadlin NIH (2009), ''Journal of the International Ombudsman Association'' 2(1), online at [http://www.ombudsassociation.org/publications/journal/ ombudsassociation.org]</ref> There is some reason to believe that people are more likely to take action with respect to unacceptable behavior, within an organization, if there are [[complaint systems]] that offer not just options dictated by the planning and control organization, but a ''choice'' of options for individ absolute confidentiality. <ref>Mary Rowe, "Options and choice for conflict resolution in the workplace" in ''Negotiation: Strategies for Mutual Gain'', by Lavinia Hall (ed.), Sage Publications, Inc., 1993, pp. 105–119. </ref> . 

''External whistleblowers'', however, report misconduct on outside persons or entities. In these cases, depending on the information's severity and nature, whistleblowers may report the misconduct to [[lawyer]]s, the [[Mass media|media]], [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] or [[consumer protection|watchdog agencies]], or other local, state, or federal agencies. In some cases, external whistleblowing is encouraged by offering monetary reward.  . 

Under most US federal whistleblower statutes, in order to be considered a whistleblower, the federal employee must have reason to believe his or her employer has violated some law, rule or regulation; testify or commence a legal proceeding on the legally protected matter; or refuse to violate the law.  . 

In cases where whistleblowing on a specified topic is protected by statute, US courts have generally held that such whistleblowers are protected from retaliation. <ref>[http://www.oalj.dol.gov/PUBLIC/WHISTLEBLOWER/REFERENCES/REFERENCE_WORKS/EDIG12.HTM DOL.gov]</ref> However, a closely divided [[US Supreme Court]] decision, [[Garcetti v. Ceballos]] (2006) held that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] [[free speech]] guarantees for government employees do not protect disclosures made within the scope of the employees' duties.  . 

===Common reactions===. 
Ideas about whistleblowing vary widely. Whistleblowers are commonly seen as selfless [[martyr]]s for public interest and organizational [[accountability]]; others view them as "tattle tales" or "snitches," solely pursuing personal glory and fame. Some academics (such as [[Thomas Alured Faunce]]) feel that whistleblowers should at least be entitled to a rebuttable presumption that they are attempting to apply ethical principles in the face of obstacles and that whistleblowing would be more respected in governance systems if it had a firmer academic basis in [[virtue ethics]]. <ref>Faunce, T.A. "Developing and Teaching the Virtue-Ethics Foundations of Healthcare Whistle Blowing", ''Monash Bioethics Review''. 2004; 23(4): 41–55</ref><ref>Faunce, T.A. and Jefferys, S. "Whistleblowing and scientific misconduct: Renewing legal and virtue ethics foundations". ''Journal of Medicine and Law'' 2007, '''26(3)''': 567–84. </ref> . 

It is probable that many people do not even consider blowing the whistle, not only because of fear of retaliation, but also because of fear of losing their relationships at work and outside work. <ref>Rowe, Mary & Bendersky, Corinne, "Workplace Justice, Zero Tolerance and Zero Barriers: Getting People to Come Forward in Conflict Management Systems," in ''Negotiations and Change, From the Workplace to Society'', Thomas Kochan and Richard Locke (eds), [[Cornell University Press]], 2002. See also "Dealing with — or Reporting — 'Unacceptable' Behavior (With additional thoughts about the 'Bystander Effect')" ©2009Mary Rowe MIT, Linda Wilcox HMS, Howard Gadlin NIH, ''Journal of the International Ombudsman Association'' 2(1), online at [http://www.ombudsassociation.org/publications/journal/ ombudsassociation.org]</ref> . 

Because the majority of cases are very low-profile and receive little or no media attention and because whistleblowers who do report significant misconduct are usually put in some form of danger or [[persecution]], the idea of seeking fame and glory may be less commonly believed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} . 

''Persecution of whistleblowers'' has become a serious issue in many parts of the world. Although whistleblowers are often protected under law from employer retaliation, there have been many cases where punishment for whistleblowing has occurred, such as [[termination of employment|termination]], [[suspension (punishment)|suspension]], [[demotion]], [[wage garnishment]], and/or harsh [[mistreatment]] by other employees. For example, in the United States, most whistleblower protection laws provide for limited "make whole" remedies or damages for employment losses if whistleblower retaliation is proven. However, many whistleblowers report there exists a widespread "[[shoot the messenger]]" mentality by corporations or government agencies accused of misconduct and in some cases whistleblowers have been subjected to criminal prosecution in reprisal for reporting wrongdoing.  . 

As a reaction to this many private organizations have formed whistleblower [[legal defense fund]]s or support groups to assist whistleblowers; two such examples are the ''National Whistleblowers Center''<ref>[http://www.whistleblowers.org/ whistleblowers.org]</ref> in the [[United States]] and ''Public Concern at Work''<ref>[http://www.pcaw.co.uk pcaw.co.uk]</ref> in the [[UK]]. Depending on the circumstances, it is not uncommon for whistleblowers to be ostracized by their co-workers, discriminated against by future potential employers, or even fired from their organization. This campaign directed at whistleblowers with the goal of eliminating them from the organization is referred to as [[mobbing]]. It is an extreme form of [[workplace bullying]] wherein the group is set against the targeted individual. a
whistle blower act have great effect for protection of people.  . 

==Legal protection== . 

Legal protection for whistleblowing varies from country to country and may depend on any of the country of the original activity, where and how secrets were revealed, and how they eventually became published or publicized. Over a dozen countries have now adopted comprehensive whistleblower protection laws which create mechanisms for reporting, investigate reports, and provide legal protections to the people who informed them. Over 50 countries have adopted more limited protections as part of their anti-corruption, freedom of information, or employment laws. <ref>Banisar, "Whistleblowing: International Standards and Developments", in CORRUPTION AND TRANSPARENCY: DEBATING THE FRONTIERS BETWEEN STATE, MARKET AND SOCIETY, I. Sandoval, ed., World Bank-Institute for Social Research, UNAM, Washington, D.C., 2011 available online at [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1753180]. </ref> ''For purposes of the English Wikipedia, this section emphasizes the English-speaking world and covers other regimes only insofar as they represent exceptionally greater or lesser protections.'' . 

===USA===. 
{{main|Whistleblower protection in the United States}}
Whistleblowing is complex patchwork of contradictory laws within the US.  . 

In the United States, legal protections vary according to the subject matter of the whistleblowing, and sometimes the state in which the case arises. <ref>[http://www.peer.org/state/index.php Peer.org]</ref> In passing the 2002 [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]], the Senate Judiciary Committee found that whistleblower protections were dependent on the "patchwork and vagaries" of varying state statutes. <ref>Congressional Record p. S7412; S. Rep. No. 107–146, 107th Cong., 2d Session 19 (2002). </ref> Still, a wide variety of federal and state laws protect employees who call attention to violations, help with enforcement proceedings, or refuse to obey unlawful directions.  . 

The first US law adopted specifically to protect whistleblowers was the 1863 United States [[False Claims Act]] (revised in 1986), which tried to combat fraud by suppliers of the United States government during the Civil War. The act encourages whistleblowers by promising them a percentage of the money recovered or damages won by the government and protects them from wrongful dismissal. <ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/whistleblower Answers.com]</ref> . 

Another US law that specifically protects whistleblowers is the [[Lloyd – La Follette Act]] of 1912. It guaranteed the right of federal employees to furnish information to the [[United States Congress]]. The first US environmental law to include an employee protection was the [[Clean Water Act]] of 1972. Similar protections were included in subsequent federal environmental laws, including the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] (1974), [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (1976), [[Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976]], [[Energy Reorganization Act of 1974]] (through 1978 amendment to protect nuclear whistleblowers), [[Superfund|Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA, or the Superfund Law)]] (1980), and the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] (1990). Similar employee protections enforced through OSHA are included in the [[Surface Transportation Assistance Act]] (1982) to protect truck drivers, the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act (PSIA) of 2002, the [[Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century]] ("AIR 21"), and the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, enacted on July 30, 2002 (for corporate fraud whistleblowers).  . 

Investigation of retaliation against whistleblowers under 20 federal statutes falls under the jurisdiction of the Office of the Whistleblower Protection Program<ref>[http://www.whistleblowers.gov Whistleblowers.gov]</ref> of the [[United States Department of Labor|United States Department of Labor's]]<ref>[http://www.dol.gov DOL.gov]</ref> Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). <ref>[http://www.osha.gov Osha.gov]</ref> New whistleblower statutes enacted by Congress which are to be enforced by the Secretary of Labor are generally delegated by a Secretary's Order<ref>[http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=FEDERAL_REGISTER&p_id=21749 Osha.gov]</ref> to OSHA's [[Office of the Whistleblower Protection Program]] (OWPP).  . 

The patchwork of laws means that victims of retaliation need to be alert to the laws at issue to determine the deadlines and means for making proper complaints. Some deadlines are as short as 10 days (for Arizona State Employees to file a "Prohibited Personnel Practice" Complaint before the Arizona State Personnel Board; and Ohio public employees to file appeals with the State Personnel Board of Review). It is 30 days for environmental whistleblowers to make a written complaint to the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA). Federal employees complaining of discrimination, retaliation or other violations of the civil rights laws have 45 days to make a written complaint to their agency's equal employment opportunity (EEO) officer. Airline workers and corporate fraud whistleblowers have 90 days to make their complaint to OSHA. Nuclear whistleblowers and truck drivers have 180 days to make complaints to OSHA. Victims of retaliation against union organizing and other concerted activities to improve working conditions have six months to make complaints to the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB). Private sector employees have either 180 or 300 days to make complaints to the federal [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (depending on whether their state has a "deferral" agency) for discrimination claims on the basis of race, gender, age, national origin or religion. Those who face retaliation for seeking minimum wages or overtime have either two or three years to file a civil lawsuit, depending on whether the court finds the violation was "willful." . 

Those who report a false claim against the federal government, and suffer adverse employment actions as a result, may have up to six years (depending on state law) to file a civil suit for remedies under the US [[False Claims Act]] (FCA). <ref>{{usc|31|3730}}(h)</ref> Under a ''[[qui tam]]'' provision, the "original source" for the report may be entitled to a percentage of what the government recovers from the offenders. However, the "original source" must also be the first to file a federal civil complaint for recovery of the federal funds fraudulently obtained, and must avoid publicizing the claim of fraud until the [[United States Department of Justice|US Justice Department]] decides whether to prosecute the claim itself. Such ''qui tam'' lawsuits must be filed under seal, using special procedures to keep the claim from becoming public until the federal government makes its decision on direct prosecution.  . 

Federal employees could benefit from the Whistleblower Protection Act,<ref>{{usc|5|1221}}(e)</ref> and the [[No-FEAR Act]] (which made individual agencies directly responsible for the economic sanctions of unlawful retaliation). Federal protections are enhanced in those few cases where the [[United States Office of Special Counsel|Office of Special Counsel]] will uphold the whistleblower's case.  . 

====Wall Street====. 
[[File:Whistle Blowers Occupy Wall Street 2011 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|A woman protesting the state of protections for whistleblowers of banking fraud at the [[Occupy Wall Street]] rally, September 17, 2011]]
[[Securities]] whistleblowers are provided incentives and protection by the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] (2010). <ref>{{cite web|url= http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?c111:6:./temp/~c11184fZpv:e1509382:|title=Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (2010) IX B Sec. 922|publisher= Library of Congress: Thomas|accessdate=2010-12-20}}</ref>
The Dodd-Frank Act offers whistleblowers significant incentives and increases protection for whistleblowers in the SEC whistleblower program. This legislation authorizes the SEC to reward those who provide information concerning violations of the federal securities laws at companies that are required to report to the SEC.  . 

Further, the Dodd-Frank Act strengthens the whistleblower protection provisions of the False Claims Act, and contains one of the strongest confidentiality provisions for whistleblowers ever enacted. For the first time, whistleblowers will be allowed to initially report fraud anonymously by filing a claim through an attorney.  . 

Additionally, the law prohibits employers from retaliating against whistleblowers. Employers may not fire, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or discriminate against a whistleblower. The Dodd-Frank Act expands the reach of whistleblower protections provided under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to include employees of public companies as well as employees of its private subsidiaries and affiliates. Whistleblowers who suffer from employment retaliation may sue for reinstatement, back pay, and any other damages incurred.  . 

====US military====. 
The Military Whistleblower Protection Act<ref>{{usc|10|1034}}</ref> protects the right of members of the armed services to communicate with any member of Congress (even if copies of the communication are sent to others).  . 

===UK===. 
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998]] provides a framework of legal protection for individuals who disclose information so as to expose malpractice and matters of similar concern. <ref>[http://report.globalintegrity.org Global Integrity Report]</ref> In the vernacular, it protects whistleblowers from [[victimization]] and dismissal.  . 

===Australia===. 
There is no national law on protection of whistleblowers in [[Australia]]. In 2011, the government promised to adopt a new law. There are also laws in a number of states. <ref>[See Whistleblowers Australia http://www.whistleblowers.org.au/]</ref> The former NSW Police Commissioner Tony Lauer summed it up as: "Nobody in Australia much likes whistleblowers, particularly in an organisation like the police or the government." . 

===Canada===. 
[[Canada|Canadian]] protection for whistleblowers is notoriously poor by English-speaking countries' standards. Until recently, there was no formal protection for those who spoke up from a position of knowledge inside government, with even senior civil servants ([[Shiv Chopra]] being one notable case) fired or constructively dismissed for speaking up about internal abuses.  . 

In the private sector, the situation was even worse as Canada retained the unreformed common law of [[libel]] without the exceptions for public issues or public interest that were added in all other English-speaking countries. This made [[political libel]] cases unfortunately common, with one infamous case even filed by the Prime Minister himself versus Official Opposition for alleging that the Prime Minister, when in Opposition, had bribed MP [[Chuck Cadman]].  . 

Historically, many Canadian private sector business scandals had come to light only through the intervention of the US SEC or other regulators ([[Garth Drabinsky]], [[Conrad Black]], [[Steven Bingham]] being three notable examples), due in part to the lack of whistleblower protections, plaintiff-friendly libel laws and a lack of investigative journalism due to these.  . 

====Canadian government====. 
Canada's parliament has instituted the [[Public Sector Integrity Commissioner|Public Sector Integrity Office (Canada)]], a parliamentary office for the protection for whistleblowers who speak up against abuses in government. However, that office was itself cast into some doubt when the first Integrity Commissioner, [[Christiane Ouimet]], was heavily criticized in the [[Auditor General of Canada|auditor general]]'s report in December 2010. <ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/12/09/auditor-general-integrity-commissioner.html CBC.ca]</ref><ref>[http://www.thestarphoenix.com/story_print.html?id=3960445&sponsor= Thestarphoenix.com]</ref> Cabinet minister [[Stockwell Day]] defended the office<ref>[http://hilltimes.com/page/view/integrity-10-25-2010 Hilltimes.com]</ref> but independent groups urged the re-opening of already closed files. <ref>[http://fairwhistleblower.ca/content/integrity-commissioner%E2%80%99s-office-urged-reopen-files Fairwhistleblower.ca]</ref><ref>[http://canadians4accountability.org/blog/2010/10/26/media-update-for-october-26-2010/ Canadians4accountability.org]</ref> . 

===Jamaica===. 
In [[Jamaica]], the Protected Disclosures Act, 2011 <ref>[http://www.japarliament.gov.jm/attachments/341_The%20Protected%20Disclosures%20Act,%202011.pdf]</ref> received assent in March 2011. It creates a comprehensive system for the protection of whistleblowers in the public and private sector. It is based on the UK's Public Interest Disclosure Act.  . 

===India===. 
The government of [[India]] has been considering adopting a whistleblower protection law for several years. In 2003, the Law Commission of India recommended the adoption of the Public Interest Disclosure (Protection of Informers) Act, 2002. <ref>[http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/reports/179rptp2.pdf]</ref>. In August 2010, the Public Interest Disclosure and Protection of Persons Making the Disclosures Bill, 2010 was introduced into the Parliament of India, [[Lok Sabha]]. <ref>The Public Interest Disclosure and Protection of Persons Making the Disclosures Bill, 2010 [http://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/postoftheday/PIDPPMDBill-2010.pdf]</ref>. The Bill was approved by the cabinet in June,2011.The Public Interest Disclosure and Protection of Persons Making the Disclosures Bill, 2010 was renamed as The Whistleblowers' Protection Bill, 2011 by the Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice. <ref> http://www.prsindia.org/uploads/media/Public%20Disclosure/Legislative%20Brief%20-%20Public%20Interest%20Disclosure%20Bil.pdf</ref>. The Whistleblowers' Protection Bill,2011 was passed by the lower house of Indian Parliament, [[Lok Sabha]] on 28 December 2011. <ref>[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2752946.ece Whistle-blowers Bill passed -The Hindu]</ref>.The Bill is however currently pending in the upper house of Parliament, Rajya Sabha for discussion & Further Passage. The Bill was introduced in Rajya Sabha on 29 March 2012 by [[ V._Narayanasamy]], Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs.  . 

===Ireland===. 
The government of [[Ireland]] committed to adopting a comprehensive whistleblower protection law in January 2012. The bill will reportedly cover both the public and private sectors. <REF>["Whistleblower Bill to cover public and private sectors", ''Irish Times'', 30 January 2011 [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/0130/1224310944604.html]]</ref> . 

===Other countries=== . 

There are also comprehensive laws in [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]]. A number of other countries have recently adopted comprehensive whistleblower laws including [[Ghana]], [[South Korea]], and [[Uganda]]. They are also being considered in [[Kenya]] and [[Rwanda]]. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in 2008 that whistleblowing was protected as freedom of expression. <ref>Guja v. Moldova, Application no. 14277/04 (2008)</ref> .

===Ceballos case and the Whistleblower Protection Act of 2007===. 
The [[US Supreme Court]] dealt what many considered a major blow to government whistleblowers when, in the case of [[Garcetti v. Ceballos]], 04-5, 547 US 410,<ref>[{{SCOTUS URL BoundVolume|547}} Garcetti v. Ceballos, 04-5, 547 US 410]</ref> it ruled that [[Civil service|government employees]] did not have protection from retaliation in performance evaluations by their employers under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the Constitution if the alleged speech was produced as part of his/her duties. <ref>[http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/05/30/national/w132119D75.DTL&type=politics High Court Trims Whistleblower Rights]</ref> Ceballos did not dispute that his memo was made as part of his official duties. Whistleblowers who want to pursue a federal case under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] must now always claim the memos and writings made are part not only of the official duty but of a citizen's opinion and discourse of public relevance. This can be done by alleging that the cause for retaliation is not the text of the memo but the ideas surrounding it. In the case of Ceballos he could have argued that his protected speech was his concept of strict adherence to the rule of law.  . 

The [[free speech]] protections of the First Amendment have long been used to shield whistleblowers from retaliation by whistleblower attorneys. In response to the Supreme Court decision, the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] passed H.R. 985, the [[Whistleblower Protection Act]] of 2007. President [[George W. Bush]], citing [[national security]] concerns, promised to [[veto]] the bill should it be enacted into law by Congress. The Senate's version of the Whistleblower Protection Act (S. 274), which has significant bipartisan support, was approved by the [[Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs]] on June 13, 2007. However, it has yet to reach a vote by Senate as a hold has been placed on the bill by Senator [[Tom Coburn]] (R-OK). <ref>[http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Whistleblower_Protection_Enhancement_Act_of_2007 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2007 – Congresspedia]</ref> According to the [[National Whistleblower Center]], Coburn's hold on S. 274 has been done to further President Bush's agenda. <ref>[http://www.capwiz.com/whistleblowers/issues/alert/?alertid=9904676 Take Action Now]</ref> . 

In December 2010 the Senate passed enhanced protections for government employees and contractors who report cases of waste, fraud and abuse. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/federal-eye/2010/12/senate_passes_whistleblower_pr.html?wprss=federal-eye |title=Senate passes whistleblower protection bill |publisher=''The Washington Post'' |accessdate=13 December 2010}}</ref> . 

===California False Claims Act===. 
The [[California]] False Claims Act protects whistleblowers from retaliation from their employer under a section entitled: "Section 12653. Employer interference with employee disclosures."<ref>[http://quitamguide.com/california-false-claims-act-12650-12655 California False Claims Act]</ref> Under this section, employers may not make rules that prevent an employee from disclosing information to the government in furtherance of a false claims action, an employer may not discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, deny promotion to, or in any other manner discriminate against, an employee in the terms and conditions of employment because he or she has disclosed information to the government.  . 

===Conscientious Employee Protection Act (CEPA)===. 
CEPA, [[New Jersey]]'s whistleblower law, prohibits an employer from taking any retaliatory action against an employee because the employee does any of the following:
* Discloses, or threatens to disclose, to a supervisor or to a public body an activity, policy, or practice of the employer or another employer, with whom there is a business relationship, that the employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, or a rule or regulation issued under the law, or, in the case of an employee who is a licensed or certified health care professional, reasonably believes constitutes improper quality of patient care;
* Provides information to, or testifies before, any public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation of law, or a rule or regulation issued under the law by the employer or another employer, with whom there is a business relationship, or, in the case of an employee who is a licensed or certified health care professional, provides information to, or testifies before, any public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into quality of patient care; or
* Objects to, or refuses to participate in, any activity, policy or practice which the employee reasonably believes: is in violation of a law, or a rule or regulation issued under the law, or, if the employee is a licensed or certified health care professional, constitutes improper quality of patient care; is fraudulent or criminal; or is incompatible with a clear mandate of public policy concerning the public health, safety or welfare or protection of the environment. <ref>N.J.S.A. 34:19–3</ref> . 

==="Concerning protection for health care workers who report patient safety information" in Colorado===. 
"Patient safety is of paramount importance in the delivery of health care to [[Colorado]] citizens. A patient is at his or her safest when a health care worker has the right to speak out on the patient's behalf without fear of reprisal or retaliation. Health care providers recognize that, in order to deliver the highest quality health care, it is imperative that all health care workers have the right to report patient safety concerns and to advocate for a patient's well being without the risk of disciplinary action or loss of employment."<ref>House Bill 07-1133.

===Medical residents and extending whistleblower protection to enforce safety, health, and maximum work hour standards===. 
Other proposals have been made to extend federal whistleblower protection to medical residents working at health care facilities, hospitals, and health care providers, as an internal means to ensure that certain patient hospital and health standards are being effectuated, including enforcing maximum hour guidelines for medical residents <ref> [http://open.wmitchell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1070&context=wmlr&sei-redir=1&referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3Dmedical%2520residents%2520whistleblower%2520protection%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D2%26ved%3D0CGIQFjAB%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fopen.wmitchell.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1070%2526context%253Dwmlr%26ei%3DMc0NT-25FaPy0gHlp9H0BQ%26usg%3DAFQjCNHfdcQ1oJI-5g27EWkk-0TC4sqE9A#search=%22medical%20residents%20whistleblower%20protection%22 Robert N.
