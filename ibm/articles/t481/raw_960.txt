'''Reporters Without Borders''' ('''RWB''') is a France-based international [[non-governmental organization]] that advocates [[freedom of the press]] and [[freedom of information]]. This organization, which has consultant status at the United Nations.,<ref name="en.rsf.org">{{cite web|url=http://en.rsf.org/introduction-24-03-2011,32617.html |title=Introduction - Reporters Without Borders |publisher=En.rsf.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-03}}</ref> was founded in 1985, by [[Robert Ménard]], Rony Brauman and the journalist Jean-Claude Guillebaud. <ref name=RFO>http://www.rfointernational.net/article245.html</ref> Jean-François Julliard has served as Secretary General since 2008. <ref name="LeFigaro_Menard_resigns">{{cite news | first= | last= | pages= | language =French | title=Robert Ménard "se passera très bien des médias" | date=2008-09-26  | publisher=[[Le Figaro]] | url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/medias/2008/09/26/04002-20080926ARTFIG00570-robert-menard-quitte-rsf-.php |accessdate=2008-12-24 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5dIFhRWa4 |archivedate=2008-12-23 }}</ref> English speakers also commonly refer to the organization by its French name, '''Reporters Sans Frontières''', or its French acronym, '''RSF'''. <ref>http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/1021/breaking36.htm</ref> Its head office is in the [[2nd arrondissement of Paris|2nd arrondissement]] of [[Paris]]. <ref>http://en.rsf.org/contact-us-24-04-2009,32615.html</ref>
According to its own mission statement, Reporters Without Borders 
* "defends journalists and media assistants imprisoned or persecuted for doing their job and exposes the mistreatment and torture of them in many countries. 
* fights against censorship and laws that undermine press freedom. 
* gives financial aid each year to 300 or so journalists or media outlets in difficulty (to pay for lawyers, medical care and equipment) as well to the families of imprisoned journalists. 
* works to improve the safety of journalists, especially those reporting in war zones.”<ref name="en.rsf.org"/> . 

==Press freedom==. 
RWB was founded in [[Montpellier]], [[France]], in 1985. At first, the association was aimed at promoting [[alternative journalism]], but before the failure of their project, the three founders stumbled on disagreements between themselves. <ref name=RFO/> Finally, only Robert Ménard stayed and became its Secretary General. Ménard changed the NGO's aim towards [[freedom of the press]]. <ref name=RFO/> . 

Reporters Without Borders states that it draws its inspiration from Article 19 of the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], according to which everyone has "the right to freedom of opinion and expression" and also the right to "seek, receive and impart" information and ideas "regardless of frontiers." This has been re-affirmed by several charters and declarations around the world. In Europe, this right is included in the 1950 [[European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms|Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]].  . 

Reporters Without Borders is a founding member of the [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]], a virtual network of non-governmental organizations that monitors free expression violations worldwide and defends journalists, writers and others who are persecuted for exercising their right to [[freedom of expression]].  . 

In 2005, Reporters Without Borders shared the [[European Parliament's]] [[Sakharov Prize]] for freedom of thought with Nigerian human rights lawyer [[Hauwa Ibrahim]] and Cuba's [[Ladies in White]] movement. <ref>http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/focus_page/008-1530-293-10-42-901-20051017FCS01528-20-10-2005-2005/default_en.htm</ref>
In 2009, Reporters Without Borders received the Roland Berger Prize for Human Dignity along with [[Shirin Ebadi]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://fr.rsf.org/le-prix-roland-berger-pour-la-25-03-2009,30678.html |title=Le Prix Roland Berger pour la dignité humaine est attribué à Reporters sans frontières et à Shirin Ebadi - Reporters sans frontières |publisher=Fr.rsf.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-03}}</ref> . 

===Methods of action=== . 

Through its correspondents, RWB conducts investigations of press freedom violations by region or topic, such as the Internet: it releases annual reports on each country as well as the [[Press Freedom Index]]. If necessary, it will send a team of its own to assess working conditions for journalists in a certain country. 
Reporters Without Borders’ primary means of direct action are appeals to government authorities through letters or petitions, as well as frequent press releases. Also, it has launched PR campaigns with the pro bono assistance of advertising firms to undermine the image of countries that it considers enemies of freedom of expression, and discourage political support by the international community. <ref name="en.rsf.org"/>  . 

RWB also provides assistance for journalists and media who are either in danger or in difficulty subsisting. They have given money to provide for the needs of exiled or imprisoned journalists and their families and the unsupported families of journalists who have been killed; to enable journalists to leave their home countries if they are in danger there; to repair the effects of vandalism on media outlets; to cover the legal fees of journalists who have been prosecuted for their writings or the medical bills of those who have been physically attacked; and on one occasion, to provide bullet-proof vests. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.rsf.org/reporters-without-borders-provides-13-07-2009,27495.html |title=Reporters Without Borders provides funding for journalists and media in danger - Reporters Without Borders |publisher=En.rsf.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-03}}</ref> . 

===Publications===. 
Over the years, RWB has published several books to raise public awareness of threats to press freedom  around the world. One such publication is the ''Handbook for Bloggers and Cyber-Dissidents'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=542 |title=Reporters sans frontières – Handbook for bloggers and cyber-dissidents |publisher=Rsf.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-03}}</ref> which was launched in September 2005 and updated in 2008. <ref>http://en.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/guide_gb_md-2.pdf</ref> The handbook provides technical tips on how to [[blog]] anonymously and avoid [[censorship]]. It includes contributions from well-known blogger-journalists [[Dan Gillmor]] and [[Ethan Zuckerman]]. 
RWB also releases materials intended for journalists concerning their safety or information on how to apply for political asylum. Such publications include a handbook for journalists who are working in dangerous areas such as war zones<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.rsf.org/handbook-for-journalists-january-17-04-2007,21744.html |title=Handbook for Journalists - January 2010 update - Reporters Without Borders |publisher=En.rsf.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-03}}</ref> and a set of directions on how to seek asylum in most Western countries<ref>http://en.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/RWB_guidelines_exiled_journalists-2.pdf</ref> . 

==Funding==. 
According to the annual accounts, its total budget is of €4,000,000, which is mostly financed by sale of photo-albums (of which the authors freely grant [[copyright]], and which are freely distributed by the ''[[Presstalis|Nouvelles Messageries de la Presse Parisienne]]'', or NMPP),<ref name=Fig/> as well as extras such as T-shirts, etc. <ref name=Fig/> . 

More than 20% of its funding comes from private groups, such as [[Sanofi-Aventis]] (€400,000, 10% of its budget),<ref name=Fig/> [[François Pinault]], the [[Fondation de France]], the [[Open Society Institute]] of [[George Soros]], the [[Sigrid Rausing Trust]], [[Benetton Group|Benetton]], or the [[Center for a Free Cuba]] (which donated €64,000 in 2002). <ref name=Fig/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=22503 |title=reporters sans frontières: liberté de la presse, contre la censure, information libre, défense des libertés |publisher=Rsf.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-03}}</ref> Furthermore, [[Saatchi & Saatchi]] has created various communication campaigns of RWB for free (for instance, concerning [[censorship in Algeria]]). <ref>http://dzairinfos.com/article/atteintes-a-la-liberte-de-la-presse-en-algerie</ref> . 

Some of its funding (12% of total in 2007) comes from governmental organisations. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=27672 |title=Income and expenditure |publisher=Rsf.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-03}}</ref> According to RWB president Robert Ménard, the donations from the French government account for 4.8% of RWB's budget; the total amount of governmental aid being 11% of its budget (including money from the French government, the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], [[UNESCO]] and the [[Organisation internationale de la francophonie]]). <ref name=Junqua/> Daniel Junqua, the vice-president of the French section of RWB (and also vice-president of the NGO ''Les Amis du [[Monde diplomatique]]''), states that the [[National Endowment for Democracy|NED]]'s funding, which reaches an amount of €35,000,<ref name=Fig>http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualites/2008/04/21/01001-20080421ARTFIG00365-revelations-surlefinancement-de-reporters-sans-frontieres.php</ref> does not compromise RWB's impartiality. <ref name=Junqua>http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2007/08/A/15044</ref> RWB's Chinese website credits support from [[Taiwan Foundation for Democracy]],<ref>http://www.rsf-chinese.org/spip.php?article59</ref> a quasi-government organization funded by the [[Republic of China|ROC]] Ministry of Foreign Affairs. <ref>http://www.tfd.org.tw/english/about.php?id=en0101</ref> . 

Reporters Without Borders books are sold by the French leisure chains and supermarkets Fnac, [[Carrefour]], Casino, Monoprix and Cora, the websites alapage.com, fnac.com and amazon.fr, as well as A2Presse and over 300 bookshops throughout France. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=27672|title=Income and expenditure|publisher=Reporters Without Borders|date=31 December 2007}}</ref> . 

Journalist [[Salim Lamrani]] has estimated that RWB would have to sell 170,200 books in 2004 and 188,400 books in 2005 to earn the more than $2&nbsp;million in the organisation's income statement. <ref name="cp2"/> In fact, Reporters Without Borders book sales were 230,000 in 2007. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.rsf.org/income-and-expenditure-30-06-2008,27672 |title="Income and expenditure", Reports Without Borders, June 30, 2008 |publisher=En.rsf.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-03}}</ref> . 

==Campaigns==. 
===Predators of Press Freedom===. 
Reporters Without Borders publishes the annual ''Predators of Press Freedom'' list which highlights what it feels are the worst violators. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=17545|title=Predators of Press Freedom|publisher=Reporters Without Borders}}</ref><ref>Artists [[Stephen Shanabrook]] and Veronika Georgieva with [[Saatchi and Saatchi]] for 25th anniversary campaign, 2010, for Reporters Without Borders [http://en.rsf.org/spip.php?page=article&id_article=37398 en.rsf.org], including tv commercial [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3TX_03Ta1Y youtube.com].

===World Day Against Cyber Censorship===. 
Reporters Without Borders launched the first International Online Free Expression Day on March 12, 2008. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=26017 |title=Reporters Without Borders – Launch of Online Free Expression Day |publisher=Rsf.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-03}}</ref>  Now named [[World Day Against Cyber Censorship]], this annual event rallies support for a single Internet without restrictions and accessible to all.  . 

====Enemies of the Internet list====. 
In conjunction with its World Day Against Cyber Censorship, RWB updates its ''Enemies of the Internet list'' which highlights what it considers the countries that are the worst violators of freedom of expression on the Internet. A second list of countries ''Under Surveillance'' is released at the same time. <ref>http://en.rsf.org/first-online-free-expression-day-12-03-2008,26086</ref> . 

===Philippines===. 
On August 23, 2007, RWB condemned the continuing threats and violence against [[Philippine]] radio commentators who report on organized crime and corruption, following a death threat on RGMA [[Palawan]] station manager Lily Uy. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/57296/Intl-groups-slam-attacks-against-broadcasters |title=GMA NEWS.TV, Int'l groups slam attacks against broadcasters |publisher=Gmanews.tv |date=2007-08-23 |accessdate=2012-03-03}}</ref> On December 27, 2007, RWB appealed to [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] administration to forthwith arrest the killers of radio broadcaster Ferdinand Lintuan, 51, the 5th journalist killed in 2007 in the Philippines. As first president of the Davao Association of Sports Journalists he was murdered in [[Davao City]] on December 24. <ref>[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=103599 Abs-Cbn Interactive, RWB calls for immediate arrest of Lintuan killers]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref> . 

===Beijing 2008 Olympics===. 
{{See also|Concerns and controversies over the 2008 Summer Olympics}} . 

Reporters Without Borders had been protesting the possibility of China hosting the 2008 Olympics since 2001. 
On March 30, 2008, the day the [[Olympic torch]] departed from Olympia, Greece, RWB president Robert Ménard unfurled behind Chinese representative Qi Liu a banner bearing a design resembling the logo of the Olympics, in which the Olympic rings were replaced with handcuffs. 
On April 7, 2008, the day the torch came to Paris, Ménard climbed with the help of two other activists to the top of Notre Dame Cathedral to hoist a banner with the same Olympic symbol. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.observatoire-humanitaire.org/fusion.php?l=GB&id=33 |title=Observatoire de l'action humanitaire |publisher=Observatoire-humanitaire.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-03}}</ref>
In one of RWB’s most popular campaigns to date, T-shirts bearing the symbol became so popular that sales for them surpassed 1 million euros. <ref name=Fig /> .

==Worldwide Press Freedom Index==. 
[[File:Reporters Without Borders 2009 Press Freedom Rankings Map.svg|500px|right|2009 press freedom rankings]]
{{Main|Press Freedom Index}} . 

RWB compiles and publishes an annual ranking of countries based upon the organization's assessment of their press freedom records. Small countries, such as [[Andorra]], are excluded from this report.  . 

The report is based on a questionnaire<ref>Reporters Without Borders. [http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=29011 2009 questionnaire]{{Dead link|date=January 2012}}</ref> sent to partner organizations of Reporters Without Borders (14 freedom of expression groups in five continents) and its 130 correspondents around the world, as well as to journalists, researchers, jurists and human rights activists. <ref>Reporters Without Borders. [http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=19391 How the index was compiled]</ref> . 

The survey asks questions about direct attacks on journalists and the media as well as other indirect sources of pressure against the free press. RWB is careful to note that the index only deals with press freedom, and does not measure the quality of journalism. Due to the nature of the survey's methodology based on individual perceptions, there are often wide contrasts in a country's ranking from year to year.  . 

==Criticisms of RWB==. 
===Robert Ménard on the ethics of torture===. 
In an interview with [[France Culture]] in 2007, whilst speaking about the case of the kidnapped journalist [[Daniel Pearl]], RWB president [[Robert Ménard]] discussed the ethics of [[torture]]. <ref name="rue89">Jean-Noël Darde, [http://rue89.com/2007/08/26/quand-robert-menard-de-rsf-legitime-la-torture Quand Robert Ménard, de RSF, légitime la torture], ''[[Rue 89]]'', 26 August 2007 {{fr icon}}</ref> Menard told France Culture: . 

{{quote|Where do we stop? Shall we accept this logic that consists of... since we could do it in some cases, 'you take him hostage, we take him hostage; you mistreat them, we mistreat them; you torture, we torture ...?  What is it that justifies... Can we go that far to free someone?<ref name="rue89"/>}} . 

===Otto Reich===. 
Lucie Morillon, RWB's then-Washington representative, confirmed in an interview on 29 April 2005 that the organization had a contract with US State Department's Special Envoy to the Western Hemisphere, [[Otto Reich]], who signed it in his capacity as a trustee for the [[Center for a Free Cuba]], to inform Europeans about the repression of journalists in Cuba. <ref name=RWBU>[http://www.counterpunch.org/barahona05172005.html Reporters Without Borders Unmasked], CounterPunch, 17 May 2005</ref> ''[[CounterPunch]]'', a critic of RWB, cited Reich's involvement with the group as a source of controversy: when Reich headed the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration's [[Office of Public Diplomacy]] in the 1980s, the body partook in what its officials termed "White Propaganda"&nbsp;– covert dissemination of information to influence domestic opinion regarding US backing for military campaigns against Left-wing governments in Latin America. <ref name=RWBU/> . 

===Cuba===. 
RWB has been highly critical of press freedom in Cuba, describing the Cuban government as "[[totalitarianism|totalitarian]]", and engages in [[Opposition to Fidel Castro|direct campaigning]] against it. <ref name="RSFChe">[http://www.cubanet.org/CNews/y04/mar04/12e5.htm Reporters Without Borders ordered to pay 6,000 euros to Korda's heir over use of Che photo], Cubanet.org, March 10, 2004</ref>  RWB's campaign includes declarations on radio and television, full-page ads in Parisian dailies, posters, leafletting at airports, and an April 2003 occupation of the Cuban tourism office in Paris. <ref name=RWBU/> A Paris court (''[[French law|tribunal de grande instance]]'') ordered RWB to pay 6,000 Euros to the daughter and heir of [[Alberto Korda]] for non-compliance with a court order of 9 July 2003 banning it from using Korda's famous (and [[copyright]]ed) photograph of [[Ernesto "Che" Guevara]] in a beret, taken at the funeral of [[La Coubre]] victims. RWB said it was "relieved" it was not given a harsher sentence. <ref name="RSFChe"/><ref name=BBC>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/misc/newsid_3500000/3500368.stm |title=RSF y la foto del "Che"| publisher=BBC |date=2004-03-11 |language=Spanish}}</ref> The face had been superimposed by RWB with that of a May 1968 [[Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité|CRS]] anti-riot police agent, and the postcard handed out at [[Orly Airport]] in Paris to tourists boarding on flights for Cuba. Korda's daughter declared to ''[[Granma (newspaper)|Granma]]'' that "Reporters Without Borders should call themselves Reporters Without Principles."<ref>Pedro de La Hoz, [http://www.granma.cu/espanol/2003/julio/vier11/menard.html Ménard trasquilado – Tribunal francés prohíbe utilización espuria de imagen del Che en campaña mediática anticubana], ''[[Granma (newspaper)|Granma]]'', 11 July 2003 {{es icon}}</ref> On April 24, 2003, RWB organized a demonstration outside the Cuban embassy in Paris. <ref name=F5>[http://www.france5.fr/cdanslair/D00063/314/ Quand Castro disparaîtra], ''[[France 5]]'' {{fr icon}}</ref> . 

RWB in turn has been described as an "ultra-reactionary" organization by the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party, ''[[Granma (newspaper)|Granma]]''. <ref name="RSFChe"/> Tensions between Cuban authorities and RWB are high, particularly after the imprisonment in 2003 of 75 dissidents (27 journalists) by the Cuban Government, including [[Raúl Rivero]] and [[Óscar Elías Biscet]]. An article by John Cherian in the [[India]]n magazine ''[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]'' alleged that RWB "is reputed to have strong links with Western intelligence agencies" and "Cuba has accused Robert Meynard [sic] the head of the group, of having [[CIA]] links". <ref name=Frontline>Cherian, John (29 March&nbsp;– 11 April 2008).

RWB has denied that its campaigning on Cuba are related to payments it has received from anti-Castro organisations. <ref>[http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=14352 "Why we take so much interest in Cuba"]. Reporters Without Borders. 8 July 2005. </ref> In 2004, it received $50,000 from the Miami based exile group, the Center for a Free Cuba, which was personally signed by the US State Department's Special Envoy to the Western Hemisphere, Otto Reich. <ref name=RWBU /> RWB has also received extensive funding from other institutions long critical of Fidel Castro's government, including the [[International Republican Institute]]. <ref name=Diplo_Venezuela>Maurice Lemoine, [http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2002/08/LEMOINE/16804 Coups d'Etat sans frontières], ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', August 2002 {{fr icon}}</ref> .

In 2004, Reporters Without Borders released an annual report on Haiti, saying that a "climate of terror" existed in which attacks and threats persisted against those journalists who were critical of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,RSF,,HTI,4562d94e2,46e690edc,0.html|title=Reporters Without Borders Annual Report 2004 – Haiti|year=2004|publisher=Reporters Without Borders|accessdate=25 January 2010}}</ref> . 

An August 2006 article in ''CounterPunch'' accused RWB of ignoring similar attacks on journalists under the [[Gérard Latortue|Latortue]] government in 2005 and 2006, including that of [[Pacifica Radio]] reporter [[Kevin Pina]]. <ref name="cp2">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.counterpunch.com/barahona08012006.html|title=Reporters Without Borders and Washington's Coups|work=[[CounterPunch]]|date=1 August 2006|first=Dianalast=Barahona|first2=Jeb|last2=Sprague|archivedate=4 June 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110604214211/http://www.counterpunch.com/barahona08012006.html}}</ref> Pina himself said:
{{quote|It was clear early on that RWB and Robert Menard were not acting as objective guardians of freedom of the press in Haiti but rather as central actors in what can only be described as a disinformation campaign against Aristide's government ... They provide false information and skewed reports to build internal opposition to governments seen as uncontrollable and unpalatable to Washington while softening the ground for their eventual removal by providing justification under the pretext of attacks on the freedom of the press. <ref name="cp2" />}} . 

===Venezuela===. 
''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'' has criticized RWB's attitude towards [[Hugo Chávez]]'s government in [[Venezuela]], in particular during the [[2002 Venezuela coup attempt|2002 coup attempt]]. <ref name=Diplo_Venezuela>Lemoine, Maurice (August 2002). [http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2002/08/LEMOINE/16804 "Coups d'Etat sans frontières"]. ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'' {{fr icon}}. </ref> In a [[right of reply]], Robert Ménard declared that RWB had also condemned the Venezuela media's support of the coup attempt. <ref name=Junqua/> RWB has also been criticized for supporting [[Globovision]]'s version of events about its false reporting in relation to a 2009 earthquake, claiming Globovision was "being hounded by the government and the administration". <ref>[http://axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/Article_56162.shtml "Reporters Without Borders' Lies about Venezuela"]. ''Axis of Logic''. 27 June 2009. </ref> . 

===France===. 
According to Observatoire de l'Action Humanitaire (Centre for Humanitarian Action), ever since Robert Ménard was replaced by Jean-François Julliard in September 2008, RWB has been concerned with violations of press freedom not only in third-world dictatorships but also in developed countries like France. Through widening its geographical scope, RWB aims at countering accusations of overly focusing on left-wing regimes unfriendly to the US. <ref>[http://www.observatoire-humanitaire.org/fusion.php?l=FR&id=33 Reporters Without Borders] in the List of NGOs Surveyed in France by the Centre for Humanitarian Action, 29 September 2010: "Depuis que Jean-François Julliard a remplacé Robert Ménard en septembre 2008, l’association [...] ne s’occupe plus seulement des violations des droits de la presse dans les dictatures du tiers-monde et couvre aussi des pays développés comme la France. Un pareil élargissement géographique permet notamment à l’association de réagir aux critiques qui l’accusaient de trop se focaliser sur les régimes de gauche hostiles aux Etats-Unis."</ref> . 

===International Online Free Expression Day===. 
[[UNESCO]], who initially had granted patronage to the first International Online Free Expression Day to be held on March 12, 2008, withdrew its patronage on the day of the event giving as reasons that RWB "published material concerning a number of UNESCO's Member States, which UNESCO had not been informed of and could not endorse" and that "UNESCO's logo was placed in such a way as to indicate the Organization's support of the information presented." RWB responded in a press release that “UNESCO has withdrawn its support to the promotion of this campaign because several of the Nations which are part of the list of Internet Enemies published by the nongovernmental organization have directly put pressure to achieve it.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathaba.net/news/?x=585297 |title=UNESCO withdraw patronage to Reporters Without Border |publisher=Mathaba.net |date=2008-03-13 |accessdate=2012-03-03}}</ref> .
