A '''gag order''' (also known as a '''gagging order''' or '''suppression order''') is an order, sometimes a legal order by a [[court]] or government, other times a private order by an employer or other institution, restricting information or comment from being made public, or in some cases, passed onto a 3rd party.  . 

Gag orders are often used against participants involved in a lawsuit or criminal trial. They are also a tool to prevent media from publishing unwanted information on a particular topic. A Criminal Court, for instance, will issue a gag order on the media if the judge believes that potential jurors in a future trial will be influenced by the media reporting or speculation on the early stages of a case.  Another example might be to ensure police are not impeded in their investigations by media publicity about a case.  . 

In a similar manner, a 'gag law' is intended to limit [[freedom of the press]], by instituting [[censorship]] or restricting access to information.  . 

==Examples of gag orders==. 
===India===. 
After the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]] in which live streaming of the event was broadcast, the [[Government of India|Indian government]] proposed a draft law that would gag media outlets broadcasting live pictures during a terrorist event or war, to ensure the safety of any hostages and to protect security operations from hindrance. This has been opposed by [[Media of India|Indian media]] who argue that they have adopted 'self-regulation' during such events and refrain from doing so anyway. It is uncertain if the draft law will be passed or not. <ref>{{cite news |title=Law readied to gag TV in crises |first=Manoj |last=Mitta |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-01-07/india/28028211_1_security-personnel-draft-rules-broadcasters |newspaper=[[The Times of India]] |date=7 January 2009 |accessdate=8 September 2011}}</ref> . 

===Israel===. 
In late 2009 Israel issued a gag order against the Israeli media reporting on facts surrounding the [[Anat Kamm-Uri Blau affair]].  The gag order was ultimately subject to widespread criticism and publicity as the details of the case were reported overseas.  The scandal centered around leaked documents from the [[Israeli Defense Force]] which suggested the military had engaged in [[extrajudicial killings]]. <ref>{{cite news |title=Debate in Israel on Gag Order in Security Leak Case |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/world/middleeast/07israel.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=6 April 2010 |accessdate=8 September 2011}}</ref> . 

===Malaysia===. 
There was speculation that a gag order may be imposed by the [[Malaysian Chinese Association|MCA]] on their press statements before they are released to the public to "ensure maximum effectiveness". Such releases would have to be approved by the president. <ref>[http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsgeneral.php?id=382218 Order To Endorse Press Statements To Maximise Effectiveness, Says Tee Keat], [[Bernama]], 8 January 2009. </ref> These claims in the media were later denied. <ref>[http://www.thesundaily.com/article.cfm?id=29048 Tee Keat: No gag order on MCA bureau chiefs], The Sun Daily, 8 January 2009. </ref> . 

===Puerto Rico=== . 

A Bill was introduced before the [[Puerto Rican Senate]] which would restrain the rights of the independence and nationalist movements in the island. The Senate at the time was controlled by the PPD and presided by Luis Muñoz Marín. <ref>[http://academiajurisprudenciapr.org/en/revistas/volumen-vii/ "La obra jurídica del Profesor David M. Helfeld (1948-2008)'; by: Dr. Carmelo Delgado Cintrón]</ref> The Bill, also known as the [[Puerto Rico's Gag Law|"Ley de la Mordaza"]] (Gag Law) was approved by the Puerto Rican legislature on May 21, 1948. It made it illegal to display a Puerto Rican flag, to sing a patriotic tune, to talk of independence, and to fight for the liberation of the island. The Bill which resembled the anti-communist [[Smith Act|Smith Law]] passed in the United States, was signed and made into law on June 10, 1948, by the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, [[Jesús T. Piñero]] and became known as "Ley 53" (Law 53). <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topuertorico.org/history5.shtml |title=Puerto Rican History |publisher=Topuertorico.org |date=January 13, 1941 |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}</ref> In accordance to the new law, it would be a crime to print, publish, sale, to exhibit or organize or to help anyone organize any society, group or assembly of people whose intentions are to paralyze or destroy the insular government. Anyone accused and found guilty of disobeying the law could be sentenced to ten years of prison, be fined $10,000 dollars (US) or both. According to [[Leopoldo Figueroa]], a member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, the law was repressive and was in violation of the First Amendment of the [[US Constitution]] which guarantees [[Freedom of Speech]]. He pointed out that the law as such was a violation of the civil rights of the people of Puerto Rico. <ref name="LG">[http://issuu.com/jaimepartsch/docs/jes_s_t._pi_ero_y_la_guerra_fria?mode=a_p La Gobernación de Jesús T. Piñero y la Guerra Fría]</ref> . 

===United States===. 
A [[National Security Letter]], an administrative subpoena used by the [[FBI]], has an attached gag order which restricts the recipient from ever saying anything about being served with one. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aclu.org/national-security/aclu-roadmap-justice-department-inspector-general-s-review-fbi-s-use-national-secu |title=ACLU Roadmap of Justice Department Inspector General’s Review of the FBI’s Use of National Security Letters |date=19 March 2007 |publisher=[[American Civil Liberties Union]] |accessdate=10 September 2011}}</ref> The government has issued hundreds of thousands of such NSLs accompanied with gag orders. The gag orders have been upheld in court. <ref>{{cite news |title=Judge Refuses to Lift 5-Year-Old Patriot Act Gag Order |first=David |last=Kravets |url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/10/patriot-act-gag/ |newspaper=[[Wired News]] |date=20 October 2009 |accessdate=10 September 2011}}</ref> . 

In the United States, a court can order parties to a case not to comment on it but has no authority to stop unrelated reporters from reporting on a case.  Most statutes which restrict what may be reported have generally been found [[unconstitutional]] and void. However, the gag provisions of the [[WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act]] have been upheld.  . 

The trials of [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]] suspects have also been subjected to a gag order, which has hindered public scrutiny. <ref>{{cite news |title=Judge's Order Could Keep Public From Hearing Details of 9/11 Trials |first=Peter |last=Finn |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/06/AR2009010603374.html? |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=7 January 2009 |accessdate=10 September 2011}}</ref> Likewise, as part of a plea bargain [[John Walker Lindh]] consented to a gag order to not talk to the press or others.  . 

===United Kingdom===.

A gag order has been used to protect 'national security'. In the [[Allan Chappelow]] murder case, the trial was held mostly ''[[in camera]]'' and media were prevented from speculating on the case. The order was imposed after a "compelling case" made by prosecutors, despite overwhelming media opposition brought by a legal challenge to the ruling. <ref>{{cite news |title=Secrecy ruling over murder trial |first=Dominic |last=Casciani |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7190269.stm |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |date=15 January 2008 |accessdate=10 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Secrets and lies |first=Richard |last=Norton-Taylor |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jan/11/politics.ukcrime |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=11 January 2008 |accessdate=10 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=News in Brief |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article3182382.ece |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=14 January 2008 |accessdate=10 September 2011}}</ref> This criminal case has been thought to be the first in which a gagging order was imposed. <ref>{{cite news |title=Why is Home Office trying to stage murder trial in secret? |first=Frances |last=Gibb |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article3042941.ece |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=13 December 2007 |accessdate=10 September 2011}}</ref> . 

According to [[WikiLeaks]], "the Guardian [has] been served with 10 secret gag orders —so-called "super-injunctions"— [between January and September 2009]. In 2008, the paper was served with six. In 2007, five."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mirror.wikileaks.info/wiki/Guardian_still_under_secret_toxic_waste_gag/ |title=Guardian still under secret toxic waste gag |author= |date=14 October 2009 |publisher=[[WikiLeaks]] |accessdate=8 September 2011}}</ref> . 

In Spring 2011, gagging orders, or "[[super-injunction]]s" as they were called, were being referred to almost daily in the United Kingdom after a number of high-profile public figures, including celebrities and politicians, [[censorship|censored]] the British media from revealing information about their personal lives, such as affairs<ref>{{cite news |title=Ryan Giggs: from golden boy to tarnished idol |first=Steven |last=Swinford |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/8532042/Ryan-Giggs-from-golden-boy-to-tarnished-idol.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=23 May 2011 |accessdate=28 May 2011}}</ref> and dealings with prostitutes.  .
