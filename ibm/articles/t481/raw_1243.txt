'''Secrecy''' (also called '''clandestinity''' or '''furtiveness''') is the practice of hiding information from certain individuals or groups, perhaps while sharing it with other individuals. That which is kept hidden is known as the '''secret'''.  . 

Secrecy is often controversial, depending on the content of the secret, the group or people keeping the secret, and the motivation for secrecy. Secrecy by government entities is often decried as excessive or in promotion of poor operation; excessive revelation of information on individuals can conflict with virtues of [[privacy]] and [[confidentiality]].  .

== Secrecy in sociology and zoology ==. 
{{Main|Sociological aspects of secrecy}}
[[Animal]]s conceal the location of their [[den]] or [[nest]] from [[predation|predators]]. Squirrels bury nuts, hiding them, and they try to remember their locations later.  . 

[[Human]]s attempt to consciously conceal aspects of themselves from others due to [[shame]], or from [[fear]] of violence, rejection, harassment, loss of [[acceptance]], or loss of [[employment]]. Humans may also attempt to conceal aspects of their own [[Self (psychology)|self]] which they are not capable of incorporating psychologically into their [[Consciousness|conscious]] being.  [[Family|Families]] sometimes maintain "[[family secret]]s", obliging family members never to discuss disagreeable issues concerning the family with outsiders or sometimes even within the family. Many "family secrets" are maintained by using a mutually agreed-upon construct (an official family story) when speaking with outside members. Agreement to maintain the secret is often coerced through "shaming" and reference to family [[honor]].  The information may even be something as trivial as a [[recipe]].  . 

Keeping one's [[strategy]] secret is important in many aspects of [[game theory]].  . 

=== Secret sharing (anthropology) ===. 
In [[anthropology]] ''secret sharing'' is one way for men and women to establish traditional relations with other men and women.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} A commonly used{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} narrative that describes this kind of behavior is [[Joseph Conrad]]'s short story "[[The Secret Sharer]]".  . 

== Government secrecy ==. 
[[Government]]s often attempt to conceal information from other governments and the public. These '''state secrets''' can include [[weapon]] designs, military plans, [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] [[negotiation]] tactics, and secrets obtained illicitly from others ("[[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]]"). Most nations have some form of [[Official Secrets Act]] (the [[Espionage Act]] in the [[U.S.]]) and classify material according to the level of protection needed (hence the term "[[classified information]]"). An individual needs a [[security clearance]] for access and other protection methods, such as keeping documents in a [[safe]], are stipulated.  . 

Few people dispute the desirability of keeping [[Critical Nuclear Weapon Design Information]] secret, but many believe government secrecy to be excessive and too often employed for political purposes.  Many countries have laws that attempt to limit government secrecy, such as the U.S. [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] and [[sunshine law]]s. Government officials sometimes [[political leak|leak]] information they are supposed to keep secret. (''For a recent (2005) example, see [[Plame affair]].'') . 

Secrecy in elections is a growing issue, particularly secrecy of vote counts on computerized vote counting machines.  While voting, citizens are acting in a unique sovereign or "owner" capacity (instead of being a subject of the laws, as is true outside of elections) in selecting their government servants.  It is argued that secrecy is impermissible as against the public in the area of elections where the government gets all of its power and taxing authority.  In any event, permissible secrecy varies significantly with the context involved.  . 

==Corporate security==. 
Organizations, ranging from multi-national for profit [[corporation]]s to nonprofit [[charities]], keep secrets for [[competitive advantage]], to meet legal requirements, or, in some cases, to conceal nefarious behavior. New products under development, unique manufacturing techniques, or simply lists of customers are types of information protected by [[trade secret]] laws. The [[patent]] system encourages inventors to publish information in exchange for a limited time [[monopoly]] on its use, though patent applications are initially secret. [[Secret society|Secret societies]] use secrecy as a way to attract members by creating a sense of importance.  . 

Other laws ''require'' organizations to keep certain information secret, such as [[medical record]]s ([[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] in the U.S.), or [[financial report]]s that are under preparation (to limit [[insider trading]]). [[Europe]] has particularly strict laws about [[database]] privacy.  . 

In many countries, [[neoliberal]] reforms of government have included expanding the outsourcing of government tasks and functions to private businesses with the aim of improving efficiency and effectiveness in government administration. However, among the criticisms of these reforms is the claim that the pervasive use of "[[Commercial-in-confidence]]" (or secrecy) clauses in contracts between government and private providers further limits public accountability of governments and prevents proper public scrutiny of the performance and probity of the private companies. Concerns have been raised that 'commercial-in-confidence' is open to abuse because it can be deliberately used to hide corporate or government maladministration and even corruption.  A string of publicly scandalous revelations about poor, wasteful or corrupt management of government-funded private contracts left unchecked for lengthy periods, often in prison management,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} has added credence to the views of skeptics about the prudency of the neoliberal reforms themselves.  . 

== Technology secrecy ==. 
{{See also|Full disclosure|Kerckhoffs' principle|security through obscurity}}
Preservation of secrets is one of the goals of [[information security]]. Techniques used include [[physical security]] and [[cryptography]]. The latter depends on the secrecy of [[cryptographic key]]s. Secrecy is central to [[organized crime]]. Many believe that security technology can be more effective if it itself is not kept secret.  . 

[[Information hiding]] is a design principle in much [[software engineering]]. It is considered easier to verify software reliability if one can be sure that different parts of the program can only access (and therefore depend on) a known limited amount of information.  . 

== Military secrecy ==. 
{{See also|Military intelligence|born secret}}
A '''military secret''' is [[secret]] information that is purposely not made available to the general public and hence to any enemy, by the [[military]] in order to gain an advantage or to not reveal a weakness, avoid [[embarrassment]] or to help in [[propaganda]] efforts.  . 

Most [[military]] secrets are military in nature, such as the strengths and weaknesses of [[weapon]]s systems, [[military tactics|tactics]], training methods, number and location of specific weapons and plans.  . 

Some involve information in broader areas, such as secure communications, [[cryptography]], intelligence operations and cooperation with third-parties.  . 

== Views on secrecy ==. 
{{wikiquote|Secrets}}
Excessive secrecy is often cited{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} as a source of much human conflict. One may have to [[lie]] in order to hold a secret, which might lead to [[psychology|psychological]] repercussions.{{Or|date=June 2010}} The alternative, declining to answer when asked something, may suggest the answer and may therefore not always be suitable for keeping a secret. Also, the other may insist that one answer the question.{{Synthesis-inline|date=June 2010}} Nearly 2500 years ago, [[Sophocles]] wrote, "Do nothing secretly; for Time sees and hears all things, and discloses all." And [[Gautama Siddhartha]], the [[Buddha]], once said "Three things cannot long stay hidden: [[the sun]], [[the moon]] and the [[truth]]".  .
