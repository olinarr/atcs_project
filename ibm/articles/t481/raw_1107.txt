'''Transparency''', as used in [[science]], [[engineering]], [[business]], the [[humanities]] and in a [[Social actions|social]] context more generally, implies openness, communication, and [[accountability]]. Transparency is operating in such a way that it is easy for others to see what actions are performed. For example, a cashier making change at a point of sale by segregating a customer's large bills, counting up from the sale amount, and placing the change on the counter in such a way as to invite the customer to verify the amount of change demonstrates transparency.  .

[[Bank Transparency]] is the notion that there is too much opacity in the valuation and evaluation of commercial banking assets, both from regulator and investor perspectives. So-called "level III" assets and/or illiquid and structured debt securities caused great challenges during the last crisis from a valuation standpoint. FAS Statement 157 (promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board) attempted to address this issue but its language and application were amended through legislation (see [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|Emergency Stabilization Act of 2008]]) as it was perceived to create additional difficulties for banks which had to "mark-to-market" this class of debt securities. This issue is discussed at length in Macrowikinomics by [[Don Tapscott]].  . 

==Wages== . 

In 2009, UK City minister [[Lord Myners]] proposed that the pay and identity of up to 20 of the highest-paid employees at British companies should be disclosed. <ref name='retreat'/> In the UK, employees outside the boardroom are currently granted anonymity about their pay deals. <ref name='retreat'/> He also called for the pay of all employees to be banded in grades. In his interim report in July, David Walker suggested that bankers' pay levels should be disclosed in bands and that the number of staff falling in each band be included. <ref name='retreat'>{{cite news | first=Jill | last=Treanor | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Government retreats over naming bank top earners - Top 20 highest paid employees now unlikely to be identified unless they have boardroom roles | date=22 November 2009 | publisher= | url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/nov/22/banks-top-20-earners | work =The Guardian | pages = | accessdate = 2009-11-22 | language = }}</ref> However, it is unlikely in the UK that disclosure requirements will be made a legal requirement, with hopes being placed on recommendations being undertaken voluntarily. <ref name='retreat'/>  . 

Regulations in Hong Kong require banks to list their top earners – without naming them – by pay band. <ref name='retreat'/> . 

In Norway, tax authorities annually release the "skatteliste" or "tax list"; official records showing the annual income and overall wealth of nearly every taxpayer. <ref name='NY'/> . 

In 2009, the Spanish government for the first time released information on how much each cabinet member is worth, but data on ordinary citizens is still private. <ref name='NY'>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Norway Divided by Citizen Wealth Tables | date=October 23, 2009 | publisher= | url =http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/24/business/global/24tax.html?_r=2&ref=global | work =The New York Times | pages = | accessdate = 2009-11-22 | language = }}</ref> . 

==Management== . 

[[Radical transparency]] is a [[management]] method where nearly all decision making is carried out publicly. All draft documents, all arguments for and against a proposal, all final decisions, and the decision making process itself are made public and remain publicly archived. Two examples of organizations utilizing this style are the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community and [[Indymedia]].  . 

==Corporate== . 

[[Corporate transparency]], a form of [[radical transparency]], is the concept of removing all barriers to —and the facilitating of— free and easy public access to corporate information and the laws, rules, social [[connivance]] and processes that facilitate and protect those individuals and corporations that freely join, develop, and improve the process. <ref>[http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2005/405/essentials/p34.htm Corporate Transparency:Code of Ethics Disclosures]</ref> . 

==Non-governmental organizations== . 

{{Main|NGO Accountability}}
Accountability and transparency are of high relevance for [[non-governmental organisation]]s (NGOs). In view of their responsibilities to stakeholders, including donors, sponsors, programme beneficiaries, staff, states and the public, they are considered to be of even greater importance to them than to commercial undertakings. <ref name="huidobro-p60">Maria Francesch-Huidobro: ''Governance, politics and the environment: a Singapore study'', Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS), ISBN 978-981-230-831-3, 2008, [http://books.google.com/books?id=QrCqBmdZY5UC&pg=PA60 p. 60]</ref> Yet these same values are often found to be lacking in NGOs. <ref name="huidobro-p60"/> . 

The ''[[INGO Accountability Charter|International NGO Accountability Charter]]'', linked to the [[Global Reporting Initiative]], documents the commitment of its members [[international NGO]]s to accountability and transparency, requiring them to submit an annual report, among others. <ref>[http://prizmablog.com/2011/03/27/is-gri-too-much-transparency-porn-for-ngos/ Is GRI Too Much Transparency for NGOs?], PRIZMA, March 27, 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/about-the-charter/ About the Charter], www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org</ref> Signed in 2006 by 11 NGOs active in the area of humanitarian rights, the INGO Accountability Charter has been referred to as the “first global accountability charter for the non-profit sector”. <ref>Andrew Stuart Thompson: ''Laying the groundwork: Considerations for a charter for a proposed global civi society forum''. In: James W. St. G. Walker, Andrew S. Thompson: ''Critical mass: the emergence of global civil society'', The Centre for International Governance Innovation and Wilfried Laurier University Press, 2008, ISBN 978-1-55458-022-4, [http://books.google.com/books?id=I3Q0rFXjPQ4C&pg=PA214 p. 214]</ref> In 1997, the [[One World Trust]] created an ''NGO Charter'', a [[code of conduct]] comprising commitment to accountability and transparency. <ref>[http://www.oneworldtrust.org/csoproject/cso/initiatives/358/charte_des_ong_ngo_charter Charte des ONG (NGO Charter)], One World Trust, 1997</ref> . 

==Media== . 

{{Main|Media Transparency}}
[[Media Transparency]] is the concept of determining how and why [[information]] is conveyed through various means. 
If the media and the public knows everything that happens in all authorities and county administrations there will be a lot of questions, protests and suggestions coming from media and the public. People who are interested in a certain issue will try to influence the decisions. Transparency creates an everyday participation in the political processes by media and the public. One tool used to increase everyday participation in political processes is [[Freedom of information legislation|Freedom of Information]] legislation and requests. Modern [[democracy]] builds on such participation of the people and media. 
There are, for anybody who is interested, many ways to influence the decisions at all levels in society. <ref>[http://www.icmpa.umd.edu/pages/studies/transparency/main.html Openness & Accountability: A Study of Transparency in Global Media Outlets]</ref> . 

==Politics== . 

{{ref improve section|date=October 2011}}
In politics, transparency is used as a means of holding [[official|public officials]] [[accountability|accountable]] and fighting [[political corruption|corruption]]. When a [[government]]'s meetings are open to the [[Mass media|press]] and the [[public]], its [[budgets]] may be reviewed by anyone, and its laws and decisions are open to discussion, it is seen as transparent, and there is less opportunity for the authorities to abuse the system for their own interests. <ref>[http://ideas.repec.org/p/pen/papers/07-008.html The Transparency of Politics and the Quality of Politicians]</ref> . 

When military authorities [[classified information|classify]] their plans as secret, transparency is absent. This can be seen as either positive or negative; positive because it can increase [[national security]], negative because it can lead to corruption and, in extreme cases, a [[military dictatorship]].  . 

While a [[liberal democracy]] can be a [[plutocracy]], where decisions are made behind locked doors and the people have fewer possibilities to influence politics between the elections, a [[participative democracy]] is more closely connected to the will of the people.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Participative democracy, built on transparency and everyday participation, has been used officially in northern [[Europe]] for decades. In the northern European [[country]] [[Sweden]], [[Constitution_of_Sweden#Public_access_to_governmental_documents|public access to government documents]] became a law as early as 1766. It has officially been adopted as an ideal to strive for by the rest of EU.  . 

To promote transparency in [[politics]], [[Hans Peter Martin]], [[Paul van Buitenen]] ([[Europa Transparant]]) and [[Ashley Mote]] decided to cooperate under the name [[Platform for Transparency]] (PfT) in 2005. A similar organization that promotes transparency is [[Transparency International]].  . 

==Online Culture== . 

21st Century Culture affords a higher level of public transparency than ever before, and actually requires it in many cases.  People no longer have a high level of control over what is public information.  Modern technology and associated culture shifts have changed how government works (see [[WikiLeaks|wikileaks]]), what information people can find out about each other, and the ability of politicians to stay in office if they are involved in [[sex scandals]].  This is particularly interesting for mental health professionals, whose clients can now find out their sexual orientation, home address, and many other pieces of personal information online (see [http://www.zurinstitute.com/google2_clinicalupdate.html digital divide] for more info).  . 

==Research== . 

[[research|Scholarly research]] in any [[scientific method|academic discipline]] may also be labeled as (partly) transparent (or [[open research]]) if some or all relevant aspects of the research are open in the sense of [[open source]], [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] and [[open data]],<ref>[http://www.wissenschaftsrat.de/engl_start.htm German Council of Science and Humanities - it aims at creating transparency]</ref> thereby facilitating [[Recognition (sociology)|social recognition]] and [[accountability]] of the scholars who did the research and [[Reproducibility|replication]] by others interested in the matters addressed by it. <ref>[http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v3/n1/full/embor241.html Transparent science]</ref> . 

Some [[mathematicians]] and scientists are critical of using closed source [[mathematical software]] such as [[Mathematica]] for [[mathematical proofs]], because these do not provide transparency, and thus are not verifiable. <ref>[http://everything2.com/title/Mathematica+and+free+software Mathematica and free software]</ref> Open-source software such as [[Sage (mathematics software)|Sage]] aims to solve this problem. <ref>http://www.physorg.com/news116173009.html Free software brings affordability, transparency to mathematics</ref> . 

==Technology== . 

In the computer software world, [[open source software]] concerns the creation of software, to which access to the underlying [[source code]] is freely available. This permits use, study, and modification without restriction.  . 

In computer security, the debate is ongoing as to the relative merits of the [[full disclosure]] of security vulnerabilities, versus a [[Security through obscurity|security-by-obscurity]] approach.  . 

==Sports== . 

[[Sports]] has become a global business over the last century, and here, too, initiatives ranging from mandatory drug testing to the fighting of sports-related corruption are gaining ground based on the transparent activities in other domains. <ref>[http://www.transparencyinsport.org/ Transparency in Sports]</ref>{{failed verification|date=October 2011}} .
