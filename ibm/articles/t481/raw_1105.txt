The '''Espionage Act of 1917''' ({{USStatute|65|24|40|217|1917|06|15}}) is a [[United States federal law]] passed on June 15, 1917, shortly after the U.S. entry into [[World War I]]. It has been amended numerous times over the years. It was originally found in Title 50 of the U.S. Code (War) but is now found under Title 18, Crime. Specifically it is [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sup_01_18_10_I_20_37.html 18 U.S.C. §792] et seq. <ref>Cornell Law: [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sup_01_18_10_I_20_37.html USC 18, Pt 1, Ch 37], accessed December 4, 2010</ref> . 

It originally prohibited any attempt to interfere with [[military operations]], to support U.S. enemies during wartime, to promote insubordination in the military, or to interfere with military recruitment. In 1919, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] unanimously ruled in ''[[Schenck v. United States]]'' that the act did not violate the [[freedom of speech]] of those convicted under its provisions. The constitutionality of the law, its relationship to [[free speech]], and the meaning of the law's language have been contested in court ever since.  . 

Among those who have been charged with offenses under the Act are former [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society]] president [[Joseph F. Rutherford]], communists [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]], [[Pentagon Papers]] [[whistleblower]] [[Daniel Ellsberg]], and alleged [[cablegate]] [[whistleblower]] [[Bradley Manning]].  Rutherford's conviction was overturned on appeal. <ref>Rogerson, Alan (1969), Millions Now Living Will Never Die, Constable, London, ISBN 0-09-455940-6, full text at [http://www.archive.org/stream/MillionsNowLivingWillNeverDieRogerson/Millions_Now_Living_Rogerson_djvu.txt]</ref>  The most controversial sections of the Act, including the original section 3, under which Rutherford was convicted, were repealed in 1921. <ref>Title 50 U.S. Code Notes: [http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/50C4.txt], accessed January 21, 2012</ref> . 

==Enactment== . 

The Espionage Act of 1917 was passed, along with the [[Trading with the Enemy Act 1917|Trading with the Enemy Act]], just after the United States entered World War I in April 1917. It was based on the [[Defense Secrets Act of 1911]], especially the notions of obtaining or delivering information relating to "national defense" to a person who was not "entitled to have it", itself based on an earlier British [[Official Secrets Act]]. The Espionage Act law imposed much stiffer penalties than the 1911 law, including the death penalty. <ref name=eric1/> . 

President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in his December 7, 1915 State of the Union address asked Congress for the legislation:<ref>Moynihan, ''Secrecy''. 89</ref>
{{quote|There are citizens of the United States ... who have poured the poison of disloyalty into the very arteries of our national life; who have sought to ring the authority and good name of our Government into contempt ... to destroy our industries ... and to debase our politics to the uses of foreign intrigue.... [W]e are without adequate federal laws.... I am urging you to do nothing less than save the honor and self-respect of the nation. Such creatures of passion, disloyalty,and anarchy must be crushed out.}} . 

Congress moved slowly. Even after the U.S broke diplomatic relations with Germany, when the Senate passed a version on February 20, 1916, the House did not vote before for the session Congress ended. After the declaration of war in April 1917, both houses debated versions of the Wilson administration's drafts that included press censorship. <ref>Moynihan, ''Secrecy'', 90–92</ref> That provision aroused opposition, with critics charging it established a system of "prior restraint" and delegated unlimited power to the president. <ref>Harold Edgar and Benno C. Schmidt, Jr., "The Espionage Statutes and the Publication of Defense Information", ''Columbia Law Review''. v. 73. no. 5, May 1973, 950–951</ref> After weeks of intermittent debate, the Senate removed the censorship provision by a one-vote margin, voting 39 to 38. <ref>Moynihan, ''Secrecy'', 92–95</ref> Wilson still insisted it was needed: "Authority to exercise censorship over the press ... is absolutely necessary to the public safety." but signed the Act without the censorship provisions on June 15, 1917. <ref>Moynihan, ''Secrecy'', 96</ref> . 

Attorney General [[Thomas Watt Gregory]] supported passage of the act, but viewed it as a compromise. The President's Congressional rivals were proposing to remove responsibility for monitoring pro-German activity, whether espionage or some form of disloyalty, from the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] to the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] and creating a form of courts-martial of doubtful constitutionality. The resulting Act was far more aggressive and restrictive than they wanted, but it silenced citizens opposed to the war. <ref name=Kennedy80>{{cite book |author=[[David M. Kennedy (historian)|]] |coauthors= |title=Over Here: The First World War and American Society |year=2004 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page= | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=s6dSIuBcx1IC&dq |isbn=0-19-517399-6 }}</ref> Officials in the Justice Department who had little enthusiasm for the law nevertheless hoped that even without generating many prosecutions it would help quiet public calls for more government action against those thought to be insufficiently patriotic. <ref>Geoffrey R. Stone, ''Perilous Times: Free Speech in Wartime from the Sedition Act of 1798 to the War on Terrorism'' (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 2004), 231–232</ref> Wilson was denied language in the Act authorizing power to the executive branch for press censorship, but Congress did include a provision to block distribution of print materials through the Post Office. <ref name=eric1/> . 

It made it a crime: . 

* To convey information with intent to interfere with the operation or success of the [[United States armed forces|armed forces of the United States]] or to promote the success of its enemies. This was punishable by death or by imprisonment for not more than 30 years or both.  . 

* To convey false reports or false statements with intent to interfere with the operation or success of the military or naval forces of the United States or to promote the success of its enemies when the United States is at war, to cause or attempt to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, refusal of duty, in the military or naval forces of the United States, or to willfully obstruct the recruiting or enlistment service of the United States. This was punishable by a maximum fine of $10,000 or by imprisonment for not more than 20 years or both.  . 

The Act also gave the [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] authority to impound or to refuse to mail publications that he determined to be in violation of its prohibitions. <ref>Ann Hagedorn, ''Savage Peace: Hope and Fear in America, 1919'' (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2007), 29</ref> . 

The Act also forbids the transfer of any naval vessel equipped for combat to any nation engaged in a conflict in which the United States is neutral. Seemingly uncontroversial when the Act was passed, this later became a legal stumbling block for the administration of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], when he sought to provide military aid to Great Britain before the United States entered World War II. <ref>Jean Edward Smith, ''FDR'' (New York: Random House, 2007), 467, 755n54</ref> . 

===Amendments===. 
The law was extended on May 16, 1918, by the [[Sedition Act of 1918]]&ndash;actually a set of amendments to the Espionage Act&ndash;which prohibited many forms of speech, including "any disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language about the form of government of the United States ... or the flag of the United States, or the uniform of the Army or Navy". <ref name=Kennedy80 /> . 

Because the Sedition Act was an informal name, court cases were brought under the name of the Espionage Act, whether the charges were based on the provisions of the Espionage Act or the provisions of the amendments known informally as the Sedition Act.  . 

On March 3, 1921, the Sedition Act amendments were repealed, but many provisions of the Espionage Act remain, codified under [[United States Code|U.S.C.]] Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 37. <ref>[http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/18C37.txt 18 U.S.C §&nbsp;37 - Espionage and Censorship]</ref><ref>Cornell Law School: [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sup_01_18_10_I_20_37.html Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 37], accessed December 4, 2010</ref> . 

In 1933, after signals intelligence expert [[Herbert Yardley]] published a popular book about breaking Japanese codes, the Act was amended to prohibit the disclosure of foreign code or anything sent in code. <ref>Moynihan, ''Secrecy'', 97; Herbert Yardley, ''The American Black Chamber'' (Bobbs-Merrill, 1931)</ref> The Act was amended in 1940 to increase the penalties it imposed, and again in 1970. <ref>C. William Michaels, ''No Greater Threat: America after September 11 and the Rise of a National Security State'' (Algora Publishing, 2002), 21, [http://books.google.com/books?id=SZyWQ805QR0C&pg=PA21& available online], accessed December 1, 2010</ref> . 

In the late 1940s the U.S. Code was re-organized and much of Title 50 (War) was moved to Title 18 (Crime). The [[McCarran Internal Security Act]] added {{uscsub|18|793|e}} in 1950 and {{uscsub|18|798}} was added the same year. <ref name=edgsch/> . 

In 1961, Congressman [[Richard Harding Poff|Richard Poff]] succeeded after several attempts in removing language that restricted the Act's application to territory "within the jurisdiction of the United States, on the high seas, and within the United States" {{uscsub|18|791}}. He said the need for the Act apply everywhere was prompted by the [[Irvin C. Scarbeck|Scarbeck]] case, a State Department official charged with yielding to blackmail threats in Poland. <ref>[http://www.archive.org/stream/congressionalrec107dunit#page/n1190/mode/1up Congressional Record, 87th, 1961, p 10668]</ref> . 

===Proposed amendments===. 
In 1989, Congressman [[James Trafficant]] tried to amend {{uscsub|18|794}} to broaden the application of the death penalty. <ref>James Trafficant, [http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/1989_cr/h890222-spy.htm Civilian Espionage Penalties Amendments Act] 1989 2 22, fas.org</ref> Senator [[Arlen Spector]] proposed a comparable expansion of the use of the death penalty the same year. <ref>[http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/1989_cr/s890731-amend-spy.htm National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 AND 1991], Arlen Spector, Jul 31, 1989, fas.org</ref> In 1994, [[Robert K. Dornan]] proposed the death penalty for the disclosure of a U.S. agent's identity. <ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d103:23:./temp/~bdKHmW:: H.R.4060] 103rd congress, thomas.loc.gov</ref> .

===World War I===. 
[[File:Blessed are the Peacemakers.gif|alt=|thumb|right|''Blessed are the Peacemakers'' by [[George Bellows]], ''[[The Masses]]'' 1917]]
{{wikisource|Debs' Speech of Sedition}}
Much of the Act's enforcement was left to the discretion of local [[United States Attorney]]s, so enforcement varied widely. For example, Socialist [[Kate Richards O'Hare]] gave the same speech in several states, but was convicted and sentenced to a prison term of five years for delivering her speech in North Dakota. Most enforcement activity occurred in the Western states where the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]] was active. <ref>Kennedy, ''Over Here'', 83</ref> Finally Gregory, a few weeks before the end of the war, instructed the U.S. Attorneys not to act without his approval.  . 

A year after the Act's passage, [[Eugene V. Debs]], [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] presidential candidate in 1904, 1908, and 1912 was arrested and sentenced to 10 years in prison for making a speech that "obstructed recruiting". He ran for president again in 1920 from prison. President [[Warren G. Harding]] commuted his sentence in December 1921 when he had served nearly five years. <ref>{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Harding Frees Debs and 23 Others Held for War Violations |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B0DE2D71539E133A25757C2A9649D946095D6CF |quote=Announcement was made at the White House late this afternoon that President Harding had commuted the sentences of twenty-four so-called political prisoners, including Eugene V.

In ''United States v. Motion Picture Film'' (1917), a federal court upheld the government's seizure of a film called ''[[The Spirit of '76 (1917 film)|The Spirit of '76]]'' on the grounds that its depiction of cruelty on the part of British soldiers during the American Revolution would undermine support for America's wartime ally. The producer, [[Robert Goldstein]], a Jew of German origins, was prosecuted under Title XI of the Act, and received a ten-year sentence plus a fine of $5000. The sentence was commuted on appeal to three years. <ref>{{Cite book | last = Manchel | first = Frank | authorlink = Frank Manchel| title = Film Study: An Analytical Bibliography | publisher = Fairleigh Dickinson University Press | year = 1990| location = | pages = 223 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=BebEAji_wH4C&lpg=PA223&dq=frank%20manchel%20espionage%20act&pg=PA223#v=onepage&q&f=false| isbn = 0-8386-3414-1}}</ref> . 

Postmaster General [[Albert S. Burleson]] and those in his department played critical roles in the enforcement of the Act. He held his position because he was a Democratic party loyalist and close to both the President and the Attorney General. At a time when the Department of Justice numbered its investigators in the dozens, the Post Office had a nationwide network in place. The day after the Act became law, Burleson sent a secret memo to all postmasters ordering them to keep "close watch on ... matter which is calculated to interfere with the success of ... the government in conducting the war". <ref>Christopher Cappozolla, ''Uncle Sam Wants You: World War I and the Making of the Modern American Citizen'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2008), 151–152</ref> Postmasters in [[Savannah, Georgia]], and [[Tampa, Florida]], refused to mail the ''Jeffersonian'', the mouthpiece of [[Thomas E. Watson|Tom Watson]], a southern populist, an opponent of the draft, the war, and minority groups. When Watson sought an injunction against the postmaster, the federal judge who heard the case called his publication "poison" and denied his request. Government censors objected to the headline "Civil Liberty Dead". <ref>{{cite book | last = Paxson | first = Frederic | title = America At War 1917 1918 | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company | year = 1939 | pages = | url = http://www.archive.org/stream/americaatwar1917002444mbp/americaatwar1917002444mbp_djvu.txt | isbn = }}</ref>
In New York City, the postmaster refused to mail ''[[The Masses]]'', a socialist monthly, citing the publication's "general tenor". ''The Masses'' was more successful in the courts, where Judge [[Learned Hand]] found the Act was applied so vaguely as to threaten "the tradition of English-speaking freedom". The editors were then prosecuted for obstructing the draft and the publication folded when denied access to the mails again. <ref>Capozzola, ''Uncle Sam Wants You'', 153–155</ref> Eventually, Burleson's energetic enforcement overreached when he targeted supporters of the administration. The President warned him to exercise "the utmost caution" in his censorship efforts, and the dispute proved the end of their political friendship. <ref>Capozzola, ''Uncle Sam Wants You'', 159</ref> . 

In May 1918 sedition charges were laid under the Espionage Act against [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society]] president [[Joseph Franklin Rutherford|"Judge" Joseph Rutherford]] and seven other Watch Tower directors and officers over statements made in the society's book, ''The Finished Mystery'', published a year earlier. The book had claimed that patriotism was a delusion and murder and the officers were charged with attempting to cause insubordination, disloyalty, refusal of duty in the armed forces and obstructing the recruitment and enlistment service of the U.S. while it was at war. <ref>{{Cite book|last = Rogerson |first = Alan |title = Millions Now Living Will Never Die |publisher = Constable, London |year = 1969 |pages=42} |isbn = 0-09-455940-6}}</ref> The book had been banned in Canada since February 1918 for what a [[Winnipeg]] newspaper described as "seditious and antiwar statements"<ref>{{Cite book|last = Macmillan |first = A.H. |title = Faith on the March | publisher = Prentice-Hall |year = 1957 |pages = 85| url = http://www.e-cepher.com/books/fotm/}}</ref> and described by Attorney General Gregory as dangerous propaganda. <ref>{{Cite book|last = Macmillan |first = A.H. |title = Faith on the March | publisher = Prentice-Hall |year = 1957 |pages = 89| url = http://www.e-cepher.com/books/fotm/}}</ref> On June 21 seven of the directors, including Rutherford, were sentenced to the maximum 20 years' imprisonment for each of four charges, to be served concurrently. They served nine months in the [[United States Penitentiary, Atlanta|Atlanta Penitentiary]] before being released on bail at the order of Supreme Court judge Louis Brandeis.

===Red Scare, Palmer Raids, mass arrests, deportations===. 
[[File:Palmer Bombing.jpg|left|140px|thumb|Bombing of the Attorney General's house]]
During the [[First Red Scare|Red Scare]] of 1918–19, in response to the [[1919 United States anarchist bombings|1919 anarchist bombings]] aimed at prominent government officials and businessman, U.S. [[Attorney General]] [[A. Mitchell Palmer]], supported by [[J. Edgar Hoover]], then head of the Justice Department's Enemy Aliens Registration Section, used the [[Sedition Act]], a 1918 amendment to the Espionage Act, to deport several hundred foreign citizens, including [[Emma Goldman]], many to the Soviet Union on a ship the press called the "[[Soviet Ark]]". <ref name=eric1/><ref name=gmu1/><ref name=fenan/> . 

====''Schenck v. United States'' and the Red Scare====. 
[[File:Freedom of speech in war times.djvu|right|thumb|150px|page=6|A version of Chafee's "Free Speech in War Times", the work that helped changed Justice Holmes' mind]]
Many of the jailed challenged their convictions based on their right to [[free speech]]. The Supreme Court disagreed. The Espionage Act limits on free speech were ruled constitutional in the [[United States Supreme Court]] case ''[[Schenck v. United States]]'', [[court citation|249]] [[United States Code|U.S. 47]] in 1919. Schenck, an anti-war Socialist, had been convicted of violating the Act when he sent anti-draft pamphlets to men eligible for the draft. Although Supreme Court Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] joined the Court majority in upholding Schenck's conviction in 1919, he also introduced the theory that punishment in such cases is limited to political expression that constitutes a "[[clear and present danger]]" to the government action at issue. Holmes' opinion is also the origin of the notion that speech equivalent to "[[Shouting fire in a crowded theater]]" is not protected by the First Amendment.  . 

Justice Holmes began to doubt his decision due to criticism received from free speech advocates. He also met the Harvard Law professor [[Zechariah Chafee]] and discussed his criticism of ''Schenck''. <ref name=fenan/><ref>Chafee's treatise ''Free Speech in the United States'' included a lengthy attack on the ''Schenck'' decision. Zechariah Chafee, ''Free Speech in the United States'' (New York: Harcourt, Brace 1920)</ref> . 

Later in 1919, in [[Abrams v. United States]], the Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a man who distributed circulars in opposition to American intervention in Russia following the Russian Revolution. The concept of [[bad tendency]] was used to justify the restriction of speech. The defendant was deported. Justices Holmes and Brandeis, however, dissented, arguing that "a silly leaflet by an unknown man" could not be construed as a consequential threat. <ref name=fenan/><ref>William E. Leuchtenburg, ''The Perils of Prosperity, 1914–32'' (Chicago: [[University of Chicago Press]], 1958), 43</ref> . 

In March 1919 President Wilson, at the suggestion of Attorney General [[Thomas Watt Gregory]] pardoned or commuted the sentences of some 200 prisoners convicted under the Espionage Act or the Sedition Act. <ref>Stone, ''Perilous Times'', 191n</ref> By the end of 1920 the Red Scare had faded, Palmer left government, and the Espionage Act fell into relative disuse. The NCLB took as its new name the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]. <ref name=fenan/> . 

===World War II=== . 

Prosecutions under the Act were far less numerous during World War II than they had been during World War I. Associate Justice [[Frank Murphy]] noted in 1944 in ''Hartzel v. United States'' that "For the first time during the course of the present war, we are confronted with a prosecution under the Espionage Act of 1917." Hartzel, a World War I veteran, had distributed anti-war pamphlets to associations and business groups. The court's majority found that his materials, though comprising "vicious and unreasoning attacks on one of our military allies, flagrant appeals to false and sinister racial theories, and gross libels of the President", did not urge mutiny or any of the other specific actions detailed in the Act, and that he had targeted molders of public opinion, not members of the armed forces or potential military recruits. The court overturned his conviction in a 5–4 decision. The four dissenting justices declined to "intrude on the historic function of the jury" and would have upheld the conviction. <ref>U.S. Supreme Court Center: [http://supreme.justia.com/us/322/680/case.html "Hartzel v. United States''], accessed March 14, 2011</ref>
In ''[[Gorin v. United States]]'' (early 1941), the Supreme Court ruled on many constitutional questions surrounding the act. <ref>U.S. Supreme Court Center: [http://supreme.justia.com/us/312/19/case.html "Gorin v. United States''], accessed March 14, 2011</ref> . 

The Act was used in 1942 to deny a mailing permit to [[Charles Coughlin|Charles Coughlin's]] weekly ''[[Social Justice (periodical)|Social Justice]]'', effectively ending its distribution to subscribers. It was part of Attorney General [[Francis Biddle]]'s attempt to close down what he called "vermin publications". <ref>{{cite news |title= Mails Barred to "Social Justice" |url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&dat=19420415&id=SzsNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DGoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2530,6670133|newspaper= [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |location= Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania |date= 15 April 1942 |pages= 1–2 |accessdate= 1 January 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last= Stone |first= Goeffrey R. |year= 2004 |title= Free Speech in World War II: When are you going to indict the seditionists? |journal= International Journal of Constitutional Law }}</ref><ref name="timecom1942">

The newspaper was brought before a Grand Jury, but proceedings were halted because of government reluctance to present a jury with highly secret information necessary to prosecute the publishers as well as concern that a trial would attract more attention to the case. <ref name=comm1/> . 

In 1945 six associates of ''[[Amerasia]]'' magazine, a journal of Far Eastern affairs, came under suspicion after  publishing articles that bore similarity to [[Office of Strategic Services]] reports. The government proposed using the Espionage Act against them but later softened its approach, changing the charges to Embezzlement of Government Property (Now {{uscsub|18|641}}). A Grand Jury cleared three of the associates, two associates paid small fines, and charges against the sixth man were dropped. Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] believed the failure to aggressively prosecute the defendants was a communist conspiracy and according to Kleht and Radosh, the case helped build his notoriety. <ref name=amerasia/> . 

===Mid-20th century Soviet spies===. 
Navy employee Hafis Salich sold Soviet agent Mihail Gorin information regarding Japanese activities in the late 1930s. [[Gorin v. United States]] was cited in many later espionage cases for its discussion of the charge of "vagueness" argument made against the terminology used in certain portions of the law, such as what constitutes "national defense" information.  . 

Later in the 1940s several incidents prompted the government to increase its investigations into Soviet espionage. These included the [[Venona]] decryptions, the [[Elizabeth Bentley]] case, the [[atomic spies]] cases, the [[First Lightning]] Soviet nuke test, and others. Many suspects were surveilled, but never prosecuted and the investigations dropped, as can been seen in the [[FBI Silvermaster File]]s. However there were also many successful prosecutions and convictions under the Act.  . 

In August 1950, [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]] were indicted under Title 50, sections 32a and 34, in connection with his giving nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union. [[Anatoli Yakovlev]] was indicted as well. In 1951 [[Morton Sobell]] and [[David Greenglass]] were indicted. After a controversial trial in 1951, the Rosenbergs were sentenced to death. The sentence was carried out in 1953. <ref name=doug_linder/><ref name=fbirosenberg/><ref name=eyespy_rosenb/> In the late 1950s, several members of the [[Soble spy ring]], including [[Robert Soblen]], and [[Jack Soble|Jack]] and [[Myra Soble]], were prosecuted for espionage. In the mid-1960s, the act was used against James Mintkenbaugh and [[Robert Lee Johnson]], who sold information to the Soviets while working for the U.S. Army in Berlin. <ref name=time.com1962/><ref name=time.com1965/> . 

=== 1948 code revision and the 1950 McCarran Internal Security Act === . 

In 1948 some portions of the [[United States Code]] were reorganized. Much of Title 50 (War and National Defense) was moved to [[Title 18 of the United States Code|Title 18]] (Crimes and Criminal Procedure). Thus Title 50 Chapter 4, Espionage, (Sections 31–39), became Title 18, 792 and following. As a result, certain older cases, such as the [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg|Rosenberg]] case, are now listed under Title 50, while newer cases are often listed under Title 18. <ref name=doug_linder/><ref name=uscode.house.gov/> . 

In 1950, during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy Period]], Congress passed the [[McCarran Internal Security Act]] over President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s veto. It modified a large body of law, including espionage law. One addition was {{uscsub2|18|793|e}}, which had almost exactly the same language as {{uscsub2|18|793|d}}. According to Edgar and Schmidt, the added section potentially removes the "intent" to harm or aid requirement and may make "mere retention" of information a crime no matter what the intent, covering even former government officials writing their memoirs. They also describe McCarran saying that this portion was intended directly to respond to the case of [[Alger Hiss]] and the [[pumpkin papers]]. <ref name=edgsch/><ref name=ford_appeal1/><ref name=nyt_v_us1/> . 

===Judicial review, 1960s and 1970s===. 
==== Brandenburg ====. 
Court decisions of this era changed the standard for enforcing some provisions of the Espionage Act. Thought not a case involving charges under the Act, ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'' (1969) changed the "clear and present danger" test derived from Schenck to the "[[imminent lawless action]]" test, a considerably stricter test of the inflammatory nature of speech. <ref>{{Caselaw source|case=''Brandenburg v.

In June 1971, [[Daniel Ellsberg]] and [[Anthony Russo (whistleblower)|Anthony Russo]] were charged with a [[felony]] under the Espionage Act of 1917, because they lacked legal authority to publish classified documents that came to be known as the [[Pentagon Papers]]. <ref>{{cite web|title=The Pentagon Papers Case|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB48/nixon.html|accessdate=2005-12-05}}</ref> The Supreme Court in ''[[New York Times Co. v. United States]]'' found that the government had not made a successful case for prior restraint of Free Speech, but a majority of the justices ruled that the government could still prosecute the ''Times'' and the ''Post'' for violating the Espionage Act in publishing the documents. Ellsberg and Russo were not acquitted of violating the Espionage Act, but were freed due to a mistrial based on irregularities in the government's case. <ref>Correll, John T. "[http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2007/February%202007/0207pentagon.aspx The Pentagon Papers]" ''Air Force Magazine'', February 2007. </ref> . 

The divided Supreme Court had denied the government's request to restrain the press. In their opinions the justices expressed varying degrees of support for the First Amendment claims of the press against the government's "heavy burden of proof" in establishing that the publisher "has reason to believe" the material published "could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation".{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} . 

The case prompted Harold Edgar and Benno C. Schmidt, Jr. to write an article on espionage law in the 1973 ''Columbia Law Review''. Their article was entitled "The Espionage Statutes and Publication of Defense Information". Essentially they found the law to be poorly written and vague, with parts of it probably unconstitutional. Their article became widely cited in books and in future court arguments on Espionage cases. <ref>The Edgar & Schmidt 1973 CLR article has been cited, for example, in the [[Thomas Andrews Drake]] case of 2010. The article is available online at http://www.fas.org/sgp/library/</ref> . 

''[[United States v. Dedeyan]]'' in 1978 was the first prosecution under {{uscsub2|18|793|f|2}} (Dedeyan 'failed to report' that information had been disclosed). The courts relied on [[Gorin v. United States]] (1941) for precedent. The ruling touched on several constitutional questions including vagueness of the law and whether the information was "related to national defense". The defendant received a 3-year sentence. <ref>[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/584/36/155427/ U.S. v Dedeyan] 1978</ref><ref name=roswei1/> . 

In 1979–80, Truong and Humphrey were convicted under 793(a), (c), and (e) as well as several other laws. The ruling discussed several constitutional questions regarding espionage law, "vagueness", the difference between classified information and "national defense information", wiretapping and the Fourth Amendment. It also commented on the notion of bad faith ([[scienter]]) being a requirement for conviction even under 793(e); an "honest mistake" was said not to be a violation. <ref name=roswei1/><ref>[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/629/908/266362/ U.S. v. Truong], 1980</ref> . 

===Reagan administration===. 
[[Alfred Zehe]] was arrested in Boston in 1983 after being caught in a government-run sting operation in which he had reviewed classified U.S. government documents in Mexico and East Germany. His attorneys contended without success that the indictment was invalid, arguing that the Espionage Act does not cover the activities of a foreign citizen outside the United States. <ref name=nytplea>''The New York Times'': [http://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/22/us/east-german-enters-guilty-plea-to-buying-secret-us-documents.html "East German Enters Guilty Plea to Buying Secret U.S. Documents", February 25, 1985], accessed December 8, 2010</ref><ref>United States v.

Zehe, January 29, 1985], accessed December 8, 2010</ref> Zehe then pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 8 years in prison. He was released in June 1985 as part of an exchange of four East Europeans held by the U.S. for 25 people held in Poland and East Germany, none of them American. <ref name=nytfree>''The New York Times'': [http://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/16/weekinreview/the-world-free-to-spy-another-day.html?

One of Zehe's defense attorneys claimed his client was prosecuted as part of "the perpetuation of the 'national-security state' by over-classifying documents that there is no reason to keep secret, other than devotion to the cult of secrecy for its own sake". <ref>''Boston Phoenix'': [http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/this_just_in/documents/01710021.htm Harvey A. Silvergate, "Freedom Watch: The Real Bob Mueller", July 12–19, 2001], accessed December 8, 2010</ref> . 

The media dubbed 1985 "[[Year of the spy]]". U.S Navy civilian [[Jonathan Pollard]] was charged with {{uscsub|18|794|c}}, for selling info to Israel. His 1986 plea bargain did not get him out of a life sentence, after a 'victim impact statement' including a statement by [[Caspar Weinberger]]. <ref>http://www.jonathanpollard.org/2010/110210.htm</ref> [[Larry Wu-Tai Chin]], at CIA, was charged with {{uscsub|18|794|c}} for selling info to China. <ref>http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/848/55/291630/</ref> [[Ronald Pelton]] was dinged for {{uscsub|18|794|a}}, {{uscsub2|18|794|c}}, & {{uscsub2|18|798|a}}, for selling out to the Soviets, and ruining [[Operation Ivy Bells]]. <ref>http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/835/1067/296623/</ref> [[Edward Lee Howard]] was an ex-Peace Corps and ex-CIA agent charged with {{uscsub|17|794|c}} for allegedly dealing with the Soviets. The FBI's website says the 1980s was the "decade of the spy", with dozens of arrests. <ref>http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/the-year-of-the-spy</ref> . 

[[Seymour Hersh]] wrote an article entitled "The Traitor" arguing against Pollard's release. <ref>[http://jya.com/traitor.htm The Traitor], S. Hersh, New Yorker, 1999, retr 2011 4 11</ref>{{Dead link|date=April 2012}} . 

==== Morison ==== . 

[[Samuel Loring Morison]] was a government security analyst who worked on the side for ''[[Jane's Information Group|Jane's]]'', a British military and defense publisher. He was arrested on October 1, 1984. <ref name=arrest>''The New York Times'': [http://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/03/world/spy-photos-sale-leads-to-arrest.html Stephen Engelberg, "Spy Photos' Sale Leads to Arrest", October 3, 1984], accessed March 11, 2011</ref> Investigators never demonstrated any intent to provide information to a hostile intelligence service. Morison told investigators that he sent classified satellite photographs to ''Jane's'' because the "public should be aware of what was going on on the other side", meaning that the Soviets' new nuclear-powered aircraft carrier would transform the USSR's military capabilities. He said that "if the American people knew what the Soviets were doing, they would increase the defense budget." British intelligence sources thought his motives were patriotic. Prosecutors emphasized personal economic gain and Morison's complaints about his government job. <ref>''TIME'': [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,923689-3,00.html Alessandra Stanley, "Spy vs. Spy Saga", October 15, 1984], accessed March 11, 2011</ref> . 

The Reagan administration, as part of a wider campaign against leaks of information, used the prosecution of Morison as a "test case" for applying the Act to cover the disclosure of information to the press. A March 1984 government report had noted that "the unauthorized publication of classified information is a routine daily occurrence in the U.S." but that the applicability of the Espionage Act to such disclosures "is not entirely clear". <ref name=conchu1985/> ''Time'' said that the administration, if it failed to convict Morison, would seek additional legislation and described the ongoing conflict: "The Government does need to protect military secrets, the public does need information to judge defense policies, and the line between the two is surpassingly difficult to draw."<ref name=conchu1985>''Time'': [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959281,00.html Anne Constable, George C. Church, "Plugging the Leak of Secrets", January 28, 1985], accessed March 11, 2011</ref> . 

On October 17, 1985, Morison was convicted in Federal Court on two counts of espionage and two counts of theft of government property. <ref name=conchu1985/> He was sentenced to two years in prison on on December 4, 1985. <ref>''The New York Times'': [http://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/08/weekinreview/the-nation-two-years-for-morison.html Michael Wright and Caroline Rand Herron, "Two Years for Morison", December 8, 1985], accessed March 11, 2011</ref> The Supreme Court declined to hear his appeal in 1988. <ref name=cia /> Morison became "the only [American] government official ever convicted for giving classified information to the press" up to that time. <ref name=lewis /> Following a 1998 appeal for a pardon on the part of Senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]], President [[Bill Clinton]] pardoned Morison on January 20, 2001, the last day of his presidency,<ref name=lewis>''The New York Times'': [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0B17FC3E5F0C708CDDAA0894D9404482& [[Anthony Lewis]], "Abroad at Home; The Pardons in Perspective", March 3, 2001], accessed March 11, 2011</ref> despite the CIA's opposition to the pardon. <ref name=cia>''The New York Times'': [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50716FF3B540C748DDDAB0894D9404482& James Risen, "Clinton Did Not Consult C.I.A. Chief on Pardon, Official Says", February 17, 2001], accessed March 11, 2011</ref> . 

The Reagan administration used its successful prosecution of Morison to warn against the publication of leaked information. In May 1986, CIA Director [[William Casey]], without citing specific violations of law, threatened to prosecute five news organizations–''The Washington Post'', ''The Washington Times'', ''The New York Times'', ''Time'' and ''Newsweek''. <ref>''TIME'': [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,961418,00.html James Kelly, et al., " Press: Shifting the Attack on Leaks", May 19, 1986], accessed March 11, 2011</ref> . 

===Soviet spies, late 20th century===. 
[[Christopher John Boyce]] of [[TRW]], and his accomplice [[Andrew Daulton Lee]], sold out to the Soviets and went to prison in the 1970s. Several members of the [[Walker spy ring]] were prosecuted for their activities in the 1980s. [[David Henry Barnett]] was the first CIA officer to be convicted under the act. NSA agent [[David Sheldon Boone]] was charged for giving a 600-page technical manual to the Soviets c. 1988-1991 ({{uscsub|18|794|a}}). FBI agent [[Robert Hanssen]] was convicted under the Act for spying for the Soviets in the 1980s and Russia in the 1990s. Another FBI agent, [[Earl Edwin Pitts]], was arrested in 1996 under {{uscsub|18|794|a}} and {{uscsub|18|794|c}} for spying for the Soviet Union and later for the Russian Federation. <ref>http://www.hanford.gov/oci/maindocs/ci_r_docs/earlpitts.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/pitts_nr.htm</ref><ref name=jyaboone/><ref name=time.com1981/> . 

CIA agent [[Aldrich Ames]] was convicted under {{uscsub|18|794|c}} in the 1990s for spying for the Soviets. Ames revealed their identities of several U.S. sources to Soviet authorities, who then executed them. <ref name=time.com2005/> .

=== 1990s critiques ===. 
In the 1990s, Senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] deplored the "culture of secrecy" made possible by the Act, noting the tendency of bureaucracies to enlarge their powers by increasing the scope of what is held "secret". <ref>{{Citation | last = Moynihan| first = Daniel| title = Secrecy: The American Experience| publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1999| page = 155| isbn = 978-0-300-08079-7}}; {{Citation| last = Vaughn| first = Stephen | title = Encyclopedia of American Journalism| publisher = Taylor & Francis, Inc.| year = 2007| month= July| page = 155| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=Wo8IY5oMpX4C&pg=PA155| isbn = 978-0-415-96950-5}}</ref> . 

In the late 1990s, Dr. [[Wen Ho Lee]] of [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (LANL) was indicted under the Act. He and other national security professionals later said he was a "scapegoat" in the government's quest to determine if information about the [[W88]] nuclear warhead had been transferred to China. Dr. Lee had made [[backup]] copies at LANL of his nuclear weapons simulations code to protect it in case of a system crash. The code was marked [[Sensitive but unclassified|PARD]], sensitive but not classified. As part of a [[plea bargain]], he pled guilty to one count under the Espionage Act. The judge apologized to him for having believed the government. Lee later won a more than a million dollars in a lawsuit against the government and several newspapers for their mistreatment of him. <ref>Wen Ho Lee, ''My Country Versus Me: The First-Hand Account by the Los Alamos Scientist who was Falsely Accused of being a Spy'' (Hyperion, 2002), pp. ??</ref> . 

=== 21st century ===. 
In 2005 Pentagon Iran expert [[United States v. Franklin, Rosen, and Weissman|Lawrence Franklin, along with AIPAC lobbyists Rosen and Weissman]], were indicted under the act. Franklin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to disclose national defense information to the lobbyists and an Israeli government official. <ref>''The New York Times'': [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/06/politics/06spy.html Eric Lichtblau, "Pentagon Analyst Admits Sharing Secret Data", October 6, 2005], accessed March 13, 2001</ref> Franklin was sentenced to more than 12 years in prison, but the sentence was later reduced to 10 months of home confinement<ref>''The Washington Post'': [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/11/AR2009061104280.html "Sentence Reduced in PentagonCase", June 12, 2009], accessed March 13, 2011</ref> and community service. In 2007 the trial became the first to successfully use the controversial [[silent witness rule]]. The charges against Rosen and Weissman were dropped in 2009.  . 

Many prosecutions in the early 21st century related not to traditional [[espionage]] but to either "withholding" information or communicating with members of the media. There were five such prosecutions in 2010.  . 

Kenneth Wayne Ford Jr. was indicted under the Espionage Act {{uscsub|18|793|e}} for allegedly having a box of documents in his house after he left NSA employment around 2004. He was sentenced to six years in prison in 2006. <ref name=jireport1/> . 

[[Jeffrey Alexander Sterling]], a former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent was indicted under the Act in January 2011 for alleged unauthorized disclosure of national defense information to [[James Risen]], a ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter, in 2003 regarding his book [[State of War]]. The indictment described his motive as revenge for the CIA's refusal to allow him to publish his memoirs and its refusal to settle his racial discrimination lawsuit against the Agency. Others have described him as telling Risen about a backfired CIA plot against Iran in the 1990s. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://abcnews.go.com/US/Blotter/cia-agent-jeffrey-sterling-arrested-accused-leaking-reporter/story?id=12557291&page=1| title = Former CIA Agent Jeffrey Sterling Arrested, Accused of Leaking to Reporter as Revenge - ABC News| date = 2011 06 01 | accessdate = 2011 03 12 | author = Pierre Thomas, et al. | publisher = go.com }}</ref> .

In April 2010, [[Thomas Andrews Drake]], an official with the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), was indicted under the Act for alleged willful retention of national defense information {{uscsub|18|793|e}}.
