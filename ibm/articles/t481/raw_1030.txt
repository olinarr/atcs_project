==Reporting==. 
===Shin Bet and Mossad===. 
Tikun Olam broke the gag order against reporting the arrest of prominent Israeli Palestinian political activists [[Ameer Makhoul]] and [[Omar Said]] by the [[Shin Bet]], who accused them of spying against Israel on behalf of [[Hezbollah]]. Neither detainee was permitted to consult an attorney for several weeks, and Makhoul contends that his alleged confession was extracted under torture. Said pled to a reduced charge and went free. <ref>{{cite news

In 2010, the blog was reportedly the first to publish the names of the candidates for chief of Mossad and Shin Bet. <ref name=ynet20110606>{{cite news|last=Ronen|first=Moshe|title=Richard Silverstein vs. censorship|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4078461,00.html|newspaper=[[Ynetnews]]|date=7 June 2011|quote=The website has become one of the Israeli censorship's biggest problems recently when it featured news items that were under a gag order in the Jewish state.

===Anat Kamm-Uri Blau affair===.

==Reception==. 
''[[The Forward|Forward]]'' reporter Nathan Guttman writes that Silverstein "has become a prime address for Israelis seeking to bypass their country’s censorship or court gag orders... Some praise his work as a courageous effort to tear down walls of secrecy surrounding Israel’s security agencies" while "others accuse him of recklessness motivated by a drive to blemish Israel at all costs." The pro-Israel watchdog group [[Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America|CAMERA]] characterizes Silverstein as a "radical, anti-Israel blogger who repeatedly defends Hamas while blaming the Israeli government, and who promotes Israel as a single state of all its citizens." Silverstein responded that he believes Israel is a Jewish homeland, that he hopes to see equal rights provided for Jewish and Arab citizens in the country and though he is "agnostic" toward the two-state solution would ultimately prefer that outcome. <ref name="forward">{{cite news |title=Blogger Carves Out Niche Baring Israeli Intel Secrets |author=Nathan Guttman |url=http://forward.com/articles/142723/ |newspaper=The Forward |date=13 September 2011 |accessdate=9 January 2012}}</ref> . 

Silverstein is also criticized for his journalistic practices. [[Yossi Melman]], a veteran security and intelligence reporter for ''Haaretz'' argues that Silverstein  "spreads rumors without checking them" and "is an ideologue, not a journalist." He adds, "[Silverstein] is speculative. It is like at the casino: Sometimes he gets it right, and sometimes he doesn’t."<ref name="forward"/><ref name=h20100826>{{cite news |title=Inside Intel / As long as you have your bodyguard |first=Yossi |last=Melman |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/inside-intel-as-long-as-you-have-your-bodyguard-1.310279 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=26 August 2010}}</ref> Nonetheless, Melman writes that "Silverstein’s blog is important because he exposes the security services and the courts in all their nakedness. They use the instruments of the 20th century to protect secrets which aren’t really secrets in the age of 21st century technology."<ref name=Melman>{{cite news

According to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', "The blogger who lives in the United States is considered to be very well informed when it comes to Israeli security matters. His blog "Tikun Olam" regularly exposes stories which cannot be published in Israel due to military censorship. For example, Silverstein was the first to publish the names of new candidates for the senior posts at the Israeli domestic and external security services."<ref>{{cite news
