In the course of the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], the term "focused foiling" / "targeted prevention
" [http://milon.walla.co.il/ts.cgi?tsscript=index&textDir=rtl&dTypeTxt=0-1&srcLang=heb&term=%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%9C+%D7%9E%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A7%D7%93&dTypeSelect=1]({{lang-he|סיכול ממוקד }} ''{{transl|he|sikul memukad}}'') is used by the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) to describe the [[targeted killing]] of a person with proven intentions of performing a specific act of [[violence]] in the very near future, or one linked indirectly with several acts of violence (organizing, planning, researching means of destruction, etc.), which raises the likelihood that his or her death would disrupt similar activities in the future. 
The [[Israeli army]] maintains that it pursues such military operations to prevent imminent attacks when it has no discernible means of making an arrest or foiling such attacks by other methods. On December 14, 2006, the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] ruled that targeted killing is a legitimate form of self-defense against [[terrorist]]s, and outlined several conditions for its use. <ref>[http://elyon1.court.gov.il/Files_ENG/02/690/007/a34/02007690.a34.htm Summary of Israeli Supreme Court Ruling on Targeted Killings] Dec 14, 2006</ref> . 

==Strike methods and well known targeted killings==. 
===Strike methods=== . 

{{Expand section|date=January 2007}}
[[File:AH-64Apache004.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[AH-64 Apache]] [[helicopter gunship]], which is used to carry out many of the targeted killings, due to its ability to shoot [[guided munitions]]]] . 

Many strikes have been carried out by [[Israeli Air Force]] [[attack helicopter]]s (mainly the [[AH-64 Apache]]) that fire [[guided missile]]s toward the target, after the [[Shin Bet]] supplies [[military intelligence|intelligence]] for the target. Sometimes, when heavier bombs are needed, the strike is carried out by [[F-16]] warplanes.  . 

Other strategies employ strike teams of [[Israeli intelligence]] or military operatives. These operatives infiltrate areas known to harbor targeted individuals, and eliminate their assigned targets with [[small arms]] fire or use of [[explosive]]s. [[Sniper]]s have also been utilized, as was in the case of Dr Thabet Thabet in 2001. <ref>Stahl, Adam – "The Evolution of Israel Targeted Operations: Consequences of the Thabet Thabet Operation". ''Studies in Conflict and Terrorism'', 33,2 2010 http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a918535765~db=all~jumptype=rss</ref> . 

[[Unmanned aerial vehicle]] are used for the strikes as well. <ref>[http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/1240454.html מסמכי ויקיליקס: צה"ל משתמש בכלי טיס בלתי מאוישים לחיסול מחבלים]</ref> . 

Regardless of the method used, intelligence on targets is critical. As regards helicopter strikes, orbiting [[UAV]]s or unmanned drones, linked to intelligent monitoring and eavesdropping systems, provide targeting data to assigned strike aircraft. Special care is taken to minimize civilian casualties, and sometimes strikes were aborted if the civilian presence near the target was too large to be politically acceptable.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} .

{{Main|Targeted killing}} . 

Some of the targeted killings by the Israeli military were [[Hamas]] leaders Mahmoud Adani (February 2001), Jamil Jadallah (November 2001), [[Salah Shahade]] (July 2002), [[Sheikh Ahmed Yassin]] (March 2004), [[Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi]] (April 2004) and [[Adnan al-Ghoul]] (October 2004), all targeted in the [[Al-Aqsa Intifada]]. <ref>Stahl, Adam. "Questioning the Efficacy of Israeli Targeted Killings Against Hamas’ Religio-Military Command as a Counter-terrorism Tool." http://www.wm.edu/so/monitor/issues/2006/2006-winter-5-Israel.pdf</ref>  . 

Sheikh Ahmed Yassin was a [[quadriplegic]] and was nearly [[blindness|blind]], and confined to a [[wheelchair]] since a sporting accident at the age of 12. <ref>{{Cite web| url = http://islam.about.com/b/a/073913.htm | title = Sheikh Ahmed Yassin Assassinated by Israel| accessdate =27 March 2012 }}</ref> Yassin had been previously been arrested by the Israelis, in 1989, and sentenced to life imprisonment. <ref>{{Cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/middle_east/2001/israel_and_the_palestinians/profiles/1695470.stm|title = Sheikh Yassin: Spiritual figurehead|accessdate =27 March 2012|date = 22 March 2004|publisher = [[BBC Online]]}}</ref> On 6 September 2003, Israel attempted to assassinate Yassin but he survived. <ref name>{{Cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/09/06/mideast.violence/ | title = Hamas founder targeted in Gaza airstrike| accessdate =27 March 2012 | work=CNN | date=6 September 2003}}</ref> Yassin made no attempt to guard himself from further attempts on his life or hide his location.  Journalists sometimes visited his Gaza address and Yassin maintained a routine daily pattern of activity, including being wheeled every morning to a nearby mosque. <ref>http://www.wordiq.com/definition/Sheikh_Ahmed_Yassin</ref> . 

While the term "targeted killing" usually describes airborne attacks, [[Israeli security forces]] have killed top [[Palestinian militant]]s in the past by other means, although this has never been confirmed officially.  .

==Civilian casualty ratio==. 
The [[civilian casualty ratio]] of the targeted killings was surveyed by ''[[Haaretz]]'' military journalist Amos Harel. In 2002 and 2003, the ratio was 1:1, meaning one civilian killed for every terrorist killed. Harel called this period "the dark days" because of the relatively high civilian death toll as compared to later years. He attributed this to an [[Israeli Air Force]] (IAF) practice of attacking terrorists even when they were located in densely populated areas. While there were always safety rules, argued Harel, these were "bent" at times in view of the target's importance. <ref name=pin>Amos Harel, [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/pinpoint-attacks-on-gaza-more-precise-1.236163 Pinpoint Attacks On Gaza More Precise], Haaretz 30-12-07</ref> . 

The civilian casualty ratio dropped steeply to 1:28 in late 2005, meaning one civilian killed for every 28 terrorists killed. Harel credited this drop to the new IAF chief [[Eliezer Shkedi]]'s policies. The ratio rose again in 2006 to 1:10, a fact that Harel blamed on "several IAF mishaps". However, in 2007 and 2008 the ratio dropped to an unprecedented level of less than 1:30, or 2–3 percent of the total casualties being civilian. <ref name=pin/> Figures showing an improvement from 1:1 in 2002 to 1:30 in 2008 were also cited by ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' journalist Yaakov Katz. <ref name=katz>Yaakov Katz, [http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?ID=193196&R=R1 Analysis: Lies, leaks, death tolls & statistics], ''Jerusalem Post'', 29-10-2010</ref> . 

Professor [[Alan Dershowitz]] of [[Harvard Law School]] stated that the 2008 figure of 1:30 represents the lowest civilian to combatant casualty ratio in history in the setting of combating terrorism. Dershowitz criticized the international media and human rights organizations for not taking sufficient note of it. He also argued that even this figure may be misleading because not all civilians are innocent bystanders. <ref name=dersh>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alan-dershowitz/targeted-killing-is-worki_b_79616.html,|title=Targeted Killing Is Working, So Why Is The Press Not Reporting It?|last=Dershowitz|first=Alan|date=January 3, 2008|work=[[The Huffington Post]]}}</ref> . 

In October 2009, Dershowitz stated that the ratio for Israel's campaign of targeted killings of terrorists stood at 1 civilian for every 28 terrorists. He argued that "this is the best ratio of any country in the world that is fighting asymmetrical warfare against terrorists who hide behind civilians. It is far better than the ratio achieved by Great Britain and the United States in Iraq or Afghanistan, where both nations employ targeted killings of terrorist leaders." Regarding the practices which might have led to this record and the reasons the civilian death rate nevertheless remained above zero, Dershowitz cited Col. [[Richard Kemp]]'s statements on the [[Gaza War]]:<ref>Alan Dershowitz, [http://www.hudson-ny.org/848/the-hypocrisy-of-universal-jurisdiction The Hypocrisy of "Universal Jurisdiction"], Hudson Institute 06-10-2009</ref> . 

<blockquote>[f]rom my knowledge of the IDF and from the extent to which I have been following the current operation, I don’t think there has ever been a time in the history of warfare when any army has made more efforts to reduce civilian casualties and deaths of innocent people than the IDF is doing today in Gaza... Hamas, the enemy they have been fighting, has been trained extensively by Iran and by Hezbollah, to fight among the people, to use the civilian population in Gaza as a human shield... Hamas factor in the uses of the population as a major part of their defensive plan. So even though as I say, Israel, the IDF, has taken enormous steps...to reduce civilian casualties, it is impossible, it is impossible to stop that happening when the enemy has been using civilians as human shields. </blockquote> . 

However, in a July 2011 article published in the ''[[Michigan War Studies Review]]'', "Targeted Killings: A Modern Strategy of the State", A.E. Stahl and William F. Owen wrote that casualty ratios and death counts in general should be initially considered with dubiety.  Stahl and Owen state: "A caveat: reported death counts and casualty ratios should be approached with skepticism. Statistics are too easy to manipulate for political purposes, vitiating arguments based on them."<ref name=pin>Stahl A.E. and Owen, William F, [http://www.miwsr.com/2011-025.aspx], Michigan War Studies Review 06-07-11</ref> . 

The Israeli Human Rights organization [[B'Tselem]] carries out their own investigations on fatalities in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and does not rely on official IDF statistics. According to B'Tselem statistics Israeli targeted killings claimed 425 Palestinian lives between September 2000 and August 2011. Of these, 251 persons (59.1 percent) were the targeted individuals and 174 (40.9 percent) were civilian bystanders. This implies a ratio of civilians to targets of 1:1.44 during the whole period. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://old.btselem.org/statistics/english/ |title = Palestinians killed during the course of a targeted killing in the Occupied Territories, 29.9.2000 – 26.12.2008 | publisher = B’Tselem | date= | accessdate= September 26, 2011}}</ref> . 

==Controversies relating to the strategy of targeted killings==. 
The exact nature of the proof required by the Israelis for the killings is classified, as it involves clandestine [[military intelligence]]-oriented means and operational decisions. However all Mossad targeted killings must have the approval of the Prime Minister. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/my-life-as-a-very-secret-agent-for-mossad/story-e6frg6so-1225832337774 | first=John | last=Lyons | title=My life as a very secret agent for Mossad | date=February 20, 2010}}</ref> Rather than being a part of a published justice system executed by lawyers and judges. [[International law]] provides two distinct normative paradigms which govern targeted killings in situations of law enforcement and the conduct of hostilities. As a form of individualized or surgical warfare, the method of targeted killing requires a "microscopic" interpretation of the law regulating the conduct of hostilities which leads nuanced results reflecting the fundamental principles underlying international humanitarian law. Any targeted killing not directed against a legitimate military target remains subject to the law enforcement paradigm, which imposes extensive restraints on the practice and even under the paradigm of hostilities, no person can be lawfully liquidated without further considerations. <ref>Nils Melzer, ''[[Targeted Killing in International Law]]'' (Oxford Monographs in International Law), Oxford University Press, USA (August 10, 2008)</ref> . 

===Proponents of targeted killings===. 
Proponents of the strategy argue that targeted killings are within the rules of war. They contend they are a measured response to [[terrorism]], that focuses on actual perpetrators of militant attacks, while largely avoiding innocent casualties. They point out  that targeted killings prevented some  attacks against Israeli targets, weakened the effectiveness of militant groups, kept potential bomb makers on the run, and served as deterrence against militant operations. They also argue that targeted killings are less harmful toward Palestinian non-combatants than full-scale military incursion into Palestinian cities. <ref name=ejk1>Efraim Inbar, Merkaz Besa le-meḥḳarim asṭraṭegiyim (2003) Democracies and small wars Taylor & Francis, SBN 0714684236 pp 144, 157</ref>
The IDF claims that targeted killings are only pursued to prevent future terrorism acts, not as revenge for past activities as such they are not extrajudicial. The IDF also claims that this practice is only used when there is absolutely no practical way of foiling the future acts by other means (e.g., arrest) with minimal risk to its soldiers or civilians. The IDF also claims that the practice is only used when there is a certainty in the identification of the target, in order to minimize harm to innocent bystanders. <ref>Stahl, Adam. "Questioning the Efficacy of Israeli Targeted Killings Against Hamas’ Religio-Military Command as a Counter-terrorism Tool." op. cit. </ref> They argue that because many of the Palestinians who have targeted Israel over the years have enjoyed the protection of Arab governments, extraditing them for trial in Israel has often proved impossible. They argue that Israeli governments have long used targeted killings as a last resort, when there were no peaceful options for bringing suspected terrorists to account. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-5294625/Do-Targeted-Killings-Work-Salah.html |title=Do Targeted Killings Work?(Salah Shehada of Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement)) &#124; Goliath Business News |publisher=Goliath.ecnext.com |date= |accessdate=October 1, 2010}}</ref> In a 2010 article in Infinity Journal, it was argued that targeted killings are a strategy that entails "limited, force in support of policy" and that the strategy has proven to work, albeit within specific contexts. <ref>Stahl, A.E. and Owen, William F. "Targeted Killings Work." Infinity Journal. Issue No. 1, Winter 2010, pages 10–13. </ref> The context of the Infinity Journal article related specifically to Hamas' calls for ceasefires and 'calms' in 2004 after the majority of their leadership had been successfully targeted by Israeli forces. According to the article, "Targeted Killings Work", Israeli targeted killings throughout "the 2000–2005 armed rebellion represented a successful strategy" because "the tactics never undermined Israeli policy enough to alter Israel’s overall political objectives" and because Hamas' will to continue with armed violence was temporarily broken. <ref>Stahl, A.E. and Owen, William F. "Targeted Killings Work." op. cit. </ref> . 

===Opponents of targeted killings===. 
Opponents of Israel's policy of targeted killings claim that it violates the [[laws of war]]. They  feel these targeted killings are [[extrajudicial]] and feel that this violates the norms and values of a democratic society. <ref name=ejk1/> . 

Some question whether the IDF claims of no other way is correct and debate the secret process of IDF deliberations. Moreover many feel that actual injury and death of innocent bystanders, unintended as they may be, makes a strong claim against targeted killings. Some hold that such strikes do not reduce terrorism, but encourage more recruits to join militant factions, and are a setback to the [[Middle East peace process]]. <ref name="Daniel Byman 2006, p. 95-112">"Do targeted killings work?", Daniel Byman, Foreign Affairs, March/April 2006, Volume 85, Number 2,  p. 95-112</ref> . 

In 2003, 27 [[Israeli Air Force]] pilots composed a letter of protest to the Air Force commander [[Dan Halutz]], announcing their refusal to continue and perform attacks on targets within Palestinian population centers, and claiming that the occupation of the Palestinians 'morally corrupts the fabric of Israeli society'. <ref name=GM01>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/dec/03/israel Guardian] 'We're air force pilots, not [[mafia]]. We don't take revenge'</ref> After more than 30 signed, 4 later recanted. One, an [[El Al]] pilot, was threaten with dismissal and another lost his civilian job. <ref name=GM01/> . 

{{See also|Refusal to serve in the Israeli military}} . 

===Rule of law===. 
{{Weasel|date=August 2010}}
In 2006, [[Supreme Court of Israel|Israel's Supreme Court]] rejected a petition to declare targeted killings illegal. The court recognized that some killings violated international law, but the legality of individual operations must be assessed on a "case by case basis". <ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6178641.stm | work=BBC News | title=Israel court backs targeted kills | date=December 14, 2006 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref> It also said its decision that caution was needed to prevent civilian casualties. "Innocent civilians should not be targeted," it said. "Intelligence on the (targeted) person's identity must be carefully verified." The court also allowed for the possibility of compensation claims from civilians. <ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6178641.stm BBC. "Israel court backs targeted kills."] Retrieved: August 31, 2009. </ref> . 

Defenders of this practice argue that the [[Palestinian National Authority]] has not lived up to its treaty agreements to crack down on militants and has even aided them in escaping Israeli authorities. <ref>Yedi'ot Aharonot (Tel Aviv), July 12, 2002</ref>  As such in a legal opinion, Israeli attorney general Elyakim Rubinstein wrote:
"The laws of combat which are part of international law, permit injuring, during a period of warlike operations, someone who has been positively identified as a person who is working to carry out fatal attacks against Israeli targets, those people are enemies who are fighting against Israel, with all that implies, while committing fatal terror attacks and intending to commit additional attacks—all without any countermeasures by the PA."<ref>Ha'aretz, Feb. 12, 2001. </ref> . 

It can also be argued that the Palestinian National Authority is not a state and no government recognizes Hamas control in Gaza as such this conflict is not bound by the set of norms, rules, and treaties with which many states conflict occur. <ref>http://www.meforum.org/515/the-logic-of-israels-targeted-killing</ref> But even if it were argued that a state conflict is said to exist many say it is in accordance with the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] ([[s:Fourth Geneva Convention#Article 28|Part 3, Article 1, Section 28]]) which reads: “The presence of a protected person may not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations,” and so they argue that international law explicitly gives Israel the right to conduct military operations against military targets under these circumstances. <ref>{{cite news

Those who are actually fighting the war are not considered "protected persons." Only civilians are granted the status of "protected persons" whose rights cannot be violated with impunity. The Fourth Geneva Convention convicts Hamas and Salah Shehada in one sentence. That sentence makes up the entirety of Part 3, Article 1, Section 28. It reads: "The presence of a protected person may not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations." This sentence appears in the Fourth Geneva Convention precisely to deal with situations like the ones the Israelis faced.

Poll published by ''[[Maariv]]'' newspaper in July 2001, found that 90 percent of Israeli public support the practice. The belief that targeted killings is the appropriate response to terror attacks appears to be nearly-universal. <ref name=ejk1>Efraim Inbar, Merkaz Besa le-meḥḳarim asṭraṭegiyim (2003) Democracies and small wars Taylor & Francis, SBN 0714684236 pp 144</ref> . 

==Effectiveness of Palestinian attacks and the Israeli response==. 
===Strong damage caused by Palestinian attacks=== . 

Palestinian attacks against Israel have been costly for Israel. IDF reports show that from the start of the [[Second Intifada]] (in 2000) to the Year 2005, Palestinians killed 1,074 Israelis and wounded 7,520. These are serious figures for such a small country, roughly equivalent to 50,000 dead and 300,000 wounded in the United States over five years. Such losses generated immense public pressure from the Israeli public for a forceful response, and ramped up targeted killings were one such outcome. <ref name="Daniel Byman 2006, p. 95-112"/> . 

===Statistics on hit policy effectiveness in reducing attacks=== . 

But while Palestinian operations caused strong damage, there is evidence that the IDF reprisal [[targeted killing]] policy has been salutary in reducing the effectiveness of such attacks although  it increased the number of HAMAS attacks between 2001 and 2005. <ref>Stahl, op. cit. </ref> Although the total number of Hamas operations increased, deaths resulting from such attacks plunged from a high of 75 in 2001, to 21 in 2005. <ref>Byman, op. cit. </ref> . 

For example, after the targeting of [[Yassin]] in 2004 there was a severe increase in the number of attacks carried out (an increase of 299 attacks) yet there were only 4 suicide attacks, a decrease from the previous year. <ref>Stahl, op. cit. Pp 14–15</ref> According to the report by A.E. Stahl, a Research Fellow at the [[International Institute for Counter-Terrorism]], following the targeted operation against Yassin, "Suicide terrorism by Hamas decreased by ﬁve and the total number of deaths caused by suicidal terrorism also declined by 19.  Though the total number of attacks increased the total number of deaths decreased severely: attacks rose by  299 but deaths fell by 27."<ref>Stahl, op. cit. Pp 14–15</ref> . 

[[Targeted killings]] may also have been effective, as is witnessed in the political reactions of HAMAS. Stipulations were demanded by HAMAS in the form of ''Tahadiyehs'' and ''Hudnas''. It seems HAMAS was “forced to operate at reduced levels of efficiency” and was eventually forced to agree to a ''Tahadiyeh'', likely due to targeted killings. <ref>Frisch, Hillel. “Motivation or Capabilities?

===Hits versus other intervening factors in analyzing effectiveness of Israeli strikes=== . 

There are several practical reasons why calculated hits may weaken the effectiveness of terrorist activities. Targeted killings physically eliminate skilled terrorists, bomb makers, forgers, recruiters and other operatives, who need time to develop expertise. Targeted hits also disrupt the opponent's infrastructure and organization, and cause immense stress on individual leaders and fighters, who must constantly move, switch locations and hide. This reduces the flow of information in the terrorist organization and reduces its effectiveness. Targeted killings may also serve as a demoralizing agent. Targeted individuals cannot visit their wives, children, relatives or families without severe risk, and may even shirk their names coming out in public for fear of liquidation as Israeli killings of Hamas leaders [[Ahmed Yassin]] and [[Abdelaziz Rantisi]] caused Hamas to not publicly identify their replacement, a necessary step to secure his survival.  . 

Continual diplomatic pressure against the Israeli policy, and the announcement of periodic unilateral cease fires at various times by Hamas, are seen by some as further proof of the policy's efficacy. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} .
