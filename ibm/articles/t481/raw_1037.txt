An '''extrajudicial killing''' is the killing of a person by governmental authorities without the sanction of any [[Judiciary|judicial proceeding]] or legal process. [[Extrajudicial punishment]]s are by their nature unlawful, since they bypass the [[due process]] of the legal jurisdiction in which they occur. Extrajudicial killings often target leading political, trade union, dissident, religious, and social figures and may be carried out by the state government or other state authorities like the armed forces and police.  . 

Extrajudicial killings and [[death squad]]s are common in the [[Middle East]] (mostly in [[Palestinian territories]] ([[Israel]]) and [[Iraq]]<ref>[http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&code=FUL20051124&articleId=1315 Torture and Extrajudicial Killings in Iraq]</ref><ref>[http://www.electronicintifada.net/bytopic/extrajudicial-killings.shtml ei: Extrajudicial Killings]</ref><ref>[http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engamr510792005 USA: An Extrajudicial Execution by the CIA? | Amnesty International] {{dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.brusselstribunal.org/FullerKillings.htm Proof of US orchestration of Death Squads Killings in Iraq]</ref><ref>[http://soccerdad.baltiblogs.com/archives/2007/06/24/extrajudicial_killings_hamas_style.html Soccer Dad: Extra-judicial killings, hamas style]</ref>), Central America,<ref name=autogenerated3>[http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/US_ThirdWorld/deathsquads_ElSal.html El Salvador death squads]</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>[http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGAMR290151996?open&of=ENG-SLV Document Information | Amnesty International] {{dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/publications/elsalvador2/index.html El Salvador: War, Peace, and Human Rights, 1980–1994]</ref> [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]],<ref>[http://www.allamericanpatriots.com/48723123_world_bangladesh_release_journalist_and_rights_activist Bangladesh: Release Journalist and Rights Activist | All American Patriots]</ref> [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]],<ref>

[[Image:Nguyen.jpg|right|thumb|500px|[[Eddie Adams (photographer)|Eddie Adams]]'s Pulitzer Prize-winning photo of General Nguyễn Ngọc Loan executing Nguyễn Văn Lém, a Viet Cong officer.]] . 

== Cold-war practice ==. 
The former [[Soviet Union]] and [[Communist Bloc]] countries used to kill dissidents extrajudicially during the 1930s. 
[[Nguyễn Văn Lém]] (referred to as Captain Bay Lop) (died 1 February 1968 in  Saigon) was a member of the [[Viet Cong]] who was summarily shot in [[Saigon]] during the [[Tet Offensive]]. The photograph of his death would become one of many anti-[[Vietnam War]] icons in the [[Western World]].  . 

During the 1960s and throughout the 1970s, death squads were used against the [[Viet Cong]] cadre as well as supporters in neighbouring countries (notably [[Cambodia]]).  See also [[Phoenix Program]] (also known as Phung Hoang). The [[Viet Cong]] also used death squads of their own against civilians for political reasons.  . 

[[Argentina]] used extrajudicial killings as way of crushing the [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[communist]] opposition to the [[military junta]] during the '[[Dirty war]]' of the late 1960s and most of the 1970s. [[Alianza Anticomunista Argentina]] was a far-right death squad mainly active during the "Dirty War". The [[Chile]]an Junta of 1973 to 1992 also committed such killings; see [[Operation Condor]] for examples.  . 

During the [[El Salvador Civil War|Salvadoran civil war]], death squads achieved notoriety when far-right vigilantes assassinated Archbishop [[Óscar Romero]] for his social activism in March 1980. In December 1980, three American nuns, [[Ita Ford]], [[Dorothy Kazel]], and [[Maura Clarke]], and a lay worker, [[Jean Donovan]], were raped and murdered by a military unit later found to have been acting on specific orders.  Death squads were instrumental in killing hundreds of peasants and activists, including such notable priests as [[Rutilio Grande]].  Because the death squads involved were found to have been soldiers of the Salvadoran military, which was receiving U.S. funding and training from American advisors during the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration,<ref name=autogenerated3 /> these events prompted outrage in the U.S. and led to a temporary cutoff in military aid from the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration  {{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}, although Death Squad activity stretched well into the Reagan years (1981–1989) as well.  . 

Honduras also had death squads active through the 1980s, the most notorious of which was [[Battalion 316]].  Hundreds of people, including teachers, politicians and union bosses, were assassinated by government-backed forces. Battalion 316 received substantial support and training from the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. <ref>[http://www.baltimoresun.com/bal-negroponte1a,0,1240201.story??track=sto-relcon When a wave of torture and murder staggered a small U.S. ally, truth was a casualty. – Prisons, California, Ronald Wilson Reagan – baltimoresun.com]</ref> . 

== Iran ==. 
During the 1950s a regime was put in power through the efforts of the [[CIA]], in which the Shah (hereditary monarch) used [[SAVAK]] death squads to kill thousands. After the revolution death squads were used by the new regime. In 1983 the [[CIA]] gave one of the leaders of Iran [[Khomeni]] information on [[KGB]] agents in Iran. This information was probably used.The Iranian regime later used death squads occasionally throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s however by the 2000s it has appeared to almost entirely if not all cease their operation. This partial [[Westernization]] of the country can be seen paralleling similar events in [[Lebanon]], [[United Arab Emirates]], and Northern [[Iraq]] beginning in the late 1990s .

== Iraq ==. 
[[Iraq]] was formed by the partition and domination of various tribal lands by the British in the early 20th century. Britain granted independence to Iraq in 1932, on the urging of [[King Faisal]], though the British retained military bases and transit rights for their forces. [[King Ghazi]] of Iraq ruled as a figurehead after King Faisal's death in 1933, while undermined by attempted military coups, until his death in 1939. The United Kingdom invaded Iraq in 1941 (see [[Anglo-Iraqi War]]), for fear that the government of [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani]] might cut oil supplies to Western nations, and because of his links to the [[Axis powers]]. A military occupation followed the restoration of the Hashemite monarchy, and the occupation ended on October 26, 1947. Iraq was left with a national government led from [[Baghdad]] made up of [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] ethnicity in key positions of power, ruling over an ad-hoc nation splintered by tribal affiliations. This leadership used death squads and committed massacres in Iraq throughout the 20th century, culminating in the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein. <ref>[http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/9/13/14133/1410/ Daily Kos: History of Iraq: 1933 – 1939]</ref> . 

The country has since become increasingly partitioned following the [[Iraq War]] into three zones: a [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdish ethnic zone]] to the north, a Sunni center and the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] ethnic zone to the south. The [[Secularism|secular]] [[Arab socialism|Arab socialist]] [[Ba'ath Party|Baathist]] leadership were replaced with a provisional and later constitutional government that included leadership roles for the Shia and Kurdish peoples of the nation. This paralleled the development of ethnic militias by the Shia, Sunni, and the Kurdish ([[Peshmerga]]).  . 

There were death squads formed by members of every ethnicity. <ref>{{Cite news |title=U.S. cracks down on Iraq death squads |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/07/24/iraq.main/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=2006-07-24}}</ref> In the national capital of Baghdad some members of the now-Shia police department and army (and militia members posing as members of police or armed forces) formed unofficial, unsanctioned, but long-tolerated death squads. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,,1869439,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=US patrols to weed out militias posing as Iraqi police | first=Peter | last=Beaumont | date=September 11, 2006 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref> They possibly have links to the Interior Ministry and are popularly known as the 'black crows'. These groups operated night or day.

The victims of these attacks were predominantly young males who had probably been suspected of being members of the Sunni [[insurgency]]. Agitators such as Abdul Razaq al-Na'as, Dr. Abdullateef al-Mayah, and Dr. Wissam Al-Hashimi have also been killed. These killings are not limited to only men; women and children have also been arrested and/or killed. <ref>{{Cite news |title='25,000 civilians' killed in Iraq |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4692589.stm |publisher=BBC |date=2005-07-19}}</ref> Some of these killings have also been simple robberies or other criminal activities.  . 

A feature in a May 2005 issue of the magazine of the''New York Times'' claimed that the U.S. military had modelled the "Wolf Brigade", the Iraqi interior ministry police commandos, on the death squads used in the 1980s to crush the left-wing insurgency in [[El Salvador]]. <ref name=Nytimes050501>{{cite news |title=The Way of the Commandos |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/01/magazine/01ARMY.html?ei=5088&en=f0604488a64924cd&ex=1272686400&pagewanted=all&position= |publisher=The New York Times |date=2005-05-01 | first=Peter | last=Maass | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref> . 

Western news organizations such as [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] and [[People (magazine)|''People'']] disassembled this by focusing on the aspects such as probable [[militia]] membership, religious ethnicity, as well as uniforms worn by these squads rather than stating the [[United States]]-backed Iraqi government had death squads active in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4719252.stm | work=BBC News | title=Iraq 'death squad caught in act' | date=February 16, 2006 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref> .

The [[Philippines]] has had its share of extrajudicial atrocities and related political violence as well, the most recent being the [[Maguindanao massacre]] in [[Mindanao]] (November 2009). The [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] (CPJ) has called the massacre the single deadliest event for [[journalists]] in history. <ref name=pdi>{{cite news|first=Alcuin|last=Papa|title=Maguindanao massacre worst-ever for journalists |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20091126-238554/Maguindanao-massacre-worst-ever-for-journalists |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|publisher=|date=2009-11-26 |accessdate=2010-09-30}}</ref> Even prior to this, the CPJ had labeled the [[Philippines]] the second most dangerous country for journalists, second only to [[Iraq]]. <ref name=pdi/> .

During the [[Irish war of independence]] in 1916–21, the British forces organised several secret assassination squads.

On September 30, 2011 a drone strike in Yemen killed American citizens [[Anwar al-Awlaki]] and Samir Khan. Both individuals resided in [[Yemen]] at the time of their deaths. The executive order approving al-Awlaki's death was issued by the [[Obama administration]] in 2010 and challenged by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] in that year. The U.S. President issued an order, approved by the [[National Security Council]] that al-Awlaki's normal legal rights as a civilian should be suspended and his death should be imposed, as he was a threat to the United States. The reasons provided to the public for approval of the order was Al-Awlaki's links to the 2009 [[Fort Hood shooting|Fort Hood Massacre]] and the [[2009 Christmas Day bomb plot]], the attempted destruction of a Detroit-bound passenger-plane. <ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/7564581/Barack-Obama-orders-killing-of-US-cleric-Anwar-al-Awlaki.html | work=The Telegraph| title=Barack Obama orders killing of US cleric Anwar al-Awlaki | date=April 7, 2010 | location=London | first=Tom | last=Leonard}}</ref>
