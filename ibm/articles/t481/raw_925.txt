{{Criminal defenses}}
In [[civil proceeding]]s and [[criminal prosecution]]s under the [[common law]], a [[defendant]] may raise a '''defense''' (or '''defence''') in an attempt to avoid criminal or civil [[legal liability|liability]]. Besides contesting the accuracy of any [[allegation]] made against him or her in a criminal or civil proceeding, a defendant may also make allegations against the prosecutor or plaintiff or raise a defense, arguing that, even if the allegations against the defendant are true, the defendant is nevertheless not liable.  . 

Since a defense is raised by the defendant in a direct attempt to avoid what would otherwise result in liability, the defendant typically holds the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]].  For example, if a defendant in an [[assault]] and [[battery (crime)|battery]] case attempts to claim [[provocation (legal)|provocation]], the victim of said assault and battery would not have to prove that he did not provoke the plaintiff; the defendant would have to prove that the plaintiff did.  .

In [[common law]], a defendant may raise any of the numerous defenses to limit or avoid liability. These include:
* Lack of [[Personal jurisdiction|personal]] or [[subject matter jurisdiction]] of the court, such as [[diplomatic immunity]]. 
* Failure to state a [[cause of action]] or other insufficiencies of [[pleading]]. 
* Any of the [[affirmative defense]]s. 
* Defenses conferred by statute - such as a [[statute of limitations]] or the [[statute of frauds]]. 
* ''[[Ex turpi causa non oritur actio]]'' - the action against the defendant arises from an illegality. 
* ''[[Volenti non fit injuria]]'' - [[consent]] by the victim or plaintiff.  . 

In addition to defenses against prosecution and liability, a defendant may also raise a defense of [[justification (jurisprudence)|justification]] - such as [[Right of self-defense|self-defense and defense of others]] or [[defense of property]].  . 

==Costs== . 

Litigation is expensive and often may last for months or years.  Parties can finance their litigation and pay for their attorneys' fees or other legal costs in a number of ways.  Defendants can pay with their own money, through [[legal defense funds]], or [[legal financing]] companies.  .
