''The New York Times'' described the leak as "a six-year archive of classified military documents [that] offers an unvarnished and grim picture of the Afghan war". ''The Guardian'' called the material "one of the biggest leaks in U.S. military history&nbsp;... a devastating portrait of the failing [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]], revealing how coalition forces have killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents, Taliban attacks have soared and [[NATO]] commanders fear neighbouring Pakistan and Iran are fuelling the insurgency". <ref name=GuardianLeaks/>  ''Der Spiegel'' wrote that "the editors in chief of ''Spiegel'', ''The New York Times'' and the ''Guardian'' were 'unanimous in their belief that there is a justified public interest in the material'."<ref name="Spiegel1" /> . 

Some time after the first dissemination by WikiLeaks, the US Justice Department were considering the use of the U.S. [[Espionage Act]] of 1917 to prevent WikiLeaks from posting the remaining 15,000 secret war documents it claimed to possess. <ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/17/AR2010081705225.html | work=The Washington Post | title=The Justice Department weighs a criminal case against WikiLeaks | date=18 August 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://news.oneindia.in/2010/08/18/us-to-use-espionage-act-against-wikileaks.html "US to use Espionage Act against WikiLeaks"]</ref><ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/espionage-act-of-1917 "Espionage Act of 1917"]</ref> . 

==Background==. 
{{Main|Wikileaks}} . 

In June 2010, Guardian journalist [[Nick Davies]] and WikiLeaks founder [[Julian Assange]] established that the US army had built a huge database with six years of sensitive military intelligence material, to which many thousands of US soldiers had access and some of them had been able to download copies, and WikiLeaks had one copy which it proposed to publish online, via a series of uncensorable global servers. <ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/aug/02/afghan-war-logs-wikileaks | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=David | last=Leigh | title=Afghan War Logs: what did we learn? | date=2 August 2010}}</ref>  . 

Wikileaks describes itself as "a multi-jurisdictional public service designed to protect whistleblowers, journalists and activists who have sensitive materials to communicate to the public."<ref name="about-wikileaks">{{cite web | title=WikiLeaks:About | url=http://wikileaks.org/wiki/WikiLeaks:About | publisher=[[Wikileaks]] | accessdate=29 July 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100730023422/http://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks:About| archivedate= 30 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In an interview with the U.K.'s [[Channel 4]], Wikileaks founder Julian Assange said that "we have a stated commitment to a particular kind of process and objective, and that commitment is to get censored material out and never to take it down." He contrasted the group with other media outlets by saying that "other journalists try to verify sources. We don't do that, we verify documents. We don't care where it came from." He denied that the group has an inherent bias against the Afghanistan War, saying that "We don't have a view about whether the war should continue or stop&nbsp;– we do have a view that it should be prosecuted as humanely as possible." However, he also said that he believes the leaked information will turn world public opinion to think more negatively of the war. <ref name=tells-all /> . 

An Obama administration statement disputed the self-reported status of WikiLeaks, stating that it "is not an objective news outlet but rather an organization that opposes U.S. policy in Afghanistan."<ref name=arabiya>{{cite news | url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2010/07/26/114847.html | title=Washington condemns leak of Afghan war files | newspaper=[[Al Arabiya]] | date=26 July 2010 | accessdate=26 July 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100729135943/http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2010/07/26/114847.html| archivedate= 29 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Journalist Will Heaven of ''The Daily Telegraph'' has said that WikiLeaks was not politically neutral when it fed its information to the left-leaning newspapers ''The Guardian'', ''The New York Times'', and ''Der Spiegel'' instead of releasing the data openly. He said that the selectivity of the leak "contravene[d] its own mission statement&nbsp;– that crowdsourcing and open data are paramount."<ref>{{cite news | first=Will | last=Heaven | title=Wikileaks is a website without an agenda, says Julian Assange.

==Issues raised==. 
===Allegations of foreign support for the Taliban===. 
====Pakistan====. 
According to ''Der Spiegel'', "the documents clearly show that the Pakistani intelligence agency [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (usually known as the ISI) is the most important accomplice the Taliban has outside of Afghanistan."<ref name=Spiegel2>{{cite news | first1=Matthias | last1=Gebauer | first2=John | last2=Goetz | first3=Hans | last3=Hoyng | first4=Susanne | last4=Koelbl | first5=Marcel | last5=Rosenbach | first6=Gregor Peter | last6=Schmitz | title=Explosive Leaks Provide Image of War from Those Fighting It: The Secret Enemy in Pakistan | newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]] | date={{Nowrap|25 July}} 2010 | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,708314-5,00.html | accessdate={{Nowrap|26 July}} 2010}}</ref> ''The New York Times'' was especially alarmed by the level of collusion with the Taliban, having concluded that Pakistan "allows representatives of its spy service to meet directly with the Taliban in secret strategy sessions to organize networks of militant groups that fight against American soldiers in Afghanistan, and even hatch plots to assassinate Afghan leaders." ''The Guardian'', however, did not think there was "a convincing smoking gun" for complicity between [[Inter-Services Intelligence|Pakistan intelligence services]] and the Taliban. <ref>{{cite news | first1=Kimberly | last1=Dozier | title=Leaked tales from the front lines paint dark portrait of Afghanistan  | newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] | agency=[[Associated Press]] | date={{Nowrap|26 July}} 2010 | url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/us-condemns-massive-military-leak-exposing-dark-side-of-afghan-war/article1651348/ | accessdate={{Nowrap|26 July}} 2010 | location=Toronto}}</ref> . 

In particular, the leaks discuss an alleged incident in which Pakistan's former ISI spy chief [[Hamid Gul]] met with Afghan insurgents in January 2009, occurring right after alleged Pakistani al-Qaeda figure Osama al-Kini's death by a CIA drone attack. "The meeting attendees were saddened by the news of Zamarai's death and discussed plans to complete Zamarai's last mission by facilitating the movement of a suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive device from Pakistan to Afghanistan through the Khan Pass," leaked reports said. ''The New York Times'' stated that it could not confirm whether or not that the attack ever took place. <ref name=arabiya/> . 

The initial web article in ''The New York Times'' on the subject, appearing 25 July was written by Mark Mazzetti, Jane Perlez, Eric Schmitt, and Andrew Lehren, and titled "Pakistan Spy Service Aids Insurgents, Reports Assert". It was the lead article in the 26 July print edition of the ''Times''. <ref>{{cite news | first1=Mark | last1=Mazzetti | first2=Jane | last2=Perlez | first3=Eric | last3=Schmitt | first4=Andrew W. | last4=Lehren | title=Pakistan Spy Service Aids Insurgents, Reports Assert | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date={{Nowrap|25 July}} 2010 | url=http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/world/war-logs.html | accessdate={{Nowrap|26 July}} 2010}}</ref> The article provided a wide range of excerpts from the paper, at some points focusing on coalition successes, and at other times excerpting sections that highlighted coalition failures. Many of the excerpts illustrated American frustration with local involvement, quoting the sources, noting that "glimpses of what appear to be Pakistani skullduggery contrast sharply with the frequently rosy public pronouncements of Pakistan as an ally by American officials." . 

"The Guardian" has a very different take on this. Its Sunday, 25 July 2010 article by Declan Walsh states: "But for all their eye-popping details, the intelligence files, which are mostly collated by junior officers relying on informants and Afghan officials, fail to provide a convincing smoking gun for ISI complicity. Most of the reports are vague, filled with incongruent detail, or crudely fabricated. The same characters – famous Taliban commanders, well-known ISI officials – and scenarios repeatedly pop up. And few of the events predicted in the reports subsequently occurred. A retired senior American officer said ground-level reports were considered to be a mixture of "rumours, bullshit and second-hand information" and were weeded out as they passed up the chain of command."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/25/pakistan-isi-accused-taliban-afghanistan | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Declan | last=Walsh | title=Afghanistan war logs: Clandestine aid for Taliban bears Pakistan's fingerprints | date=25 July 2010}}</ref>   . 

The [[Obama administration]], in response to the leaks, re-expressed their long-held doubts about links between Pakistan intelligence agents and Afghan insurgents. An anonymous official said to [[Al Arabiya]], "I don't think anyone who follows this issue will find it surprising that there are concerns about ISI and safe havens in Pakistan. <ref name=arabiya/> . 

====Iran====. 
Evidence that [[Iran]] provided extensive assistance to the [[Taliban]] was also revealed. Coming from sources such as Afghan spies and paid informants, Iranian involvement in Afghanistan steadily widened from 2004 to today and constituted armaments, money, and physical deployment of anti-NATO militants. <ref name="iran-accus">{{cite news | first=Simon | last=Tisdall | title=Afghanistan war logs: Iran's covert operations in Afghanistan | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date={{Nowrap|25 July}} 2010 | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/25/iran-backing-taliban-alqaida-afghanistan | accessdate={{Nowrap|26 July}} 2010 | location=London}}</ref>  Iran denies supporting the militants. <ref name="iran-accus"/> . 

====North Korea====. 
The documents, wrote journalist [[Jeff Stein (author)|Jeff Stein]] of the ''[[Washington Post]]'', stated that [[Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin|Hezb-e-Islami party]] leader [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]] and Amin al-Haq, a financial advisor to [[Osama Bin Ladin]], both flew to [[North Korea]] on 19 November 2005, and purchased remote controlled rockets to be used against American and coalition aircraft. Stein cautioned that he has found no corroborating reports of North Korean involvement in Taliban armaments dealing. <ref>{{cite news | first=Jeff | last=Stein | authorlink=Jeff Stein (author) | title=Wikileaks documents: N.

===Civilian casualties===. 
{{see|Civilian casualties of the War in Afghanistan (2001–present)}}
Hundreds of civilians have been wounded or killed by coalition forces in several instances that were not previously revealed. <ref name=GuardianLeaks>{{cite news | first1=Nick | last1=Davies | authorlink1=Nick Davies | first2=David | last2=Leigh | authorlink2=David Leigh | title=Afghanistan war logs: Massive leak of secret files exposes truth of occupation | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date={{Nowrap|25 July}} 2010 | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/25/afghanistan-war-logs-military-leaks | accessdate={{Nowrap|26 July}} 2010 | location=London}}</ref><ref name=GuardianCivilians>{{cite news | first1=David | last1=Leigh | first2=Rob | last2=Evans | title=Afghanistan war logs: Civilians caught in firing line of British troops | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date={{Nowrap|25 July}} 2010 | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/25/british-troops-afghan-civilian-shootings?intcmp=239 | accessdate={{Nowrap|26 July}} 2010 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Stephen | last=Foley | title=Whistleblower's leaked US files reveal state of Afghan war | newspaper=[[The Independent]] | date={{Nowrap|26 July}} 2010 | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/whistleblowers-leaked-us-files-reveal-state-of-afghan-war-2035547.html | accessdate={{Nowrap|26 July}} 2010 | location=London}}</ref>  The press listed several examples of such previously unreported incidents of civilian injuries and deaths. <ref name=GuardianCivillians>{{cite news | first=David | last=Leigh | title=Afghanistan war logs: Secret CIA paramilitaries' role in civilian deaths | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date={{Nowrap|25 July}} 2010 | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/25/afghanistan-civilian-deaths-rules-engagement | accessdate={{Nowrap|26 July}} 2010 | location=London}}</ref> [[David Leigh]] of ''The Guardian'' wrote: {{blockquote|They range from the shootings of individual innocents to the often massive loss of life from air strikes, which eventually led President [[Hamid Karzai]] to protest publicly that the US was treating Afghan lives as "cheap".

In one incident, a U.S. patrol machine-gunned a bus, wounding or killing 15 of its passengers. <ref>{{cite news | first1=Katherine | last1=Faulkner | title=British fury as Wikileaks publishes the 90,000 top secret files that expose the horrific civilian cost of Afghan war | newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] | date={{Nowrap|26 July}} 2010 | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1297644/Wikileaks-publishes-90-000-documents-Afghan-war.html | accessdate={{Nowrap|26 July}} 2010 | location=London}}</ref> . 

On 4 March 2007, in the [[2007 Shinwar shooting|Shinwar shooting]], [[U.S. Marines]] opened fire on civilians after witnessing a [[suicide bombing]] and supposedly coming under small arms fire. ''The Guardian'' reported their actions: "The marines made a frenzied escape [from the scene of the bombing], opening fire with automatic weapons as they tore down a six-mile stretch of highway, hitting almost anyone in their way&nbsp;– teenage girls in the fields, motorists in their cars, old men as they walked along the road. Nineteen unarmed civilians were killed and 50 wounded." The military report of the incident (written by the same soldiers involved in it) later failed to make any reference to the deaths and injuries and none of the soldiers involved were charged or disciplined. <ref>{{cite news | first=Declan | last=Walsh | title=Afghanistan war logs: How US marines sanitised record of bloodbath | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date={{Nowrap|26 July}} 2010 | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/26/afghanistan-war-logs-us-marines | accessdate={{Nowrap|26 July}} 2010 | location=London}}</ref> . 

On 21 March 2007, CIA paramilitaries fired on a civilian man who was running from them. The man, Shum Khan, was [[deaf]] and [[Muteness|mute]] and did not hear their warnings. <ref name=GuardianCivillians/><ref name=deafmute>{{cite news | title=Afghanistan war logs: "Other government agency" shoots deaf mute | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date={{Nowrap|25 July}} 2010 | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/afghanistan/warlogs/0B4F081B-E448-4722-9E52-EA10DE4E0153 | accessdate={{Nowrap|26 July}} 2010 | location=London}}</ref> . 

In 2007, documents detail how US special forces dropped six 2,000&nbsp;lb bombs on a compound where they believed a “high-value individual” was hiding, after “ensuring there were no innocent Afghans in the surrounding area”. A senior U.S. commander reported that 150 Taliban had been killed. Locals, however, reported that up to 300 civilians had died. <ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news | url=http://blog.dawn.com/2010/07/27/the-isi-america%E2%80%99s-favourite-scapegoat/ | title=The ISI: America’s favourite scapegoat | newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] | date=27 July 2010 | accessdate=28 July 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100802004823/http://blog.dawn.com/2010/07/27/the-isi-america%E2%80%99s-favourite-scapegoat/| archivedate= 2 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> . 

On 16 August 2007, [[Nangar Khel incident|Polish troops mortared the village of Nangar Khel]], killing five people &mdash; including a [[pregnant]] woman and her baby &mdash; in what ''The Guardian'' describes as an apparent revenge attack shortly after experiencing an [[Improvised explosive device|IED]] explosion. <ref name=GuardianCivillians/><ref>{{cite news | title=Afghanistan war logs: Polish attack on village kills five, wounds several, including pregnant woman at wedding party | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date={{Nowrap|25 July}} 2010 | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/afghanistan/warlogs/5EA14116-2B6B-470C-8DB4-2912DDF197BF | accessdate={{Nowrap|26 July}} 2010 | location=London}}</ref> . 

According to ''The Guardian'', the logs also detail "how the Taliban have caused growing carnage with a massive escalation of their roadside bombing campaign, which has killed more than 2,000 civilians to date". <ref name=GuardianLeaks /> . 

===Friendly-fire casualties===. 
A significant number of documents describe unreported or previously misleading [[friendly fire]] incidents between Afghan police and army forces, coalition forces, and the U.S. military.  . 

A document dating 3 September 2006 suggests that four [[Canada|Canadian]] soldiers died in the [[Panjwaye District]] of Afghanistan during [[Operation Medusa]], when an American jet dropped a bomb on a building they occupied during the second day of the operation. Seven other Canadian soldiers and one civilian were also reported to have been wounded in the attack. <ref name="cbc-friendly-fire">{{cite news | title=Military rejects WikiLeaks friendly fire report | newspaper=[[CBC News]] | date={{Nowrap|26 July}} 2010 | url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/07/26/wikileak-afghanistan-canada-soldiers.html | accessdate={{Nowrap|27 July}} 2010}}</ref> At the time, the Canadian military reported that the deaths and injuries were caused by a firefight with the Taliban, which it still insists. Michel Drapeau, a former colonel with the Canadian Forces, commented that the document is disturbing, due to it differing from the military's report at the time of the soldiers' deaths, which could make the document incorrect.

===Role of al-Qaeda===. 
The war logs made clear that [[suicide bombing]], normally carried out by non-Afghan, foreign fighters, was increasing and claim that they were nurtured by [[al-Qaeda]] and [[Osama bin Laden]], whose influence was pervasive and possibly growing. A report generated September 2004 stated that terrorists had been assigned by Bin Laden to conduct a suicidal attack against the Afghan president Hamid Karzai, during a press conference or a meeting held. Another report, in September 2008, spoke of co-ordinated, multinational al-Qaeda attack planning. More suicide bombings allegedly were planned with al-Qaeda's Afghan allies, such as the Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin militia led by the notorious warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. Numerous reports linked Bin Laden and al-Qaeda to insurgent activities. In one report, al-Qaeda was also claimed to be involved in a plan to manufacture [[chemical weapons]] payloads for rocket-propelled grenades. <ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/26/afghanistan-war-logs-osama-bin-laden | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Simon | last=Tisdall | title=Afghanistan war logs reveal hand of Osama bin Laden | date=26 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/afghanistan/warlogs/772DE21C-2219-0B3F-9F29789162135989 | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Afghanistan war logs: Al-Qaida alleged to be involved in rocket smuggling | date=25 July 2010}}</ref> . 

===Role of Special Ops greater than previously revealed===. 
Government accounts of coalition activity were, according to ''The Guardian'', sometimes "misleading".  The British paper cited as an example a press statement that concealed the fact that the real reason for a coalition presence in a particular area was because a group known as [[Task Force 373]] was on a mission to kill or capture [[Abu Laith al-Libi]]. <ref>{{cite news | first=Nick | last=Davies | title=Afghanistan war logs: Task Force 373&nbsp;– special forces hunting top Taliban | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date={{Nowrap|25 July}} 2010 | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/25/task-force-373-secret-afghanistan-taliban | accessdate={{Nowrap|26 July}} 2010 | location=London}}</ref>  ''The New York Times'' reported that the U.S. had given Afghans credit for missions actually carried out by Special Operations commandos.  ''The New York Times'' said "over all, the documents do not contradict official accounts of the war. But in some cases the documents show that the American military made misleading public statements". <ref name="nyt">{{cite news | title=Inside the Fog of War: Reports From the Ground in Afghanistan | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date={{Nowrap|25 July}} 2010 | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/26/world/asia/26warlogs.html | accessdate={{Nowrap|26 July}} 2010}}</ref> . 

The records log 144 incidents regarding Task Force 373 and involving Afghan civilian casualties, including 195 deaths. <ref name=BinLaden /> . 

===Detainment facilities and procedures===. 
{{See|Bagram torture and prisoner abuse}}
The leak lends hard numbers such as prisoner head counts and prisoner transfer dates to existing journalistic concerns around certain detainment facilities, such as [[Bagram Theater Internment Facility]], and their practices. <ref>{{cite news | first=David | last=Rose | title=Why Bagram is Guantanamo's evil twin and Britain's dirty secret | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1232665/Why-Bagram-Guantanamos-evil-twin-Britains-dirty-secret.html | newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] | date=9 December 2009 | accessdate=28 July 2010 | location=London}}</ref> . 

===Taliban use of heat-seeking missiles===. 
''The New York Times'' reported that the documents reveal the Taliban have used [[heat-seeking missile]]s to [[List of Coalition aircraft losses in Afghanistan|down coalition aircraft]].  The U.S. military had not previously acknowledged that the Taliban possessed these weapons. <ref name="nyt"/> . 

===Informants named===. 
Some, including [[Barack Obama]] and [[Hamid Karzai]], raised concerns that the detailed logs had exposed the names of Afghan informants, thus endangering their lives. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/aug/01/afghan-war-wikileaks-press-comment|title=WikiLeaks' Afghan story raises dilemma over safety of sources - The WikiLeaks log showed the failures of the Afghan war – but the media moved on, overwhelmed by the weight of material|last=Preston|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Preston|date=1 August 2010|publisher=[[guardian.co.uk]]|accessdate=24 August 2010 | location=London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100804210852/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/aug/01/afghan-war-wikileaks-press-comment| archivedate= 4 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/aug/09/afghanistan-war-logs-readers-editor | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Chris | last=Elliott | title=Open door | date=9 August 2010}}</ref> Partially in response to this criticism, Wikileaks announced that it has sought the help of the Pentagon in reviewing a further 15,000 documents before releasing them.

On 11 August, a spokesman for the Pentagon told the [[Washington Post]] that "We have yet to see any harm come to anyone in Afghanistan that we can directly tie to exposure in the WikiLeaks documents",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/checkpoint-washington/2010/08/pentagon_undisclosed_wikileak.html |title= Pentagon: Undisclosed Wikileaks documents 'potentially more explosive' |publisher= [[The Washington Post]] | accessdate=24 October 2010}}</ref> although the spokesman asserted "there is in all likelihood a lag between exposure of these documents and jeopardy in the field." On 17 August, the [[Associated Press]] reported that "so far there is no evidence that any Afghans named in the leaked documents as defectors or informants from the Taliban insurgency have been harmed in retaliation."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mobile.salon.com/news/feature/2010/08/17/wikileaks_risks_overstated/index.html |title= Are risks from WikiLeaks overstated by government? |publisher=[[CNN]] | accessdate=24 October 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101020112212/http://mobile.salon.com/news/feature/2010/08/17/wikileaks_risks_overstated/index.html| archivedate= 20 October 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> .

===Insurgent attacks against civilians===. 
The leaked documents describe many purported incidents of Taliban and other Afghan insurgent forces attacking civilians. Those forces would also, according to leaked reports, post 'Night Letters' on civilian buildings such as [[mosques]] foretelling death for the inhabitants. In one leak from April 2007, then-[[Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs]] [[Karen Hughes]] requests to verify a video of a 12-year-old [[child soldier]] forced to [[summary execution|kill]] a Pakistani hostage. Thomas Joscelyn, a senior fellow at the [[think tank]] [[Foundation for Defense of Democracies]], remarked that "the documents demonstrate just how pervasive the Taliban’s brutality is in this fight". <ref>{{citenews|title=The Taliban's Savagery|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/talibans-savagery|date=3 August 2010|first=Thomas|last=Joscelyn|publisher=''[[The Weekly Standard]]''}}</ref> . 

===Child prostitution===. 
The documents revealed that United States Department of Defense private contractor employees hired local male child prostitutes. <ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/08/wikileaks-reveals-that-mi_n_793816.html "WikiLeaks Reveals That Military Contractors Have Not Lost Their Taste For Child Prostitutes"], Jason Linkins.

==Commentary==. 
===Significance of the disclosure===. 
====Wikileaks====. 
Wikileaks editor Julian Assange said "it is the most comprehensive history of a war ever to be published, during the course of the war". <ref name=tells-all /> He compared the release of the war logs with the release of the [[Pentagon Papers]] in the 1970s. <ref name=tells-all>{{cite news | title=Afghan leak: Wikileaks Julian Assange tells all | newspaper=[[Channel 4]] | date={{Nowrap|25 July}} 2010 | url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/politics/international_politics/afghan+leak+wikileaks+julian+assange+tells+all/3723392 | accessdate={{Nowrap|27 July}} 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first1=Anna | last1=Doble | first2=Ed | last2=Fraser | title=Secret files reveal 'unseen Afghan war' | newspaper=[[Channel 4]] | date={{Nowrap|26 July}} 2010 | url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/politics/international_politics/secret+files+wikileaks+exposes+aposunseen+afghan+warapos/3723387 | accessdate={{Nowrap|26 July}} 2010}}</ref>  In an interview with ''Der Spiegel'', Assange said that he believed the release would "change public opinion", and said that "we understand why it is important to protect certain U.S. and ISAF sources."  He added that "the most dangerous men are those who are in charge of war. And they need to be stopped."<ref>{{cite news | title=WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange on the 'War Logs': 'I Enjoy Crushing Bastards' | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,708518,00.html | newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]] | date=26 July 2010 | accessdate=28 July 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100727234634/http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,708518,00.html| archivedate= 27 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Assange also claimed that the files "suggest thousands of [[war crime]]s."<ref>{{cite news | title=Files 'suggest thousands of war crimes,' says Wikileaks founder Julian Assange | url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/files-suggest-thousands-of-war-crimes-says-wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-14889654.html | newspaper=[[The Belfast Telegraph]] | date=27 July 2010 | accessdate=28 July 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100728010037/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/files-suggest-thousands-of-war-crimes-says-wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-14889654.html| archivedate= 28 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
====News organisations given advanced access to the documents====. 
=====''The New York Times''=====. 
''The New York Times'' described the war logs as "a six-year archive of classified military documents [that] offers an unvarnished and grim picture of the Afghan war".  . 

On the decision to publish, they stated:
 {{blockquote|"Deciding whether to publish secret information is always difficult, and after weighing the risks and public interest, we sometimes chose not to publish. But there are times when the information is of significant public interest, and this is one of those times. The documents illuminate the extraordinary difficulty of what the United States and its allies have undertaken in a way that other accounts have not.  . 

Most of the incident reports are marked "secret", a relatively low level of classification. The Times has taken care not to publish information that would harm national security interests. The Times and the other news organizations agreed at the outset that we would not disclose—either in our articles or any of our online supplementary material—anything that was likely to put lives at risk or jeopardize military or antiterrorist operations. We have, for example, withheld any names of operatives in the field and informants cited in the reports". <ref name=NYTeditorsnote/>}} . 

=====''The Guardian''=====. 
''The Guardian'' called the material "one of the biggest leaks in U.S. military history&nbsp;... a devastating portrait of the failing [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]], revealing how coalition forces have killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents, Taliban attacks have soared and [[NATO]] commanders fear neighbouring Pakistan and Iran are fuelling the insurgency". <ref name=GuardianLeaks/> . 

''The Guardian'' also reported that [[Daniel Ellsberg]] has described the disclosure as on the scale of his leaking of the [[Pentagon Papers]] in 1971 revealing how the U.S. public was misled about the [[Vietnam War]]. <ref name=GuardianEllsberg>{{cite news | first=Richard | last=Norton-Taylor | title=Daniel Ellsberg describes Afghan war logs as on a par with 'Pentagon Papers' | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date={{Nowrap|27 July}} 2010 | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/27/daniel-ellsberg-war-logs-pentagon-papers | accessdate={{Nowrap|27 July}} 2010 | location=London}}</ref> .

====Other views====. 
=====United States military=====. 
<!-- There is also a Pentagon view here, but I'm not sure where to place it. -->
US Army officials condemned the public dissimination of military secrets and the White House urged the website WikiLeaks to not publish any more classified documents related to the Afghan war. <ref>[http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/Mullen-Leak-of-Afghanistan-Documents-May-Cost-Lives-99720029.html "US Military Officials Condemn Leaks of Afghan War Documents"]</ref><ref>[http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/US-Army-Private-in-Wikileaks-Case-Transferred-to-Military-Jail-in-US-99625149.html "White House Urges WikiLeaks to Not Publish More Secrets"]</ref> U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said that it is up to the Justice Department to determine if there would be criminal charges in the release of classified military documents by WikiLeaks, but the website was ''"morally guilty for putting lives at risk"''. <ref>{{cite news | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/08/01/gates.wikileaks/?hpt=T2#fbid=Uplw7ezfGkE | work=CNN | title=Gates: Posting classified war documents was morally wrong | date=1 August 2010}}</ref> . 

On 6 August 2010, U.S. military authorities urged Wikileaks to return the already published 70,000 documents, and the other 15,000 records the website was expected to post soon as well, which contained sensitive details of Afghans who had assisted ISAF forces.

=====Afghan authorities=====. 
According to a statement by [[Rangin Dadfar Spanta]], security advisor of the Afghan government and former Minister of Foreign Affairs, the allies of Afghanistan had failed to pay necessary attention to prevent the support for international terrorism and to eliminate its hideouts and centres that can create a major threat to security and stability in the region. "The content of these documents reveal that Afghanistan has been righteous in its stance about the rise of terrorism and political and military discrepancies in counter-terrorism struggle". <ref>[http://www.tolonews.com/en/afghanistan/155-afghan-allies-have-not-paid-attention-to-the-region-spanta "Afghan Allies Have not Paid Attention to the Region: Spanta"]</ref> . 

=====Council on Foreign Relations=====. 
Daniel Markey, a senior fellow with the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] and former [[South Asia]] analyst for the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]], said, "Whether WikiLeaks uncovered anything new isn't actually important&nbsp;– it's on the front page of every newspaper in the country; the media is now focused on Afghanistan, and that makes it a big deal.

=====''Los Angeles Times''=====. 
An editorial in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stated that comparisons to the Pentagon Papers was an exaggeration as the documents lacked the policy implications of the papers, but that "no democracy can or should fight a war without the consent of its people, and that consent is only meaningful if it is predicated on real information". <ref name="WikiLeaks wasn't wrong">{{cite news | title=WikiLeaks wasn't wrong | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-wikileaks-20100727,0,4123134.story | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=26 July 2010 | accessdate=28 July 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100728001408/http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-wikileaks-20100727,0,4123134.story| archivedate= 28 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The LA Times did seem to indicate the documents have parallels with the Pentagon Papers in being published during a subsequent administration "the documents offer insight primarily into the war-fighting of the recently departed George W.

=="Insurance file"==. 
On 30 July, a few days after the initial disclosure, media began to report that Wikileaks had released an additional file named "insurance.aes256"  in connection with the Afghan War Diary disclosure. The new "insurance file" was [[AES-256]] encrypted, 1.4 GB in size, with a [[timestamp]] of 31 December 2010 6:00 PM, and with a [[SHA1]] checksum of "cce54d3a8af370213d23fcbfe8cddc8619a0734c". <ref name="Wikileaks"/> It is also available at the [[Internet Archive]]. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archive.org/details/WikileaksWarDiaryInsurance |title=Wikileaks War Diary Insurance |date=1 August 2010 |publisher=[[Internet Archive]] |accessdate=7 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archive.org/details/WikiLeaks_Insurance_File |title=WikiLeaks Insurance File |date=8 December 2010 |publisher=[[Internet Archive]] |accessdate=7 March 2012}}</ref> . 

At 1.4 gigabytes, that file was 20 times larger than the batch of 77,000 secret U.S. military documents about Afghanistan that WikiLeaks already published, and cryptographers said that the file was virtually impossible to crack, unless WikiLeaks releases the key used to encode the material. <ref name="Wikileaks"/><ref>[http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/07/wikileaks-insurance-file/ "WikiLeaks Posts Mysterious ‘Insurance’ File"]</ref><ref>[http://cryptome.org/0002/wl-diary-mirror.htm "Cryptome"]</ref><ref>[http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread598787/pg20 "WikiLeaks Posts Mysterious 'Insurance' File"]</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/08/05/ap/tech/main6746666.shtml | work=CBS News}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> .
