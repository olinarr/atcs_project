==Background==. 
{{main|Late-2000s recession|Job losses caused by the late-2000s recession|United States debt-ceiling crisis}}
Since the start of the [[great recession]], [[unemployment]] and [[underemployment]] levels in the U.S. have remained stubbornly high.  Through the resulting "[[jobless recovery]]," [[consumer confidence]] has remained shaky, raising the specter of a [[double dip recession]].  . 

In August 2011, the U.S. Congress agreed on raising the debt ceiling and a reduction in deficits within the next decade.  The acrimonious debate leading to the passage of this bill made clear that some in the [[United States Congress]] considered national default to be a viable political option.  Following passage, [[Standard & Poor's]] downgraded the United States top [[Credit rating#Sovereign credit ratings|credit rating]] from AAA to AA+ citing various factors including the long term political struggle to raise the debt ceiling and a lack of credible plans to reduce federal spending and increase tax revenue. <ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-06/u-s-credit-rating-cut-by-s-p-for-first-time-on-deficit-reduction-accord.html | title=U.S. Loses AAA Credit Rating as S&P Slams Debt Levels, Political Process | first=John | last=Detrixhe | publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] | date=August 8, 2011 | accessdate=September 11, 2011}}</ref>  Economic data released in July and August 2011 came in worse than expected, and worldwide stock markets tumbled quickly raising the fear of a new recession. <ref name="olympian">{{cite news | url=http://www.theolympian.com/2011/08/22/1768458/fear-feeds-faltering-stock-market.html | title=Fear feeds Faltering Stock market | date=August 22, 2011 | accessdate=September 9, 2011 | publisher=[[The Olympian]] | work=[[The Associated Press]] | last=Condon | first=Bernard | last2=Rugaber | first2=Christopher}}</ref>  After [[Labor Day]], President Obama, in a major speech<ref name="guardian"/> before a [[Joint session of the United States Congress|joint session of Congress]],<ref name="wh"/> detailed a major new jobs package and urged the Congress to pass it without delay.  .

{{Wikisource|Barack Obama speech to joint session of Congress, September 2011}} . 

Obama's speech aired in the United States on 11 television networks during primetime, including [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[NBC]], [[CNN]], [[Fox News Channel]], [[Fox Business Network]], [[MSNBC]], and [[CNBC]]. [[Nielsen Media Research]] estimate that 31.4 million viewers watched the speech, 10 million less than the [[2011 State of the Union Address]], but six million more than his March speech on [[2011 Libyan civil war|Libya]]. <ref>{{cite news| title=Obama's jobs speech draws 31.4M viewers |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2011/09/obamas-jobs-speech-draws-314m-viewers/1 |date=September 10, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2011 |first=David |last=Jackson |work=[[USA Today]]}}</ref>  The President's address was rescheduled to September 8 after his original request to deliver the speech on September 7 was rebuffed by Speaker of the House [[John Boehner]], who cited a clash with a Republican Presidential debate already scheduled for the same time and stated that more time was required to secure the House for the President's visit. <ref name="tpm">{{cite news | url=http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/09/speechgate-how-obamas-jobs-address-got-postponed.php | title=Speechgate: How Obama’s Jobs Address Got Postponed | date=September 1, 2011 | accessdate=September 9, 2011 | publisher=[[Talking Points Memo]] | last=Bobic | first=Igor}}</ref> The President made his speech at 7:00pm Eastern, instead of the usual 9:00pm start for presidential addresses to joint sessions of Congress, so he would be finished before the first game of the [[2011 NFL season|National Football League season]] between the [[New Orleans Saints]] and the [[Green Bay Packers]] at 8:30pm. <ref>Alison Gendar and Thomas M.

The Republicans declined to broadcast an official opposition response, as it is traditionally done after a presidential address to a joint session of Congress. This decision was criticized by House Minority Leader [[Nancy Pelosi]] as being "disrespectful" to the president and the American people. <ref>[http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2011/09/no-formal-gop-response-to-obama-speech/1 No (formal) GOP response to Obama speech].

In total the legislation includes $253 billion in tax credits (56.6%) and $194 billion in spending and extension of unemployment benefits (43.4%). <ref name="WhiteHouseFactSheet"/> . 

==Legislative history==. 
In the Senate, the bill was stalled by [[Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate|Majority leader]] [[Harry Reid]] on September 27, 2011 who said "I don’t think there’s anything more important for a jobs measure than China trade, and that’s what we’re going to work on next week," with emphasis on taking up more tenuous legislation which is less likely to draw political attention. <ref name="n">{{cite news|last=Helderman|first=Rosalind|title=Obama jobs plan: Senate Democrats won’t take up bill immediately, Harry Reid says|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-jobs-plan-senate-democrats-wont-take-up-bill-immediately-harry-reid-says/2011/09/27/gIQAWman2K_story.html | publisher=[[The Washington Post]] | accessdate=September 28, 2011|date=September 28, 2011}}</ref> On October 4, 2011, [[Party Leaders of the United States Senate|Minority Leader]] [[Mitch McConnell]] attempted to offer the Act as an amendment to the China trade bill, saying that while he disagreed with the bill's approach to job creation, it deserved to be voted on. <ref>http://www.c-span.org/Events/Senators-Reid-amp-McConnell-Remarks-on-President39s-Jobs-Plan/10737424582/</ref> On October 5, Reid announced a plan to pay for the American Jobs Act with a 5% surtax on incomes of more than $1 million a year. <ref>{{cite news | first=Robert | last=Pear | title=A Revenue Bill and a Gauntlet for the G.O.P | newspaper=New York Times | date=October 5, 2011 | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/06/us/politics/democratic-leaders-propose-millionaires-tax-to-pay-for-jobs-plan.html | accessdate=October 11, 2011}}</ref> . 

In the House of Representatives, as a matter of procedure; on September 12, 2011 The Speaker pro tempore laid before the House a message from the President transmitting the legislative proposal, referred to committee and ordered it to be printed (H.

On October 11, the bill was voted on in the Senate where it failed to garner the necessary sixty votes to proceed.

==Reception==. 
===Republicans and conservatives===. 
Republicans and conservative radio hosts were quick to label the American Jobs Act as "son of stimulus" after the controversial [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]. Martin Feldstein, a Harvard economist and Obama appointee to the [[President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board|Economic Recovery Advisory Board]], put the price tag on the American Jobs Act at about $200,000 per job, which Republicans argue as the true cost for the proposed legislation. <ref>{{cite web | last=Forer | first=Ben | title=$200K Per Job?

With Obama stating a willingness to consider a piecemeal approach on the legislation, Cantor said "At this point I think that Washington has become so dysfunctional that we've got to start focusing on the incremental progress we can make.

Many Democrats have balked at the bill, siding with the Republicans, especially those facing difficult re-elections in congressional districts where they are hesitant to support unpopular legislation. <ref>{{cite news|last=STEINHAUER|first=Jennifer|title=Some Democrats Are Balking at Obama’s Jobs Bill|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/15/us/politics/democrats-in-congress-balking-at-obamas-jobs-bill.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=September 27, 2011|date=September 14, 2011}}</ref> A majority of the Democrats support individual components of the bill, but are unwilling to commit to the bill in its entirety, despite the White House's disapproval of the weak showing of support. Some Democrats from core Democratic districts oppose the American Jobs Act because it gives more tax breaks, thus contributing more to the federal deficit, which has given Obama more responsibility to sell the plan first to the American public, as he has done on a very prominent, nationwide speaking tour. <ref>{{cite news|last=Cooper|first=Helene|title=White House Would Cut Deductions to Pay for Its Jobs Plan|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/12/obama-pleads-for-congress-to-approve-jobs-bill|work=New York Times|accessdate=September 30, 2011|date=September 12, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Karen|title=Obama pushes education spending in Denver visit|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-09-27/politics/politics_obama-west-coast_1_president-barack-obama-gallup-orc-international-poll?_s=PM:POLITICS | publisher=[[CNN]]| accessdate=October 1, 2011|date=September 25, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Geraghty |first=Jim |title=Obama’s ‘Jobs Act’ Tour Strangely Avoids Wavering Democrats | url=http://www.nationalreview.com/campaign-spot/277586/obamas-jobs-act-tour-strangely-avoids-wavering-democrats | publisher=[[The National Review]] | accessdate=October 1, 2011}}</ref> . 

Both moderate and progressive Democrats have expressed concerns about the bill. Joe Manchin, a more moderate-leaning Democrat, has openly voiced his opposition with the administration by arguing against the inclusion of too much spending, given by his remarks on September 29, "The ugly part of that act is $450 billion of spending, after we've spent, spent, spent." On the other side, progressive Democrat Peter DeFazio, a more progressive-leaning Democrat from Oregon, argued against the inclusion of nearly $250 billion of tax breaks, saying "Half of it is tax cuts, and quite frankly tax cuts don't work."<ref>{{cite news| last=Condon | first=Stephanie | title=Dick Durbin: We don't have the votes to pass Obama's jobs bill yet | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20113817-503544.html | publisher=CBS News | accessdate=September 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last=Johnson |first=Whit | title=Even Democrats skeptical of Obama's jobs act | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/09/17/eveningnews/main20107801.shtml | publisher=CBS News | accessdate=October 3, 2011}}</ref> .
