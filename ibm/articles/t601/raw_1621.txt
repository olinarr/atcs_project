The '''Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act''' or '''JOBS Act''', is a pending law intended to encourage [[funding]] of United States [[small businesses]] by easing various [[Securities regulation in the United States|securities regulations]].  It passed with [[bipartisan]] support, and as of late March, 2012, is awaiting signature by the [[President of the United States]].

==Provisions of bill==. 
The legislation would, among many other things, extend the amount of time that certain new [[public company|public companies]] have to begin compliance with certain requirements, including certain requirements that originated with the [[Sarbanesâ€“Oxley Act]], from two years to five years. <ref name="Feldman">{{cite web|last=Feldman|first=David|title=Summary of JOBS Bill and Update |url=http://www.reversemergerblog.com/2012/03/17/summary-of-jobs-bill-and-update/|accessdate=March 19, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=H.R. 3606, 112th Cong., ti. 1|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr3606rh/pdf/BILLS-112hr3606rh.pdf|accessdate=March 19, 2012}}</ref>  . 

The primary provisions of the House bill as amended would:
*increase the number of [[shareholder]]s a company may have before being required to register its common stock with the SEC and become a publicly reporting company.  Currently, these requirements are generally triggered when a company's assets reach $10 million and it has 500 shareholders of record. <ref>{{cite web|title=Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934|url=http://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=SEC Rule 12g-1, 17 CFR 240.12g-1|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=1962f541b83dfc4e5b04d540c4acc616&rgn=div8&view=text&node=17:3.0.1.1.1.2.74.145&idno=17}}</ref> The House bill would alter this so that the threshold is reached only if the company has 500 "unaccredited" shareholders, or 2,000 total shareholders, including both accredited and unaccredited shareholders. <ref name="Feldman"/><ref>{{cite web|title=H.R. 3606, 112th Cong., sec. 501|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr3606rh/pdf/BILLS-112hr3606rh.pdf|accessdate=March 19, 2012}}</ref>  However, under current interpretations, when shares are held in "street name" (i.e., registered in the name of the broker), only the broker counts as the shareholder of record.  Since a given broker may hold shares on behalf of many individuals and yet still count as only one shareholder, it is already possible and common for a company to have thousands of shareholders in reality but still not be required to register with the SEC. <ref>{{cite web|last=Hamilton|first=Jim|title=House Panel Advances Bills Raising 500-Shareholder Threshold for Public Companies and Community Banks (Oct. 11, 2011)|url=http://jimhamiltonblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/house-panel-advances-bills-raising-500.html|accessdate=23 March 2012}}</ref> 
*To provide a new exemption from the requirement to register public offerings with the SEC, for certain types of small offerings, subject to several conditions.  This exemption would allow use of the internet "funding portals" registered with the government, the use of which in private placements is currently extremely limited by current law.  One of the conditions of this exemption is a yearly aggregate limit on the amount each person may invest in offerings of this type, tiered by the person's net worth or yearly income.  The limit ranges from 2% of people earning (or worth) up to $40,000, up to a cap of $10,000 for people earning (or worth) $100,000 or more.  This exemption is intended to allow a form of [[crowd funding]]). <ref name="csm">{{cite news|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|title=What does the JOBS Act actually do?|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2012/0308/What-does-the-JOBS-Act-actually-do-Six-questions-answered/What-s-in-the-JOBS-Act|first=David|last=Grant}}</ref> While there are already many types of exemptions, most exempt offerings, especially those conducted using the internet, currently are offered only to accredited investors, or limit the number of non-accredited investors who are allowed to participate, due to the legal restrictions place on private placements of securities. 
*To relieve certain kinds of companies, which the bill calls "emerging growth companies," from certain regulatory and disclosure requirements in the registration statement they originally file when they go public, and for a period of five years after that.  The most significant relief provided is from obligations imposed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules and regulations.  Currently, new public companies have a two year phase-in, so this bill would extend that by an additional three years.  Also, smaller public companies are also already entitled to special relief from these requirements, and the bill does not change that. <ref name="csm"/>
*To lift the current ban on "general solication" and advertising in specific kinds of private placements of securities. <ref name="csm"/>
*To raise the limit for securities offerings exempted under [[Regulation D (SEC)|Rule 505 of Regulation D]] from $5 million to $50 million, thereby allowing for larger fundraising efforts under this simplified regulation. <ref name="csm"/>
*To raise the number of permitted shareholders in [[community bank]]s from 500 to 2,000. <ref name="csm"/> . 

==Reception==. 
The JOBS Act had bipartisan support in Congress. <ref name="Bridge">{{cite news|title=Small Biz Jobs Act Is a Bipartisan Bridge Too Far|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-18/small-biz-jobs-act-is-a-bipartisan-bridge-too-far-view.html|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=March 18, 2012}}</ref><ref name="cnn">{{cite news|title=House to pass bipartisan bill aimed at start-ups|first=Jennifer|last=Liberto|date=March 8, 2012|publisher=CNN|url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/08/smallbusiness/House-startup-bill/index.htm?hpt=hp_t1}}</ref>  It was supported by many in the technology and startup communities, including Google,<ref>[http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2012/03/bipartisanship-new-businesses-and-new.html Bipartisanship, new businesses and new jobs, with a little help from your friends] Thursday, March 15, 2012</ref> Steve Case (founder of AOL), Mitch Kapor (founder of Lotus), Jim Newton (founder of [[TechShop]]), and many other investors and entrepreneurs. It is also supported by the [[National Venture Capital Association]], which described the bill as modernizing regulations that were put in place almost 100 years before, by among other things facilitating use of online services to make investments in small companies.  . 

The bill was opposed by some securities regulators and consumer and investor advocates, including the [[AARP]], the [[Consumer Federation of America]], the [[Council of Institutional Investors]], and others. <ref name="CFA">[http://www.consumerfed.org/news/473 "Organizations and Individuals Critical of Anti-investor Provisions in the House JOBS Act and Companion Senate Bills"], Consumer Federation of America. </ref>  Among the complaints were that the loosening of investment protections would expose small and inexperienced investors to fraud.  The Consumer Federation of America characterized an earlier version of the legislation as "the dangerous and discredited notion that the way to create jobs is to weaken regulatory protections". <ref>[http://www.consumerfed.org/news/467 "Public Interest Groups Oppose Anti-Investor 'Capital Formation' Bills"], Consumer Federation of America open letter to Sen. Johnson and Rep.

Some{{who|date=April 2012}} criticized the House version of the bill as "gutting regulations designed to safeguard investors",<ref>Kathleen Pender, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2012/03/11/BUPU1NIGVF.DTL "Financial regulations gutted in new bill"], ''San Francisco Chronicle''</ref> legalizing [[boiler room (business)|boiler room operations]],<ref>Statement of Professor John C.
