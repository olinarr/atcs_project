{{U.S. Deficit and Debt Topics}} . 

'''Deficit reduction in the United States''' refers to taxation, spending, and economic policy debates and proposals designed to reduce the Federal budget deficit and move the United States to a sustainable fiscal path. Government agencies including the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO), [[Congressional Budget Office]], the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) and the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] have reported that the federal government is facing a series of important financing challenges. In the short-run, tax revenues have declined significantly due to a severe [[recession]] and tax policy choices, while expenditures have expanded for wars, unemployment insurance and other safety net spending. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/09/opinion/09krugman.html?src=ISMR_AP_LO_MST_FB NYT-Krugman-The Unwisdom of Elites-May 2011]</ref><ref name="pewtrusts.org">[http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Fact_Sheets/Economic_Policy/drivers_federal_debt_since_2001.pdf Pew Charitable Trusts-The Great Debt Shift-April 2011]</ref> In the long-run, expenditures related to healthcare programs such as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] are projected to grow faster than the economy overall as the population matures. <ref>[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10840 Charlie Rose Show-Senators Bayh, Gregg and Roger Altman-February 1, 2010]</ref><ref>[http://www.cbpp.org/files/01-12-10bud.pdf Center on Budget and Policy Priorities-The Right Target: Stabilize the Federal Debt January 2010]</ref> . 

==Deficit history and trends==. 
[[File:CBO - Revenues and Outlays as percent GDP.png|thumb|300px|2010 Budget: Projected Deficits and Debt Increases|right]]
A budget deficit refers to expenditures that exceed tax collections during a given period, requiring borrowing to fund the difference.  The U.S. federal government has run annual deficits in 36 of the past 40 fiscal years, with surpluses from 1998-2001. Tax revenues averaged approximately 18% [[GDP]] from 1971–2010, with expenditures around 21% GDP, resulting in an average annual deficit of around 3% GDP. For example, in 2010 revenues were $2.16 trillion and outlays were $3.46 trillion, resulting in a deficit of $1.3 trillion or 9.4% GDP. <ref name="CBO Historical Tables-1971 to 2010">[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12039/HistoricalTables&#91;1&#93;.pdf CBO Historical Tables-1971 to 2010]</ref> . 

Debt represents the accumulation of deficits over time. Debt held by the public, a partial measure of the U.S. national debt, rose in dollar terms each year except during the 1998-2001 surplus period. Measured as a percentage of GDP, debt held by the public ranged between 23% and 50% during the 1971-2007 period, then rose significantly in the wake of the financial crisis and recession of 2008–present, ending 2010 at 62.1% GDP or $9.0 trillion. <ref name="CBO Historical Tables-1971 to 2010"/> . 

==Causes of recent deficits and debt increases==. 
{{Main|Political debates about the United States federal budget}} . 

Economic growth and employment are key factors driving recent deficits. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimated in October 2011 that approximately one-third of the deficit projected for fiscal year 2012 is due to economic factors, which have caused safety net expenditures to increase and tax revenues to decline with high unemployment. <ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/124xx/doc12440/10-04-Portion_of_Deficit_Due_to_Cyclical_Weakness.pdf CBO Letter to Congressman Van Hollen-October 4, 2011]</ref> . 

The U.S. last balanced its budget in 2001. Between 2001 and 2010, spending increased by 5.6% GDP (from 18.2% GDP in 2001 to 23.8% GDP in 2010), while revenues declined by 4.6% GDP (from 19.5% GDP in 2001 to 14.9% GDP in 2010), resulting in a 9.4% GDP deficit. Medicare/Medicaid spending increased by 1.9% GDP and defense spending increased by 1.7% GDP. Individual income tax revenues fell by 3.5% GDP and payroll taxes fell by 0.8% GDP. <ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12039/HistoricalTables%5B1%5D.pdf CBO Historical Tables-1971 to 2010]</ref><ref>[http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/Fiscal_Analysis/Essential_Federal_Fiscal_Charts.pdf Pew Trusts-10 Key Budget Charts-2011]</ref> . 

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] summarized these causes in May 2011: "What happened to the budget surplus the federal government had in 2000? The answer is, three main things. First, there were the Bush tax cuts, which added roughly $2 trillion to the national debt over the last decade. Second, there were the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which added an additional $1.1 trillion or so. And third was the Great Recession, which led both to a collapse in revenue and to a sharp rise in spending on unemployment insurance and other safety-net programs."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/09/opinion/09krugman.html?src=ISMR_AP_LO_MST_FB NYT-Paul Krugman-The Unwisdom of Elites-May 2011]</ref> . 

==Risks and obstacles of high debt levels==. 
===Risks to the U.S. dollar and economy=== . 

A high debt level may affect inflation, interest rates, and economic growth. A variety of factors are placing increasing pressure on the value of the U.S. dollar, increasing the risk of devaluation or inflation and encouraging challenges to dollar's role as the world's [[reserve currency]]. If another currency or basket of currencies replaced the dollar as the reserve currency, the U.S. would face higher interest rates to attract capital, reducing economic growth for the long-term. ''[[The Economist]]'' wrote in May 2009: . 

{{quote|Having spent a fortune bailing out their banks, Western governments will have to pay a price in terms of higher taxes to meet the interest on that debt. In the case of countries (like Britain and America) that have trade as well as budget deficits, those higher taxes will be needed to meet the claims of foreign creditors. Given the political implications of such austerity, the temptation will be to default by stealth, by letting their currencies depreciate. Investors are increasingly alive to this danger... <ref>Buttonwood (May 14, 2009).

The U.S. also has a large [[trade deficit]], meaning imports exceed exports. Such deficits are only possible if there is a large foreign investment, or a capital account surplus. The [[balance of payments#Standard definition|balance of payments]] [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]] requires that a country (such as the USA) running a [[current account]] deficit also have a [[capital account]] (investment) surplus of the same amount. In 2005, [[Ben Bernanke]] addressed the implications of the USA's high and rising [[current account]] (trade) deficit, resulting from USA imports exceeding its exports. Between 1996 and 2004, the USA current account deficit increased by $650&nbsp;billion, from 1.5% to 5.8% of GDP. <ref>{{cite web|author=Bernanke, Ben S.|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050414/default.htm |title=The global saving glut and U.S. current account deficit |work=Federalreserve.gov |date=April 14, 2005 |accessdate=February 2, 2011}}</ref> . 

Debt levels may also affect economic growth rates. Economists [[Kenneth Rogoff]] and [[Carmen Reinhart]] reported in 2010 that among the 20 advanced countries studied, average annual GDP growth was 3–4% when debt was relatively moderate or low (i.e. under 60% of GDP), but it dips to just 1.6% when debt was high (i.e., above 90% of GDP). <ref name="house.gov">U.S. House of Representatives Republican Caucus (May 27, 2010).

The CBO reported several types of risk factors related to rising debt levels in a July 2010 publication:
*A growing portion of savings would go towards purchases of government debt, rather than investments in productive capital goods such as factories and computers, leading to lower output and incomes than would otherwise occur;
*If higher marginal tax rates were used to pay rising interest costs, savings would be reduced and work would be discouraged;
*Rising interest costs would force reductions in important government programs;
*Restrictions to the ability of policymakers to use fiscal policy to respond to economic challenges; and
*An increased risk of a sudden fiscal crisis, in which investors demand higher interest rates. <ref>Huntley, Jonathan (July 27, 2010).

===Rollover and maturity risks===. 
In addition to the debt increase required to fund government spending in excess of tax revenues during a given year, some Treasury securities issued in prior years mature and must be "rolled-over" or replaced with new security issuance. During the financial crisis, the Treasury issued a sizable amount of relatively shorter-term debt, which caused the average maturity on total Treasury debt to reach a 25-year low of just more than 50 months in 2009. As of late 2009, roughly 43% of U.S. public debt needed to be rolled over within 12 months, the highest proportion since the mid-1980s. The relatively short maturity of outstanding Treasury debt, coupled with the increased reliance on foreign creditors, puts the U.S. at greater risk of sharply higher borrowing costs should risk perceptions change abruptly in credit markets. <ref name="house.gov"/> . 

===Long-term risks to financial health of federal government===.

[[Image:GAO Slide.png|thumb|right|350px|Risks due to increasing entitlement spending, according to GAO's projections of future trends]] . 

Several government agencies provide budget and debt data and analysis. These include the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO), the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO), the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB), and the [[U.S. Treasury Department]]. These agencies have reported that the federal government is facing a series of critical long-term financing challenges. This is because expenditures related to entitlement programs such as [[Social Security debate (United States)|Social Security]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], and [[Medicaid]] are growing considerably faster than the economy overall, as the population grows older.  . 

These agencies have indicated that under current law, sometime between 2030 and 2040, mandatory spending (primarily Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and interest on the national debt) will exceed tax revenue. In other words, all "discretionary" spending (e.g., defense, homeland security, law enforcement, education, etc.) will require borrowing and related deficit spending. These agencies have used such language as "unsustainable" and "trainwreck" to describe such a future. <ref name="GAOCitiz"/> .

===Monitoring the risks of increasing debt levels===. 
Various financial indicators may provide an early warning that market forces are reacting to an increasing level of debt. Examples include Treasury security interest rates (yields), Treasury auction results, credit default swap spreads, and TIPS spreads. 
*Treasury note yields: A rising yield for a security of a given maturity could indicate lower demand for Treasury bonds among investors, or nervousness about future rates of inflation. The [[yield curve]], a graph that relates the yields of similar securities of different maturities, provides similar information. 
*Treasury auctions: The ease with which new securities can be sold reflects the demand for them. For example, a difference between the interest rate that debt trades prior to auction and the yield required to clear the market at auction is called the "tail." A large auction “tail” would be a sign of declining interest from the market. The Treasury also reports the bid-to-cover ratio for each auction, which is the number of market bids received relative to the number of bids accepted and the ratio of international buyers. 
*[[Credit default swap]] (CDS) spreads: CDS are insurance-like derivative products that offer protection against bond defaults. CDS spreads essentially measure the current market price of insurance against default. When the market perceives a bond is at an increased risk of default, the CDS written on those bonds will increase in price. 
*TIPS spreads: A key measure of inflation expectations among U.S. bond market investors is the difference between the yield on nominal Treasury bonds and the yield for Treasury inflation-protected securities, or “TIPS.” This difference is a gauge of investors’ beliefs about future U.S. inflation rates. A growing spread between nominal Treasuries and TIPS would indicate that investors are concerned that U.S. fiscal and monetary policy could lead to higher inflation in the future. <ref name="house.gov"/> . 

In April 2011, rating agency Standard & Poor's (S&P) issued a "negative" outlook on the U.S. "AAA" (highest quality) debt rating for the first time since the rating agency began in 1860, indicating there is a one in three chance of an outright reduction in the rating over the next two years. According to S&P, meaningful progress towards balancing the budget would be required to move the U.S. back to a "stable" outlook. Losing the AAA rating would likely mean higher interest rates and the sale of treasury bonds by entities required to hold AAA securities. <ref name="eye_on_the_economy">{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42643641/ns/business-eye_on_the_economy/ |title=S&P Issues Negative Outlook-April&nbsp;19, 2011 |publisher=MSNBC |date=April 19, 2011 |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref> The S&P press release stated: "We believe there is a material risk that U.S. policymakers might not reach an agreement on how to address medium- and long-term budgetary challenges by 2013; if an agreement is not reached and meaningful implementation is not begun by then, this would in our view render the U.S. fiscal profile meaningfully weaker than that of peer 'AAA' sovereigns."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.standardandpoors.com/ratings/articles/en/us/?assetID=1245302886884 |title=S&P Press Release-April&nbsp;18, 2011 |publisher=Standardandpoors.com |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref> In June, [[Moody's]] followed suit, warning that if Congress did not quickly raise the [[debt ceiling]] above $14.3&nbsp;trillion, the agency might reduce the debt rating.

==General strategies==. 
Strategies for addressing the deficit problem may include policy choices regarding taxation and spending, along with policies designed to increase economic growth and reduce unemployment. These policy decisions may be evaluated in the context of a framework:<ref name="Bittle 2011">{{cite book
| last = Bittle
| first = Scott
| year = 2011
| title = Where Does the Money Go? | publisher = Harper
| isbn = 978-0-06-124187-1}}</ref> . 

*Promote economic growth and employment: A fast-growing economy offers the [[Win-win game|win-win]] outcome of a larger proverbial economic pie to divide, with higher employment and tax revenues, lower safety net spending and a lower debt-to-GDP ratio. 
*Make equitable trade-offs: Many budget choices have [[Zero sum game|win-lose]] outcomes, reflecting how government revenues are divided, with some benefiting and others incurring costs. For example, taking away benefits from those in or near retirement may be considered inequitable, while phasing out retirement benefits for younger workers may be considered less so. 
*Keep short- and long-term issues in perspective: Healthcare cost inflation and an aging population are the primary long-term deficit drivers. Unemployment and various tax and spending policy choices are the primary short-term deficit drivers. Measures to encourage economic growth today can be implemented along with other measures to reduce future deficits. <ref>[http://www.brookings.edu/testimony/2009/0127_budget_rivlin.aspx Alice M. Rivlin Congressional Testimony-January 2009]</ref>
*Limit or avoid future spending increases: Policy choices may focus on preventing future increases via freezes or reducing annual rates of increase, as federal spending has not declined year-over-year in nominal dollars since at least 1970. Annual growth rates since 2001 in the top three expenditure categories (Healthcare, Social Security, and Defense) are far above the economic growth rate. 
*Invest productively: Some spending can be categorized as investments that lower future deficits. For example, if infrastructure, education or R&D investments could make U.S. workers and products more competitive or generate a revenue stream, these could reduce future deficits. Examples might include installing windows that reduce energy costs, toll roads and bridges, or power plants. <ref name="Bittle 2011" />
*Avoid uncertainty and unnecessary regulation: Complex legislation may create uncertainty regarding future costs of doing business, which affects investment decisions made by businesses and households. <ref>[http://www.chamberpost.com/2011/08/another-%E2%80%9Cpivot%E2%80%9D-back-to-jobs/ U.S. Chamber of Commerce-Another Pivot Back to Jobs-Retrieved September 2011]</ref>
*Implement budget process reforms: Budget rules could be implemented that require new legislation or programs to be funded by either cutting other spending or raising taxes (i.e., "Pay as you go" or [[PAYGO]] rules.)<ref name="gao.gov">[http://www.gao.gov/cghome/d08446cg.pdf GAO-U.S. Financial Condition and Fiscal Future Briefing-David Walker-January 2008]</ref> . 

===Taxation and spending strategies===. 
[[File:Comparative Revenue and Spending Increases.png|thumb|350px|right|Discretionary spending, mandatory spending, and revenue increases over nine-year intervals]] . 

Historically, government spending has not declined year-over-year in nominal terms since at least 1971. However, by limiting the rate of growth in discretionary spending (defense and non-defense) while growing revenues, the budget was balanced from 1998-2001. From 1990 to 1999, discretionary spending grew by a total of 14%, while revenues grew 77%. In contrast, from 2000–2009, discretionary spending grew by a total of 101% while revenues grew only 4% (see graphic at right). <ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12039/HistoricalTables%5B1%5D.pdf CBO Historical Tables 1971-2010]</ref> . 

In January 2008, then [[Comptroller General of the United States|GAO Director]] [[David M. Walker (U.S. Comptroller General)|David Walker]] presented a strategy for addressing what he called the federal budget "burning platform" and "unsustainable fiscal policy." This included improved financial reporting to better capture the obligations of the government; public education; improved budgetary and legislative processes, such as "pay as you go" rules; the restructure of entitlement programs and tax policy; and creation of a bi-partisan fiscal reform commission. He pointed to four types of "deficits" that make up the problem: budget, [[trade deficit|trade]], savings and leadership. <ref name="gao.gov"/> . 

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] has recommended a series of policy and economic actions to address the budget deficit. He wrote in February 2011: "What would a serious approach to our fiscal problems involve? I can summarize it in seven words: health care, health care, health care, revenue...Long-run projections suggest that spending on the major entitlement programs will rise sharply over the decades ahead, but the great bulk of that rise will come from the health insurance programs, not Social Security. So anyone who is really serious about the budget should be focusing mainly on health care...[by] getting behind specific [[Health care reforms proposed during the Obama administration|actions]] to rein in costs."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/18/opinion/18krugman.html?_r=1&ref=opinion NYT-Paul Krugman-Willie Sutton Wept-February 2011]</ref> . 

Economist [[Nouriel Roubini]] wrote in May 2010: "There are only two solutions to the sovereign debt crisis — raise taxes or cut spending — but the political gridlock may prevent either from happening...In the US, the average tax burden as a share of GDP is much lower than in other advanced economies. The right adjustment for the US would be to phase in revenue increases gradually over time so that you don't kill the recovery while controlling the growth of government spending."<ref>[http://gulfnews.com/business/opinion/us-faces-inflation-or-default-1.622397 Gulfnews-Nouriel Roubini-U.S. Faces Inflation or Default-May 2010]</ref> . 

[[David Leonhardt]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in March 2010: "For now, political leaders in both parties are still in denial about what the solution will entail. To be fair, so is much of the public. What needs to happen? Spending will need to be cut, ''and'' taxes will need to rise. They won’t need to rise just on households making more than $250,000, as Mr. Obama has suggested. They will probably need to rise on your household, however much you make...A solution that relied only on spending cuts would dismantle some bedrock parts of modern American society...A solution that relied only on taxes would muzzle economic growth."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/17/business/economy/17leonhardt.html?hp Leonhardt-NYT-The Perils of Pay Less, Get More-March 16, 2010]</ref> . 

Fed Chair [[Ben Bernanke]] stated in April 2010: "Thus, the reality is that the Congress, the Administration, and the American people will have to choose among making modifications to entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security, restraining federal spending on everything else, accepting higher taxes, or some combination thereof."<ref name="federalreserve.gov">[http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20100427a.htm Ben Bernanke-Speech before the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform-April 2010]</ref> . 

Journalist [[Steven Pearlstein]] advocated in May 2010 a comprehensive series of budgetary reforms. These included: Spending caps on Medicare and Medicaid; gradually raising the eligibility age for Social Security and Medicare; limiting discretionary spending increases to the rate of inflation; and imposing a [[value-added tax]]. <ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/11/AR2010051105000.html Washington Post-Steven Pearlstein-Solving the Deficit Problem Requires an Open Mind, Common Sense and Courage-May 2010]</ref> Journalist [[Robert J. Samuelson]] also recommended a ten-point deficit reduction plan. <ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/10-ways-to-fix-the-budget/2011/08/14/gIQA5xriFJ_story.html Washington Post-Robert J.

===Growth and employment strategies=== . 

[[Paul Krugman]] wrote in August 2011: "What would a real response to our problems involve? First of all, it would involve more, not less, government spending for the time being — with mass unemployment and incredibly low borrowing costs, we should be rebuilding our schools, our roads, our water systems and more. It would involve aggressive moves to reduce [[household debt]] via mortgage forgiveness and refinancing. And it would involve an all-out effort by the Federal Reserve to get the economy moving, with the deliberate goal of generating higher inflation to help alleviate debt problems."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/12/opinion/the-hijacked-crisis.html?_r=1 NYT-Krugman-The Hijacked Crisis-August 2011]</ref> . 

Economist [[Robert Reich]] wrote in September 2011 that political policies have resulted in relatively stagnant U.S. wages for the middle class since 1979 and record income inequality. Despite more women entering the workforce to provide two family incomes, U.S. consumption became increasingly debt-financed and unsustainable. He advocated higher taxation on the wealthy, stronger safety nets, strengthening labor unions (which represented less than 8% of the private labor force), Medicare for all, raising the average wages in trading partner countries, and a focus on education. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/opinion/sunday/jobs-will-follow-a-strengthening-of-the-middle-class.html?ref=global NYT-Robert Reich-The Limping Middle Class-September 2011]</ref> . 

Economist [[Michael Spence]] explained in August 2011 that over the 1990-2008 period, job creation was almost entirely in the "non-tradable" sector (which produces goods and services that must be consumed domestically, like healthcare) with few jobs created in the "tradable" sector (which produces goods that can be sold internationally, like manufacturing). He stated that job creation in both sectors is necessary and that various factors, such as the housing bubble, hid the lack of job creation in the tradable sector. He stated: "We’re going to have to try to fix the ineffective parts of our educational system...We’re under-investing in things like infrastructure...we’ve just been living on consumption and we need to live a little bit more on investment, including public-sector investment." He also advocated tax policy changes to encourage hiring of U.S. workers. <ref>[https://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/PDFDownload.aspx?ar=2849 McKinsey Quarterly-Michael Spence-August 2011]</ref> . 

Former Treasury Secretary [[Lawrence Summers]] mentioned the importance of economic growth and job creation as critical to addressing the deficit issue during July 2011. <ref name="transcripts.cnn.com">[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1107/17/fzgps.01.html CNN's Fareed Zakaria GPS-Larry Summers Interview Transcript-July 17, 2011]</ref> The President's 2012 budget forecasts annual real GDP growth averaging 3.2% from 2011-2021 (3.7% from 2011–2016 and 2.6% from 2017-2021.)<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2012/assets/tables.pdf OMB-President's 2012 Budget-Table S-13]</ref> The change in real GDP was -0.3% in 2008, -3.5% in 2009 and +3.0% in 2010.

Conservative organizations such as the [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]] have advocated growth and employment strategies based on a reduction in government regulations; empowering state education systems; teacher pay for performance strategies; training programs better focused on available jobs; creation of a private and public infrastructure bank to finance investments; tax rate reductions for corporations; free trade agreements; and reducing labor union power. <ref>[http://www.uschamber.com/ U.S. Chamber of Commerce]</ref> . 

===Balancing economic growth with deficit reduction===. 
Actions can be taken now to encourage economic growth while implementing measures that reduce future deficits. [[Ben Bernanke]] wrote in September 2011: "...the two goals--achieving fiscal sustainability, which is the result of responsible policies set in place for the longer term, and avoiding creation of fiscal headwinds for the recovery--are not incompatible. Acting now to put in place a credible plan for reducing future deficits over the long term, while being attentive to the implications of fiscal choices for the recovery in the near term, can help serve both objectives."<ref>[http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20110908a.htm Federal Reserve-Ben Bernanke-The U.S. Economic Outlook-September 2011]</ref> . 

CBO has reported that if current laws are allowed to take effect as scheduled (e.g., if significant tax cuts expire at the end of 2012 and the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]] is implemented) the short-term deficit problem essentially goes away by 2021, assuming a return to pre-crisis growth rates. <ref name="ReferenceC">[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/123xx/doc12316/Update_SummaryforWeb.pdf CBO-The Budget and Economic Outlook-August 2011]</ref> Since the path forward on healthcare cost reform is unclear and other countries have much lower costs relative to GDP with comparable results on key measures, various studies could be conducted today to determine future policy actions. <ref>[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/06/01/090601fa_fact_gawande The New Yorker-Atul Gawande-The Cost Conundrum-June 2009]</ref><ref>[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/12/14/091214fa_fact_gawande The New Yorker-Atul Gawande-Testing, Testing-December 2009]</ref> . 

===National Research Council strategies===. 
During January 2010, the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] and the [[National Academy of Public Administration (United States)|National Academy of Public Administration]] reported a series of strategies to address the problem. They included four scenarios designed to prevent the public debt to GDP ratio from exceeding 60%: . 

{{Quotation|
#Low spending and low taxes. This path would allow payroll and income tax rates to remain roughly unchanged, but it would require sharp reductions in the projected growth of health and retirement programs; defense and domestic spending cuts of 20 percent; and no funds for any new programs without additional spending cuts. 
#Intermediate path 1. This path would raise income and payroll tax rates modestly.  It would allow for some growth in health and retirement spending; defense and domestic program cuts of 8 percent; and selected new public investments, such as for the environment and to promote economic growth. 
#Intermediate path 2. This path would raise income and payroll taxes somewhat higher than with the previous path.  Spending growth for health and retirement programs would be slowed, but less than under the other intermediate path; and spending for all other federal responsibilities would be reduced.  This path gives higher priority to entitlement programs for the elderly than to other types of government spending. 
#High spending and taxes.  This path would require substantially higher taxes.  It would maintain the projected growth in Social Security benefits for all future retirees and require smaller reductions over time in the growth of spending for health programs.  It would allow spending on all other federal programs to be higher than the level implied by current policies. <ref>[http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12808 ]</ref><ref>[http://www.fiscalcommission.gov/files/fiscal_commission_penner_testimony.pdf Fiscal Reform Commission-Testimony of Rudolph Penner-April 2010]</ref>}} . 

===Allowing current laws to take effect===. 
[[File:CBO Budget Deficit Assuming Continuation of Policies.png|300px|right|U.S. Federal budget deficit as % GDP assuming continuation of certain policies 2011-2021]] . 

Significant reduction in deficits occurs if laws already on the books in 2011 are allowed to take effect. Over the 2012-2021 period, an estimated $1.2 trillion in spending reductions will occur if the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]] is allowed to take effect. Further, expiration of the [[Bush Tax Cuts]] and other tax cuts passed during President Obama's administration are scheduled to occur in 2012, which add $4.7 trillion in revenue over a decade. According to CBO, letting current laws take effect will bring the budget into primary balance (i.e., excluding interest) by 2014. <ref>[http://money.cnn.com/2011/11/29/news/economy/national_debt_bixby/index.htm CNN Money-Debt Crisis Must Be Solved in the Open-Robert Bixby-November 29, 2011]</ref> . 

Specifically, allowing laws on the books in 2011 to take effect would reduce future debts by up to $7.1 trillion over a decade:
*$3.3T from letting temporary income and estate tax cuts enacted in 2001, 2003, 2009, and 2010 expire on schedule at the end of 2012;
*$1.2T from letting the sequestration of spending required if the Joint Committee does not produce $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction take effect (i.e., implementing the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]]);
*$0.8T other temporary tax cut expirations (the “extenders” that Congress has regularly extended on a “temporary” basis) expire on schedule;
*$0.3T from letting cuts in Medicare physician reimbursements scheduled under current law (required under the Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate formula enacted in 1997, but which have been postponed since 2003) take effect (i.e., no longer applying the [[Doc fix]]);
*$0.7T from letting the temporary increase in the exemption amount under the Alternative Minimum Tax expire, thereby returning the exemption to the level in effect in 2001;
*$0.9T in lower interest payments on the debt as a result of the deficit reduction achieved from not extending these current policies. <ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/post/why-doing-nothing-yields-71-trillion-in-deficit-cuts/2011/11/16/gIQAsOdwRN_blog.html Washington Post-EJ Dionne-Why Doing Nothing Yields $7.1 trillion in deficit cuts-November 16, 2011]</ref> .

===Raising eligibility ages for Social Security and Medicare===. 
CBO estimated in January 2012 that raising the full retirement age for Social Security from 67 to 70 would reduce outlays by about 13%. Raising the early retirement age from 62 to 64 has little impact, as those who wait longer to begin receiving benefits get a higher amount. Over the long-term, CBO estimates raising the Social Security retirement age increases the size of the workforce and the size of the economy marginally. Raising the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67 would reduce Medicare costs by 5%. <ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=12531 CBO - Raising the Ages of Eligibility for Social Security and Medicare-January 2012]</ref> .

[[File:Republican Proposal - Federal Spending as percent GDP.png|thumb|350px|right|CBO - Federal Spending as %GDP Under Alternative Scenarios and Ryan's Path]] . 

Rep. [[Paul Ryan (politician)|Paul Ryan]] (R) has proposed the ''Roadmap for America's Future'', which is a series of budgetary reforms. His January 2010 version of the plan includes partial privatization of Social Security, the transition of Medicare to a voucher system, discretionary spending cuts and freezes, and tax reform. <ref>[http://www.roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov/ Republican Website-Roadmap for America's Future]</ref> A series of graphs and charts summarizing the impact of the plan are included. <ref>[http://www.roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov/plan/charts.htm Roadmap for America's Future-Charts & Graphs-February 2010]</ref> Economists have both praised and criticized particular features of the plan. <ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/12/AR2010021202382.html?hpid=opinionsbox1 Washington Post-Robert Samuelson-Paul Ryan's Lonely Challenge-February 2010]</ref><ref>[http://www.forbes.com/2010/02/11/cut-spending-taxes-budget-medicare-paul-ryan-opinions-columnists-bruce-bartlett.html Forbes-Bartlett-Paul Ryan's Budgetary Holy Grail-February 2010]</ref> The CBO also did a partial evaluation of the bill. <ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/108xx/doc10851/01-27-Ryan-Roadmap-Letter.pdf CBO-Ryan Roadmap Letter-January 2010]</ref> The [[Center for Budget and Policy Priorities]] (CBPP) was very critical of the Roadmap. <ref>[http://www.cbpp.org/files/3-10-10bud.pdf CBPP-Ryan Bill Analysis-March 10, 2010]</ref> Rep.

The House of Representatives Committee on the Budget, chaired by Paul Ryan, released a budget resolution in April 2011, titled [[The Path to Prosperity|''The Path to Prosperity: Restoring America's Promise'']]. The ''Path'' focuses on tax reform (lowering income tax rates and reducing tax expenditures or loopholes); spending cuts and controls; and redesign of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. It does not propose significant changes to Social Security. <ref>[http://budget.house.gov/fy2012budget/ House of Representatives-Committee on the Budget-Retrieved April 2011]</ref> The CBO did an analysis of the resolution (a less rigorous evaluation than full scoring of legislation), estimating that the ''Path'' would balance the budget by 2030 and reduce the level of debt held by the public to 10% GDP by 2050, vs. 62% in 2010. The ''Path'' assumes revenue collection of 19% GDP after 2022, up from the current 15% GDP and closer to the historical average of 18.3% GDP. A grouping of spending categories called "Other Mandatory and Defense and Non-Defense Discretionary spending" would be reduced from 12% GDP in 2010 to 3.5% by 2050. <ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=12128 CBO-Long-Term Analysis of a Budget Proposal by Chairman Ryan-April 5 2011]</ref> Economist [[Paul Krugman]] called it "ridiculous and heartless" due to a combination of income tax rate reductions (which he argued mainly benefit the wealthy) and large spending cuts that would affect the poor and middle classes. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/08/opinion/08krugman.html?_r=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss Paul Krugman-Ludicrous and Cruel-April 7, 2011]</ref><ref>[http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/08/ryan-and-taxes/?ref=opinion Paul Krugman-Ryan and Taxes-April 8, 2011]</ref> . 

The Republican Party website includes an alternative budget proposal provided to the President in January 2010.

===Fiscal reform commission===. 
President Obama established a budget reform commission, the [[National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform]], during February, 2010. The Commission "shall propose recommendations designed to balance the budget, excluding interest payments on the debt, by 2015. This result is projected to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio at an acceptable level once the economy recovers." Unfortunately the Commission was unable to garner the required supermajority of its members in support of its proposals, and disbanded without issuing an official report to Congress. <ref>[http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/88612/20101203/debt-deficit.htm]</ref> The final, failed draft report, which received 11 of the required 14 votes for approval, was released to the public in December 2010. <ref>[http://www.fiscalcommission.gov/sites/fiscalcommission.gov/files/documents/TheMomentofTruth12_1_2010.pdf Fiscal Commission-Final Report-December 2010]</ref> . 

The Commission released a draft of its proposals on November 10, 2010. It included various tax and spend adjustments to bring long-run government tax revenue and spending into line at approximately 21% of GDP. For fiscal year 2009, tax revenues were approximately 15% of GDP and spending was 24% of GDP. The Co-chairs summary of the plan states that it:
*Achieves nearly $4 trillion in deficit reduction through 2020 via 50+ specific ways to cut outdated programs and strengthen competitiveness by making Washington cut and invest, not borrow and spend. 
*Reduces the deficit to 2.2% of GDP by 2015, exceeding President’s goal of primary balance (about 3% of GDP). 
*Reduces tax rates, abolishes the [[alternative minimum tax]], and cuts backdoor spending (e.g., mortgage interest deductions) in the tax code. 
*Stabilizes debt by 2014 and reduces debt to 60% of GDP by 2024 and 40% by 2037. 
*Ensures lasting Social Security solvency, prevents projected 22% cuts in 2037, reduces elderly poverty, and distributes burden fairly. <ref>[http://www.fiscalcommission.gov/sites/fiscalcommission.gov/files/documents/CoChair_Draft.pdf Nation Commission-Co-Chairs Report Draft-November 10,2010]</ref> . 

The [[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]] evaluated the draft plan, praising that it "puts everything on the table" but criticizing that it "lacks an appropriate balance between program cuts and revenue increases."<ref>[http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=3325 CBPP-Bowles Simpson Plan Evaluation-November 16,2010]</ref> . 

===President Obama's proposals===. 
====Budgets and April 2011 proposal====. 
President Obama outlined his strategy for reducing future deficits in April 2011 and explained why this debate is important: "...as the Baby Boomers start to retire in greater numbers and health care costs continue to rise, the situation will get even worse. By 2025, the amount of taxes we currently pay will only be enough to finance our health care programs -- Medicare and Medicaid -- Social Security, and the interest we owe on our debt. That’s it. Every other national priority -– education, transportation, even our national security-–will have to be paid for with borrowed money." He warned that interest payments may reach $1 trillion annually by the end of the decade.  . 

He outlined core principles of his proposal, which includes investments in key areas while reducing future expenditures. "I will not sacrifice the core investments that we need to grow and create jobs. We will invest in medical research. We will invest in clean energy technology. We will invest in new roads and airports and broadband access. We will invest in education. We will invest in job training. We will do what we need to do to compete, and we will win the future." He outlined his proposals for reducing future deficits, by:
*Reducing non-defense discretionary spending, by freezing or limiting increases in future spending;
*Finding savings in the defense budget, building on $400 billion in savings already identified by Defense Secretary Gates;
*Reducing healthcare spending, by reducing subsidies and erroneous payments, negotiating for lower prescription drug prices and use of generics, improving efficiencies in the Medicaid program, altering doctor incentives, and empowering a panel of experts to recommend cost-effective treatments and solutions;
*Strengthening the Social Security program, without reducing commitments to current or future retirees (by implication revenue increases); and
*Raising revenues, primarily by raising taxes on the wealthy and reducing certain types of tax expenditures. <ref name="whitehouse1">[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/13/remarks-president-fiscal-policy President Obama-Remarks by the President on Fiscal Policy-April 13, 2011]</ref> . 

President Obama's actual 2012 budget proposal was defeated in the Senate by a margin of 0-97 votes. <ref>[http://washingtonexaminer.com/blogs/beltway-confidential/2011/05/zero-democrats-vote-proceed-obama-budget-fails-0-97 Zero Democrats vote to proceed on Obama budget, fails 0-97]</ref> . 

====September 2011 proposal====. 
President Obama announced a 10-year (2012–2021) plan in September 2011 called: "Living Within Our Means and Investing in the Future: The President’s Plan for Economic Growth and Deficit Reduction." The plan included tax increases on the wealthy, along with cuts in future spending on defense and Medicare.  Social Security was excluded from the plan. The plan included $3,670 billion in deficit reduction over 10 years, offset by  $447 billion in deficit increases (spending and tax cuts) for the proposed [[American Jobs Act]], for a net deficit reduction of $3,222 billion. If the recently passed [[Budget Control Act of 2011]] is included, this adds another $1,180 billion in deficit reduction for a total of $4,403 billion. Plan estimates indicate that if all these measures were implemented, the deficit in 2021 would be 2.3% GDP or $565 billion. Key categories of savings over the 10 years included in the $3,670 billion are:
*Mandatory program savings $257B;
*Health savings $320B;
*Reduction in military spending related to the wars $1,084B;
*Tax increases and reform of $1,573B; and

The [[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]] supported the proposal, stating: "President Obama proposed a balanced and well-designed package today that would boost economic growth and jobs in the short run while stabilizing federal debt as a share of the economy after 2013. By keeping federal debt held by the public from growing as a share of the economy, the President's proposal would meet the definition of a 'sustainable budget' that economists often use."

===Congressional Progressive Caucus "The People's Budget"===. 
The Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) consists of 75 members of the House of Representatives and one senator. It proposed "The People's Budget" in April 2011, which includes the following recommendations, which it claims would balance the budget by 2021 while maintaining debt as a % GDP under 65%:
*Reversing most of the Bush tax cuts;
*Reinstating historical marginal income tax rates of approximately 50% on income earners over $1 million;
*Taxing capital gains and qualified dividends as ordinary income;
*Raising the income tax cap ($106,800) on the Social Security payroll tax;
*Restoring the estate tax;
*Reducing tax subsidies for corporations, particularly in the oil and gas industries;
*Ending overseas contingency defense spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan;
*Reducing defense spending overall and reducing the U.S. global defense footprint;
*Investing in a jobs program; and
*Implementing a public option to reduce healthcare costs. <ref>[http://grijalva.house.gov/uploads/The%20CPC%20FY2012%20Budget.pdf CPC-The People's Budget-April 2011]</ref> . 

The [[Economic Policy Institute]], a liberal think tank, evaluated the proposal. <ref>[http://www.epi.org/publications/entry/news_from_epi_peoples_budget_offers_sound_alternative_to_ryans_draconian_pl/ Economic Policy Institute-Evaluation of CPC Budget Proposal-April 2011]</ref> The Economist also discussed it. <ref>[http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2011/04/debt_proposals Economist-The Courageous Progressive Caucus Budget-April 2011]</ref> Economist [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in April 2011: "It’s worth pointing out that if you want to balance the budget in 10 years, you pretty much must do it largely by cutting defense and raising taxes; you can’t make huge cuts in the rest of the budget without inflicting extreme pain on millions of Americans."<ref>[http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/22/the-progressive-budget-alternative/NYT-Paul Krugman-The Progressive Budget Alternative-April 2011]</ref> . 

===Other solution proposals===. 
The Peter G. Peterson Foundation solicited proposals from six organizations, which included the American Enterprise Institute, the [[Bipartisan Policy Center]], the Center for American Progress, the Economic Policy Institute, The Heritage Foundation, and the Roosevelt Institute Campus Network.  These proposals were reviewed by a former CBO director and the Tax Policy Institute to provide a common scoring mechanism. The recommendations of each group were reported in May 2011. <ref name="PGPF-Solutions Summit-May 2011">[http://pgpf.org/Issues/Fiscal-Outlook/2011/01/20/PGPF-Announces-Grants-to-Six-Institutions-to-Develop-Solutions-to-Americas-Fiscal-Challenges.aspx PGPF-Solutions Summit-May 2011]</ref> . 

The [[Bipartisan Policy Center]] sponsored a Debt Reduction Task Force, co-chaired by [[Pete V. Domenici]] and [[Alice M. Rivlin]]. This panel created a report called "Restoring America's Future," which was published in November 2010. The plan claimed to stabilize the debt to GDP ratio at 60%, with up to $6 trillion in debt reduction over the 2011-2020 period. Specific plan elements included:
*Freeze defense spending for 5 years, after which defense spending would be held to the rate of GDP growth;
*Freeze non-defense discretionary spending for 4 years, after which it would be capped at the rate of GDP growth;
*Reduce the current six income tax rates to just two (15% and 27%). It would reduce the corporate tax rate to 27% from 35% today. The panel would also eliminate most tax expenditures (roughly $1 trillion per year), with the exception of the mortgage interest and charitable deductions. 
*Implement a national sales tax or [[value-added tax]] (VAT), starting at 3% in 2012 and rising to 6.5% by 2013. 
*Reform Social Security, by raising the cap on the payroll tax, reducing the annual cost of living adjustment, and reducing benefits for those who retire early. <ref>[http://www.bipartisanpolicy.org/projects/debt-initiative/about Bipartisan Policy Center Domenici-Rivlin Debt Reduction Task Force-]</ref><ref>[http://money.cnn.com/2010/11/17/news/economy/debt_commission_rivlin_domenici/index.htm CNN-Jeanne Sahadi-New Deficit Plan Would Cut $6 trillion-November 2010]</ref> .

Then OMB Director [[Peter Orszag]] stated in a November 2009 interview: "It's very popular to complain about the deficit, but then many of the specific steps that you could take to address it are unpopular. And that is the fundamental challenge that we are facing, and that we need help both from the American public and Congress in addressing." He characterized the budget problem in two parts: a short- to medium-term problem related to the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]], which has reduced tax revenues significantly and involved large stimulus spending; and a long-term problem primarily driven by increasing healthcare costs per person. He argued that the U.S. cannot return to a sustainable long-term fiscal path by either tax increases or cuts to non-healthcare cost categories alone; the U.S. must confront the rising healthcare costs driving expenditures in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. <ref name="charlierose.com">[http://www.charlierose.com/download/transcript/10697 Charlie Rose Show-Peter Orszag Interview-November 3, 2009]</ref> . 

[[Fareed Zakaria]] said in February 2010: "But, in one sense, Washington is delivering to the American people exactly what they seem to want. In poll after poll, we find that the public is generally opposed to any new taxes, but we also discover that the public will immediately punish anyone who proposes spending cuts in any middle class program which are the ones where the money is in the federal budget. Now, there is only one way to square this circle short of magic, and that is to borrow money, and that is what we have done for decades now at the local, state and federal level...So, the next time you accuse Washington of being irresponsible, save some of that blame for yourself and your friends."<ref>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1002/21/fzgps.01.html Zakaria GPS-February 21, 2010]</ref> . 

[[Andrew Sullivan]] said in March 2010: "...the biggest problem in this country is...they're big babies. I mean, people keep saying they don't want any tax increases, but they don't want to have their Medicare cut, they don't want to have their Medicaid [cut] or they don't want to have their Social Security touched an inch. Well, it's about time someone tells them, you can't have it, baby...You have to make a choice. And I fear that—and I always thought, you see, that that was the Conservative position. The Conservative is the Grinch who says no. And, in some ways, I think this in the long run, looking back in history, was Reagan's greatest bad legacy, which is he tried to tell people you can have it all. We can't have it all."<ref>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1004/04/fzgps.01.html Zakaria GPS-April 4,2010]</ref> . 

Harvard historian [[Niall Ferguson]] stated in a November 2009 interview: "The United States is on an unsustainable fiscal path. And we know that path ends in one of two ways; you either default on that debt, or you depreciate it away. You inflate it away with your currency effectively." He said the most likely case is that the U.S. would default on its entitlement obligations for Social Security and Medicare first, by reducing the obligations through entitlement reform. He also warned about the risk that foreign investors would demand a higher interest rate to purchase U.S. debt, damaging U.S. growth prospects. <ref>[http://www.charlierose.com/ Charlie Rose Interview with Niall Ferguson-November 3, 2009]</ref> . 

Economist [[Herbert Stein]] is quoted as saying: "Trends that can't continue, won't." In May 2011, the Wells Fargo Economics Group wrote that: "The failure to control spending will result in some combination of higher inflation, higher interest rates, a weaker dollar, weaker economic growth and, hence, a lower standard of living in the United States..."<ref>[https://www.wellsfargo.com/downloads/pdf/com/research/special_reports/2012FederalBudgetandDebtCeiling_05162011.pdf Wells Fargo Economics-Raise the Roof: A Perspective on Federal Spending-May 16, 2011]</ref> [[Thomas Friedman]] wrote in September 2011: "But as long as every solution that is hard is off the table, then our slow national decline will remain on the table."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/07/opinion/friedman-the-whole-truth-and-nothing-but.html?src=recg Thomas Friedman-NYT-The Whole Truth and Nothing But-September 2011]</ref> . 

==Polls==. 
According to a CBS News/New York Times poll in July 2009, 56% of people were opposed to paying more taxes to reduce the deficit and 53% were also opposed to cutting spending. According to a Pew Research poll in June 2009, there was no single category of spending that a majority of Americans favored cutting. Only cuts in foreign aid (less than 1% of the budget), polled higher than 33%. Economist Bruce Bartlett wrote in December 2009: "Nevertheless, I can't really blame members of Congress for lacking the courage or responsibility to get the budget under some semblance of control. All the evidence suggests that they are just doing what voters want them to do, which is nothing."<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/2009/12/17/budget-commission-deficit-opinions-columnists-bruce-bartlett.html Bartlett-Forbes-Not Another Budget Commission!-December 2010]</ref> . 

A Bloomberg/Selzer national poll conducted in December 2009 indicated that more than two-thirds of Americans favored tax increases on the rich (individuals making over $500,000) to help solve the deficit problem. Further, an across-the-board 5% cut in all federal discretionary spending would be supported by 57%; this category is about 30% of federal spending. Only 26% favored tax increases on the middle class and only 23% favored reducing the growth rate in entitlements, such as Social Security. <ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=awkrRPMONDW8&pos=9 Americans want government to spend for jobs, send bill to rich]</ref><ref>[http://media.bloomberg.com/bb/avfile/rkt5pqJYr5tM Bloomberg/Selzer-Poll Data Detail]</ref> . 

A Rasmussen Reports survey in February 2010 showed that only 35% of voters correctly believe that the majority of federal spending goes to just defense, Social Security and Medicare. Forty-four percent (44%) say it’s not true, and 20% are not sure.

A January 2010 Rasmussen report showed that overall, 57% would like to see a cut in government spending, 23% favor a freeze, and 12% say the government should increase spending. Republicans and unaffiliated voters overwhelmingly favor spending cuts. Democrats are evenly divided between spending cuts and a spending freeze. <ref>[http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/obama_administration/january_2010/9_expect_obama_s_spending_freeze_to_have_big_impact_on_deficit Rassmussen Reports-January 28, 2010]</ref> . 

According to a Pew Research poll in March 2010, 31% of Republicans would be willing to decrease military spending to bring down the deficit. A majority of Democrats (55%) and 46% of Independents say they would accept cuts in military spending to reduce the deficit. <ref>[http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1519/deficit-concerns-rise-little-support-for-spending-cuts Pew Research-Deficit Concerns Rise, but Solutions are Elusive-March 2010]</ref> . 

A National Journal poll in February 2012 reported: "When asked to identify the biggest reason the federal government faces large deficits for the coming years, just 3 percent of those surveyed said it was because of 'too much government spending on programs for the elderly'; only 14 percent said the principal reason was 'too much government spending on programs for poor people.' Those explanations were dwarfed by the 24 percent who attributed the deficits primarily to excessive defense spending, and the 46 percent plurality who said their principal cause was that 'wealthy Americans don’t pay enough in taxes.'  While minorities were more likely than whites to pin the blame on the wealthy avoiding taxes, even 43 percent of whites agreed."<ref>[http://www.nationaljournal.com/daily/poll-americans-split-on-concern-for-very-poor-20120213 National Journal-Americans Split on Concern for Very Poor-February 2012]</ref> . 

==Conclusion and next steps==. 
The CBO reported in September 2011 that: "Given the aging of the population and rising costs for health care, attaining a sustainable federal budget will require the United States to deviate from the policies of the past 40 years in at least one of the following ways:
*Raise federal revenues significantly above their average share of GDP;
*Make major changes to the sorts of benefits provided for Americans when they become older; or
*Substantially reduce the role of the rest of the federal government relative to the size of the economy."<ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/124xx/doc12419/CBO_Presentation_to_Macroeconomic_Advisers_9-14-11_Final.pdf CBO CBO-Presentation to Macroeconomic Advisers-September 2011]</ref> . 

During testimony before the Congressional Joint Deficit Reduction Committee in September 2011, CBO Director [[Douglas Elmendorf]] counseled members of Congress to make decisions about the role of the federal government, then make policy choices to obtain the revenue necessary to fund those roles, to put the U.S. on a sustainable fiscal path. <ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=12413 CBO-Confronting the Nation's Fiscal Policy Challenges-September 2011]</ref> . 

Fed Chair [[Ben Bernanke]] stated in January 2007: "The longer we wait, the more severe, the more draconian, the more difficult the objectives are going to be. I think the right time to start was about 10 years ago."<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16688089/ns/business-stocks_and_economy/t/bernanke-warns-vicious-cycle-deficits/ MSNBC-Bernanke Warns of Vicious Cycle in Deficits-January 18, 2007]</ref> .
