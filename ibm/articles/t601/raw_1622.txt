"We are the 99%" is a [[political slogan]] and an implicit [[economics|economic claim]] of [["Occupy" protests|"Occupy" protesters]]. It refers to the increased concentration of wealth since the 1970s among the top 1% of income earners in the United States. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] says that between 1979 and 2007 incomes of the top 1% of Americans grew by an average of 275%. During the same time period, the 60% of Americans in the middle of the income scale saw their income rise by 40%. Since 1979 the average pre-tax income for the bottom 90% of households has decreased by $900, while that of the top 1% increased by over $700,000, as federal taxation became less [[Progressive tax|progressive]].

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] writes that "the slogan correctly defines the issue as being the middle class versus the elite and also gets past the common but wrong notion that rising inequality is mainly about the well educated doing better than the less educated." However, he says that if anything, the 99 percent slogan aims too low because a large fraction of the top 1 percent’s gains have actually gone to an even smaller group, the top 0.1 percent — the richest one-thousandth of the population. Krugman argues against even further tax cuts for the very rich because they are "job creators", calling it propaganda. He argues that very few of the super-wealthy are job innovators, most of them are "corporate bigwigs and financial wheeler-dealers", and he refers to a recent analysis that found that 43 percent of the super-elite are executives at nonfinancial companies, 18 percent are in finance and another 12 percent are lawyers or in real estate. Commenting on the ongoing economic crisis he writes, "[the] seemingly high returns before the crisis simply reflected increased risk-taking — risk that was mostly borne not by the wheeler-dealers themselves but either by naïve investors or by taxpayers, who ended up holding the bag when it all went wrong". <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/25/opinion/we-are-the-99-9.html | work=The New York Times | first=Paul | last=Krugman | title=We Are the 99.9% | date=November 24, 2011}}</ref> .

According to a 2011 article by [[CNBC]] writer Jeff Cox,<ref name="CNBC"/> the 1% does not constitute merely corporate CEOs, bankers or stock traders, but also people in occupations not typically targeted by wealth disparity protestors. Based on a 2010 study by Jon Bakija et al. covering data since 2005, executives, managers and non-financial supervisors make up 6.35% of the 1%, while finance professionals make up 2.77%, doctors 1.85% and lawyers 1.22%. Other occupations such as farmers, scientists, pilots, real estate professionals and entertainers each comprise about 0.5% of the 1 Percenters. Cox states that sources vary on the minimum yearly income to be considered among the 1%, ranging from about $500,000 to $1.3 million, whereas CEO salaries average $3.9 million, $10.6 million for those whose companies are in the Standard & Poor’s 500 and $19.8 million for companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Cox adds that the wealthiest of the 1% (that is, the .01%), make only 19% of their income through their salaries, and make the rest through investment income, which are taxed at different rates, that they pay a disproportionate amount of their incomes to income tax, having paid 40% of the total federal personal income tax in 2006, whereas the 5 Percenters paid 60%. <ref name="CNBC">Cox, Jeff. [http://www.cnbc.com/id/44960983?__source=google|editorspicks|&par=google "Protests Target 'One Percent,' But Who Exactly Are They?"]. [[CNBC]]. October 19, 2011. </ref> . 

Cox also states that the phenomenon of wealth concentration among a small segment of the population is a century old, and argues a direct correlation between this and the health of the stock market, stating that 36.7% of the United States' wealth was controlled by the 1% in 1922, 44.2% when the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crashed in 1929]], 19.9% in 1976, and has increased since then. Cox also says that it has intensified at the same time that the United States changed from a manufacturing leader to a financial services leader. Cox takes issue with protestors' focus on income and wealth, and with their embrace of allies such as [[Susan Sarandon]] and [[Russell Simmons]], who are themselves in the 1%. <ref name=CNBC/>  Joseph Barro of ''[[National Review]]'' offers similar arguments, asserting that the 1% includes those with incomes beginning at $593,000, which would exclude most [[Wall Street]] bankers. <ref name=nationalreview>Josh Barro.

In the United States Republicans have generally been critical of the movement accusing protesters and their supporters of class warfare. Newt Gingrich called the “concept of the 99 and the one” both divisive and “un-American”.  Democrats have offered "cautious support", using the "99%" slogan to argue for the passage of President Obama's jobs act, Internet access rules and voter identification laws, mine safety, and other issues.  But both parties agree that the movement has changed public debate.  In late February,  the New York Times  reported that, "Whatever the long-term effects of the Occupy Movement, protesters succeeded in implanting “we are the 99 percent” into the cultural and political lexicon."<ref>http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/o/occupy_wall_street/index.html</ref> .
