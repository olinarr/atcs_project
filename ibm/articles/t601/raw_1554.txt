'''Adverse selection''', '''anti-selection''', or '''negative selection''' is a term used in [[economics]], [[insurance]], [[statistics]], and [[risk management]]. It refers to a market process in which "bad" results occur when buyers and sellers have [[information asymmetries|asymmetric information]] (i.e. access to different information): the "bad" products or services are more likely to be selected. A bank that sets one price for all its checking account customers runs the risk of being adversely selected against by its low-balance, high-activity (and hence least profitable) customers. Two ways to '''model''' adverse selection are with [[signaling games]] and [[screening games]].  . 

==Example: insurance==. 
The term adverse selection was originally used in [[insurance]]. It describes a situation where an individual's demand for insurance (either the propensity to buy insurance, or the quantity purchased, or both) is positively correlated with the individual's risk of loss (e.g. higher risks buy more insurance), '''and''' the insurer is unable to allow for this correlation in the price of insurance. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/AdverseSelection/ |title=Adverse Selection |first=Seth J. |last=Chandler |work=[[The Wolfram Demonstrations Project]] }}</ref>  This may be because of private information known only to the individual ([[information asymmetry]]), or because of regulations or social norms which prevent the insurer from using certain categories of known information to set prices (e.g. the insurer may be prohibited from using information such as gender, ethnic origin, genetic test results, or preexisting medical conditions, the last of which amount to a 100% risk of the losses associated with the treatment of that condition).  The latter scenario is sometimes referred to as 'regulatory adverse selection'. <ref>{{cite journal |last=Polborn |first=M. K. |last2=Hoy |first2=M. |last3=Sadanand |first3=A. |year=2006 |title=Advantageous Effects of Regulatory Adverse Selection in the Life Insurance Market |journal=Economic Journal |volume=116 |issue=508 |pages=327–354 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.2006.01059.x }}</ref> . 

The potentially 'adverse' nature of this phenomenon can be illustrated by the link between smoking status and mortality.  Non-smokers, on average, are more likely to live longer, while smokers, on average, are more likely to die younger. If insurers do not vary prices for life insurance according to smoking status, life insurance will be a better buy for smokers than for non-smokers.  So smokers may be more likely to buy insurance, or may tend to buy larger amounts, than non-smokers.  The average mortality of the combined policyholder group will be higher than the average mortality of the general population.  From the insurer's viewpoint, the higher mortality of the group which 'selects' to buy insurance is 'adverse'.  The insurer raises the price of insurance accordingly.  As a consequence, non-smokers may be less likely to buy insurance (or may buy smaller amounts) than if they could buy at a lower price to reflect their lower risk.  The reduction in insurance purchase by non-smokers is also 'adverse' from the insurer's viewpoint, and perhaps also from a public policy viewpoint. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://coverhound.com/blog/post/adverse-selection-in-the-car-insurance-market |title=Adverse Selection in the Car Insurance Market |date=Jan 2011 |publisher=[[CoverHound]]}}</ref>   . 

Furthermore, if there is a range of increasing risk categories in the population, the increase in the insurance price due to adverse selection may lead the lowest remaining risks to cancel or not renew their insurance.  This leads to a further increase in price, and hence the lowest remaining risks cancel their insurance, leading to a further increase in price, and so on.  Eventually this 'adverse selection spiral' might in theory lead to the collapse of the insurance market.  . 

To counter the effects of adverse selection, insurers (to the extent that laws permit) ask a range of questions and may request medical or other reports on individuals who apply to buy insurance, so that the price quoted can be varied accordingly, and any unreasonably high or unpredictable risks rejected.  This risk selection process is known as [[underwriting]].  In many countries, insurance law incorporates an 'utmost good faith' or ''[[uberrima fides]]'' doctrine which requires potential customers to answer any underwriting questions asked by the insurer fully and honestly; if they fail to do this, the insurer may later refuse to pay claims.  . 

Whilst adverse selection in theory seems an obvious and inevitable consequence of economic incentives, empirical evidence is mixed.  Several studies investigating correlations between risk and insurance purchase have failed to show the predicted positive correlation for life insurance,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cawley |first=J. |last2=Philipson |first2=T. |title=An Empirical Examination of Barriers to Trade in Insurance |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=89 |issue=4 |year=1999 |pages=827–846 |jstor=117161 }}</ref> auto insurance,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Chiappori |first=P.

One reason why adverse selection may be muted in practice may be that insurers' [[underwriting]] is largely effective.  Another possible reason is negative correlation between [[risk aversion]] (''e.g.'', the willingness to purchase insurance) and risk level (estimated ''ex ante'' based on observation of the ''ex post'' occurrence rate of observed claims) in the population:  If risk aversion is higher amongst lower risk customers, such that persons less likely to engage in risk-increasing behavior are more likely to engage in risk-decreasing behavior (''i.e.'', to take affirmative steps to reduce risk), adverse selection can be reduced or even reversed, leading to 'propitious' or 'advantageous' selection. <ref>{{cite journal |last=Hemenway |first=D. |jstor=2937886 |title=Propitious selection |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=105 |issue=4 |year=1990 |pages=1063–1069 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=De Meza |first=D. |last2=Webb |first2=D. C. |title=Advantageous selection in insurance markets |journal=RAND Journal of Economics |volume=32 |issue=2 |year=2001 |pages=249–262 |jstor=2696408 }}</ref>  For example, there is evidence that smokers are more willing to do risky jobs than non-smokers,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Viscusi |first=W. K. |last2=Hersch |first2=J. |doi=10.1162/00346530151143806 |title=Cigarette smokers as job risk takers |journal=Review of Economics and Statistics |volume=83 |issue=2 |year=2001 |pages=269–280 |jstor= }}</ref> and this greater willingness to accept risk might reduce insurance purchase by smokers.  From a public policy viewpoint, some adverse selection can also be advantageous because it may lead to a higher fraction of total losses for the whole population being covered by insurance than if there were no adverse selection. <ref>{{cite journal |last=Thomas |first=R. G. |year=2008 |title=Loss coverage as a public policy objective for risk classification schemes |journal=Journal of Risk & Insurance |volume=75 |issue=4 |pages=997–1018 |doi=10.1111/j.1539-6975.2008.00294.x }}</ref> . 

In studies of health insurance, an [[individual mandate]] requiring people to either purchase plans or face a penalty is cited as a way out of the adverse selection problem by broadening the [[risk pool]]. <ref>{{cite journal |last=Blumberg |first=Linda J. |last2=Holahan |first2=John |title=The Individual Mandate — An Affordable and Fair Approach to Achieving Universal Coverage |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine|N Engl J Med]] |year=2009 |volume=361 |issue=1 |pages=6–7 |doi=10.1056/NEJMp0904729 }}</ref> Mandates, like all insurance, increase [[moral hazard]].  .
