The '''Budget of the United States Government''' is the [[President of the United States|President]]'s proposal to the [[U.S. Congress]] which recommends funding levels for the next [[fiscal year]], beginning October 1.  Congressional decisions are governed by rules and legislation regarding the [[United States budget process|federal budget process]].  Budget committees set spending limits for the House and Senate committees and for Appropriations subcommittees, which then approve individual [[appropriations bill]]s to allocate funding to various federal programs.  . 

After Congress approves an appropriations bill, it is sent to the President, who may sign it into law, or may veto it.  A vetoed bill is sent back to Congress, which can pass it into law with a two-thirds majority in each chamber.  Congress may also combine all or some appropriations bills into an omnibus reconciliation bill.  In addition, the president may request and the Congress may pass supplemental appropriations bills or emergency supplemental appropriations bills.  . 

Several government agencies provide budget data and analysis. These include the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO), [[Congressional Budget Office]], the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) and the [[U.S. Treasury Department]].  These agencies have reported that the federal government is facing a series of important financing challenges. In the short-run, tax revenues have declined significantly due to a severe [[recession]] and tax policy choices, while expenditures have expanded for wars, unemployment insurance and other safety net spending. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/09/opinion/09krugman.html?src=ISMR_AP_LO_MST_FB NYT-Krugman-The Unwisdom of Elites-May 2011]</ref><ref name="pewtrusts.org">[http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Fact_Sheets/Economic_Policy/drivers_federal_debt_since_2001.pdf Pew Charitable Trusts-The Great Debt Shift-April 2011]</ref> In the long-run, expenditures related to healthcare programs such as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] are projected to grow faster than the economy overall as the population matures. <ref>[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10840 Charlie Rose Show-Senators Bayh, Gregg and Roger Altman-February 1, 2010]</ref><ref>[http://www.cbpp.org/files/01-12-10bud.pdf Center on Budget and Policy Priorities-The Right Target: Stabilize the Federal Debt January 2010]</ref> . 

== Budget principles ==. 
The [[U.S. Constitution]] ([[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]], section 9, clause 7) states that "[n]o money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time." . 

Each year, the President of the United States submits his budget request to Congress for the following fiscal year as required by the [[Budget and Accounting Act of 1921]].  Current law ({{UnitedStatesCode|31|1105}}(a)) requires the president to submit a budget no earlier than the first Monday in January, and no later than the first Monday in February. Typically, presidents submit budgets on the first Monday in February. The budget submission has been delayed, however, in some new presidents' first year when previous president belonged to a different party.  . 

The federal budget is calculated largely on a cash basis.  That is, revenues and outlays are recognized when transactions are made.  Therefore, the full long-term costs of entitlement programs such as Medicare, Social Security, and the federal portion of Medicaid are not reflected in the federal budget.  By contrast, many businesses and some  other national governments have adopted forms of accrual accounting, which recognizes obligations and revenues when they are incurred.  The costs of some federal credit and loan programs, according to provisions of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, are calculated on a [[net present value]] basis. <ref>The Federal Credit Reform Act was passed as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-508)</ref> . 

Federal agencies cannot spend money unless funds are authorized and appropriated.  Typically, separate Congressional committees have jurisdiction over authorization and appropriations.  The House and Senate Appropriations Committees currently have 12 subcommittees, which are responsible for drafting the 12 regular appropriations bills that determine amounts of discretionary spending for various federal programs.  Appropriations bills must pass both the House and Senate and then be signed by the president in order to give federal agencies legal authority to spend. <ref>A bill can also be enacted by a Congressional override of a presidential veto, or is automatically enacted if the president takes no action within 10 days after receiving the bill. </ref>  In many recent years, regular appropriations bills have been combined into "omnibus" bills.  . 

Congress may also pass "special" or "emergency" appropriations.  Spending that is deemed an "emergency" is exempt from certain Congressional budget enforcement rules.  Funds for disaster relief have sometimes come from supplemental appropriations, such as after [[Hurricane Katrina]].  In other cases, funds included in emergency supplemental appropriations bills support activities not obviously related to actual emergencies, such as parts of the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 Census of Population and Housing]]. Special appropriations have been used to fund most of the costs of war and occupation in [[Iraq war|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] so far.  . 

Budget resolutions and appropriations bills, which reflect spending priorities of Congress, will usually differ from funding levels in the president's budget. The president, however, retains substantial influence over the budget process through his veto power and through his congressional allies when his party has a majority in Congress.  . 

The amount of budget authority and outlays for a fiscal year usually differ because budget authority from a previous fiscal year in some cases can be used for outlays in the current fiscal year.  Budget authority is the authority provided by federal law to enter into financial obligations that will result in immediate or future outlays involving federal government funds.  Outlays refer to the issuance of checks, disbursement of cash, or electronic transfer of funds made to liquidate a federal obligation, and is usually synonymous with "expenditure" or "spending."  The term "appropriations" refers to budget authority to incur obligations and to make payments from the Treasury for specified purposes.  Some military and some housing programs have multi-year appropriations, in which budget authority is specified for several coming fiscal years.  . 

===Federal budget data===. 
Several government agencies provide budget data. These include the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO), the [[Congressional Budget Office]], the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) and the [[U.S. Treasury Department]]. The CBO publishes ''The Budget and Economic Outlook'' in January, which is typically updated in August. It also publishes a ''Monthly Budget Review''. The OMB, which is responsible for organizing the President's budget presented in February, typically issues a budget update in July. The GAO and the Treasury issue ''Financial Statements of the U.S. Government'', usually in the December following the close of the federal fiscal year, which occurs September 30. There is a corresponding ''Citizen's Guide'', a short summary. The Treasury Department also produces a ''Combined Statement of Receipts, Outlays, and Balances'' each December for the preceding fiscal year, which provides detailed data on federal financial activities.  . 

{{Anchor| Historical Tables}}
Historical tables within the President's Budget (OMB) provide a wide range of data on federal government finances. Many of the data series begin in 1940 and include estimates of the President’s Budget for 2009–2014. Additionally, Table 1.1 provides data on receipts, outlays, and surpluses or deficits for 1901–1939 and for earlier multi-year periods. This document is composed of 17 sections, each of which has one or more tables. Each section covers a common theme. Section 1, for example, provides an overview of the budget and off-budget totals; Section 2 provides tables on receipts by source; and Section 3 shows outlays by function. When a section contains several tables, the general rule is to start with tables showing the broadest overview data and then work down to more detailed tables. The purpose of these tables is to present a broad range of historical budgetary data in one convenient reference source and to provide relevant comparisons likely to be most useful. The most common comparisons are in terms of proportions (e.g., each major receipt category as a percentage of total receipts and of the gross domestic product). <ref name="Historical Tables: Budget of the U.S. Government">[http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/hist.pdf Historical Tables: Budget of the U.S. Government]</ref> . 

===Federal budget projections===. 
The CBO calculates 35-year baseline projections, which are used extensively in the budget process.  Baseline projections are intended to reflect spending under current law, and are not intended as predictions of the most likely path of the economy. During the George W. Bush Administration, the OMB presented five-year projections, but presented 45-year projections in the FY2010 budget submission. The CBO and the GAO issue long-term projections from time to time.  . 

==Major receipt categories==. 
{{main|Taxation in the United States}} . 

During FY 2011, the federal government collected approximately $2.3 trillion in tax revenue or 15.4% GDP. Primary receipt categories included individual income taxes (47%), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes (36%), and corporate taxes (8%). <ref name="CBO Historical Tables">[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12039/HistoricalTables%5B1%5D.pdf CBO Historical Tables]</ref> Other types included excise, estate and gift taxes.  . 

Tax revenues have averaged approximately 18.3% of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) over the 1970-2009 period, generally ranging plus or minus 2% from that level. Tax revenues are significantly affected by the economy. Recessions typically reduce government tax collections as economic activity slows. For example, tax revenues declined from $2.5 trillion in 2008 to $2.1 trillion in 2009, and remained at that level in 2010. During 2009, individual income taxes declined 20%, while corporate taxes declined 50%. At 15.1% of GDP, the 2009 and 2010 collections were the lowest level of the past 50 years. <ref name="CBO Historical Tables"/><ref>[http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/31/are-taxes-in-the-u-s-high-or-low/NYT-Bruce Bartlett-Are Taxes in the U.S. High or Low?-May 2011]</ref> .

====Tax descriptions====. 
The federal personal income tax is [[progressive tax|progressive]], meaning a higher marginal tax rate is applied to higher ranges of income. For example, in 2010 the tax rate that applied to the first $17,000 in taxable income for a couple filing jointly was 10%, while the rate applied to income over $379,150 was 35%. The top marginal tax rate has declined considerably since 1980. For example, the top tax rate was lowered from 70% to 50% in 1980 and reached as low as 28% in 1988. The most recent changes were the [[Bush tax cuts]] of 2001 and 2003, extended by President Obama in 2010, which lowered the top rate from 39.6% to 35%. <ref name="taxfoundation.org">[http://www.taxfoundation.org/publications/show/151.html Tax Foundation-Historical Tax Rates-Retrieved July 2011]</ref> There are numerous exemptions and deductions, that typically result in a range of 35-40% of U.S. households owing no federal income tax. The recession and tax cut stimulus measures increased this to 51% for 2009, versus 38% in 2007. <ref>[http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&id=3505 CBPP-Misconceptions and Realities About Who Pays Taxes-March 2011]</ref> . 

The federal payroll tax ([[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|FICA]]) is a [[flat tax]] used to fund Social Security and Medicare. For the Social Security portion, employers and employees each pay 6.2% of the workers gross pay, a total of 12.4%. The Social Security portion is capped at $106,800, meaning income above this amount is not subject to the tax. The Medicare portion is also paid by employer and employee each at 1.45% and is not capped. <ref>U.S. Social Security Administration, at [http://ssa-custhelp.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/ssa.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=240&p_created=956850562&p_sid=mn*Ildkj&p_accessibility=0&p_redirect=&p_lva=&p_sp=cF9zcmNoPSZwX3NvcnRfYnk9JnBfZ3JpZHNvcnQ9JnBfcm93X2NudD0zMCwzMCZwX3Byb2RzPSZwX2NhdHM9OSZwX3B2PSZwX2N2PTEuOSZwX3NlYXJjaF90eXBlPWFuc3dlcnMuc2VhcmNoX25sJnBfcGFnZT0x&p_li=&p_topview=1]. </ref> The payroll tax is considered by some to be a form of social insurance rather than a tax, due to the benefits these programs pay to qualified recipients. For calendar year 2011, the employee's portion of the payroll tax was reduced to 4.2% as an economic stimulus measure. <ref name=2011Pub15>[http://www.irs.gov/publications/p15/ar02.html IRS Publication 15 (2011)]</ref> . 

====Tax expenditures====. 
The term "tax expenditures" refers to income exemptions or deductions that reduce the tax collections that would be made applying a particular tax rate alone. According to the [[Center for American Progress]], annual tax expenditures have increased from $526 billion in 1982 to $1,025 billion in 2010, adjusted for inflation (measured in 2010 dollars). <ref>[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/06/low_tax.html Center for American Progress-Ten Charts that Prove the U.S. is a Low Tax Country-June 2011]</ref> Economist [[Mark Zandi]] wrote in July 2011 that tax expenditures should be considered a form of government spending. <ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/moodys-economist-mark-zandi-how-to-cut-the-deficit--and-the-trouble-if-we-dont/2011/07/14/gIQAKmX8FI_story.html Washington Post-Mark Zandi-How to Cut the Deficit, and What Happens if We Don't-July 2011]</ref> . 

In November 2009, ''[[The Economist]]'' estimated the additional federal tax revenue generated from eliminating certain tax expenditures, for the 2013-2014 period. These included: income exemptions for employer-provided health insurance ($215 billion); and various income deductions such as mortgage interest ($147B), state & local taxes ($65B), capital gains on homes ($60B), property taxes ($33B) and municipal bond interest ($37B). These total $557 billion. All of these steps together would reduce the projected deficit at that time by nearly half. <ref>[http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14903024 The Economist-Stemming the Tide-November 2009]</ref> . 

The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated in 2008 the amount of federal tax expenditures for the five year (2008–2012) period. Examples include: Exclusions for healthcare insurance paid for by employers-$680B; reduced tax rate on dividends and long-term capital gains-$668B; deduction for mortgage interest on owner-occupied residences-$444B; exclusions for pre-tax defined benefit or defined contribution pension contributions such as to 401K plans-$554B; deductions for non-business state and local income taxes-$242B; deductions for charitable contributions-$205B; exclusion of benefits under healthcare insurance "cafeteria" plans-$201B; exclusion for interest on state and local government bonds-$147B; exclusion for Medicare benefits-$134B; deduction for real property taxes-$112B; dependent credit for children under 17 years of age-$105B; exclusion for capital gains on sale of primary residence-$90B; and deductions for long-term care and other medical expenses-$68B. <ref>[http://www.jct.gov/s-2-08.pdf Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation-Estimates of Federal Tax Expenditures for Fiscal Years 2008-2012]</ref> . 

==Major expenditure categories== . 

{{main|Expenditures in the United States federal budget}} . 

During FY 2011, the federal government spent $3.60 trillion on a budget or cash basis, up 4% vs. FY 2010 spending of $3.46 trillion and up 20% versus FY2008 spend of $2.97 trillion. Major categories of FY 2011 spending included: Medicare & Medicaid ($835B or 24%), Social Security ($725B or 20%), Defense Department ($700B or 19%), non-defense discretionary ($646B or 19%), other ($465B or 12%) and interest ($227B or 6%). Expenditures are classified as mandatory, with payments required by specific laws, or discretionary, with payment amounts renewed annually as part of the budget process. Expenditures averaged 20.6% GDP from 1971 to 2008, generally ranging +/-2% GDP from that level. The 2011 and 2010 spend were both 24.1% GDP, versus 2008 spend of 20.8% GDP. <ref name="CBO Historical Tables"/> . 

===Mandatory spending and entitlements===. 
[[File:Social Security Worker to Beneficiary Ratio.png|thumb|300px|right|Social Security - Ratio of Covered Workers to Retirees]]
[[Image:GAO Slide.png|thumb|300px|right|Entitlement Spending Risks]] . 

[[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], and [[Medicaid]] expenditures are funded by permanent appropriations and so are considered mandatory spending.  Social Security and Medicare are sometimes called "entitlements," because people meeting relevant eligibility requirements are legally entitled to benefits, although most pay taxes into these programs throughout their working lives. Some programs, such as Food Stamps, are appropriated entitlements. Some mandatory spending, such as Congressional salaries, is not part of any entitlement program.  Mandatory spending accounted for 53% of total federal outlays in FY2008, with net interest payments accounting for an additional 8.5%. <ref>U.S. Congressional Budget Office, An Analysis of the President's Budgetary Proposals for Fiscal Year 2010, June 2009. </ref> . 

Mandatory spending is expected to increase as a share of GDP.  This is due in part to demographic trends, as the number of workers continues declining relative to those receiving benefits. For example, the number of workers per retiree was 5.1 in 1960; this declined to 3.0 in 2010 and is projected to decline to 2.2 by 2030. <ref>[http://www.concordcoalition.org/files/uploaded_for_nodes/080626-concord-chart-talk.ppt Concord Slides]</ref><ref>[http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2010/lr4b2.html Social Security Trustees Report 2010-Table IV.B2]</ref> These programs are also affected by per-person costs, which are also expected to increase at a rate significantly higher than the economy. This unfavorable combination of demographics and per-capita rate increases is expected to drive both Social Security and Medicare into large deficits during the 21st century.  Unless these long-term fiscal imbalances are addressed by reforms to these programs, raising taxes or drastic cuts in discretionary programs, the federal government will at some point be unable to pay its obligations without significant risk to the value of the dollar (inflation). <ref>[http://www.gao.gov/financial/citizensguide2008.pdf GAO Citizens Guide<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lynn-parramore/the-deficit-nine-myths-we_b_553527.html Huffington Post-Lynn Parramore-Nine Deficit Myths We Cannot Afford-April 2010]</ref> . 

* '''Medicare''' was established in 1965 and expanded thereafter. In 2009, the program covered an estimated 45 million persons (38 million aged and 7 million disabled). It consists of four distinct parts which are funded differently: Hospital Insurance, mainly funded by a dedicated payroll tax of 2.9% of earnings, shared equally between employers and workers; Supplementary Medical Insurance, funded through beneficiary premiums (set at 25% of estimated program costs for the aged) and general revenues (the remaining amount, approximately 75%); [[Medicare Advantage]], a private plan option for beneficiaries, funded through the Hospital Insurance and Supplementary Medical Insurance trust funds; and the "[[Medicare Part D|Part D]]" prescription drug benefits, for which funding is included in the Supplementary Medical Insurance trust fund and is financed through beneficiary premiums (about 25%) and general revenues (about 75%). <ref>[http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/R40425_20090310.pdf Congressional Research Service-Medicare Primer-March 2009]</ref>  Spending on Medicare and Medicaid is projected to grow dramatically in coming decades. The number of persons enrolled in Medicare is expected to increase from 47 million in 2010 to 80 million by 2030. <ref name="economist1">[http://www.economist.com/node/17800237 The Economist-As Boomers Wrinkle-December 2010]</ref> While the same demographic trends that affect Social Security also affect Medicare, rapidly rising medical prices appear to be a more important cause of projected spending increases. CBO expects Medicare and Medicaid to continue growing, rising from 5.3% GDP in 2009 to 10.0% in 2035 and 19.0% by 2082. CBO has indicated healthcare spending per beneficiary is the primary long-term fiscal challenge. <ref name="autogenerated2">[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/115xx/doc11579/06-30-LTBO.pdf CBO Long Term Budget Outlook - June and August 2010]</ref> Various [[Health care reform in the United States|reform strategies]] were proposed for healthcare,<ref>[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/06/01/090601fa_fact_gawande Atul Gawande-The New Yorker-The Cost Conundrum-June 2009]</ref>  and in March 2010, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] was enacted as a means of [[Health care reform in the United States|health care reform]]. 
* '''Social Security''' is a [[Social Security (United States)|social insurance]] program officially called "Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance" (OASDI), in reference to its three components. It is primarily funded through a dedicated payroll tax of 12.4%. During 2010, total benefits of $713 billion were paid out versus income (taxes and interest) of $781 billion, a $68 billion surplus. An estimated 157 million people paid into the program and 54 million received benefits, roughly 2.91 workers per beneficiary. <ref>[http://www.ssa.gov/pressoffice/pr/trustee11-pr.htm 2010 Social Security Trustees Report Summary Press Release]</ref>  Since the [[Greenspan Commission]] in the early 1980s, Social Security has cumulatively collected far more in payroll taxes dedicated to the program than it has paid out to recipients&mdash;nearly $2.6 trillion in 2010. This annual surplus is credited to Social Security trust funds that hold special non-marketable Treasury securities. This surplus amount is commonly referred to as the "[[Social Security Trust Fund]]".  The proceeds are paid into the U.S. Treasury where they may be used for other government purposes.  Social Security spending will increase sharply over the next decades, largely due to the retirement of the baby boom generation. The number of program recipients is expected to increase from 44 million in 2010 to 73 million in 2030. <ref name="economist1"/> Program spending is projected to rise from 4.8% of GDP in 2010 to 5.9% of GDP by 2030, where it will stabilize. <ref>[http://www.heritage.org/budgetchartbook/entitlement-spending-double Heritage Foundation-Book of Charts-As of November 2010]</ref> The Social Security Administration projects that an increase in payroll taxes equivalent to 1.8% of the payroll tax base or 0.6% of GDP would be necessary to put the Social Security program in fiscal balance for the next 75 years. Over an infinite time horizon, these shortfalls average 3.3% of the payroll tax base and 1.2% of GDP. <ref>[http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/TR/2010/IV_LRest.html#239829 Trustees Report Long Range Estimates - Section 5a Table IV.B6]</ref> Various reforms have been [[Social Security debate (United States)|debated]] for Social Security. Examples include reducing future annual cost of living adjustments (COLA) provided to recipients, raising the retirement age, and raising the income limit subject to the payroll tax ($106,800 in 2009). <ref>[http://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/econ/i3_reform.pdf AARP Public Policy Institute-Reform Options for Social Security]</ref><ref>[http://www.usnews.com/money/blogs/planning-to-retire/2010/5/18/12-ways-to-fix-social-security.html U.S. News and World Report-12 Ways to Fix Social Security-May 2010]</ref> Because of the mandatory nature of the program and large accumulated surplus in the Social Security Trust Fund, the Social Security system has the legal authority to compel the government to borrow to pay all promised benefits through 2036, when the Trust Fund is expected to be exhausted. Thereafter, the program under current law will pay approximately 75%-78% of promised benefits for the remainder of the century. <ref>{{Citation| last = Lew| first = Jacob| author-link = Jacob Lew  | title = Opposing view: Social Security isn't the problem| newspaper = [[USA Today]]| date = February 21, 2011| url = http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2011-02-22-editorial22_ST1_N.htm| accessdate = 2011-03-14}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ssa.gov/pressoffice/pr/trustee11-pr.htm 2010 Social Security Trustees Report Summary Press Release]</ref> .

[[File:Discretionary Spending by Dpt - 2010E.png|thumb|right|300px|FY 2010 Estimated Federal Spending per 2011 Budget]] . 

* '''Military spending''':  The [[military budget of the United States]] during FY 2011 was approximately $740 billion in expenses for the Department of Defense (DoD), $141 billion for veteran expenses, and $48 billion in expenses for the Department of Homeland Security, for a total of $929 billion. <ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2012/assets/hist03z2.xls OMB Fiscal Year 2012 Budget - Historical Tables, Table 3.2]</ref>  The U.S. defense budget (excluding spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Homeland Security, and Veteran's Affairs) is around 5% of GDP. Adding these other costs places defense spending between 6% and 7% of GDP.  The DoD baseline budget, excluding supplemental funding for the wars, has grown from $297 billion in FY2001 to a budgeted $534 billion for FY2010, an 81% increase. <ref>[http://www.defense.gov/news/FY10%20Budget%20Request.pdf DOD - Defense Trend Spending Chart - May 7, 2009]</ref> According to the CBO, defense spending grew 9% annually on average from fiscal year 2000-2009. <ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/106xx/doc10640/10-2009-MBR.pdf CBO-Monthly Budget Review-Sept 09]</ref>  Much of the costs for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have not been funded through regular appropriations bills, but through emergency supplemental appropriations bills. As such, most of these expenses were not included in the budget deficit calculation prior to FY2010. Some budget experts argue that emergency supplemental appropriations bills do not receive the same level of legislative care as regular appropriations bills. <ref>Anthony Cordesman and Erin Fitzgerald, Resourcing for Defeat, Center for Strategic and International Studies, 2009 http://csis.org/publication/resourcing-defeat-0</ref>
* '''Non-defense discretionary spending''' is used to fund the [[United States federal executive departments|executive departments]] (e.g., the Department of Education) and [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agencies]] (e.g., the Environmental Protection Agency), although these do receive a smaller amount of mandatory funding as well. Discretionary budget authority is established annually by Congress, as opposed to mandatory spending that is required by laws that span multiple years, such as Social Security or Medicare.  The federal government spent approximately $660 billion during 2010 on the Cabinet Departments and Agencies, excluding the Department of Defense, representing 19% of budgeted expenditures<ref name="CBO Historical Tables"/> or about 4.5% of GDP.  Several politicians and think tanks have proposed freezing non-defense discretionary spending at particular levels and holding this spending constant for various periods of time. President Obama proposed freezing discretionary spending representing approximately 12% of the budget in his 2011 State of the Union address. <ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/state-of-the-union-2011 State of the Union Speech-January 2011]</ref>
* '''Interest expense''': Budgeted net interest on the public debt was approximately $251 billion in FY2011 (6% of spending). During FY2011, the government also accrued a non-cash interest expense of $203 billion for intra-governmental debt, primarily the Social Security Trust Fund, for a total interest expense of $454 billion. <ref>[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/feddebt/feddebt_ann2011.pdf GAO Audit Report on Treasury Debt - FY2011]</ref>  Net interest costs paid on the public debt increased from $215 billion in 2010 due to higher debt levels.  Should interest rates rise to historical averages, the interest cost would increase dramatically. Historian [[Niall Ferguson]] described the risk that foreign investors would demand higher interest rates as the U.S. debt levels increase over time in a November 2009 interview. <ref>[http://www.charlierose.com/ Charlie Rose Interview-Niall Ferguson-November 3, 2009]</ref>  As of January 2012, public debt owned by foreigners has increased to approximately 50% of the total or approximately $5.0 trillion. <ref>[http://www.treas.gov/tic/mfh.txt Treasury-Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities]</ref> As a result, nearly 50% of the interest payments are now leaving the country, which is different from past years when interest was paid to U.S. citizens holding the public debt. Interest expenses are projected to grow dramatically as the U.S. debt increases and interest rates rise from very low levels in 2009 to more typical historical levels.  .

{{Main|United States public debt}} . 

The annual budget deficit is the difference between actual cash collections and budgeted spending (a partial measure of total spending) during a given fiscal year, which runs from October 1 to September 30. Since 1970, the U.S. federal government has run deficits for all but four years (1998–2001)<ref>Bittle, Scott & Johnson, Jean. "Where Does Money Go?" Collins; New York: 2008. </ref> contributing to a total debt of $15.35 trillion as of January 2012. <ref>[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/mspd/2012/opds012012.pdf Treasury Direct-Monthly Statement of the Public Debt - January 2012]</ref> The fiscal year 2011 "total budget" deficit was $1.296 trillion or 8.7% GDP, similar to the $1.294 trillion or 9.0% GDP in 2010. These deficits are considerably higher than [[Subprime mortgage crisis|pre-crisis]] levels, which ranged from a $236 billion (2.4% GDP) surplus in 2000 to a $459 billion (3.2% GDP) deficit in 2008. <ref name="CBO Historical Tables"/> . 

The national debt increase during a given year is not the same as the "total budget" deficit commonly reported, due to a variety of accounting complexities involved. These differences can make it more challenging to determine how much the government actually spends relative to tax revenues. The increase in the national debt during a given year is a helpful measure to determine this amount. From FY 2003-2007, the national debt increased approximately $550 billion per year on average. For the first time in FY 2008, the U.S. added $1 trillion to the national debt as the effects of a severe [[Subprime mortgage crisis|global financial crisis]] became apparent. Debt increases rose to $1.88 trillion in 2009 and $1.65 trillion in 2010 as the crisis continued. <ref>[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt.htm U.S. Treasury Direct]</ref> In relative terms, from 2003-2007 the government spent roughly $1.20 for each $1.00 it collected in taxes. This increased to $1.40 in FY2008 and $1.90 in FY2009.  . 

The total federal debt is divided into "debt held by the public" and "intra-governmental debt." The debt held by the public refers to U.S. government securities or other obligations held by investors (e.g., bonds, bills and notes), while Social Security and other federal trust funds are part of the intra-governmental debt. As of January 31, 2012 the total debt was $15.4 trillion, with debt held by the public of $10.6 trillion and intragovernmental debt of $4.8 trillion. <ref>[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/mspd/2012/opds012012.pdf Treasury Direct-Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States-January 2012]</ref> Debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP rose from 34.7% in 2000 to 40.3% in 2008 and 62.1% in 2010. <ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12039/HistoricalTables%5B1%5D.pdf CBO Historical Tables - January 2011]</ref> U.S. GDP was approximately $14.5 trillion during 2010 and an estimated $15 trillion for 2011 based on activity during the first two quarters. <ref>[http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/2011/pdf/gdp2q11_2nd.pdf BEA-GDP News Release August 2011-Table 3]</ref> This means the total debt is roughly the size of GDP.  Economists debate the level of debt relative to GDP that signals a "red line" or dangerous level, or if any such level exists. <ref>Bernanke, Ben S. (April 27, 2010).

The CBO reported several types of risk factors related to rising debt levels in a July 2010 publication:
*A growing portion of savings would go towards purchases of government debt, rather than investments in productive capital goods such as factories and computers, leading to lower output and incomes than would otherwise occur;
*If higher marginal tax rates were used to pay rising interest costs, savings would be reduced and work would be discouraged;
*Rising interest costs would force reductions in important government programs;
*Restrictions to the ability of policymakers to use fiscal policy to respond to economic challenges; and
*An increased risk of a sudden fiscal crisis, in which investors demand higher interest rates. <ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=11659 Congressional Budget Office-"Federal Debt and the Risk of a Fiscal Crisis"-July 2010]</ref> . 

===CBO scenarios===. 
[[File:CBO - Public Debt Scenarios - June 2011.png|thumb|350px|right|CBO-Public Debt Under "Extended" and "Alternate" Scenarios]]
The CBO reported during June 2011 two scenarios for how debt held by the public will change during the 2010-2035 time period. The "extended baseline scenario" assumes that the [[Bush tax cuts]] (extended by Obama) will expire per current law in 2012. It also assumes the alternative minimum tax (AMT) will be allowed to affect more middle-class families, reductions in Medicare reimbursement rates to doctors will occur, and that revenues reach 23% GDP by 2035, much higher than the historical average 18%. Under this scenario, activities such as national defense and a wide variety of domestic programs (excluding Social Security, Medicare, and interest) would decline to the lowest percentage of GDP since before World War II. Under this scenario, public debt rises from 69% GDP in 2011 to 84% by 2035, with interest payments absorbing 4% of GDP vs. 1% in 2011. <ref name="cbo.gov">[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/122xx/doc12212/2011_06_22_summary.pdf CBO 2011 Long-Term Budget Outlook-June 2011]</ref> . 

CBO estimated in August 2011 that if laws currently "on the books" were enforced without changes, meaning the "extended baseline scenario" described above is implemented along with deficit reductions from the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]], the deficit would decline from 8.5% GDP in 2011 to around 1% GDP by 2021. <ref name="ReferenceC">[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/123xx/doc12316/Update_SummaryforWeb.pdf CBO-The Budget and Economic Outlook-August 2011]</ref><ref name="washingtonpost.com">[http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/post/why-doing-nothing-yields-71-trillion-in-deficit-cuts/2011/11/16/gIQAsOdwRN_blog.html Washington Post-EJ Dionne-Why Doing Nothing Yields $7.1 trillion in deficit cuts-November 16, 2011]</ref> . 

The "alternative fiscal scenario" more closely assumes the continuation of present trends, such as permanently extending the Bush tax cuts, restricting the reach of the AMT, and keeping Medicare reimbursement rates at the current level (the so-called "[[doc fix]]", versus declining by one-third as mandated under current law). Revenues are assumed to remain around the historical average 18% GDP. Under this scenario, public debt rises from 69% GDP in 2011 to 100% by 2021 and approaches 190% by 2035. <ref name="cbo.gov"/> . 

The CBO reported in June 2011: "Many budget analysts believe that the alternative fiscal scenario presents a more realistic picture of the nation’s underlying fiscal policies than the extended-baseline scenario does. The explosive path of federal debt under the alternative fiscal scenario underscores the need for large and rapid policy changes to put the nation on a sustainable fiscal course."<ref name="cbo.gov"/> . 

CBO reported in September 2011: "The nation cannot continue to sustain the spending programs and policies of the past with the tax revenues it has been accustomed to paying. Citizens will either have to pay more for their government, accept less in government services and benefits, or both."<ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=12413 CBO Testimony-Confronting the Nation's Fiscal Policy Challenges-September 2011]</ref> . 

==Contemporary issues and debates==. 
[[File:CBO Budget Deficit Assuming Continuation of Policies.png|350px|right|U.S. Federal budget deficit as % GDP assuming continuation of certain policies 2011-2021]]
{{Main|Political debates about the United States federal budget}}
{{See also|Social Security debate in the United States|Health care reform debate in the United States}} . 

Topics frequently in the news in the 2010-2011 time period included: a) the effect of the [[Bush tax cuts]] and related extension; b) causes of deficit and debt increases; c) the effects of fraud, waste and earmarks; d) whether a "danger level" of debt exists; and e) the effects of globalization and free trade on employment,<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html?_r=1 NYT-Apple and a Squeezed Middle Class-Jan 2012]</ref> among others.   . 

Many of the debates surrounding the United States federal budget center around competing [[macroeconomic]] schools of thought. In general, Democrats favor the principles of [[Keynesian economics]] to encourage economic growth via a [[mixed economy]] of both private and public enterprise, a [[welfare state]], and strong regulatory oversight. Conversely, Republicans generally support applying the principles of either ''[[laissez-faire]]'' or [[supply-side economics]] to grow the economy via small government, low taxes, limited regulation, and [[free enterprise]]. <ref>{{cite web | url=ttp://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/07/20/presidents-and-their-debts-fdr-to-bush/presidential-pleasure-principles | title=Presidents and Their Debts, F.D.R. to Bush | first=Alonzo | last=Hamby | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=2011-07-29 | accessdate=2011-08-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/node/18560739 | title=The rise of the anti-Keynesians | publisher=[[The Economist]] | date=2011-04-14 | accessdate=2011-08-16}}</ref> Debates have surrounded the appropriate size and role of the federal government since the founding of the country.  These debates also deal with questions of morality, [[Economic egalitarianism|income equality]] and [[intergenerational equity]]. For example, Congress adding to the debt today may or may not enhance the quality of life for future generations, who must also bear the additional interest and taxation burden. <ref>[http://www.pgpf.org/Special-Topics/Download-the-Citizens-Guide.aspx Peter G. Peterson Foundation-Citizen's Guide 2010]</ref> . 

Economic growth and employment are key factors driving recent deficits. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimated in October 2011 that approximately one-third of the deficit projected for fiscal year 2012 is due to economic factors, which have caused safety net expenditures to increase and tax revenues to decline with high unemployment. <ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/124xx/doc12440/10-04-Portion_of_Deficit_Due_to_Cyclical_Weakness.pdf CBO Letter to Congressman Van Hollen-October 4, 2011]</ref> . 

The U.S. last balanced its budget in 2001. Between 2001 and 2010, spending increased by 5.6% GDP (from 18.2% GDP in 2001 to 23.8% GDP in 2010), while revenues declined by 4.6% GDP (from 19.5% GDP in 2001 to 14.9% GDP in 2010), resulting in a 9.4% GDP deficit. Medicare/Medicaid spending increased by 1.9% GDP and defense spending increased by 1.7% GDP. Individual income tax revenues fell by 3.5% GDP and payroll taxes fell by 0.8% GDP. <ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12039/HistoricalTables%5B1%5D.pdf CBO Historical Tables-1971 to 2010]</ref><ref>[http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/Fiscal_Analysis/Essential_Federal_Fiscal_Charts.pdf Pew Trusts-10 Key Budget Charts-2011]</ref> . 

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] summarized these causes in May 2011: "What happened to the budget surplus the federal government had in 2000? The answer is, three main things. First, there were the Bush tax cuts, which added roughly $2 trillion to the national debt over the last decade. Second, there were the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which added an additional $1.1 trillion or so. And third was the Great Recession, which led both to a collapse in revenue and to a sharp rise in spending on unemployment insurance and other safety-net programs."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/09/opinion/09krugman.html?src=ISMR_AP_LO_MST_FB NYT-Paul Krugman-The Unwisdom of Elites-May 2011]</ref> . 

CBO has estimated that letting current laws take effect would significantly reduce future budget deficits. For example, the [[Bush tax cuts]] of 2001 and 2003 (extended by President Obama in 2009) are scheduled to expire at the end of 2012. Other deficit reducers per CBO include allowing other tax cuts enacted in 2009 and 2010 by President Obama to expire in 2012, allowing the alternative minimum tax (AMT) to affect more taxpayers, and reducing Medicare reimbursements to doctors. These and other current laws, if allowed to take effect, reduce the deficit from an estimated 4.7% GDP in 2021 to 1.2% GDP. <ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/123xx/doc12316/OutlookGraphics.pdf CBO-Long Term Budget Outlook Graphics-August 2012]</ref> Total deficit reduction could be as high as $7.1 trillion over a decade if current law is enforced and not overridden. <ref name="washingtonpost.com"/> .

===Strategies===. 
Strategies for addressing the deficit problem may include policy choices regarding taxation and spending, along with policies designed to increase economic growth and reduce unemployment. These policy decisions may be evaluated in the context of a framework:<ref name="Bittle 2011">{{cite book
| last = Bittle
| first = Scott
| year = 2011
| title = Where Does the Money Go? | publisher = Harper
| isbn = 978-0-06-124187-1}}</ref> . 

*Promote economic growth and employment: A fast-growing economy offers the [[Win-win game|win-win]] outcome of a larger proverbial economic pie to divide, with higher employment and tax revenues, lower safety net spending and a lower debt-to-GDP ratio. 
*Make equitable trade-offs: Many budget choices have [[Zero sum game|win-lose]] outcomes, reflecting how government revenues are divided, with some benefiting and others incurring costs. For example, taking away benefits from those in or near retirement may be considered inequitable, while phasing out retirement benefits for younger workers may be considered less so. 
*Keep short- and long-term issues in perspective: Healthcare cost inflation and an aging population are the primary long-term deficit drivers. Unemployment and various tax and spending policy choices are the primary short-term deficit drivers. Measures to encourage economic growth today can be implemented along with other measures to reduce future deficits. <ref>[http://www.brookings.edu/testimony/2009/0127_budget_rivlin.aspx Alice M. Rivlin Congressional Testimony-January 2009]</ref>
*Limit or avoid future spending increases: Policy choices may focus on preventing future increases via freezes or reducing annual rates of increase, as federal spending has not declined year-over-year in nominal dollars since at least 1970. Annual growth rates since 2001 in the top three expenditure categories (Healthcare, Social Security, and Defense) are far above the economic growth rate. 
*Invest productively: Some spending can be categorized as investments that lower future deficits. For example, if infrastructure, education or R&D investments could make U.S. workers and products more competitive or generate a revenue stream, these could reduce future deficits. Examples might include installing windows that reduce energy costs, toll roads and bridges, or power plants. <ref name="Bittle 2011" />
*Avoid uncertainty and unnecessary regulation: Complex legislation may create uncertainty regarding future costs of doing business, which affects investment decisions made by businesses and households. <ref>[http://www.chamberpost.com/2011/08/another-%E2%80%9Cpivot%E2%80%9D-back-to-jobs/ U.S. Chamber of Commerce-Another Pivot Back to Jobs-Retrieved September 2011]</ref>
*Implement budget process reforms: Budget rules could be implemented that require new legislation or programs to be funded by either cutting other spending or raising taxes (i.e., "Pay as you go" or [[PAYGO]] rules.)<ref name="gao.gov">[http://www.gao.gov/cghome/d08446cg.pdf GAO-U.S. Financial Condition and Fiscal Future Briefing-David Walker-January 2008]</ref> . 

The CBO reported in September 2011 that: "Given the aging of the population and rising costs for health care, attaining a sustainable federal budget will require the United States to deviate from the policies of the past 40 years in at least one of the following ways:
*Raise federal revenues significantly above their average share of GDP;
*Make major changes to the sorts of benefits provided for Americans when they become older; or
*Substantially reduce the role of the rest of the federal government relative to the size of the economy."<ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/124xx/doc12419/CBO_Presentation_to_Macroeconomic_Advisers_9-14-11_Final.pdf CBO CBO-Presentation to Macroeconomic Advisers-September 2011]</ref> . 

During testimony before the Congressional Joint Deficit Reduction Committee in September 2011, CBO Director [[Douglas Elmendorf]] counseled members of Congress to make decisions about the role of the federal government, then make policy choices to obtain the revenue necessary to fund those roles, to put the U.S. on a sustainable fiscal path. <ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=12413 CBO-Confronting the Nation's Fiscal Policy Challenges-September 2011]</ref> . 

===Specific proposals===. 
A variety of government task forces, expert panels, private institutions, politicians, and journalists have made recommendations for addressing the deficit and debt: . 

*President Obama established a budget reform commission, the [[National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform]], which released a draft report in December 2010. It included various tax and spend adjustments to bring long-run government tax revenue and spending into line at approximately 21% of GDP, with $4 trillion debt avoidance over 10 years. <ref>[http://www.fiscalcommission.gov/sites/fiscalcommission.gov/files/documents/TheMomentofTruth12_1_2010.pdf Fiscal Commission-Final Report-December 2010]</ref> . 

*President Obama announced a 10-year (2012–2021) plan in September 2011 called: "Living Within Our Means and Investing in the Future: The President’s Plan for Economic Growth and Deficit Reduction." The plan included tax increases on the wealthy, along with cuts in future spending on defense and Medicare. Social Security was excluded from the plan. The plan included a net debt avoidance of $3.2 trillion over 10 years. If the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]] is included, this adds another $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction for a total of $4.4 trillion. <ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2012/assets/jointcommitteereport.pdf OMB-President Obama-Living within our Means and Investing in Our Future-September 2011-Table S-1]</ref> . 

*The House of Representatives Committee on the Budget, chaired by Rep. [[Paul Ryan (politician)|Paul Ryan]] (R), released [[The Path to Prosperity|''The Path to Prosperity: Restoring America's Promise'']]. The ''Path'' focuses on tax reform (lowering income tax rates and reducing tax expenditures or loopholes); spending cuts and controls; and redesign of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. It does not propose significant changes to Social Security. <ref>[http://budget.house.gov/fy2012budget/ House of Representatives-Committee on the Budget-Retrieved April 2011]</ref> . 

*The Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) proposed "The People's Budget" in April 2011, which it claimed would balance the budget by 2021 while maintaining debt as a % GDP under 65%. It proposed reversing most of the Bush tax cuts; higher income tax rates on the wealthy and restoring the estate tax, investing in a jobs program, and reducing defense spending. <ref>[http://grijalva.house.gov/uploads/The%20CPC%20FY2012%20Budget.pdf CPC-The People's Budget-April 2011]</ref> . 

*The Peter G. Peterson Foundation solicited proposals from six organizations, which included the American Enterprise Institute, the [[Bipartisan Policy Center]], the Center for American Progress, the Economic Policy Institute, The Heritage Foundation, and the Roosevelt Institute Campus Network. The recommendations of each group were reported in May 2011. <ref name="PGPF-Solutions Summit-May 2011">[http://pgpf.org/Issues/Fiscal-Outlook/2011/01/20/PGPF-Announces-Grants-to-Six-Institutions-to-Develop-Solutions-to-Americas-Fiscal-Challenges.aspx PGPF-Solutions Summit-May 2011]</ref> . 

*The [[Bipartisan Policy Center]] sponsored a Debt Reduction Task Force, co-chaired by [[Pete V. Domenici]] and [[Alice M. Rivlin]]. This panel created a report called "Restoring America's Future," which was published in November 2010. The plan claimed to stabilize the debt to GDP ratio at 60%, with up to $6 trillion in debt avoidance over the 2011-2020 period. Specific plan elements included defense and non-defense spending freezes for 4–5 years, income tax reform, elimination of tax expenditures, and a national sales tax or [[value-added tax]] (VAT). <ref>[http://www.bipartisanpolicy.org/projects/debt-initiative/about Bipartisan Policy Center Domenici-Rivlin Debt Reduction Task Force-]</ref><ref>[http://money.cnn.com/2010/11/17/news/economy/debt_commission_rivlin_domenici/index.htm CNN-Jeanne Sahadi-New Deficit Plan Would Cut $6 trillion-November 2010]</ref> . 

===Timing of solutions===. 
How urgently should the U.S. put plans in place to address its budget challenges? Fed Chair [[Ben Bernanke]] stated in January 2007: "The longer we wait, the more severe, the more draconian, the more difficult the objectives are going to be. I think the right time to start was about 10 years ago."<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16688089/ns/business-stocks_and_economy/t/bernanke-warns-vicious-cycle-deficits/ MSNBC-Bernanke Warns of Vicious Cycle in Deficits-January 18, 2007]</ref> .

The President's budget also contains revenue and spending projections for the current fiscal year, the coming fiscal years, as well as several future fiscal years.  In recent years, the President's budget contained projections five years into the future.  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issues a "Budget and Economic Outlook" each January and an analysis of the President's budget each March.  CBO also issues an updated budget and economic outlook in August.  .
