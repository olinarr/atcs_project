{{Public Infrastructure}}
The creation of a '''National Infrastructure Reinvestment Bank''' was first proposed by [[United States]] Senator [[Christopher J. Dodd]] and Senator [[Chuck Hagel]] in 2007. However, several other iterations of a National Infrastructure Bank have been proposed and considered<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newamerica.net/pressroom/2008/financing_america_s_infrastructure |title=Financing Americaâ€™s Infrastructure |publisher=New America Foundation |date=June 9, 2008 |accessdate=2011-08-07}}</ref> and it is likely that implementing legislation for the Bank will look quite different from that which was proposed in the original legislation. 
[[Barack Obama]] backed the proposed legislation in February 2008 and repeated his call in September 2010, although he did not provide specifics about how the Bank should operate. In 2008, Obama suggested that the Bank would borrow [[United States dollar|US$]]60 billion of federal funding to invest in infrastructure over 10 years, while leveraging "up to $500 billion" of private investment. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/sep/6/obama-propose-50b-infrastructure-projects/ |title=Obama to propose $50B in infrastructure projects |publisher=The Washington Times |date=September 6, 2010 |accessdate=2011-08-07}}</ref> It would invest in [[High-speed rail|high-speed train]]s to provide an alternative to air travel, [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], and [[clean energy]], among other kinds of public infrastructure. According to Obama, the Bank's "work will be determined by what will maximize our safety and security and ability to compete" and it would "create nearly two million new jobs", mainly in the construction industry. According to the text of the proposed legislation, funding for the bank would be taken from borrowed funds not to exceed one percent. <ref name=S1926>{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:s1926is.txt.pdf |title=S. 1926 - To establish the National Infrastructure Bank to provide funding for qualified infrastructure projects, and for other purposes. |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-08-07}}</ref> The Bank would complement existing federal programs to fund infrastructure, such as the [[Highway Trust Fund]] or State Revolving Funds. It is expected to invest primarily in surface transport infrastructure, which is likely to include highways and [[mass transit]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barackobama.com/issues/economy/#invest-for-jobs |title=Obama 'O8:Plan to Strengthen the Economy |publisher=Barackobama.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-07}}</ref> Obama did not mention investments in water supply and sanitation as an area of activity for the new Bank. The [[American Water Works Association]] (AWWA) estimates that investment in water supply and sanitation in the United States will have to be "over $250 billion above current levels of spending in the next 20 to 30 years" to replace aging infrastructure. <ref>[[Gary Zimmerman]], Executive Director of [[American Water Works Association|AWWA]] in the [[International Water Association]] 2008 Yearbook, p. 34</ref> The original version of the bill expired with the [[List of United States Congresses| 110th Congress]]; a different version of the bill was introduced into the [[List of United States Congresses| 112th Congress]] by U.S. Representative Rosa L. DeLauro (D - Connecticut 3rd District) as H.R. 402. <ref name="opencongress.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h402/show |title=H.R.402: National Infrastructure Development Bank Act of 2011 - U.S. Congress |publisher=OpenCongress |date= |accessdate=2011-08-07}}</ref> . 

==Summary of the proposed legislation==. 
The original version of the proposed legislation was introduced in the [[United States Senate]] as Senate Bill 1926 (S. 1926). <ref name=S1926 /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:SN01926:|/bss/110search.html |title=S. 1926 |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-08-07}}</ref> A similar bill has been introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]]. <ref name=HR3401>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:HR03401:|/bss/110search.html |title=H.R. 3401 |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-08-07}}</ref> The status of the bill can be tracked on [[THOMAS]].  
The original proposed legislation states that the "Bank" is actually "an independent establishment of the Federal Government, as defined in section 104 of Title 5, United States Code."<ref name=S1926 /> As explained in 5 US Code 104, an independent establishment of the Federal Government is "(1) an establishment in the executive branch (other than the [[United States Postal Service]] or the Postal Regulatory Commission) which is not an Executive department, military department, Government corporation, or part thereof, or part of an independent establishment; and (2) the Government Accountability Office."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t05t08+8+2++()%20%20AND%20((5)%20ADJ%20USC)%3ACITE%20AND%20(USC%20w%2F10%20(104))%3ACITE |title=5(104) U.S. Code |publisher=Uscode.house.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-08-07}}</ref> . 

According to the proposed legislation, the "Bank" would be administratively similar to the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC). The "Bank" would have the power to: conduct hearings, issue subpoenas, obtain information from any other federal agency, accept for funding any infrastructure project with a potential Federal commitment of $75 million or more, authority to determine the appropriate Federal share of spending for each project, to act as a centralized entity to provide financing for qualified infrastructure projects; to issue general purpose infrastructure bonds, and to provide direct subsidies to qualified infrastructure projects from amounts made available from the issuance of such bonds; to issue project-based infrastructure bonds for the financing of specific qualified infrastructure projects; to provide loan guarantees to State or local governments issuing debt to finance qualified infrastructure projects; to issue loans, at varying interest rates, including very low interest rates, to qualified project sponsors for qualified projects; to leverage resources and stimulate public and private investment in infrastructure; and to encourage States to create additional opportunities for the financing of infrastructure projects. <ref name=S1926 /> . 

The revised bill "Makes the Bank's Board of Directors responsible for monitoring and overseeing energy, environmental, telecommunications, and transportation infrastructure projects. Authorizes the Board to: (1) issue public benefit bonds and provide direct subsidies to infrastructure projects; (2) borrow on the global capital market and lend to entities and commercial banks for funding infrastructure projects; and (3) purchase, pool, and sell infrastructure-related loans and securities on such market. Requires the Board to establish criteria for determining project eligibility for financial assistance under this Act."<ref name="opencongress.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h402/show |title=H.R.402: National Infrastructure Development Bank Act of 2011 - U.S. Congress |publisher=OpenCongress |date= |accessdate=2011-08-07}}</ref> .
