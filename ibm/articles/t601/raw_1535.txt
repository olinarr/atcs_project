==Arguments against the temporary fix==. 
Although the [[American Trucking Association]] (ATA) is relieved that the act was extended ensuring further job proposals, the organization feels it is only a quick fix that will essentially boost employment temporarily. The organization is pushing for passing multi-year legislation, instead of, multi-month [[legislation]]. The organization feels that this is a long overdue problem that is being fixed on a short, temporary basis. <ref name="overdrive">Overdrive, Oct2011, Vol. 51 Issue 10, p71-71, 1/4p</ref> . 

The ATA's President, Bill Graves, is not convinced, and even though $27.5 billion in the jobs proposal initiated by Obama is going to help boost the nation's economy, by way of, funding needed repairs and expanding roads and bridges. It is only scratching the surface to the real problem at hand. Graves is skeptical of Obama's plans, in regards to, establishing an infrastructure bank and increasing other taxes to pay for roads, bridges, and other programs in the jobs bill. <ref name="overdrive" /> . 

==American Society of Civil Engineers==. 
The [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] spoke loudly to Congress regarding passing the Surface and Air Transportation Programs Extension Act of 2011, and to increase funding to aid in the country's broken infrastructure system. The programs were extended through to January 31, 2012. According to the "Failure to Act" division, if the United States does not invest in surface transportation programs soon, she will lose $900 billion. <ref>This Week in Washington; 9/9/2011, p6-6, 1p</ref> .

*[[Surface Transportation Security Priority Assessment]] (March, 2010): part of Obama's [[Homeland Security]] initiative, this assessment seeks to analyze the United States surface transportation system, which consists of Mass Transit, Highways, Freight Rail, and Pipelines. This interdependent network services millions of communities every day and is critical to the United States' economy. With more terrorist attacks on the world's mass transit systems, securing the surface transportation network from attacks requires efforts from many levels, including, but not limited to, all levels of government, the private and nonprofit sectors, communities, and citizens alike. <ref name="whitehouse.gov">http://www.whitehouse.gov</ref>{{failed verification|date=December 2011}}
