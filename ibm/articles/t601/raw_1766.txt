The Great Recession has affected the entire [[world economy]], with higher detriment in some countries than others. It is a major [[global recession]] characterized by various systemic imbalances and was sparked by the outbreak of the [[late-2000s financial crisis]].  . 

There are two [[word sense|senses]] of the word "[[recession]]": a less precise sense, referring broadly to "a period of reduced economic activity",<ref name="Merriam-Webster_recession">{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |title=headword "recession" |work=Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary online |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/recession |postscript=.}}</ref> and the academic sense used most often in [[economics]], which is [[operational definition|defined operationally]], referring specifically to the contraction phase of a [[business cycle]], with two or more consecutive quarters of negative [[GDP]] growth. By the economics-academic definition of the word "[[recession]]", the Great Recession ended in the U.S. in June or July 2009. <ref>Daniel Gross, [http://www.newsweek.com/id/206631?from=rss The Recession Is...

Large corporations and wealthy businessmen were minimally affected by the recession, and were the first to recover.

== Overview ==. 
According to the U.S. [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (the official arbiter of U.S. recessions) the recession began in December 2007. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/12/01/nber-makes-it-official-recession-started-in-december-2007/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=NBER Makes It Official: Recession Started in December 2007 | date=2008-12-01}}</ref> US mortgage-backed securities, which had risks that were hard to assess, were marketed around the world. A more broad based credit boom fed a global [[speculative bubble]] in [[real estate bubble|real estate]] and equities, which served to reinforce the risky lending practices. <ref>{{Cite book|first=Fred E. |last=Foldvary |url=http://www.foldvary.net/works/dep08.pdf |format=PDF|title=The Depression of 2008 |publisher=The Gutenberg Press |isbn=0-9603872-0-X |date=September 18, 2007 |accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2009/01/14/global-recession-2009-oped-cx_nr_0115roubini.html|title=A Global Breakdown Of The Recession In 2009|author=[[Nouriel Roubini]]|date=January 15, 2009|work=Forbes}}</ref> The precarious financial situation was made more difficult by a sharp increase in [[oil price increases since 2003|oil]] and [[2007–2008 world food price crisis|food prices]]. The emergence of [[subprime lending|sub-prime loan]] losses in 2007 began the crisis and exposed other risky loans and over-inflated asset prices. With loan losses mounting and the fall of [[Lehman Brothers]] on September 15, 2008, a major panic broke out on the inter-bank loan market. As share and housing prices declined, many large and well established [[investment bank|investment]] and [[commercial bank|commercial]] banks in the United States and [[Europe]] suffered huge losses and even faced bankruptcy, resulting in massive public financial assistance.  . 

A [[global recession]] has resulted in a sharp drop in [[international trade]], rising [[unemployment]] and slumping commodity prices. In December 2008, the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (NBER) declared that the United States had been in recession since December 2007. <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/12/01/news/economy/recession/index.htm?postversion=2008120112|title=It's official: Recession since Dec '07 |last=Isidore |first=Chris |date=2008-12-01 |publisher=CNN Money|accessdate=2009-04-10}}</ref> Several economists have predicted that recovery may not appear until 2011 and that the recession will be the worst since the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s. <ref>[http://www.mcclatchydc.com/251/story/60822.html Congressional Budget Office compares downturn to Great Depression].

The recession has renewed interest in [[2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence|Keynesian economic ideas]] on how to combat recessionary conditions. [[Fiscal policy|Fiscal]] and [[monetary policy|monetary policies]] have been significantly eased to stem the recession and financial risks.

==Pre-recession economic imbalances==. 
The onset of the economic crisis took most people by surprise. A 2009 paper identifies twelve economists and commentators who, between 2000 and 2006, predicted a recession based on the collapse of the then-booming housing market in the U.S:<ref name="Bezemer">Dirk J Bezemer: ''"No One Saw This Coming" Understanding Financial Crisis Through Accounting Models'', available via: [http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/15892/1/MPRA_paper_15892.pdf MPRA], esp. p. 9 and appendix. </ref> [[Dean Baker]], [[Wynne Godley]], [[Fred Harrison (author)|Fred Harrison]], [[Michael Hudson (economist)|Michael Hudson]], [[Eric Janszen]], [[Steve Keen]], [[Jakob Brøchner Madsen]] & Jens Kjaer Sørensen, [[Kurt Richebächer]], [[Nouriel Roubini]], [[Peter Schiff]] and [[Robert Shiller]]. <ref name="Bezemer"/> . 

A number of economic imbalances preceded the financial crisis: . 

===Commodity boom===.

The decade of the 2000s saw a global explosion in prices, focused especially in [[commodities]] and [[house|housing]], marking an end to the [[late-twentieth century commodities recession|commodities recession of 1980–2000]]. In 2008, the prices of many commodities, notably oil and food, rose so high as to cause genuine economic damage, threatening [[stagflation]] and a reversal of [[globalization]]. <ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://research.cibcwm.com/economic_public/download/smay08.pdf |format=PDF|last=Rubin|first=Jeff |publisher=CIBC World Markets |work=StrategEcon |date=May 27, 2008 |page= |accessdate=2009-01-04|title=The New Inflation}}</ref> . 

In January 2008, oil prices surpassed $100 a barrel for the first time, the first of many price milestones to be passed in the course of the year. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080227/ts_afp/commoditiesenergyoilprice|title= Crude oil prices set record high 102.08 dollars per barrel}}</ref> In July 2008, oil peaked at $147.30<ref name="tfc-charts.com">{{Cite web|url=http://tfc-charts.com/chart/QM/M |title=Light Crude Oil EmiNY (QM, NYMEX): Monthly Price Chart |publisher=Tfc-charts.com |date= |accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref> a barrel and a gallon of [[gasoline]] was more than $4 across most of the U.S.A. The economic contraction in the fourth quarter of 2008 caused a dramatic drop in demand and prices fell below $35 a barrel at the end of the year. <ref name="tfc-charts.com"/> The high of 2008 may have been part of broader pattern of spiking instability in the price of oil over the preceding decade  <ref>[http://www.energybulletin.net/node/50923 Tom Therramus, (editor, Gail the Actuary) - Was Volatility in the Price of Oil a Cause of the 2008 Financial Crisis? ]</ref> This pattern of spiking instability in oil price may be a product of [[Peak Oil]]. There is concern that if the economy was to improve, oil prices might return to pre-recession levels. <ref>Oil prices and future economic stability http://www.thestar.com/business/article/535378</ref> . 

The food and fuel crises were both discussed at the [[34th G8 summit]] in July 2008. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3466618,00.html|title= Africa's Plight Dominates First Day of G8 Summit}}</ref> . 

[[Sulfuric acid]] (an important chemical commodity used in processes such as [[Steel#Modern production methods|steel processing]], [[Copper#Production|copper production]] and [[Bioethanol#Sources|bioethanol production]]) increased in price 3.5-fold in less than 1 year while producers of [[sodium hydroxide]] have declared [[force majeure]] due to flooding, precipitating similarly steep price increases. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.purchasing.com/article/CA6554638.html|title=Sulfuric acid prices explode}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dow.com/causticsoda/news/2008/20080606a.htm|title=Dow Declares Force Majeure for Caustic Soda}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> . 

In the second half of 2008, the prices of most commodities fell dramatically on expectations of diminished demand in a world recession. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2008/10/10/16910/commodities-crash/|title=Commodities crash}}</ref> .

===Inflation===. 
In February 2008, Reuters reported that global inflation was at historic levels, and that domestic inflation was at 10–20 year highs for many nations. <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/02/12/business/inflate.php|title=Global inflation climbs to historic levels|publisher=International Herald Tribune|date=2008-02-12|accessdate=2008-07-11}}</ref> "Excess money supply around the globe, monetary easing by the Fed to tame financial crisis, growth surge supported by easy monetary policy in Asia, speculation in commodities, agricultural failure, rising cost of imports from China and rising demand of food and commodities in the fast growing emerging markets," have been named as possible reasons for the inflation. <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Perspectives/Are_emerging_economies_causing_inflation/articleshow/3208581.cms|title= Are emerging economies causing inflation?|publisher=Economic Times (India)|date=2008-07-08|accessdate=2008-07-11}}</ref> . 

In mid-2007, [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) data indicated that inflation was highest in the oil-exporting countries, largely due to the unsterilized growth of [[foreign exchange reserves]], the term "unsterilized" referring to a lack of [[Monetary policy#Trends in central banking|monetary policy operations that could offset such a foreign exchange intervention]] in order to maintain a country's monetary policy target. However, inflation was also growing in countries classified by the IMF as "non-oil-exporting LDCs" ([[Least Developed Countries]]) and "Developing Asia", on account of the rise in oil and food prices. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://content.ksg.harvard.edu/blog/jeff_frankels_weblog/2008/06/26/prospects-for-inflation-outside-america-guest-post-from-menzie-chinn/|title=Prospects for Inflation ''outside'' America – Guest Post from Menzie Chinn|publisher=Jeff Frankel's Weblog|date=2008-06-26|accessdate=2008-07-11}}</ref> .

===Debate over origins===. 
The central debate about the origin has been focused on the respective parts played by the public monetary policy (in the US notably) and by private financial institutions practices.  In the U.S., mortgage funding was unusually decentralized, opaque, and competitive, and it is believed that competition between lenders for revenue and market share contributed to declining underwriting standards and risky lending. <ref name="ssrn.com"/> . 

On October 15, 2008, Anthony Faiola, Ellen Nakashima, and Jill Drew wrote a lengthy article in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' titled, "What Went Wrong". <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/14/AR2008101403343.html?hpid=topnews&sid=ST2008101403344&s_pos=|title=What Went Wrong|coauthors=Anthony Faiola, Ellen Nakashima and Jill Drew|date=2008-10-15|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=2009-04-10}}</ref> In their investigation, the authors claim that former Federal Reserve Board Chairman [[Alan Greenspan]], Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, and [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] Chairman Arthur Levitt vehemently opposed any regulation of [[financial instruments]] known as [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]]. They further claim that Greenspan actively sought to undermine the office of the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]], specifically under the leadership of [[Brooksley E. Born]], when the Commission sought to initiate regulation of derivatives. Ultimately, it was the collapse of a specific kind of derivative, the [[mortgage-backed security]], that triggered the economic crisis of 2008.  . 

While Greenspan's role as [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve]] has been widely discussed (the main point of controversy remains the lowering of [[Federal funds rate]] at only 1% for more than a year which, according to the [[Austrian School]] of economics, allowed huge amounts of "easy" credit-based money to be injected into the financial system and thus create an unsustainable economic boom)<ref>{{Cite news|last=Polleit |first=Thorsten |url=http://mises.org/story/2810 |title=Manipulating the Interest Rate: a Recipe for Disaster |publisher=Mises Institute |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref> there is also the argument that Greenspan's actions in the years 2002–2004 were actually motivated by the need to take the U.S. economy out of the [[early 2000s recession]] caused by the bursting of the [[dot-com bubble]] — although by doing so he did not help avert the crisis, but only postpone it. <ref>{{Cite web|first=Ann |last=Pettifor |url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/america-s-financial-meltdown-lessons-and-prospects |title=America's financial meltdown: lessons and prospects |publisher=openDemocracy |date=16 September 2008 |accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|first=Stefan |last=Karlsson |url=http://www.mises.org/story/1670 |title=America's Unsustainable Boom |publisher=Mises Institute |date=2004-11-08 |accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref> . 

Some economists - those of the Austrian school and those predicting the recession such as Steve Keen - claim that the ultimate point of origin of the great financial crisis of 2007–2010 can be traced back to an extremely indebted US economy. The collapse of the real estate market in 2006 was the close point of origin of the crisis. The failure rates of subprime mortgages were the first symptom of a credit boom turned to bust and of a real estate shock. But large default rates on subprime mortgages cannot account for the severity of the crisis. Rather, low-quality mortgages acted as an accelerant to the fire that spread through the entire financial system. The latter had become fragile as a result of several factors that are unique to this crisis: the transfer of assets from the balance sheets of banks to the markets, the creation of complex and opaque assets, the failure of ratings agencies to properly assess the risk of such assets, and the application of fair value accounting. To these novel factors, one must add the now standard failure of regulators and supervisors in spotting and correcting the emerging weaknesses. <ref>Fratianni, M. and Marchionne, F. 2009.

Inflation adjusted median household income in the US peaked in 1999 at $53,252 (at the peak of the internet stock bubble), dropped to $51,174 in 2004, went up to 52,823 in 2007 (at the peak of the housing bubble), and has since trended downward to $49,445 in 2010. The last time median household income was at this level was in 1996 at $49,112 indicating that the recession of the early 2000s and the Great Recession have wiped out all middle class income gains for the last 15 years. <ref>http://www.davemanuel.com/median-household-income.php</ref> This income drop has caused a dramatic rise in people living under the poverty level and has hit suburbia particularly hard.  Between 2000 and 2010, the number of suburban households below the poverty line increased by 53 percent, compared to a 23 percent increase in poor households in urban areas. <ref>http://www.businessinsider.com/guess-americas-best-kept-housing-secret-2011-12?nr_email_referer=1&utm_source=Triggermail&utm_medium=email&utm_term=Business%20Insider%20Select&utm_campaign=BI%20Select%20Recurring%202011-12-27  "Between 2000 and 2010, the number of suburban households below the poverty line increased by 53 percent, compared to a 23 percent increase in poor households in urban areas, according to a Brookings Institution analysis of census data."</ref> .

* Real gross domestic product (GDP) began contracting in the third quarter of 2008, and by early 2009 was falling at an annualized pace not seen since the 1950s. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=1&Freq=Qtr&FirstYear=2007&LastYear=2009 |title=U.S. Department of Commerce.

* Capital investment, which was in decline year-on-year since the final quarter of 2006, matched the 1957–58 post war record in the first quarter of 2009. The pace of collapse in residential investment picked up speed in the first quarter of 2009, dropping 23.2% year-on-year, nearly four percentage points faster than in the previous quarter. 
* US Domestic demand, in decline for five straight quarters, is still three months shy of the 1974–75 record, but the pace – down 2.6% per quarter vs. 1.9% in the earlier period – is a record-breaker already. 
* A report in 2009 by Bloomberg states that $14.5 trillion of value of global companies has been erased since the crisis began. <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&sid=aGq2B3XeGKok |title=U.S. Taxpayers Risk $9.7 Trillion on Bailout Programs (Update1) |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2009-02-09 |accessdate=2011-04-18}}</ref>
* Despite such problems, per-capita GDP and median incomes remained relatively high by historical standards, with per-capita GDP in 2010 exceeding per-capita GDP of 2000.  Unemployment also never reached the levels of the early 1980s recession.  The recession was only historical in the sense of its contraction from recent unprecedented high points in national income and economic activity, not by comparison to most historical periods, including most of the past six decades.  . 

==Political instability related to the economic crisis== . 

Beginning February 26, 2009 an [[Economic Intelligence Briefing]] was added to the daily intelligence briefings prepared for the President of the United States. This addition reflects the assessment of United States intelligence agencies that the global financial crisis presents a serious threat to international stability. <ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/25/AR2009022503389.html "CIA Adds Economy To Threat Updates] White House Given First Daily Briefing" article by Joby Warrick, Washington Post Staff Writer, Thursday, February 26, 2009</ref>  .

Globally, mass protest movements have arisen in many countries as a response to the economic crisis.  Additionally, in some countries, riots and even open revolts have occurred in relation to the economic crisis.   . 

For example, the [[Arab Spring]] revolts taking place in the Arab world since December 18, 2010 were ostensibly sparked by the self-immolation of an unemployed Tunisian man named [[Mohamed Bouazizi]] who was prevented from even selling produce from a cart.

The [[global financial crisis of 2008–2009|financial phase of the crisis]] led to emergency interventions in many national financial systems. As the crisis developed into genuine recession in many major economies, economic stimulus meant to revive economic growth became the most common policy tool. After having implemented rescue plans for the banking system, major developed and emerging countries announced plans to relieve their economies.

===IMF recommendation===. 
The IMF stated in September 2010 that the financial crisis would not end without a major decrease in unemployment as hundreds of millions of people were unemployed worldwide. The IMF urged governments to expand social safety nets and to generate job creation even as they are under pressure to cut spending. Governments should also invest in skills training for the unemployed and even governments of countries like Greece with major debt risk should first focus on long-term economic recovery by creating jobs. <ref>New York Times, 2010 Sept. 13, "I.M.F.

China's export driven economy is starting to feel the impact of the economic slowdown in the United States and Europe, and the government has already cut key interest rates three times in less than two months in a bid to spur economic expansion. On November 28, 2008, the [[Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China]] and the [[State Administration of Taxation]] jointly announced a rise in export tax rebate rates on some labor-intensive goods.

In developing and emerging economies, responses to the global crisis mainly consisted in low-rates monetary policy ([[Asia]] and the [[Middle East]] mainly) coupled with the depreciation of the currency against the dollar. There were also stimulus plans in some Asian countries, in the Middle East and in Argentina. In Asia, plans generally amounted to 1 to 3% of GDP, with the notable exception of [[2008 Chinese economic stimulus plan|China]], which announced a plan accounting for 16% of GDP (6% of GDP per year).  .

Until September 2008, European policy measures were limited to a small number of countries (Spain and Italy). In both countries, the measures were dedicated to households (tax rebates) reform of the taxation system to support specific sectors such as housing. The European Commission proposed a [[2008 European Union stimulus plan|€200 billion stimulus plan]] to be implemented at the European level by the countries.

Some coordination took place at the European level, but the need to cooperate at the global level has led leaders to activate the [[G-20 major economies]] entity. A first summit dedicated to the crisis took place, at the Heads of state level in November 2008 ([[2008 G-20 Washington summit]]).  . 

The [[G-20 major economies|G-20 countries]] met in a summit held on [[2008 G-20 Washington summit|November 2008 in Washington]] to address the economic crisis. Apart from proposals on international financial regulation, they pledged to take measures to support their economy and to coordinate them, and refused any resort to protectionism.  . 

[[2009 G-20 London summit|Another G-20 summit]] was held in London on April 2009. Finance ministers and central banks leaders of the G-20 met in [[Horsham, England|Horsham]] on March to prepare the summit, and pledged to restore global growth as soon as possible. They decided to coordinate their actions and to stimulate demand and employment. They also pledged to fight against all forms of [[protectionism]] and to maintain trade and foreign investments. They also committed to maintain the supply of credit by providing more liquidity and recapitalizing the banking system, and to implement rapidly the stimulus plans. As for central bankers, they pledged to maintain low-rates policies as long as necessary. Finally, the leaders decided to help emerging and developing countries, through a strengthening of the IMF.  .

[[Poland]] is the only member of the [[European Union]] to have avoided a decline in GDP, meaning that in 2009 Poland has created the most GDP growth in the EU.

==Comparisons with the Great Depression==. 
{{main|Comparisons between the late-2000s recession and the Great Depression}} . 

On April 17, 2009, head of the IMF [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]] said that there was a chance that certain countries may not implement the proper policies to avoid feedback mechanisms that could eventually turn the recession into a depression.  "The free-fall in the global economy may be starting to abate, with a recovery emerging in 2010, but this depends crucially on the right policies being adopted today."  The IMF pointed out that unlike the Great Depression, this recession was synchronized by global integration of markets. Such synchronized recessions were explained to last longer than typical economic downturns and have slower recoveries. <ref>{{Cite news|last=Evans |first=Ambrose |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/recession/5166956/IMF-warns-over-parallels-to-Great-Depression.html |title=IMF warns over parallels to Great Depression |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2009-04-16 |accessdate=2010-01-21 | location=London}}</ref> . 

The chief economist of the IMF, Dr. [[Olivier Blanchard]], stated that the percentage of workers laid off for long stints has been rising with each downturn for decades but the figures have surged this time. "Long-term unemployment is alarmingly high: in the US, half the unemployed have been out of work for over six months, something we have not seen since the Great Depression." The IMF also stated that a link between rising inequality within Western economies and deflating demand may exist. The last time that the wealth gap reached such skewed extremes was in 1928-1929. <ref>The Telegraph (UK), 2010 Sept. 14, "IMF Fears 'Social Explosion' From World Jobs Crisis: America and Europe face the worst jobs crisis since the 1930s and risk 'an explosion of social unrest' unless they tread carefully, the International Monetary Fund has warned," http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/8000561/IMF-fears-social-explosion-from-world-jobs-crisis.html</ref> .

Mass unemployment has also affected the [[United Kingdom]] since the recession began. In late 2007, unemployment stood at around 1.6million. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7140069.stm]</ref> However, by early 2009 that figure had increased to more than 2 million and a year later it rose past the 2.5million mark.
