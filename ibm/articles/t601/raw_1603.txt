'''Jefferson Beauregard''' "'''Jeff'''" '''Sessions III''' (born December 24, 1946) is the junior [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Alabama]]. First elected in 1996, Sessions is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He serves as the [[ranking minority member]] on the [[United States Senate Committee on the Budget|Senate Budget Committee]].  . 

Raised in the town of Hybart in [[Monroe County, Alabama]], Sessions graduated from [[Huntingdon College]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] and the [[University of Alabama School of Law]]. In the 1970s he worked in private practice and rose to the rank of [[captain (United States)|captain]] in the [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Reserve]]. From 1981 to 1993 he served as [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Alabama|U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama]]. President [[Ronald Reagan]] nominated him to a judgeship on the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Alabama]] in 1986, but the Senate confirmation failed after it was alleged that he had made racist remarks to a colleague. Sessions was elected to [[Attorney General of Alabama]] in 1994. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1996 and easily re-elected in 2002 and 2008. He and his colleague [[Richard Shelby]] are the state's first two-term Republican Senators since [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]].  . 

Sessions was ranked by ''[[National Journal]]'' in 2007 as the fifth-most [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] U.S. Senator, siding strongly with the Republican Party on political issues. He supported the major legislative efforts of the [[George W. Bush]] administration, including the [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001|2001]] and [[Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003|2003 tax cut packages]], the [[Iraq War]], and a proposed [[Federal Marriage Amendment|national amendment to ban same-sex marriage]]. However, he was one of 25 senators to oppose the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|establishment of TARP]]. He has opposed the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] leadership since 2007 on most major legislation, including the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|stimulus bill]], the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], and the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010|''Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' Repeal Act]]. Formerly the ranking Republican on the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]], he opposed both of Obama's nominees for the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]].  .

==Political career==. 
===U.S. Attorney===. 
Sessions was an [[United States Attorney|Assistant United States Attorney]] in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Alabama|Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama]] beginning in 1975. In 1981, President Reagan nominated Sessions to be the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama. The Senate [[Advice and consent|confirmed]] him and he held that position for 12 years.  . 

===Failed nomination to the district court===. 
In 1986, Reagan nominated Sessions to be a judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama. Sessions was actively backed by Alabama Senator [[Jeremiah Denton]], a Republican. A substantial majority of the [[American Bar Association]] Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, which rates nominees to the federal bench, rated Sessions "qualified," with a minority voting that Sessions was "not qualified."<ref name=Goldman_1999_p309>

At Sessions' confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, four [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] lawyers who had worked with Sessions testified that he had made several racist statements. One of those lawyers, J. Gerald Hebert, testified that Sessions had referred to the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) as "[[un-American]]" and "[[Communism|Communist]]-inspired" because they "forced [[civil rights]] down the throats of people."<ref name=Wildman_2002>

Thomas Figures, a black Assistant U.S. Attorney, testified that Sessions said he thought the Klan was "OK until I found out they smoked [[marijuana|pot]]."<ref>{{cite web|last=Beutler |first=Brian |url=http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/05/sessions-colleague-i-thought-id-be-fired-if-i-objected-to-being-called-boy.php |title=Sessions Subordinate: I Thought I'd Be Fired If I Objected To Being Called 'Boy' &#124; TPMDC |publisher=Tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com |date=May 7, 2009 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> Figures also testified that on one occasion, when the [[United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division|U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division]] sent the office instructions to investigate a case that Sessions had tried to close, Figures and Sessions "had a very spirited discussion regarding how the Hodge case should then be handled; in the course of that argument, Mr. Sessions threw the file on a table, and remarked, 'I wish I could decline on all of them,'" by which Figures said Sessions meant civil rights cases generally. After becoming Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, Sessions was asked in an interview about his civil rights record as a U.S Attorney. He denied that he had not sufficiently pursued civil rights cases, saying that "when I was [a U.S. Attorney], I signed 10 pleadings attacking [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] or the remnants of segregation, where we as part of the Department of Justice, we sought [[desegregation]] remedies."<ref>National Journal, [http://www.nationaljournal.com/njonline/no_20090507_5499.php "Sessions Says He's Looking For Judicial Restraint"], May 7, 2009</ref> . 

Figures also said that Sessions had called him "boy." He also testified that "Mr. Sessions admonished me to 'be careful what you say to white folks.'"<ref>Talking Points Memo, [http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/05/sessions-colleague-i-thought-id-be-fired-if-i-objected-to-being-called-boy.php "Sessions Subordinate: I Thought I'd Be Fired If I Objected To Being Called 'Boy'"] May 7, 2009</ref> . 

Sessions responded to the testimony by denying the allegations, saying his remarks were taken out of context or meant in jest, and also stating that groups could be considered un-American when "they involve themselves in un-American positions" in [[foreign policy]]. Sessions said during testimony that he considered the Klan to be "a force for hatred and
bigotry." In regards to the marijuana quote, Sessions said the comment was a joke but apologized. <ref name=Rudin2009>

In response to a question from [[Joe Biden]] on whether he had called the NAACP and other civil rights organizations "un-American", Sessions replied "I'm often loose with my tongue. I may have said something about the NAACP being un-American or Communist, but I meant no harm by it."<ref name=Goldman_1999_p309/> . 

On June 5, 1986, the Committee voted 10-8 against recommending the nomination to the Senate floor, with Republican Senators [[Charles Mathias]] of [[Maryland]] and [[Arlen Specter]] of [[Pennsylvania]] voting with the Democrats. It then split 9-9 on a vote to send Sessions' nomination to the Senate floor with no recommendation, with Specter again voting with the Democrats. The pivotal votes against Sessions came from Democratic Senator [[Howell Heflin]] of Alabama. Although Heflin had previously backed Sessions, he began to oppose Sessions after hearing testimony, concluding that there were "reasonable doubts" over Sessions' ability to be "fair and impartial." The nomination was withdrawn on July 31, 1986.  . 

Sessions became only the second nominee to the [[United States federal courts|federal judiciary]] in 48 years whose nomination was killed by the Senate Judiciary Committee. <ref name=Rudin2009/> . 

Sessions was quoted then as saying that the Senate on occasion had been insensitive to the rights and reputation of nominees. <ref name="CQMay2009">Kathleen Hunter and Bart Jansen, [http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docid=news-000003108508 All Eyes on Grassley for Judiciary Republicans‚Äô Post-Specter Shuffle], ''CQ Politics'', May 1, 2009</ref><ref name="USAToday">Matt Kelley, [http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-05-28-sessions_N.htm Supreme Court pick Sotomayor under fire for comments], ''USA Today'', May 29, 2009</ref> . 

One law clerk from the U.S. District Court in Mobile who had worked with Sessions later acknowledged the confirmation controversy, but stated that he observed Sessions as "a lawyer of the highest ethical and intellectual standards."<ref>Victor Williams, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/victor-williams/new-gang-of-14-applying-l_b_480869.html ""New Gang of 14" : Applying "Lets Get This Done" to Appointments"], ''Huffington Post'', March 1, 2010</ref> . 

After joining the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sessions remarked that his presence there, alongside several of the members who voted against him, was a "great irony."<ref name="CQMay2009"/> When Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania left the GOP to join the Democratic Party on April 28, 2009, Sessions was selected to be the Ranking Member on the Senate Judiciary Committee. At that time, Specter said that his vote against Sessions' nomination was a mistake, because he had "since found that Sen. Sessions is egalitarian."<ref>Manu Raju, [http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0509/22131.html "Specter regrets 'no' vote on Sessions"], ''Politico'', May 5, 2009</ref> .

Bush|George W. Bush's nominees to the federal courts]]. When the "[[Gang of 14]]" group of moderate Senators reached an agreement to allow filibusters under "extraordinary circumstances," Sessions accepted the agreement but argued that "a return to the tradition of up-or-down votes on all judicial nominees would‚Ä¶ strengthen the Senate."<ref>{{cite news|last=Sessions|first=Jeff|title=Playing by Reid's rules on filibusters|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/25/AR2009112503535_pf.html|accessdate=16 September 2011|newspaper=Washington Post|date=November 27, 2009}}</ref> .

Sessions focused on Sotomayor's views on empathy as a quality for a judge, arguing that "empathy for one party is always prejudice against another."<ref>Robert Barnes, Amy Goldstein,Paul Kane, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/07/14/MND318NTQ3.DTL "Nominee Sotomayor at center stage in Senate"], ''San Francisco Chronicle'', July 14, 2009</ref> Sessions also questioned the nominee about her views on the use of foreign law in deciding cases,<ref>Steve Padilla, [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/07/sotomayor-hearings-judge-is-adamant-sessions-is-unconvinced.html "Sotomayor hearings: Judge is adamant, Sessions is unconvinced"], ''Los Angeles Times'', July 15, 2009</ref> as well as her role in the [[Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund]] (PRLDEF). On July 28, 2009, Sessions joined five Republican colleagues in voting against Sotomayor's nomination in the Judiciary Committee. The committee approved Sotomayor by a vote of 13-6. <ref>

He was one of 31 senators (all  Republicans) to do so, while 68 voted to confirm the nominee. <ref>[http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session=1&vote=00262 Roll Call Vote on the Nomination of Sonia Sotomayor], ''U.S. Senate'', August 6, 2009</ref> . 

Sessions also served as the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee during the nomination process for [[Elena Kagan]], President Obama‚Äôs nominee to succeed [[John Paul Stevens|retired Justice John Paul Stevens]]. Sessions based his opposition on the nominee‚Äôs lack of experience, her background as a political operative (Kagan had said that she worked in the Clinton White House not as a lawyer but as a policy adviser<ref>Elena Kagan, [http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Kagan-speech_WestPoint.pdf/ "Speech to West Point Cadets"], October 17, 2007</ref>), and her record on guns,abortion, and gay rights. Sessions pointed out that Kagan ‚Äúhas a very thin record legally, never tried a case, never argued before a jury, only had her first appearance in the appellate courts a year ago."<ref>Bruce Drake, [http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/06/27/republicans-to-focus-on-whether-elena-kagan-would-be-a-judicial/ "Republicans to Focus on Whether Elena Kagan Would be a Judicial Activist"], ''Politics Daily'', June 27, 2010</ref> . 

Sessions focused the majority of his criticism on Kagan‚Äôs treatment of the military while she was dean of Harvard Law School. During her tenure, Kagan reinstated the practice of requiring military recruiters to coordinate their activities through a campus veterans organization, rather than the school‚Äôs Office of Career Services. Kagan argued that she was trying to comply with a law known as the [[Solomon Amendment]], which barred federal funds from any college or university that did not grant military recruiters equal access to campus facilities. Sessions asserted that Kagan‚Äôs action was a violation of the Solomon Amendment and that it amounted to ‚Äúdemeaning and punishing the military. <ref>Jeff Sessions, [http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2010-07-21-sessions21_ST_N.htm/ "A big-government vision"], ''USA Today'', July 20, 2010</ref> He also argued that her action showed a willingness to place her politics above the law.  . 

On July 20, 2010, Sessions and five Republican colleagues voted against Kagan‚Äôs nomination. Despite this, the Judiciary Committee approved the nomination by a 13-6 vote. Sessions also voted against Kagan in the full Senate vote, joining 36 other senators (including one Democrat) in opposition. 63 senators voted to confirm Kagan. Following the vote, Sessions remarked on future nominations and elections, saying that Americans would "not forgive the Senate if we further expose our Constitution to revision and rewrite by judicial fiat to advance what President Obama says is a broader vision of what America should be."<ref>Carl Hulse, [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/06/us/politics/06kagan.html/ "Senate Confirms Kagan in Partisan Vote"], ''New York Times'', August 5, 2010</ref> .
