'''Freedom of thought''' (also called the '''freedom of conscience''' or '''ideas''') is the [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] of an individual to hold or consider a fact, viewpoint, or [[thought]], independent of others' viewpoints.  . 

It is different from and not to be confused with the concept of [[freedom of speech|freedom of speech or expression]].  . 

==Overview==. 
<!-- Note: perhaps something could be mentioned here about the Four Freedoms proposed by Franklin Roosevelt, which also includes freedom from fear and freedom from want -->

'Freedom of thought' is the derivative of and thus is closely linked to other liberties: [[freedom of religion]], [[freedom of speech]], and [[freedom of expression]]. It is a very important concept in the western world and nearly all democratic constitutions protect these freedoms. For instance, the [[United States Bill of Rights|U.S. Bill of Rights]] contains the famous guarantee in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] that laws may not be made that interfere with religion "or prohibiting the free exercise thereof". A US [[Supreme Court Justice]] ([[Benjamin Cardozo]]) reasoned in ''[[Palko v. Connecticut]]'' (1937) that: . 

{{quote|Freedom of thought... is the matrix, the indispensable condition, of nearly every other form of freedom. With rare aberrations a pervasive recognition of this truth can be traced in our history, political and legal. <ref>{{cite court

Such ideas are also a vital part of [[international human rights law]]. In the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), which is legally binding on member states of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], ''freedom of thought'' is listed under Article 18: . 

{{quote|Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.}} . 

The [[Human Rights Committee]] states that this, "distinguishes the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief from the freedom to manifest religion or belief. It does not permit any limitations whatsoever on the freedom of thought and conscience or on the freedom to have or adopt a religion or belief of one's choice. These freedoms are protected unconditionally."<ref>{{cite web

==Suppression==.

{{Censorship}} . 

The obvious impediment to censoring thought is that it is impossible to know with certainty what another person is thinking, and harder to regulate it. Many famous historical works recognize this. The Bible summarizes in [[Ecclesiastes]] 8:8: "There is no man that has power over the spirit, to retain it; neither has he power in the day of death." A similar sentiment is expressed in the teachings of [[Jesus]] in the [[New Testament]], where he likens those who attempt to control the emotions of their neighbours to "the children in the marketplace" who try to produce dancing with a happy song and mourning with a dirge, and then express frustration at their futility in trying to do so ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 11:16). The concept is developed more specifically in the writings of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] ("For why should my freedom [''eleutheria''] be judged by another's conscience [''suneideseos'']?" [[1 Corinthians]] 10:29.) . 

[[Queen Elizabeth I]] revoked a thought censorship law in the late sixteenth century, because, according to Sir [[Francis Bacon]], she did "'not [like] to make windows into men's souls and secret thoughts". <ref>{{cite book

However, [[freedom of expression]] can be limited through [[censorship]], arrests, [[book burning]], or [[propaganda]], and this tends to discourage freedom of thought. Examples of effective campaigns against freedom of expression are the Soviet suppression of genetics research in favor of a theory known as [[Lysenkoism]], the book burning campaigns of [[Nazi Germany]], the radical [[anti-intellectualism]] enforced in [[Cambodia]] under [[Pol Pot]], and the strict limits on freedom of expression imposed by the [[communist state|Communist]] governments of the Peoples Republic of China and Cuba.  . 

Freedom of expression can also be stifled without institutional interference when [[majority]] views become so widely accepted that the entire culture represses dissenting views. For this reason, some condemn [[political correctness]] as a form of limiting freedom of thought. Although political correctness aims to give minority views equal representation, the majority view itself can be politically correct; for example, college student Max Karson was arrested following the [[Virginia Tech shootings]] for politically incorrect comments that authorities saw as "sympathetic to the killer." Karson's arrest raised important questions regarding freedom of thought and whether or not it applies in times of tragedy.  . 

The [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]], which states that [[thought]] is inherently embedded in [[language]], would support the claim that an effort to limit the use of words of language is actually a form of restricting freedom of thought.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} This was explored in [[George Orwell]]'s novel'' [[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]]'', with the idea of [[Newspeak]], a stripped-down form of the [[English language]] lacking the capacity for metaphor and limiting expression of original ideas.  . 

===Internet censorship===.

Mobitel and Hello are not currently blocking the Blogspot domain.  . 

===Other effects of the Internet on freedom of thought===. 
In an issue distinct from deliberate [[censorship]] by the authorities, another aspect of the implications of the [[Internet]] for freedom of thought is the effect of user personalised content delivery (including but not limited to [[online advertising]]), an idea written about by [[Eli Pariser]], in a 2011 book, entitled: ''The filter bubble : what the Internet is hiding from you.''<ref>{{cite book|last=Pariser|first=Eli|title=The filter bubble : what the Internet is hiding from you|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Press|location=New York|isbn=9781594203008|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wcalrOI1YbQC}}</ref> .
