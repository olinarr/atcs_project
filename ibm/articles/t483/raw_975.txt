People working with [[Information sensitivity|sensitive information]] are commonly required to sign a statement to the effect that they agree to abide by the restrictions of the Official Secrets Act.  This is popularly referred to as "signing the Official Secrets Act." Signing this has no effect on which actions are legal, as the act is a [[law]], not a [[contract]], and individuals are bound by it whether or not they have signed it. Signing it is intended more as a reminder to the person that they are under such obligations. To this end, it is common to sign this statement both before and after a period of employment that involves access to secrets.  . 

===Other legislation===. 
In addition to the Official Secrets Acts, the [[Naval Discipline Act 1957]] makes it an offence punishable with [[life imprisonment]] to spy on [[Royal Navy]] ships or overseas bases. <ref>[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&Year=1957&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=1292014&ActiveTextDocId=1292225&filesize=2764 Naval Discipline Act 1957 (c. 53), Part III Provisions relating to civilians and civil authorities, Section 93]. Accessed 15 January 2008. </ref> This was a capital offence until 1981.  . 

==Official Secrets Acts in other countries==. 
The phrase ''official secrets act'' may also be used to refer to statutes of a similar nature in other countries.  [[Canada]] has similar legislation titled the ''[[Security of Information Act]]'' (which was created in the wake of [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11th 2001]] to replace the vaguely worded Official Secrets Act<ref>Don Butler, [http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=2504f6b0-4ba0-4441-82bb-56dd1c784bd8&k=48585 "Judge quashes law, warrants authorizing RCMP raid on Citizen reporter"], ''[[The Province]]'', October 19, 2006. Accessed 15 January 2008. </ref>).  . 

The [[United States]] does not have any Official Secrets Act, although the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] has similar components. Much of the Espionage Act remains in force, although some has been struck down by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] as [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] because of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] (See ''[[United States v. The Progressive]]'', ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'', ''[[New York Times Co. v. United States]]'').  . 

In the [[Republic of Ireland]] the [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1963/en/act/pub/0001/index.html Official Secrets Act, 1963] repealed previous [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] legislation of 1911 and 1920. The Official Secrets Act, as amended, applies to all [[Civil service of the Republic of Ireland|civil servants]] and potentially anyone within the state. A suit may only be instigated at the approval of the [[Attorney General of Ireland]], additionally proceedings may occur [[in camera]] but the verdict and any sentence must occur in public.  . 

[[Malaysia]] has an [[Official Secrets Act (Malaysia)|Official Secrets Act]] (also referred to as the OSA) prohibiting the collection, possession or distribution of information marked as an official secretâ€”an action which can be made by any public officer. The certification of a document as an official secret is not subject to [[judicial review]], and a violation of the act is punishable with between one and seven years' imprisonment. The act has been controversial for its use to silence dissent and stifling anti-corruption activities. <ref>Pauline Puah, [http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-n/2006/09/osa-stays-says-nazri.htm "OSA stays, says Nazri"], ''[[Malaysia Today]]'', September 19, 2006. </ref> . 

[[Australia]] has Part VII of the [[Crimes Act 1914]] (Commonwealth), entitled ''Official Secrets and Unlawful Soundings''.  .
