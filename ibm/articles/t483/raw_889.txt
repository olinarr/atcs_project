'''Free speech zones''' (also known as '''First Amendment Zones''', '''Free speech cages''', and '''Protest zones''') are areas set aside in public places for [[political activist]]s to exercise their right of [[free speech]] in the United States. The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] states that "[[United States Congress|Congress]] shall make no law... abridging... the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances." The existence of free speech zones is based on U.S. court decisions stipulating that the government may regulate the time, place, and manner—but not content—of expression.  A Free Speech Zone is more restrictive than an [[Exclusion zone]].  . 

The Supreme Court has developed a four-part analysis to evaluate the constitutionality of time, place and manner (TPM) restrictions. To pass muster under the First Amendment, TPM restrictions must be neutral with respect to content, narrowly drawn, serve a significant government interest, and leave open alternative channels of communication. Application of this four-part analysis varies with the circumstances of each case, and typically requires lower standards for the restriction of [[obscenity]] and [[fighting words]].  . 

Free speech zones have been used at a variety of political gatherings. The stated purpose of free speech zones is to protect the safety of those attending the political gathering, or for the safety of the protesters themselves. Critics, however, suggest that such zones are "[[Orwellian]]",<ref>Bailey, Ronald. [http://www.reason.com/news/show/33381.html Orwellian "Free Speech Zones" violate the constitution].

Though authorities generally deny specifically targeting protesters, on a number of occasions, these denials have been contradicted by subsequent court testimony. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) has filed, with various degrees of success and failure, a number of lawsuits on the issue.  .

Many colleges and universities earlier instituted free speech zone rules during the [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|Vietnam-era protests]] of the 1960s and 1970s. In recent years, a number of them have revised or removed these restrictions following student protests and lawsuits.  .

Free speech zones have been used for non-political purposes. Through 1990s, the San Francisco International Airport played host to a steady stream of religious groups (Hare Krishnas in particular), preachers, and beggars. The city considered whether this critical public transportation hub was required to host free speech, and to what extent. As a compromise, two "free speech booths" were installed in the South Terminal, and groups wishing to speak but not having direct business at the airport were directed there. These booths still exist, although permits are required simply to access the booths. <ref>San Francisco International Airport,[http://www.flysfo.com/web/page/sao/info/permits/index.html], Retrieved August 17, 2009</ref> .

Free speech zones were commonly used by President George W Bush after the September 11, 2001 attacks and through the 2004 election. Free speech zones were set up by the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]], who scouted locations where the U.S. president was scheduled to speak, or pass through. Officials targeted those who carried anti-Bush signs and escorted them to the free speech zones prior to and during the event. Reporters were often barred by local officials from displaying these protesters on camera or speaking to them within the zone. <ref name="bushzones"/><ref name="freedomunderfire"/> Protesters who refused to go to the free speech zone were often arrested and charged with [[trespass]]ing, [[disorderly conduct]] and/or [[resisting arrest]]. <ref name="sfgate">Bovard, James.

The preliminary plan for the [[2004 Democratic National Convention]] was criticized by the  [[National Lawyers Guild]] and the ACLU of Massachusetts as being insufficient to handle the size of the expected protest.

==Notable incidents and court proceedings==. 
In 1939, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] found in [[Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization]] that public streets and parks "have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions." In the later ''[[Thornhill v. Alabama]]'' case, the court found that [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]] and marching in public areas is protected by the [[United States Constitution]] as free speech. However, subsequent rulings - ''[[Edwards v. South Carolina]]'', ''[[Brown v. Louisiana]]'', ''[[Cox v. Louisiana]]'', and ''[[Adderley v. Florida]]'' - found that picketing is afforded less protection than pure speech due to the physical [[externalities]] it creates. Regulations on demonstrations may affect the time, place, and manner of those demonstrations, but may not discriminate based on the content of the demonstration.  . 

The Secret Service denies targeting the President's political opponents. "Decisions made in the formulation of a security plan are based on security considerations, not political considerations," said one Secret Service spokesman. <ref>Cowan, Lee.

===Bill Neel===. 
"These [Free Speech] zones routinely succeed in keeping protesters out of presidential sight and outside the view of media covering the event. When Bush came to the [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] area on Labor Day 2002, 65-year-old retired steel worker Bill Neel was there to greet him with a sign proclaiming, 'The Bush family must surely love the poor, they made so many of us.' The local police, at the Secret Service's behest, set up a 'designated free-speech zone' on a [[baseball field]] surrounded by a chain-link [[fence]] a third of a mile from the location of Bush's speech. The police cleared the path of the [[motorcade]] of all critical signs, though folks with pro-Bush signs were permitted to line the president's path. Neel refused to go to the designated area and was arrested for disorderly conduct. Police detective John Ianachione testified that the Secret Service told local police to confine 'people that were there making a statement pretty much against the president and his views.'"<ref name="amconmag"/><ref>[http://homepage.ntlworld.com/jksonc/docs/neel-2002-10-31.html Pennsylvania v.

===Brett Bursey===. 
At another incident during a presidential visit to [[South Carolina]], protester Brett Bursey refused an order by Secret Service agents to go to a free speech zone half-a-mile away. He was arrested and charged with [[trespass]]ing by the South Carolina police. "Bursey said that he asked the policeman if 'it was the content of my sign,' and he said, 'Yes, sir, it's the content of your sign that's the problem.'"<ref name="amconmag"/> However, the prosecution, led by [[James Strom Thurmond Jr.]], disputes Bursey's version of events. <ref>Thurmond, J.

Retrieved from the WarLaw archive on January 2, 2006. </ref> Trespassing charges against Bursey were dropped, and Bursey was instead indicted by the federal government for violation of a federal law that allows the Secret Service to restrict access to areas visited by the president. <ref name="amconmag"/> Bursey faced up to six months in prison and a [[US dollar|US$]]5,000 fine. <ref name="amconmag"/> After a [[bench trial]], Bursey was convicted of the offense of trespassing, but judge Bristow Marchant deemed the offense to be relatively minor and ordered a fine of $500 be assessed, which Bursey appealed, and lost. <ref name="Bursey">[http://homepage.ntlworld.com/jksonc/docs/bursey-dsc-d87.html United States v. Bursey Transcript of Verdict Hearing].

Marchant's ruling however, was criticized for three reasons:
* The ruling found that Bursey was not the victim of selective prosecution because Bursey was the only person who had refused an order to leave the area. However, this overlooks the fact that nobody else refused to leave the zone because nobody else was asked to leave. <ref name="katz">Katz, Jonathan. [http://www.slate.com/id/2107012/ Thou Dost Protest Too Much]. [[Slate Magazine]], September 21, 2004. Retrieved January 23, 2007</ref>
* The prosecution claimed that the protected zone around the President was 100 yards wide. However, it was unmarked, with cars and trucks allowed to pass through and drop off ticket-holders, and nobody was willing to tell protesters where the zone's boundaries were. Marchant's decision noted this but did not find this unreasonable. <ref name="katz"/>
* Marchant found that in the "age of [[suicide bombing|suicide bombers]]", the Secret Service should have latitude to get rid of anyone suspicious who is standing near the president's route. However, given that the reason Bursey was singled out by the Secret Service was his sign, "it's enough to make anyone with a dissenting view think twice before deciding to stand out from a crowd."<ref name="katz"/> .

First, as always, work with the Secret Service to and have them ask the local police department to designate a protest area where demonstrators can be placed, preferably not in view of the event site or motorcade route. The formation of 'rally squads' is a common way to prepare for demonstrators... The rally squad's task is to use their signs and banners as shields between the demonstrators and the main press platform...

==On college and university campuses==. 
The use of free speech zones on university campuses is controversial. Many universities created on-campus free speech zones during the 1960s and 1970s, during which protests on-campus (especially against the [[Vietnam War]]) were common. Generally, the requirements are that the University is given advance notice and that they are held in locations that do not disrupt classes.  . 

In 1968, the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]'' that non-disruptive speech is permitted in public schools. However, this does not apply to [[private university|private universities]]. In September, 2004, U.S. District Court Judge Sam Cummings struck down the free speech zone policy at [[Texas Tech University]]. "According to the opinion of the court, campus areas such as parks, sidewalks, streets and other areas are designated as public forums, regardless of whether the university has chosen to officially designate the areas as such. The university may open more of the campus as public forums for its students, but it cannot designate fewer areas... Not all places within the boundaries of the campus are public forums, according to Cummings' opinion. The court declared the university's policy unconstitutional to the extent that it regulates the content of student speech in areas of the campus that are public forums". <ref>Lora, Meghann.

In December 2005, the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|College Libertarians]] at the [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]] staged a protest outside the University's designated protest zones. The specific intent of the protest was to provoke just such a charge, in order to "provoke the system into action into a critical review of what's going on."<ref name="UNCG">Withers, Lanita.

At [[Marquette University]], philosophy department chairman James South ordered graduate student Stuart Ditsler to remove an unattributed [[Dave Barry]] quote from the door to the office that Ditsler shared with three other teaching assistants, calling the quote patently offensive. (The quote was: "As Americans we must always remember that we all have a common enemy, an enemy that is dangerous, powerful, and relentless. I refer, of course, to the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]].") South claimed that the University's free-speech zone rules required Ditsler to take it down.
