{{Criminal law}}
'''Threatening the President of the United States''' is a [[classes of offenses under United States federal law|class D felony]] under [[United States Code]] Title 18, Section 871. It consists of [[knowingly]] and [[Intention (criminal law)|willfully]] mailing or otherwise making "any threat to take the life of, to kidnap, or to inflict bodily harm upon the [[President of the United States]]". The [[United States Secret Service]] investigates suspected violations of this law and monitors those who have a history of threatening the President. Because the offense consists of [[pure speech]], the courts have issued rulings attempting to balance the government's interest in protecting the President with [[free speech]] rights under the [[First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States]]. According to ''Stalking, Threatening, and Attacking Public Figures'', "Hundreds of celebrity howlers threaten the President of the United States every year, sometimes because they disagree with his policies, but more often just because he is the President."<ref>{{cite book|title=Stalking, Threatening, and Attacking Public Figures: A Psychological and Behavioral Analysis|author=Meloy, J.

The prototype for Section 871 was the British [[Treason Act 1351]], which made it a crime to "compass or imagine" the death of the King.

For instance, the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] held that a threat was knowingly made if the maker comprehended the meaning of the words uttered by him. It was willingly made, if in addition to comprehending the meaning of his words, the maker voluntarily and intentionally uttered them as a declaration of apparent determination to carry them into execution. <ref>{{cite court|litigants=Ragansky v.

==Frequency==. 
The first prosecutions under the statute, enacted in 1917, occurred during the highly charged, hyperpatriotic years of [[World War I]], and the decisions handed down by the courts in these early cases reflected intolerance for any words demonstrating even a vague spirit of disloyalty. <ref name=Jasick/><ref name=Stobo/> There was a relative [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on prosecutions under this statute until the [[World War II]] era. The number increased during the turbulent [[Vietnam War]] era. They have tended to fall when the country has not been directly embroiled in a national crisis situation. <ref name=Comment/> . 

The number of reported threats rose from 2,400 in 1965 to 12,800 in 1969. <ref name=Time/> According to some reports, President [[George W. Bush]] received about 3,000 threats a year, while his successor [[Barack Obama]] received about four times that many. <ref>{{citation|title=Barack Obama faces 30 death threats a day, stretching US Secret Service|date=03 Aug 2009|publisher=Telegraph|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/barackobama/5967942/Barack-Obama-faces-30-death-threats-a-day-stretching-US-Secret-Service.html | location=London | first=Toby | last=Harnden | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}</ref> This figure has been disputed by Secret Service Director [[Mark J.

According to the U.S. Attorneys' Manual, "Media attention given to certain kinds of criminal activity seems to generate further criminal activity; this is especially true concerning Presidential threats which is well documented by data previously supplied by the United States Secret Service. For example, in the six-month period following the March 30, 1981, [[Reagan assassination attempt|attempt on the life of President Reagan]], the average number of threats against protectees of the Secret Service increased by over 150&nbsp;percent from a similar period during the prior year." For this reason, the agency recommends considering the use of [[sealed affidavit]]s to keep news of threats from leaking to the press. <ref name=USAM/> .

==History==. 
The prototype for Section 871 was the British [[Treason Act 1351]], which made it a crime to "compass or imagine" the death of the King. <ref>25 Edw. III, c. 2 (1351)</ref><ref>{{cite court|litigants=United States v. Carrier|vol=672|reporter=F. 2d|opinion=300|date=March 1, 1982|court=2nd Cir.}}</ref> The statute prohibiting threats against the President was enacted by Congress in 1917. The maximum fine it allowed was $1,000. The law was amended in 1994 to increase the maximum fine to $250,000. <ref>{{citation|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/18/I/41/871/notes|title=Act September 13, 1994}}</ref> . 

Among the justifications that have been given for the statute include arguments that threats against the President have a tendency to stimulate opposition to national policies, however wise, even in the most critical times; to incite the hostile and evil-minded to take the President's life; to add to the expense of the President's safeguarding; to be an affront to all loyal and right-thinking persons; to inflame their minds; to provoke resentment, disorder, and violence;<ref name=Stickrath>{{cite court|litigants=United States v.

United States|year=1969|court=CA9 Cal|vol=416|reporter=F2d|opinion=874|url=http://openjurist.org/416/f2d/874/roy-v-united-states|quote=One purpose of the statute  may have been to prevent assaults upon the President. Another purpose may have been to prevent statements that would have the effect of inciting others to assault the President. The statute seems to be designed to prevent a further  mischief or evil, for if Congress desired to prevent an actual assault  upon the President, then it could have drafted the statute to make it a  crime to assault, attempt to assault, or conspire to assault the  President. There would have been no need to direct the statute to  threats. Similarly, if Congress desired to prevent incitement of others  to assault the President, then it could have limited the statute to make  it a crime to incite or induce others to assault or attempt to assault  the President. Thus, it appears that the statute was designed in part  to prevent an evil other than assaults upon the President or incitement  to assault the President. It is our view that the other evil is the  detrimental effect upon Presidential activity and movement that may result simply from a threat upon the President's life.}}</ref><ref>''[[Rogers v. United States]]'', {{ussc|95|2091|1975}}. Justice Marshall (concurring): "Plainly, threats may be costly and dangerous to society in a variety of  ways, even when their authors have no intention whatever of carrying  them out.  Like a threat to blow up a building, a serious threat on the  President's life is enormously disruptive and involves substantial cost  to the government.  A threat made with no present intention of carrying it out may still restrict the President's movements and require a  reaction from those charged with protecting the President."</ref> It has also been argued that such threats are akin to treason and can be rightly denounced as a crime against [[popular sovereignty|the people as the sovereign power]]. <ref name=Stickrath/> Congressman [[Edwin Y. Webb]] noted, "That is one reason why we want this statute – in order to decrease the possibility of actual assault by punishing threats to commit an assault ... A bad man can make a public threat, and put somebody else up to committing a crime against the Chief Executive, and that is where the harm comes. The man who makes the threat is not himself very dangerous, but he is liable to put devilment in the mind of some poor fellow who does try to harm him."<ref>53 Cong.Rec. 9377-78 (1916)</ref> . 

Prisoners are sometimes charged for threatening the President though they lack the ability to personally carry out such a threat. The courts have upheld such convictions,<ref>{{cite court|litigants=United States v. Glover|url=http://openjurist.org/846/f2d/339|year=1988|court=CA6 Ky|vol=846|reporter=F2d|opinion=339|quote=We believe the threats made in the letters sent to the President were of  a nature that a reasonable person would foresee that the receiver of  the letters would perceive them to be a serious intention to inflict  bodily harm upon or take the life of the President.  If the appellant's  argument were accepted, no prisoner could be convicted under this  statute, since his argument seems to be premised on the idea that  prisoners are incapable of carrying out threats, therefore, no  reasonable person could consider such a threat to be a true threat.   This premise is faulty.   See United States v. Leaverton, 835 F.2d 254 (10th  Cir.1987) (inmates convicted for sending simulated mail bomb to Senator  Robert Dole).}}</ref> reasoning that actual ability to carry out the threat is not an [[element of the offense]]; prisoners are able to make true threats as they could carry out the threat by directing people on the outside to harm the President. Sometimes prisoners make such threats to manipulate the system; e.g., a case arose in which an inmate claiming to be "[[Institutionalization (psychology)|institutionalized]]" threatened the President in order to stay in prison; there was a case in which a state prisoner threatened the President because he wanted to go to a federal institution. <ref>{{cite court|url=http://openjurist.org/6/f3d/1502/united-states-v-ballard|litigants=U.S. v.

==Penalties==. 
Threatening the President of the United States is a [[classes of offenses under United States federal law|class D felony]] under [[United States Code]] Title 18, Section 871. <ref name=EightSeventyOne>{{USC|18|871}}</ref><ref>{{uscsub|18|3559|a|4}}</ref> The offense is punishable by five years in [[federal prison|prison]],<ref name=EightSeventyOne/> a $250,000 fine,<ref>{{uscsub|18|3571|b|3}}</ref> a $100 [[Special assessment on convicted persons|special assessment]],<ref>{{uscsub|18|3013|a|2|A}}</ref> and 3 years of [[supervised release]]. <ref>{{uscsub|18|3583|b|2}}</ref> [[Internet restrictions as conditions of supervised release under United States federal law|Internet restrictions]] such as a prohibition on access to email have been imposed on offenders who made their threats by computer. The [[U.S. Sentencing Guidelines]] set a base offense level of 12 for sending threatening communication, but when a threat to the President is involved, a 6-level "official victim" enhancement applies. Moreover, "an upward departure may be warranted due to the potential disruption of the governmental function."<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.ussc.gov/2009guid/3a1_2.htm|title=U.S.S.G. §3A1.2}}</ref> Further enhancements can apply if the offender evidenced an intent to carry out the threat (6-level enhancement); made more than two threats (2-level enhancement); caused substantial disruption of public, governmental, or business functions or services (4-level enhancement); or created a substantial risk of inciting others to harm federal officials (2-level enhancement). <ref>{{citation|url=http://www.ussc.gov/2009guid/2a6_1.htm|title=U.S.S.G. §2A6.1}}</ref> Since each 6-level increase approximately doubles the Guidelines sentencing range, it is not particularly rare for an offender who threatens the President to receive a sentence at or near the maximum, especially if he has a criminal history and/or does not qualify for a reduction for [[acceptance of responsibility]]. There is a 4-level decrease available for a threat involving a "single instance evidencing little or no deliberation", which would usually apply to spur-of-the-moment verbal threats. The maximum penalty for [[Threatening government officials of the United States|threatening a United States judge or a Federal law enforcement officer]] is 10 years imprisonment &mdash; double the maximum penalty for threatening the President. <ref>{{uscsub|18|876|c}}</ref> . 

==Interpretation==. 
There has been some controversy among the federal appellate courts as to how the term "willfully" should be interpreted. Traditional legal interpretations of the term are reflected by ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]''{{'}}s definition, which includes descriptions such as "malicious, done with evil intent, or with a bad motive or purpose." In ''U.s. v. Patillo'', the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] held that a threat to the President could lead to a verdict of guilty "only if made with the present intention to do injury to the President". <ref name=Time>{{citation|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902726,00.html#ixzz0fCUVB1Yf|title=The Law: Threatening the President|publisher=Time|date=Sep. 07, 1970}}</ref><ref name=Patillo>{{cite court|litigants=U.S. v. Patillo|vol=438|reporter=F2d|court=CA4|year=1971|opinion=13|url=http://openjurist.org/438/f2d/13}}</ref> Specifically, the court opined that "The word [willfully] often denotes an act which is intentional, or knowing, or voluntary, as distinguished from accidental. But when used in a criminal statute it generally means an act done with a bad purpose...We believe that a 'bad purpose' assumes even more than its usual importance in a criminal prosecution based upon the bare utterance of words."<ref>{{cite court|litigants=U.S. v. Patillo|vol=431|reporter=F.2d|opinion=293|url=http://openjurist.org/431/f2d/293}}</ref> . 

Most of the other circuits have held that it is not necessary that the threat be intended to be communicated to the President or that it have tendency to influence his action. <ref name=Stobo>{{cite court|litigants=United States v. Stobo|year=1918|court=DC Del|vol=251|reporter=F|opinion=689|pinpoint=692|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4io4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PR5&dq=federal+reporter+volume+251&lr=&cd=2#v=onepage&q=stobo&f=false|quote=Whatever prior to the passage of the act may have been the essential nature of a criminally punishable threat or its technical significance or description, that act recognizes as punishable an oral as well as a written threat, though not communicated or intended to be communicated to the President. The question whether the threat has a tendency to cause action or non-action on his part is wholly foreign to any proper consideration of a given case. The vital inquiry under the act is whether the threat is of such a nature as to create or tend to create sedition or disloyalty, or to stir up violence toward or resistance to the lawful authority of the President, as commander-in-chief of the army and navy, or as chief executive of the nation.}}</ref> The [[legislative history]], which contains debate over a rejected amendment that would have eliminated the words "knowingly and willfully" from the statute, reflects that the word "willfully" was included in order to avoid criminalizing behavior carried out with innocent intent (e.g. mailing to a friend, for informational purposes, a newspaper article containing a threat to the President). The [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] held that a threat was knowingly made if the maker comprehended the meaning of the words uttered by him. It was willingly made, if in addition to comprehending the meaning of his words, the maker voluntarily and intentionally uttered them as a declaration of apparent determination to carry them into execution. <ref>{{cite court|litigants=Ragansky v. United States|year=1918|court=CA7 Ill|vol=253|reporter=F|opinion=643|pinpoint=645|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kMsKAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR3&dq=federal+reporter+volume+253&lr=&cd=1#v=onepage&q=ragansky&f=false|quote=A threat is knowingly made, if the maker of it comprehends the meaning of the words uttered by him; a foreigner, ignorant of the English language, repeating these same words without knowledge of their meaning, may not knowingly have made a threat. And a threat is willfully made, if in addition to comprehending the meaning of his words, the maker voluntarily and intentionally utters them as the declaration of an apparent determination to carry them into execution.}}</ref> . 

===''Watts v. United States''===. 
In the case of ''Watts v. United States'' (1969), the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that mere political hyperbole must be distinguished from true threats. At a [[W.E.B. DuBois Clubs of America|DuBois Club]] public rally on the [[Washington Monument]] grounds, a member of the assembled group suggested that the young people present should get more education before expressing their views. The defendant, an 18-year-old, replied:
{{cquote|They always holler at us to get an education. And now I have already received my draft classification as 1-A and I have got to report for my physical this Monday coming. I am not going. If they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to get in my sights is [[Lyndon B. Johnson|L. B. J.]]}} . 

According to court testimony, the defendant in speaking made a gesture of sighting down the barrel of a rifle. The audience responded with laughter and applause, which the Court of Appeals would later view as potentially ominous: "[I]t has not been unknown for laughter and applause to have sinister  implications for the safety of others. History records that applause and  laughter frequently greeted [[Hitler]]'s predictions of the future of the German Jews. Even earlier, the Roman holidays celebrated in the  Colosseum often were punctuated by cheers and laughter when the Emperor gestured '[[Pollice verso|thumbs down]]' on a fallen gladiator."<ref name=wattsdc>{{cite court|litigants=Watts v.

The boy was arrested and found to be in possession of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], but a [[Court of General Sessions]] Judge [[suppression of evidence|suppressed]] the cannabis because he found that there had been no probable cause for the Secret Service agents to believe the defendant's words constituted a threat to the President. <ref name=wattsdc/> This did not prevent a federal court from convicting him for threatening the President. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] affirmed his conviction, but the Supreme Court reversed, stating, "We agree with petitioner that his only offense here was 'a kind of very  crude offensive method of stating a political opposition to the  President.' Taken in context, and regarding the expressly conditional  nature of the statement and the reaction of the listeners, we do not see  how it could be interpreted otherwise." In a [[concurring opinion]], [[William O. Douglas]] noted, "The [[Alien and Sedition Laws]] constituted one of our sorriest chapters; and I had thought we had done with them forever ... Suppression of speech as an effective police measure is an old, old device, outlawed by our Constitution."<ref>{{citation|title=Watts v.

Courts have held that a person is guilty of the offense if certain criteria are met. Specifically, he must intentionally make a threat in a context, and under such circumstances, that a reasonable person would foresee that the statement would be interpreted by persons hearing or reading it as a serious expression of an intention to harm the President. The statement must also not be the result of mistake, duress or coercion. <ref>{{cite court|litigants=United States v.

This standard not only takes into account the  factual context in which the statement was made, but also better avoids  the perils that inhere in the "reasonable-recipient standard," namely  that the jury will consider the unique sensitivity of the recipient.}}</ref><ref>{{cite court|litigants=United States v.

The words  knowingly and willfully were intended to signify that the defendant at  the time of making the threat charged against him knew what he was doing  and with that knowledge proceeded in violation of the law to make it.   Thus, a threat is knowingly made if the maker of it comprehends the  meaning of the words uttered by him and it is willfully made if in  addition to comprehending the meaning of the words the maker voluntarily  and intentionally utters them as the declaration of an apparent  determination to carry them into execution.}}</ref><ref>{{cite court|litigants=United States v.

A defendant's statement that if he got the chance he would harm the President is a threat; merely because a threat has been conditional upon the ability of the defendant to carry it out does not render it any less of a threat. <ref name=Jasick>{{cite court|litigants=United States v.

Watts involved a threat made "expressly conditional" on  being drafted into the United States military. Watts, 394 U.S.  at 708, 89 S.Ct. 1399. Miss Lockhart's threat, while grammatically conditional—it begins with the phrase "[i]f George Bush refuses to see  the truth and uphold the Constitution"—does not indicate what events or  circumstances would prevent the threat from being carried out beyond the  broad statement that the President must "see the truth" and "uphold the  Constitution." Likewise, Miss Lockhart did not say or do anything upon  giving the letter to the Food Lion manager that would indicate the  threat was intended to be conditional. Thus, in the context in which it  was delivered, the threat was not "expressly conditional" in nature as  that term is described in Watts.}}</ref> However, the statement "if I got hold of President Wilson, I would shoot him" was not an indictable offense because the conditional threat was ambiguous as to whether it was an expression of present or past intent. <ref>{{cite court|litigants=United States v.

The posting of a paper in a public place with a statement that it would be an acceptable sacrifice to God to kill an unjust President was ruled not to be in violation of the statute. <ref>{{cite court|litigants=United States v.

Since other statutes make it a crime to assault or to attempt to kill the President, some question has arisen as to whether it is necessary to have a statute banning threats. As the ''[[Georgetown Law Journal]]'' notes, "It can be argued that the punishment of an attempt against the life of the President is not sufficient; by the time all the elements of an attempt have come into existence the risk to the President becomes too great. On the other hand, the punishment of conduct short of an attempt runs the risk of violating the established principle that intent alone is not punishable ... While ordinarily mere preparation to commit an offense is not punishable, an exception may perhaps be justified by the seriousness of the consequences of an executed threat on the President's life."<ref name=Comment>Comment, Threatening the President: Protected Dissenter or Potential Assassin, 57 Geo. L.J. 553 (1969)</ref> . 

==Psychiatric matters==. 
According to the U.S. Attorney's Manual, "Of the individuals who come to the Secret Service's attention as creating a possible danger to one of their protectees, approximately 75 percent are mentally ill."<ref name=USAM/> The Secret Service notes, "These are probably Secret Service's most serious cases because it must be determined whether the person making the threat really wants to hurt [Secret Service protectees] or whether they may have some medical problems of their own, for which they need help."<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.secretservice.gov/kids_faq.shtml|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=U.S. Secret Service}}</ref> It is not uncommon for judges to order psychological evaluations of defendants charged under this statute in accordance with [[United States federal laws governing offenders with mental diseases or defects]]. Psychiatrists divide people who threaten the President into three classes: Class 1 includes persons who have expressed overt threatening statements but have made no overt action, Class 2 comprises individuals who have a history of assaultive behaviors toward authority figures, and Class 3 includes person who are considered dangerous and typically have been prosecuted under Section 871. <ref>{{citation|url=http://psychservices.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/56/8/1017|title=Assessment and Management of Patients Who Make Threats Against the President in the Psychiatric Emergency Service|author=Brook Zitek, D.O., Roya Lewis, M.D., John O'Donnell, J.D. and William R.

Dilemmas related to patient confidentiality sometimes arise when a mentally ill subject makes a threat against the President. The termination of nurse Linda Portnoy was upheld after she reported such a statement to the Secret Service. The court noted that the patient was restrained and unable to act on his threats, so he wasn't an immediate safety risk. It also considered the patient's psychiatrist, not Portnoy, the appropriate person to assess the gravity of his threats. <ref>{{citation|url=http://www.nursingcenter.com/library/JournalArticle.asp?Article_ID=762210|title=Reporting Hollow Threats|publisher=Nursing2008|date=January 2008|volume=38|number=1|page=19}}</ref> In a study found that in those who threaten the President, the primary differentiating variable related to lethality was "opportunity and happenstance". <ref>{{citation|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/863349|title=Threats to the President Revisited|publisher=Forensic Sci.|date=1977 May-Jun|pages=173–8}}</ref> Conversely, a defendant's writings in his [[anger management]] workbook threatening to kill the President upon the defendant's release from the penitentiary were ruled to have fallen within the [[dangerous patient]] exception to psychotherapist-patient privilege. <ref>{{cite court|litigants=United States v. Lincoln|year=2003|court=DC Or|reporter=F Supp 2d|opinion=1169}}</ref> . 

Federal law provides that the director of the facility in which a person is hospitalized due to being found [[incompetent to stand trial]] or [[not guilty only by reason of insanity]] of a Section 871 violation shall prepare annual or semiannual reports concerning the mental condition of the person and containing recommendations about the need for his continued hospitalization; a copy of the reports shall be submitted to the Director of the United States Secret Service to assist it in carrying out its protective duties. <ref>{{uscsub|18|4247|e}}</ref> The Ninth Circuit ruled that it is constitutional to hold a presidential threatener beyond Section 871's prescribed five year statutory maximum if he is found to be dangerous and mentally ill. It is possible under federal law to hold some presidential threateners indefinitely. <ref>{{cite court|url=http://openjurist.org/56/f3d/1026|vol=56|reporter=F.3d|opinion=1026|court=9th Cir.|date=May 26, 1995|litigants=U.S. v.
