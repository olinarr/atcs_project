{{Censorship by country}}
[[Censorship]] in the [[United Kingdom]] has a long history with variously stringent and lax laws in place at different times. Censorship of motion pictures, video games and Internet sites hosted in the United Kingdom are considered to be among the strictest in the European Union with the strictest being Germany.  . 

==Ministry of Information==. 
The [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] was created during the [[World War I|First World War]] and then reformed for the [[Second World War]] for propaganda purposes. In the Second World War it was located at the [[Senate House (University of London)|Senate House]] of the [[University of London]]. During the First World War it was infamous for having a staff of 999.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} . 

The Ministry was responsible for keeping much information out of the public domain during the war years, as it was thought that this would have been harmful to the national sentiment. It also censored many press reports that were not deemed to be sufficiently patriotic, or that listed military operations to a level of detail that could be used by the enemy.  . 

The Ministry took over the General Post Office Film Unit, renaming it the Crown Film Unit. It produced documentaries such as ''[[Target for Tonight]]'' (1941), ''Western Approaches'' (1944) and ''[[London Can Take It!]]'' (1940). It also created a feature-length fictional film; ''[[49th Parallel (film)|49th Parallel]]'' (1941). Following this it solely created documentaries, although it also laid down propaganda guidelines for commercial films.  . 

The Ministry was disbanded following the end of the [[Second World War]].  <!-- [[J.StuartClarke]] --> . 

==Laws on obscenity and sexual content==. 
[[Obscenity]] law in [[England]] and [[Wales]] is currently governed by the various [[Obscene Publications Act]]s, and [[Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]] but obscenity laws go back much further into the [[English common law]].  . 

The conviction in 1727 of [[Edmund Curll]] for the publication of ''[[Venus in the Cloister|Venus in the Cloister or The Nun in her Smock]]'' under the [[common law]] offence of [[disturbing the peace|disturbing the]] [[Queen's peace|King's peace]] was the first conviction for obscenity in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], and set a [[legal precedent]] for other convictions. <ref>"[http://www.eroticabibliophile.com/censorship_history.html The Obscenity of Censorship: A History of Indecent People and Lacivious Publications]", The Erotica Bibliophile. Retrieved 29 May 2006. </ref> . 

A defence against the charge of obscenity on the grounds of [[literary merit]] was introduced in the [[Obscene Publications Act 1959]]. The OPA was tested in the high-profile obscenity trial brought against [[Penguin Books]] for publishing ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' (by [[D. H. Lawrence]]) in 1960. The book was found to have merit, and Penguin Books was found not guilty &mdash; a ruling which granted far more freedom to publish explicit material. <ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/10/newsid_2965000/2965194.stm  1960: Lady Chatterley's Lover sold out]", BBC News. Retrieved 29 May 2006. </ref> This trial did not establish the 'merit' defence as an automatic right; several controversial books and publications were the subject of British court cases throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s. ''[[Last Exit to Brooklyn]]'', a 1964 novel by [[United States|American]] author [[Hubert Selby, Jr.]] was subject of a private prosecution in 1966.  . 

There is a substantial overlap between legal [[erotic literature]] and illegal [[pornography]], with the distinction traditionally made in the English-speaking courts on the basis of perceived [[literary merit]]. Purely textual pornography has not been prosecuted since the ''[[Linda Lovelace|Inside Linda Lovelace]]'' trial of 1976. <ref>"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A679016 The Obscene Publications Act, 1857]", BBC, 30 January 2002.

Almost all [[adult stores]] in the UK are forbidden from having their goods in open display under the [[Indecent Displays Act 1981]], which means the shop fronts are often boarded up or covered in posters. A warning sign must be clearly shown at the entrance to the store, and no items can be visible from the street. No customer can be under eighteen years old. The [[Video Recordings Act 1984]] introduced the [[R18-rated]] classification for videos that are only available in licensed sex shops, but hardcore pornographic magazines are available in newsagents in some places. The [[Ann Summers]] chain of [[lingerie]] and sex shops recently won the right to advertise for workers in [[job centres]], which was originally banned under restrictions on what advertising could be carried out by the [[sex industry]]. <ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2999892.stm Sex toys chain wins legal fight]", BBC News, 18 June 2003.

==Stage Licensing Act of 1737==. 
{{Main|Licensing Act 1737}} . 

In 1737, partly as a result of political attacks by [[Henry Fielding]] against [[Robert Walpole]], Parliament enacted a law that established "the Examiner of the Stage" to censure plays on the basis of both politics and morals (''i.e.'' sexual impropriety, blasphemy, and foul language). Plays had to be licensed by the [[Lord Chamberlain]]. In 1737, through the influence of the [[Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton|Duke of Grafton]], the Shakespearian commentator [[Edward Capell]] was appointed with an annual salary of £200 as deputy-examiner of plays. This censorship by licensing requirement was abolished by the [[Theatres Act 1968]].  . 

According to [[Rufus Osgood Mason]] (who gives an example of a written license from 1814): . 

[[Charles Kemble]], later in life, received the appointment of "Examiner of Plays." The duties consisted in reading the plays which had been accepted by the managers of the different theatres, to see that they contained nothing objectionable either on the score of politics or morals. Those that were approved were reported to the Lord Chamberlain who issued the license. <ref>{{cite book|title=Sketches and impressions, musical, theatrical and social, 1795–1885|chapter=Charles Kemble|author=Mason, Rufus Osgood|year=1887|pages=45–46|location=NY|publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=C340AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA45}}</ref> . 

==Libel law==. 
{{Main|English defamation law}} . 

England and Wales have relatively strict [[libel]] laws ("[[defamation]]" in [[Scotland]]) in that they are often considered pro plaintiff with the defendant asked to prove that they did not commit libel. Compensation awards for libel are also unlimited, in contrast to those for personal injury. Further controversy surrounds the libel laws with regard to costs. Whilst costs can be awarded the ability both to bring and to defend libel cases is often considered to be restricted to the wealthy. Conversely it is possible to initiate a "no win – no fee" case against a wealthy individual or organisation if the individual bringing the case has insignificant assets as even if the case is lost the wealthy individual or organisation are unable to recover their costs. Typically in such cases an out of court settlement is forced upon the wealthy individual or organisation.  . 

A recent example is the case of [[Simon Singh#Chiropractic lawsuit|Simon Singh's lawsuit]], where author and journalist Simon Singh was sued by the [[British Chiropractic Association]] for criticism of [[chiropractic therapy]] which rested on a summary of recent scientific research. Singh has been able to pursue a legal defence because of his earnings from four bestsellers.  . 

In another case the UK based academic publisher Equinox was forced to remove a peer reviewed academic article from its publication International Journal of Speech Language and the Law. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equinoxjournals.com/ojs/index.php/IJSLL/index |title=International Journal of Speech Language and the Law |publisher=Equinoxjournals.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref> The article "charlatanry in forensic speech science" was a metastudy of lie detector research and came to the conclusion that lie detectors don't work. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://equinoxjournals.com/ojs/index.php/IJSLL/article/viewArticle/3775 |title=Charlantry in forensic speech science: A problem to be taken seriously &#124; Eriksson &#124; International Journal of Speech Language and the Law |publisher=Equinoxjournals.com |date=2008-12-04 |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref> The Israeli manufacturer of lie detectors [[Nemesysco]] forced the publisher to remove the already published article from the online databases and the journal was also forced to publish an apology in a later issue. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/17188/20090127/ |title=Threats over Swedish lie detector research - The Local |publisher=Thelocal.se |date= |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Kristina Jogestrand |url=http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1298&a=877743 |title=Forskare hotas av åtal |language={{sv icon}} |publisher=DN.se |date=2010-11-30 |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=597&a=868300 |title=Lögndetektorer fungerar inte |language={{sv icon}} |publisher=DN.se |date=2008-12-28 |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref> . 

On 15 March 2011, a “Draft [[Defamation]] Bill” (CP3/11) was published by the [[Ministry of Justice]] with an accompanying “consultation paper containing provisions for reforming the law to strike the right balance between protection of [[freedom of speech]] and protection of reputation.” (Close date: 10 June 2011) <ref>Draft Defamation Bill: http://www.justice.gov.uk/consultations/draft-defamation-bill.htm</ref> . 

==Blasphemy law==. 
{{Main|Blasphemy law in the United Kingdom}}
Blasphemy against [[Christianity]] was long an important part of British censorship, with the unwritten [[common law]] containing an offence of [[blasphemous libel]]. Prosecutions were rare, however, the last one being the 1977 ''[[Gay News]]'' legal case ''[[Whitehouse v. Lemon]]''.  Later developments around the turn of the 21st century put the continued viability of blasphemy prosecutions in doubt. <ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3753408.stm Q & A: Blasphemy law]", BBC News, 18 October 2004.

==Prior restraint==. 
Beyond obscenity law, there have been a number of organizations whose main function was to approve material prior to distribution.  . 

Plays and theatres had long been licensed by the Crown prior to 1737. Licensure of a playhouse, however, only gave a general patent. The crown had no ability to censor before plays were performed. Under the provisions of the [[Licensing Act|Theatrical Licensing Act of 1737]] as extended by the [[Theatres Act 1843]], the [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]] was able to censor plays. This role continued until the [[Theatres Act 1968]] abolished the practice following several [[cause célèbre]]s, and a long campaign by the theatre critic [[Kenneth Tynan]] among others.  . 

The [[British Board of Film Classification]] is the ''de facto'' film censor for films in the United Kingdom;<ref>[http://www.bbfc.co.uk/ British Board of Film Classification], British Board of Film Classification. Retrieved 29 May 2006. </ref> since films not rated by the BBFC cannot be shown in most cinemas, or distributed as videos or DVDs, lack of BBFC approval generally makes productions of such films uneconomic. 
*In the case of films shown in cinemas, local authorities have the final legal say about who can watch a particular film. Almost always local authorities accept the Board's recommendation for a certificate for a film. 
*Under the [[Video Recording Act 1984]], almost all video recordings must be classified by an authority chosen by the Home Secretary. This classification is then legally binding. Since the introduction of the Act, the BBFC has been the chosen authority. Certain works such as those that are related to sport, religion or which are designed to educate can be exempt from classification by the BBFC under the act.  . 

The [[Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre]] pre-approves most British television advertising<ref>[http://www.bacc.org.uk/bacc Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre], Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre. Retrieved 29 May 2006. </ref> (under [[Ofcom]] rules, other broadcasters can also approve their own advertising content, but most rely on the BACC). The [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] is the regulatory advertising body, but can only prevent the republication of advertisements after upholding complaints from the general public.  . 

The advent of the [[Internet]] access has made the act of censorship more difficult, and there has been a relaxation of censorship in recognition of this. BBFC guidelines have been relaxed further to allow the limited distribution of [[hardcore pornography]] under an [[R18 certificate]], partially because of this, and partially because of a recognition that public attitudes have changed. Further confirmation of this change in attitude was provided by the French film ''[[Baise-moi]]'', which was given an 18 certificate despite showing scenes of unsimulated sexual activity.  . 

[[Ofcom]] is now the regulatory body for UK television, radio, and telecommunications services since the abolition of the [[Independent Television Commission]]. <ref>[http://www.ofcom.org.uk/ Ofcom], Ofcom. Retrieved 29 May 2006. </ref> Ofcom exerts its powers under the [[Communications Act 2003]]. The government's new requirements for Ofcom only require it to ensure adherence to "generally accepted standards" and prevention of harm, removing the former requirement to adhere to standards of "taste and decency".  . 

''[[Press Freedom Index|Worldwide Press Freedom Index]]'', published by [[Reporters Without Borders]], gave the United Kingdom a score of 5.17, making it 24th. <ref>"[http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=554 Worldwide Press Freedom Index 2005]", Reporters Without Borders, 2005. Retrieved 31 May 2006. </ref> . 

==Self-regulation of publication==. 
A number of industries carry out what is known as [[Self-policing|self-regulation]]. Self-regulation seeks to keep content within the bounds of what is publicly acceptable, thus preventing government intervention to bring about official regulation. Some of the areas they are concerned about include obscenity, [[slander]] and [[libel]]. There is no clear line between self-regulation in matters of expression and [[self-censorship]].  . 

Industry self-regulatory bodies include the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] and the [[Press Complaints Commission]].  . 

==Video game censorship==. 
The introduction of controversial games featuring photo-realistic images, such as ''[[Mortal Kombat (video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' and ''[[Night Trap]]'', led to calls from the tabloid press for games to fall under the [[Video Recordings Act 1984|Video Recordings Act]]. The UK games publisher trade body [[Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association|ELSPA]] responded by introducing a voluntary age rating system in 1994. The ELSPA ratings were succeeded by [[Pan European Game Information|PEGI]] in 2003.  . 

Nevertheless, although games are generally exempt from the Video Recordings Act, those depicting sexual content, or gross violence towards people or animals, must still be submitted to the [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]] for consideration. BBFC ratings are legally binding, and British law imposes stiff penalties on retailers who sell to under-aged customers. However, the Act was discovered in August 2009 to be unenforceable. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8219438.stm Loophole over DVD age rating law], BBC News, 25 August 2009</ref> The rating system is to be reviewed as part of the [[Digital Britain]] project. <ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8103351.stm|title= At a glance: Digital Britain|publisher= BBC News|date= 16 June 2009|accessdate= 20 June 2009 | location=London}}</ref> . 

''[[Carmageddon]]'', in which the gameplay involved mowing down innocent pedestrians, was the first game to be refused classification in 1997, effectively banning it. <ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/21836.stm Carmageddon smashes British censor ban]", BBC News, 4 November 1997. Retrieved 31 May 2006. </ref> The game's publisher, [[SCI]], had a modified version created in which the pedestrians in question were replaced by green-blooded zombies, which completed a successful appeal against the BBFC to overturn their original decision. The uncensored, unmodified version of ''Carmageddon'' was later released under an 18-certificate.  . 

In 2002 the [[Io Interactive]] game ''[[Hitman 2: Silent Assassin]]'' was withdrawn by a number of retailers due to religious sensitivities. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/sci_tech/newsid_2500000/2500199.stm | work=BBC News | title=Shops take Hitman 2 game off the shelves | date=21 November 2002 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> The area in question involved a [[Sikh]] sect that were depicted as terrorists involved in arms smuggling and assassination.

It was later found not to be, as the game was found in the victim's home, rather than the killer's. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/leicestershire/3934277.stm | work=BBC News | title=Game blamed for hammer murder | date=29 July 2004 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> Leicestershire police "did not uncover any connections to the computer game."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/leicestershire/3538066.stm | work=BBC News | title=Police reject game link to murder | date=5 August 2004 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref>  The accusations prompted some retailers to remove the game from their shelves. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/leicestershire/3936597.stm | work=BBC News | title=Manhunt game withdrawn by stores | date=29 July 2004 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref>  Nevertheless, following this incident the sales of the game rose due to the free publicity from newspaper headlines.

The game is now available.  . 

In June 2007 the [[PlayStation 3]] game ''[[Resistance: Fall of Man]]'' was criticized for the use of [[Manchester]] cathedral as one of the games' backdrops. Sony, the publisher of the game, responded by saying "Sony Computer Entertainment Europe is aware of the concerns expressed by the Bishop of Manchester and the cathedral authorities... and we naturally take the concerns very seriously. ''Resistance: Fall of Man'' is a fantasy science fiction game and is not based on reality. We believe we have sought and received all permissions necessary for the creation of the game."
However it's not illegal to buy a game that is over the age range with the parents/guardians permission {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} .

This necessitated the use by broadcasters of an actor 'revoicing' the words which had been spoken by interviewees or at public meetings by the affected groups. The case of the unmade ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]'' in 1988 with [[Gerry Adams]] is also relevant: see [[After Dark (TV series)#Gerry Adams]]. The ban was lifted a fortnight after the first [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] ceasefire, on 16 September 1994. The ban could not be enforced for the duration of election campaigns.  . 

===Radio===. 
Censorship of music on the airwaves was in effect the power of the BBC. A full list of songs banned on the BBC can be seen here [[List of songs banned by the BBC]]. Some songs were banned for containing sexually explicit lyrics, or promoting the use of drugs. Some songs were banned for political reasons such as [[Paul McCartney]] and Wings song ''[[Give Ireland Back to the Irish]]'' in the 1970s, or in the 1980s [[Christy Moore]]'s, ''Back home in Derry'' since it was written by [[Bobby Sands]]. <ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/bobby-sands-celtic-artist Bobby Sands Celtic Artist]</ref> .

*In 1873, controversy over the depiction of [[William Ewart Gladstone]], [[Robert Lowe, 1st Viscount Sherbrooke]], and [[Acton Smee Ayrton]] in [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Gilbert Arthur à Beckett]]'s ''[[The Happy Land]]'' led to the play's licence being revoked by the [[Lord Chamberlain]]. A censored version of the play was eventually allowed to be performed, but uncensored scripts, with the censored portions printed in all capital letters, were printed by the theatre's manager. The play became a smash hit. <ref name=Meisel>Joseph S Meisel (1999), ''[http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-229X.00109 The Importance of Being Serious: The Unexplored Connection between Gladstone and Humour]'', History 84 (274), p. 278–300. doi:10.1111/1468-229X.00109</ref><ref name=ILN>[[The Illustrated London News]], March 15, 1873, page 243</ref>

==George Orwell==. 
[[George Orwell]] wrote several articles on [[censorship]] including an item titled ''The Freedom of the Press'' in 1943. It appears that this was a preface for his book ''[[Animal Farm]]'', but it is unclear if it had been deliberately suppressed or if Orwell himself chose not to publish it.  . 

<blockquote>Any fair-minded person with journalistic experience will admit that during this war official censorship has not been particularly irksome. We have not been subjected to the kind of totalitarian ‘co-ordination’ that it might have been reasonable to expect. The press has some justified grievances, but on the whole the Government has behaved well and has been surprisingly tolerant of minority opinions. The sinister fact about literary censorship in [[England]] is that it is largely voluntary. &ndash; George Orwell<ref>George Orwell, 1945. "The Freedom of the Press". ''The Times'', 1972 and ''Animal Farm'', Penguin 2000. "[http://orwell.ru/library/novels/Animal_Farm/english/efp_go The Freedom of the Press]". Retrieved 19 May 2006. </ref></blockquote> . 

Orwell went on to suggest that because both the UK and the [[Soviet Union]] were members of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] at the time, this self-censorship was preventing valid criticism of the Communist regime. Orwell worked for the Ministry of Information during the war and used it as his inspiration for the [[Ministry of Truth]] in ''[[Nineteen-Eighty-Four]]''.  .
