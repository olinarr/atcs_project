'''Freedom of information''' (or '''information freedom''') refers to the protection of the right to [[freedom of expression]] with regard to the [[Internet]] and [[information technology]] (see also, [[digital rights]]). Freedom of information may also concern [[censorship]] in an information technology context, i.e. the ability to access [[Web content]], without [[censorship]] or restrictions.  . 

Freedom of information is an extension of [[freedom of speech]], a fundamental [[human right]] recognised in [[international human rights law|international law]], which is today understood more generally  as [[freedom of expression]] in any medium, be it orally, in writing, print, through the [[Internet]] or through art forms. This means that the protection of freedom of speech as a right includes not only the content, but also the means of expression. <ref>Andrew Puddephatt, Freedom of Expression, The essentials of Human Rights, Hodder Arnold, 2005, pg.128</ref> Freedom of information may also refer to the [[right to privacy]] in the context of the [[Internet]] and [[information technology]]. As with the right to freedom of expression, the [[right to privacy]] is a recognised [[human right]] and freedom of information acts as an extension to this right. <ref name=autogenerated2>[http://freenetproject.org/papers/freenet-ieee.pdf Protecting Free Expression Online with Freenet - Internet Computing, IEEE<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Lastly, freedom of information can include opposition to [[patents]], [[copyrights]] or [[intellectual property]] in general. <ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://somerandomnerd.com/node/647|title=Freedom of Information vs. Protection of Intellectual Property}}</ref> The [[Pirate_Parties_International|international]] and [[United States Pirate Party]] have established political platforms based largely on freedom of information issues. <ref>{{Cite journal|title=Avast Network, What is the Pirate Party—and why is it helping Wikileaks?|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/world/81963/pirate-party-wikileaks}}</ref> . 

==Freedom of information legislation==. 
{{Main|Freedom of information legislation}}
Private bodies started to perform functions which were previously carried out by public bodies. Privatisation and de-regulation saw banks, telecommunications companies, hospitals and universities being run by private entities, leading to demands for the extension of freedom of information legislation to cover private bodies. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=222|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}</ref> In June 2006 nearly 70 countries had freedom of information legislations applying to information held by government bodies and in certain circumstances to private bodies. In 19 of these countries the freedom of information legislation also applied to private bodies. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=211 & 223|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}</ref> Access to information was increasingly recognised as a prerequisite for transparency and accountability of governments, as a facilitating consumers' ability to make informed choices, and as safeguarding citizens against mismanagement and corruption. This has led an increasing number of countries to enact freedom of information legislation in the past 10 years. <ref name="Mazhar Siraj 2010 213">{{Cite journal|last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=213|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}</ref> . 

=== Government bodies ===. 
As of 2006 70 countries had comprehensive freedom of information legislation for public bodies, nearly half of which had been enacted in the past 10 years. Such legislation was pending in a further 50 countries. <ref name="Mazhar Siraj 2010 213"/> . 

=== Private bodies ===. 
As of 2006, the following 19 countries had freedom of information legislation that extended to government bodies and private bodies: [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Angola]], [[Armenia]], [[Colombia]], the [[Czech Republic]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Panama]], [[Poland]], [[Peru]], [[South Africa]], [[Turkey]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Slovakia]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. The degree to which private bodies are covered under freedom of information legislation varies, in Angola, Armenia and Peru the legislation only applies to private companies that perform what are considered to be public functions. In the Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, Finland, Trinidad and Tobago, Slovakia, Poland and Iceland private bodies that receive public funding are subject to freedom of information legislation. Freedom of information legislation in Estonia, France and UK covers private bodies in certain sectors. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=223|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}</ref> In South Africa the access provisions of the Promotion of Access to Information Act have been used by individuals to establish why their loan application has been denied. The access provisions have also been used by minority shareholders in private companies and environmental groups, who were seeking information on the potential environmental damage caused by company projects. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=223–224|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}</ref> . 

==== Consumer protection ====. 
In 1983 the [[United Nations Commission on Transnational Corporations]] adopted the [[United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection]] stipulating eight consumer rights, including "consumer access to adequate information to enable making informed choices according to individual wishes and needs". Access to information became to be regarded as basic consumer right and preventative disclosure, i.e. the disclosure of information on threats to human lives, health and safety began to be emphasised. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=216|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}</ref> . 

==== Investors ====. 
Secretive decision making by company directors and corporate scandal led to freedom of information legislation to be published for the benefits of investors. Such legislation was first adopted in Britain in the early 20th century, and later in North America and other countries. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=216–217|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}</ref> Disclosure regimes for the benefit of investors regained attention at the beginning of the 21st century as a number of corporate scandals were linked to accountancy fraud and company director secrecy. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=219|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}</ref> Starting with Enron, the subsequent scandals involving [[Worldcom]], [[Tyco International|Tyco]], [[Adelphia Communications Corporation|Adelphia]] and [[Global Crossing]] prompted the [[US Congress]] to impose new information disclosure obligations on companies with the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] 2002. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=220|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}</ref> . 

== The Information Society and freedom of expression ==. 
The [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS) Declaration of Principles adopted in 2003 reaffirms [[democracy]] and the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of all [[human rights]] and fundamental freedoms. The Declaration also makes specific reference to the importance of the right to [[freedom of expression]] for the "[[information society|Information Society]]" in stating:
<blockquote>
"We reaffirm, as an essential foundation of the [[information society|Information Society]], and as outlined in Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], that everyone has the right to [[Freedom of speech|freedom of opinion and expression]]; that this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. Communication is a fundamental social process, a basic human need and the foundation of all social organisation. It is central to the Information Society. Everyone, everywhere should have the opportunity to participate and no one should be excluded from the benefits the Information Society offers."<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Klang | first1 = Mathias| last2 = Murray| first2 = Andrew| title = Human Rights in the Digital Age | year = 2005| url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=USksfqPjwhUC&dq=%22digital+rights%22+human+rights&cad=0| publisher = Routledge |page=1 }}</ref>  
</blockquote>
The 2004 WSIS Declaration of Principles also acknowledged that "it is necessary to prevent the use of information resources and technologies for criminal and terrorist purposes, while respecting human rights."<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Klang | first1 = Mathias| last2 = Murray| first2 = Andrew| title = Human Rights in the Digital Age | year = 2005| url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=USksfqPjwhUC&dq=%22digital+rights%22+human+rights&cad=0| publisher = Routledge |page=2 }}</ref> Wolfgang Benedek comments that the WSIS Declaration only contains a number of references to human rights and does not spell out any procedures or mechanism to assure that human rights are considered in practice. <ref>{{cite book |title=Internet Governance and the Information Society |last=Benedek |first=Wolfgang |coauthors=Veronika  Bauer, Matthias Kettemann |year=2008 |publisher= Eleven International Publishing |location= |isbn=9077596569, 9789077596562 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ie7Yqiw85TcC&vq=%22Internet+Bill+of+rights%22&dq=%22digital+rights%22+%22human+rights%22&cad=0 |page=36 }}</ref> . 

== Hacktivismo ==. 
{{main|Hacktivismo}}
The [[digital rights]] group [[Hacktivismo]], founded in 1999, argues that access to information is a basic [[human right]]. The group's beliefs are described fully in the "Hacktivismo Declaration" which calls for the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) to be applied to the [[Internet]]. The Declaration recalls the duty of member states to the ICCPR to protect the right to [[freedom of expression]] with regard to the internet and in this context freedom of information. <ref name=autogenerated1>http://www.cultdeadcow.com/cDc_files/declaration.html</ref> The Hacktivismo Declaration recognises "the importance to fight against human rights abuses with respect to reasonable access to information on the Internet" and calls upon the [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]] community to "study ways and means of circumventing state sponsored [[censorship]] of the internet" and "implement technologies to challenge information rights violations". The Hacktivismo Declaration does however recognise that the right to [[freedom of expression]] is subject to limitations, stating "we recognised the right of governments to forbid the publication of properly categorized [[state secrets]], [[child pornography]], and matters related to personal [[privacy]] and [[privilege]], among other accepted restrictions." However, the Hacktivismo Declaration states "but we oppose the use of state power to control access to the works of critics, [[intellectuals]], [[artists]], or religious figures."<ref name=autogenerated1 /> . 

== Global Network Initiative ==. 
On October 29, 2008 the Global Network Initiative (GNI) was founded upon its "Principles on Freedom of Expression and Privacy". The Initiative was launched in the 60th Anniversary year of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and is based on internationally recognized laws and standards for [[human rights]] on [[freedom of expression]] and [[privacy]] set out in the UDHR, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR). <ref>[http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/faq/index.php Global Network Initiative, FAQ]</ref> Participants in the Initiative include the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Yahoo]], other major companies, human rights NGOs, investors, and academics. <ref>[http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/10/29/global20097.htm Internet Rights Protection Initiative Launches]
</ref><ref>[http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/participants/index.php Global Network Initiative, Participants]</ref> . 

According to reports [[Cisco Systems]] was invited to the initial discussions but didn't take part in the initiative. [[Harrington Investments]], which proposed that Cisco establish a human rights board, has dismissed the GNI as a voluntary code of conduct not having any impact. Chief executive John Harrington called the GNI "meaningless noise" and instead calls for bylaws to be introduced that force boards of directors to accept human rights responsibilities. <ref name="Glanville">{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/nov/17/censorship-internet |title=The big business of net censorship |last=Glanville  |first=Jo |date=17 November 2008 |publisher= The Guardian | location=London}}</ref> . 

== Internet censorship ==. 
<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Internet police officer chacha.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Internet [[police officer]] [[Jingjing and Chacha|Chacha]], one of the [[cartoon]] [[mascots]] of the Internet Surveillance Division of the Public Security Bureau in [[Shenzhen]], [[China]].]] -->
{{main|Internet censorship}}
Jo Glanville, editor of the [[Index on Censorship]], states that "the internet has been a revolution for censorship as much as for free speech". <ref name="Glanville"/> The concept of freedom of information has emerged in response to state sponsored censorship, monitoring and surveillance of the internet. Internet censorship includes the control or suppression of the publishing or accessing of information on the [[Internet]]. 
<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Iran Web screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|A screenshot of a blocked website in Iran.]] --> . 

According to the [[Reporters without Borders]] (RSF) "internet enemy list" the following states engage in pervasive internet censorship: [[Cuba]], [[Iran]], [[Maldives]], [[Myanmar]]/[[Burma]], [[North Korea]], [[Syria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Vietnam]]. <ref>[http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=19603 List of the 13 Internet enemies] RSF, 2006 November</ref> A widely publicised example is the '''[[Great Firewall of China]]''' (in reference both to its role as a [[firewall (networking)|network firewall]] and to the ancient [[Great Wall of China]]). The system blocks content by preventing [[IP address]]es from being routed through and consists of standard firewall and [[proxy server]]s at the [[Internet]] [[gateway (telecommunications)|gateway]]s. The system also selectively engages in [[DNS poisoning]] when particular sites are requested. The government does not appear to be systematically examining Internet content, as this appears to be technically impractical. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/china/story/0,,1713317,00.html|title=War of the words |publisher=[[The Guardian]] | location=London | first=Jonathan | last=Watts | date=2006-02-20 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China]] is conducted under a wide variety of laws and administrative regulations. In accordance with these laws, more than sixty Internet regulations have been made by the People's Republic of China (PRC) government, and censorship systems are vigorously implemented by provincial branches of state-owned [[Internet service provider|ISP]]s, business companies, and organizations. <ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/china0806/3.htm|title= II.

In 2010 [[Hillary Clinton]], speaking on behalf of the [[United States]], declared 'we stand for a single internet where all of humanity has equal access to knowledge and ideas'.  In her 'Remarks on Internet Freedom' she also draws attention to how 'even in authoritarian countries, information networks are helping people discover new facts and making governments more accountable', while reporting President [[Barack Obama]]'s pronouncement 'the more freely information flows, the stronger societies become'. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/01/135519.htm |title=Remarks on Internet Freedom |publisher=US Department of State website |accessdate=December 18, 2010}}</ref> .
