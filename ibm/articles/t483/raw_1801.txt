{{censorship by country}}
'''Censorship in the People's Republic of China''' (PRC) is implemented or mandated by the PRC's ruling party, the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC). Notable censored subjects include but are not limited to, democracy, the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], [[Falun Gong]], ethnic independence movements, corruption, [[police brutality]], [[anarchism]], [[Body shape]], [[gossip]], disparity of wealth, [[food safety]], pornography, news sources that report on these issues, religious content, and many other websites. <ref name="subjects ban">{{Cite news|url= http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201003250329.html|title= China bans reporting on 18 subjects |accessdate=28 March 2010 |date= 26 March 2010|author=Minemura, Kenji|work=[[Asahi Shimbun]]}}</ref> . 

Censored media include essentially all capable of reaching a wide audience including television, print media, radio, film, theater, [[text messaging]], [[instant messaging]], video games, [[Chinese Literature|literature]] and the [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|Internet]]. Chinese officials have access to uncensored information via an [[Internal media of the People's Republic of China|internal document system]].

==Subject matter and agenda==. 
Censorship in the PRC encompasses a wide range of subject matter. The agendas behind such censorship are varied; some are stated outright by the Chinese government itself and some are surmised by observers inside and out of the country.  . 

According to the ''South China Morning Post'', the Chinese government issues orders on a regular basis to 'guide' coverage of individual sensitive issues. Media organisations thus submit to self-censorship, or run the risk of being closed down. <ref name=scmp20110121>Agence France-Presse (21 January 2011). "Propaganda arm orders pro-party reporting, say rights groups", ''South China Morning Post''</ref> . 

===Political===. 
Censorship in China is largely seen as a measure to maintain the rule of the [[Communist Party of China]]. Censorship helps prevent unapproved [[Reformism|reformist]], [[Separatism|separatist]], "[[counter-revolutionary]]", or religious ideas, peaceful or otherwise, from organizing themselves and spreading. Additionally, censorship prevents Chinese citizens from discovering or learning more about past and current failures of the Communist Party that could create or inflame anti-government sentiment. Measures such as the [[List of websites blocked in the People's Republic of China#Governments and political parties|blocking of foreign governments' websites]] may also be intended to prevent citizens from learning about alternative systems of governance and demanding similar systems.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} . 

In the lead-up to the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympics]], the government allegedly issued guidelines to the local media for reporting during the Games: political issues not directly related to the games were to be downplayed: topics such as Pro-Tibetan independence and [[East Turkestan independence movement|East Turkestan movements]] and food safety issues such as "cancer-causing mineral water" were not to be reported on. <ref>Stephen Hutcheon, [http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/was-chinas-contaminated-milk-scandal-hushed-up/2008/09/15/1221330732015.html Was China's milk scandal hushed up?], [http://www.smh.com.au/news/off-the-field/the-full-list-of-edicts/2008/08/14/1218307066869.html "The full list of edicts"], ''New Zealand Herald'' (15 September 2008)</ref> As the [[2008 Chinese milk scandal]] broke in September 2008, some western media evoked suspicions that China's desire for a perfect games may have been a factor contributing towards the delayed recall of contaminated [[infant formula]],<ref name=Telegraph>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/2963808/China-accused-over-contaminated-baby-milk.html China accused over contaminated baby milk], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (15 September 2008)</ref> which has given more than 50,000 babies [[kidney stones]] and killed at least 4 infants<ref name=toll>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&sid=a4krf9ZOzsh8&refer=asia China Milk Scandal Spreads; Hong Kong Girl Sickened"], [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] (21 September 2008)</ref> although the Central government denied this. <ref name=alerted>Al Guo, "First arrests made in tainted milk scandal", Page A4, ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' (16 September 2008)</ref> . 

On 13 February 2009, Li Dongdong, a deputy chief of the General Administration of Press and Publication, announced the introduction of a series of rules and regulations to strengthen oversight and administration of news professionals and reporting activities. The regulations would include a "full database of people who engage in unhealthy professional conduct" who would be excluded from engaging in news reporting and editing work. Although the controls were ostensibly to "resolutely halt fake news", it was criticized by Li Datong, editor at the ''[[China Youth Daily]]'' who was dismissed for criticizing state censorship. Li Datong said "There really is a problem with fake reporting and reporters, but there are already plenty of ways to deal with that." ''[[Reuters]]'' said that although Communist Party's [[Propaganda in the People's Republic of China|Propaganda Department]] micro-manages what newspapers and other media do and do not report, the government remains concerned about unrest amid the economic slowdown and the 20th anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|pro-democracy protests in 1989]]. <ref>[http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-37996920090213 China to introduce journalist "black list"], [[Reuters]], 13 February 2009</ref> . 

In January 2011, Boxun revealed that Politburo member responsible for the Propaganda Department, Li Changchun, issued instructions for the Chinese media to downplay social tensions on issues such as land prices, political reform and major disasters or incidents, and to ensure reporting does not show the Communist party negatively. The Party warned that media must “ensure that the party and government do not become the targets or focus of criticism”, and any mention of political reforms must reflect the government in a favourable light. <ref name=scmp20110121/> . 

===Moral===. 
Usually, this type of censorship is mainly used to prevent political conflicts from happening within the social environment. Usually, people are allowed to talk about politics on the internet, but certain websites containing anti-government material would be blocked. Some censorship in China has been justified as upholding proper morals. This includes limitations on [[pornography]]<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/08/02/china_porn_crackdown/|title= China terminates 700 sites in porn crackdown|last= Richardson|first= Tim|date= 2 August 2004|work=The Register}}</ref>, particularly extreme pornography, and violence in films. <ref name="pirates">{{Cite news|url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1817089,00.htmlpoooooonaniiii|title= China sinks Dead Man's Chest|date= 10 July 2006|work=The Guardian |location=UK |quote= China passes only 20 foreign films each year for cinematic viewing and does not have a film rating system. | location=London | accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> . 

The PRC (People’s Republic of China) has historically sought to use censorship to protect the country’s culture. During the Cultural Revolution, foreign literature and art forms, religious works and symbols, and even artifacts of ancient Chinese culture were deemed “reactionary” and became targets for destruction by teams of Red Guard. 
Although much greater cultural freedom exists in China today, continuing crackdowns on banning foreign cartoons from Chinese prims time TV, and limits on screening for foreign films could be seen as a continuation of cultural-minded censorship.  . 

===Religious===. 
A number of religious texts, publications, and materials are banned or have their distributions artificially limited in the PRC. Foreign citizens are also prohibited from [[Proselytism|proselytizing]] in China,<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.abriggs.com/visas/c/china_history.php|title= Information on China |accessdate= 23 April 2007|publisher=A Briggs|quote= Individuals believed to be engaged in religious proselytism or in conduct Chinese officials consider immoral or inappropriate have been detained and expelled |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928003014/http://www.abriggs.com/visas/c/china_history.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 28 September 2007}}</ref> and information concerning the treatment of some religious groups is also tightly controlled.  . 

The [[Falun Gong]] spiritual movement is subject to suppression in China, and virtually all religious texts, publications, and websites relating to the group have been banned, along with information on the imprisonment or torture of followers. <ref>Congressional Executive Commission on China, 2010 Annual Report, http://www.cecc.gov/pages/annualRpt/annualRpt09/CECCannRpt2009.pdf</ref>  . 

Christian Bibles are allowed to be printed in China but only in limited numbers and through a single press. <ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/119656.aspx |title= China Puts Bibles in Hotel Rooms for the Olympics|author=Robertson, Laura|date= 4 April 2007|publisher=CBN News}}</ref> . 

In 2007, anticipating the coming "Year of the Pig" in the [[Chinese calendar]], depictions of pigs were banned from [[China Central Television|CCTV]] "to avoid conflicts with ethnic minorities". <ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7213210|title= Ban Thwarts 'Year of the Pig' Ads in China|last= Lim|first= Louisa|date= 6 February 2007|publisher=National Public Radio}}</ref> This is believed to refer to China's population of 20 million [[Muslim]]s (to whom pigs are considered "[[Unclean animals|unclean]]").  . 

===Economic===. 
In recent years, censorship in China has been accused of being used not only for political protectionism but also for [[Protectionism|economic protectionism]]. <ref name="french">{{Cite web|url= http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=21492|title= French website blocked for warning of risks of investing in China|date= 30 March 2007 |publisher=Reporters Without Borders}}</ref><ref name="pat">{{Cite web|url= http://chovanec.wordpress.com/2010/01/02/al-jazeera-internet-censorship-in-china/|title= Al Jazeera: Internet Censorship in China|author=Chovanec, Patrick|date= 2 January 2010|work=|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2010}}</ref><ref name="obscene">{{Cite web|url= http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2009/06/regulators-target-google-for-pornographic-content-cctv-airs-fake-interview-netizens-react/|title= Regulators Target Google for Pornographic Content, CCTV Airs Fake Interview, Netizens React|author=|date= |work=|publisher=China Digital Times|accessdate=7 January 2010|quote= "Similarly, other search engines such as Baidu and Bing contain the same kinds of pornographic information, but CCTV completely ignores them. Netizens made screen captures to show that Baidu is no less vulgar than Google.cn"}}</ref> . 

In February 2007, the website of the French organization Observatoire International des Crises was banned in the PRC after it posted an article on the risks of trading with China. <ref name="french"/> . 

"How do you assess an investment opportunity if no reliable information about social tension, corruption or local trade unions is available? This case of censorship, affecting a very specialised site with solely French-language content, shows the [Chinese] government attaches as much importance to the censorship of economic data as political content," the organization was quoted as saying. <ref name="french"/> .

[[Tsinghua University]] professor Patrick Chovanec has speculated that the Chinese ban on [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[YouTube]] may have been done in part to grant a business advantage to the websites' Chinese competitors. <ref name="pat"/> Similarly, China has been accused of using a double standard in attacking Google for "obscene" content that is also present on Chinese competitor [[Baidu]]. <ref name="obscene"/><ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/0301/outfront-technology-internet-google-china-porn-trick_2.html|title= China's Porn Trick|author= |date= 11 February 2010|work= Forbes|publisher= |accessdate=9 February 2010|quote= Officials had better luck last year beating up on an easier target, the foreign interloper Google, accusing the search engine of allowing too much porn to show up in results.

The 2D version of the blockbuster film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' was also pulled from screens in the country; reportedly for taking in too much money and seizing market share from domestic films. <ref>{{Cite news|url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article6992685.ece|title= Confucius says no to ‘subversive’ blockbuster Avatar|author=|date= 19 January 2010|work=The Times |accessdate=19 January 2010|quote= Reportedly, the authorities have two reasons for this check on Avatar: first, it has taken in too much money and has seized market share from domestic films, and second, it may lead audiences to think about forced removal, and may possibly incite violence. | location=London | first=Jane | last=MacArtney}}</ref> . 

==Media, communication and education controls==. 
=== Newspapers ===. 
On the twentieth anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square]], the mainland media came under tremendous pressure from authorities. ''[[Ming Pao]]'' reported on the [[Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|Publicity Department's]] "hitherto unimaginable extent" of pressure to screen out any related content. The journal reported two incidents in 2008 which caused official concern, but which could not be proven to be deliberate challenges: ''[[Beijing News]]'' published an image of an injured persons being taken to the hospital on 4 June; ''[[Southern Metropolis Daily]]'' reported on unusual weather in Guangdong province with the headline of "4 storms in June," which both journals insisted were due to carelessness. Some newspapers have therefore instructed their editors to refrain from using the numbers '6' and '4' in their reports during this sensitive period. Furthermore, the numbers cannot be used in the headlines lest the Publicity Department disapproved.

Foreign and Hong Kong news broadcasts in mainland China from [[TVB]], [[CNN International]], [[BBC World Service]], and [[Bloomberg Television]] are occasionally censored by being "blacked out" during controversial segments. It is reported that CNN has made an arrangement that allowed their signal to pass through a Chinese-controlled satellite. Chinese authorities have been able to censor CNN segments at any time in this way. <ref name="CNN blackout">{{Cite web|url= http://news.yahoo.com/i/2444|title= China's media crackdown|accessdate=16 March 2008 |date= 14 March 2008|author=Vassileva, Ralitsa|publisher=CNN|format= video}}</ref> CNN's broadcasts are not widely available throughout China, but rather only in certain diplomatic compounds, hotels, and apartment blocks. <ref>{{Cite news| last = Vause| first = John| title =  San Francisco Torch Relay Broadcast| work=| pages =  | publisher=CNN| date =  9 April 2008}}</ref> .

{{See also|List of banned films#People's Republic of China|l1=Banned films, China}}
China has a large diversity of different foreign films broadcasted through the media and sold in markets. 
China has no [[motion picture rating system]], and films must therefore be deemed suitable for all audiences to be allowed to screen. <ref name="pirates"/><ref>{{Cite web|url= http://wwwj.comcast.net/movies/news/index.jsp?cat=MOVIES&fn=/2007/01/18/565295.html&cvqh=fight_departed|title= `Departed' Banned From China Theaters|last= Lee|first= Min|date= 18 January 2007|publisher=The Associated Press}}</ref> . 

For foreign-made films, this sometimes means controversial footage must be cut before such films can play in Chinese cinemas.

The GAPP has the legal authority to screen, censor, and ban any print, electronic, or Internet publication in China.

China's Internet censorship is regarded by many as the most pervasive and sophisticated in the world. According to a Harvard study conducted in 2002,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/filtering/china/|title= Empirical Analysis of Internet Filtering in China}}</ref> at least 18,000 [[List of websites blocked in the People's Republic of China|websites are blocked]] from within the country, and the number is believed to have been growing constantly. <ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15615952|title= Chinese firms to increase censorship of online content|publisher= BBC}}</ref> Banned sites have included [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]] (from July 2009) and [[Flickr]].

More recently, through individual negotiations with the Chinese government, Wikipedia, Google and YouTube have been opened up for public viewing with certain restrictions for those who access these sites from within mainland China. <ref>[http://www.gadgetell.com/tech/comment/china-lifts-restriction-to-english-wikipedia/]</ref> Although China has opened up Google for public viewing, it is google.cn as opposed to google.com.

Reporters in the western media have also suggested that China's internet censorship of foreign websites may also be a means of forcing mainland Chinese users to rely on China's own e-commerce industry, thus self-insulating their economy (for example censorship of large game sites such as newgrounds.com which have no political agenda). <ref name="Newsvine">{{Cite web| url = http://tomcarter.newsvine.com/_news/2007/02/15/569719-the-chinese-internet-crash-of-2007-calamity-or-capitalism | title = The Chinese Internet Crash of 2007 - Calamity or Capitalism? | accessdate = 5 September 2008 | author=Carter, Tom | last = | first = }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  In 2011 although China-based users of many Google services such as [[Google+]] did not always find the services entirely blocked, they were nonetheless throttled such that users could be expected to become frustrated with the frequent timeouts and switch to the faster, more reliable services of Chinese competitors. <ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/jun/30/google-plus-blocked-china Google+ 'blocked in China'] ''[[The Guardian]]''  30 June 2011</ref> . 

===Short Message Service===. 
{{Expand section|date=March 2008}}
According to Reporters without Borders, China has over 2,800 [[Short message service|Short Message Service]] (text messaging) surveillance centers. As of early 2010, cell phone users in Shanghai and Beijing risk having their text messaging service cut off if they are found to have sent "illegal or unhealthy" content. <ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-01/19/content_9340208.htm|title= Text message service cut off for 'bad' words|author=|date= 19 January 2010|work=China Daily |accessdate=19 January 2010}}</ref> .

===Video games===. 
{{see also|Video gaming in the People's Republic of China}}
In 2004, the Ministry of Culture set up a committee to screen imported online video games before they entered the Chinese market. It was stated that games with any of the following violations would be banned from importation:<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://english.people.com.cn/200405/31/eng20040531_144921.html|title= Censorship on imported online games strengthened|date= 31 May 2004|publisher=Xinhua}}</ref> . 

*Violating basic principles of [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|the Constitution]]
*Threatening national unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity
*Divulging state secrets
*Threatening state security
*Damaging the nation's glory
*Disturbing social order
*Infringing on others' legitimate rights . 

The State General Administration of Press and Publication and anti-porn and illegal publication offices have also played a role in screening games. <ref>{{Cite web|url= http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-01/26/content_2511068.htm|title= 50 illegal electronic games banned|date= 26 January 2006|publisher=Xinhua}}</ref> . 

Examples of banned games have included: . 

*''[[Hearts of Iron]]'' (for "distorting history and damaging China's sovereignty and territorial integrity")<ref name="swede game">{{Cite web|url= http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-05/29/content_334845.htm|title= Swedish video game banned for harming China's sovereignty|date= 29 May 2004|publisher=Xinhua}}</ref>

*''[[Command & Conquer: Generals – Zero Hour]]'' (for "smearing the image of China and the Chinese army")<ref name="swede game"/> . 

As with films, piracy makes acquiring banned video games in China very easy.  . 

===Education===. 
Educational institutions within China have been accused of [[Whitewash (censorship)|whitewashing]] PRC history by downplaying or avoiding mention of controversial historical events such as the [[Great Leap Forward]], [[Cultural Revolution]], and the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. <ref name="textbooks">{{Cite news|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/01/world/asia/01china.html?ex=1314763200&en=abf86c087b22be74&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss|title=  Where’s Mao?

In a January 2006 issue of ''Freezing Point'', a weekly supplement to the ''[[China Youth Daily]]'', [[Sun Yat-sen University|Zhongshan University]] professor [[Yuan Weishi]] published an article entitled "Modernization and History Textbooks" in which he criticized several [[middle school]] textbooks used in mainland China. <ref>{{Cite web|url= http://edu.people.com.cn/GB/1055/4016350.html|title= 现代化与历史教科书|author=袁伟时|date= 11 January 2006|language= Chinese}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.zonaeuropa.com/20060126_2.htm|title= History Textbooks in China|accessdate= |author=|authorlink= |date= |work=|publisher=EastSouthWestNorth|pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> In particular, he felt that depictions in the books of the [[Second Opium War]] avoided mention of Chinese diplomatic failures leading up to the war and that depictions of the [[Boxer Rebellion]] glossed over atrocities committed by the Boxer rebels.

In the ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|FRONTLINE]]'', four students from [[Peking University]] are seemingly unable to identify the context of the infamous [[Tank Man]] photo from the 1989 unrest sparked by [[Peking University]] students, though possibly, the students were feigning ignorance so as not to upset the party official who was monitoring the interview with clipboard in hand. <ref name="struggle">{{Cite web|url= http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tankman/view/|title= The Tank Man |accessdate= 21 February 2007|format= video|work=The Struggle to Control Information|publisher=PBS}}</ref> The segment implied that the subject is not addressed in Chinese schools.  . 

Indeed, on 4 June 2007, a person was able to place a small ad in a newspaper in southwest China to commemorate the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests reading "Paying tribute to the strong(-willed) mothers of 4 June victims". The accepting clerk claimed that he was ignorant of the event and believed that 4 June was the date of a mining disaster. <ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSHKG14616220070606|title= Young clerk let Tiananmen ad slip past censors: paper|accessdate= 7 June 2007|date= 6 June 2007|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}</ref> . 

==Self-censorship==. 
Although being independent from the mainland's legal system and hence censorship laws, some [[media of Hong Kong|Hong Kong media]] have been accused of practicing [[self-censorship]] in order to exchange for permission to expand their media business into the mainland market and for greater journalistic access in the mainland too. <ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.zonaeuropa.com/20061125_1.htm|title= Media Control and Self-Censorship in Hong Kong|author=|last= Zhang|first= Tao|year= 2006|month= November|publisher=Trend Magazine|language= English translation}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/rapport_en-3.pdf|title= CHINA: IS PLURALISM UNDER THREAT IN HONG KONG?|accessdate=17 March 2008 |format= |work=Reporters without Borders 2008 Annual Report}}</ref> . 

At the launch of a joint report published by the [[Hong Kong Journalists Association]] (HKJA) and "[[ARTICLE 19]]" in July 2001, the Chairman of the HKJA said: "More and more newspapers self-censor themselves because they are controlled by either a businessman with close ties to Beijing, or part of a large enterprise, which has financial interests over the border."<ref name=eroded>[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=11891&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20010702&sear_year=2001 Freedoms eroded to please Beijing: report], [[The Standard]], 2 July 2001</ref> For example, [[Robert Kuok]], who has business interests all over Asia, has been criticized over the departures of several China desk staff in rapid succession since he acquired the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', namely the editorial pages editor Danny Gittings, Beijing correspondent Jasper Becker, and China pages editor Willy Lam.

International corporations such as [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], MySpace, and [[Yahoo!]] voluntarily censor their content for Chinese markets in order to be allowed to do business in the country. <ref name="struggle"/> In October 2008, Canadian research group [[Citizen Lab]] released a new report saying [[TOM Online|TOM]]'s Chinese-language [[Skype]] software filtered sensitive words and then logged these, with users' information to a file on computer servers which were insecure. <ref name=spying>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7649761.stm China 'spying on Skype messages'], [[BBC News]] (3 October 2008)</ref> In September 2007, activists in China had already warned about the possibility that TOM's versions have or will have more [[trojan horse (computing)|trojan]] capability. <ref>[http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2007/09/24/2962449.htm Dynamic Internet Technology Inc.
