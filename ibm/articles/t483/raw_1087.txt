'''''Masses Publishing Co. v. Patten''''', [[Case citation|244 F. 535]] ([[S.D.N.Y.]] 1917), was a decision by the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]], that addressed advocacy of illegal activity under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].  . 

==Background==. 
In cases such as ''[[Abrams v. United States]]'', 250 U.S. 616 (1919) and ''[[Gitlow v. New York]]'', 268 U.S. 652 (1925) and others, the [[United States Supreme Court]] struggled to draw the line between politically unpopular speech and actual threats to national security.  ''Masses Publishing Co. v. Patten'' greatly influenced the Supreme Court’s eventual adoption in ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'' of the "incitement test" for advocacy of illegal activity.  . 

At issue in ''Masses Publishing Co. v. Patten'' was the federal [[Espionage Act of 1917]], which prohibited citizens from counseling or advising violation of the law.  The Court found that the New York postmaster's refusal to allow circulation of an antiwar journal under the statute violated the First Amendment.  . 

===Opinion===. 
[[Learned Hand]] wrote the opinion:
:“To assimilate agitation, legitimate as such, with direct incitement to violent resistance, is to disregard the tolerance of all methods of political agitation which in normal times is a safeguard of free government.” . 

Judge Hand affirmed that if a citizen “stops short of urging upon others that it is their duty or their interest to resist the law,” then he or she is protected by the First Amendment. One may, for example, “admire” resistors of the draft, but may not, under the “incitement” test, “counsel or advise” someone to violate the law at a specific time and place.  .
