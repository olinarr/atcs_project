The '''Universal Declaration of Human Rights''' ('''UDHR''') is a declaration adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] (10 December 1948 at [[Trocadéro|Palais de Chaillot]], Paris). The Declaration arose directly from the experience of the [[World War II|Second World War]] and represents the first global expression of rights to which all human beings are inherently entitled. It consists of 30 articles which have been elaborated in subsequent international treaties, regional human rights instruments, national constitutions and laws. The [[International Bill of Human Rights]] consists of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and its two Optional Protocols. In 1966 the General Assembly adopted the two detailed Covenants, which complete the International Bill of Human Rights; and in 1976, after the Covenants had been ratified by a sufficient number of individual nations, the Bill took on the force of [[international law]]. <ref>{{harvnb|Williams|1981}}; This is the first book edition of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, with a foreword by [[Jimmy Carter]]. </ref> .

During [[World War II|the Second World War]] the allies adopted the [[Four Freedoms]]: freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom from fear and freedom from want, as their basic war aims. The [[United Nations Charter]] "reaffirmed faith in fundamental human rights, and dignity and worth of the human person" and committed all member states to promote "universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion". <ref>United Nations Charter, preamble and article 56</ref> . 

When the atrocities committed by [[Nazi Germany]] became apparent after the Second World War, the consensus within the world community was that the [[United Nations Charter]] did not sufficiently define the rights it referenced. <ref>[http://www.udhr.org/history/overview.htm#Cataclysm%20and%20World%20Response Cataclysm and World Response] in  [http://www.udhr.org/history/overview.htm Drafting and Adoption : The Universal Declaration of Human Rights], [http://www.udhr.org udhr.org]. </ref><ref>[http://www.udhr.org/Introduction/question4.htm UDHR50: Didn't Nazi tyranny end all hope for protecting human rights in the modern world?]</ref> A universal declaration that specified the rights of individuals was necessary to give effect to the Charter's provisions on human rights. <ref>[http://www.universalrights.net/main/creation.htm UDHR – History of human rights]</ref> . 

===Drafting===. 
{{main|Drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights}} . 

Canadian [[John Peters Humphrey]] was called upon by the [[United Nations Secretary-General]] to work on the project and became the Declaration's principal drafter. <ref>{{harvnb|Morsink|1999|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=w8OapwltI3YC&pg=PA5 5]}}. </ref> At the time Humphrey was newly appointed as Director of the Division of Human Rights within the United Nations Secretariat. <ref>{{harvnb|Morsink|1999|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=w8OapwltI3YC&pg=PA133 133]}}. </ref> The Commission on Human Rights, a standing body of the United Nations, was constituted to undertake the work of preparing what was initially conceived as an International Bill of Rights. <ref name=morsink1999p4>{{harvnb|Morsink|1999|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=w8OapwltI3YC&pg=PA4 4]}}. </ref> The membership of the Commission was designed to be broadly representative of the global community with representatives of the following countries serving: Australia, Belgium, [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]], [[Chile]], China, [[Egypt]], France, India, [[Iran]], [[Lebanon]], [[Panama]], [[Philippines]], United Kingdom, United States, [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Yugoslavia]]. <ref name=morsink1999p4 /> Well known members of the Commission included [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] of the United States, who was the Chairperson, [[Jacques Maritain]], [[René Cassin]] and [[Stéphane Hessel]] of France, [[Charles Malik]] of [[Lebanon]], and [[P. C. Chang]] of the [[Republic of China]], among others. Humphrey provided the initial draft which became the working text of the Commission.  . 

According to ''Globalizing Family Values'', the Declaration's pro-family phrases were the result of the [[Christian Democratic]] movement's influence on Cassin and Malik. <ref>Carlson, Allan (12 January 2004.

===Adoption===. 
The Universal Declaration was adopted by the General Assembly on 10 December 1948 by a vote of 48 in favour, 0 against, with eight [[abstentions]]: the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|USSR]], [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]], [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]], [[South Africa]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Saudi Arabia]]. <ref>[http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/mmt/udhr/udhr_general/drafting_history_10.html UDHR Drafting History], [http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/about/ Center for New Media Teaching and Learning], [[Columbia University]]</ref><ref>See "Who are the signatories of the Declaration?" in [http://www.unac.org/rights/question.html Questions and answers about the Universal Declaration of Human Rights], [http://www.unac.org United Nations Association in Canada]. </ref> .

Despite the central role played by Canadian John Humphrey, the Canadian Government at first abstained from voting on the Declaration's draft, but later voted in favour of the final draft in the General Assembly. <ref>{{cite journal|title=Canada and the Adoption of Universal Declaration of Human Rights|last=Schabas|first=William|journal=McGill Law Journal|pages=403|volume=43|year=1998|url=http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=info:bhD3YIk9aKUJ:scholar.google.com/&output=viewport|format=fee required}}</ref> . 

==Structure==. 
The underlying structure of the Universal Declaration was introduced in its second draft which was prepared by [[René Cassin]]. Cassin worked from a first draft prepared by [[John Peters Humphrey]]. The structure was influenced by the Code Napoleon, including a preamble and introductory general principles. <ref>{{harvnb|Glendon|2002|pp=62–64}}. </ref> Cassin compared the Declaration to the [[portico]] of a Greek temple, with a foundation, steps, four columns and a [[pediment]]. Articles 1 and 2 are the foundation blocks, with their principles of dignity, liberty, equality and brotherhood. The seven paragraphs of the preamble, setting out the reasons for the Declaration, are represented by the steps. The main body of the Declaration forms the four columns. The first column (articles 3–11) constitutes rights of the individual, such as the right to life and the prohibition of slavery. The second column (articles 12–17) constitutes the rights of the individual in civil and political society. The third column (articles 18–21) is concerned with spiritual, public and political freedoms such as freedom of religion and freedom of association. The fourth column (articles 22–27) sets out social, economic and cultural rights. In Cassin's model, the last three articles of the Declaration provide the pediment which binds the structure together. These articles are concerned with the duty of the individual to society and the prohibition of use of rights in contravention of the purposes of the United Nations. <ref>{{harvnb|Glendon|2002}}, Chapter 10. </ref> . 

==Text of the Declaration==. 
===Preamble=== . 

Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world, .

==Commemoration: International Human Rights Day==. 
{{main|Human Rights Day}} . 

The adoption of the Universal Declaration is a significant international commemoration marked each year on 10 December and is known as [[Human Rights Day]] or International Human Rights Day.  The commemoration is observed by individuals, community and religious groups, human rights organisations, parliaments, governments and the United Nations.  Decadal commemorations are often accompanied by campaigns to promote awareness of the Declaration and human rights.  2008 marked the 60th anniversary of the Declaration and was accompanied by year-long activities around the theme "Dignity and justice for all of us". <ref name="udhr60">{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/events/humanrights/udhr60/ |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: 1948–2008 |publisher=[[United Nations]] |accessdate=15 February 2011}}</ref> . 

==Significance and legal effect==. 
===Significance===. 
The ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' describes the UDHR as the "Most Translated Document"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/pages/WorldRecord.aspx |title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights |publisher=United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human rights}}</ref> in the world. In the preamble, governments commit themselves and their people to progressive measures which secure the universal and effective recognition and observance of the [[human rights]] set out in the Declaration.  Eleanor Roosevelt supported the adoption of the UDHR as a declaration rather than as a treaty, because she believed that it would have the same kind of influence on global society as the United States Declaration of Independence had within the United States.  In this, she proved to be correct.  Even though it is not  legally binding, the Declaration has been adopted in or has influenced most national constitutions since 1948.  It has also served as the foundation for a growing number of national laws, international laws, and treaties, as well as regional, national, and sub-national institutions protecting and promoting human rights.  . 

===Legal effect===. 
While not a treaty itself, the Declaration was explicitly adopted for the purpose of defining the meaning of the words "fundamental freedoms" and "human rights" appearing in the United Nations Charter, which is binding on all member states.  For this reason the Universal Declaration is a fundamental constitutive document of the United Nations.  Many international lawyers, in addition, believe that the Declaration forms part of [[customary international law]] and is a powerful tool in applying diplomatic and moral pressure to governments that violate any of its articles. The 1968 United Nations International Conference on Human Rights advised that it "constitutes an obligation for the members of the international community" to all persons. The declaration has served as the foundation for two binding UN human rights covenants, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] and the principles of the Declaration are elaborated in international treaties such as the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the International Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the United Nations Convention Against Torture and many more. The Declaration continues to be widely cited by governments, academics, advocates and constitutional courts and individual human beings who appeal to its principles for the protection of their recognised human rights.  . 

==Reaction==. 
===Praise===. 
The Universal Declaration has received praise from a number of notable people. [[Charles Malik]], [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] philosopher and diplomat, called it "an international document of the first order of importance,"<ref>[http://www.un.org/law/AVLpilotproject/udhr_audio.html Statement by Charles Malik as Representative of Lebanon to the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly on the Universal Declaration, 6 November 1948]{{dead link|date=February 2011|url=http://www.un.org/law/AVLpilotproject/udhr_audio.html}}</ref> while [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], first chairwoman of the [[Commission on Human Rights]] (CHR) that drafted the Declaration, stated that it "may well become the international [[Magna Carta]] of all men everywhere."<ref>[http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/eleanorrooseveltdeclarationhumanrights.htm Eleanor Roosevelt: Address to the United Nations General Assembly]</ref> 10 December 1948. In a speech on 5 October 1995, Pope [[John Paul II]] called the UDHR "one of the highest expressions of the human [[conscience]] of our time". <ref>[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/2003/documents/rc_seg-st_20031210_human-rights_en.html John Paul II, Address to the U.N., October 2, 1979 and October 5, 1995]</ref> And in a statement on 10 December 2003 on behalf of the [[European Union]], [[Marcello Spatafora]] said that "it placed human rights at the centre of the framework of principles and obligations shaping relations within the [[international community]]."{{citation needed|date=December 2008}} . 

===Criticism===. 
====Muslim countries====. 
Most Muslim countries have signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other human rights agreements. In 1948, [[Saudi Arabia]] didn't sign the declaration, arguing it violated [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. <ref>{{cite book|author=Nisrine Abiad|title=Sharia, Muslim states and international human rights treaty obligations: a comparative study|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dex7TKuoUhgC|year=2008|publisher=BIICL|isbn=978-1-905221-41-7|pages=[http://books.google.ca/books?id=dex7TKuoUhgC&pg=PA60 60–65]}}</ref> However, [[Pakistan]] (which had signed the declaration) criticized the Saudi position. <ref>{{harvnb|Price|1999|p=[http://books.google.ca/books?id=YgF58rl4tCkC&pg=PA163 163]}}. </ref> In 1982, the Iranian representative to the [[United Nations]], [[Said Rajaie-Khorassani]], said that the UDHR was "a [[Secularism|secular]] understanding of the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition", which could not be implemented by Muslims without trespassing the [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. <ref name="Littman1999">{{cite news | last = Littman | first = D | title = Universal Human Rights and Human Rights in Islam | work = Midstream | date = February/March 1999 | url =http://mypage.bluewin.ch/ameland/Islam.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060501234759/http://mypage.bluewin.ch/ameland/Islam.html | archivedate = 2006-05-12 }}</ref> On 30 June 2000, Muslim nations that are members of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (now the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]]) officially resolved to support the [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]],<ref name="OIC Resolution on CDHRI">{{cite web | url = http://www.oic-oci.org/english/conf/fm/27/27th-fm-political(3).htm#60 | title = Resolution No 60/27-P | date = 2000-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-02 | publisher = Organisation of the Islamic Conference}}</ref> an alternative document that says people have "freedom and right to a dignified life in accordance with the Islamic Shari’ah", without any discrimination on  grounds of "race, colour, language, sex, religious belief, political affiliation, social status or other considerations." As a secular state, Turkey has signed the declaration of Human Rights in 1948 and other European Human Rights agreements.  . 

The '''Universal Islamic Declaration of Human Rights''' is a document created by Islamic Councils in Paris<ref>Salem Azzam. "[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a783169489 Universal Islamic declaration of human rights]". ''The International Journal of Human Rights'', Volume 2, Issue 3 Autumn 1998 , pages 102 - 112</ref> and London. <ref>Fred Halliday.

''Islam and Human Rights: Tradition and Politics'' 3rd Edition. Westview Press, 2006, p. 76. </ref> Among other problems, Mayer notes that throughout the document, references specifically to ''shari'a'' law are mentioned only as "the Law," which could mislead readers of only the English version.  . 

====Education====. 
Many proponents of [[alternative education]], particularly [[unschooling]], take issue with Article 26 where it stipulates that "Elementary education shall be compulsory." In the philosophies of [[John Holt (educator)|John Holt]] and others, compulsory education itself violates the right of a person to peacefully follow his or her own interests: . 

{{Quotation|No human right, except the right to life itself, is more fundamental than this. A person’s freedom of learning is part of his freedom of thought, even more basic than his freedom of speech. If we take from someone his right to decide what he will be curious about, we destroy his freedom of thought. We say, in effect, you must think not about what interests you and concerns you, but about what interests and concerns us.|[[John Holt (educator)|John Holt]]|Escape from Childhood}} . 

This instance of the word "compulsory" is the only one in the entire document. The word "compel" is used twice, however, both times with negative connotations.  . 

====The Right to Refuse to Kill====. 
Groups such as [[Amnesty International]]<ref name="autogenerated1997">[http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/EUR01/004/1997/en Out of the margins: the right to conscientious objection to military service in Europe: An announcement of Amnesty International's forthcoming campaign and briefing for the UN Commission on Human Rights], 31 March 1997. Amnesty International. </ref> and [[War Resisters International]]<ref name="War Resisters International">[http://www.wri-irg.org/books/co-guide-un.htm A Conscientious Objector's Guide to the UN Human Rights System], Parts 1, 2 & 3, Background Information on International Law for COs, Standards which recognise the right to conscientious objection, War Resisters' International. </ref> have advocated for "The Right to Refuse to Kill" to be added to the UDHR. War Resisters International has stated that the right to [[Conscientious objector|conscientious objection]] to military service is primarily derived from, but not yet explicit in, Article 18 of the UDHR: the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. <ref name="War Resisters International" /> . 

[[Conscientious Objector#United Nations|Steps have been taken within the United Nations to make this right more explicit]]; but those steps have been limited to secondary, more "marginal" United Nations documents.  That is why Amnesty International would like to have this right brought "out of the margins" and explicitly into the primary document, namely the UDHR itself. <ref name="autogenerated1997"/> .

===Bangkok Declaration===. 
In the Bangkok Declaration adopted by Ministers of Asian states meeting in 1993 in the lead up to the [[World Conference on Human Rights]] held in the same year, Asian governments reaffirmed their commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  They stated their view of the interdependence and indivisibility of human rights and stressed the need for universality, objectivity and non-selectivity of human rights. At the same time, however, they emphasized the principles of sovereignty and noninterference, calling for greater emphasis on economic, social, and cultural rights, particularly the right to economic development, over civil and political rights. The Bangkok Declaration is considered to be a landmark expression of the [[Asian Values]] perspective, which offers an extended critique of human rights [[Moral universalism|universalism]]. <ref>[http://law.hku.hk/lawgovtsociety/Bangkok%20Declaration.htm Final Declaration Of The Regional Meeting For Asia Of The World Conference On Human Rights]</ref> .
