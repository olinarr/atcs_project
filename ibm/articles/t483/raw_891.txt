The '''Bill of Rights''' is the collective name for the first ten [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|amendments]] to the [[United States Constitution]]. These limitations serve to protect the [[natural rights]] of [[liberty]] and [[property]]. They guarantee a number of personal freedoms, limit the government's power in judicial and other proceedings, and reserve some powers to the states and the public. While originally the amendments applied only to the federal government, most of their provisions have since been [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|held]] to apply to the states by way of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].  . 

The amendments were introduced by [[James Madison]] to the [[1st United States Congress]] as a series of [[legislation|legislative]] articles. They were adopted by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on August 21, 1789,<ref name="adamson2008p93">{{cite book|title=Freedom of Religion, the First Amendment, and the Supreme Court: How the Court Flunked History|last=Adamson|first=Barry|year=2008|page=93|publisher=Pelican Publishing|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Tgw-rCrNYacC&pg=PA93}}</ref><ref name="house1789p85">{{citation|title=Journal of the House of Representatives of the United States, 1789-1793|page=85|date=Friday, August 21, 1789|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(hj001139)):}}</ref> formally proposed by [[joint resolution]] of Congress on September 25, 1789, and came into effect as Constitutional Amendments on December 15, 1791, through the process of [[United States Constitution#Amendments|ratification]] by three-fourths of the States. While twelve amendments were passed by Congress, only ten were originally passed by the states. Of the remaining two, one was adopted as the [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-seventh Amendment]] and the other technically remains pending before the states.  . 

Originally, the Bill of Rights legally protected only land-owning white men,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aclu.org/racial-justice_prisoners-rights_drug-law-reform_immigrants-rights/bill-rights-brief-history |title=The Bill of Rights: A Brief History |publisher=Aclu.org |date=2002-03-04 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref> excluding African Americans<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Civil+Rights |title=Legal definition of Civil Rights |publisher=Legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref> and women. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/eagle/congress/ketcham.html |title=Are Women Citizens and People? |publisher=Digital.library.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&crawlid=1&doctype=cite&docid=59+U.+Chi.+L.+Rev.+453&srctype=smi&srcid=3B15&key=0fa2e584d317d82d303d07fcf6bda46f |title=University of Chicago Law Review |publisher=Litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref>.  However, these limitations were not explicit in the Bill of Right's text.  It took additional [[US Constitutional Amendments|Constitutional Amendments]] and numerous [[US Supreme Court cases|Supreme Court cases]] to extend the same rights to all U.S. citizens.  . 

The Bill of Rights plays a key role in [[Law of the United States|American law]] and government, and remains a vital symbol of the freedoms and [[Culture of the United States|culture]] of the nation. One of the first fourteen copies of the Bill of Rights is on public display at the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].  . 

==Background and historical context==. 
===English Bill of Rights===. 
One of the earliest documents used in drafting the American Bill of Rights was the [[Bill of Rights 1689|English Bill of Rights]] of 1689, one of the fundamental documents of English constitutional law. The English Bill of Rights differed substantially in form and intent from the American Bill of Rights, because it was intended to address the rights of citizens as represented by [[British Parliament|Parliament]] against [[the Crown]]. However, some of its basic tenets were adopted and extended by the U.S. Bill of Rights, including: . 

*the right of petition,
*an independent judiciary (the Sovereign was forbidden to establish his own courts or to act as a judge himself),
*freedom from [[tax]]ation by royal (executive) prerogative, without agreement by Parliament (legislators),
*freedom from a peace-time standing army,
*freedom [for [[Protestantism|Protestants]]] to bear arms for their defence, as allowed by law,
*freedom to elect members of Parliament without interference from the Sovereign,
*freedom of speech in Parliament,
*freedom from cruel and unusual punishments and excessive [[bail]], and
*freedom from fines and [[Asset forfeiture|forfeitures]] without trial.  . 

====Virginia Declaration of Rights====. 
{{Main|Virginia Declaration of Rights}}
The Virginia Declaration of Rights, well-known to Madison, had already been a strong influence on the American Revolution ("all power is vested in, and consequently derived from, the people ...";<ref>[[Virginia Declaration of Rights]], Article 2</ref> also "a majority of the community hath an indubitable, unalienable, and indefeasible right to reform, alter or abolish [the government]"). It had shaped the drafting of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] a decade before the drafting of the Constitution, proclaiming that "all men are by nature equally free and independent, and have certain inherent rights of which ... [they cannot divest;] namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety."<ref>Article 1, later paraphrased in the opening sentences of the United States Declaration of Independence. </ref> On a practical level, its recommendations of a government with a [[separation of powers]] (Articles 5–6) and "frequent, certain, and regular"<ref>Article 5</ref> [[Elections in the United States|elections]] of executives and legislators were incorporated into the United States Constitution&nbsp;— but the bulk of this work addresses the rights of the people and restrictions on the powers of government, and is recognizable in the modern Bill of Rights: . 

The government should not have the power of suspending or executing laws, "without consent of the representatives of the people,". <ref>Article 7</ref> A legal defendant has the right to be "confronted with the accusers and witnesses, to call for evidence in his favor, and to a speedy trial by an impartial jury of his vicinage," and may not be "compelled to give evidence against himself."<ref>Article 8</ref> Individuals should be protected against "[[cruel and unusual punishment]]s",<ref>Article 9</ref> baseless [[search and seizure]],<ref>Article 10</ref> and be guaranteed a [[jury trial|trial by jury]]. <ref>Article 11</ref> The government should not abridge [[freedom of the press]],<ref>Article 12</ref> or [[freedom of religion]] ("all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion"). <ref>Article 16</ref> The government should be enjoined against maintaining a [[standing army]] rather than a "well regulated [[militia]]". <ref>Article 13</ref> . 

===Articles of Confederation===. 
Prior to the acceptance and implementation of the [[United States Constitution]], the original 13 colonies followed the stipulations and agreements set forth in the [[Articles of Confederation]], created by the [[Second Continental Congress]] and ratified in 1781. The national government that operated under the Articles of Confederation was too weak however to adequately regulate the various conflicts that arose between the states. <ref name="TAH">{{cite web|url=http://www.teachingamericanhistory.org/convention/intro.html|author=Lloyd, Gordon|title=Introduction to the Constitutional Convention|accessdate=October 6, 2007}}</ref> The [[Philadelphia Convention]] set out to correct weaknesses inherent in the Articles of Confederation that had been apparent even before the [[American Revolutionary War]] had been successfully concluded. <ref name="TAH"/> The newly constituted Federal government included a strong [[executive branch]], a stronger [[legislative branch]] and an independent [[judiciary]].  . 

The Bill of Rights is a series of limitations on the power of the U.S. federal government, protecting the [[natural rights]] of [[liberty]] and [[property]] including freedom of religion, freedom of speech, a free press, free assembly, and free association, as well as the right to keep and bear arms.  In federal criminal cases, it requires [[indictment]] by a [[grand jury]] for any [[capital punishment|capital]] or "infamous crime", guarantees a speedy, public [[trial]] with an impartial [[jury trial|jury]] composed of members of the state or judicial district in which the crime occurred, and prohibits [[double jeopardy]]. In addition, the Bill of Rights reserves for the people any rights not specifically mentioned in the Constitution<ref>"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people," see: [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]</ref> and reserves all powers not specifically granted to the federal government to the people or the [[U.S. state|States]].  Most of these restrictions on the federal government were later [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|applied to the states]] by a series of legal decisions applying the due process clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which was ratified in 1868.  The Bill was influenced by [[George Mason]]'s 1776 [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]], the English [[Bill of Rights 1689]], works of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] pertaining to natural rights, and earlier [[Kingdom of England|English]] political documents such as [[Magna Carta]] (1215).  . 

===The Anti-Federalists===. 
{{See also|Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalist Papers}} . 

[[Image:Patrick henry.JPG|thumb|On June 5, 1788, [[Patrick Henry]] spoke before [[Virginia Ratifying Convention|Virginia's ratification convention]] in opposition to the Constitution.]]
Following the Philadelphia Convention, some famous [[American Revolution|revolutionary]] figures and statesmen, such as [[Patrick Henry]], publicly argued against the Constitution. <ref>Henry, Patrick. {{cite web|url=http://www.wfu.edu/~zulick/340/henry.html|title="Against the Federal Constitution."  June 5, 1788.|date=2006-03-10}}</ref> Many were concerned that the strong national government proposed by the Federalists was a threat to [[individual rights]] and that the [[President of the United States|President]] would become a king, and objected to the federal court system in the proposed Constitution.  . 

[[Thomas Jefferson]], at the time serving as Ambassador to [[Early Modern France|France]], wrote to Madison advocating a Bill of Rights: "Half a loaf is better than no bread. If we cannot secure all our rights, let us secure what we can."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/print_documents/v1ch14s49.html|title=Jefferson's letter to Madison, March 15, 1789.|date=2006-03-09}}</ref>  [[George Mason]] refused to sign the proposed Constitution, in part to protest its lack of a Bill of Rights. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://constitutioncenter.org/ncc_edu_Virginia.aspx |title=National Constitution Center: Virginia |publisher=Constitutioncenter.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-04}}</ref> . 

In a paper later collected into the ''Anti-Federalist Papers'', the [[pseudonym]]ous "[[Brutus]]" (probably [[Robert Yates (politician)|Robert Yates]]) wrote, . 

<blockquote>
We find they have, in the [[Denied powers|ninth section of the first article]] declared, that the writ of [[habeas corpus]] shall not be suspended, unless in cases of rebellion&nbsp;— that no [[bill of attainder]], or [[ex post facto law]], shall be passed&nbsp;— that no title of [[nobility]] shall be granted by the United States, etc. If every thing which is not given is reserved, what propriety is there in these exceptions? Does this Constitution any where grant the power of suspending the habeas corpus, to make ex post facto laws, pass bills of attainder, or grant titles of nobility? It certainly does not in express terms. The only answer that can be given is, that these are implied in the general powers granted. With equal truth it may be said, that all the powers which the bills of rights guard against the abuse of, are contained or implied in the general ones granted by this Constitution. <ref name="Brutus">{{cite web|title="On the lack of a Bill of Rights," also known as "Anti-Federalist #84"|url=http://www.wepin.com/articles/afp/afp84.html|accessdate=2006-02-28}}  Also see: "The Federalist with Letters of Brutus", edited by Terence Ball, Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought, pp. 447–453. Excerpt from the writings of "Brutus" probably in the New York Journal, November 1, 1787. </ref></blockquote> . 

Brutus continued with an implication directed against the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]]:
<blockquote>Ought not a government, vested with such extensive and indefinite authority, to have been restricted by a declaration of rights? It certainly ought. So clear a point is this, that I cannot help suspecting that persons who attempt to persuade people that such reservations were less necessary under this Constitution than under those of the States, are wilfully endeavoring to deceive, and to lead you into an absolute state of vassalage. <ref name="Brutus" /></blockquote> . 

==Philadelphia Convention==. 
The United States Constitutional Convention<ref name=Jillson2009>{{cite book|title=American Government: Political Development and Institutional Change|author=Calvin C. Jillson|edition=5th|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2009|isbn=9780203887028|page=31}}</ref> (also known as the [[Philadelphia Convention]],<ref name=Jillson2009/> and various other names) took place from May 14 to September 17, 1787, in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] and although the Convention was purportedly intended only to revise the Articles of Confederation, the intention from the outset of many of its proponents, chief among them [[James Madison]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]], was to create a new government rather than fix the existing one.  Due to the difficulty of travel in the late 18th century, very few of the selected delegates were present on the designated day of May 14, 1787, and it was not until May 25 that a quorum of seven states was secured. The convention convened in the [[Independence Hall (United States)|Pennsylvania State House]], and George Washington was unanimously elected as president of the convention<ref name="JMU">{{cite web|url=http://www.jmu.edu/madison/gpos225-madison2/adopt.htm}|author=Bent, Devin|title="Constitutional Convention Overview"|accessdate=October 6, 2007|language=English}}</ref> and [[William Jackson (secretary)|William Jackson]] was elected as secretary. Madison's ''[[Notes of Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787]]'' remain the most complete record of the convention. <ref name="TAH"/> . 

In late July 1787, the convention appointed a [[Committee of Detail]] to draft a document based on the agreements that had been reached. After another month of discussion and refinement, a second committee, the Committee of Style and Arrangement, headed by [[Gouverneur Morris]], and including Hamilton, William Samuel Johnson, Rufus King, and Madison, produced the final version, which was submitted for signing on September 17. Morris is credited, both now and then, as the chief draftsman of the final document, including the preamble.  . 

Not all delegates were pleased with the results and thirteen of them left before the ceremony, three of those remaining refused to sign: [[Edmund Randolph]] of [[Virginia]], [[George Mason]] of [[Virginia]], and [[Elbridge Gerry]] of [[Massachusetts]]. [[George Mason]] demanded a [[Bill of Rights]] if he was to support the Constitution. The Bill of Rights was not included in the Constitution submitted to the states for ratification, but many states ratified it anyway with the understanding that a bill of rights would soon follow. <ref name="bor">{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/bill_of_rights.html|author=National Archives|title=Bill of Rights|accessdate=November 21, 2007}}</ref> 39 of the 55 delegates ended up signing, but it is likely that none were completely satisfied. Their views were summed up by [[Benjamin Franklin]], who said, <blockquote>"There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them. ... I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain, may be able to make a better Constitution. ... It therefore astonishes me, Sir, to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does; and I think it will astonish our enemies..."</blockquote> . 

Delegates to the Philadelphia Convention on September 12, 1787, debated whether to include a [[Bill of Rights]] in the body of the U.S. Constitution, and an agreement to create the Bill of Rights helped to secure ratification of the Constitution itself. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_history.html|title=A More Perfect Union: The Creation of the U.S. Constitution|accessdate=2010-07-17|author=Bruns, Roger A.}}</ref>  Ideological conflict between [[Federalism in the United States|Federalists]] and [[anti-Federalism|anti-Federalists]] threatened the final ratification of the new national Constitution.  Thus, the Bill addressed the concerns of some of the Constitution's influential opponents, including prominent [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], who argued that the Constitution should not be ratified because it failed to protect the fundamental principles of human [[liberty]].  . 

The Constitution was then submitted to the states for ratification, pursuant to its own [[United States Constitution#Article Seven: Ratification|Article VII]]. Twelve articles were proposed to the States, but only ten, corresponding to the First through Tenth Amendments, were ratified in the 18th Century.  The [[Article the First|first Article]], dealing with the number and apportionment of [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representatives]], has never been ratified, and the second, limiting the power of Congress to increase the salaries of its members, was ratified in 1992 as the [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|27th Amendment]].  . 

===Delegates to the Constitutional convention===. 
The 55 [[delegate]]s who drafted the Constitution included many of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] of the new nation. [[Thomas Jefferson]], who was [[United States Ambassador to France|Minister to France]] during the convention, characterized the delegates as an assembly of "demi-gods."<ref name="TAH"/>  [[John Adams]] also did not attend, being abroad in Europe as [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|Minister to Great Britain]], but he wrote home to encourage the delegates.  [[Patrick Henry]] was also absent; he refused to go because he "smelt a rat in Philadelphia, tending toward the monarchy."  Also absent were [[John Hancock]] and [[Samuel Adams]].  Rhode Island refused to send delegates to the convention.

==The Bill of Rights==. 
===The Ideas of John Locke===. 
[[Image:Madison.notes.06081789.jpg|thumb|Madison's "Notes for speech on Constitutional amendments, June 8, 1789, in which he underlined the concept of "[[natural rights]] retained"]]
To some degree, the Bill of Rights (and the American Revolution) incorporated the ideas of [[John Locke]], who argued in his 1689 work ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' that [[civil society]] was created for the protection of property ([[Latin]] ''proprius'', or that which is one's own, meaning "life, liberty, and estate"). Locke also advanced the notion that each individual is free and equal in the [[state of nature]]. Locke expounded on the idea of natural rights that are inherent to all individuals, a concept Madison mentioned in his speech presenting the Bill of Rights to the 1st Congress. Locke's argument for protecting economic rights against government may have been most salient to the framers of the Amendments; quartering and cruel punishments were not the current abuses of 1791. <ref>see [[Jerome Huyler]], ''Locke in America : the moral philosophy of the founding era'', Lawrence : [[University Press of Kansas]], (1995), Chapter 8, pp.218–250; also pp. 275–9. For "many scholars"' discussion of economic rights and the Amendments, see p. 277. </ref> . 

===Madison's preemptive proposal===. 
On June 8, 1789, Madison submitted his proposal to Congress. In his speech to Congress on that day, Madison said: . 

<blockquote>For while we feel all these inducements to go into a revisal of the constitution, we must feel for the constitution itself, and make that revisal a moderate one. I should be unwilling to see a door opened for a re-consideration of the whole structure of the government, for a re-consideration of the principles and the substance of the powers given; because I doubt, if such a door was opened, if we should be very likely to stop at that point which would be safe to the government itself: But I do wish to see a door opened to consider, so far as to incorporate those provisions for the security of rights, against which I believe no serious objection has been made by any class of our constituents. <ref name=center>{{cite web|url=http://www.jmu.edu/madison/center/main_pages/madison_archives/constit_confed/rights/jmproposal/jmspeech.htm|title=Text of Madison's speech, at the James Madison Center|accessdate=2006-02-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050306125448/http://www.jmu.edu/madison/center/main_pages/madison_archives/constit_confed/rights/jmproposal/jmspeech.htm |archivedate = March 6, 2005}}</ref></blockquote> . 

Prior to listing his proposals for a number of constitutional amendments, Madison acknowledged a major reason for some of the discontent with the Constitution as written: . 

<blockquote>I believe that the great mass of the people who opposed [the Constitution], disliked it because it did not contain effectual provision against encroachments on particular rights, and those safeguards which they have been long accustomed to have interposed between them and the magistrate who exercised the sovereign power: nor ought we to consider them safe, while a great number of our fellow citizens think these securities necessary. <ref name=center/></blockquote> . 

Madison's proposed amendments were presented as Nine Articles comprisinng up to 20 Amendemnts.  . 

<blockquote>The amendments which have occurred to me, proper to be recommended by congress to the state legislatures are these: . 

<br />
First. That there be prefixed to the constitution a declaration That all power is originally vested in, and consequently derived from the people. 
<br /> . 

That government is instituted, and ought to be exercised for the benefit of the people; which consists in the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the right of acquiring and using property, and generally of pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.  . 

<br />
That the people have an indubitable, unalienable, and indefeasible right to reform or change their government, whenever it be found adverse or inadequate to the purposes of its institution.  . 

<br />
Secondly. That in article 2nd. section 2, clause 3, these words be struck out, to wit, "The number of representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand, but each state shall have at least one representative, and until such enumeration shall be made." And that in place thereof be inserted these words, to wit, "After the first actual enumeration, there shall be one representative for every thirty thousand, until the number amount to after which the proportion shall be so regulated by congress, that the number shall never be less than nor more than but each state shall after the first enumeration, have at least two representatives; and prior thereto." . 

<br />
Thirdly. That in article 2nd, section 6, clause 1, there be added to the end of the first sentence, these words, to wit, "But no law varying the compensation last ascertained shall operate before the next ensuing election of representatives." . 

<br />Fourthly. That in article 2nd, section 9, between clauses 3 and 4, be inserted these clauses, to wit,The civil rights of none shall be abridged on account of religious belief or worship, nor shall any national religion be established, nor shall the full and equal rights of conscience by in any manner, or on any pretext infringed . 

<br />The people shall not be deprived or abridged of their right to speak, to write, or to publish their sentiments; and the freedom of the press, as one of the great bulwarks of liberty, shall be inviolable.  . 

<br />The people shall not be restrained from peaceably assembling and consulting for their common good, nor from applying to the legislature by petitions, or remonstrances for redress of their grievances.  . 

<br />The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; a well armed, and well regulated militia being the best security of a free country: but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms, shall be compelled to render military service in person.  . 

<br />No soldier shall in time of peace be quartered in any house without the consent of the owner; nor at any time, but in a manner warranted by law.  . 

<br />No person shall be subject, except in cases of impeachment, to more than one punishment, or one trial for the same office; nor shall be compelled to be a witness against himself; nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; nor be obliged to relinquish his property, where it may be necessary for public use, without a just compensation.  . 

<br />Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.  . 

<br />The rights of the people to be secured in their persons, their houses, their papers, and their other property from all unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated by warrants issued without probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, or not particularly describing the places to be searched, or the persons or things to be seized.  . 

<br />In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, to be informed of the cause and nature of the accusation, to be confronted with his accusers, and the witnesses against him; to have a compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor; and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.  . 

<br />The exceptions here or elsewhere in the constitution, made in favor of particular rights, shall not be so construed as to diminish the just importance of other rights retained by the people; or as to enlarge the powers delegated by the constitution; but either as actual limitations of such powers, or as inserted merely for greater caution.  . 

<br />Fifthly. That in article 2nd, section 10, between clauses 1 and 2, be inserted this clause, to wit: No state shall violate the equal rights of conscience, or the freedom of the press, or the trial by jury in criminal cases.  . 

<br />Sixthly. That article 3rd, section 2, be annexed to the end of clause 2nd, these words to wit: but no appeal to such court shall be allowed where the value in controversy shall not amount to————dollars: nor shall any fact triable by jury, according to the course of common law, be otherwise re—examinable than may consist with the principles of common law.  . 

<br />Seventhly. That in article 3rd, section 2, the third clause be struck out, and in its place be inserted the classes following, to wit: . 

<br />The trial of all crimes (except in cases of impeachments, and cases arising in the land or naval forces, or the militia when on actual service in time of war or public danger) shall be by an impartial jury of freeholders of the vicinage, with the requisite of unanimity for conviction, of the right of challenge, and other accustomed requisites; and in all crimes punishable with loss of life or member, presentment or indictment by a grand jury shall be an essential preliminary, provided that in cases of crimes committed within any county which may be in possession of an enemy, or in which a general insurrection may prevail, the trial may by law be authorized in some other county of the same state, as near as may be to the seat of the offence.  . 

<br />In cases of crimes committed not within any county, the trial may by law be in such county as the laws shall have prescribed. In suits at common law, between man and man, the trial by jury, as one of the best securities to the rights of the people, ought to remain inviolate.  .

<br />The powers delegated by this constitution, are appropriated to the departments to which they are respectively distributed: so that the legislative department shall never exercise the powers vested in the executive or judicial; nor the executive exercise the powers vested in the legislative or judicial; nor the judicial exercise the powers vested in the legislative or executive departments.  . 

<br />The powers not delegated by this constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the States respectively.  .

</blockquote> . 

Madison's proposal was reworked and adopted as 17 Amendments by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on August 21, 1789, and forwarded to the Senate on August 24. The House version rejected Madison's idea to incorporate the amendments into the body of the Constitution and instead submitted it's 17 Articles to be attached separately "in addition to, and amendment of, the Constitution."   <ref>http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=rbpe&fileName=rbpe21/rbpe212/21200200/rbpe21200200.db&recNum=0&itemLink=r?ammem/rbpebib:@field(NUMBER+@band(rbpe+21200200))&linkText=0</ref>  . 

The Senate edited the House's proposed 17 Amendments and adopted a version with 12 Amendments. The two versions went to the Joint Committee and the Senate's version became the one adopted by [[joint resolution]] of Congress on September 25, 1789, to be forwarded to the states on September 28. <ref name="adamson2008p93"/><ref name="house1789p85"/><ref>{{cite book|title=Free, Sovereign, and Independent States: The Intended Meaning of the American Constitution|last=Graham|first=John Remington|year=2009|at=Footnote 54, pp. 193-194|others=Foreword by Laura Tesh|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7fOeMT99m44C&pg=PA193}}</ref> . 

===Early sentiments favoring expanding the Bill of Rights===. 
[[Image:Hamilton-Alexander-LOC.jpg|thumb|upright|A portrait of [[Alexander Hamilton]] shortly after the American Revolution]] . 

The idea of adding a bill of rights to the Constitution was originally controversial. [[Alexander Hamilton]], in ''[[Federalist Papers|Federalist]]'' [[Federalist No. 84|No. 84]], argued against a "Bill of Rights," asserting that ratification of the Constitution did not mean the American people were surrendering their rights, and, therefore, that protections were unnecessary: "Here, in strictness, the people surrender nothing, and as they retain everything, they have no need of particular reservations." Critics pointed out that earlier political documents had protected specific rights, but Hamilton argued that the Constitution was inherently different: . 

<blockquote>Bills of rights are in their origin, stipulations between kings and their subjects, abridgments of [[prerogative]] in favor of privilege, reservations of rights not surrendered to the prince. Such was <!--PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS A QUOTATION OF HAMILTON IN WHICH HE USED THE ALTERNATE SPELLING "MAGNA CHARTA" IT IS ''not'' A TYPO - PLEASE DO ''not'' MODIFY IT, THANKS!-->"[[Magna Carta|Magna Charta]]", obtained by the Barons, swords in hand, from [[John of England|King John]]. <ref name=why>Hamilton, Alexander. ''Federalist Papers'', #84. {{cite web|title=On opposition to a Bill of Rights.|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/bill_of_rightss7.html|accessdate=2006-02-28}}</ref> </blockquote> . 

Finally, Hamilton expressed the fear that protecting specific rights might imply that any unmentioned rights would not be protected:  <blockquote>I go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and in the extent in which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the proposed constitution, but would even be dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers which are not granted; and on this very account, would afford a colorable pretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do?<ref name=why/></blockquote> . 

Essentially, Hamilton and other Federalists believed in the British system of [[common law]] which did not define or quantify [[natural rights]]. They believed that adding a Bill of Rights to the Constitution would limit their rights to those listed in the Constitution. This is the primary reason the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] was included.  . 

[[Thomas Jefferson]] was a supporter of the Bill of Rights. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlyamerica.com/earlyamerica/freedom/bill/ |title=The Bill of Rights |publisher=Earlyamerica.com |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2010-05-15}}</ref>
[[George Mason]] "wished the plan [the Constitution] had been prefaced with a Bill of Rights."  [[Elbridge Gerry]] of Massachusetts "concurred in the idea & moved for a Committee to prepare a Bill of Rights."  [[Roger Sherman]] argued against a Bill of Rights stating that the "State Declarations of Rights are not repealed by this Constitution." Mason then stated "The Laws of the U. S. are to be paramount to State Bills of Rights." Gerry's motion was defeated with 10-Nays, 1-Absent, and No-Yeas. <ref>Farrand, Mas, [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1786&chapter=96172&layout=html&Itemid=27 The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, vol. 2] [1911], September 12, 1787</ref> .

[[Individualism]] was the strongest element of opposition; the necessity, or at least the desirability, of a bill of rights was almost universally felt, and the Anti-Federalists were able to play on these feelings in the ratification convention in [[Massachusetts]]. By this stage, five of the states had ratified the Constitution with relative ease; however, the Massachusetts convention was bitter and contentious: . 

<blockquote>In Massachusetts, the Constitution ran into serious, organized opposition. Only after two leading Anti-federalists, [[Samuel Adams|Adams]] and [[John Hancock|Hancock]], negotiated a far-reaching compromise did the convention vote for ratification on February 6, 1788 (187–168). Anti-federalists had demanded that the Constitution be amended before they would consider it or that amendments be a condition of ratification; Federalists had retorted that it had to be accepted or rejected as it was. Under the Massachusetts compromise, the delegates recommended amendments to be considered by the new Congress, should the Constitution go into force. The Massachusetts compromise determined the fate of the Constitution, as it permitted delegates with doubts to vote for it in the hope that it would be amended. <ref>Bernstein, Richard B. "Ratification of the Constitution."  {{cite web|title=''The Reader's Companion to American History''|url=http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/rcah/html/ah_073800_ratification.htm|accessdate=2006-02-28}}</ref></blockquote> . 

On September 17, 1787, the Constitution was completed, followed by a speech given by [[Benjamin Franklin]], who urged unanimity, although the Convention decided that only nine states were needed to ratify. The Convention submitted the Constitution to the [[Congress of the Confederation]]<ref name="National Archives Article on the Entire Constitutional Convention">{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters.html |title=National Archives Article on the Entire Constitutional Convention |accessdate=December 16, 2007 |author=[[National Archives and Records Administration|NARA]]}}</ref> . 

Massachusetts’ [[Rufus King]] assessed the Convention as a creature of the states, independent of the Articles Congress, submitting its proposal to Congress only to satisfy forms. Though amendments were debated, they were all defeated, and on September 28, 1787, the Articles Congress resolved “unanimously” to transmit the Constitution to state legislatures for submitting to a ratification convention according to the Constitutional procedure. <ref>Maier, Pauline. op. cit. p. 54-58. </ref> Several states enlarged the numbers qualified just for electing ratification delegates. In this they went beyond the Constitution's provision for the most voters for the state legislature to make a new social contract among, more nearly than ever before, "We, the people". <ref>Maier, Pauline. op. cit. p. 134, Connecticut expanded electorate to add all town meeting voters; p.140, Massachusetts dropped property requirements; p.218, New Hampshire dropped some property requirements, and added town delegates; p.223, Rhode Island put the question to a referendum which rejected the ratification convention, the Federalist minority centered in Newport and Providence boycotted the election; p.228, Virginia dropped “legal and Constitutional requirements” to expand the freehold electorate; p.327, New York dropped property requirements, timed assembly elections at the same time, and allowed up to five sequential days of voting until the voting rolls were “complete”. </ref> . 

Following Massachusetts' lead, the Federalist minorities in both Virginia and New York were able to obtain ratification in convention by linking ratification to recommended amendments. <ref name="MaierPauline_a">Maier, Pauline. op. cit. p. 431. </ref>  A minority of the Constitution’s critics continued to oppose the Constitution. Maryland’s [[Luther Martin]] argued that the federal convention had exceeded its authority; he still called for amending the Articles. <ref>Maier, Pauline. op. cit. p. 430. </ref> Article 13 of the Articles of Confederation stated that the union created under the Articles was "perpetual" and that any alteration must be "agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State". <ref name="Articles of Confederation">{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation|title=Articles of Confederation|accessdate=2009-07-18|author=[[WikiSource]]}}</ref> . 

However, the unanimous requirement under the Articles made all attempts at reform impossible. Martin’s allies such as New York’s [[John Lansing, Jr.]], dropped moves to obstruct the Convention's process. They began to take exception to the Constitution “as it was”, seeking amendments. Several conventions saw supporters for "amendments before" shift to a position of "amendments after" for the sake of staying in the Union. New York Anti’s “circular letter” was sent to each state legislature proposing a second constitutional convention for "amendments before". It failed in the state legislatures. Ultimately, only North Carolina and Rhode Island would wait for amendments from Congress before ratifying. <ref name="MaierPauline_a" /> . 

Article VII of the proposed constitution stipulated that only nine of the thirteen states would have to ratify for the new government to go into effect (for the participating states). After a year had passed in state-by-state ratification battles, on September 13, 1788, the Articles Congress certified that the new Constitution had been ratified. The new government would be inaugurated with eleven of the thirteen. The Articles Congress directed the new government to begin in New York City on the first Wednesday in March,<ref>Maier, Pauline. op. cit. p. 429. </ref> and on March 4, 1789, the [[Federal government of the United States|government]] duly began operations.  . 

[[George Washington]] had earlier been reluctant to go the Convention for fear the states “with their darling sovereignties” could not be overcome. <ref>Maier, Pauline. op. cit. p. 20. </ref> But he was elected the Constitution's President unanimously, including the vote of Virginia’s presidential elector, the Anti-federalist [[Patrick Henry]]. <ref>Maier, Pauline. op. cit. p. 438. </ref> The new Congress would be a triumph for the Federalists. The Senate of eleven states would be 20 Federalists to two Virginia (Henry) Anti-federalists. The House would seat 48 Federalists to 11 Antis from only four states: Massachusetts, New York, Virginia and South Carolina. <ref>Maier, Pauline. op. cit. p. 433. </ref> . 

Antis' fears of personal oppression by Congress would be allayed by Amendments passed under the floor leadership of [[James Madison]] in the first session of the first Congress. These first ten  Amendments ratified by the states were to become known as the [[Bill of Rights]]. <ref>Maier, Pauline. op. cit. p. 456. </ref>  Objections to a potentially remote federal judiciary would be reconciled with 13 federal courts (11 states, Maine and Kentucky), and three Federal riding circuits out of the Supreme Court: Eastern, Middle and South. <ref>Maier, Pauline. op. cit. p. 464. </ref> Suspicion of a powerful federal executive was answered by Washington’s cabinet appointments of once-Anti-Federalists [[Edmund Jennings Randolph]] as Attorney General and [[Thomas Jefferson]] as Secretary of State. <ref>{{cite web

Source: [[Library of Congress]]]] . 

Four of the next five states to ratify, including [[New Hampshire]], [[Virginia]], and [[New York]], included similar language in their ratification instruments. They all sent recommendations for amendments with their ratification documents to the new Congress. Since many of these recommendations pertained to safeguarding personal rights, this pressured Congress to add a Bill of Rights after Constitutional ratification. Additionally, [[North Carolina]] refused to ratify the Constitution until progress was made on the issue of the Bill of Rights. Thus, while the Anti-Federalists were unsuccessful in their quest to prevent the adoption of the Constitution, their efforts were not totally in vain.  . 

After the Constitution was ratified in 1789, the [[1st United States Congress]] met in [[Federal Hall]] in [[New York City]]. Most of the delegates agreed that a "bill of rights" was needed and most of them agreed on the rights they believed should be enumerated. 
[[Image:JamesMadison.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[James Madison]], "Father of the Constitution" and first author of the Bill of Rights]] . 

Madison, at the head of the Virginia delegation of the 1st Congress, had originally opposed a Bill of Rights but hoped to pre-empt a second [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|Constitutional Convention]] that might have undone the difficult compromises of 1787: a second convention would open the entire Constitution to reconsideration and could undermine the work he and so many others had done in establishing the structure of the U.S. Government. Writing to Jefferson, he stated, "The friends of the Constitution...wish the revisal to be carried no farther than to supply additional guards for liberty...and are fixed in opposition to the risk of another Convention....It is equally certain that there are others who urge a second Convention with the insidious hope of throwing all things into Confusion, and of subverting the fabric just established, if not the Union itself."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=1000 |title=Letter from James Madison to Thomas Jefferson (December 8, 1788) |publisher=Teachingamericanhistory.org |date=|accessdate=2011-06-04}}</ref> . 

Madison based much of the Bill of Rights on [[George Mason]]'s [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] (1776),<ref>"This uniquely influential document was also used by James Madison in drawing up the Bill of Rights (1789) and by the Marquis de Lafayette in drafting the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man]] (1789). "[http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/mason.html]</ref> which itself had been written with Madison's input. He carefully considered the state amendment recommendations as well. He looked for recommendations shared by many states to avoid controversy and reduce opposition to the ratification of the future amendments. <ref>Madison introduced "amendments culled mainly from state constitutions and state ratifying convention proposals, especially Virginia's."  Levy, Leonard W. ''Origins of the Bill of Rights''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999. ISBN 0-300-08901-5, p.35</ref>  Additionally, Madison's work on the Bill of Rights reflected centuries of English law and philosophy, further modified by the principles of the [[American Revolution]].  . 

==Ratification process==. 
On November 20, 1789, [[New Jersey]] became the first state to ratify these amendments. On December 15, 1791, ten of these proposals became the First through Tenth Amendments&nbsp;— and U.S. law&nbsp;— when they were ratified by the Virginia legislature.  .

Articles III to XII were ratified by 11/14 states (> 75%). [[Article the First|Article I]], rejected by [[Delaware]], was ratified only by 10/14 States (< 75%), and despite later ratification by [[Kentucky]] (11/15 states < 75%), the article has never since received the approval of enough states for it to become part of the Constitution. Article II was ratified by 6/14, later 7/15 states, but did not receive the 3/4 majority of States needed for ratification until 1992 when it became the [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|27th Amendment]].  . 

===Later consideration===. 
Lawmakers in Kentucky, which became the [[List of U.S. states by date of statehood|15th state to join the Union]] in June 1792, ratified the entire set of twelve proposals during that [[commonwealth (United States)|commonwealth]]'s initial month of statehood, perhaps unaware&nbsp;— given the nature of long-distance communications in the 1700s&nbsp;— that Virginia's approval six months earlier had already made ten of the package of twelve part of the Constitution.  . 

Although ratification made the Bill of Rights effective in 1791, three of the original thirteen states&nbsp;— [[Connecticut]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Massachusetts]]&nbsp;— did not ratify the first ten amendments until 1939, when they were urged to do so in a celebration of the 150th anniversary of their passage by Congress. <ref>{{cite web|title=Order and Dates of Ratification of the Bill of Rights.|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendments.html|date=2006-02-28}}</ref> .

===The Bill of Rights===. 
[[Image:Bill of Rights Pg1of1 AC.jpg|200px|thumb|'''United States Bill of Rights''' currently housed in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]].]] . 

It is commonly understood that originally the Bill of Rights was not intended to apply to the states; however, there is no such limit in the text itself, except where an amendment refers specifically to the federal government.  One example is the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], which says only that "Congress shall make no law...", and under which some states in the early years of the nation officially [[state religion|established a religion]]. A rule of inapplicability to the states remained until 1868, when the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] was passed, which stated, in part, that: . 

{{quote|No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.}} . 

The Supreme Court has interpreted this clause to extend most, but not all, parts of the Bill of Rights to the states, a process known as [[incorporation of the Bill of Rights]]. The balance of state and federal power under the incorporation doctrine is still an open question and continues to be fought separately for each right in the federal courts.  . 

The amendments that became the Bill of Rights were the last ten of the twelve amendments proposed in 1789. The second of the twelve proposed amendments, regarding the compensation of members of Congress, remained unratified until 1992, when the legislatures of enough states finally approved it; as a result, after pending for two centuries, it became the [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-seventh Amendment]].  . 

The [[Article the First|first of the twelve]], which is still technically pending before the state legislatures for ratification, pertains to the apportionment of the [[United States House of Representatives]] after each decennial [[United States Census|census]]. The most recent state whose lawmakers are known to have ratified this proposal is [[Kentucky]] in 1792, during that commonwealth's first month of statehood.  . 

*[[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]: addresses the rights of [[Freedom of religion in the United States|freedom of religion]] (prohibiting Congress from [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|making a law "respecting an establishment" of religion]] and protecting the right to [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|free exercise of religion]]), [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of the press]], [[freedom of assembly]], and [[freedom of petition]]. 
*[[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]]: guarantees the right of individuals to possess weapons.  The most recent Supreme Court decision interpreting the Second Amendment is ''[[McDonald v. Chicago]]''. 
*[[Third Amendment to the United States Constitution|Third Amendment]]: prohibits the government from using private homes as quarters for soldiers during peacetime without the consent of the owners. The only existing case law directly regarding this amendment is a decision of the Court of Appeals (the appellate level between the U.S. District Court and the U.S. Supreme Court) in the case of ''[[Engblom v. Carey]]''. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment03/ |title=Findlaw.com |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref> However, it is also cited in the landmark case, ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', in support of the Supreme Court's holding that the constitution protects the right to personal privacy. 
*[[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]: guards against [[search and seizure|searches, arrests, and seizures]] of [[property]] without a specific warrant or a "[[probable cause]]" to believe a crime has been committed. Some rights to privacy have been inferred from this amendment and others by the Supreme Court. 
*[[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]: forbids [[trial (law)|trial]] for a major [[crime]] except after [[indictment]] by a [[grand jury]]; prohibits [[double jeopardy]] (repeated trials), except in certain very limited circumstances; forbids punishment without [[due process]] of law; and provides that an accused person may not be compelled to [[self-incrimination|testify against himself]] (this is also known as "[[Taking the Fifth]]" or "Pleading the Fifth"). This is regarded as the "rights of the accused" amendment, otherwise known as the [[Miranda rights]] after the Supreme Court case. It also prohibits government from taking private property for public use without "[[just compensation]]", the basis of [[eminent domain]] in the United States. 
*[[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]]: guarantees a speedy public trial for criminal offenses. It requires trial by a [[jury]], guarantees the right to [[legal counsel]] for the accused, and guarantees that the accused may require [[witness]]es to attend the trial and testify in the presence of the accused. It also guarantees the accused a right to know the charges against him. The Sixth Amendment has several court cases associated with it, including ''[[Powell v. Alabama]]'', ''[[United States v. Wong Kim Ark]]'', ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'', and ''[[Crawford v. Washington]]''. In 1966, the Supreme Court ruled that the fifth amendment prohibition on forced self-incrimination and the sixth amendment clause on right to counsel were to be made known to all persons placed under arrest, and these clauses have become known as the [[Miranda warning|Miranda rights]]. 
*[[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]]: assures trial by jury in [[civil law (common law)|civil cases]]. 
*[[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]]: forbids excessive [[bail]] or [[fine (penalty)|fine]]s, and [[cruel and unusual punishment]]. 
*[[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]]: declares that the listing of individual rights in the Constitution and Bill of Rights is not meant to be comprehensive; and that the other rights not specifically mentioned are retained by the people. 
*[[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]]: reserves to the states respectively, or to the people, any powers the Constitution did not delegate to the United States, nor prohibit the states from exercising.  .

==Excluded from The Bill of Rights==. 
{{Main|Incorporation of the Bill of Rights}}
Originally, the Bill of Rights restrictions applied only to the federal government and not to the state governments. Parts of the amendments originally proposed by Madison that would have limited state governments ("No state shall violate the equal rights of conscience, or the freedom of the press, or the trial by jury in criminal cases.") were not approved by Congress, and therefore the Bill of Rights did not apply to the powers of state governments. <ref>Bent, Devin. {{cite web|title=James Madison proposes Bill of Rights.|url=http://www.jmu.edu/madison/center/main_pages/madison_archives/constit_confed/rights/jmproposal/jmproposal.htm|accessdate=2006-02-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050320091747/http://www.jmu.edu/madison/center/main_pages/madison_archives/constit_confed/rights/jmproposal/jmproposal.htm |archivedate = March 20, 2005}}</ref> . 

States had established [[state religion|state churches]] up until the 1820s, and [[Southern United States|Southern states]], beginning in the 1830s, could ban [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] literature. In the 1833 case ''[[Barron v. Baltimore]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] specifically ruled that the Bill of Rights provided "security against the apprehended encroachments of the general government—not against those of local governments." In the ''[[Gitlow v. New York]], 268 U.S. 652, (1925)'' case, the Supreme Court ruled that the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which had been adopted in 1868, could make certain applications of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states.  However, the [[Gitlow]] case stated (p.&nbsp;666): "For present purposes we may and do presume that freedom of speech and of the press&nbsp;— which are protected by the First Amendment from abridgment by Congress&nbsp;— are among the fundamental personal rights and 'liberties' protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from impairment by the States."  However at p.&nbsp;668, the Court held: "It does not protect publications prompting the overthrow of government by force", which Gitlow and associates advocated in their publications. The Supreme Court has cited ''Gitlow v. New York'' as precedent for a series of decisions that made most, but not all, of the provisions of the Bill of Rights restrictions applicable to the states under the doctrine of ''selective incorporation''.  . 

The Bill of Rights applied to white men who owned property and excluded most Americans. Free blacks were excluded from The Bill of Rights because they were not citizens. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davekopel.com/NRO/2000/Dread-the-Dred-Scott-Reference.htm |title=Dread the Dred Scott Reference |publisher=Davekopel.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref> Also excluded were all women, Native Americans, immigrants and white men who did not own land.  . 

==Display and honoring of the Bill of Rights==. 
In 1941, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] declared December 15 to be Bill of Rights Day, commemorating the 150th anniversary of the ratification of the Bill of Rights.  . 

The Bill of Rights is on display at the [[National Archives and Records Administration]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/trt013.html|title=American Treasures of the Library of Congress|date=2006-03-13}}</ref> in the Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom.  . 

The Rotunda itself was constructed in the 1950s and dedicated in 1952 by President [[Harry S. Truman]], who said, "Only as these documents are reflected in the thoughts and acts of Americans, can they remain symbols of power that can move the world. That power is our faith in human liberty ...."<ref>{{cite web|title=Truman's Remarks in the Rotunda, December 1952|date=2006-03-14|url=http://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/visit/truman_transcript.html}}
</ref> . 

After fifty years, signs of deterioration in the casing were noted, while the documents themselves appeared to be well-preserved: "But if the ink of 1787 was holding its own, the encasements of 1951 were not ... minute crystals and microdroplets of liquid were found on surfaces of the two glass sheets over each document.... The CMS scans confirmed evidence of progressive glass deterioration, which was a major impetus in deciding to re-encase the Charters of Freedom."<ref>Mary Lynn Ritzenthaler and Catherine Nicholson, {{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/charters_preservation_01.html
|title=A New Era Begins for the Charters of Freedom.|date=2006-03-14}} ''Prologue'', Fall 2003. </ref> . 

Accordingly, the casing was updated and the Rotunda rededicated on September 17, 2003. In his dedicatory remarks, two hundred and sixteen years after the close of the Constitutional Convention, President [[George W. Bush]] stated, "The true [American] revolution was not to defy one earthly power, but to declare principles that stand above every earthly power—the equality of each person before God, and the responsibility of government to secure the rights of all."<ref>{{cite web|title=Remarks by President George W. Bush at the Rededication of the National Archives.|url=http://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/news/visit_reopening_remarks_bush.html|date=2006-03-14}}</ref> . 

In 1991, the Bill of Rights toured the country in honor of its bicentennial, visiting the capitals of all fifty states.  .
