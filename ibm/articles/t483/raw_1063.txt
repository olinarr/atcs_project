The '''Global Network Initiative''' ('''GNI''') is a [[non-governmental organization]] with the dual goals of preventing [[Internet censorship]] by [[authoritarian]] [[government]]s and protecting the [[Internet privacy]] rights of individuals. It is sponsored by a coalition of [[multinational corporation]]s, [[non-profit organization]]s, and [[universities]].  . 

==History== . 

On October 29, 2008 the Global Network Initiative (GNI) was founded upon its "Principles of Freedom of Expression and Privacy".{{citequote}}  The Initiative was launched in the 60th Anniversary year of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and is based on internationally recognized laws and standards for [[human rights]] on [[freedom of expression]] and [[privacy]] set out in the UDHR, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR). <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/faq/index.php |title=Global Network Initiative, FAQ|accessdate=March 6, 2009}}</ref> . 

==Profile== . 

As a human rights organization, the Global Network Initiative (GNI) seeks to safeguard freedom of expression and personal privacy against government restrictions. The protections are facilitated by a coalition of companies, investors, civil society organizations, academics, and other stakeholders.  . 

The Global Network Initiative esteems freedom of expression and privacy each as a “human right and guarantor of human dignity.”<ref>{{cite web|title=Global Network Initiative - Principles|url=http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/principles/index.php|accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref>  Participants are expected to respect and protect information available to users and users’ ability to freely create and distribute information, provided that they operate outside narrowly defined circumstances necessary to adhere to international laws and standards set by the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR).  . 

Participants are also expected to protect users’ personal information from illegal or arbitrary interference when confronted with government demands, laws, or regulations that compromise a user’s privacy. The same principle of adherence of international laws and standards applies.  . 

Collaboration among stakeholders is key to the goals of the Global Network Initiative. The GNI's outline of principles encourages participants to explore ways to engage governments advance their cause, individually or collectively. <ref>{{cite web|title=Principles: Multi-stakeholder collaboration|url=http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/principles/index.php#21|accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref> . 

The Global Network Initiative recognizes that the actions of their corporate participants alone cannot guarantee the protection of human rights. One fundamental commitment is to promote the adoption of laws, policies, and practices that protect freedom of expression and privacy. The GNI considers governments to be ultimately responsible for the fulfillment of their citizens' human rights, specifically pursuant to freedom of expression and privacy. <ref>{{cite web|title=FAQ: How will the Global Network Initiative accomplish its goals?|url=http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/faq/index.php#48|accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref> .

==Participants==. 
The Global Network Initiative requires participating companies to integrate their principles deeply into their decision-making and culture. <ref>{{cite web|title=Principles: Responsible Company Decision Making|url=http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/principles/index.php#20|accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref>  The GNI struggles to get large corporate participants other than the initial three, [[Google]], [[Yahoo!]], and [[Microsoft]]. [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] are valuable for their large audiences and wide use by activists in the [[Middle East]] and other volatile regions. The reasons they will not join remain vague from spokespersons or entirely unspecified, but factors like the toughness of the independent auditing process or the lack of financial benefit may engender corporate reluctance. <ref>{{cite news|last=Kopytoff|first=Verne G.|title=Sites Like Twitter Absent From Free Speech Pact|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/07/technology/07rights.html?_r=1|accessdate=26 April 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 March 2011}}</ref> .
