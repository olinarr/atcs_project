'''Censorship''' is the suppression of speech or other public communication which may be considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, or inconvenient to the general body of people as determined by a government, media outlet, or other controlling body.  . 

==Rationale==. 
The rationale for censorship is different for various types of information censored:
* Moral censorship is the removal of materials that are [[Obscenity|obscene]] or otherwise considered morally questionable. [[Pornography]], for example, is often censored under this rationale, especially [[child pornography]], which is illegal and censored in most jurisdictions in the world. <ref>http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/documents/CP_Legislation_Report.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csecworldcongress.org/en/index.htm |title=World Congress against CSEC |publisher=Csecworldcongress.org |date=2002-07-27 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref>
* Military censorship is the process of keeping [[military intelligence]] and [[military tactics|tactics]] confidential and away from the enemy. This is used to counter [[espionage]], which is the process of gleaning military information. 
* [[Political censorship]] occurs when governments hold back information from their citizens. This is often done to exert control over the populace and prevent free expression that might foment [[rebellion]]. 
* [[Censorship by religion|Religious censorship]] is the means by which any material considered objectionable by a certain faith is removed. This often involves a dominant religion forcing limitations on less prevalent ones. Alternatively, one religion may shun the works of another when they believe the content is not appropriate for their faith. 
* [[Corporate censorship]] is the process by which editors in corporate media outlets intervene to disrupt the publishing of information that portrays their business or business partners in a negative light,<ref name=Jay>{{cite book|title=Why We Curse: A Neuro-psycho-social Theory of Speech|author=Timothy Jay|year=2000|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=1556197586|pages=208–209}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Regulating the Changing Media: A Comparative Study|author= David Goldberg, Stefaan G.

==Types==. 
===Political===. 
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=left|image1=Voroshilov, Molotov, Stalin, with Nikolai Yezhov.jpg|image2=The Commissar Vanishes 2.jpg|caption2=[[Nikolai Yezhov]], standing to the right of [[Joseph Stalin]], was shot in 1940.

Strict censorship existed in the Eastern Bloc. <ref name="major6">{{Harvnb|Major|Mitter|2004|p=6}}</ref> Throughout the bloc, the various ministries of culture held a tight rein on their writers. <ref name="major15">{{Harvnb|Major|Mitter|2004|p=15}}</ref> Cultural products there reflected the propaganda needs of the state. <ref name="major15"/> Party-approved censors exercised strict control in the early years. <ref name="crampton247">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=247}}</ref> In the Stalinist period, even the weather forecasts were changed if they had the temerity to suggest that the sun might not shine on [[May Day]]. <ref name="crampton247"/> Under [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] in [[People's Republic of Romania|Romania]], weather reports were doctored so that the temperatures were not seen to rise above or fall below the levels which dictated that work must stop. <ref name="crampton247"/> . 

Independent journalism did not exist in the [[Soviet Union]] until [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became its leader; all reporting was directed by the [[Communist Party]] or related organizations. [[Pravda]], the predominant newspaper in the Soviet Union, had a monopoly. Foreign newspapers were available only if they were published by [[Communist Parties]] sympathetic to the Soviet Union.  . 

Possession and use of [[copy machine|copying machines]] was tightly controlled in order to hinder production and distribution of [[samizdat]], illegal [[self-publishing|self-published]] books and magazines. <!-- Page 308 ISBN 0886876540 --> Possession of even a single samizdat manuscript such as a book by [[Andrei Sinyavsky]] was a serious crime which might involve a visit from the [[KGB]]. <!--Page 309 ISBN 0886876540 -->Another outlet for works which did not find favor with the authorities was publishing abroad.  . 

The [[Censorship in the People's Republic of China|People's Republic of China]] employs sophisticated censorship mechanisms, referred to as the [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China#Golden Shield Project|Golden Shield Project]], to monitor the internet. Popular search engines such as [[Baidu]] also remove politically sensitive search results. <ref>[http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2009/04/baidus-internal-monitoring-and-censorship-document-leaked/ Baidu’s Internal Monitoring and Censorship Document Leaked (1)], Xiao Qiang, ''China Digital Times'', April 30, 2009<br />[http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2009/04/baidus-internal-monitoring-and-censorship-document-leaked-2/ Baidu’s Internal Monitoring and Censorship Document Leaked (2)]<br />[http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2009/04/baidus-internal-monitoring-and-censorship-document-leaked-3/ Baidu’s Internal Monitoring and Censorship Document Leaked (3)]</ref> . 

Iraq under [[Baathist]] [[Saddam Hussein]] had much the same techniques of press censorship as did Romania under [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] but with greater potential violence.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} . 

Cuban media is operated under the supervision of the [[Communist Party of Cuba|Communist Party's]] ''Department of Revolutionary Orientation'', which "develops and coordinates propaganda strategies". <ref name="CPJ-2006">{{cite web|url=http://www.cpj.org/censored/censored_06.html|title=10 most censored countries|publisher=The Committee to Protect Journalists}}</ref> Connection to the Internet is restricted and censored. <ref name="cubaonline">{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/rapport_gb_md_1.pdf|title=Going online in Cuba: Internet under surveillance|publisher=Reporters Without Borders|year=2006}}</ref> . 

Censorship also takes place in capitalist nations, such as Uruguay. In 1973, a military coup took power in Uruguay, and the State practiced censorship. For example, writer [[Eduardo Galeano]] was imprisoned and later was forced to flee. His book [[Open Veins of Latin America]] was banned by the right-wing military government, not only in Uruguay, but also in Chile and Argentina. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/5/28/eduardo |title=Fresh Off Worldwide Attention for Joining Obama's Book Collection, Uruguayan Author Eduardo Galeano Returns with "Mirrors: Stories of Almost Everyone" |publisher=Democracynow.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref> . 

Critics of the [[Campaign finance reform]] in the United States claim that this reform imposes widespread restrictions on political speech. <ref name="The Trick of Campaign Finance Reform">{{cite web|url=http://www.giantleap.org/envision/campaign.htm|title=The Trick of Campaign Finance Reform|publisher=Christian Science Monitor}}</ref><ref name="Felonious Advocacy">{{cite web|url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/132594.html|title=Felonious Advocacy|publisher=reason}}</ref> . 

===State secrets and prevention of attention===. 
[[Image:CensoredRhodesiaHerald.jpg|left|thumb|The ''[[Rhodesia Herald]]'' of September 21, 1966.]]
[[Image:WieczorWroclawia20marca1981.jpg|thumb|''[[Wieczór Wrocławia]]'' - Daily newspaper of [[Wrocław]], [[People's Republic of Poland]], March 20–21, 1981, with censor intervention on first and last pages --- under the headlines "Co zdarzyło się w Bydgoszczy?" ([[Bydgoszcz events|What happened in Bydgoszcz?]]) and "Pogotowie strajkowe w całym kraju" (Country-wide strike alert). The censor had removed a section regarding the strike alert; hence the workers in the printing house blanked out an official propaganda section. The right-hand page also includes a hand-written confirmation of that decision by the local [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|"Solidarność" Trade Union]].]] . 

In wartime, explicit censorship is carried out with the intent of preventing the release of information that might be useful to an enemy. Typically it involves keeping times or locations secret, or delaying the release of information (e.g., an operational objective) until it is of no possible use to enemy forces. The moral issues here are often seen as somewhat different, as the proponents of this form of censorship argues that release of tactical information usually presents a greater risk of casualties among one's own forces and could possibly lead to loss of the overall conflict.  . 

During [[World War I]] letters written by British soldiers would have to go through censorship. This consisted of officers going through letters with a black marker and crossing out anything which might compromise operational secrecy before the letter was sent. The [[World War II]] catchphrase "[[British propaganda during World War II|Loose lips sink ships]]" was used as a common justification to exercise official wartime censorship and encourage individual restraint when sharing potentially sensitive information.  . 

An example of "[[sanitization (classified information)|sanitization]]" policies comes from the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] under [[Joseph Stalin]], where publicly used photographs were often altered to remove people whom Stalin had condemned to execution. Though past photographs may have been remembered or kept, this deliberate and systematic alteration to all of history in the public mind is seen as one of the central themes of [[Stalinism]] and [[totalitarianism]].  . 

Censorship is occasionally carried out to aid authorities or to protect an individual, as with some kidnappings when attention and media coverage of the victim can sometimes be seen as unhelpful. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/29/technology/internet/29wiki.html_r=1&ref=todayspaper New York Times]</ref><ref>[http://rawstory.com/news/afp/Cat_and_mouse_at_Wikipedia_over_NYT_06292009.html The Raw Story | Investigative News and Politics]</ref> . 

{{-}}
===Religion===. 
{{Main|Censorship by religion}}
Censorship by religion is a form of censorship where [[freedom of expression]] is controlled or limited using [[religious authority]] or on the basis of the teachings of the [[religion]]. This form of censorship has a long history and is practiced in many societies and by many religions. Examples include the  [[Edict of Compiègne]], the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] (list of prohibited books) and the condemnation of [[Salman Rushdie]]'s novel ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' by [[Iran]]ian leader [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]].  . 

===Educational sources===. 
[[File:Grech old russian censorship.jpg|thumb|Historic [[russia]]n censorship. Book "Notes of my life by N.I. Grech", published in St. Petersburg 1886 by A.S. Suvorin. The censored text was replaced by dots.]] . 

The content of school textbooks is often the issue of debate, since their target audience is young people, and the term "whitewashing" is the one commonly used to refer to removal of critical or conflicting events. The [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|reporting of military atrocities in history]] is extremely controversial, as in the case of [[The Holocaust]] (or [[Holocaust denial]]), [[Bombing of Dresden]], the [[Nanking Massacre]] as found with [[Japanese history textbook controversies]], the [[Armenian Genocide]], the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], and the [[Winter Soldier Investigation]] of the [[Vietnam War]].  . 

In the context of [[secondary school]] education, the way facts and [[history]] are presented greatly influences the interpretation of contemporary thought, opinion and socialization. One argument for censoring the type of information disseminated is based on the inappropriate quality of such material for the young. The use of the "inappropriate" distinction is in itself controversial, as it changed heavily. A Ballantine Books version of the book [[Fahrenheit 451]] which is the version used by most school classes<ref>Bradbury, Ray. ''Fahrenheit 451''. Del Rey Books. April 1991. </ref> contained approximately 75 separate edits, omissions, and changes from the original Bradbury manuscript.  .

===Copy, picture, and writer approval===. 
Copy approval is the right to read and amend an article, usually an interview, before publication. Many publications refuse to give copy approval but it is increasingly becoming common practice when dealing with publicity anxious celebrities. <ref>{{cite news |title=The readers' editor on requests that are always refused |author=Ian Mayes |date=2005-04-23 |publisher=The Guardian |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1468351,00.html |accessdate=August 2007-01-21 | location=London}}</ref> Picture approval is the right given to an individual to choose which photos will be published and which will not.

Hollywood publicist Pat Kingsley is known for banning certain writers who wrote undesirably about one of her clients from interviewing any of her other clients.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} . 

===Creative censorship===. 
There are many ways that censors exhibit creativity, but a specific variant is of concern in which censors rewrite texts, giving these texts secret co-authors. This form of censorship is used in the novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}{{Or|date=April 2011}} . 

==Censorship by medium==. 
===Books===. 
{{Main|Book censorship}}
Book censorship can be enacted at the national or sub-national level, and can carry legal penalties for their infraction. Books may also be [[Challenge (literature)|challenged]] at a local, community level. As a result, books can be removed from schools or libraries, although these bans do not extend outside of that area.  . 

===Films===. 
{{Main|Film censorship}}
Aside from the usual justifications of pornography, language and violence, some films are censored due to changing racial attitudes or [[political correctness]] in order to avoid [[ethnic stereotype|ethnic stereotyping]] and/or ethnic offense despite its historical or artistic value. One example is the still withdrawn "[[Censored Eleven]]" series of animated cartoons, which may have been innocent then, but are "incorrect" now.  . 

===Music===. 
{{Main|Censorship of music}}
Music censorship has been implemented by states, religions, educational systems, families, retailers and lobbying groups – and in most cases they violate international conventions of human rights. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freemuse.org/sw2338.asp |title=What is Music Censorship? |publisher=Freemuse.org |date=1 January 2001 |accessdate=2008-10-25}}</ref> .

Censorship of maps is often employed for military purposes. For example, the technique was used in former [[East Germany]], especially for the areas near the border to [[West Germany]] in order to make attempts of [[defection]] more difficult. Censorship of maps is also applied by [[Google maps]], where certain areas are grayed out or blacked or areas are purposely left out-dated with old imagery. <ref name="WashingtonPost">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/21/AR2007072101296.html|title=Google's View of D.C.

Internet censorship is control or suppression of the publishing or accessing of information on the [[Internet]]. It may be carried out by governments or by private organizations either at the behest of government or on their own initiative. Individuals and organizations may engage in [[self-censorship]] on their own or due to intimidation and fear.  . 

The issues associated with Internet censorship are similar to those for offline censorship of more traditional media. One difference is that national borders are more permeable online: residents of a country that bans certain information can find it on [[website]]s hosted outside the country. Thus censors must work to prevent access to information even though they lack physical or legal control over the websites themselves. This in turn requires the use of technical censorship methods that are unique to the Internet, such as site blocking and content filtering. <ref name=UNESCO-2011>[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/publications-and-communication-materials/publications/full-list/freedom-of-connection-freedom-of-expression-the-changing-legal-and-regulatory-ecology-shaping-the-internet/ ''Freedom of connection, freedom of expression: the changing legal and regulatory ecology shaping the Internet''], Dutton, William H.; Dopatka, Anna; Law, Ginette; Nash, Victoria, Division for Freedom of Expression, Democracy and Peace, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Paris, 2011, 103 pp., ISBN 978-92-3-104188-4</ref> . 

Unless the censor has total control over all Internet-connected computers, such as in [[Internet censorship in North Korea|North Korea]] or [[Internet censorship in cuba|Cuba]], total censorship of information is very difficult or impossible to achieve due to the underlying distributed technology of the Internet. [[Pseudonymity]] and [[data haven]]s (such as [[Freenet]]) protect [[free speech]] using technologies that guarantee material cannot be removed and prevents the identification of authors. Technologically savvy users can often find ways to [[Internet censorship circumvention|access blocked content]]. Nevertheless, blocking remains an effective means of limiting access to sensitive information for most users when censors, such as those in [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|China]], are able to devote significant resources to building and maintaining a comprehensive censorship system. <ref name=UNESCO-2011/> . 

Views about the feasibility and effectiveness of Internet censorship have evolved in parallel with the development of the Internet and censorship technologies:
* A 1993 ''Time Magazine'' article quotes computer scientist [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gillmore]], one of the founders of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], as saying "The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it."<ref>[http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/outerspace/internet-article.html "First Nation in Cyberspace"], Philip Elmer-Dewitt, ''Time'', 6 December 1993, No.49</ref>
* In November 2007, "Father of the Internet" [[Vint Cerf]] stated that he sees government control of the Internet failing because the Web is almost entirely privately owned. <ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/reutersEdge/idUSN1420689320071114?sp=true "Cerf sees government control of Internet failing"], Pedro Fonseca, Reuters, 14 November 2007</ref>
* A report of research conducted in 2007 and published in 2009 by the Beckman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University stated that: "We are confident that the [censorship circumvention] tool developers will for the most part keep ahead of the governments' blocking efforts", but also that "...we believe that less than two percent of all filtered Internet users use circumvention tools". <ref>[http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/sites/cyber.law.harvard.edu/files/2007_Circumvention_Landscape.pdf ''2007 Circumvention Landscape Report: Methods, Uses, and Tools''], Hal Roberts, Ethan Zuckerman, and John Palfrey, Beckman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University, March 2009</ref>
* In contrast, a 2011 report by researchers at the [[Oxford Internet Institute]] published by [[UNESCO]] concludes "... the control of information on the Internet and Web is certainly feasible, and technological advances do not therefore guarantee greater freedom of speech."<ref name=UNESCO-2011/> . 

A [[Internet censorship#BBC World Service global public opinion poll|BBC World Service poll]] of 27,973 adults in 26 countries, including 14,306 Internet users,<ref>For the BBC poll Internet users are those who used the Internet within the previous six months. </ref> was conducted between 30 November 2009 and 7 February 2010. The head of the polling organization felt, overall, that the poll showed that:
:Despite worries about privacy and fraud, people around the world see access to the internet as their fundamental right. They think the web is a force for good, and most don’t want governments to regulate it. <ref name=BBCPoll-2010>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/08_03_10_BBC_internet_poll.pdf "BBC Internet Poll: Detailed Findings"], BBC World Service, 8 March 2010</ref>
The poll found that nearly four in five (78%) Internet users felt that the Internet had brought them greater freedom, that most Internet users (53%) felt that "the internet should never be regulated by any level of government anywhere", and almost four in five Internet users and non-users around the world felt that access to the Internet was a fundamental right (50% strongly agreed, 29% somewhat agreed, 9% somewhat disagreed, 6% strongly disagreed, and 6% gave no opinion). <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8548190.stm "Internet access is 'a fundamental right'"], ''BBC News'', 8 March 2010</ref>

==Implementation==. 
[[Image:Censuraindex.jpg|thumb|Censored pre-press proof of two articles from "[[Notícias da Amadora]]", a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] newspaper, 1970]]
The former [[Soviet Union]] maintained a particularly extensive program of state-imposed censorship. The main organ for official censorship in the Soviet Union was the ''Chief Agency for Protection of Military and State Secrets'' generally known as the ''[[Main Administration for Safeguarding State Secrets in the Press|Glavlit]]'', its Russian acronym. The ''Glavlit'' handled censorship matters arising from domestic writings of just about any kind—even beer and vodka labels. ''Glavlit'' censorship personnel were present in every large Soviet publishing house or newspaper; the agency employed some 70,000 censors to review information before it was disseminated by publishing houses, editorial offices, and broadcasting studios. No mass medium escaped ''Glavlit'''s control. All press agencies and radio and television stations had ''Glavlit'' representatives on their editorial staffs.  . 

Sometimes, a specific and unique information whose very existence is barely known to the public, is kept in a subtle, near-censorship situation, being regarded as "[[subversion (politics)|subversive]]" or "inconvenient". [[Michel Foucault]]'s 1978 text "[[Sexual Morality and the Law]]" (later republished as "The Danger of Child Sexuality"), for instance - originally published as ''La loi de la pudeur'' &#91;literally, "the law of decency"&#93;, defends the decriminalization of [[statutory rape]] and the [[age of consent reform|abolition of age of consent laws]].  . 

When a publisher comes under pressure to suppress a book, but has already entered into a contract with the author, they will sometimes effectively censor the book by deliberately ordering a small print run and making minimal, if any, attempts to publicize it. This practice became known in the early 2000s as ''privishing''. <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0711-05.htm | title=Journalists Thrown 'Into the Buzzsaw' | last=Winkler | first=David |date=11 July 2002| publisher=CommonDreams.org}}</ref> . 

==Censorship by country==. 
{{Main|Censorship by country}}
Censorship by country collects information on censorship, [[Internet censorship]], [[Freedom of the Press]], [[Freedom of speech]], and [[Human Rights]] by country and presents it in a sortable table, together with links to articles with more information. In addition to countries, the table includes information on former countries, disputed countries, political sub-units within countries, and regional organizations.
