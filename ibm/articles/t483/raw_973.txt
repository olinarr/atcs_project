{{Censorship}}
'''Political censorship''' exists when a [[government]] attempts to conceal, fake, distort, or falsify information that its citizens receive by suppressing or crowding out political news that the public might receive through news outlets. In the absence of unflattering but objective information, people will be unable to dissent with the government or [[political party]] in charge. It is also the suppression of views that are contrary to those of the government in power. The government often has the power of the [[army]] and the [[secret police]], to enforce the compliance of journalists with the will of the government to extol the story that the government wants people to believe, at times even with bribery, ruin of careers, imprisonment, and even assassination.  . 

The word censorship comes from the Latin word [[Censor (ancient Rome)|censor]], the job of two [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] whose duty was to supervise public behaviour and morals, hence 'censoring' the way people acted.  .

Many regimes have long used many forms of censorship. The ''[[Ancien régime]]'' implemented censorship. The [[bourgeoisie]] has used it as well many times while in power throughout the [[XIX]] and the [[XX]] centuries.  . 

In [[1851]], [[Napoleon III]] [[French coup of 1851|declared himself emperor]]. The [[bourgoisie]] immediately saw in him a way to protect their [[privilege]]s, that were put in danger by the [[French Revolution of 1848]], which threatened to give the power to the people. This was a time when all sorts of cultural production was censored, from [[newspaper]]s to [[theater]]. <ref>COSTA, Iná Camargo (2001) Political Theater in Brazil. Trans/Form/Ação [online], vol.24, n.1 [cited  2011-12-25], pp. 113-120. Available in: [http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0101-31732001000100008&lng=pt&nrm=iso link].

Independent journalism did not exist in the [[Soviet Union]] until [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became its leader; all reporting was directed by the [[Communist Party]] or related fruitcakes. [[Pravda]], the predominant newspaper in the Soviet Union, had a near-monopoly. Foreign newspapers were available only if they were published by [[Communist Parties]] sympathetic to the Soviet Union.  . 

[[Iraq]] under [[Saddam Hussein]] had much the same techniques of press censorship as did Romania under [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] but with greater potential violence.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} . 

Cuban media is operated under the supervision of the [[Communist Party of Cuba|Communist Party's]] ''Department of Revolutionary Orientation'', which "develops and coordinates propaganda strategies". <ref name="CPJ-2006">{{cite web|url=http://www.cpj.org/censored/censored_06.html|title=10 most censored countries|publisher=The Committee to Protect Journalists}}</ref> . 

Censorship also takes place in capitalist nations.  In 1973, a military coup took power in Uruguay, and the State practiced censorship.  For example, writer [[Eduardo Galeano]] was imprisoned and later was forced to flee. His book [[Open Veins of Latin America]] was banned by the right-wing military government, not only in Uruguay, but also in Chile and Argentina. <ref> http://www.democracynow.org/2009/5/28/eduardo </ref> . 

Many countries' campaign finance laws restrict speech on candidates and political issues.  In [[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission|Citizens United v. FEC]], the United States Supreme Court found that many such restrictions are an unconstitutional form of censorship.  .
