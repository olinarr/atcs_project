'''[[Open-source]] software''' ('''OSS''') is [[computer software]] that is available in source code form: the [[source code]] and certain other rights normally reserved for [[copyright]] holders are provided under an [[open-source license]] that permits users to study, change, improve and at times also to distribute the software.  . 

Open source software is very often developed in a public, [[Collaborative software development model|collaborative]] manner. Open-source software is the most prominent example of [[open source|open-source]] development and often compared to (technically defined) [[user-generated content]] or (legally defined) [[open content]] movements. <ref>{{cite web

==History==. 
{{Main|Open source movement}} . 

The [[free software movement]] was launched in 1983. In 1998, a group of individuals advocated that the term free software should be replaced by open source software (OSS) as an expression which is less ambiguous and more comfortable for the corporate world. <ref>{{cite web

Open source software generally allows anyone to create modifications of the software, port it to new operating systems and processor architectures, share it with others or, in some cases, market it.  Scholars Casson and Ryan have pointed out several policy-based reasons for adoption of open source, in particular, the heightened value proposition from open source (when compared to most proprietary formats) in the following categories:
* Security
* Affordability
* Transparency
* Perpetuity
* Interoperability
* Localization. <ref name="papers.ssrn.com">[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1656616 Casson and Ryan, Open Standards, Open Source Adoption in the Public Sector, and Their Relationship to Microsoft’s Market Dominance]</ref>
Particularly in the context of local governments (who make software decisions), Casson and Ryan argue that "governments have an inherent responsibility and fiduciary duty to taxpayers" which includes the careful analysis of these factors when deciding to purchase proprietary software or implement an open-source option. <ref>Id. </ref> . 

The [[Open Source Definition]], notably, presents an open source philosophy, and further defines the terms of usage, modification and redistribution of open source software. Software licenses grant rights to users which would otherwise be reserved by copyright law to the copyright holder. Several open source software licenses have qualified within the boundaries of the Open Source Definition. The most prominent and popular example is the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL), which “allows free distribution under the condition that further developments and applications are put under the same licence” – thus also free. <ref name="Holtgrewe 2004 129–146">{{cite journal|last=Holtgrewe|first=Ursula|title=Articulating the Speed(s) of the Internet: The Case of Open Source/Free Software.|journal=Time Society|year=2004|volume=13|pages=129–146|doi=10.1177/0961463X04040750}}</ref>  While open source distribution presents a way to make the source code of a product publicly accessible, the open source licenses allow the authors to fine tune such access.  . 

The ''open source'' label came out of a strategy session held on April 7, 1998 in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] in reaction to [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape's]] January 1998 announcement of a source code release for [[Netscape Navigator|Navigator]] (as [[Mozilla]]). A group of individuals at the session included [[Tim O'Reilly]], [[Linus Torvalds]], Tom Paquin, [[Jamie Zawinski]], [[Larry Wall]], [[Brian Behlendorf]], [[Sameer Parekh]], [[Eric Allman]], Greg Olson, [[Paul Vixie]], [[John Ousterhout]], [[Guido van Rossum]], [[Philip Zimmermann]], [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]] and [[Eric S. Raymond]]. <ref>{{cite web | title=Open Source Pioneers Meet in Historic Summit | date=1998-04-14 | url=http://press.oreilly.com/pub/pr/796 | accessdate=2010-08-19 }}</ref> They used the opportunity before the release of Navigator's source code to clarify a potential confusion caused by the ambiguity of the word "free" in [[English language|English]].  . 

Many people claimed that the birth of the [[Internet]], since 1969, started the open source movement, while others do not distinguish between open source and free software movements. <ref>{{cite book | title=Open Source: A Multidisciplinary Approach | first=Moreno | last=Muffatto | publisher=Imperial College Press | year=2006 | isbn=1-86094-665-8 }}</ref> . 

The [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF), started in 1985, intended the word "free" to mean ''freedom to distribute'' (or "free as in free speech") and not ''freedom from cost'' (or "free as in free beer"). Since a great deal of free software already was (and still is) free of charge, such free software became associated with zero cost, which seemed anti-commercial.  . 

The Open Source Initiative (OSI) was formed in February 1998 by Eric S. Raymond and Bruce Perens. With at least 20 years of evidence from case histories of closed software development versus open development already provided by the Internet developer community, the OSI presented the 'open source' case to commercial businesses, like Netscape. The OSI hoped that the usage of the label "open source," a term suggested by Peterson of the [[Foresight Institute]] at the strategy session, would eliminate ambiguity, particularly for individuals who perceive "free software" as anti-commercial. They sought to bring a higher profile to the practical benefits of freely available source code, and they wanted to bring major software businesses and other high-tech industries into open source. Perens attempted to register "open source" as a [[service mark]] for the OSI, but that attempt was impractical by [[trademark]] standards. Meanwhile, due to the presentation of Raymond's paper to the upper management at Netscape—Raymond only discovered when he read the [http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease558.html Press Release], and was called by Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale's PA later in the day—Netscape released its Navigator source code as open source, with favorable results.  . 

==Definitions==. 
The [[Open Source Initiative]]'s definition is widely recognized as the standard or ''[[de facto]]'' definition.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} . 

The Open Source Initiative (OSI) was formed in February 1998 by Raymond and Perens. With about 20 years of evidence from case histories of closed and open development already provided by the Internet, the OSI continued to present the 'open source' case to commercial businesses. They sought to bring a higher profile to the practical benefits of freely available source code, and wanted to bring major software businesses and other high-tech industries into open source. Perens adapted the [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]] to make ''[[The Open Source Definition]]''. <ref>Perens, Bruce. [http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/perens.html Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution]. [[O'Reilly Media]]. 1999. </ref> . 

===The Open Source Definition===. 
The [[Open Source Initiative]] wrote a document called ''The Open Source Definition'' and uses it to determine whether it considers a software license open source. The definition was based on the Debian Free Software Guidelines, written and adapted primarily by Bruce Perens. <ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/perens.html|title=''The Open Source Definition by Bruce Perens''|date= January 1999| isbn =1-56592-582-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://opensource.org/docs/osd|title=''The Open Source Definition''}}, The Open Source Definition according to the Open Source Initiative</ref> Perens did not base his writing on the "four freedoms" of Free Software from the FSF, which were only widely available later. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1129863&cid=26875815 |title=How Many Open Source Licenses Do You Need? - Slashdot |work=News.slashdot.org |date=2009-02-16 |accessdate=2012-03-25}}</ref> . 

===Perens' principles===. 
Under Perens' definition, open source describes a broad general type of software license that makes source code available to the general public with relaxed or non-existent copyright restrictions. The principles, as stated, say absolutely nothing about trademark or [[patent]] use and require absolutely no cooperation to ensure that any common [[audit]] or [[Software release|release]] regime applies to any derived works. It is an explicit "feature" of open source that it may put no restrictions on the use or distribution by any organization or user. It forbids this, in principle, to guarantee continued access to derived works even by the major original contributors.  . 

==Proliferation of the term==. 
{{main|Open source}}
While the term "open source" applied originally only to the source code of software,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html | title = Why "Open Source" misses the point of Free Software | accessdate = December 6, 2007 | last = Stallman | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Stallman | date=  September 24, 2007 | work = Philosophy of the GNU Project | publisher = Free Software Foundation | quote = However, not all of the users and developers of free software agreed with the goals of the free software movement. In 1998, a part of the free software community splintered off and began campaigning in the name of ‘open source.’ The term was originally proposed to avoid a possible misunderstanding of the term ‘free software,’ but it soon became associated with philosophical views quite different from those of the free software movement.}}</ref> it is now being applied to many other areas such as [[Open source ecology]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.openfarmtech.org  | title = ''Open Source Ecology'' | quote = ...building the world's first replicable open source self-sufficient decentralized high-appropriate-tech permaculture ecovillage...}}</ref> a movement to decentralize technologies so that any human can use them. However, it is often misapplied to other areas which have different and competing principles, which overlap only partially. <!-- ''See [[open source (journalism)]] for the only other such definition in widespread use.''--> . 

==Non-software use==. 
The principles of open source have been adapted for many forms of [[user generated content]] and technology, including [[open source hardware]].  . 

Supporters of the open content movement advocate some restrictions of use, requirements to share changes, and [[attribution (copyright)|attribution]] to other authors of the work.  . 

This “culture” or [[ideology]] takes the view that the principles apply more generally to facilitate concurrent input of different agendas, approaches and priorities, in contrast with more centralized models of development such as those typically used in commercial companies. <ref name="autogenerated1">Raymond, Eric S. ''[[The Cathedral and the Bazaar]]''. ed 3.0. 2000. </ref> . 

Advocates of the open source principles often point to [[Wikipedia]] as an example, but Wikipedia has in fact often restricted certain types of use or user, and the [[GFDL]] license it has historically used makes specific requirements of all users, which technically violates the open source principles.  . 

===Business models===. 
{{Main|Business models for open source software}}
There are a number of commonly recognized barriers to the adoption of open source software by enterprises. These barriers include the perception that open source licenses are [[viral license|viral]], lack of formal support and training, the velocity of change, and a lack of a long term roadmap. The majority of these barriers are risk-related. From the other side, not all proprietary projects disclose exact future plans, not all open source licenses are equally viral and many serious OSS projects (especially operating systems) actually make money from paid support and documentation.  . 

A commonly employed [[business strategy]] of commercial open-source software firms is the [[dual-licensing|dual-license]] Strategy, as demonstrated by [[Ingres (database)|Ingres]], [[MySQL]], [[Alfresco (software)|Alfresco]], and others.  . 

==Widely used open source products==. 
Open source software (OSS) projects are built and maintained by a network of volunteer programmers. Prime examples of open source products are the [[Apache HTTP Server]], the e-commerce platform [[osCommerce]] and the internet browser [[Mozilla Firefox]]. One of the most successful open source products is the [[Linux|GNU/Linux]] operating system, an open source [[Unix-like]] operating system, and its derivative [[Android (operating system)|Android]], an operating system for mobile devices. <ref>Michael J. Gallivan, “Striking a Balance Between Trust and Control in a Virtual Organization: A Content Analysis of Open Source Software Case Studies”, Info Systems Journal 11 (2001): 277–304</ref><ref>Hal Plotkin, “What (and Why) you should know about open-source software” Harvard Management Update 12 (1998): 8-9</ref> In some fields, open software is the norm, like in [[voice over IP]] applications with [[Asterisk (PBX)]]. Open source standards are not, however, limited to open-source software.  For example, Microsoft has also joined the open-source discussion with the adoption of their [[OpenDocument]] format<ref name="papers.ssrn.com"/> as well as creating another open standard, the Office Open XML formats.  . 

==Development philosophy==.

| url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html
}}</ref> [[open source evangelist]] Eric S. Raymond suggests a model for developing OSS known as the ''bazaar'' model. Raymond likens the development of software by traditional methodologies to building a cathedral, "carefully crafted by individual wizards or small bands of mages working in splendid isolation". <ref name="ray2000"/> He suggests that all software should be developed using the bazaar style, which he described as "a great babbling bazaar of differing agendas and approaches." . 

In the traditional model of development, which he called the ''cathedral'' model, development takes place in a centralized way. Roles are clearly defined. Roles include people dedicated to designing (the architects), people responsible for managing the project, and people responsible for implementation. Traditional software engineering follows the cathedral model. [[Fred Brooks|Fred P. Brooks]] in his book ''[[The Mythical Man-Month]]'' advocates this model. He goes further to say that in order to preserve the architectural integrity of a system, the system design should be done by as few architects as possible.  . 

The bazaar model, however, is different. In this model, roles are not clearly defined. Gregorio Robles<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> suggests that software developed using the bazaar model should exhibit the following patterns: . 

; Users should be treated as co-developers: The users are treated like co-developers and so they should have access to the source code of the software. Furthermore users are encouraged to submit additions to the software, code fixes for the software, bug reports, documentation etc. Having more co-developers increases the rate at which the software evolves. [[Linus's law]] states, "Given enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow." This means that if many users view the source code, they will eventually find all bugs and suggest how to fix them. Note that some users have advanced programming skills, and furthermore, each user's machine provides an additional testing environment. This new testing environment offers that ability to find and fix a new bug. 
; Early releases: The first version of the software should be released as early as possible so as to increase one's chances of finding co-developers early. 
; Frequent integration: Code changes should be integrated (merged into a shared code base) as often as possible so as to avoid the overhead of fixing a large number of bugs at the end of the project life cycle. Some open source projects have nightly builds where [[continuous integration|integration is done automatically]] on a daily basis. 
; Several versions: There should be at least two versions of the software. There should be a buggier version with more features and a more stable version with fewer features. The buggy version (also called the development version) is for users who want the immediate use of the latest features, and are willing to accept the risk of using code that is not yet thoroughly tested. The users can then act as co-developers, reporting bugs and providing bug fixes. 
; High modularization: The general structure of the software should be modular allowing for parallel development on independent components. 
; Dynamic decision making structure: There is a need for a decision making structure, whether formal or informal, that makes strategic decisions depending on changing user requirements and other factors. Cf. [[Extreme programming]].  . 

Data suggests, however, that OSS is not quite as democratic as the bazaar model suggests. An analysis of five billion bytes of free/open source code by 31,999 developers shows that 74% of the code was written by the most active 10% of authors. The average number of authors involved in a project was 5.1, with the median at 2. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Ghosh|first=R.A.|coauthors=Robles, G. and Glott, R.|title=Free/Libre and Open Source Software: Survey and Study Part V.|journal=Maastricht: International Institute of Infonomics.|year=2002}}</ref> . 

==Licensing==. 
{{Refimprove|section|date=March 2012}}
{{Main|Open-source license}} . 

A license defines the rights and obligations that a licensor grants to a licensee. Open Source licenses grant licensees the right to copy, modify and redistribute source code (or content). These licenses may also impose obligations (e.g., modifications to the code that are distributed must be made available in source code form, an author attribution must be placed in a program/ documentation using that Open Source, etc.).  . 

Authors initially derive a right to grant a license to their work based on the legal theory that upon creation of a work the author owns the copyright in that work. What the author/licensor is granting when they grant a license to copy, modify and redistribute their work is the right to use the author’s copyrights. The author still retains ownership of those copyrights, the licensee simply is allowed to use those rights, as granted in the license, so long as they maintain the obligations of the license. The author does have the option to sell/assign, versus license, their exclusive right to the copyrights to their work; whereupon the new owner/assignee controls the copyrights.  The ownership of the copyright (the “rights”) is separate and distinct from the ownership of the work (the “thing”) - a person can own a copy of a  piece of code (or a copy of a book) without the rights to copy, modify or redistribute copies of it.  . 

When an author contributes code to an Open Source project (e.g., Apache.org) they do so under an explicit license (e.g., the Apache Contributor License Agreement) or an implicit license (e.g., the Open Source license under which the project is already licensing code).  Some Open Source projects do not take contributed code under a license, but actually require (joint) assignment of the author’s copyright in order to accept code contributions into the project (e.g., OpenOffice.org and its Joint Copyright Assignment agreement).  . 

Placing code (or content) in the public domain is a way of waiving an author’s (or owner’s) copyrights in that work.  No license is granted, and none is needed, to copy, modify or redistribute a work in the public domain.  . 

Examples of [[free software license]] / open source licenses include [[Apache License]], [[BSD license]], GNU General Public License, [[GNU Lesser General Public License]], [[MIT License]], [[Eclipse Public License]] and [[Mozilla Public License]].  . 

The proliferation of open source licenses is one of the few negative aspects of the open source movement because it is often difficult to understand the legal implications of the differences between licenses.With more than 180,000 open source projects available and its more than 1400 unique licenses, the complexity of deciding how to manage open source usage within “closed-source”
commercial enterprises have dramatically increased. Some are home-grown while others are modeled after mainstream FOSS licenses such as Berkeley Software Distribution (“BSD”), Apache, MIT-style (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), or GNU General Public License (“GPL”).   In view of this, open source practitioners are starting to use classification schemes in which FOSS licenses are grouped (typically based on the existence and obligations imposed by the copyleft provision; the strength of the copyleft provision). <ref>Andrew T. Pham, Verint Systems Inc. and Matthew B. Weinstein and Jamie L. Ryerson. “[http://www.ipo.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Patents&Template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=26682 Easy as ABC: Categorizing Open Source Licenses]”; www.IPO.org. June 2010. </ref> . 

An important legal milestone for the open source / free software movement was passed in 2008, when the US federal appeals court ruled that [[free software licences]] definitely do set legally binding conditions on the use of copyrighted work, and they are therefore enforceable under existing copyright law. As a result, if end-users do violate the licensing conditions, their license disappears, meaning they are infringing copyright. <ref>{{cite news

==Funding==. 
{{See also|Commercial open source applications}} . 

Unlike proprietary off-the-shelf software, which comes with restrictive copyright licenses, open-source software can be given away for no charge. This means that its creators cannot require each user to pay a license fee to fund development. Instead, a number of alternative models for funding its development have emerged.  . 

Software can be developed as a consulting project for one or more customers. The customers pay to direct the developers' efforts: to have bugs prioritized and fixed or features added. Companies or independent consultants can also charge for training, installation, [[technical support]], or customization of the software.  . 

Another approach to funding is to provide the software freely, but sell licenses to proprietary add-ons such as data libraries. For instance, an open-source [[computer aided design|CAD]] program may require parts libraries which are sold on a subscription or flat-fee basis. Open-source software can also promote the sale of specialized hardware that it interoperates with, as in the case of the Asterisk telephony software, developed by a manufacturer of PC telephony hardware.  . 

Many open-source software projects have begun as research projects within universities, as personal projects of students or professors, or as tools to aid scientific research. The influence of universities and research institutions on open source shows in the number of projects named after their host institutions, such as [[BSD Unix]], [[CMU Common Lisp]], or the [[NCSA HTTPd]] which evolved into [[Apache Web server|Apache]].  . 

Companies may employ developers to work on open-source projects that are useful to the company's infrastructure: in this case, it is developed not as a product to be sold but as a sort of shared public utility. A local bug-fix or solution to a software problem, written by a developer either at a company’s request or to make his/her own job easier, can be released as an open source contribution without costing the company anything. <ref name="Holtgrewe 2004 129–146"/> A larger project such as the Linux kernel may have contributors from dozens of companies which use and depend upon it, as well as hobbyist and research developers.  . 

==Comparison with closed source==. 
{{Main|Comparison of open source and closed source}} . 

The debate over ''open source'' vs. ''[[closed source]]'' (alternatively called [[proprietary software]]) is sometimes heated.  . 

The top four reasons (as provided by Open Source Business Conference survey<ref name="cmswire1">{{cite web|author=Irina Guseva (@irina_guseva) |url=http://www.cmswire.com/cms/web-cms/bad-economy-is-good-for-open-source-004187.php |title=Bad Economy Is Good for Open Source |work=Cmswire.com |date=2009-03-26 |accessdate=2012-03-25}}</ref>) individuals or organizations choose open-source software are: 1) lower cost, 2) security, 3) no vendor 'lock in', and 4) better quality.  . 

Since innovative companies no longer rely heavily on software sales, proprietary software has become less of a necessity. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/243136/open_source_vs_proprietary_software.html |title=Open Source vs. Proprietary Software &#124; PCWorld Business Center |work=Pcworld.com |date=2011-11-03 |accessdate=2012-03-25}}</ref>  As such, things like open-source [[content management system]] -- or CMS -- deployments are becoming more commonplace.  In 2009,<ref>{{cite web|author=Geoff Spick (@Goffee71) |url=http://www.cmswire.com/cms/web-cms/open-source-movement-finds-friends-at-the-white-house-005867.php |title=Open Source Movement Finds Friends at the White House |work=Cmswire.com |date=2009-10-26 |accessdate=2012-03-25}}</ref> the US White House switched its CMS system from a proprietary system to [[Drupal]] open-source CMS.  Further, companies like [[Novell]] (who traditionally sold software the old-fashioned way) continually debate the benefits of switching to open-source availability, having already switched part of the product offering to open-source code. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Pandoras-box-for-open-source/2009-7344_3-5157470.html |title=Pandora's box for open source - CNET News |work=News.cnet.com |date=2004-02-12 |accessdate=2012-03-25}}</ref>  In this way, open-source software provides solutions to unique or specific problems.  As such, it is reported <ref>{{cite web|last=Murphy |first=David |url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2367829,00.asp |title=Survey: 98 Percent of Companies Use Open-Source, 29 Percent Contribute Back &#124; News & Opinion |work=PCMag.com |date=2010-08-15 |accessdate=2012-03-25}}</ref> that 98% of enterprise-level companies use open-source offerings in some capacity.  . 

With this market shift, more critical systems are beginning to rely on open-source offerings,<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Homeland-Security-helps-secure-open-source-code/2100-1002_3-6025579.html |title=Homeland Security helps secure open-source code - CNET News |work=News.cnet.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-25}}</ref>  allowing greater funding (such as [[US Department of Homeland Security]] grants <ref name="autogenerated2"/>) to help "hunt for security bugs." . 

This is not to argue that open-source software does not have its flaws.  One of the greatest barriers facing wide acceptance of open-source software relates to the lack of technical and general support. <ref name="cmswire1"/>  Open-source companies often combat this by offering support sometimes under a different product name.  [[Acquia]] provides enterprise-level support for its open-source alternative, Drupal, for instance. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acquia.com |title=Drupal - Content Management, Social Business, Cloud, Support |publisher=Acquia |date= |accessdate=2012-03-25}}</ref> . 

Many open-source advocates argue that open-source software is inherently safer because any person can view, edit, and change code. <ref>{{cite web|last=Seltzer |first=Larry |url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1566726,00.asp |title=Is Open-Source Really Safer? |work=PCMag.com |date=2004-05-04 |accessdate=2012-03-25}}</ref>  But closed-source software -- and some research<ref>{{cite web|author=Kevin Poulsen |url=http://www.securityfocus.com/news/7947 |title=DARPA-funded Linux security hub withers |work=Securityfocus.com |date=2004-01-30 |accessdate=2012-03-25}}</ref> -- suggests that individuals that aren't paid to scrub code have no incentive to do the boring, monotonous work.  . 

Research indicates <ref>As a case in point, the study [http://www.wired.com/software/coolapps/news/2004/12/66022 Linux: Fewer Bugs Than Rivals] reports that linux source code has 0.17 bugs per 1000 lines of code while non-Open-Source commercial software generally scores 20-30 bugs per 1000 lines</ref> that the open-source software - Linux - has a lower percentage of bugs than some commercial software.  . 

==Comparison with free software==. 
{{Main|Alternative terms for free software}} . 

The main difference is that by choosing one term over the other (i.e. either "open source" or "free software") one lets others know about what one's goals are. As [[Richard Stallman]] puts it, "Open source is a development methodology; free software is a social movement."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html |title=Why "Free Software" is better than "Open Source" }}</ref> . 

Critics have said that the term “open source” fosters an ambiguity of a different kind such that it confuses the mere availability of the source with the freedom to use, modify, and redistribute it. Developers have used the [[alternative terms for free software|alternative terms]] ''Free/open source Software'' ([[FOSS]]), or ''Free/Libre/open source Software'' (FLOSS), consequently, to describe open source software which is also free software.  . 

The term “open source” was originally intended to be trademarkable; however, the term was deemed too descriptive, so no trademark exists. <ref>{{cite web

Open source software and free software are different terms for software which comes with certain rights, or freedoms, for the user. They describe two approaches and [[philosophy|philosophies]] towards free software. ''Open source'' and ''free software'' (or ''software libre'') both describe software which is free from onerous licensing restrictions. It may be used, copied, studied, modified and redistributed without restriction. Free software is not the same as [[freeware]], software available at zero price.  . 

The definition of open source software was written to be almost identical to the [[free software definition]]. <ref name="Stallman20070616">{{cite web

}}</ref> There are very few cases of software that is free software but is not open source software, and vice versa. The difference in the terms is where they place the emphasis. “Free software” is defined in terms of giving the user freedom. This reflects the goal of the free software movement. “Open source” highlights that the source code is viewable to all; proponents of the term usually emphasize the quality of the software and how this is caused by the development models which are possible and popular among [[free and open source software]] projects.  . 

Free software licenses are not written exclusively by the FSF. The FSF and the OSI both list licenses which meet their respective definitions of free software or open source software.  .

==Open source vs. source-available== . 

Although the OSI definition of "open source software" is widely accepted, a small number of people and organizations use the term to refer to software where the source is available for viewing, but which may not legally be modified or redistributed. Such software is more often referred to as ''source-available'', or as ''[[shared source]]'', a term coined by Microsoft.  .

Because OSI does not have a registered trademark for the term "open source", its legal ability to prevent such usage of the term is limited, but Tiemann advocates using public opinion from OSI, customers, and community members to pressure such organizations to change their license or to use a different term.  . 

==Pros and cons for software producers==. 
Software experts and researchers on open source software have identified several advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage for business is that open source is a good way for business to achieve greater penetration of the market. Companies that offer open source software are able to establish an industry standard and, thus, gain competitive advantage{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}. It has also helped build developer loyalty as developers feel empowered and have a sense of ownership of the end product. <ref name="Sharma2002">{{cite journal

Besides, it offers the potential for a more flexible technology and quicker innovation. It is said to be more reliable since it typically has thousands of independent programmers testing and fixing bugs of the software. It is flexible because modular systems allow programmers to build custom interfaces, or add new abilities to it and it is innovative since open source programs are the product of collaboration among a large number of different programmers. The mix of divergent perspectives, corporate objectives, and personal goals speeds up innovation. <ref>{{cite journal

It is sometimes said that the open source development process may not be well defined and the stages in the development process, such as system testing and documentation may be ignored. However this is only true for small (mostly single programmer) projects.

==Development tools==. 
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}
In OSS development, the participants, who are mostly volunteers, are distributed among different geographic regions, so there is need for tools to aid participants to collaborate in source code development. Often, these tools are also available as OSS.  . 

[[Revision control]] systems such as [[Concurrent Versions System]] (CVS) and later [[Subversion (software)|Subversion]] (svn) and [[Git (software)|Git]] are examples of tools that help centrally manage the source code files and the changes to those files for a software project.  . 

Utilities that automate testing, compiling, and bug reporting help preserve stability and support of software projects that have numerous developers but no managers, quality controller, or technical support. Building systems that report compilation errors among different platforms include [[Tinderbox (software)|Tinderbox]]. Commonly used [[bugtracker]]s include [[Bugzilla]] and [[GNATS]].  . 

Tools such as [[mailing lists]], [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], and [[instant messaging]] provide means of Internet communication between developers. The Web is also a core feature of all of the above systems. Some sites centralize all the features of these tools as a [[software development management system]], including [[GNU Savannah]], [[SourceForge]], and [[BountySource]].  . 

==Projects and organizations==. 
One of the benefits of open source software is that there are a wide variety of codes in oss projects for program developers. Without any blocking of this wide and diverse platform, developers create a wide range of projects and organizations. Some of the "more prominent organizations" involved in OSS development include the [[Apache Software Foundation]], creators of the Apache web server; a loose affiliation of developers headed by Linus Torvalds, creators of the [[Linux kernel|Linux]] operating system kernel; the [[Eclipse Foundation]], home of the [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] software development platform; the Debian Project, creators of the influential Debian GNU/Linux distribution;
the [[Mozilla Foundation]], home of the Firefox web browser; and [[OW2]], European-born community developing open-source middleware. New organizations tend to have a more sophisticated governance model and their membership is often formed by legal entity members. <ref>[[François Letellier]] (2008), [http://flet.netcipia.net/xwiki/bin/download/Main/publications%2Dfr/GEM2008%2DFLetellier%2DSubmittedPaper.pdf Open Source Software: the Role of Nonprofits in Federating Business and Innovation Ecosystems], AFME 2008. </ref> . 

Several Open Source programs have become defining entries in their space, including the [[GIMP]] image editing system; [[Sun Microsystems|Sun's]] [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programming language and environment; the MySQL database system; the [[FreeBSD]] Unix operating system; [[Sun Microsystems|Sun's]] [[OpenOffice.org]] office productivity suite; and the [[Wireshark]] network [[packet sniffer]] and protocol analyser.  . 

Open Source development is often performed "live and in public", using services provided for free on the Internet, such as the [[Launchpad (website)|Launchpad]] and [[SourceForge.net|SourceForge]] web sites, and using tools that are themselves Open Source, including the CVS and Subversion source control systems, and the [[GNU Compiler Collection]].  . 

[[Open Source for America]] is a group created to raise awareness in the U.S. Federal Government about the benefits of open source software. Their stated goals are to encourage the government’s utilization of open source software, participation in open source software projects, and incorporation of open source community dynamics to increase government transparency. <ref>{{cite web|last=Hellekson |first=Gunnar |url=http://opensourceforamerica.org/ |title=Home |publisher=Open Source for America |date= |accessdate=2012-03-25}}</ref> . 

[[Mil-OSS]] is a group dedicated to the advancement of OSS use and creation in the military. <ref>{{cite web|author=from EntandoSrl (Entando ) |url=http://mil-oss.org/ |title=Mil-OSS |work=Mil-OSS |date= |accessdate=2012-03-25}}</ref> . 

==Certification== . 

Certification can help to build higher user confidence. Certification could be applied to the simplest component that can be used by developers to build the simplest module to a whole software system. There have been numerous institutions involving in this area of the open source software including The International Institute of Software Technology / United Nations University <http://www.iist.unu.edu>. UNU/IIST is a [[non-profit]] research and education institution of The United Nations. It is currently involved in a project known as "The Global Desktop Project". This project aims to build a desktop interface that every end-user is able to understand and interact with, thus crossing the language and cultural barriers. It is drawing huge attention from parties involved in areas ranging from application development to localization. Furthermore, this project will improve developing nations' access to information systems. UNU/IIST aims to achieve this without any compromise in the quality of the software. It believes a global standard can be maintained by introducing certifications and is currently organizing conferences in order to explore frontiers in the field <http://opencert.iist.unu.edu>.  . 

Alternatively, assurance models (such as [[DO178B]]) have already solved the "certification" approach for software.  This approach is tailorable and can be applied to OSS, but only if the requisite planning and execution, design, test and traceability artifacts are generated.  . 

==Criticism==. 
{{see also|Free software#Criticism}}
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2007}} . 

The criticisms of the specific [[Open Source Initiative]] (OSI) principles are dealt with above as part of the definition and differentiation from other terms. The open content movement does not recognize nor endorse the OSI principles and embraces instead mutual [[Share-Alike]] agreements that require commercial use or the preparation of [[derivative work]]s.  . 

Of the vocal critics, Richard Stallman of the FSF, flatly opposes the term “Open Source” being applied to what they refer to as “free software”. Although it is clear that legally free software does qualify as open source, Stallman considers that the category is abusive. <ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html |title = Why "Open Source" misses the point of Free Software |accessdate = July 23, 2007 |last = Stallman |first = Richard |authorlink = Richard Stallman |date=  June 16, 2007 |work = Philosophy of the GNU Project |publisher = Free Software Foundation |quote = As the advocates of open source draw new users into our community, we free software activists have to work even more to bring the issue of freedom to those new users' attention. We have to say, ‘It's free software and it gives you freedom!’—more and louder than ever. Every time you say ‘free software’ rather than ‘open source,’ you help our campaign. }}</ref> Critics also oppose the professed pragmatism of the [[Open Source Initiative]], as they fear that the free software ideals of freedom and community are threatened by compromising on the FSF's idealistic standards for software freedom. <ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html |title = Why "Free Software" is better than "Open Source" |accessdate = July 23, 2007 |last = Stallman |first = Richard |authorlink = Richard Stallman |date=  June 19, 2007 |work = Philosophy of the GNU Project |publisher = Free Software Foundation |quote = Sooner or later these users will be invited to switch back to proprietary software for some practical advantage. Countless companies seek to offer such temptation, and why would users decline? Only if they have learned to value the freedom free software gives them, for its own sake.

A certain amount of the ‘keep quiet’ approach to business can be useful for the community, but we must have plenty of freedom talk too. }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html |title = Why "Open Source" misses the point of Free Software |accessdate = July 23, 2007 |last = Stallman |first = Richard |authorlink = Richard Stallman |date=  June 16, 2007 |work = Philosophy of the GNU Project |publisher = Free Software Foundation |quote = Under the pressure of the movie and record companies, software for individuals to use is increasingly designed specifically to restrict them. This malicious feature is known as DRM, or Digital Restrictions Management (see [http://defectivebydesign.org/ DefectiveByDesign.org]), and it is the antithesis in spirit of the freedom that free software aims to provide. […] Yet some open source supporters have proposed ‘open source DRM’ software. Their idea is that by publishing the source code of programs designed to restrict your access to encrypted media, and allowing others to change it, they will produce more powerful and reliable software for restricting users like you. Then it will be delivered to you in devices that do not allow you to change it. This software might be ‘open source,’ and use the open source development model; but it won't be free software, since it won't respect the freedom of the users that actually run it. If the open source development model succeeds in making this software more powerful and reliable for restricting you, that will make it even worse.}}</ref> . 

Increasingly{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}, the consensus term "[[free and open-source software]]" is used by the communities at large to describe the common ground between free software and open-source software.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} .
