{{wiktionary|proprietary}}
'''Proprietary software''' is computer software [[software license|licensed]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} under exclusive legal right of the copyright holder.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  The [[licensee]] is given the right to use the software under certain conditions, while restricted from other uses, such as modification, further distribution, or [[reverse engineering]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} . 

Complementary terms include [[free software]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} licensed by the owner under more permissive terms, and [[public domain software]], which is not subject to copyright and can be used for any purpose. Proponents of [[free and open source software]] use ''proprietary'' or ''non-free'' to describe software that is not free or open source. <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html#ProprietarySoftware | title=Categories of Free and Nonfree Software - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF) | quote=Proprietary software is another name for nonfree software. | accessdate=2011-10-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/article2886514.ece?homepage=true|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|title=Free software and basic freedom|author=Vasudha Venugopal}} quoting Richard M. Stallman. </ref> . 

In the [[software industry]], [[commercial software]] refers to software produced for sale, which is a related but distinct categorization.  . 

According to [[Eric S. Raymond ]], in the [[Jargon File]], "In the language of hackers and users" it is used pejoratively, with the meaning of "inferior" and "a product not conforming to open-systems standards". <ref>http://catb.org/jargon/html/P/proprietary.html</ref> . 

== Software becoming proprietary ==.

== Legal basis == . 

{{see|Software law|Software copyright|Software patent|End-user license agreement}} . 

Most software is covered by [[software copyright|copyright]] which, along with [[contract|contract law]], [[software patent|patents]], and [[trade secret]]s, provides legal basis for its owner to establish exclusive rights. <ref name="liberman">{{cite journal

A software vendor delineates the specific terms of use in an [[end-user license agreement]] (EULA). The user may agree to this contract in writing, interactively, called [[clickwrap|clickwrap licensing]], or by opening the box containing the software, called [[shrink wrap license|shrink wrap licensing]]. License agreements are usually [[standard form contract|not negotiable]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} . 

[[Software patent]]s grant exclusive rights to algorithms, software features, or other [[patentable subject matter]]. Laws on software patents vary by jurisdiction and are a matter of [[software patent debate|ongoing debate]]. Vendors sometimes grant patent rights to the user in the license agreement. <ref name="tysver">{{cite web

=== Limitations === . 

License agreements do not override applicable [[copyright|copyright law]] or [[contract|contract law]]. Provisions that conflict may not be enforceable.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} . 

Some vendors say that software licensing is not a sale, and that limitations of copyright like the [[first-sale doctrine]] do not apply. The EULA for [[Microsoft Windows]] states that the software is licensed, not sold. <ref>{{cite web

== Exclusive rights == . 

The owner of proprietary software exercises certain [[exclusive right]]s over the software. The owner can restrict use, inspection of source code, modification of source code, and redistribution. <!-- This sentence merely summarizes the following section, and says absolutely nothing controversial. --> . 

=== Use of the software === . 

{{See|Copy protection|Damaged good|Price discrimination}} . 

Vendors typically limit the number of computers on which software can be used, and prohibit the user from installing the software on extra computers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Restricted use is sometimes enforced through a technical measure, such as [[product activation]], a [[product key]] or serial number, a [[dongle|hardware key]], or [[copy protection]].  . 

Vendors may also distribute versions that remove particular features, or versions which allow only certain fields of endeavor, such as non-commercial, educational, or non-profit use.  . 

Use restrictions vary by license:
* [[Windows Vista Starter]] is restricted to running a maximum of three concurrent applications. 
* The retail edition of [[Microsoft Office 2007#Editions|Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007]] is limited to non-commercial use on up three devices in one household. 
* [[Windows XP]] can be installed on one computer, and limits the number of network file sharing connections to 10. <ref>{{cite web

=== Inspection and modification of source code === . 

{{See also2|[[Closed source software]]|[[Open source]]|[[Damaged good#Anti-features|Anti-features]]}} . 

Vendors typically distribute proprietary software in [[compiler|compiled]] form, usually the [[machine code|machine language]] understood by the computer's [[central processing unit]].

Richard Stallman says that proprietary software commonly contains "malicious features, such as spying on the users, restricting the users, back doors, and imposed upgrades."<ref>https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html</ref> Some proprietary software vendors say that retaining the source code makes their software more secure, because the widely available code for open-source software makes it easier to identify [[vulnerability (computing)|security vulnerabilities]]. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4602325.stm | work=BBC News | first=Steve | last=Kingstone | title=Brazil adopts open-source software | date=2005-06-02}}</ref> Open source proponents pejoratively call this [[security through obscurity]], and say that wide availability results in increased scrutiny of the source code, making open source software more secure. <ref>http://www.technewsworld.com/story/57085.html?wlc=1276053152</ref> . 

While most proprietary software is closed-source, some vendors distribute the source code or otherwise make it available to customers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} The source code is covered by a [[non-disclosure agreement]] or a license that allows, for example, study and modification, but not redistribution.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} The text-based email client [[Pine (e-mail client)|Pine]] and certain implementations of [[Secure Shell]] are distributed with proprietary licenses that make the source code available.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} . 

Some governments fear that proprietary software may include [[software bug|defects]] or [[malware|malicious features]] which would compromise sensitive information. In 2003 Microsoft established a Government Security Program (GSP) to allow governments to view source code and Microsoft security documentation, of which the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] was an early participant. <ref>http://news.cnet.com/Governments-to-see-Windows-code/2100-1006_3-980666.html</ref><ref name="china">http://news.cnet.com/2100-1007-990526.html</ref> The program is part of Microsoft's broader [[shared source|Shared Source Initiative]] which provides source code access for some products. The Reference Source License (Ms-RSL) and Limited Public License (Ms-LPL) are proprietary software licenses where the source code is made available.  . 

Software vendors sometimes use [[obfuscated code]] to impede users who would [[reverse engineer]] the software.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} This is particularly common with certain [[programming language]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} For example, the [[Java bytecode|bytecode]] for programs written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] can be easily [[decompiler|decompiled]] to somewhat usable code,{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} and the source code for programs written in [[scripting language]]s such as [[PHP]] or [[JavaScript]] is available at [[run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]]. <ref>{{cite web

  | quote = While the Web promotes the sharing of such code, there are times when you or a client may not want to share their JavaScript code. This may be due to the sensitive nature of data within the code, proprietary calculations, or any other scenario.}}</ref> . 

=== Redistribution === . 

{{see|Shareware}}
{{See also|Freely redistributable software}} . 

Proprietary software vendors can prohibit users from sharing the software with others. Another unique license is required for another party to use the software.  . 

In the case of proprietary software with source code available, the vendor may also prohibit customers from distributing their modifications to the source code.  . 

<!-- Keep consistent with definition at [[shareware]]. -->
[[Shareware]] is closed-source software whose owner encourages redistribution at no cost, but which the user sometimes must pay to use after a trial period. The fee usually allows use by a single user or computer. In some cases, software features are restricted during or after the trial period, a practice sometimes called [[damaged good|crippleware]].  . 

== Interoperability with software and hardware ==. 
{{Further2|[[Interoperability#Software|Interoperability of software]]}} . 

=== Proprietary file formats and protocols === . 

{{see|Proprietary format|Proprietary protocol}} . 

Proprietary software often{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} stores some of its data in file formats which are incompatible with other software, and may also communicate using [[communication protocol|protocols]] which are incompatible. Such formats and protocols may be restricted as [[trade secret]]s or subject to [[patent]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} . 

=== Proprietary APIs === . 

A proprietary [[application programming interface]] (API) is a [[software library]] interface "specific to one device or, more likely to a number of devices within a particular manufacturer's product range."<ref name="techworld">http://features.techworld.com/applications/471/apis-what-they-are-and-what-theyre-for/</ref>  The motivation for using a proprietary API can be [[vendor lock-in]] or because standard APIs do not support the device's functionality. <ref name="techworld"/> .

=== Vendor lock-in ===. 
{{see|Vendor lock-in}} . 

A dependency on the future versions and upgrades for a proprietary software package can create ''vendor lock-in'', entrenching a monopoly position. <ref>{{cite web

Free standards are those that can be used by anyone and are not controlled by a single company. In the case of computers, this can usually be accomplished by using free software rather than proprietary software (i.e., commercial software).}}</ref> . 

=== Software limited to certain hardware configurations ===. 
Proprietary software may also have licensing terms that limit the usage of that software to a specific set of hardware. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] has such a licensing model for [[Mac OS X]], an operating system which is limited to Apple hardware, both by licensing and various design decisions. This licensing model has been affirmed by the [[United States Court of Appeals]]. <ref>{{cite web

== Abandonment by owners == . 

{{main|Abandonware}} . 

Proprietary software which is no longer marketed by its owner and is used without permission by users is called [[abandonware]] and may include source code.  Some abandonware has the source code released to the public domain either by its author or copyright holder and is therefore free software, and no longer proprietary software. <!-- Keep consistent with definition at [[abandonware]]. --> . 

If the proprietor of a software package should cease to exist, or decide to cease or limit production or support for a proprietary software package, recipients and users of the package may have no recourse if problems are found with the software.  Proprietors can fail to improve and support software because of business problems. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/32277|title=What happens when a proprietary software company dies?|month=October|year=2003|publisher=NewsForge|accessdate=2007-03-05}}</ref>  When no other vendor can provide support for the software, the ending of support for older or existing versions of a software package may be done to force users to upgrade and pay for newer versions; or migrate to either competing systems with longer support life cycles or to [[Free and open source software|FOSS]]-based systems. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=GL4O5EZFOXYJGQSNDLPSKH0CJUNN2JVN?articleID=196700071|title=Microsoft Turns Up The Heat On Windows 2000 Users|month=December|year=2006|publisher=InformationWeek|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref> .

*{{Anchor|semi-free}}''Semi-free software'' was used by the [[Free Software Foundation]] to describe software that is not [[free software]], but comes with permission for individuals to use, copy, distribute, and modify either for non-profit purposes only or with the prohibition to redistribute modified copies or derived works. <ref>[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html#semi-freeSoftware Semi-free software], definition by the Free Software Foundation</ref>  Such software is also rejected by the [[Open Source Initiative]] and [[Debian]].  [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] is an example of a semi-free program.  The Free Software Foundation classifies semi-free software as non-free software and no longer draws a distinction between semi-free software and proprietary software.  . 

== Examples ==. 
Well known examples of proprietary software include [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Adobe Flash Player]], [[PlayStation 3|PS3]] OS, [[iTunes]], [[Adobe Photoshop]], [[Google Earth]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Skype]], [[WinRAR]], and some versions of [[Unix]].  . 

Software distributions considered as proprietary may in fact incorporate a "mixed source" model including both free and non-free software in the same distribution. <ref>{{cite journal

Some free software packages are also simultaneously available under proprietary terms.  Examples include [[MySQL]], [[Sendmail]] and ssh.  The original copyright holders for a work of free software, even copyleft free software, can use [[dual-licensing]] to allow themselves or others to redistribute proprietary versions.   Non-copyleft free software (i.e. software distributed under a permissive free software license or released to the public domain) allows anyone to make proprietary redistributions. <ref name="rosenberg2000p109">{{cite book
