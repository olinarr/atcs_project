[[Free software|Free]]/[[open source software]] - the [[free software license|source availability model]] used by [[free and open source software]] (FOSS) - and [[closed source]] are two approaches to the distribution of [[software]].  . 

== Background == . 

Under the ''closed source'' model source code is not released to the public. Closed source software is maintained by a team who produces their product in a [[compiler|compiled]] executable state, which is what the market is allowed access to. [[Microsoft]], the owner and developer of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Microsoft Office]], along with other major software companies, have long been proponents of this business model. Although in August 2010, Microsoft interoperability general manager Jean Paoli said Microsoft "loves open source" and its anti-open source position was a mistake. <ref name="Microsoft Open Source Statement">[http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/203923/microsoft_we_love_open_source.html Microsoft: 'We Love Open Source']</ref> . 

The [[FOSS]] model allows for able users to view and modify a product's source code. Common advantages cited by proponents for having such a structure are expressed in terms of trust, acceptance, teamwork and quality. <ref>[http://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html The GNU Manifesto - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . 

A non-free license is used to limit what [[free software movement]] advocates consider to be the essential freedoms. A license, whether providing [[open source]] code or not, that does not stipulate the "four software freedoms",<ref>[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html The Free Software Definition - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> are not considered "free" by the free software movement. A closed source license is one that limits only the availability of the source code. By contrast a [[copyleft]] license claims to protect the "four software freedoms" by explicitly granting them and then explicitly prohibiting anyone to redistribute the package or reuse the code in it to make derivative works without including the same licensing clauses. Some licenses grant the four software freedoms but allow redistributors to remove them if they wish. Such licenses are sometimes called ''permissive software licenses''. <ref>[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html Various Licenses and Comments about Them - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> An example of such a license is the [[FreeBSD License]] which allows derivative software to be distributed as non-free or closed source, as long as they give credit to the original designers.  . 

FOSS can and has been commercialized by companies such as [[Red Hat]], [[IBM]], [[Novell]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Mozilla Foundation]], [[VMware]] and others.  . 

== Commercialization ==. 
=== Closed-source Software===. 
{{Main|Closed-source Software|proprietary software}}
The primary business model for closed-source software involves the use of constraints on what can be done with the software and the restriction of access to the original source code. This can result in a form of imposed [[artificial scarcity]] on a product that is otherwise very easy to copy and redistribute.  The end result is that an end-user is not actually purchasing software, but purchasing the right to use the software.  To this end, the source code to closed-source software is considered a trade secret by its manufacturers.  . 

=== FOSS ===. 
{{Main|Business models for open source software}}
FOSS methods, on the other hand, typically do not limit the use of software in this fashion. Instead, the revenue model is based mainly on support services. [[Red Hat Inc.]] and [[Canonical Ltd.]] are such companies that give its software away freely, but charge for support services.  The [[source code]] of the software is usually given away, and pre-compiled binary software frequently accompanies it for convenience.  As a result, the source code can be freely modified.  However, there can be some license-based restrictions on re-distributing the software. Generally, software can be modified and re-distributed for free, as long as credit is given to the original manufacturer of the software. In addition, FOSS can generally be sold commercially, as long as the source-code is provided. There are a wide variety of [[free software license]]s that define how a program can be used, modified, and sold commercially (see [[GNU General Public License|GPL]], [[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]], and [[BSD licenses|BSD-type licenses]]). FOSS may also be funded through donations.  . 

=== Handling competition ===. 
This model has proved somewhat successful, as witnessed in the [[Linux]] community.  There are numerous GNU/[[Linux distribution]]s available, but a great many of them are simply modified versions of some previous version.  For example, [[Fedora Linux]], [[Mandriva Linux]], and [[PCLinuxOS]] are all derivatives of an earlier product, [[Red Hat Linux]].  In fact, [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] is itself a derivative of Fedora Linux.  This is an example of one vendor creating a product, allowing a third-party to modify the software, and then creating a tertiary product based on the modified version.  All of the products listed above are currently produced by software service companies.  . 

Operating systems built on the [[Linux kernel]] are available for a wider range of processor architectures than [[Microsoft Windows]], including [[PowerPC]] and [[SPARC]]. None of these can match the sheer popularity of the [[x86]] architecture, nevertheless they do have significant numbers of users; Windows remains unavailable for these alternative architectures, although there have been such ports of it in the past.  . 

The most obvious complaint against FOSS revolves around the fact that making money through some traditional methods, such as the sale of the use of individual copies and [[patent]] [[Royalties|royalty]] payments, is much more difficult and sometimes impractical with FOSS. Moreover, many see{{Who|date=September 2007}} the introduction of FOSS as damaging to the market for commercial software. <ref>"[...] the documents show that while Microsoft may be dismissive of open source software in public, it considers it a serious competitor in private." -- quote from the "[[Microsoft Halloween documents leak#Documents I and II|Documents_I_and_II]]" subsection of [[Microsoft Halloween documents leak]] article (specific version: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Microsoft_Halloween_documents_leak&oldid=280819567 circa 31 March 2009] (q.v.) Retrieved 2009-April 27.)</ref><ref>The [http://www.catb.org/~esr/halloween/halloween6.html "Halloween VI" document] appears to give convincing evidence that Microsoft had their reasons for trying to argue against the popularity of Gnu/Linux and other [[Free and open source software]]. </ref><ref>Bill Gates, in his [http://www.startupgallery.org/gallery/notesViewer.php?ii=76_4&p=5 reply] after the public response to his own 1976 [[Open letter to hobbyists]], said "Unfortunately, some of the companies I have talked to about microcomputer software are reluctant to have it distributed to the hobbyist, some of whom will steal it, when [...]". </ref>  Most software development companies sell licenses to use individual copies of software as their primary source of income, using a combination of [[trade secret]]s and [[copyright]], [[patent]], and [[trademark]] laws (collectively called [[intellectual property rights]] laws).{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Fees from sale and licensing of commercial software are the primary source of income for companies that sell software.  . 

Open source software has a large number of alternative funding streams, which are actually better-connected to the real costs of creating and maintaining software{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}. After all, the cost of making a copy of a software program is essentially zero, so per-use fees are perhaps unreasonable. At one time, open-source software development was almost entirely volunteer-driven, and although this is true for many small projects, many alternative funding streams have been identified and employed for FOSS: . 

* Give away the program and charge for installation and support (used by many [[Linux distributions]]). 
* "[[Commoditizing the complement|Commoditize complements]]": make a product cheaper or free so that people are more likely to purchase a related product or service you do sell. 
* Cost avoidance / cost sharing: many developers need a product, so it makes sense to share development costs (this is the genesis of the [[X Window System]] and the [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] web server). 
* [[Donation]]s
* [[Crowd funding]] . 

Increasingly, FOSS is developed by commercial organizations. In 2004, [[Andrew Morton (computer programmer)|Andrew Morton]] noted that 37,000 of the 38,000 recent patches in the [[Linux kernel]] were created by developers directly paid to develop the Linux kernel. Many projects, such as the X Window System and Apache, have had commercial development as a primary source of improvements since their inception. This trend has accelerated over time{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}.  . 

There are some{{Who|date=December 2011}} who counter that the commercialization of FOSS is a poorly devised business model because commercial FOSS companies answer to parties with opposite agendas. On one hand commercial FOSS companies answer to volunteers developers, who are difficult to keep on a schedule, and on the other hand they answer to shareholders, who are expecting a return on their investment.  Often FOSS development is not on a schedule and therefore it may have an adverse effect on a commercial FOSS company releasing software on time. <ref>[http://www.packettrap.com/pdf/white_paper_open_source.pdf Integrating Open Source in Commercial Solutions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . 

== Innovation == . 

Dr. R. Keith Sawyer claimed in a article on [[Huffington Post]] 2007 that Open-source software are more derivative than innovative, with Linux being a derivative of Unix, and Firefox not being different from any other browser. <ref>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-r-keith-sawyer/open-source-is-not-innova_b_53256.html</ref> [[Gary Hamel]] counters this claim by saying that quantifying who or what is innovative is impossible. <ref>http://opensource.com/business/11/2/whos-really-innovative</ref>  . 

The implementation of compatible FOSS replacements for proprietary software is encouraged by the [[Free Software Foundation]] to make it possible for their users to use FOSS instead of proprietary software, for example they have been listed [[GNU Octave]], an API-compatible replacement for [[MATLAB]], as one of their [[Free Software Foundation#High priority projects|high priority projects]], in the past this list contained free binary compatible Java and CLI implementations, like [[GNU Classpath]] and [[DotGNU]]. Thus even “derivative” developments are important in the opinion of many people from FOSS. However, there is no quantitative analysis, if FOSS is less innovative than proprietary software, since there are derivative/reimplementing proprietary developments, too.  . 

Some of the largest well-known FOSS projects are either legacy code (e.g., FreeBSD or Apache) developed a long time ago independently of the [[free software movement]], or by companies like [[Netscape]] (which open-sourced its code with the hope that they can compete better), or by companies like [[MySQL]] which use FOSS to lure customers for its more expensive licensed product. However, it is notable that most of these projects have seen [[Rewrite (programming)|major or even complete rewrites]] (in the case of the Mozilla and Apache 2 code, for example) and do not contain much of the original code.  . 

Innovations have come, and continue to come, from the open-source world:
* [[GmailFS]] is a good example of the collaborative nature of much open-source development. Building on [[Filesystem in Userspace|FUSE]] (which allows filesystems to be implemented in userspace, instead of as code that needs to be loaded into the kernel) combined with [http://sourceforge.net/projects/libgmail libgmail], which is a [[Python (programming language)|Python]] library for programmatic access to a user's [[Gmail]] message store, the result is the ability to use the multiple gigabytes of Gmail message space as a fileserver accessible from anywhere on the Internet. 
* [[Perl]], the pioneering open-source scripting language, made popular many features, like [[regular expressions]] and [[associative array]]s, that were unusual at the time. The newer [[Python (programming language)|Python]] language continues this innovation, with features like functional constructs and class-dictionary unification. 
* [[dcraw]] is an open-source tool for decoding [[RAW format|RAW-format]] images from a variety of [[digital camera]]s, which can produce better images than the closed-source tools provided by the camera vendors themselves. 
* A number of laptop models are available with a particular emphasis on multimedia capabilities. While these invariably come preinstalled with a copy of Microsoft Windows, some of them<ref>[http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/07/22/HNqosmio_1.html Toshiba launches multimedia Qosmio notebooks | InfoWorld | News | 2004-07-22 | By Martyn Williams, IDG News Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,112577,00.asp PC World - Acer Readies New Notebook, Tablet PC<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> also offer an alternative "[[Instant on|fast-boot]]" mode (such as [[HyperSpace (software)|Phoenix HyperSpace]]) based on GNU/Linux. This gets around the long time it can take to boot up Windows. 
* [[Songbird (software)|Songbird]], [[Amarok (software)|Amarok]] and [[Exaile]] are FOSS music players that integrate internet-based data sources to an unprecedented degree, taking song information from [[MusicBrainz]], related track information from [[last.fm]], album cover art from [[amazon.com]] and displaying an artist's Wikipedia page within the player. 
* While admittedly inspired by [[Mac OS X]]'s [[Quartz (graphics layer)|Quartz]] graphics layer, [[Compiz Fusion]] has pioneered the concept of "plug in" window decorators and animation effects. Users can develop their own creative and unique effects. 
* Open-source telecommunication products, such as the [[Asterisk (PBX)|Asterisk PBX]], have revolutionized the ICT industry. <ref>[http://www.ictinnovations.com/content/open-source-voice-applications Open Source in ICT Industry]</ref>
* There are substantial efforts towards the implementation of a [[semantic desktop]] in FOSS communities. 
* Today's desktop environments are innovating regarding their unique idea of a [[Social Desktop]]. 
* Many academic research projects release their results as FOSS.  .

In its 2008 Annual Report, Microsoft stated that FOSS business models challenge its license-based software model and that the firms who use these business models do not bear the cost for their software development{{Clarify|date=June 2009}}. The company also stated in the report:<ref>[http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000119312508162768/d10k.htm Annual Report on Form 10-K]</ref><ref>[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10005379-16.html?hhTest=1 Microsoft's annual report: Open-source mental block | The Open Road - The Business and Politics of Open Source by Matt Asay - CNET News.com]</ref>
