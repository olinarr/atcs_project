'''Nuclear warfare''' (sometimes '''atomic warfare''' or '''thermonuclear warfare'''), is a military conflict or political strategy in which [[nuclear weapon|nuclear weaponry]] is used to inflict damage on an opponent. Compared to [[conventional warfare]], nuclear warfare can be vastly more destructive in range and extent of damage, and in a much shorter time scale. A major nuclear exchange could have severe long-term effects, primarily from [[radiation]] release, but also from the production of high levels of atmospheric pollution leading to a "[[nuclear winter]]" that could last for decades, centuries, or even millennia after the initial attack. <ref>[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=940&page=155 National Academy of Sciences]</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9056451/nuclear-winter Encyclopædia Britannica.]</ref> A large nuclear war is considered to bear [[existential risk]] for civilization on Earth. <ref>[http://www.thebulletin.org/content/doomsday-clock/overview Overview of the Doomsday Clock] from [http://thebulletin.org The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]</ref><ref>The Nuclear Winter: The World After Nuclear War, Sagan, Carl et al., Sidgwick & Jackson, 1985</ref> . 

Only [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|two nuclear weapons]] have been used in the course of warfare, both by the [[United States]] near the end of [[World War II]]. On August 6, 1945, a [[uranium]] gun-type device (code name "[[Little Boy]]") was detonated over the [[Japan|Japanese]] city of [[Hiroshima]]. Three days later, on August 9, a [[plutonium]] implosion-type device (code name "[[Fat Man]]") was exploded over [[Nagasaki, Japan]]. These two [[bombings]] resulted in the deaths of approximately 200,000 Japanese people (mostly civilians) from acute injuries sustained in the detonations. <ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.rerf.or.jp/general/qa_e/qa1.html |title = Frequently Asked Questions #1 |publisher=[[Radiation Effects Research Foundation]] |quote=total number of deaths is not known precisely ... acute (within two to four months) deaths ... Hiroshima ... 90,000－166,000 ...  Nagasaki ... 60,000－80,000 | accessdate = Sept. 18, 2007}}</ref> . 

After World War II, nuclear weapons were also developed by the [[Soviet Union]] (1940's), the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] (1950's), and the [[People's Republic of China]] (1960's), which contributed to the state of conflict and extreme tension that became known as the [[Cold War]]. In the 1970s, [[India]], and in the 1990s, [[Pakistan]], two countries that were openly hostile toward each other, developed nuclear weapons. [[Israel]] (1960's) and [[North Korea]] (2000's) are also thought to have developed stocks of nuclear weapons, and have made the political decision to retain them to the present time. [[South Africa]] also manufactured several complete nuclear weapons in the 1980's, but subsequently became [[South Africa and weapons of mass destruction|the first country to voluntarily destroy their domestically-made weapons stocks]] and abandon further production (1990's). <ref name='GlobSec1'>http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/rsa/nuke.htm</ref> . 

Nuclear weapons have been detonated on over two thousand occasions for [[nuclear weapons testing|testing purposes]] and demonstrations. <ref name='NukeTests'>http://archive.greenpeace.org/comms/nukes/ctbt/read9.html</ref> . 

After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the resultant end of the Cold War, the threat of a major nuclear war between the [[superpower|two nuclear superpowers]] was generally thought to have declined. Since then, concern over nuclear weapons has shifted to the prevention of localized nuclear conflicts resulting from [[nuclear proliferation]], and the threat of [[nuclear terrorism]].  . 

==Types of nuclear warfare==. 
The possibility of using nuclear weapons in war is usually divided into two subgroups, each with different effects and potentially fought with different types of nuclear armaments.  . 

The first, a ''limited nuclear war'' (sometimes ''attack'' or ''exchange''), refers to a small scale use of nuclear weapons by two (or more) belligerents. A "limited nuclear war" could include targeting military facilities - either as an attempt to pre-emptively cripple the enemy's ability to attack as a defensive measure, or as a prelude to an invasion by conventional forces, as an offensive measure. This term could apply to ''any'' small-scale use of nuclear weapons that may involve military or civilian targets (or both).{{Dubious|date=April 2012}} {{Whom?|date=April 2012}} . 

The second, a ''full-scale nuclear war'', could consist of large numbers of nuclear weapons used in an attack aimed at an entire country, including military, economic, and civilian targets. Such an attack would almost certainly destroy the entire economic, social, and military infrastructure of the target nation, and would probably have a devastating effect on Earth's biosphere.  . 

Some [[Cold War]] strategists such as [[Henry Kissinger]]<ref>http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/multimedia/video/2008/wallace/kissinger_henry_t.html</ref> argue that a limited nuclear war ''could'' be possible between two heavily armed superpowers (such as the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]). Some predict, however, that a limited war could potentially "[[Conflict escalation|escalate]]" into a full-scale nuclear war. Others{{Who|date=April 2012}} have called limited nuclear war "global nuclear holocaust in slow motion" - arguing that once such a war took place, others would be sure to follow over a period of decades, effectively rendering the planet uninhabitable in the same way that a "full-scale nuclear war" between superpowers would, only taking a much longer (and arguably more agonizing) path to the same result.  . 

Even the most optimistic predictions of the effects of a major nuclear exchange foresee the death of many millions of victims within a very short period of time. More pessimistic predictions argue that a full-scale nuclear war could potentially bring about the [[human extinction|extinction of the human race]], or at least its ''near'' extinction, with only a relatively small number of survivors (mainly in remote areas) and a reduced [[quality of life]] and [[life expectancy]] for centuries afterward. Such a horrific catastrophe would almost certainly cause permanent damage to most complex life on the planet, its ecosystems, and the global climate - particularly if predictions about the production of a [[nuclear winter]] are accurate.  . 

A study presented at the annual meeting of the [[American Geophysical Union]] in December 2006 asserted that even a small-scale regional nuclear war could produce as many direct fatalities as all of [[World War II]] and disrupt the global climate for a decade or more. In a regional nuclear conflict scenario in which two opposing nations in the [[subtropics]] each used 50 Hiroshima-sized nuclear weapons (ca. 15 kiloton each) on major population centers, the researchers predicted fatalities ranging from 2.6 million to 16.7 million per country. Also, they estimated that as much as five million tons of [[soot]] could be released, producing a cooling of several degrees over large areas of North America and [[Eurasia]] (including most of the grain-growing regions). The cooling would last for years and could be "catastrophic", according to the researchers. <ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/12/061211090729.htm ScienceDaily - Regional Nuclear War Could Devastate Global Climate]</ref> . 

Either a limited or full-scale nuclear exchange could occur during an ''accidental nuclear war'', in which the use of nuclear weapons is triggered unintentionally. Possible triggers for this scenario have included malfunctioning early warning devices and/or targeting computers, deliberate malfeasance by rogue military commanders, consequences of an accidental straying of warplanes into enemy airspace, reactions to unannounced missile tests during tense diplomatic periods, reactions to military exercises, mistranslated or misscommunicated messages, and others. A number of these scenarios actually occured during the Cold War, though none resulted in the use of nuclear weapons. <ref>Alan F. Philips, [http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/issues/accidents/20-mishaps-maybe-caused-nuclear-war.htm 20 Mishaps That Might Have Started Accidental Nuclear War]. </ref> Many such scenarios have been depicted in [[nuclear weapons in popular culture|popular culture]], such as in the 1962 novel ''[[Fail-Safe (novel)|Fail-Safe]]'' (released as a film in 1964), and the film ''[[Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'', also released in 1964.  .

During the final stages of [[World War II]] in 1945, the United States conducted two atomic bombings against the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the first on August 6, 1945, and the second on August 9, 1945. These two events are the only use of [[nuclear weapon|nuclear weapons]] in war to date. <ref>{{Cite book

For six months before the atomic bombings, the United States intensely [[Strategic bombing during World War II#United States strategic bombing of Japan|fire-bombed 67 Japanese cities]]. Together with the United Kingdom and the [[Republic of China]], the United States called for the unconditional surrender of Japan in the [[Potsdam Declaration]] issued July 26, 1945. The Japanese government [[mokusatsu|ignored]] this ultimatum. By [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] of President [[Harry S. Truman]], the U.S. employed the uranium-type [[nuclear weapon]] code named "[[Little Boy]]" on the city of [[Hiroshima]] on Monday, August 6, 1945,<ref name="DOE-HIRO">{{cite web

Six days after the detonation over Nagasaki, on August 15, 1945, Japan announced [[Surrender of Japan|its surrender]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]], signing the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|Instrument of Surrender]] on September 2, 1945, officially ending the [[Pacific War]] and, therefore, World War II, as [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] had already signed its [[German Instrument of Surrender|Instrument of Surrender]] on May 7, 1945, ending the [[European Theatre of World War II|war in Europe]]. The two atomic bombings led, in part, to [[Post-Occupation Japan|post-war Japan's]] adopting of the [[Three Non-Nuclear Principles]], which forbade the nation from developing nuclear armaments. <ref>{{cite web| last = Koizumi | first = Junichiro | authorlink = Junichiro Koizumi | title = Address by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi at the Hiroshima Memorial Service for the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony | publisher=Prime Minister of Japan and His Cabinet | date = August 6, 2005 | url = http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/koizumispeech/2005/08/06aisatu_e.html | accessdate = Nov. 28, 2007 }}</ref> The role of the bombings in the surrender of Japan, the [[ethics|ethical]] justification of the US for using them, as well as their [[strategy|strategic]] importance, is [[Debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|still hotly debated]]. <ref name="Military History 1994">The Collins Encyclopedia of Military History, Dupuy & Dupuy, BCA 1994, page 1308</ref> . 

===Immediately after the Japan bombings===. 
Immediately after the atomic bombings of Japan, the status of atomic weapons in international and military relations was unclear. Presumably, the United States hoped atomic weapons could offset the Soviet Union's larger conventional ground forces in Eastern Europe, and possibly be used to pressure Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] into making concessions. Under Stalin, the Soviet Union pursued its own atomic capabilities through a combination of scientific research and [[espionage]] directed against the American program. The Soviets believed that the Americans, with their limited nuclear arsenal, were unlikely to engage in any new world wars, while the Americans were not confident they could prevent a Soviet takeover of Europe, despite their atomic advantage.  . 

Within the United States the authority to produce and develop nuclear weapons was removed from military control and put instead under the civilian control of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]]. This decision reflected an understanding that nuclear weapons had unique risks and benefits that were separate from other military technology known at the time.  . 

[[Image:Convair B-36 Peacemaker.jpg|thumb|right|[[Convair B-36]] bomber]]
For several years after [[World War II]], the US developed and maintained a strategic force based on the [[Convair B-36]] [[bomber]] that would be able to attack any potential enemy from bomber bases in the US. It deployed atomic bombs around the world for potential use in conflicts. Over a period of a few years, many in the US defense community became increasingly convinced of the invincibility of the United States to a nuclear attack. Indeed, it became generally believed that the threat of nuclear war would deter any strike against the United States.  . 

Many proposals were suggested to put all US nuclear weapons under international control (by the newly formed [[United Nations]], for example) as an effort to deter both their usage and an arms race. However no terms could be arrived at that would be agreed upon by both the US and the USSR. 
[[Image:US and USSR nuclear stockpiles.svg|thumb|right|US and USSR nuclear stockpiles.]] . 

On August 29, 1949 the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|USSR]] tested its [[RDS-1|first nuclear weapon]] at [[Semipalatinsk Test Site|Semipalatinsk]] in [[Kazakhstan]] (see also [[Soviet atomic bomb project]]). Scientists in the United States from the Manhattan Project had warned that, in time, the Soviet Union would certainly develop nuclear capabilities of its own. Nevertheless, the effect upon military thinking and planning in the US was dramatic, primarily because American military strategists had not anticipated the Soviets would "catch up" so soon. However, at this time, they had not discovered that the Russians had conducted significant [[nuclear espionage]] of the project from spies at Los Alamos, the most significant of which was done by the theoretical physicist [[Klaus Fuchs]]. The first Soviet bomb was more or less a deliberate copy of the [[Fat Man]] [[plutonium]] device.  . 

With the monopoly over nuclear technology broken, worldwide nuclear proliferation accelerated. The [[United Kingdom]] tested its first independent atomic bomb in 1952, followed by [[France]] in 1960 and then the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1964. While much smaller than the arsenals of the US and the USSR, Western Europe's nuclear reserves were nevertheless a significant factor in strategic planning during the [[Cold War]]. A top-secret [[White paper|White Paper]], compiled by the [[Royal Air Force]] and produced for the British Government in 1959, estimated that British atomic bombers were capable of destroying key cities and military targets in the Soviet Union, with an estimated 16 million deaths in the USSR (half of whom were estimated to be killed on impact and the rest fatally injured) ''before'' bomber aircraft from the US [[Strategic Air Command]] reached their targets.  .

===The 1950s===. 
Though the USSR had nuclear weapon capabilities in the beginning of the [[Cold War]], the US still had an advantage in terms of bombers and weapons. In any exchange of hostilities, the US would have been capable of bombing the USSR, while the USSR would have more difficulty carrying out the reverse mission.  . 

The widespread introduction of [[Jet engine|jet]]-powered [[interceptor aircraft]] upset this imbalance somewhat by reducing the effectiveness of the US bomber fleet. In 1949 [[Curtis LeMay]] was placed in command of the [[Strategic Air Command]] and instituted a program to update the bomber fleet to one that was all-jet. During the early 1950s the [[B-47]] and [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] were introduced, providing the ability to bomb the USSR more easily.

Before the development of a capable strategic missile force in the Soviet Union, much of the war-fighting doctrine held by western nations revolved around using a large number of smaller nuclear weapons used in a tactical role. It is debatable whether such use could be considered "limited" however, because it was believed that the US would use their own strategic weapons (mainly bombers at the time) should the USSR deploy any kind of nuclear weapon against civilian targets. [[Douglas MacArthur]], an American general, was fired by President [[Harry Truman]], partially because he persistently requested permission to use his own discretion in deciding whether to use atomic weapons on the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1951 during the [[Korean War]]. <ref>[http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/China/Nuclear/5630.html Nuclear Chronology 1945-1959]</ref>{{Dead link|date=July 2010}} [[Mao Zedong]], China's communist leader, gave the impression that he would welcome a nuclear war with the capitalists because it would annihilate their imperialist system. <ref>"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946612-2,00.html Instant Wisdom: Beyond the Little Red Book]".

[[File:Exercise Desert Rock I (Buster-Jangle Dog) 002.jpg|right|thumb|The U.S. conducted hundreds of [[Nuclear testing|nuclear tests]] at the [[Nevada Test Site]].]]
Several scares about the increasing ability of the USSR's strategic bomber forces surfaced during the 1950s. The defensive response by the US was to deploy a fairly strong "layered defense" consisting of [[interceptor aircraft]] and [[anti-aircraft missile|anti-aircraft missiles]], like the [[Project Nike|Nike]], and guns, like the [[Skysweeper]], near larger cities. However, this was a small response compared to the construction of a huge fleet of nuclear bombers. The principal nuclear strategy was to massively penetrate the USSR. Because such a large area could not be defended against this overwhelming attack in any credible way, the USSR would lose any exchange.  . 

This logic became ingrained in US nuclear doctrine and persisted for much of the duration of the [[Cold War]]. As long as the strategic US nuclear forces could overwhelm their USSR counterparts, a Soviet preemptive strike could be averted. Moreover, the USSR could not afford to build any reasonable counterforce, as the economic output of the United States was far larger than that of the Soviets, and they would be unable to achieve "nuclear parity".  . 

Soviet nuclear doctrine, however, did not match US nuclear doctrine. <ref>[http://kms1.isn.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/46280/ipublicationdocument_singledocument/14933a8e-14e8-43d7-a257-6bdab65dba50/en/ZB79_000.pdf Military Planning for European Theatre Conflict During the Cold War]</ref> Soviet planning ''expected'' a large-scale nuclear exchange, followed by a "conventional war" which itself would involve heavy use of tactical nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, US doctrine rather assumed that Soviet doctrine was similar, with the ''mutual'' in [[Mutually Assured Destruction]] necessarily requiring that the other side see things in much the same way, rather than believing - as the Soviets did - that they could fight a large-scale, "combined nuclear and conventional" war.  . 

A revolution in nuclear strategic thought occurred with the introduction of the [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM), which the USSR first successfully tested in August 1957. In order to deliver a warhead to a target, a missile was much faster and more cost-effective than a bomber, and enjoyed a higher survivability due to the enormous difficulty of interception of the ICBMs (due to their high altitude and extreme speed). The USSR could now afford to achieve nuclear parity with the US in terms of raw numbers, although for a time, they appeared to have chosen not to.  . 

Photos of Soviet missile sites set off a wave of panic in the US military, something the launch of [[Sputnik]] would do for the American public a few months later. Politicians, notably then-[[United States Senate|US Senator]] [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy|John F. Kennedy]] suggested that a "[[missile gap]]" existed between the Soviets and the US. <!--This was a savvy political ploy, as the US administration almost certainly knew better, and also knew that they could not be corrected without violating military security. It should be pointed out, though, that Dwight D. Eisenhower's own [[Gaither Report|Gaither panel]] had also overestimated Soviet nuclear capabilities in their 1957 report.[http://www.politicalreviewnet.com/polrev/reviews/DIPH/R_0145_2096_014_19322.asp][http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people/York/york88-con4.html] One result of this, however, was that the Soviets ''believed'' the vulnerability actually existed, with resulting temptation; luckily, cooler heads prevailed. After Kennedy won the 1960 Presidential election, the "missile gap" (conveniently) went away.--><!--This political interpretation needs to be attributed or made neutral.--> The US military gave missile development programs the highest national priority, and several [[reconnaissance aircraft|spy aircraft]] and [[reconnaissance satellite]]s were designed and deployed to observe Soviet progress.  . 

Early ICBMs and bombers were relatively inaccurate, which led to the concept of [[countervalue]] strikes — attacks directly on the enemy population, which would theoretically lead to a collapse of the enemy's will to fight. During the Cold War the USSR invested in extensive protected civilian infrastructure, such as large "nuclear-proof" bunkers and non-perishable food stores. In the US, by comparison, smaller scale [[civil defense]] programs were instituted starting in the 1950s, where schools and other public buildings had basements stocked with non-perishable food supplies, canned water, first aid, and [[dosimeter]] and [[Geiger counter]] radiation-measuring devices. Many of the locations were given "[[Fallout Shelter]]" designation signs. Also, [[CONELRAD]] Radio information systems were adopted, whereby the commercial radio sector would broadcast on two AM frequencies in the event of a Civil Defense (CD) emergency. These two frequencies can still be seen on 1950's vintage radios on online auction sites and museums, with many of these radios are still in use on tabletops across America. Also, the occasional backyard [[fallout shelter]] was built by private individuals.  . 

===1960s===. 
[[Image:Cuban missiles.jpg|thumb|right|[[F-101 Voodoo|RF-101 Voodoo]] reconnaissance photograph of the MRBM launch site in [[San Cristóbal, Cuba]] (1962)]]
An extensive, complicated, and worrisome situation developed in 1962, in what is called the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. The Soviet Union placed medium-range ballistic missiles {{convert|90|mi|km}} from the US - a move considered by many{{Who|date=August 2010}} as a direct response to American [[Jupiter missile|Jupiter missiles]] placed in [[Turkey]]. After intense negotiations, the Soviets ended up removing the missiles from Cuba and decided to institute a massive weapons-building program of their own. In exchange, the US dismantled its launch sites in Turkey, although this was done secretly and not publicly revealed for over two decades. [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] did not even reveal this part of the agreement when he came under fire by political opponents for mishandling the crisis.  . 

By the late 1960s, the number of ICBMs and warheads was so high on both sides that it was believed that both the US and the USSR were capable of completely destroying the infrastructure and population of the other country. Thus, a [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] system known as [[mutually assured destruction]] (or ''MAD'') came into being. It was thought that any full-scale exchange between the powers could not produce a victorious side, and thus neither would willingly risk initiating one.  . 

<!--these next two paragraphs should be elsewhere in the text, not in "1960s"-->
One drawback of the MAD doctrine was the possibility of a nuclear war occurring without either side intentionally striking first. [[Warning system\Early Warning Systems]] (EWS) were notoriously error-prone. For example, on 78 occasions in 1979 alone, a "missile display conference" was called to evaluate detections that were "potentially threatening to the North American continent". Some of these were trivial errors and were spotted quickly, but several went to more serious levels. On September 26, 1983, [[Stanislav Petrov]] received convincing indications of a US first strike launch against the USSR, but positively identified the warning as a false alarm. Though it is unclear what role Petrov's actions played in preventing a nuclear war during this incident, he has been honored by the United Nations for his actions.  . 

Similar incidents happened many times in the US, due to failed computer chips,<ref>[http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/1998/01/00_phillips_20-mishaps.htm June 80: Faulty Computer Chip], ''20 Mishaps that Might Have Started Accidental Nuclear War'', by Alan F. Phillips, M.D., January 1998, Nuclear Age Peace Foundation</ref> misidentifications of large flights of geese, test programs, and bureaucratic failures to notify early warning military personnel of legitimate launches of test or weather missiles. For many years, US strategic bombers were kept airborne on a daily rotating basis "around the clock", until the number and severity of accidents persuaded policymakers it was not worthwhile. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} . 

===1970s===. 
By the late 1970s, citizens in the US and USSR (and indeed the entire world) had been living with the concept of [[Mutual assured destruction|MAD]] for about a decade, and it became deeply ingrained into the popular culture. Such an exchange would have killed many millions of individuals directly, and possibly induced a [[nuclear winter]] which could have led to the death of a large portion of humanity and - potentially - the collapse of global civilization.  . 

On May 18, 1974, [[India]] conducted its first nuclear test in the [[Pokhran]] test range. The name of the operation was [[Smiling Buddha]], and India termed the test as a "peaceful nuclear explosion".  . 

According to the 1980 [[United Nations]] report ''General and Complete Disarmament: Comprehensive Study on Nuclear Weapons: Report of the Secretary-General'', it was estimated that there were a total of about 40,000 nuclear warheads in existence at that time, with a potential combined explosive yield of approximately 13,000 [[TNT equivalent|megatons]]. By comparison, when the volcano [[Mount Tambora]] erupted in 1815 - turning 1816 into the [[Year Without A Summer]] due to the levels of ash expelled) - it exploded with a force of roughly 1,000 megatons. Many people believed that a full-scale nuclear war would result in the [[human extinction|extinction of the human species]], though not all analysts agreed on the assumptions required for these models.  . 

The idea that any nuclear conflict would eventually escalate was a challenge for military strategists. This challenge was particularly severe for the United States and its [[NATO]] allies because it was believed (until the 1970s) that a Soviet tank invasion of Western [[Europe]] would quickly overwhelm NATO conventional forces, leading to the necessity of the West escalating to the use of tactical nuclear weapons.  . 

This strategy had one major (and possibly critical) flaw, which was soon realised by military analysts but highly underplayed by the US military: conventional [[NATO]] forces in the European theatre of war were far outnumbered by similar Soviet and [[Warsaw Pact]] forces, and it was assumed that in case of a major Soviet attack (commonly envisioned as the "Red tanks rolling towards the [[North Sea]]" scenario) that NATO - in the face of quick conventional defeat - would soon have no other choice but to resort to tactical nuclear strikes against these forces. Most analysts agreed that once the first nuclear exchange had occurred, escalation to global nuclear war would likely become inevitable.  . 

===The 1980s===.

[[File:US nuclear strike map.svg|right|thumb|375px|[[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]]-estimated primary targets for Soviet [[ICBM]]s.

In the late 1970s and, particularly, during the early 1980s under US President [[Ronald Reagan]], the US renewed its commitment to a more powerful military, which required a large increase in spending on US military programs. These programs, which were originally part of the defense budget of US President [[Jimmy Carter]], included spending on conventional and nuclear weapons systems. Under Reagan, defensive systems like the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] became emphasized as well.  . 

Another major shift in nuclear doctrine was the development and the improvement of the [[submarine]]-launched, nuclear-armed, ballistic missile, or [[Submarine-launched ballistic missile|SLBM]]. It was hailed by many military theorists as a weapon that would make nuclear war less likely. SLBMs - which can move with "stealth" (greatly lessened detectibility) virtually anywhere in the world - give a nation a "[[second strike]]" capability (i.e. after absorbing a "first strike"). Before the advent of the SLBM, thinkers feared that a nation might be tempted to initiate a first strike if it felt confident that such a strike would incapacitate the nuclear arsenal of its enemy, making retaliation impossible. With the advent of SLBMs, no nation could be certain that a first strike would incapacitate its enemy's entire nuclear arsenal. To the contrary, it would have to fear a (near certain) retaliatory second strike from SLBMs. Thus a first strike was a much less of feasible (or desirable) option, and a (deliberately initiated) nuclear war was thought to be less likely to start.  . 

However, it was soon realized that submarines could "sneak up" close to enemy coastlines and decrease the "warning time" (the time between detection of the missile launch and the impact of the missile) from as much as half an hour to possibly under three minutes. This effect was especially significant to the United States, Britain, India and China, whose capitals all lay within {{convert|100|mi|km. |-1.6}} of their coasts. Moscow was much more secure from this type of threat, due to its considerable distance from the sea. This greatly increased the credibility of a "surprise first strike" by one faction and (theoretically) made it possible to knock out or disrupt the [[chain of command]] of a target nation before any counterstrike could be ordered (known as a "decapitation strike". It strengthened the notion that a nuclear war could possibly be "won" - resulting not only in greatly increased tensions and increasing calls for [[fail-deadly]] control systems, but also in a dramatic increase in military spending. The submarines and their missile systems were very expensive, and one fully-equipped nuclear powered and armed missile submarine could cost more than the entire [[Measures of national income and output#Gross National Product|GNP]] of a [[developing country]]). <ref>{{cite news|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/subs/history/timeline/cost/index.html|title=The Cost of Submarines|accessdate=2008-07-13|work=Fast Attacks and Boomers}}</ref> It was also calculated, however, that the greatest cost came in the development of ''both'' sea- and land-based anti-submarine defenses and in improving and strengthening the "chain of command", and as a result, military spending skyrocketed.  . 

South Africa developed a nuclear weapon capability during the 1970s and early 1980s. It was operational for a brief period before being dismantled in the early 1990s.  . 

On Sept. 1, 1983, [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]] was shot down by Soviet jet fighters.  On the 26th, a Soviet early warning station under the command of [[Stanislav Petrov]] falsely detected 5 inbound [[intercontinental ballistic missile|intercontinental ballistic missiles]] from the US. Petrov correctly assessed the situation as a false alarm, and hence did not report his finding to his superiors.  It is quite possible that his actions prevented "World War III", as the Soviet policy at that time was immediate nuclear response upon discovering inbound ballistic missiles.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} . 

The world came unusually close to nuclear war - although perhaps not as close as during the Cuban Missile Crisis - when the Soviet Union thought that the NATO military exercise [[Able Archer 83]] was a ruse or "cover up" to begin a nuclear first strike. The Soviets responded by raising readiness and preparing their nuclear arsenal for immediate use. Soviet fears of an attack went away once the exercise concluded without incident.  . 

===Post–Cold War===. 
Although the dissolution of the Soviet Union ended the Cold War and greatly reduced tensions between the United States and the [[Russian Federation]] (the Soviet Union's formal successor state), both nations remained in a "nuclear stand-off" due to the continuing presence of a very large number of deliverable nuclear warheads in both nations. Additionally, the end of the Cold War led the United States to become increasingly concerned with the development of nuclear technology by other nations outside of the former Soviet Union. In 1995, a branch of the US Strategic Command produced an outline of forward-thinking strategies in the document "[[Essentials of Post–Cold War Deterrence]]".  . 

The former chair of the United Nations disarmament committee stated that there are more than 16,000 strategic and tactical nuclear weapons ready for deployment and another 14,000 in storage, with the U.S. having nearly 7,000 ready for use and 3,000 in storage, and Russia having about 8,500 ready for use and 11,000 in storage. In addition, [[China]] is thought to possess about 400 nuclear weapons, [[United Kingdom|Britain]] about 200, [[France]] about 350, [[India]] about 120, and [[Pakistan]] about 90. [[North Korea]] is confirmed as having nuclear weapons, though it is not known how many, with most estimates between 1 and 10. [[Israel]] is also widely believed to [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|possess usable nuclear weapons]]. NATO has stationed about 480 American nuclear weapons in Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, and Turkey, and several other nations are thought to be in pursuit of an arsenal of their own. <ref>[http://lfpress.ca/newsstand/CityandRegion/2006/02/14/1441292-sun.html London Free Press - Disarmament expert warns of nuclear threat]</ref> . 

A key development in nuclear warfare during the decade of the 2000s and after has been the [[nuclear proliferation|proliferation]] of nuclear weapons to the [[developing world]], with [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] both publicly testing several nuclear devices, and [[North Korea]] conducting an underground nuclear test on October 9, 2006. The US Geological Survey measured a 4.2 magnitude earthquake in the area where the North Korean test is said to have occurred. A further test was announced by the North Korean government on May 25, 2009. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8067438.stm Urgent talks after N Korean test]</ref> [[Iran]], meanwhile, has embarked on a nuclear program which - while officially for civilian purposes - has come under close scrutiny by the United Nations and many individual states.  . 

Recent studies undertaken by the [[CIA]] cite the enduring India-Pakistan conflict as the one "flash point" most likely to escalate into a nuclear war. During the [[Kargil War]] in 1999, Pakistan came close to using its nuclear weapons in case the conventional military situation underwent further deterioration. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1989886.stm BBC News| South Asia| Pakistan 'prepared nuclear strike']</ref> Pakistan's foreign minister had even warned that it would "use any weapon in our arsenal", hinting at a nuclear strike against India. <ref>“Pakistan May Use Any Weapon,” The News, Islamabad,
May 31, 1999</ref> The statement was condemned by the international community, with Pakistan denying it later on. This conflict remains the only war (of any sort) between two declared nuclear powers. The [[2001-2002 India-Pakistan standoff]] again stoked fears of nuclear war between the two countries. Despite these very serious and relatively recent threats, relations between India and Pakistan have been improving somewhat over the last few years. A bus line directly linking Indian- and Pakistani-administered [[Kashmir]] has recently been established. However, with the [[2008 Mumbai attacks|November 26, 2008 Mumbai terror attacks]], India currently will not rule out war with Pakistan.  . 

Another potential geopolitical issue which is considered particularly worrisome by miliitary analysts is a possible conflict between the [[United States]] and the [[People's Republic of China]] over [[Taiwan]]. Although economic forces are thought to have decreased somewhat the possibility of a military conflict, there remains the worry that the increasing military buildup of ([[China]] is rapidly increasing their naval capacity, and that any move toward [[Taiwan independence]] could potentially spin out of control.  . 

[[Israel]] is thought to possess somewhere between one hundred and four hundred nuclear warheads. It has been asserted that the submarines which Israel received from [[Germany]] have been adapted to carry missiles with nuclear warheads, so as to give Israel a [[second strike]] capability. <ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2006/08/25/israel_buys_2_nuclear_capable_submarines_from_germany/ Israel buys 2 nuclear-capable submarines from Germany - The Boston Globe]</ref> Israel has been involved in wars with its neighbors in the [[Middle East]] (and with other "non-state actors") on numerous prior occasions, and its small geographic size and population could mean that, in the event of future wars, the Israeli military might have very little time to react to an invasion or other major threat. Such a situation could escalate to nuclear warfare very quickly in some scenarios.  . 

In the Persian Gulf, [[Iran]] appears to many observers to be in the process of developing a nuclear weapon, which has greatly heightened fears of a nuclear conflict and arms races in the Middle East - either with Israel or with one or more Arab states (a "Shia-Sunni" Conflict).  . 

===Sub-strategic use===. 
The above examples envisage nuclear warfare at a strategic level, i.e. [[total war]]. However, nuclear powers have the ability to undertake more limited engagements.  . 

"Sub-strategic use" includes the use of either "low-yield" tactical nuclear weapons, or of "scalable-yield" ("dialable-yield") [[strategic nuclear weapons]] in a very limited role, as compared to battlefield exchanges of larger-yield [[strategic nuclear weapons]]. This was described by the UK Parliamentary [[Defence Select Committee]] as "the launch of one or a limited number of missiles against an adversary as a means of conveying a political message, warning or demonstration of resolve". It is believed that all current nuclear weapons states possess tactical nuclear weapons, with the exception of the [[United Kingdom]], which decommissioned its tactical warheads in 1998. However, the UK does possess scalable-yield strategic warheads, and this technology tends to blur the difference between "strategic", "sub-strategic", and "tactical" use or weapons. American, French and British nuclear submarines are believed to carry at least ''some'' missiles with these types of high-tech warheads for this purpose - potentially allowing a strike as low as one [[kiloton]] (or less) against a single target. Only the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Republic of India]] have declarative, unqualified, unconditional "[[no first use]]" nuclear weapons policies.  . 

Commodore [[Tim Hare]], former Director of Nuclear Policy at the [[British Ministry of Defence]], has described "sub-strategic use" as offering the Government "an extra option in the escalatory process before it goes for an all-out strategic strike which would deliver unacceptable damage". <ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmdfence/986/98605.htm#a11 House of Commons - Defense - Eighth Report - THE 1998 STRATEGIC DEFENCE REVIEW]</ref> However, this sub-strategic capacity has been criticized as potentially increasing the "acceptability" of using nuclear weapons. The related consideration of new generations of limited-yield nuclear weapons by the United States (i.e. "bunker busters") has also alarmed [[anti-nuclear]] groups, who believe it will make the use of nuclear weapons "more acceptable" or likely.  . 

Also of note is that the United States adopted a policy in 1996 of allowing the targeting of its nuclear weapons at non-state actors armed with [[weapons of mass destruction]]. <ref>Daniel Plesch & Stephen Young, "Senseless policy", ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=sgsAAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]'', November/December 1998, page 4.  Fetched from URL on 18 April 2011. </ref> . 

==Nuclear terrorism==. 
{{Main|Nuclear terrorism}}
[[Nuclear terrorism]] by non-state organizations or actors (even individuals) is an largely unknown and understudied factor in nuclear deterrence thinking, as states possessing nuclear weapons are susceptible to retaliation in kind, while sub- or trans-state actors may be less so. The collapse of the Soviet Union has given rise to the possibility that former Soviet nuclear weapons might become available on the [[black market]] (so-called 'loose nukes'). While no warheads are known to have been mislaid, it has been alleged that at least some [[suitcase bomb|very small or suitcase-size bombs]] might be unaccounted for.  . 

A number other concerns have been expressed about the security of nuclear weapons in other, newer nuclear powers with relatively less stable governments, such as [[Pakistan]], but in each case, the fears have been addressed to some extent by statements and evidence provided by those nations, as well as cooperative programs between nations. Worry remains, however, in many circles that a relative decrease in security of nuclear weapons has emerged in recent years, and that terrorists or others may attempt to exert control over (or use) nuclear weapons, militarily applicable technology, or nuclear materials and fuel.  . 

Another possible nuclear terrorism threat are devices designed to disperse radioactive materials over a large area using conventional explosives, called [[dirty bomb|dirty bombs]]. The detonation of a "dirty bomb" would not cause a nuclear explosion, nor would it release enough radiation to kill or injure a lot of people. However, it could cause severe disruption and require potentially very costly decontamination procedures and increased spending on security measures. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/dirty-bombs-bg.html|title=Backgrounder on Dirty Bombs|author=US Nuclear Regulatory Commission|date=2007-05|accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref> .
