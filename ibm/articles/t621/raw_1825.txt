'''Nuclear terrorism''' denotes the use, or threat of the use, of [[nuclear weapon]]s or [[radiological weapon]]s in acts of [[terrorism]], including
attacks against facilities where radioactive materials are present. In [[legal]] terms, nuclear terrorism is an offense committed if a person unlawfully and intentionally “uses in any way radioactive material … with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury; or with the intent to cause substantial damage to property or to the
environment; or with the intent to compel a natural or legal person, an international organization or a State to do or refrain from doing an act”, according to 2005 United Nations [[International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} . 

The notion of terrorist organizations using nuclear weapons (especially very small ones, such as [[suitcase nuke]]s) has been a threat in American rhetoric and culture. It is considered plausible that terrorists could acquire a nuclear weapon. <ref>{{citation |url=

==Overview==. 
Nuclear terrorism could include:
* Acquiring or fabricating a nuclear weapon
* Fabricating a [[dirty bomb]]
* Attacking a nuclear reactor, e.g., by disrupting critical inputs (e.g. water supply)
* Attacking or taking over a nuclear-armed submarine, plane or base. <ref>{{citation |first=Tilman |last=Ruff |title=Nuclear terrorism |url=http://energyscience.org.au/FS10%20Nuclear%20Terrorism.pdf |publisher=energyscience.org.au |date=November 2006}}</ref> . 

U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] calls nuclear terrorism "the single most important national security threat that we face". <ref name=obam/>  In his first speech to the U.N. Security Council, President Obama said that "Just one nuclear weapon exploded in a city -- be it New York or Moscow, Tokyo or Beijing, London or Paris -- could kill hundreds of thousands of people". It would "destabilize our security, our economies, and our very way of life". <ref name=obam>{{cite web |url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/index.php/news-events/news/commentary/failure-to-imagine-worst |title=A Failure to Imagine the Worst |author=Graham Allison |date=January 26, 2010  |work=Foreign Policy }}</ref> . 

==History==. 
As early as December 1945, politicians worried about the possibility of smuggling nuclear weapons into the United States, though this was still in the context of a battle between the superpowers of the [[Cold War]]. Congressmen quizzed the "father of the atomic bomb," [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], about the possibility of detecting a smuggled atomic bomb: . 

{{quote|Sen. Millikin: We... have mine-detecting devices, which are rather effective... I was wondering if anything of that kind might be available to use as a defense against that particular type of use of atomic bombs. <br />
Dr. Oppenheimer: If you hired me to walk through the cellars of Washington to see whether there were atomic bombs, I think my most important tool would be a screwdriver to open the crates and look. I think that just walking by, swinging a little gadget would not give me the information. <ref>Alex Kingsbury, "[http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070218/26nuclear.b.htm History's Troubling Lessons]", ''U.S. News and World Report'' (February 18, 2007). </ref>}} . 

This sparked further work on the question of smuggled atomic devices during the 1950s.  . 

Discussions of non-state nuclear terrorism among experts go back at least to the 1970s.  In 1975 [[The Economist]] warned that "You can make a bomb with a few pounds of plutonium. By the mid-1980s the power stations may easily be turning out 200,000&nbsp;lb of the stuff each year. And each year, unless present methods are drastically changed, many thousands of pounds of it will be transferred from one plant to another as it proceeds through the fuel cycle. The dangers of robbery in transit are evident.... Vigorous co-operation between governments and the International Atomic Energy Agency could, even at this late stage, make the looming perils loom a good deal smaller."<ref>"Nuclear Terrorism," ''The Economist'' (January 25, 1975) p. 38. </ref>  And the New York Times commented in 1981 that The [[Nuclear Emergency Search Team]]'s "origins go back to the aftershocks of the [[Munich Olympic massacre]] in mid-1972. Until that time, no one in the United States Government had thought seriously about the menace of organized, international terrorism, much less nuclear terrorism. There was a perception in Washington that the value of what is called 'special nuclear material' - plutonium or highly enriched uranium - was so enormous that the strict financial accountability of the private contractors who dealt with it would be enough to protect it from falling into the wrong hands. But it has since been revealed that the physical safeguarding of bomb-grade material against theft was almost scandalously neglected."<ref>Larry Collins, "Combating Nuclear Terrorism," ''New York Times'' (December 14, 1980) Sec. 6 pg. 37. </ref> . 

This discussion took on a larger public character in the 1980s after [[NBC]] aired [[Special Bulletin]], a television dramatization of a nuclear terrorist attack on the United States. <ref>Sally Bedell, "A Realistic Film Stirs NBC Debate," ''New York Times'' (March 17, 1983) B13; Sally Bedell, "NBC Nuclear Terror Show Criticized," '' New York Times (March 22, 1983) C15; Aljean Harmetz, "NBC Film on Terror Wins Prize," ''New York Times'' (July 8, 1983) C19. </ref>  In 1986 a private panel of experts known as the [[International Task Force on the Prevention of Terrorism]] released a report urging all nuclear-armed states to beware the dangers of terrorism and work on equipping their nuclear arsenals with [[permissive action links]].  "The probability of nuclear terrorism," the experts warned, "is increasing and the consequences for urban and industrial societies could be catastrophic."<ref>D. Costello, "Experts Warn on Nuclear Terror," ''Courier-Mail'' (June 26, 1986). </ref> . 

==Radiological weapons==. 
It is feared that a terrorist group could detonate a radiological or '[[dirty bomb]]'. A 'dirty bomb' is composed of any radioactive source and a conventional explosive. The radioactive material is dispersed by the detonation of the explosive. Detonation of such a weapon is not as powerful as a nuclear blast, but can produce considerable radioactive [[fallout]]. There are other radiological weapons called radiological exposure devices where an explosive is not necessary. A radiological weapon may be very appealing to terrorist groups as it is highly successful in instilling fear and panic amongst a population (particularly because of the threat of [[radiation poisoning]]), and would contaminate the immediate area for some period of time, disrupting attempts to repair the damage. The economic losses could be enormous - easily reaching into the tens of billions of dollars.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} .

According to leaked diplomatic documents, [[Al-Qaeda]] is on the verge of producing radiological weapons, after sourcing nuclear material and recruiting rogue scientists to build "dirty bombs". <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/alqaeda-moving-world-towards-nuclear-911-20110202-1adqd.html |title=Al-Qaeda moving world towards 'nuclear 9/11' |author= |date=February 3, 2011  |work=The Age |location=Melbourne}}</ref> . 

==Alleged nuclear terrorism attempts and plans==. 
In June 2002, U.S. citizen [[José Padilla (alleged terrorist)|Jose Padilla]] was arrested for allegedly planning a radiological attack on the city of Chicago; however, he was never charged with such conduct.  He was instead convicted of charges that he conspired to "murder, kidnap and maim" people overseas.  . 

In November 2006, [[MI5]] warned that [[al-Qaida]] were planning on using nuclear weapons against cities in the United Kingdom by obtaining the bombs via [[clandestine operation|clandestine]] means.[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/terrorism/story/0,,1947295,00.html] . 

In June 2007, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] released to the press the name of [[Adnan Gulshair el Shukrijumah]], allegedly the operations leader for developing tactical plans for detonating nuclear bombs in several American cities simultaneously. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,277614,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Feds Hoped to Snag Bin Laden Nuke Expert in JFK Bomb Plot | date=June 4, 2007}}</ref> . 

The [[Alexander Litvinenko poisoning]] with radioactive polonium "represents an ominous landmark: the beginning of an era of nuclear terrorism," according to Andrew J. Patterson. <ref>"Ushering in the era of nuclear terrorism," by Patterson, Andrew J. MD, PhD, ''Critical Care Medicine'', v. 35, p.953-954, 2007. </ref> . 

Security specialist Shaun Gregory argued in an article that terrorists have attacked Pakistani nuclear facilities three times in the recent past; twice in 2007 and once in 2008. <ref>Rhys Blakeley, "[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6792397.ece Terrorists 'have attacked Pakistan nuclear sites three times']," ''Times Online'' (August 11, 2009). </ref> . 

==Pakistan==. 
After several incidents in [[Pakistan]] in which terrorists attacked three of its military nuclear facilities it became clear that there emerged a serious danger that they would gain access to the country’s nuclear arsenal, according to a journal published by the US Military Academy at [[West Point]]. <ref>{{citation |first=Rhys |last=Blakely|title=Terrorists 'have attacked Pakistan nuclear sites three times' |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6792397.ece |work=[[Times Online]] |date=August 11, 2009 | location=London}}</ref> In January 2010 it was revealed that the US army was training a specialised unit ''"to seal off and snatch back"'' Pakistani nuclear weapons in the event that militants would obtain a nuclear device or materials that could make one. Pakistan supposedly possesses about 80 nuclear warheads. US officials refused to speak on the record about the American safety plans. <ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6991056.ece "Elite US troops ready to combat Pakistani nuclear hijacks"]</ref> . 

A study by [[Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs]] at [[Harvard University]] titled 'Securing the Bomb 2010', found that Pakistan's stockpile "faces a greater threat from Islamic extremists seeking nuclear weapons than any other nuclear stockpile on earth". <ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/apr/12/pakistan-nuclear-weapons-security-fears Pakistan nuclear weapons at risk of theft by terrorists, US study warns], [[The Guardian]], 2010-04-12</ref> . 

According to Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a former investigator with the CIA and the US Department of Energy, there is "a greater possibility of a nuclear meltdown in Pakistan than anywhere else in the world. The region has more violent extremists than any other, the country is unstable, and its arsenal of nuclear weapons is expanding."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8615484.stm Could terrorists get hold of a nuclear bomb?], [[BBC]], 2010-04-12</ref> . 

Nuclear weapons expert [[David Albright]] author of 'Peddling Peril' has also expressed concerns that Pakistan's stockpile may not be secure despite assurances by both Pakistan and U.S. government.  He stated Pakistan "has had many leaks from its program of classified information and sensitive nuclear equipment, and so you have to worry that it could be acquired in Pakistan," <ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/04/13/nuclear.terrorists/ Official: Terrorists seek nuclear material, but lack ability to use it], [[CNN]], 2010-04-13</ref> . 

A 2010 study by the [[Congressional Research Service]] titled 'Pakistan’s Nuclear Weapons: Proliferation and Security Issues' noted that even though Pakistan had taken several steps to enhance Nuclear security in recent years 'Instability in Pakistan has called the extent and durability of these reforms into question.'<ref>[http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/RL34248.pdf Pakistan’s Nuclear Weapons: Proliferation and Security Issues], [[Congressional Research Service]], 2010-02-23</ref> . 

==United States==. 
President [[Barack Obama]] has reviewed Homeland Security policy and concluded that "attacks using improvised nuclear devices ... pose a serious and increasing national security risk". <ref name="ob">The White House. [http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/homeland-security/ Homeland Security]</ref> In their presidential contest, President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry both agreed that the most serious danger facing the United States is the possibility that terrorists could obtain a nuclear bomb. <ref name="Bunn" /> Most nuclear-weapon analysts agree that "building such a device would pose few technological challenges to reasonably competent terrorists". The main barrier is acquiring highly [[Enriched uranium]]. <ref>Charles D. Ferguson.

Detonation of a nuclear weapon in a major U.S. city could kill more than 500,000 people and cause more than a trillion dollars in damage. <ref name="kittrie" /><ref name="nyt" /> Hundreds of thousands could die from fallout, the resulting fires and collapsing buildings. In this scenario, uncontrolled fires would burn for days and emergency services and hospitals would be completely overwhelmed. <ref name="Bunn" /><ref>[http://www.nti.org/e_research/cnwm/cnwm_chapter2.pdf Controlling Nuclear Warheads and Materials] p. 16. </ref><ref>Bleek, Philipp, Anders Corr, and Micah Zenko.

The Obama administration will focus on reducing the risk of high-consequence, non-traditional nuclear threats. Nuclear security is to be strengthened by enhancing "nuclear detection architecture and ensuring that our own nuclear materials are secure", and by "establishing well-planned, well-rehearsed, plans for co-ordinated response". <ref name="ob" /> According to senior Pentagon officials, the United States will make "thwarting nuclear-armed terrorists a central aim of American strategic nuclear planning". <ref>Thom Shanker and Eric Scmitt. [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/19/us/politics/19nuke.html U.S. to Make Stopping Nuclear Terror Key Aim] ''The New York Times'', December 18, 2009. </ref> [[Nuclear attribution]] is another strategy being pursued to counter terrorism. Led by the National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center, attribution would allow the government to determine the likely source of nuclear material used in the event of a nuclear attack. This would prevent terrorist groups, and any states willing to help them, from being able to pull off a covert attack without assurance of retaliation. <ref>{{cite web|last=Richelson|first=Jeffrey|title=U.S. Nuclear Detection and Counterterrorism, 1998-2009|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb270/index.htm|publisher=George Washington University}}</ref> . 

In July 2010 medical personnel from the U.S. Army practiced the techniques they would use to treat people injured by an atomic blast. The exercises were carried out at a training center in Indiana, and were set up to "simulate the aftermath of a small nuclear bomb blast, set off in a U.S. city by terrorists". <ref>Deborah Block. [http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/usa/US-Military-Practices-for-Nuclear-Attack-99269609.html US Military Practices Medical Response to Nuclear Attack] ''Voice of America'', 26 July 2010. </ref> . 

==Recovering lost weapons and material==. 
In August 2002, the United States launched a program to track and secure [[enriched uranium]] from 24 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-style reactors in 16 countries, in order to reduce the risk of the materials falling into the hands of terrorists or "[[rogue state]]s". The first such operation was ''[[Project Vinca]]'', "a multinational, public-private effort to remove nuclear material from a poorly-secured [[Vinca Nuclear Institute|Yugoslav research institute]]."  The project has been hailed as "a nonproliferation success story" with the "potential to inform broader 'global cleanout' efforts to address one of the weakest links in the nuclear nonproliferation chain: insufficiently secured civilian nuclear research facilities."<ref>Philipp C. Bleek, "Project Vinca: Lessons for Securing Civil Nuclear Material Stockpiles," ''The Nonproliferation Review'' (Fall-Winter 2003) p. 1. </ref> . 

In order to reduce the danger of attacks using [[nuclear waste]] material, [[European Union]] Commissioner [[Loyola de Palacio]] suggested in November 2002 the creation of common standards in the European Union, especially in the new member states operating Soviet-era reactors, for subterranean nuclear waste disposal.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} . 

In November 2007, burglars with unknown intentions infiltrated the [[Pelindaba]] nuclear research facility near Pretoria, South Africa. The burglars escaped without acquiring any of the uranium held at the facility. <ref>http://www.pretorianews.co.za/?fSectionId=&fArticleId=vn20071109061218448C528585</ref><ref>Washington Post, December 20, 2007, Op-Ed by Micah Zenko</ref> .
