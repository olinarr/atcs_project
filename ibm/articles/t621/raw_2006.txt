A '''neutron bomb''' or ''enhanced radiation weapon'' (ERW) or ''weapon of reinforced radiation'' is a type of [[thermonuclear weapon]] designed specifically to release a large portion of its [[energy]] as energetic [[neutron radiation]] rather than [[TNT equivalent|explosive energy]].  Although their extreme blast and heat effects are not eliminated, it is the enormous radiation released by ERWs that is meant to be a major source of casualties. The levels of neutron radiation released are able to penetrate through thick, protective materials such as [[armor]], making them useful as an anti-tank weapon. <ref>{{cite book|author=Barriot, Patrick|chapter=Nuclear and radiological weapons|editors=Barriot, Patrick & Bismuth, Chantal|title=Treating victims of weapons of mass destruction: medical, legal, and strategic aspects|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2008|isbn=978-0-470-06646-1|page=180|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GgUFmDMazl0C&pg=PA180}}</ref> . 

==Detailed description==. 
A neutron bomb is a [[Teller-Ulam design|fission-fusion]] thermonuclear weapon (hydrogen bomb) in which the burst of [[free neutron|neutrons]] generated by a [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] reaction is intentionally allowed to escape the weapon, rather than being absorbed by its other components. The weapon's [[X-ray]] mirrors and radiation case, made of [[uranium]] or [[lead]] in a standard bomb, are instead made of [[chromium]] or [[nickel]] so that the neutrons can escape.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The bombs also require amounts of [[tritium]] on the order of a few tens of grams. <ref>{{cite book|author=Kalinowski, Martin|title=International control of tritium for nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament|publisher=CRC Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-415-31615-6|page=10|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YThIeCSxVZ4C&pg=PA10}}</ref> . 

The "usual" [[nuclear weapon yield]]—expressed as kT [[TNT equivalent]]—is not a measure of a neutron weapon's destructive power. It refers only to the energy released (mostly heat and blast), and does not express the lethal effect of neutron radiation on living organisms. Compared to a fission bomb with the identical explosive yield, a neutron bomb would emit about ten times<ref name=Kistiakovsky>{{cite journal|last=Kistiakovsky|first=George|title=The folly of the neutron bomb|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|date=Sep 1978|volume=34|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aAoAAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA27&dq=8000%20rads%20of%20fast%20neutron%20radiation%20(from%20a%20neutron%20bomb)&pg=PA27#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=11 February 2011|page=27}}</ref> the amount of neutron radiation. In a fission bomb, radiation pulse energy is approximately 5% of entire energy released; in the neutron bomb it would be closer to 50%.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Neutron bombs release a much higher amount of neutrons than a fission bomb of the same explosive yield. Furthermore, these neutrons are of much higher energy (14 MeV) than those released during a fission reaction (1-2 MeV). <ref>{{cite book|author=Hafemeister, David W.|title=Physics of societal issues: calculations on national security, environment, and energy|publisher=Springer|year=2007|isbn=978-0-387-95560-5|page=18|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LT4MSqv9QUIC&pg=PA18}}</ref> . 

==History==. 
Conception of the neutron bomb is generally credited to [[Samuel T. Cohen]] of the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], who developed the concept in 1958. <ref>{{cite news |author=[[Robert D. McFadden]] |coauthors= |title=Samuel T.

D</ref> Development was subsequently postponed by President [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1978 following protests against his administration's plans to deploy neutron warheads in Europe. President [[Ronald Reagan]] restarted production in 1981. <ref>{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=On this Day: 7 April |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/7/newsid_2523000/2523051.stm  |quote=Jimmy Carter's successor, Ronald Reagan, changed US policy and gave the order for the production of neutron warheads to start in 1981. ... |work=[[BBC]] |date= 1978-04-07|accessdate=2010-07-02 }}</ref> . 

Three types of ERW were built by the United States. <ref>[http://www.omnology.com/nuclear01.html Nuclear Weapon News and Background<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The [[W66]] warhead, for the anti-ICBM [[Sprint (missile)|Sprint]] missile system, was deployed in 1975 and retired the next year, along with the missile system. The [[W70|W70 Mod 3]] warhead was developed for the short-range, tactical [[MGM-52 Lance|Lance missile]], and the [[W79|W79 Mod 0]] was developed for artillery shells. The latter two types were retired by President [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1992, following the end of the [[Cold War]]. <ref>{{cite news |author=[[Christopher Ruddy]] |coauthors= |title=Bomb inventor says U.S. defenses suffer because of politics |url=http://www.manuelsweb.com/sam_cohen.htm |quote=With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of communism as we knew it, the Bush administration moved to dismantle all of our tactical nuclear weapons, including the Reagan stockpile of neutron bombs. In Cohen's mind, America was brought back to Square One. Without tactical weapons like the neutron bomb, America would be left with two choices if an enemy was winning a conventional war: surrender, or unleash the holocaust of strategic nuclear weapons. |work=[[Tribune-Review]] |date=June 15, 1997 |accessdate=2010-07-03 }}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq1.html Types of Nuclear Weapons]</ref> The last [[W70|W70 Mod 3]] warhead was dismantled in 1996,<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/congress/1996_h/hs960312-13t.htm#ToCsec24 March 13, 1996<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and the last W79 Mod 0 was dismantled by 2003, when the dismantling of all W79 variants was completed. <ref>[http://www.nnsa.doe.gov/docs/newsreleases/2003/PR_NA-03-16_W-76Dismantled-LastNuclearArtilleryShell(12-03).pdf National Nuclear Security Administration - Homepage<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . 

Besides the United States and Soviet Union, France and China are understood to have tested neutron or enhanced radiation bombs in the past, with France apparently leading the field with an early test of the technology in 1967<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/395689.stm BBC News: Neutron bomb: Why 'clean' is deadly]</ref> and an "actual" neutron bomb in 1980. <ref>UK parliamentary question on whether condemnation was considered by Thatcher government [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1980/jul/16/french-neutron-bomb]</ref> The 1999 [[Cox Report]] indicates that China is able to produce neutron bombs,<ref>U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People's Republic of China [http://www.house.gov/coxreport/]</ref> although no country is currently known to deploy them.  . 

Considerable controversy arose in the U.S. and Western Europe, following a June 1977 [[Washington Post]] exposé describing U.S. government plans to purchase the bomb. The article focused on the fact that it was the first weapon specifically intended to kill humans with radiation. <ref>{{cite book|author=Wittner, Lawrence S.|title=Confronting the bomb: a short history of the world nuclear disarmament movement|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-8047-5632-7|pages=132–133|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_fC7lAg5ZU0C&pg=PA132}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Auten, Brian J.|title=Carter's conversion: the hardening of American defense policy|publisher=University of Missouri Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8262-1816-2|page=134|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=asmyUHd3_oQC&pg=PA134}}</ref> [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] director [[Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)|Harold Brown]] and Soviet General Secretary [[Leonid Brezhnev]] both described the neutron bomb as a "capitalist bomb", because it was designed to destroy people while preserving property. <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=7TshAQAAIAAJ&dq=national+security+for+a+new+era+snow&q=the+capitalist+bomb#search_anchor National security for a new era: globalization and geopolitics after Iraq], Donald Snow</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author=Herken, Greff|title=Brotherhood of the Bomb: The Tangled Lives and Loyalties of Robert Oppenheimer, Ernest Lawrence, and Edward Teller|publisher=Macmillan|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8050-6589-3|page=332|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7s0NGIfflOgC&pg=PA332}}</ref> . 

==Use of neutron bomb==. 
Neutron bombs are purposely designed with explosive yields lower than other nuclear weapons.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} This is because neutrons are absorbed by air{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}, so a high-yield neutron bomb is not able to radiate neutrons beyond its blast range and so would have no destructive advantage over a normal hydrogen bomb. This intense [[Pulse (physics)|pulse]] of high-energy neutrons is intended as the principal killing mechanism, not the fallout, heat or blast. Although neutron bombs are commonly believed to "leave the infrastructure intact", current designs have explosive yields in the kiloton range,<ref>[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons/Allbombs.html List of All U.S. Nuclear Weapons]</ref> the detonation of which would cause considerable destruction through blast and heat effects.  . 

Neutron bombs could be used as strategic [[anti-ballistic missile]] weapons or as tactical weapons intended for use against armored forces.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The neutron bomb was originally conceived by the U.S. military as a weapon that could stop [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops from overrunning allied nations without destroying the infrastructure of the allied nation. <ref>{{cite book|author=Muller, Richard A.|title=Physics for Future Presidents: The Science Behind the Headlines|publisher=W.W. Norton & Company|year=2009|isbn=978-0-393-33711-2|page=148|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6DBnS2g-KrQC&pg=PA148}}</ref> . 

===Use against armor===. 
One of the uses for which this weapon was conceived is large-scale [[Anti-tank warfare|anti-tank weaponry]]. [[Armored fighting vehicle]]s offer a relatively high degree of protection against heat and blast, the primary destructive mechanisms of normal nuclear weapons. That is, military personnel inside a tank can be expected to survive an "ordinary" nuclear explosion at relatively close range, while the vehicle's [[Weapons of mass destruction|nuclear/biological/chemical]] protection systems ensure a high degree of operability even in a [[nuclear fallout]] environment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} . 

ER weapons are meant to kill a much higher percentage of enemy personnel inside such protected environments through the release of a higher percentage of their yield in the form of neutron [[ionizing radiation]], against which tank armors, excluding [[depleted uranium]], are ineffective.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} . 

===Questionable effectiveness in modern anti-tank role===. 
The questionable effectiveness of ER weapons against modern [[tank]]s is cited as one of the main reasons why these weapons are no longer fielded or [[Nuclear stockpile|stockpiled]]. With the increase in average tank [[armor]] thickness since the first ER weapons were fielded, tank armor protection approaches the level where tank crews are now almost completely protected from radiation effects. Therefore for an ER weapon to incapacitate a modern tank crew through irradiation,<ref>http://collinsj.tripod.com/protect.htm average tank armor thickness increase</ref> the weapon must now be detonated at such a close proximity to the tank that the [[nuclear explosion]]'s blast would now be equally effective at incapacitating it and its crew. <ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=mYVNkaEJpz4C&pg=PA47&dq=%22main+battle+tank%22&hl=en&ei=aUEyTrr0Gun_sQL0i8HmCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAzgo#v=onepage&q=%22main%20battle%20tank%22&f=false New Scientist March 13 1986 pg 45</ref> . 

===Use against ballistic missiles===. 
As an anti-ballistic missile weapon, an ER warhead was developed for the [[Sprint (missile)|Sprint]] missile system as part of the [[Safeguard Program]] to protect United States cities and [[missile silo]]s from incoming [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] warheads by damaging their electronic components with the intense [[neutron flux]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} .
