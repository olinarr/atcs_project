'''Nuclear holocaust''' refers to the possibility of the near complete annihilation of human [[civilization]] by [[nuclear warfare]]. Under such a scenario, all or most of the Earth is made uninhabitable by [[nuclear weapon]]s in future [[world war]]s.  . 

A common definition of the word "holocaust":   "great destruction resulting in the extensive loss of life, especially by fire."<ref name="AmHeritage">[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/holocaust American Heritage Dictionary definition of "holocaust"]</ref>  The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] term "holokaustos" meaning "completely burnt."  Possibly the first printed use of the word "holocaust" to describe an imagined nuclear destruction is Reginald Glossop's 1926: "Moscow ... beneath them  ... a crash like a crack of Doom! The echoes of this Holocaust rumbled and rolled ... a distinct smell of sulphur ... atomic destruction."<ref>Reginald Glossop, The Orphan of Space (London: G. MacDonald, 1926) -- p 303 for the words quoted prior to "atomic destruction"; "atomic destruction" is on p. 306. The atomic weapon of the book is planted in the office of the Soviet dictator who, with German help and Chinese mercenaries, is preparing the takeover of Western Europe -- a strangely prescient book, biological warfare, cellular phones, a version of the [[Gaia hypothesis]], and an atomic weapon. </ref>  In the 1960s the principal referent of the unmodified "holocaust" was nuclear destruction. <ref>See in http://www.berkeleyinternet.com/holocaust/ the paragraph preceding footnote 38</ref>  Since the mid 1970s the capitalized term "Holocaust" has been closely associated with the [[Nazi]] mass slaughter of [[Jews]] (see [[The Holocaust]]) and "holocaust" in its nuclear destruction sense is almost always preceded by "atomic" or "nuclear". <ref>President Bush in August 2007: “Iran’s pursuit of technology that could lead to nuclear weapons threatens to put a region already known for instability and violence under the shadow of a nuclear holocaust." http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article2343791.ece -- The headline of the article: Bush ... Iran bomb ... warning of 'holocaust'. For the 1970s increasing employment of "Holocaust" in the sense of mass murder of Jews see http://www.berkeleyinternet.com/holocaust/#Post1965</ref> . 

Nuclear physicists and [[speculative fiction|authors]] have speculated that nuclear holocaust could result in an end to human life, or at least to modern civilization on Earth due to the immediate effects of [[nuclear fallout]], the loss of much modern technology due to [[electromagnetic pulse]]s, or [[nuclear winter]] and resulting [[extinction]]s.  . 

Since 1947 the [[Doomsday Clock]] of the [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] visualizes how far the world is from a nuclear holocaust.  .
