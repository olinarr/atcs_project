The '''nuclear weapons debate''' is about public controversies relating to the use and stockpiling of [[nuclear weapons]]. Even before the first nuclear weapons had been developed, scientists involved with the [[Manhattan Project]] were divided over the use of the weapon. The [[Little Boy]] atomic bomb was detonated over the [[Japan]]ese city of [[Hiroshima]] on 6 August 1945. The role of the bombings in [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]] and the U.S.'s [[ethics|ethical]] justification for them has been the subject of scholarly and popular debate for decades.  . 

[[Nuclear disarmament]] refers to both the act of reducing or eliminating nuclear weapons and to the end state of a nuclear-free world, in which nuclear weapons are completely eliminated. Proponents of nuclear disarmament say that it would lessen the probability of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] occurring, especially accidentally. Critics of nuclear disarmament say that it would undermine [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]].  . 

Various American government officials, who were in office during the [[Cold War]] period, are now advocating the elimination of [[nuclear weapon]]s. These officials include [[Henry Kissinger]], [[George Shultz]], [[Sam Nunn]], and [[William Perry]]. In January 2010, [[Lawrence M. Krauss]] stated that "no issue carries more importance to the long-term health and security of humanity than the effort to reduce, and perhaps one day, rid the world of nuclear weapons". <ref>Lawrence M.

==History==. 
[[Image:Nagasakibomb.jpg|thumb|The [[Fat Man]] [[mushroom cloud]] resulting from the [[nuclear explosion]] over [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]].]]
Even before the first nuclear weapons had been developed, scientists involved with the [[Manhattan Project]] were divided over the use of the weapon. Some—notably a number at the [[University of Chicago]] [[Metallurgical Laboratory]], represented in part by [[Leó Szilárd]]—lobbied early on that the atomic bomb should only be built as a [[deterrent]] against Nazi Germany getting a bomb, and should not be used against populated cities. The [[Franck Report]] argued in June 1945 that instead of being used against a city, the first atomic bomb should be "demonstrated" to the Japanese on an uninhabited area. <ref>{{cite web | last = Schollmeyer | first = Josh | title = ''Minority Report'' | publisher = ''[http://www.thebulletin.org "Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists"]'' | date = January/February 2005 | url = http://thebulletin.metapress.com/content/c44g1634464675j7/?p=b09a34e5df624f6ba81f091a260ea38f&pi=9 | accessdate = 2009-08-04 }}</ref> This recommendation was not agreed with by the military commanders, the Los Alamos Target Committee (made up of other scientists), or the politicians who had input into the use of the weapon. Because the Manhattan Project was considered to be "[[top secret]]", there was no public discussion of the use of nuclear arms, and even within the U.S. government, knowledge of the bomb was extremely limited.  . 

The [[Little Boy]] atomic bomb was detonated over the [[Japan]]ese city of [[Hiroshima]] on 6 August 1945. Exploding with a yield equivalent to 12,500&nbsp;tonnes of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]], the blast and thermal wave of the bomb destroyed nearly 50,000 buildings and killed approximately 75,000 people. <ref>{{Cite book |year=2001 |chapter=Uranium |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=j-Xu07p3cKwC&printsec=frontcover |title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A to Z Guide to the Elements |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford]] |isbn=0-19-850340-7 |authorlink=John Emsley |first=John |last=Emsley |pages=478 }}</ref> Detonation of the "[[Fat Man]]" atomic bomb over [[Nagasaki]] occurred on 9 August 1945. The role of the bombings in [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]] and the U.S.'s [[ethics|ethical]] justification for them has been the subject of scholarly and popular debate for decades. J. Samuel Walker suggests that "the controversy over the use of the bomb seems certain to continue". <ref name=Walker> {{cite journal |title=Recent Literature on Truman's Atomic Bomb Decision: A Search for Middle Ground |journal=Diplomatic History|year= 2005 |month=April |first=J.

Countries known to have detonated nuclear weapons—and that acknowledge possessing such weapons—are (chronologically) the [[United States and weapons of mass destruction|United States]], the [[Soviet Union]] (succeeded as a nuclear power by [[Russia and weapons of mass destruction|Russia]]), the [[United Kingdom and weapons of mass destruction|United Kingdom]], [[France and weapons of mass destruction|France]], the [[People's Republic of China and weapons of mass destruction|People's Republic of China]], [[India and weapons of mass destruction|India]], [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|Pakistan]], and [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|North Korea]]. <ref name="nuclearweapons1">{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/programs/ssp/nukes/nuclearweapons/nukestatus.html |title=Federation of American Scientists: Status of World Nuclear Forces |publisher=Fas.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-12}}</ref> . 

==Arguments==. 
[[Nuclear disarmament]] refers to both the act of reducing or eliminating nuclear weapons and to the end state of a nuclear-free world, in which nuclear weapons are completely eliminated. Proponents of nuclear disarmament say that it would lessen the probability of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] occurring, especially accidentally. In the early 1980s, following a revival of the [[nuclear arms race]], a popular [[Anti-nuclear movement|nuclear disarmament movement]] emerged. <ref>Lawrence S. Wittner.  [http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/op-eds/disarmament-movement-lessons-yesteryear Disarmament movement lessons from yesteryear] ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'', 27 July 2009. </ref> In October 1981 half a million people took to the streets in several cities in Italy, more than 250,000 people protested in Bonn, 250,000 demonstrated in London, and 100,000 marched in Brussels. <ref>David Cortright (2008). ''Peace: A History of Movements and Ideas'', Cambridge University Press, p. 147. </ref> The largest anti-nuclear protest was held on June 12, 1982, when one million people demonstrated in [[New York City]] against [[nuclear weapons]]. <ref>Jonathan Schell.

''Peace: A History of Movements and Ideas'', Cambridge University Press, p. 148. </ref> . 

Critics of nuclear disarmament say that it would undermine [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]]. Deterrence is a strategy by which governments threaten an immense retaliation if attacked, such that aggressors are deterred if they do not wish to suffer great damage as a result of an aggressive action. Nuclear weapons are said to have induced "[[nuclear peace]]" during the [[Cold War]], when both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. possessed mutual second-strike retaliation capability, eliminating the possibility of nuclear victory for either side.  . 

Various American government officials, who were in office during the [[Cold War]] period, are now advocating the elimination of [[nuclear weapon]]s. These officials include [[Henry Kissinger]], [[George Shultz]], [[Sam Nunn]], and [[William Perry]]. <ref name=shul/> They believe that the doctrine of mutual Soviet-American deterrence is obsolete, and that reliance on nuclear weapons for deterrence is becoming increasingly hazardous and decreasingly effective. <ref name=shul>George P. Shultz, William J. Perry, [[Henry A. Kissinger]] and Sam Nunn.  [http://www.fcnl.org/issues/item.php?item_id=2252&issue_id=54 A World Free of Nuclear Weapons] ''Wall Street Journal'', January 4, 2007, page A15. </ref><ref name=globalzero>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18836134 |title=Nuclear endgame: The growing appeal of zero |author= |date=June 16, 2011 |work=The Economist }}</ref>  
<blockquote>
The risk of accidents, misjudgments or unauthorised launches, they argued, was growing more acute in a world of rivalries between relatively new nuclear states that lacked the security safeguards developed over many years by America and the Soviet Union. The emergence of pariah states, such as North Korea (possibly soon to be joined by Iran), armed with nuclear weapons was adding to the fear as was the declared ambition of terrorists to steal, buy or build a nuclear device. Only by a concerted effort to free the world of nuclear weapons could the terrifying trend be reversed. <ref name=globalzero/>

Some scientists estimate that a war between two countries that resulted in 100 Hiroshima-size atomic explosions would cause significant loss of life, in the tens of millions. There would also be much soot thrown up into the atmosphere which would blanket the earth, causing the disruption of food chains. <ref>Philip Yam. Nuclear Exchange, ''Scientific American'', June 2010, p. 24. </ref><ref>Alan Robock and Owen Brian Toon. Local Nuclear War, Global Suffering, ''Scientific American'', January 2010, p. 74-81. </ref> . 

==Recent developments==. 
In recent years there have been concerns about North Korea's nuclear tests and Iran's refusal to stop its program to enrich uranium, potentially to weapons grade. The world is now in a new and dangerous nuclear era, and the likelihood that non-state terrorists will get their hands on nuclear weaponry is increasing. Nuclear weapons deployed by terrorists would be  the ultimate means of mass devastation. And non-state terrorist groups with nuclear weapons are "conceptually outside the bounds of a deterrent strategy and present difficult new security challenges". <ref name=shul/> . 

In January 2010, [[Lawrence M. Krauss]] stated that "no issue carries more importance to the long-term health and security of humanity than the effort to reduce, and perhaps one day, rid the world of nuclear weapons". <ref>Lawrence M. Krauss. The Doomsday Clock Still Ticks, ''Scientific American'', January 2010, p. 26. </ref> .
