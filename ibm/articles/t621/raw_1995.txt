A '''strategic nuclear weapon''' refers to a [[nuclear weapon]] which is designed to be used on targets as part of a strategic plan, such as nuclear [[missile]] bases, military [[command center]]s and heavily populated civilian areas such as large towns and cities.  . 

They are in contrast to [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, which are designed for use in battle, as part of an attack with conventional forces. Strategic nuclear weapons generally have significantly larger yields, starting from 100 [[kiloton]]s up to destructive yields in the low megaton range. However, yields can overlap, and many weapons such as the [[B61 nuclear bomb]] are used in both tactical and strategic roles. Indeed, the strategic [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] attacks utilized weapons of between 10 and 20 kilotons, though this was because the "[[Little Boy]]" and "[[Fat Man]]" bombs were the most destructive (and indeed only) nuclear weapons available at the time.  . 

A feature of strategic nuclear weapons is the greater range of their delivery apparatus (e.g. ICBMs), giving them the ability to threaten the enemy's [[command and control]] structure, even though they are based many thousands of miles away in friendly territory. [[Intercontinental ballistic missile]]s with nuclear warheads are the primary strategic nuclear weapons, while short-range missiles are tactical. In addition, while tactical weapons are designed to meet battlefield objectives, the main purpose of strategic weapons is in the deterrence role, under the theory of [[mutually assured destruction]].  .
