'''Castle Bravo''' was the [[code name]] given to the first [[United States|U.S.]] test of a dry fuel [[Nuclear fusion|thermonuclear]] [[hydrogen bomb]] device, detonated on March 1, 1954 at [[Bikini Atoll]], [[Marshall Islands]], as the first test of [[Operation Castle]].  Castle Bravo was the most powerful [[nuclear weapon|nuclear device]] ever detonated by the [[United States]] (and just under one-third the energy of the [[Tsar Bomba|most powerful]] ever detonated), with a yield of 15 [[TNT equivalent|megatons]].  That yield, far exceeding the expected yield of 4 to 6 megatons, combined with other factors, led to the most significant accidental [[radioactive contamination|radiological contamination]] ever caused by the United States.  [[Nuclear fallout|Fallout]] from the detonation — intended to be a secret test — poisoned the islanders who had previously inhabited the atoll and returned there afterwards,<ref name=ghostfleet>The Ghost Fleet of Bikini Atoll, Military History Channel, air date 9 August 2010 http://www.militaryhistory.co.uk/shows/ghost-fleet-bikini-atoll/about.html</ref> as well as the crew of ''[[Daigo Fukuryū Maru]]'' ("Lucky Dragon No. 5"), a Japanese fishing boat, and created international concern about atmospheric thermonuclear testing. <ref>John Bellamy Foster (2009).

==Test location==. 
The device was a very large cylinder weighing 23,500 pounds (10.7 [[tonnes]]) and measuring 179.5 inches (4.56&nbsp;m) in length and 53.9&nbsp;inches (1.37&nbsp;m) in width.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} It was mounted in a "shot cab" on an artificial island built on a reef off Namu Island, in the [[Bikini Atoll]]. A sizable array of diagnostic instruments was trained on it, including a number of high-speed cameras which were trained through an arc of mirror towers around the shot cab.  .

The bomb used [[lithium hydride|lithium deuteride]] fuel for the [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] stage, unlike the [[cryogenic]] liquid [[deuterium]]–[[tritium]] used as fuel for the fusion stage of the U.S. experimental [[Ivy Mike]] device, which was weaponized as the [[Mark 16 nuclear bomb]]. The bomb tested at Castle Bravo was the first practical deliverable [[hydrogen bomb|fusion bomb]] in the U.S. arsenal.  . 

The device detonated for the test was named "Shrimp" and was the same basic configuration as the [[Ivy Mike]] device, except with a different type of fusion fuel. The "Shrimp" device implemented a light case design, using [[aluminum]] instead of the heavy [[steel]] case used in Mike.  . 

Inside the cylindrical case was a smaller cylinder of lithium deuteride fusion fuel (the secondary) with a [[nuclear fission|fission]] [[atomic bomb]] (the primary) at one end, the latter employed to create the conditions needed to start the fusion reaction. Running down the center of the secondary, was a cylindrical rod of [[plutonium]] (the sparkplug), which was used to ignite the fusion reaction. Surrounding this assembly was a natural [[uranium]] tamper. The space between the tamper and the case formed a [[radiation]] channel to conduct [[X-ray]]s from the primary to the secondary. The function of the X-rays was to compress the secondary (see [[Teller-Ulam design]]), increasing the density and temperature of the deuterium to the level needed to sustain a thermonuclear reaction, and compress the sparkplug to [[Critical mass (nuclear)|supercritical]] ignition. (See [[Nuclear weapon design#Light pipes|nuclear weapon design]].) . 

It was practically identical to the "Runt" device later detonated in [[Castle Romeo]], but used partially enriched [[lithium]] in the fusion fuel. Natural lithium is a mixture of lithium-6 and lithium-7 [[isotopes]] (with 7.5% of the former). The enriched lithium used in Bravo was approximately 40% lithium-6.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The primary was a standard [[RACER IV]] fusion-boosted atomic bomb.  . 

==Detonation==. 
[[Image:Castle Bravo (black and white).jpg|thumb|left|150px|The Castle Bravo [[mushroom cloud]].]]
The detonation took place at 06:45 on March 1, 1954 local time (18:45 on February 28 [[GMT]]). <ref>{{cite web| url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Tests/Castle.html| title=Nuclear Weapon Archive| accessdate=2008-03-01}}</ref> . 

When Bravo was detonated, it formed a fireball almost four and a half miles (roughly 7&nbsp;km) across within a second. This fireball was visible on [[Kwajalein]] atoll over 250 miles (450&nbsp;km) away. The explosion left a crater 6,500 feet (2,000&nbsp;m) in diameter and 250 feet (75&nbsp;m) in depth. The [[mushroom cloud]] reached a height of 47,000 feet (14&nbsp;km) and a diameter of 7 miles (11&nbsp;km) in about a minute; it then reached a height of 130,000 feet (40&nbsp;km) and 62 miles (100&nbsp;km) in diameter in less than 10 minutes and was expanding at more than 100 m/s (360 km/h, 224 mph). As a result of the blast, the cloud contaminated more than seven thousand square miles of the surrounding Pacific Ocean including some of the surrounding small islands like [[Rongerik]], [[Rongelap]] and [[Utirik]]. <ref>Titus, A. Costandina. Bombs in the backyard atomic testing and American politics. Reno: University of Nevada P, 2001. Google Books. <http://books.google.com/books?id=eQfG-U5iAPYC>. </ref> . 

In terms of [[TNT equivalent|TNT tonnage equivalence]], Castle Bravo was about 1,000 times more powerful than each of the atomic bombs which were [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped]] on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] during [[World War II]].  The largest nuclear explosion ever produced was a test conducted by the [[Soviet Union]] seven and a half years later, the ≈50&nbsp;MT [[Tsar Bomba]]. Castle Bravo is the fifth largest nuclear explosion in history, exceeded by the Soviet tests of [[Tsar Bomba]] at 50.6 MT, [[Test 219]] (24.2 MT), and two other ~20 MT Soviet tests in 1962 at [[Novaya Zemlya]].  . 

===Cause of high yield===. 
The yield of 15 megatons was two and a half times as great as expected. The cause of the high yield was a theoretical error made by designers of the device at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. They considered only the lithium-6 isotope in the lithium deuteride secondary to be reactive; the lithium-7 isotope, accounting for 60% of the lithium content,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} was assumed to be inert.  . 

It was expected that lithium-6 isotope would absorb a [[neutron]] from the fissioning plutonium and emit an [[alpha particle]] and [[tritium]] in the process, of which the latter would then fuse with the [[deuterium]] and increase the yield in a predicted manner. Lithium-6 obeyed this assumption.  . 

However, when the lithium-7 isotope is bombarded with [[neutron temperature|energetic neutrons]], it captures a neutron then decays yielding an alpha particle, a tritium [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]], and the captured neutron. This means more tritium was produced than expected, and the extra tritium is fused with deuterium. In addition to tritium formation the extra neutron released from lithium-7 decay produced a larger [[neutron flux]]. This caused more fissioning of the uranium tamper and increased yield.  . 

This resultant extra fuel (both lithium-6 and lithium-7) contributed greatly to the fusion reactions and neutron production and in this manner greatly increased the device's explosive output. The test used lithium with a high percentage of lithium-7 only because lithium-6 was then scarce and expensive; the later [[Castle Union]] test used almost pure lithium-6. Had more lithium-6 been available, the usability of the common lithium-7 might not have been discovered.  . 

===Fallout incident===. 
[[Image:Bravo fallout2.png|right|thumb|300px|The ''Bravo'' fallout plume spread dangerous levels of radiation over an area over {{convert|100|mi|km}} long, including inhabited islands.]]
The fission reactions of the natural uranium tamper were quite dirty, producing a large amount of [[nuclear fallout|fallout]]. That, combined with the much-larger-than-expected yield and a major wind shift, produced a number of very serious consequences.  In the de-classified film "Operation Castle", task force commander General Clarkson points to a diagram indicating that the wind shift was still in the range of "acceptable fallout", although just barely.  . 

The decision to fire the Bravo bomb under the prevailing winds was made by Dr. [[Alvin C. Graves]] (1909–1966), the Scientific Director of Operation Castle. Dr. Graves had total authority over firing the weapon, above that of the military Commander of Operation Castle. Dr. Graves had himself received an exposure of 400 [[röntgen]]s in the [[Louis_Slotin#The_criticality_accident|1946 Los Alamos accident]] in which his personal friend, Dr. [[Louis Slotin]], died from radiation exposure. Dr. Graves appears in the widely available film of the earlier 1952 test "Ivy Mike", which examines the last-minute fallout decisions. The narrator, Western actor [[Reed Hadley]], is filmed aboard the control ship in that film, showing the final conference. Hadley points out that 20,000 people live in the potential area of the fallout. He asks the control panel scientist if the test can be aborted and is told "yes", but it would ruin all their preparations in setting up timed measuring instruments in the race against the Russians. In Mike the fallout correctly landed north of the inhabited area but, in the 1954 Bravo test, there was a lot of [[wind shear]], and the wind that was blowing north the day before the test steadily veered towards the east.  . 

[[Radioactive]] fallout was spread eastward onto the inhabited [[Rongelap Atoll|Rongelap]] and [[Rongerik Atoll|Rongerik]] atolls, which were tardily evacuated. <ref>http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2009/06/22/les-cobayes-du-dr-folamour_1209927_3244.html</ref> Subsequently many<!-- a number would be even better --> Marshall Islands natives suffered from [[birth defect]]s and received compensation from the U.S. Federal government. A medical study, named [[Project 4.1]], studied the effects of the fallout on the islanders. <ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.rmiembassyus.org/Nuclear%20Issues.htm| title=Nuclear Issues| accessdate=2006-03-26}}</ref> .

'''B'''=original "danger zone" around Bikini announced by the U.S. government. '''W'''="danger zone" extended later. '''xF'''=position of the ''Lucky Dragon'' fishing boat. '''NE, EC, and SE'''&nbsp;are equatorial currents.]] . 

Although the atmospheric fallout plume drifted eastward, once fallout landed in the water it was carried in several directions by ocean currents, including northwest and southwest. <ref>S. Sevitt, "The Bombs," ''The Lancet'', July 23, 1955, pp. 199-201. </ref> . 

A [[Japan]]ese fishing boat, ''[[Daigo Fukuryu Maru]]'', came in direct contact with the fallout, which caused many of the crew to grow ill; one eventually died. This resulted in an international uproar and reignited Japanese concerns about radiation, especially in regard that Japanese citizens were [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|once more]] adversely affected by U.S. nuclear weapons. The official U.S. line had been that the growth in the strength of atomic bombs was not accompanied by an equivalent growth in radiation released.  Japanese scientists who had collected data from the fishing vessel disagreed with this. [[Sir Joseph Rotblat]], working at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]], London, demonstrated that the contamination caused by the [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]] from the test was far greater than that stated officially. Rotblat was able to deduce that the bomb had three stages and showed that the fission phase at the end of the explosion increased the amount of radioactivity a thousandfold.  Rotblat's paper was taken up by the media, and the outcry in Japan reached such a level that diplomatic relations became strained and the incident was even dubbed by some as "a second Hiroshima". <ref name="honoluluweekly">{{cite web |date=February 25, 2004|url = http://www.honoluluweekly.com/archives/coverstory%202004/2-25-04%20Bravo%20shot/Bravo%20shot.html|title = Shot in the Dark|publisher = [[Honolulu Weekly]]| accessdate = 2008-11-30 | last=Beverly Deepe Keever |quote=The Japanese government and people dubbed it “a second Hiroshima” and it nearly led to severing diplomatic relations.}}</ref>  Nevertheless, the Japanese and U.S. governments quickly reached a political settlement, which gave the fishery a compensation of 2 million dollars with the surviving victims receiving about {{¥|}} 2 million each ($5,550 in 1954, US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5550|1954|r=-2}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}<ref name="inflation">In 25 April 1949 the US dollar was pegged to the YEN at $USD 1 = 360 YEN</ref>). <ref name="chugoku">{{cite web |date=February 29, 2004|url = http://www.chugoku-np.co.jp/abom/04e/kyodo/Ak04022901.html|title = Bikini Atoll H-bomb damaged fisheries, created prejudice|publisher = chugoku| accessdate = 2008-11-30 | last=Keiji Hirano |quote=}}</ref> It was also agreed that the victims would not be given [[Hibakusha]] status.  . 

Unanticipated fallout and radiation also affected many of the vessels and personnel involved in the test, in some cases trapping them in bunkers. One prominent scientist later recalled that he was on a ship {{convert|30|mi|km}} away, and received 10 röntgen of radiation as a result.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Sixteen crew members of the [[aircraft carrier]] [[USS Bairoko (CVE-115)|USS ''Bairoko'']] received [[beta burn]]s and there was an increased cancer rate. [[Radioactive contamination]] also affected many of the testing facilities built on other islands of the Bikini atoll system.  . 

The fallout spread traces of radioactive material as far as Australia, India and Japan, and even the United States and parts of Europe. Though organized as a secret test, Castle Bravo quickly became an international incident, prompting calls for a ban on the atmospheric testing of thermonuclear devices. <ref>DeGroot 2004, pp. 196-198</ref> . 

In addition to the radiological accident, the unexpectedly high yield of the device severely damaged many of the permanent buildings on the control site island on the far side of the atoll.  Little of the desired diagnostic data on the shot was collected; many instruments designed to transmit their data back before being destroyed by the blast were instead vaporized instantly, while most of the instruments that were expected to be recovered for data retrieval were destroyed by the blast.  . 

As a result, [[Nevil Shute]] wrote the novel ''[[On the Beach (novel)|On the Beach]]'', which alarmed the public and sparked public awareness and fear. The novel is about a war that released so much radioactive fallout that all the life in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] disappeared, while the [[Southern Hemisphere]] awaited a similar fate. The American magazine [[Consumer Reports]] warned of the contamination of milk with the radioactive isotope [[strontium-90]], which also alarmed the public. <ref>Nash, Gary B., Julie Roy Jeffrey, John R. Howe, Peter J. Frederick, Allen F. Davis, Allan M. Winkler, Charlene Mires, and Carla Gardina Pestana. The American People, Concise Edition Creating a Nation and a Society, Combined Volume (6th Edition). New York: Longman, 2007. </ref> . 

The fallout also affected islanders who had previously inhabited the atoll, and who returned there some time after the tests.  This was found to be due to the presence of radioactive [[caesium]] in locally grown coconut milk.  Plants and trees absorb potassium as part of the normal biological process, but will also readily absorb caesium if present, being of the same group on the [[periodic table]], and therefore very similar chemically.  Islanders consuming contaminated coconut milk were found to have abnormally high concentrations of caesium in their bodies and then had to be evacuated from the atoll a second time. <ref name=ghostfleet></ref> . 

==Weapon history==. 
The [[Soviet Union]] had previously used lithium deuteride in their [[Sloika]] design (known as the "Alarm Clock" in the U.S.), in 1953. It was not a "true" hydrogen bomb. Fusion provided only 15–20% of its yield, most coming from [[Boosted fission weapon|boosted fission]] reactions. Its yield was limited to 400 kilotons, and could not be infinitely scaled, as with a true thermonuclear device. <ref>See [[Joe-4]] for a full discussion. </ref> . 

The [[Teller-Ulam]]-based [[Ivy Mike]] device had a much greater yield of 10.4&nbsp;[[TNT equivalent|MT]], but most of this also came from fission: 77% of the total
came from fast fission of its natural uranium tamper.  . 

Castle Bravo had the greatest yield of any U.S. nuclear test, 15&nbsp;MT, though
again, a substantial fraction came from fission. In the Teller-Ulam design, the fission and fusion stages were kept physically separate in a reflective cavity. The radiation from the exploding fission primary brought the fuel in the fusion secondary to critical density and pressure, setting off thermonuclear (fusion) chain-reactions, which in turn set off a tertiary fissioning of the bomb's outer casing. Consequently this type of bomb is also known as a [[Boosted_fission_weapon|"fission-fusion-fission"]] device.  The Soviets, led by [[Andrei Sakharov]], independently [[Sakharov's Third Idea|developed]] and [[RDS-37|tested]] their first Teller-Ulam device in 1955.  . 

The Shrimp device design later evolved into the [[Mark 21 nuclear bomb|Mk-21]] bomb, of which 275 units were produced, weighing 15,000 pounds (6,800&nbsp;kg) and measuring 12.5 feet (3.8&nbsp;m) long and 56&nbsp;inches (1.4&nbsp;m) in diameter. This 4 megaton bomb was produced until July 1956. In 1957, it was converted into the [[Mark 36 nuclear bomb|Mk-36]] and entered into production again. <br clear=all> .
