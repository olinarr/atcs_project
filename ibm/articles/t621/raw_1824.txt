{{Anti-nuclear movement}} . 

The '''anti-nuclear movement in the United States''' consists of more than 80 [[anti-nuclear]] groups that oppose [[nuclear power]], [[nuclear weapons]], or both. These include the [[Abalone Alliance]], [[Clamshell Alliance]], [[Institute for Energy and Environmental Research]], [[Nuclear Information and Resource Service]], and [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]]. The anti-nuclear movement has delayed construction or halted commitments to build some new nuclear plants,<ref name=protest/> and has pressured the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] to enforce and strengthen the safety regulations for nuclear power plants. <ref>Jerry Brown and Rinaldo Brutoco (1997).

[[File:US nuclear sites map.svg|thumb|Map of major U.S. nuclear weapons infrastructure sites during the Cold War and into the present. Places with grayed-out names are no longer functioning and are in various stages of environmental remediation.]]
The nuclear debate initially was about nuclear weapons policy, and began within the scientific community. Scientific concern about the adverse health effects arising from atmospheric [[nuclear weapons testing]] first emerged in 1954. <ref>Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 55. </ref>  Professional associations such as the [[Federation of Atomic Scientists]] and the [[Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs]] were involved. <ref name=jerry/>  The [[Peace Action|National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy]] was formed in November 1957, and surveys showed rising public uneasiness about the [[nuclear arms race]] -- especially atmospheric nuclear weapons tests that sent [[radioactive fallout]] around the globe. <ref>[[Lawrence S. Wittner]]. [http://www.hnn.us/articles/122716.html Preserving the Golden Rule as a Piece of Anti-Nuclear History] ''History News Network'', 8 February 2010. </ref> In 1962, [[Linus Pauling]] won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his work to stop the atmospheric testing of [[nuclear weapons]], and the "Ban the Bomb" movement spread throughout the United States. <ref name=jerry>Jerry Brown and Rinaldo Brutoco (1997). ''Profiles in Power: The Anti-nuclear Movement and the Dawn of the Solar Age'', Twayne Publishers, pp. 191-192. </ref>    . 

Between 1945 and 1992, the United States maintained a program of vigorous [[nuclear weapons testing]]. A total of 1,054 nuclear tests and two nuclear attacks were conducted, with over 900 of them at the [[Nevada]] [[Nevada Test Site|Test Site]], and ten on miscellaneous sites in the United States ([[Alaska]], [[Colorado]], [[Mississippi]], and [[New Mexico]]). <ref>Carey Sublette, [http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Tests/ Gallery of U.S. Nuclear Tests]</ref> Until November 1962, the vast majority of the U.S. tests were above-ground; after the acceptance of the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] all testing was relegated underground, in order to prevent the dispersion of [[nuclear fallout]].  . 

The U.S. program of atmospheric nuclear testing [[Downwinders|exposed some people to the hazards of fallout]]. Since the [[Radiation Exposure Compensation Act]] of 1990, more than $1.38 billion in compensation has been approved. The money is going to people who took part in the tests, notably at the Nevada Test Site, and to others exposed to the radiation. <ref name=compo>[http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=7159303 What governments offer to victims of nuclear tests] ''The Associated Press'', March 24, 2009. </ref><ref>[http://www.usdoj.gov/civil/omp/omi/Tre_SysClaimsToDateSum.pdf Radiation Exposure Compensation System: Claims to Date]</ref> . 

===Emergence of the anti-nuclear power movement===. 
Unexpectedly high costs in the nuclear weapons program created "...pressure on federal officials to develop a civilian nuclear power industry that could help justify the government's considerable expenditures."<ref name=jbs1996>John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). ''Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk'', Transaction Publishers, p. 136. </ref>  . 

The [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954]] encouraged private corporations to build nuclear reactors and a significant learning phase followed with many early partial [[core meltdown]]s and accidents at experimental reactors and research facilities. <ref name=bks/> This led to the introduction of the [[Price-Anderson Act]] in 1957, which was, "...an implicit admission that nuclear power provided risks that producers were unwilling to assume without federal backing."<ref name=bks>[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]]. The costs of failure: A preliminary assessment of major energy accidents, 1907–2007, ''[[Energy Policy]]'' 36 (2008), p. 1808. </ref> The Price-Anderson Act "...shields nuclear utilities, vendors and suppliers against liability claims in the event of a catastrophic accident by imposing an upper limit on private sector liability." Without such protection, private companies were unwilling to become involved. No other technology in the history of American industry has enjoyed such continuing blanket protection. <ref name=jbs1996/>  . 

The first U.S. reactor to face public opposition was [[Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station|Fermi 1]] in 1957. It was built approximately 30 miles from Detroit and there was opposition from the [[United Auto Workers Union]]. <ref>Michael D. Mehta (2005). [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=zVoPQCkGETEC&dq=antinuclear+protests&lr=&source=gbs_navlinks_s Risky business: nuclear power and public protest in Canada] Lexington Books, p. 35. </ref> . 

[[Pacific Gas & Electric]] planned to build the first commercially viable [[nuclear power plant]] in the USA at [[Bodega Bay]],  north of [[San Francisco]]. The proposal was controversial and conflict with local citizens began in 1958. <ref name=well>Paula Garb. [http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/volume_6/wellockvol6.htm  Review of Critical Masses], ''Journal of Political Ecology'', Vol 6, 1999. </ref> The proposed plant site was close to the [[San Andreas fault]] and close to the region's environmentally sensitive fishing and dairy industries. The [[Sierra Club]] became actively involved. <ref>Thomas Raymond Wellock (1998). [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=4zigZvQ1wm8C&dq=bodega+bay+nuclear&printsec=frontcover&source=in&hl=en&ei=oRUqSu_BE9iOkAXoj_H4Cg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=12#PPP1,M1 Critical Masses: Opposition to Nuclear Power in California, 1958-1978], The University of Wisconsin Press, pp. 27-28. </ref> The conflict ended in 1964, with the forced abandonment of plans for the power plant. Historian [[Thomas Wellock]] traces the birth of the [[anti-nuclear movement]] to the controversy over Bodega Bay. <ref name=well/>  Attempts to build a nuclear power plant in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] were similar to those at Bodega Bay and were also abandoned. <ref name=well/>   . 

Nuclear accidents continued into the 1960s with a small test reactor exploding at the [[SL-1|Stationary Low-Power Reactor Number One]] in Idaho Falls in January 1961 and a partial meltdown at the [[Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station]] in Michigan in 1966. <ref name=bks/>  . 

In his 1963 book ''Change, Hope and the Bomb'', [[David E. Lilienthal]] criticized nuclear developments, particularly the nuclear industry's failure to address the [[High-level radioactive waste management|nuclear waste]] question. He argued that it would be "...particularly irresponsible to go ahead with the construction of full scale nuclear power plants without a safe method of nuclear waste disposal having been demonstrated." However, Lilienthal stopped short of a blanket rejection of nuclear power. His view was that a more cautious approach was necessary. <ref name=rudig>Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 61. </ref> . 

Samuel Walker, in his book ''[[Three Mile Island: A Nuclear Crisis in Historical Perspective]]'', explains that the growth of the nuclear industry in the U.S. occurred as the [[environmental movement]] was being formed.  Environmentalists saw the advantages of nuclear power in reducing air pollution, but became critical of nuclear technology on other grounds. <ref name=ten/>  The view that nuclear power was better for the environment than conventional fuels was partially undermined in the late 1960s when major controversy erupted over the effects of waste heat from nuclear plants on water quality.  The nuclear industry "...gradually and reluctantly took action to reduce thermal pollution by building cooling towers or ponds for plants on inland waterways."<ref name=ten>Walker, J. Samuel (2004). ''[[Three Mile Island (book)|Three Mile Island]]: A Nuclear Crisis in Historical Perspective'' (Berkeley: University of California Press), p. 10. </ref>  . 

Another concern was the effect of radiation emissions from nuclear plants.  Several scientists, including [[John Gofman]] and Arthur Tamplin, challenged the prevailing view that the small amounts of radiation released by nuclear power plants during normal operation were not a problem. They argued "...that the routine releases were a severe threat to public health and could cause tens of thousands of deaths from cancer each year."<ref name=ten/> Exchange of views about radiation risks caused  uneasiness about nuclear power, especially among those unable to evaluate the conflicting claims. <ref name=ten/>  . 

Another issue was reactor safety. The large size of nuclear plants ordered during the late 1960s raised new safety questions and created fears of a severe reactor accident that would send large quantities of radiation into the environment.  In the early 1970s, a highly contentious debate over the performance of emergency core cooling systems in nuclear plants, designed to prevent a core meltdown that could lead to the "[[China syndrome]]", received coverage in the popular media and technical journals. <ref name=eleven>Walker, J. Samuel (2004). ''[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=tf0AfoynG-EC&dq=Three+Mile+Island:+A+Nuclear+Crisis+in+Historical+Perspective&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=OouUwdMQpH&sig=GkKocK36A1bZhmqt_Nm4O6zWQKw&hl=en&ei=lFtKS7TIDY3U7AOKq_jXCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=&f=false Three Mile Island: A Nuclear Crisis in Historical Perspective]'' (Berkeley: University of California Press), pp. 10-11. </ref><ref name=wrudig>Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, pp. 66-67. </ref> The emergency core cooling systems controversy opened up the question of whether the AECs first priority was promotion of the nuclear industry or protection of public health and safety. <ref name=jb144>John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). ''Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk'', Transaction Publishers, p. 144. </ref>  . 

{{anchor|All-Atomic Comics}}[[File:All-Atomic Comics (1st edition front cover).jpg|thumb|right|''All-Atomic Comics'' (1976)<BR>"The arguments against nuclear power are not as well-known […but] raise very serious questions."]] . 

By the early 1970s, anti-nuclear activity had increased dramatically in conjunction with concerns about nuclear safety and criticisms of a policy-making process that allowed little voice for these concerns. Initially scattered and organized at the local level, opposition to nuclear power became a national movement by the mid-1970s when such groups as the [[Sierra Club]], [[Friends of the Earth]], [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], [[Union of Concerned Scientists]], and [[Critical Mass (Anti-nuclear group)|Critical Mass]] became involved. <ref name=sh96>John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). ''Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk'', Transaction Publishers, p. 205. </ref> With the rise of environmentalism in the 1970s, the anti-nuclear movement grew substantially:<ref name=jb144/> 
<blockquote>
In 1975-76, ballot initiatives to control or halt the growth of nuclear power were introduced in eight western states. Although they enjoyed little success at the polls, the controls they sought to impose were sometimes adopted in part by state legislature, most notably in California. Interventions in plant licensing proceedings increased, often focusing on technical issues related to safety. This widespread popular ferment kept the issue before the public and contributed to growing public skepticism about nuclear power. <ref name=jb144/> 
</blockquote> . 

Another major area of on-going concern was [[High-level radioactive waste management|nuclear waste management]]. The absence of a working waste management facility became an important issue by the mid-1970s:
<blockquote>
In 1976, the [[California Energy Commission]] announced that it would not approve any more nuclear plants unless the utilities could specify fuel and waste disposal costs, an impossible task without decision on reprocessing, spent fuel storage and waste disposal. By the late 1970s, over thirty states had passed legislation regulating various activities associated with nuclear waste. <ref>John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). ''Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk'', Transaction Publishers, p. 219. </ref> 
</blockquote> . 

Many technologies and materials associated with the creation of a nuclear power program have a dual-use capability, in that they can be used to make [[nuclear weapons]] if a country chooses to do so. In 1975 over 2,000 prominent scientists signed a Declaration on Nuclear Power, prepared by the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]], warning of the dangers of [[nuclear proliferation]] and urging the President and Congress to suspend the exportation of nuclear power to other countries, and reduce domestic construction until major problems were resolved. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=BQsAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=the+us+antinuclear+movement+1979+bulletin&source=bl&ots=OtTqqzw26T&sig=GfdvhWijgsDFEP-k8z2UPK-zLXE&hl=en&ei=99N3TeTrFISgvQPnjo3LBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The U.S. Anti-nuclear Movement |author=Ann Morrissett Davidon |date=December 1979 |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists }}</ref> [[Ted Taylor (physicist)|Theodore Taylor]], a former nuclear weapons designer, explained, "...the ease with which nuclear bombs could be manufactured if fissionable material was available."<ref name=wrudig/> . 

In 1976, [[Nuclear power whistleblowers|four nuclear engineers]] -- three from GE and one from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission—resigned, stating that nuclear power was not as safe as their superiors were claiming. <ref name=mar/><ref>Jim Falk (1982). ''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', Oxford University Press, p. 95. </ref> These men were engineers who had spent most of their working life building reactors, and their defection galvanized anti-nuclear groups across the country. <ref>[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,918045,00.html  The San Jose Three] ''TIME'', Feb. 16, 1976. </ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,879643,00.html The Struggle over Nuclear Power] ''TIME'', Mar. 08, 1976. </ref> They testified to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy that: 
<blockquote>
"the cumulative effect of all design defects and deficiencies in the design, construction and operations of nuclear power plants makes a nuclear power plant accident, in our opinion, a certain event.  The only question is when, and where. <ref name=mar>Mark Hertsgaard (1983). ''Nuclear Inc. The Men and Money Behind Nuclear Energy'', Pantheon Books, New York, p. 72. </ref>
</blockquote> . 

These issues, together with a series of other environmental, technical, and public health questions, made nuclear power the source of acute controversy.  Public support, which was strong in the early 1960s, had been shaken.  [[Forbes magazine|''Forbes'']], in the September 1975 issue, reported that "the anti-nuclear coalition has been remarkably successful ... [and] has certainly slowed the expansion of nuclear power."<ref name=eleven/>  By the mid-1970s anti-nuclear activism, fueled by dissenting experts, had moved beyond local protests and politics to gain a wider appeal and influence.  Although it lacked a single co-ordinating organization, and did not have uniform goals, it emerged as a movement sharply focused on opposing nuclear power, and the movement's efforts gained a great deal of national attention. <ref name=eleven/> . 

On March 28, 1979, equipment failures and operator error contributed to loss of coolant and a partial core meltdown at the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island Nuclear Power Plant]] in Pennsylvania.  The World Nuclear Association has stated that cleanup of the damaged nuclear reactor system at TMI-2 took nearly 12 years and cost approximately US $973 million. <ref name=world>World Nuclear Association. [http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf36.html Three Mile Island Accident] January 2010. </ref> [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]], in his 2007 preliminary assessment of major energy accidents, estimated that the TMI accident caused a total of $2.4 billion in property damages. <ref>Benjamin K. Sovacool.

''Nuclear Inc. The Men and Money Behind Nuclear Energy'', Pantheon Books, New York, p. 95 & 97. </ref> . 

The 1979 Three Mile Island accident inspired Perrow's book ''[[Normal Accidents]]'', where a [[nuclear accident]] occurs, resulting from an unanticipated interaction of multiple failures in a complex system. TMI was an example of a normal accident because it was "...unexpected, incomprehensible, uncontrollable and unavoidable."<ref>Perrow, C. (1982), ‘The President’s Commission and the Normal Accident’, in Sils, D., Wolf, C. and Shelanski, V. (Eds), ''Accident at Three Mile Island: The Human Dimensions'', Westview, Boulder, pp.173–184. </ref> 
<blockquote>
Perrow concluded that the failure at Three Mile Island was a consequence of the system's immense complexity. Such modern high-risk systems, he realized, were prone to failures however well they were managed. It was inevitable that they would eventually suffer what he termed a 'normal accident'. Therefore, he suggested, we might do better to contemplate a radical redesign, or if that was not possible, to abandon such technology entirely. <ref name=nature477>{{cite web |url= |title=In retrospect:Normal accidents |author=Nick Pidgeon |date=22 September 2011 Vol 477 |work=Nature }}</ref>

===Complexity of nuclear power===. 
{{See also|nuclear power debate}}
Nuclear power plants are a complex energy system. <ref name=stor>Storm van Leeuwen, Jan (2008). [http://www.stormsmith.nl/ Nuclear power – the energy balance]</ref><ref>Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 53 & p. 61. </ref>  and opponents of nuclear power have criticized the sophistication and complexity of the technology. [[Helen Caldicott]] has said: "... in essence, a nuclear reactor is just a very sophisticated and dangerous way to boil water -- analogous to cutting a pound of butter with a chain saw."<ref>Helen Caldicott (2006).  ''Nuclear power is not the answer to global warming or anything else'', Melbourne University Press, ISBN 0-522-85251-3, p.xvii</ref> These critics of nuclear power advocate the use of [[energy conservation]], [[efficient energy use]], and appropriate [[renewable energy]] technologies to create our energy future. <ref name=autogenerated1>Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (undated). [http://www.cleanenergy.org/programs/programs.cfm?ID=4 Why Nuclear is Risky]</ref>  . 

[[Amory Lovins]], from the [[Rocky Mountain Institute]], has argued that centralized electricity systems with giant power plants are becoming obsolete. In their place are emerging "distributed resources"—smaller, decentralized electricity supply sources (including efficiency) that are cheaper, cleaner, less risky, more flexible, and quicker to deploy. Such technologies are often called "[[soft energy technologies]]" and Lovins viewed their impacts as more gentle, pleasant, and manageable than hard energy technologies such as nuclear power. <ref>Amory B. Lovins (1977). ''Soft Energy Paths: Toward a Durable Peace'', Penguin Books. </ref> . 

Nuclear energy systems have a long stay time. The completion of the sequence of activities related to one commercial nuclear power station, from the start of construction through the safe disposal of its last radioactive waste, may take 100–150 years. <ref name=stor/> .

Many religious groups in America have a strong record of opposing [[nuclear weapons]]. Rejecting the development,  deployment and use of nuclear weapons is "...one of the most widely shared convictions across faith traditions."<ref name=thistle/> In the 1980s religious groups organized anti-nuclear marches involving hundreds of thousands of people, and the Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish communities published explicitly anti-nuclear statements. Specific groups involved included the American Catholic Bishops, the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] and the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]. Muslims also began to speak out against nuclear weapons in 2000. <ref name=thistle>Susan Brooks Thistlethwaite.

The platform adopted by the delegates of the [[Green Party (United States)]] at their annual Green Congress May 26–28, 2000, reflecting the majority views of the membership, included the creation of self-reproducing, [[renewable energy]] systems and use of federal investments, purchasing, mandates, and incentives to shut down nuclear power plants and phase out [[fossil fuels]]. <ref>Green Party USA (undated).

==People with anti-nuclear views==. 
===Al Gore===. 
Former vice president [[Al Gore]] says he is not anti-nuclear, but has stated that the "...cost of the present generation of reactors is nearly prohibitive."<ref>Anthony Faiola. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/23/AR2009112303966_pf.html Nuclear power regains support] ''The Washington Post'', November 24, 2009. </ref> In his 2009 book, ''[[Our Choice]]'', Gore argues that nuclear power was once "expected to provide virtually unlimited supplies of low-cost electricity", but the reality is that it has been "...an energy source in crisis for the last 30 years."<ref name=gor/> Worldwide growth in nuclear power has slowed in recent years, with no new reactors and an "actual decline in global capacity and output in 2008." In the United States, "...no nuclear power plants ordered after 1972 have been built to completion."<ref name=gor>Al Gore (2009). ''Our Choice'', Bloomsbury, p. 152. </ref>
<blockquote>
Of the 253 nuclear power reactors originally ordered in the United States from 1953 to 2008, 48 percent were canceled, 11 percent were prematurely shut down, 14 percent experienced at least a one-year-or-more outage, and 27 percent are operating without having a year-plus outage. Thus, only about one fourth of those ordered, or about half of those completed, are still operating and have proved relatively reliable. <ref>Al Gore (2009). ''[[Our Choice]]'', p. 157. </ref>   
</blockquote> . 

===Amory Lovins===. 
In his 2005 book ''[[Winning the Oil Endgame]]'', [[Amory Lovins]] praises nuclear power engineers, but is critical of the nuclear industry:
<blockquote>
No vendor has made money selling power reactors. This is the greatest failure of any enterprise in the industrial history of the world. We don’t mean that as a criticism of nuclear power’s practitioners, on whose skill and devotion we all continue to depend; the impressive operational improvements in U.S. power reactors in recent years deserve great credit. It is simply how technologies and markets evolved, despite the best intentions and immense effort. In nuclear power’s heydey, its proponents saw no competitors but central coal-fired power stations. Then, in quick succession, came end-use efficiency, combined-cycle plants, distributed generation (including versions that recovered valuable heat previously wasted), and competitive windpower. The range of competitors will only continue to expand more and their costs to fall faster than any nuclear technology can match. <ref>Lovins, Amory (2005). [http://www.rmi.org/rmi/Library/2004-08_WTOEExecSummary Winning the Oil Endgame] p. 259. </ref>
</blockquote> . 

In 1988, Lovins argued that improving energy efficiency can simultaneously ameliorate [[greenhouse warming]], reduce [[acid rain]] and [[air pollution]], save money, and avoid the problems of nuclear power. Given the urgency of abating global warming, Lovins stated that we cannot afford to invest in nuclear power when those same dollars put into efficiency would displace far more [[carbon dioxide]]. <ref>Rocky Mountain Institute (1988). [http://www.rmi.org/sitepages/pid258.php E88-31, Global Warming]</ref> . 

In “Nuclear Power: Climate Fix or Folly,” published in 2010, Lovins argued that expanded nuclear power "...does not represent a cost-effective solution to global warming and that investors would shun it were it not for generous government subsidies lubricated by intensive lobbying efforts."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/28/renewing-support-for-renewables/ |title=Renewing Support for Renewables |author=Nancy Folbre |date=March 28, 2011  |work=New York Times }}</ref> . 

===Joseph Romm===. 
[[Joseph Romm]] contends that nuclear power generates about 20 percent of all U.S. electricity, and because it is a low-carbon source of around-the-clock power, it has received renewed interest in recent years. <ref name=rom>Romm, Joe (2008). [http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/2008/pdf/nuclear_report.pdf The Self-Limiting Future of Nuclear Power] p. 1. </ref> Yet, Romm argues, nuclear power’s "own myriad limitations will constrain its growth, especially in the near term", and the limitations include:<ref name=rom/> . 

*Prohibitively high, and escalating, capital costs
*Production bottlenecks in key components needed to build plants
*Very long construction times
*Concerns about uranium supplies and importation issues
*Unresolved problems with availability and security of radioactive waste storage, which has a 100,000 year shelf life
*Large-scale water use and contamination amid shortages
*High electricity prices from new plants<ref name=rom/> . 

===Lester Brown===. 
[[Lester Brown]] argues that nuclear power is simply not economical,<ref>Earth Policy Institute (2008). [http://www.earthpolicy.org/Updates/2008/Update78.htm The Flawed Economics of Nuclear Power]</ref> and that installed nuclear capacity will probably remain much the same for the foreseeable future: 
<blockquote>
Our assumption is that new openings of nuclear power plants worldwide will simply offset the closing of aging plants, with no overall growth in capacity. If we use full-cost pricing—requiring utilities to absorb the costs of disposing of nuclear waste, of decommissioning the plant when it is worn out, and of insuring the reactors against possible accidents and terrorist attacks—building nuclear plants in a competitive electricity market is simply not economical. <ref name=brown>Brown, Lester R. (2008). [http://www.earth-policy.org/Books/PB3/pb3book.pdf  PLAN B 3.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization] p. 214. </ref>
</blockquote>
Brown states that simple measures, such as changing to more efficient lighting, can lead to significant reductions in energy consumption. <ref>Brown, Lester R. (2008). [http://www.earth-policy.org/Books/PB3/pb3book.pdf  PLAN B 3.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization] p. 215. </ref>
</blockquote> . 

===Christopher Flavin===. 
Many advocates of nuclear power argue that, given the urgency of doing something about climate change quickly, it must be pursued. [[Christopher Flavin]], however, contends that speedy implementation is not one of nuclear power’s strong points:<ref name=flavin>Worldwatch Institute (2008). [http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/SOW08_chapter_6.pdf Building a Low-Carbon Economy] in ''State of the World 2008'', p. 81. </ref> 
<blockquote>
Planning, licensing, and constructing even a single nuclear plant typically takes a decade or more, and plants frequently fail to meet completion deadlines. Due to the dearth of orders in recent decades, the world currently has very limited capacity to manufacture many of the critical components of nuclear plants. Rebuilding that capacity will take a decade or more. <ref name=flavin/>
</blockquote> . 

Given the urgency of the climate problem, Flavin emphasizes the [[Renewable energy commercialization|rapid commercialization of renewable energy]] and [[efficient energy use]]:
<blockquote>
Improved energy productivity and renewable energy are both available in abundance—and new policies and technologies are rapidly making them more economically competitive with fossil fuels. In combination, these energy options represent the most robust alternative to the current energy system, capable of providing the diverse array of energy services that a modern economy requires. Given the urgency of the climate problem, that is indeed convenient. <ref>Worldwatch Institute (2008). [http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/SOW08_chapter_6.pdf Building a Low-Carbon Economy] in ''State of the World 2008'', p. 80. </ref>

==Criticism==. 
The movement has been criticized by some environmentalists and scientists for understating the environmental impact of fossil fuels and renewable resources, and overstating the dangers of nuclear power. <ref>http://www.ecolo.org/media/articles/articles.in.english/love-indep-24-05-04.htm</ref> Bernard Cohen, Professor Emeritus of Physics at the University of Pittsburgh, calculates that nuclear power is many times safer than any other form of power generation. <ref>http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~blc/book/BOOK.html</ref> . 

Patrick Moore, one of the initial founders of [[Greenpeace]], said in a 2008 interview that, " "It wasn't until after I'd left Greenpeace and the climate change issue started coming to the forefront that I started rethinking energy policy in general and realised that I had been incorrect in my analysis of nuclear as being some kind of evil plot."<ref>http://news.cnet.com/From-eco-warrior-to-nuclear-champion/2008-13840_3-6228461.html</ref>   . 

Critics of the movement point to independent studies showing the capital costs of renewable energy sources are higher than those from nuclear power. <ref>http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/ElecCostSUM.pdf</ref>  Critics argue that the amount of waste generated by nuclear power is very small, as all the high-level nuclear waste from 50+ years of operation of the world's nuclear reactors would fit into a single football field to the depth of five feet. <ref>http://evworld.com/currents.cfm?jid=84</ref> By contrast, coal plants create nearly a million tons of waste per day and release more total radioactivity than nuclear plants, due to the uranium and thorium found naturally within the coal.  Nuclear proponents also point out that cost and waste figures are derived from nuclear reactors built using second generation designs, dating from the 1960s. Advanced reactor designs are estimated to be much cheaper to operate, and generate less than 1% the amount of waste of current designs. <ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_Fast_Reactor</ref><ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Bed_Reactor</ref> . 

==Recent developments==. 
{{See also|List of prospective nuclear units in the United States}}
In November 2009, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that nuclear power is emerging as "...perhaps the world's most unlikely weapon against [[climate change]], with the backing of even some green activists who once campaigned against it."<ref name=fai/>  The report said that rather than deride the potential for nuclear power, some environmentalists are embracing it, and that presently there is only "muted opposition" -- nothing like the protests and plant invasions that helped define the anti-nuclear movement in the United States during the 1970s. <ref name=fai>Anthony Faiola. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/23/AR2009112303966_pf.html  Nuclear power regains support] ''The Washington Post'', November 24, 2009. </ref> . 

As of early 2010, anti-nuclear groups such as Physicians for Social Responsibility, NukeFree.org, and NIRS were actively fighting federal loan guarantees for new nuclear plant construction. In February 2010, several groups coordinated a national call-in day to Congress to attempt to stop $54 billion in federal loan guarantees for new nuclear plants. However, the first such loan guarantee of $8.3 billion was offered to Southern Company that same month. <ref>[http://www.ajc.com/business/southern-co-negotiating-on-385423.html Southern Co. negotiating on nuke loan guarantees]</ref> . 

In January 2010, about 175 anti-nuclear activists participated in a 126-mile walk in an effort to block the re-licensing of [[Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant]]. <ref>[http://www.rutlandherald.com/article/BT/20100114/NEWS01/1140347/0/BENNETT Anti-nuclear protesters reach capitol] ''Rutland Herald'', January 14, 2010. </ref> In February 2010, a large number of anti-nuclear activists and private citizens gathered in Montpelier, to be at hand as the [[Vermont Senate]] voted 26 to 4 against the "Public Good" certificate needed for continued operation of Vermont Yankee past 2012. <ref>{{cite news | author = Wald, Matthew |title = Vermont Senate Votes to Close Nuclear Plant | work = The New York Times | date = February 25, 2010}}</ref> . 

In April 2010 a dozen environmental groups (including [[Friends of the Earth]], South Carolina's [[Sierra Club]], [[List of anti-nuclear groups in the United States#Nuclear Watch South|Nuclear Watch South]], the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, Georgia Women's Action for New Directions) stated that the proposed [[AP1000]] reactor containment design is "...inherently less safe than current reactors."<ref name=pavey/> [[Arnold Gundersen]], a nuclear engineer, authored a 32-page report arguing that the new AP1000 reactors will be vulnerable to leaks caused by corrosion holes. There are plans to construct the Westinghouse AP1000 reactors at seven sites across the southeast, including Plant Vogtle in Burke County, Georgia. <ref name=pavey>Rob Pavey. [http://m.chronicle.augusta.com/latest-news/2010-04-21/groups-say-new-vogtle-reactors-need-study?v=1271900068 Groups say new Vogtle reactors need study] ''Augusta Chronicle'', April 21, 2010. </ref><ref>Matthew L.

In October 2010, Michael Mariotte, executive director of the [[Nuclear Information and Resource Service]] anti-nuclear group, predicted that the U.S. nuclear industry will not experience a [[nuclear renaissance]], for the most simple of reasons: “nuclear reactors make no economic sense”. The economic slump has driven down electricity demand and the price of competing energy sources, and Congress has failed of to pass climate change legislation, making nuclear economics very difficult. <ref>Matthew L. Wald. [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/11/business/energy-environment/11power.html?partner=rss&emc=rss Sluggish Economy Curtails Prospects for Building Nuclear Reactors], ''The New York Times'', October 10, 2010. </ref> . 

Governor-elect [[Peter Shumlin]] is a prominent opponent of the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant and two days after Shumlin was elected in November 2010, [[Entergy]] put the plant up for sale. <ref name=NYT02>Wald, Matthew L. (November 4, 2010). [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/05/business/energy-environment/05nuke.html?_r=1&src=busln Vermont Nuclear Plant Up for Sale] ''The New York Times''. </ref> . 

===Post-Fukushima=== . 

Following the [[2011 Japanese nuclear accidents]], activists who were involved in the movement’s emergence (such as [[Graham Nash]] and [[Paul Gunter]]), suggest that Japan’s nuclear crisis may rekindle an anti-nuclear protest movement in the United States. The aim, they say, is "...not just to block the Obama administration’s push for new nuclear construction, but to convince Americans that existing plants pose dangers."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/19/science/earth/19antinuke.html?_r=1 |title=Japan Crisis Could Rekindle U.S. Antinuclear Movement |author=Leslie Kaufman |date=March 18, 2011 |work=New York Times }}</ref> . 

In March 2011, 600 people gathered for a weekend protest outside the Vermont Yankee plant. The demonstration was held to show support for the thousands of Japanese people who are endangered by possible radiation from the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]]. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wcax.com/Global/story.asp?S=14288307 |title=Vermont Yankee: Countdown to closure |date=March 21, 2011 |work=WCAX  }}</ref> . 

In April 2011, Rochelle Becker, executive director of the Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility said that the United States should review its nuclear accident liability limits, in the light of the economic impacts of the Fukushima disaster. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/04/18/EDAV1J2TQ7.DTL |title=Who would pay if nuclear disaster happened here? |author=Rochelle Becker  |date=April 18, 2011   |work=San Francisco Chronicle  }}</ref> . 

The New England region has a long history of [[anti-nuclear]] activism and 75 people held a State House rally on April 6, 2011, to "protest the region’s aging nuclear plants and the increasing stockpile of radioactive spent fuel rods at them."<ref name=regainsvoice/> The protest was held shortly before a State House hearing where legislators were scheduled to hear representatives of the region’s three nuclear plants – Pilgrim in Plymouth, Vermont Yankee in Vernon, and Seabrook in New Hampshire -- talk about the safety of their reactors in the light of the Japanese nuclear crisis. Vermont Yankee and Pilgrim have designs similar to the crippled Japanese nuclear plant. <ref name=regainsvoice>{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2011/04/anti-nuclear_se.html |title=Anti-nuclear sentiment regains its voice at State House rally|author=Martin Finucane  |date=April 6, 2011  |work=Boston.com }}</ref> . 

As of April 2011, a total of 45 groups and individuals from across the nation are formally asking the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to immediately suspend all licensing and other activities at 21 proposed nuclear reactor projects in 15 states until the NRC completes a thorough post-[[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|Fukushima reactor crisis]] examination. The petitioners also are asking the NRC to supplement its own investigation by establishing an independent commission comparable to that set up in the wake of the serious, though less severe, 1979  [[Three Mile Island accident]]. The petitioners  include [[Public Citizen]], [[Southern Alliance for Clean Energy]], and San Luis Obispo [[Anti-nuclear groups in the United States#Mothers for Peace|Mothers for Peace]]. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://nuclearpower.einnews.com/pr-news/382838-fukushima-fallout-45-groups-and-individuals-petition-nrc-to-suspend-all-nuclear-reactor-licensing-and-conduct-a-credible-three-mile-island-style-review |title=Fukushima Fallout: 45 Groups and Individuals Petition NRC to Suspend All Nuclear Reactor Licensing and Conduct a "Credible" Three Mile Island-Style Review |author= |date=April 14, 2011 |work=Nuclear Power News Today }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2011/04/12/112048/us-begins-to-reconsider-nuclear.html |title=Japan's nuclear crisis comes home as fuel risks get fresh look |author=Renee Schoof  |date=April 12, 2011  |work=McClatchy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfbg.com/politics/2011/04/14/anti-nuclear-movement-gears  |title=Anti nuclear movement gears up |author=Carly Nairn |date=14 April 2011  |work=San Francisco Bay Guardian }}</ref> . 

Thirty two years after the [[No Nukes]] concert in New York, on August 7, 2011, a [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]] benefit concert was held at Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, CA. to raise money for MUSE and for Japanese tsunami/nuclear disaster relief. Artists included Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt, John Hall, Graham Nash, David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Kitaro, Jason Mraz, Sweet Honey and the Rock, the Doobie Brothers, Tom Morello, and Jonathan Wilson. The show was powered off-grid.  . 

In February 2012, the United States [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] approved the construction of two additional reactors at the [[Vogtle Electric Generating Plant]], the first reactors to be approved in over 30 years since the Three Mile Island accident,<ref name=yah12>{{cite web | url=http://news.yahoo.com/first-next-gen-us-reactor-designed-avoid-fukushima-005203660.html | title=First Next-Gen US Reactor Designed to Avoid Fukushima Repeat | publisher=Live Science (hosted on Yahoo!) | date=February 09, 2012 | accessdate=February 09, 2012 | author=Hsu, Jeremy}}</ref> but NRC Chairman [[Gregory Jaczko]] cast a dissenting vote citing safety concerns stemming from Japan's 2011 [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]], and saying "I cannot support issuing this license as if Fukushima never happened". <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/09/us-usa-nuclear-nrc-idUSTRE8182J720120209  |title=U.S. approves first new nuclear plant in a generation  |author=Ayesha Rascoe | date=Feb 9, 2012  |work=Reuters }}</ref> One week after Southern received the license to begin major construction on the two new reactors, a dozen environmental and [[anti-nuclear]] groups are suing to stop the Plant Vogtle expansion project, saying "public safety and environmental problems since Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor accident have not been taken into account". <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ajc.com/business/groups-sue-to-stop-1351830.html |title=Groups sue to stop Vogtle expansion project |author=Kristi E. Swartz |date=February 16, 2012 |work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution }}</ref> . 

The nuclear reactors to be built at Vogtle are new [[AP1000]] third generation reactors, which are said to have safety improvements over older power reactors. <ref name=yah12/> However, John Ma, a senior structural engineer at the NRC, is concerned that some parts of the AP1000 steel skin are so brittle that the "impact energy" from a plane strike or storm driven projectile could shatter the wall. <ref name=bs11/> [[Edwin Lyman]], a senior staff scientist at the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]], is concerned about the strength of the steel containment vessel and the concrete shield building around the AP1000. <ref name=bs11>{{cite web |title=Nuclear energy: Planning for the Black Swan |author=Adam Piore |date=June 2011 |work=Scientific American }}</ref> [[Arnold Gundersen]], a nuclear engineer commissioned by several anti-nuclear groups, released a report which explored a hazard associated with the possible rusting through of the containment structure steel liner. <ref name=mlw>Matthew L.

In March 2012, activists protested the [[San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station]] to mark the one-year anniversary of the nuclear meltdowns in Fukushima, Japan. Around 200 people rallied in San Onofre State Beach to listen to several speakers, including two Japanese residents who lived through the Fukushima meltdowns. ''Residents Organizing for Safe Environment'' and several other [[anti-nuclear]] energy organizations, put on the event and about 100 activists from San Diego were brought in by bus. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytitan.com/2012/03/anti-nuclear-groups-protest-san-onofre/ |title=Anti nuclear groups protest San Onofre |author=Jameson Steed |date=March 12, 2012  |work=Daily Titan }}</ref> . 

As of March 2012, 23 aging nuclear power plants continue to operate, including some similar in design to those that melted down in Fukushima, such as Vermont Yankee, and Indian Point 2 just 24 miles north of New York City. Vermont Yankee has reached the end of its projected lifetime operation, but the NRC favors extending its license, despite strong local opposition. On March 22, 2012, more than 1,000 people marched in protest to the plant, and about 130 engaging in civil disobedience were arrested, including the stalwart 93-year-old anti-nuclear activist [[Frances Crowe]]. <ref name=nancy2012>{{cite web |url=http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/26/the-nurture-of-nuclear-power/ |title=The Nurture of Nuclear Power |author=[[Nancy Folbre]] |date=March 26, 2012 |work=New York Times }}</ref>  . 

According to a 2012 [[Pew Research Center]] poll, 44 percent of Americans favor and 49 percent oppose the promotion of increased use of nuclear power, while 69 percent favor increasing federal funding for research on [[wind power]], [[solar power]] and hydrogen energy technology. <ref name=nancy2012/><ref name=pewpoll2012>{{cite web |url=http://www.people-press.org/files/legacy-pdf/3-19-12%20Energy%20release.pdf |title=As Gas Prices Pinch, Support for Oil and Gas Production Grows |author=The Pew Research Center For The People and The Press |date=March 19, 2012 }}</ref> .
