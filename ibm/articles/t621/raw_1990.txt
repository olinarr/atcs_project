'''Nuclear [[blackmail]]''' is a form of [[nuclear strategy]] in which an aggressor uses the [[Threat of force (public international law)|threat]] of use of [[nuclear weapon]]s to force an adversary to perform some action or make some concessions. It is a type of [[extortion]], related to [[brinkmanship]].  . 

==Effectiveness== . 

Nuclear blackmail is considered most effective when the person making the threat is unhinged and ostensibly willing to commit [[suicide]].  (See [[game theory]]). The prevention of these threats by irrational actors is the stated purpose behind the [[National Missile Defense]] program undertaken by President [[George W. Bush]] of the United States.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} . 

It is generally regarded as ineffective against a rational opponent who has or is an ally of someone who has [[assured destruction]] capability. If both states have [[nuclear weapon]]s, the form of nuclear blackmail becomes a threat of [[escalation]]. In this situation if the opponent refuses to respond, then one's choices are either surrender or suicide. During the [[Cold War]], the explicit threat of [[nuclear warfare]] to force an opponent to perform an action was rare in that most nations were allies of either the [[Soviet Union]] or the [[United States]].  . 

==History== . 

The United States issued several nuclear threats against the [[People's Republic of China]] in the 1950s to force the evacuation of outlying islands and the cessation of attacks against [[Quemoy]] and [[Matsu (islands)|Matsu]], part of [[Republic of China]]. <ref> Edward Friedman, “Nuclear Blackmail and the end of the Korean War,” ''Modern China'' 1 1 (Jan. 1975), 75-91. </ref> . 

Recently declassified documents from the [[National Archives (UK)]] indicate that the [[United Kingdom]] considered threatening [[China]] with nuclear retaliation in 1961 in the case of a military reclamation of [[Hong Kong]] by China. <ref name="BBC news">{{cite news | title= UK pondered China nuclear attack |date=2006-06-30|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5130524.stm}}</ref>  . 

The unwillingness of the [[Soviet Union]] to respond to these threats on China's behalf was one of the major factors in the Chinese decision to develop an independent nuclear arsenal.{{Fact|date=October 2007}} . 

It has been claimed that [[Margaret Thatcher]] threatened nuclear retaliation against [[Argentina]] during the 1982 [[Falklands War]]. <ref>{{cite news | title= Thatcher 'threatened to nuke Argentina' |date=2005-11-22|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/nov/22/books.france}}</ref> . 

==In fiction== . 

Nuclear blackmail, typically by a [[supervillain]] rather than a state, has been frequently employed as a [[plot device]] in [[spy fiction]] and [[action film]]s. Since such a scheme appeared in the film ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', the [[trope (literature)|trope]] has been particularly associated with the [[James Bond]] series and in [[24 (TV series)]]. The notion of a supervillain threatening world leaders with a nuclear device has since become a cliché, and has been [[parody|parodied]] in Charles K. Feldman's ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'', ''[[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[You Only Move Twice]]", and other espionage spoofs.  .
