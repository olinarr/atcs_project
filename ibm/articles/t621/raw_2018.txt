The '''B83''' [[nuclear weapon]] is a [[variable yield]] [[gravity bomb]] developed by the [[United States]] in the late 1970s, entering service in [[1983 in aviation|1983]]. With a maximum yield of 1.2 megatons, it is currently the most powerful nuclear weapon in the US arsenal<ref>{{cite news|title=End of an Era: Last of Big Atomic Bombs dismantled|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2011%2F10%2F25%2FMNJ11LM9T8.DTL|publisher=SF Chronicle | first=Betsy|last=Blaney|date=26 October 2011}}</ref> . It was designed at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], and the first underground test detonation took place on 15 December 1984.  . 

== History == . 

It was based partly on the earlier [[B77 nuclear bomb|B77]] program, which was terminated due to cost overruns. The B83 replaced several earlier weapons, including the [[B28 nuclear bomb|B28]], [[B43 nuclear bomb|B43]], and to some extent the ultra-high yield [[B53 nuclear bomb|B53]]. It was the first U.S. nuclear weapon designed from the start to avoid accidental detonation, with the use of 'insensitive' explosive in the trigger lens system. Its layout is similar to the smaller [[B61 nuclear bomb|B61]], with the [[warhead]] mounted in the forward part of the weapon to deliberately make the bomb nose-heavy. It was intended for high-speed carriage (up to [[Mach (speed)|Mach]] 2.0) and delivery at either high or low altitude. For the latter role, it is equipped with a parachute retardation system, with a 46 ft (14 m) [[Kevlar]] [[ribbon parachute]] capable of rapid deceleration. It can be employed in free fall, retarded, contact, or [[laydown delivery|laydown]] modes, for either [[air burst]] or [[ground burst]] detonation. Security features include next-generation [[permissive action link]] (PAL) locks, and a command disablement system (CDS), rendering the weapon tactically useless without a nuclear yield.  . 

== Design == . 

The bomb is 12 feet (3.67 m) long, with a diameter of 18 inches (457 mm); the actual nuclear explosive package, judging from published drawings, occupies some 3 or 4 feet (90 to 120 cm) in the forward part of the bomb case. The bomb weighs approximately 2,400 pounds (1,100 kg); the location of the lifting lugs shows that the greater part of the total mass is contained in the nuclear explosive. It has a [[variable yield]]: the destructive power is adjustable from somewhere in the low [[kiloton]] range up to a maximum of 1.2 [[TNT equivalent|megatons]] (1.2 million tons of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]]).  . 

The '''B83''' can be deployed by a wide range of U.S. [[aircraft]] including: . 

*[[B-1B Lancer|B-1B]]
*[[B-2 Spirit|B-2A]]
*[[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52H]]
*[[F-15E Strike Eagle|F-15E]]
*[[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16A/B/C/D]]
*[[F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18A/B/C/D/E/F]]
*[[F-22 Raptor|F-22A]] in external configurations{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} . 

About 650 B83s were built, and the weapon remains in service as part of the United States "[[Enduring Stockpile]]." . 

==Novel uses==. 
The B83 is one of the weapons considered for use in the "[[Nuclear bunker buster|Nuclear Bunker Buster]]" project, which for a time was known as the ''Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator'', or ''RNEP''. While most efforts have focused on the smaller [[B61 nuclear bomb|B61-11 nuclear bomb]], [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] was also analyzing the use of the B83 in this role.  . 

The warhead contained within the B83 has been considered for use against near earth asteroids.  Six such warheads, configured for the maximum 1.2MT yield, would be deployed by maneuvering space vehicles to 'knock' an asteroid off course, should it pose a risk to the earth. <ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/08/03/215924/nasa-plans-armageddon-spacecraft-to-blast-asteroid.html "NASA plans 'Armageddon' spacecraft to blast asteroid" article at Flightglobal.com]</ref> . 

==In popular culture==. 
*In the 1996 film ''[[Broken Arrow (1996 film)|Broken Arrow]]'', two B83 bombs are stolen. 
*In the strategy game [[World in Conflict]], a B83 is considered the last resort if the [[US Army]] failed to retake [[Seattle]] from the [[Soviet Union]] before the arrival of the [[People's Liberation Army Navy|PLA]] naval forces.  .
