[[India]] possesses [[nuclear weapon]]s and maintains short- and intermediate-range [[ballistic missile]]s, nuclear-capable aircraft, surface ships, and submarines under development as possible delivery systems and platforms. Although it lacks an operational ballistic missile submarine, India has ambitions of possessing a [[nuclear triad]] in the near future when [[INS Arihant]] the lead ship of India's [[Arihant class submarine|''Arihant'' class]] of [[Nuclear submarine|nuclear-powered submarine]]s formally joins the [[Indian Navy]] in 2011 after undergoing extensive sea-trials. 
Though India has not made any official statements about the size of its nuclear arsenal, recent estimates suggest that India has between 80 and 100 nuclear weapons,<ref name="nuclearweapons1">{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/programs/ssp/nukes/nuclearweapons/nukestatus.html |title=Federation of American Scientists: Status of World Nuclear Forces |publisher=Fas.org |date=June 7, 2011|accessdate=2011-05-04}}</ref> consistent with earlier estimates that it had produced enough weapons-grade plutonium for up to 75–110 nuclear weapons. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/22745 |title=Weapons around the world |publisher=Physicsworld.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-31}}</ref> Production of weapons-grade plutonium is believed to be taking place at the [[Bhabha Atomic Research Centre]], which is home to the [[CIRUS reactor]], acquired from Canada and shut down in 2010, to the indigenous [[Dhruva reactor]], and to a [[Nuclear reprocessing|plutonium separation facility]]. <ref name=NTI_India_Nuclear_Profile>{{cite web|title=India Profile: Nuclear Overview|url=http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/India/Nuclear/index.html|publisher=Nuclear Threat Initiative|accessdate=10 September 2011|month=February|year=2011}}</ref>  . 

India is not a signatory to the 1968 [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT), which India argues entrenches the status quo of the existing nuclear weapons states whilst preventing general nuclear disarmament. <ref>[http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/us-wants-india-to-sign-npt/357348/ US wants India to sign NPT] Business Standard, 7 May 2009. </ref> India tested a nuclear device in 1974 (code-named "[[Smiling Buddha]]"), which it called a "[[Peaceful nuclear explosions|peaceful nuclear explosion]]."  The test used plutonium produced in the Canadian-supplied [[CIRUS]] reactor, and raised concerns that nuclear technology supplied for peaceful purposes could be diverted to weapons purposes.  This also stimulated the early work of the [[Nuclear Suppliers Group]]. <ref>[http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/india/nuclear/2296_6267.html ]{{dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref> India performed further nuclear tests in 1998 (code-named "[[Operation Shakti]]").  . 

India has signed and ratified both the [[Biological Weapons Convention]] and the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]].  . 

==Brief historical overview==. 
As early as 26 June 1946, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], soon to be India's first [[Prime Minister]], announced: {{cquote|As long as the world is constituted as it is, every country will have to devise and use the latest devices for its protection. I have no doubt India will develop her scientific researches and I hope Indian scientists will use the atomic force for constructive purposes. But if India is threatened, she will inevitably try to defend herself by all means at her disposal. <ref>B. M. Udgaonkar, [http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/jan25/articles20.htm ''India’s nuclear capability, her security concerns and the recent tests''], Indian Academy of Sciences, January 1999. </ref>}} . 

[[Smiling Buddha|India's first nuclear test]] occurred on 18 May 1974. <ref name=prolifimpact>{{cite book|last=Perkovich|first=George|title=India's nuclear bomb: the impact on global proliferation|year=2002|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520232105}}</ref> Since then India has conducted another series of tests at the [[Pokhran]] test range in the state of [[Rajasthan]] in 1998. India has an extensive civil and military nuclear program, which includes at least 10 [[nuclear reactor]]s, [[uranium]] mining and milling sites, [[heavy water]] production facilities, a uranium enrichment plant, fuel fabrication facilities, and extensive nuclear research capabilities.  . 

In 1998, as a response to the continuing tests, the United States and Japan imposed temporary economic sanctions on India.  . 

Some nuclear experts have speculated that India obtained nuclear enrichment from illicit proliferation through the [[A.Q. Khan]] Network from [[Pakistan]]. <ref>{{cite web|title=The A.Q.

==Doctrine==. 
India has a declared nuclear [[No first use|no-first-use]] policy and is in the process of developing a nuclear doctrine based on "credible [[minimum deterrence]]." In August 1999, the Indian government released a draft of the doctrine<ref name=NFU>[http://www.indianembassy.org/policy/CTBT/nuclear_doctrine_aug_17_1999.html Draft Report of National Security Advisory Board on Indian Nuclear Doctrine]</ref>{{dead link|date=December 2010}} which asserts that nuclear weapons are solely for deterrence and that India will pursue a policy of "retaliation only". The document also maintains that India "will not be the first to initiate a nuclear first strike, but will respond with punitive retaliation should deterrence fail" and that decisions to authorize the use of nuclear weapons would be made by the Prime Minister or his 'designated successor(s).'"<ref name=NFU/> . 

According to the NRDC, despite the escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan in 2001-2002, India remains committed to its nuclear no-first-use policy.  . 

Indian [[National Security Advisor (India)|National Security Advisor]] Shri [[Shivshankar Menon]] signaled a significant shift from "[[No first use]]" to "no first use against non-nuclear weapon states" in a speech on the occasion of Golden Jubilee celebrations of [[National Defence College, India|National Defence College]] in New Delhi on October 21, 2010, a doctrine Menon said reflected India's "strategic culture, with its emphasis on minimal deterrence."<ref>[http://www.mea.gov.in/mystart.php?id=530116584 Speech by NSA Shri Shivshankar Menon at NDC on “The Role of Force in Strategic Affairs”: Web-site of Ministry of External Affairs (Govt. of India)]</ref><ref>[http://www.indiablooms.com/NewsDetailsPage/newsDetails211010n.php NSA Shivshankar Menon at NDC (Speech) : india Blooms]</ref>{{dead link|date=February 2012}} . 

==Command and control==. 
India's [[Strategic Nuclear Command]] was formally established in 2003, with an Air Force officer, Air Marshal Asthana, as the Commander-in-Chief. The joint services SNC is the custodian of all of India's nuclear weapons, [[missiles]] and assets. It is also responsible for executing all aspects of India's nuclear policy. However, the civil leadership, in the form of the CCS (Cabinet Committee on Security) is the only body authorized to order a nuclear strike against another offending strike: In effect, it is the [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] who has his finger "on the button." . 

==International treaties== . 

India is not a signatory to either the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) or the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]] (CTBT), but did accede to the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] in October 1963. India is a member of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), and four of its 17 nuclear reactors are subject to IAEA safeguards.  . 

India announced its lack of intention to accede to the NPT as late as 1997 by voting against the paragraph of a [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] Resolution<ref>{{UN document |docid=A-52-PV.67 |body=General Assembly |type=Verbatim| session=52 |meeting=67 |anchor=pg015-bk01 |date=9 December 1997 |accessdate=2007-08-22 }}</ref> which urged all non-signatories of the treaty to accede to it at the earliest possible date. <ref name="UN_ARES5238">{{UN document |docid=A-RES-52-38 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=52 |highlight=rect_85,384_928,444 |page=16 |accessdate=2007-08-22}}</ref>
[[Image:ShaktiBomb.jpg|thumb|Thermonuclear device used in the Pokhran Test]]
India voted against the UN General Assembly resolution endorsing the [[CTBT]], which was adopted on 10 September 1996. India objected to the lack of provision for universal [[nuclear disarmament]] "within a time-bound framework." India also demanded that the treaty ban laboratory simulations. In addition, India opposed the provision in Article XIV of the CTBT that requires India's ratification for the treaty to enter into force, which India argued was a violation of its sovereign right to choose whether it would sign the treaty. In early February 1997, Foreign Minister I.K.Gujral reiterated India's opposition to the treaty, saying that "India favors any step aimed at destroying nuclear weapons, but considers that the treaty in its current form is not comprehensive and bans only certain types of tests." . 

In August 2008, the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) approved safeguards agreement with India under which the former will gradually gain access to India's civilian nuclear reactors. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2008/board010808.html |title=IAEA approves India nuclear inspection deal&nbsp;— IAEA |publisher=iaea.org |author= |date= |accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref> In September 2008, the [[Nuclear Suppliers Group]] granted India a waiver allowing it to access civilian nuclear technology and fuel from other countries. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/nuclear-suppliers-group-grants-india/story.aspx?guid={BA6E4022-DBC8-4B43-B9DE-62608913CB8A}&dist=hppr |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080920132538/http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/nuclear-suppliers-group-grants-india/story.aspx?guid={BA6E4022-DBC8-4B43-B9DE-62608913CB8A}&dist=hppr |title=Nuclear Suppliers Group Grants India Historic Waiver&nbsp;— MarketWatch |publisher=Marketwatch.com |date=2008-10-06 |archivedate=2008-10-20 |accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref> The implementation of this waiver makes India the only known country with [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nuclear weapons]] which is not a party to the NPT but is still allowed to carry out nuclear commerce with the rest of the world. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5geN2RWjoN4oJhPibc7rhkyxMXfzg |title=AFP: India energised by nuclear pacts |publisher=Afp.google.com |author=3 hours ago |date=3 hours ago |accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref> .

===Ballistic missiles===. 
[[File:Prithvi 02.jpg|thumb|Prithvi I]] . 

==AAD and PAD== . 

Under former president Dr. [[Abdul Kalam]] India pursued the [[Integrated Guided Missile Development Program]] (IGMDP) which was an Indian Ministry of Defense program for the development of a comprehensive range of missiles, including the intermediate range Agni missile (Surface to Surface), and short range missiles such as the Prithvi ballistic missile (Surface to Surface), Akash missile (Surface to Air), Trishul missile (Surface to Air) and Nag Missile (Anti Tank). Other projects such [[Indian Ballistic Missile Defense Program]] have derived from the IGMDP. In 2005, India became only the fourth country to have [[Anti-ballistic missile#Countries with ABM capability|Anti Ballistic]] capability when India tested two systems the AAD and PAD. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.pk/forums/wmd-missiles/37846-can-indias-pad-aad-abm-systems-effective-against-pakistans-missiles.html |title=Can India's PAD and AAD ABM systems effective against pakistans missiles? |publisher=Defence.pk |date= |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref> . 

India has methodically built an indigenous missile production capability, using its commercial space-launch program to develop the skills and infrastructure needed to support an offensive ballistic missile program. For example, during the 1980s, India conducted a series of space launches using the solid-fueled SLV-3 booster. Most of these launches put light satellites into near-earth orbit. Elements of the SLV-3 were subsequently incorporated into two new programs. In the first, the new polar-space launch vehicle ([[PSLV]]) was equipped with six SLV-3 motors strapped to the PSLV's first stage. The Agni IRBM technology demonstrator uses the SLV-3 booster as its first stage.  . 

===Prithvi===. 
The Prithvi (Sanskrit: "Earth") I is mobile liquid-fueled 150 kilometer tactical missile currently deployed with army units. It is claimed that this missile is equipped only with various conventional warheads (which stay attached to the missile over the entire flight path). The missile is of particular interest to the United States (and potential buyers) in that has the capability of maneuvering in flight so as to follow one of several different pre-programmed trajectories. Based on the same design, a modified Prithvi, the Prithvi II, is essentially a longer-ranged version of the Prithvi I except that it has a 250-kilometer range and a lighter payload. It is suspected that any nuclear missions will be executed by the Prithvi II. Currently, the Prithvi II has completed development and is now in production. When fielded, it will be deployed with air force units for the purpose of deep target attacking maneuvers against objectives such as air fields.  . 

* Prithvi I&nbsp;— Army Version (150&nbsp;km range with a payload of 1,000&nbsp;kg)
* Prithvi II&nbsp;— Air Force Version (250&nbsp;km range with a payload of 500&nbsp;kg)
* Prithvi III&nbsp;— Naval Version (350&nbsp;km range with a payload of 500&nbsp;kg) . 

The Prithvi missile project encompassed developing 3 variants for use by the Indian Army, Indian Air Force and the Indian Navy. The initial project framework of the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program outlines the variants in the following manner. in October 2009 India conducted 2 simultenous user trials of 350&nbsp;km extended range Prithvi II to be used for strategic purposes.  . 

====Dhanush====. 
Dhanush ([[Sanskrit]]: Bow) is a naval variant of the [[Prithvi missile]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stratfor.com/india_hunt_indian_submarine_launched_ballistic_missile |title=India: The Hunt for an Indian Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missile |publisher=Stratfor |date=2007-09-11 |accessdate=2010-08-31}}</ref> It can fire either the 250&nbsp;km or the 350&nbsp;km range missiles. Supposedly it is a customised version of the Prithvi and that the additional customizations in missile configuration are to certify it for [[seaworthiness]]. Dhanush has to be launched from a hydraulically stabilized launch pad. Its low range acts against it and thus it is seen a weapons either to be used to destroy an aircraft carrier or an enemy port. Indian Navy's [[Sagarika (missile)|K-15 Sagarika]] [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]] is reported to be a variant of the Dhanush missile. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://sify.com/news/fullstory.php?id=14605617 |title=India to test submarine-launched missile |publisher=Sify.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-31}}</ref> . 

The ship launched Dhanush Ballistic Missile was tested from INS Subhadra of the [[Sukanya class patrol craft]] in 2000.

====Surya==== . 

The report of [[Surya ICBM]] (Sanskrit: Sun) has not been confirmed by officials of the Indian government and have repeatedly denied the existence of the project.The [[Surya ICBM]] is an [[ICBM]] program that has been mentioned repeatedly in the Indian press . <ref name="Globalsecurity"/> Surya (meaning Sun in Sanskrit and many other Indian languages) is the codename for the first Intercontinental Ballistic Missile that India is reported to be developing. The DRDO is believed to have begun the project in 1994.  . 

As the missile is yet to be developed, the specifications of the missile are not known and the entire program continues to remain highly speculative. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stratfor.com/india_u_s_nuclear_deal_and_indian_icbms |title=India: The U.S. Nuclear Deal and Indian ICBMs - Startfor |publisher=Stratfor.com |date=2007-06-21 |accessdate=2010-08-31}}</ref> Estimates of the range of this missile vary from 5,000&nbsp;km<ref name=SuryaTOI/> to 10,000&nbsp;km. <ref>{{cite web|author=Dec 20, 2007 |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/IL20Df01.html |title=India adds oomph to its space race By Siddharth Srivastava |publisher=Atimes.com |date=2007-12-20 |accessdate=2010-08-31}}</ref> It is believed to be a three-stage design, with the first two stages using solid propellants and the third-stage using liquid.

Four decades of investments in a missile-related design, development, and manufacturing infrastructure have also made this sector less vulnerable to long-term disruption by technology denial regimes. More significantly, India's sophisticated civilian satellite launch capability makes it one of the few developing states theoretically capable of building an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/India/Missile/index.html |title=Research Library: Country Profiles: India |publisher=NTI |date= |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref> . 

====Shaurya====. 
The [[Shaurya missile]] (Sanskrit: Valour) is a short-range [[surface-to-surface missile|surface-to-surface]] ballistic missile developed by [[DRDO]] of India for use by the Indian Army. It has a range of 600&nbsp;km and is capable of carrying a payload of one-tonne conventional or nuclear warhead. The Shaurya missile provides India with a significant [[second strike]] capability. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/11/14/stories/2008111456561300.htm |title=Front Page : “Shourya missile cannot be easily detected” |publisher=The Hindu |date=2008-11-14 |accessdate=2010-07-16 |location=Chennai, India}}</ref> Shaurya Missile is considered a land version of the Sagarika. This missile is stored in a composite canister just like the [[BrahMos]] supersonic cruise missile. The composite canister makes the missile much easier to store for long periods without maintenance as well as to handle and transport. It also houses the gas generator to eject the missile from the canister before its solid propellant motors take over to hurl it at the intended target. Shaurya missiles can remain hidden or camouflaged in underground silos from enemy surveillance or satellites till they are fired from the special storage-cum-launch canisters. DRDO Defence scientists admit that given Shaurya's limited range at present, either the silos will have to be constructed closer to India's borders or longer-range missiles will have to be developed. The Shaurya system will require some more tests before it becomes fully operational in two-three years. Moreover, defense scientists say the high-speed, two-stage Shaurya has ''high maneuverability'' which also makes it ''less vulnerable'' to existing anti-missile defense systems. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India_test-fires_submarine-launched_missile/articleshow/3703369.cms|title=India successfully test fires Shaurya missile

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Brahmos.gif|thumb|right|250px|11th test of the army version of BrahMos at a test range in ITR Chandipur {{Deletable image-caption|date=March 2012}}]] -->
BrahMos is a supersonic cruise missile that can be launched from submarines, ships, aircraft or land. It is a joint venture between India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Russia's NPO Mashinostroeyenia who have together formed the BrahMos Aerospace Private Limited. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brahmos.com/content.php?id=1 |title=Joint Venture |publisher=BrahMos.com |date=1998-02-12 |accessdate=2010-08-31}}</ref> . 

The acronym BrahMos is perceived as the confluence of the two nations represented by two rivers, the [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] of India and the [[Moskva River|Moskva]] of Russia. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indian-military.org/strategic-weapons/cruise-missiles/186-brahmos-supersonic-cruise-missile.html |title=Brahmos Supersonic Cruise missile |publisher=Indian-military.org |date=2010-03-12 |accessdate=2010-08-31}}</ref> It travels at speeds of Mach 2.5 to 2.8 and is the world's fastest cruise missile. It is about three-and-a-half times faster than the U.S.A's subsonic Harpoon cruise missile. A hypersonic version of the missile is also presently under development (Lab Tested with 5.26 Mach Speed). 
BrahMos claims to have the capability of attacking surface targets as low as 10 meters in altitude. It can gain a speed of Mach 2.8, and has a maximum range of 290&nbsp;km. <ref>{{cite news|author=22 Mar, 2010, 07.06AM IST,ET Bureau |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/5710243.cms |title=India launches Brahmos cruise missile - Politics/Nation - News - The Economic Times |publisher=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |date=2010-03-22 |accessdate=2010-08-31}}</ref> The ship-launched and land-based missiles can carry a 200&nbsp;kg warhead, whereas the aircraft-launched variant (BrahMos A) can carry a 300&nbsp;kg warhead. It has a two-stage propulsion system, with a solid-propellant rocket for initial acceleration and a liquid-fueled ramjet responsible for sustained supersonic cruise. Air-breathing ramjet propulsion is much more fuel-efficient than rocket propulsion, giving the BrahMos a longer range than a pure rocket-powered missile would achieve.  . 

The high speed of the BrahMos likely gives it better target-penetration characteristics than lighter subsonic cruise-missiles such as the Tomahawk. Being twice as heavy and almost four times faster than the Tomahawk, the BrahMos has almost 32 times the initial kinetic energy of a Tomahawk missile (although it pays for this by having only 3/5 the payload and a fraction of the range despite weighing twice as much, suggesting a different tactical paradigm to achieve the objective).  . 

Although BrahMos is primarily an anti-ship missile, it can also engage land based targets. It can be launched either in a vertical or inclined position and is capable of covering targets over a 360 degree horizon. The BrahMos missile has an identical configuration for land, sea, and sub-sea platforms. The air-launched version has a smaller booster and additional tail fins for added stability during launch. The BrahMos is currently being configured for aerial deployment with the Su-30MKI as its carrier. India has produced more than 110 Brahmos by March 2011 as per SIPRI, inducted 1 regiment of Brahmos Type-I GLCM with 67 missiles.  .

The missile is described as being able to strike several targets simultaneously, which could mean either separate, independently targetable warheads, or a sufficient blast to destroy a number of them.  . 

Along with India, a limited number of other countries including the US and Russia have developed operational multi-target handling surface-to-air missile systems capable of carrying a nuclear warhead.  .

The acquisition was to help the Indian Navy prepare for the introduction of the ATV. The cost to India of acquiring two Akula submarines and their support infrastructure along with training of the crews had been estimated at $2 billion. <ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/s-akula.htm Project 971 Shuka-B Akula class] www.globalsecurity.com</ref> The Indian version was reportedly armed with the 300&nbsp;km range [[3M-54 Klub]] nuclear-capable missiles. <ref name="hindu2006"/> Supposedly on 9 November 2008 one of the two submarines was conducting tests, when an accident on board killed 20 sailors but no damage occurred to the submarine. Though this deal fell apart for some time due to the Indians demanding an upgrade/improvement in some of its safety features, Russia's President Dmitry Medvedev on his official trip to New Delhi said that the deal was back on track and that "The talk is not about selling submarines into India's property, but about their rent by India's navy". <ref>[http://in.news.yahoo.com/137/20081215/738/tnl-russia-mulls-nuclear-sub-lease-to-in.html ]{{dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref> However, unlike the earlier deal the modified deal states that India can only rent and not buy the subs, but defence experts state that the so-called lease agreement is only to divert international attention and that it would be eventually modified and India would inevitably keep the subs. The first submarine will be named [[INS Chakra]]. <ref>{{cite web|author=Press Trust of India |url=http://indiatoday.digitaltoday.in/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=10800&issueid=67 |title="Indian nuclear submarine", India Today, July 2008 edition |publisher=Indiatoday.digitaltoday.in |date=2008-07-03 |accessdate=2010-08-31}}</ref>.

Russia has also offered the advanced Amur Class Submarine, known as the [[S1000 submarine class|S1000]]. According to GlobalSecurity India is already building the [[S1000 submarine class|S1000]] cruise missile submarines in Mazagaon Docks. <ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/project-76.htm |title=Project-75A / Project-75I / Project 76 |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref> The Amur will be most probably fitted with [[P-700 Granit]] or the [[Klub missile|Klub]] cruise missile capable of carrying nuclear warheads.  . 

===Frigates, destroyers and aircraft carriers===. 
[[File:Shivalik Maiden Sortie.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Shivalik class frigate]]s are armed with the [[3M-54 Klub]] and may also incorporate the nuclear capable [[Nirbhay missile]] in the future. Seen here is the [[INS Shivalik]] when under sea trials.]]
Other than submarines, India also maintains ships such as destroyers, modified patrol crafts and frigates which can launch nuclear capable ballistic and cruise missiles.  . 

[[Talwar class frigate]] and [[Shivalik class frigate]] are frigates of the Indian Navy that can fire nuclear capable cruise missiles. INS Tabar and INS Trishul are Talwar class vessel armed with supersonic nuclear [[3M-54 Klub]] cruise missiles while [[INS Shivalik]] was the first vessel of the Shivalik class to incorporate the [[3M-54 Klub]]. Other vessels of the Shivalik Class and Talwar Class are to be armed with the [[BrahMos]] and [[3M-54 Klub]] missiles by 2009 and 2010 respectively. All these frigates are also equipped with [[Barak 1]] missiles or other SAMs and harbour helicopters such as the [[HAL Dhruv]]. In years to come, the [[Nirbhay missile]] is also to be incorporated into [[Talwar class frigate]]s and [[Shivalik class frigate]]s.  . 

[[Rajput class destroyer|Rajput Class]], [[Kolkata class destroyer|Kolkata Class]] and [[Delhi class destroyer|Delhi Class]] are Destroyers of the Indian Navy that may be armed with nuclear capable missile-[[Nirbhay missile|Nirbhay]]. In addition Kolkata Class will also incorporate the Russian nuclear [[3M-54 Klub]] cruise missile. <ref name="ReferenceB"/> . 

The ship launched Dhanush Ballistic Missile was tested from INS Subhadra of the [[Sukanya class patrol craft]] in 2000. INS Subhadra is a patrol vessel which was modified and the missile was launched from the reinforced helicopter deck. The 250&nbsp;km variant was tested but the tests were considered partially successful. <ref name="nrdc.org"/> In 2004, the missile was again tested from the INS Subhadra and was this time successful. <ref name="bharat-rakshak.com"/> Then the following year in December the missile's 350&nbsp;km version was tested from the INS Rajput and hit the land based target. <ref name="domain-b.com"/> . 

[[INS Vikramaditya]] Aircraft Carrier (formerly known as Admiral Gorshkov) was fitted with [[P-500 Bazalt]] nuclear capable cruise missiles of the range of 550&nbsp;km. <ref>[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/NAVY/ships/future/193-ins-vikramaditya.html ]{{dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref> The Vikramaditya could still be armed with this after its refit. India is also a potential customer for a [[Slava class cruiser]] which also incorporates the [[P-500 Bazalt]].  . 

===Nuclear-capable aircraft===. 
[[Image:Dassault Mirage 2000 2.jpg|thumb|right|Indian Air Force Mirage 2000H.]]
[[File:Sukhoi3.JPG|thumb|right|IAF [[Sukhoi Su-30 MKI]]]]
India currently has [[fourth generation jet fighter]]s capable of launching nuclear weapons. Nuclear-capable aircraft are also seen as a less expensive way of dropping nuclear warheads as well as being as effective.  . 

*'''Fighter jets'''
The [[Sukhoi Su-30MKI]],<ref name="janes.com">[http://www.janes.com/defence/air_forces/news/jawa/jawa010108_1_n.shtml ]{{dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref> [[Dassault Mirage 2000]],<ref>[[Mirage 2000#Operational|history]]</ref> and [[MiG-29]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/india/aircraft/index.html |title=India Aircraft Special Weapons Delivery Systems |publisher=Fas.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref> serve in the Indian Air Force and are also seen as a means to deliver nuclear weapons. In addition India maintains [[SEPECAT Jaguar]] and [[MiG-27]]M which can be used to drop gravity bombs. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdi.org/issues/nukef&f/database/innukes.html |title=CDI Nuclear Issues Area - Nuclear Weapons Database: French Nuclear Delivery Systems |publisher=Cdi.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref>  On the other hand, the Su-30MKI is capable of carrying nuclear weapons and is tailor-made for Indian specifications. <ref name="janes.com"/> It is primarily an air superiority fighter with air-to-ground attack capabilities. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-6809147_ITM |title=Article: The year of the MiG-29: in 2001, RAC Mig had its best year in the... &#124; AccessMyLibrary - Promoting library advocacy |publisher=AccessMyLibrary |date=2002-03-01 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref> The MKI variant features several improvements over the basic K and MK variants and is classified as a [[Fighter aircraft#Generation 4.5 jet fighters (late 1990s to the present)|4.5 generation fighter]]. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050511/asp/opinion/story_4721233.asp |title=The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date=2005-05-11 |accessdate=2010-08-31 |location=Calcutta, India}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deagel.com/Strike-and-Fighter-Aircraft/Su-30MKI_a000320007.aspx |title=Su-30MKI |publisher=Deagel.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-31}}</ref> Due to similar features and components, the MKI variant is often considered to be a customized Indian variant of the [[Sukhoi Su-35]].  . 

The Mirage 2000Hs were heavily customised during the Kargil War and is the only other version, other than the French 2000N, to be able to be armed with nuclear weapons.  . 

Though the [[MiG-29]] like the [[HAL Tejas]] after many test flights have not been tested to use nuclear weapons, they have the capacity to be armed with them. Both the HAL Tejas and Su-30MKI can travel excess of 3,000&nbsp;km without refueling; this allows India to attack targets far away in an effective manner only using planes rather than delivery systems such as the Agni. The HAL Tejas is India's only indigenous plane to be armed with nuclear weapons, thus making India less dependent on Russia.  . 

India has leased four Russian Tupolev Tu-22M3 bombers, which could carry air-launched cruise missiles. India has reportedly upgraded its Russian-built Tu-142 maritime patrol aircraft to carry air-launched cruise missiles. <ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/india/aircraft.htm |title=India Aircraft Special Weapons Delivery Systems |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref>
India is expected to buy up to 200 Sukhoi PAK-FA stealth fighter jets, developed jointly by Russia and India. <ref>{{cite news|title=Russia shows off Sukhoi T-50 stealth fighter|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14564311|accessdate=20 November 2011|newspaper=BBC|date=17 August 2011}}</ref> . 

==Ballistic missile defense==. 
[[File:AAD Test Crop.jpg|thumb|India's [[Indian Ballistic Missile Defense Program|Advanced Air Defense]] (AAD) interceptor missile]]
{{Main|Indian Ballistic Missile Defense Program}}
India has an active ABM development effort using indigenously developed and integrated radars and locally designed missiles. <ref>[http://www.defensenews.com/aero/story.php?id=2524130 Interview: Vijay Kumar Saraswat Chief Controller of Research and Development, India’s DRDO]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> In November 2006, India successfully conducted the [[Indian Ballistic Missile Defense Program#Prithvi Air Defense Excercise|PADE (Prithvi Air Defence Exercise)]] in which an Anti-ballistic missile, called the [[Indian Ballistic Missile Defense Program#Prithvi Air Defence (PAD)|Prithvi Air Defense (PAD)]] an ''Exoatmospheric'' (outside the atmosphere) interceptor system intercepted a Prithvi-II ballistic missile. The PAD missile has the secondary stage of the Prithvi missile and can reach altitude of 80&nbsp;km. During the test the target missile was intercepted at an 50&nbsp;km altitude. <ref>[http://mod.nic.in/samachar/dec15-06/h1.htm Prithvi Mission Milestone in Missile Defence]. </ref> India became the fourth nation in the world to acquire such a capability and the third nation to develop it through indigenous effort. <ref>Outlook India. [http://www.outlookindia.com/pti_news.asp?id=432771 India develops new anti-missile system]. 27 November 2006. </ref> On 6 December 2007 the [[Indian Ballistic Missile Defense Program#Advanced Air Defence (AAD)|Advanced Air Defence (AAD)]] missile system was tested successfully. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=33815 |title=INDIA successfully conducts interceptor supersonic missile test |publisher=Pib.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2010-08-31}}</ref> This missile is an Endo atmospheric interceptor with an altitude of 30&nbsp;km. According to scientist V K Saraswat of [[DRDO]] the missiles will work in tandem to ensure a hit probability of 99.8 percent. <ref>{{cite news|author=Rajat Pandit, TNN, 26 November 2007, 02:43am IST |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India_on_way_to_joining_exclusive_BMD_club/rssarticleshow/2570683.cms |title=India on way to joining exclusive BMD club |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2007-11-26 |accessdate=2010-08-31}}</ref> Induction of the system into services is expected to be in 2010. Two new anti ballistic missiles that can intercept IRBM/ICBMs are being developed. These high speed missiles (AD-1 and AD-2) are being developed to intercept ballistic missiles with the range of 5,000&nbsp;km. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/008200801071858.htm |title=India to develop high speed interceptors |publisher=Hindu.com |date=2008-01-07 |accessdate=2010-08-31 |location=Chennai, India}}</ref> . 

India also has Russian [[S-300 (missile)|S300]] PMU-2 and it is used as an interceptor for [[ballistic missile]]s. An indigenous nuclear tipped surface to air missile, [[Akash Missile]] is used to destroy low range missiles and is capable of destroying various targets and is one of the few of its kind systems in the world. India has also shown interest in the Russian [[S-400]], the most advanced anti-ballistic missile.  . 

==Chemical weapons==. 
In 1992 India signed the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), stating that it did not have chemical weapons and the capacity or capability to manufacture chemical weapons. By doing this India became one of the original signatories of the Chemical Weapons Convention [CWC] in 1993,<ref>[http://www.opcw.org/about-opcw/member-states/status-of-participation-in-the-cwc/?tx_damfrontend_pi1[pointer&#93;=49]</ref> and ratified it on 2 September 1996. According to India's ex-Army Chief General Sunderji, a country having the capability of making nuclear weapons does not need to have chemical weapons, since the dread of chemical weapons could be created only in those countries that do not have nuclear weapons. Others suggested that the fact that India has found chemical weapons dispensable highlighted its confidence in the conventional weapons system at its command.  . 

In June 1997, India declared its stock of chemical weapons (stockpile of 1044 tonnes of sulphur mustard). <ref>[http://www.dominicantoday.com/dr/world/2007/12/30/26543/India-to-destroy-chemical-weapons-stockpile-by-2009 Dominican Today - India to destroy chemical weapons stockpile by 2009]</ref><ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-3987660.html India declares its stock of chemical weapons]</ref> By the end of 2006, India had destroyed more than 75 percent of its chemical weapons/material stockpile and was granted extension for destroying (the remaining stocks by April 2009) and was expected to achieve 100 percent destruction within that timeframe. <ref>[http://www.dominicantoday.com/dr/world/2007/12/30/26543/India-to-destroy-chemical-weapons-stockpile-by-2009 Dominican Today - India to destroy chemical weapons stockpile by 2009]</ref> India informed the United Nations in May, 2009 that it had destroyed its stockpile of chemical weapons in compliance with the international Chemical Weapons Convention. With this India has become third country after South Korea and Albania to do so. <ref>[http://zeenews.india.com/news531700.html Zee News - India destroys its chemical weapons stockpile]</ref><ref name="in.news.yahoo.com">[http://in.news.yahoo.com/43/20090514/812/tnl-india-destroys-its-chemical-weapons.html ]{{dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref> This was cross-checked by inspectors of the United Nations.  . 

India has an advanced commercial chemical industry, and produces the bulk of its own chemicals for domestic consumption. It is also widely acknowledged that India has an extensive civilian chemical and pharmaceutical industry and annually exports considerable quantities of chemicals to countries such as the United Kingdom, United States, and Taiwan. <ref name="nti.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/india/chemical/index.html |title=Research Library: Country Profiles: India Biological Chronology |publisher=NTI |date= |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref> . 

==Biological warfare==. 
India has a well-developed [[biotechnology]] infrastructure that includes numerous pharmaceutical production facilities bio-containment laboratories (including BSL-3 and BSL-4) for working with lethal [[pathogens]]. It also has highly qualified scientists with expertise in infectious diseases. Some of India’s facilities are being used to support research and development for BW defense purposes. India has ratified the BWC and pledges to abide by its obligations. There is no clear evidence, circumstantial or otherwise, that directly points toward an offensive BW program. New Delhi does possess the scientific capability and infrastructure to launch an offensive BW program, but has chosen not to do so. In terms of delivery, India also possesses the capability to produce aerosols and has numerous potential delivery systems ranging from crop dusters to sophisticated ballistic missiles. <ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|url=http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/india/biological/index.html |title=Research Library: Country Profiles: India Biological Chronology |publisher=NTI |date= |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref> . 

No information exists in the public domain suggesting interest by the Indian government in delivery of biological agents by these or any other means. To reiterate the latter point, in October 2002, Indian President [[A.P.J. Abdul Kalam]] asserted that "we [India] will not make biological weapons. It is cruel to human beings..."<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
==Nuclear weapons==. 
India has greatly developed nuclear weapons after 2005 and excelled in all paths of great weoponry and can be said 6 th most powerful nation in world after USA,Russia,China,France,Germany or UK or may be India itself.
