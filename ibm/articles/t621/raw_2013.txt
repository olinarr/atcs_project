''International Seminar on Nuclear War and Planetary Emergencies: 29th session''. World Scientific Publishing, 2003. p. 33. </ref> In 2005, Wilson further commented in ''[[The Atlantic]]'': . 

<blockquote>
the Osirak reactor that was bombed by Israel in June of 1981 was explicitly designed by the French engineer Yves Girard to be unsuitable for making bombs.

Elsewhere Wilson has stated that <blockquote>
Many claim that the bombing of the Iraqi Osirak reactor delayed Iraq's nuclear bomb program. But the Iraqi nuclear program before 1981 was peaceful, and the Osirak reactor was not only unsuited to making bombs but was under intensive safeguards. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.accuracy.org/newsrelease.php?articleId=1242 | title = Myth: Israel's Strike on Iraqi Reactor Hindered Iraqi Nukes | accessdate = 29 November 2010 | date = 16 March 2006 | publisher = [[Institute for Public Accuracy]] }}</ref>
</blockquote> . 

Iraq was a signatory to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]], placing its reactors under [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) safeguards. <ref name=perl40/> In October 1981, the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]'' published excerpts from the testimony of Roger Richter, a former IAEA inspector who described the weaknesses of the agency's nuclear safeguards to the [[United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee]]. Richter testified that only part of Iraq's nuclear installation was under safeguard and that the most sensitive facilities were not even subject to safeguards. <ref name=bulletin1>{{cite journal |year=1991 |title=10 years ago in the Bulletin |journal=The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |volume=47 |issue=8 |page=5 |publisher=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science, Inc. |url=http://books.google.se/books?id=jQwAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA5&dq=osirak+safeguards+npt&hl=sv&ei=nSb1TLzCH4nvsgaa4ujYBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CD8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=30 November 2010 }}</ref> IAEA's Director-General [[Sigvard Eklund]] issued a rebuttal saying that Richter had never inspected ''Osirak'' and had never been assigned to inspect facilities in the Middle East. <ref name=bulletin1/> Eklund claimed that the safeguards procedures were effective and that they were supplemented by precautionary measures taken by the nuclear suppliers. <ref name=bulletin1/> Anthony Fainberg, a physicist at the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], disputed Richter's claim that a fuel processing program for the manufacturing of nuclear weapons could have been conducted secretly. <ref name=bulletin1/> Fainberg wrote that there was barely enough fuel on the site to make one bomb, and that the presence of hundreds of foreign technicians would have made it impossible for the Iraqis to take the necessary steps without being discovered. <ref name=fainberg>{{cite journal|author=Anthony Fainberg |year=1981 |title=Osirak and international security |journal=The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |volume=37 |issue=8 |pages=33–36|publisher=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science, Inc. |url=http://books.google.se/books?id=PQsAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA33&dq=nuclear+fuel+osirak&hl=sv&ei=tK_0TKaPFY7oOdP-iKsI&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=nuclear%20fuel%20osirak&f=false|accessdate=30 November 2010 }}</ref> . 

==Strategy and diplomacy==. 
In Israel, discussions on which strategy to adopt in response to the Iraqi reactor development were taking place as early as [[Yitzhak Rabin|Yitzhak Rabin's]] [[Seventeenth government of Israel|first term in office]] (1974–1977). <ref name=perl67>Perlmutter, p. 67</ref> Reportedly, planning and training for the operation began during this time. <ref name=perl67/> After [[Menachem Begin]] became Prime Minister in 1977 the preparations intensified; Begin authorized the building of a full-scale model of the Iraqi reactor which Israeli pilots could practice bombing. <ref name=simons>Simons, Geoff ''Iraq: From Sumer to Saddam''. St. Martin's Press, 1996. p. 320. </ref> Three Israeli pilots died in accidents while training for the mission. <ref name=solis /> . 

Israel's Foreign Minister [[Moshe Dayan]] initiated diplomatic negotiations with France, Italy—Israel maintained that some Italian firms acted as suppliers and sub-contractors—and the United States over the matter, but failed to obtain assurances that the reactor program would be halted, and was not able to convince the French governments of [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] and [[François Mitterrand]] to cease aiding the Iraqi nuclear program. <ref>Arye Naor, 2003. "Analysis of the Decision-Making Process," ''Israel’s Strike Against the Iraqi Nuclear Reactor 7 June 1981''. Jerusalem: [[Menachem Begin Heritage Center]]. p. 26. </ref> [[Saddam Hussein]] consistently maintained that ''Osirak'' was intended for peaceful purposes. <ref>Sciolino, Elaine. ''The Outlaw State: Saddam Hussein's Quest for Power and the War in the Gulf''. John Wiley & Sons Inc. (1 ed.), 1991. p. 152. </ref> Begin considered the diplomatic options fruitless, and worried that prolonging the decision to attack would lead to a fatal inability to act in response to the perceived threat. <ref name=council /> According to Karl P. Mueller, in the spring of 1979, Begin had reached the conclusion that an anticipatory attack was necessary. <ref name=mueller>{{cite book|last=Mueller|first=Karl P.|title=Striking First: Preemptive and Preventive Attack in U.S. National Security Policy|year=2007|publisher=RAND Corporation|url=http://books.google.se/books?id=qg3JDl_zdqcC&pg=PA215&dq=osirak+dayan&hl=sv&ei=IxcDTtt4x86yBqL3uIUO&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=osirak%20dayan&f=false|accessdate=23 June 2011|page=215}}</ref> . 

[[Anthony Cordesman]] writes that Israel conducted a series of clandestine operations to halt construction or destroy the reactor. <ref name=cordes606>Cordesman, p. 606. </ref> In April 1979, Israeli agents in France allegedly planted a bomb that destroyed the reactor's first set of core structures while they were awaiting shipment to Iraq. <ref name=cordes606/> In June 1980, Israeli agents are said to have assassinated [[Yehia El-Mashad]], an Egyptian atomic scientist working on the Iraqi nuclear program. <ref name=styan>Styan, David. ''France and Iraq: Oil, Arms and French Policy Making in the Middle East''. I.B. Tauris, 2006. p. 134. </ref><ref name=hurst/> It has also been claimed that Israel bombed several of the French and Italian companies it suspected of working on the project, and sent threatening letters to top officials and technicians. <ref name=cordes606/><ref name=hurst>Hurst, Steven.

===Iranian attack===. 
Iran [[Iranian Air Force in Iran-Iraq war|attacked]] and damaged the site on September 30, 1980, with two [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantoms]], shortly after the outbreak of the [[Iran-Iraq War]]. <ref name=airenthusiast /> At the onset of the war, [[Yehoshua Saguy]], director of the Israeli [[Military Intelligence Directorate (Israel)|Military Intelligence Directorate]], publicly urged the Iranians to bomb the reactor. <ref name=airenthusiast>{{cite journal |author=Tom Cooper and Farzad Bishop|year=2004 |title=Target: Saddam's Reactor; Israeli and Iranian Operations against Iraqi Plans to Develop Nuclear Weapons |journal=Air Enthusiast |publisher=Key Publishing|issue=110|url=http://www.angelfire.com/art2/narod/opera/}}</ref><ref name=note39>{{cite web|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/mcnair41/41not.htm#39 |title=McNair Paper 41, Radical Responses to Radical Regimes: Evaluating Preemptive Counter-Proliferation, May 1995, note 39 |publisher=Au.af.mil |date= |accessdate=2011-06-19}}</ref> This was the first attack on a [[nuclear reactor]] and only the third on a nuclear facility in the history of the world.

[[Trita Parsi]], in the book  ''Treacherous Alliance: The Secret Dealings of Israel, Iran, and the United States'', writes that a senior Israeli official met with a representative of the [[Ayatollah Khomeini|Khomeini regime]] in France one month prior to the Israeli attack. <ref name=parsi>Parsi, Trita. ''Treacherous Alliance: The Secret Dealings of Israel, Iran, and the United States''. Yale University Press (1 ed.), 2007. p. 107. </ref> The source of the assertion is [[Ari Ben-Menashe]], a former Israeli government employee. At the alleged meeting, the Iranians explained details of their 1980 attack on the site, and agreed to let Israeli planes land at an Iranian airfield in [[Tabriz]] in the case of an emergency. <ref name=parsi/> . 

===Operational planning===. 
The distance between Israeli military bases and the reactor site was significant—over {{convert|1600|km|mi|abbr=on}}. <ref>Seale, Patrick. ''Asad: The Struggle for the Middle East''. University of California Press, 1990. p. 370. </ref> The Israeli planes would have to violate [[Jordan]]ian and/or [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] airspace in a covert flight over foreign territory, making [[aerial refueling|mid-air refueling]] unfeasible. <ref name=solis/><ref name=raas /><ref>Abbey, Alan D. ''Journey of Hope: The Story of Ilan Ramon, Israel's First Astronaut''. Geffen Publishing House, 2003. p. 11. </ref> The Israelis eventually concluded that a squadron of heavily fueled and heavily armed [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16A]]s, with a group of [[F-15 Eagle|F-15A]]s to provide air cover and fighter support, could perform a [[surgical strike]] to eliminate the reactor site without having to refuel. <ref name=eitan /> . 

The decision to go through with the operation was hotly contested within Begin's government. <ref name=options/> [[Ariel Sharon]], a member of the [[Security Cabinet of Israel|Security Cabinet]], later said that he was among those who advocated bombing the reactor. <ref>Dan, Uri. ''Ariel Sharon: An Intimate Portrait''. Palgrave McMillan, 2007. p. 81. </ref> Dayan, Defense Minister (until late 1980) [[Ezer Weizman]] and Deputy Prime Minister [[Yigael Yadin]] were among those opposed. <ref name=mueller /> According to Mueller, "the principal difference between the hawks and doves on this issue lay in their estimation of the likely international political costs of an air strike". <ref name=mueller /> Shai Feldman specifies that "[those opposed] feared that the operation would derail the fragile Israeli-Egyptian peace process, fuel Arab anxieties about Israel's  profile in the region, and damage Israel-French relations". <ref>Feldman, Shai. ''Nuclear Weapons and Arms Control in the Middle East''. MIT Press, 1997. p. 110. </ref> Begin and his supporters, including Sharon, were far less pessimistic than their opponents about the political fallout. <ref name=mueller/> [[Yehoshua Saguy]] argued for continued efforts in trying to find a non-military solution as it would take the Iraqis five to ten years to produce the material necessary for a nuclear weapon. <ref name=options>{{cite web |url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/npp/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&id=17922 |title=No Military Options |author=[[Joseph Cirincione]] |date=January 19, 2006 |work=Proliferation Analysis |publisher=[[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] |accessdate=1 December 2010}}</ref> In the end, Begin chose to order the attack based on a worst-case estimate where a weapon could be created in one to two years time. <ref name=options/> . 

It has been claimed that Israel felt it necessary to destroy the reactor before it was loaded with nuclear fuel, in order to prevent [[radioactive contamination]]. <ref name=shlomo/> An analysis by Warren Donnelly of the United States [[Congressional Research Service]] concluded that "it would be most unlikely for an attack with conventional bombs upon the reactor when operating to have caused lethal exposures to radioactivity in Baghdad, although some people at the reactor site might receive some exposure". <ref>{{cite journal|author=Anthony Fainberg |year=1981 |title=Osirak and international security |journal=The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |volume=37 |issue=7 |page=12|publisher=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science, Inc. |url=http://books.google.se/books?id=TAoAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA11&dq=osirak+radioactivity&hl=sv&ei=8nD2TLIzivayBtCT3OME&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&sqi=2&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=osirak%20radioactivity&f=false|accessdate=30 November 2010 }}</ref> .

==The attack==.

[[Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations|Yehuda Blum]], in a speech to the [[United Nations Security Council]] following the attack, claimed that the operation was launched on a Sunday afternoon under the assumption that workers present on the site, including foreign experts employed at the reactor, would have left. <ref name=scott132/> Notwithstanding this precaution, there were hundreds of French workers and other nationals at the plant at the time of the raid. <ref name=simons /> . 

The attack squadron consisted of eight [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16A]]s, each with two unguided [[Mark 84 bomb|Mark-84]] 2,000-pound [[delay-action bomb]]s. <ref name=raas /> A flight of six [[F-15 Eagle|F-15A]]s was assigned to the operation to provide fighter support. <ref name=solis /> The F-16 pilots were [[Ze'ev Raz]] (who was later decorated by the Chief of Staff for his leadership), [[Amos Yadlin]], [[Dobbi Yaffe]], [[Hagai Katz]], [[Amir Nachumi]], [[Iftach Spector]], [[Relik Shafir]], and [[Ilan Ramon]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iafe.net/ma/pdf/opera.pdf|title=Operation Opera|first=Tzahi|last=Ben-Ami|language=Hebrew|accessdate=August 28, 2010}}</ref> . 

On June 7, 1981, at 15:55 local time (12:55 [[GMT]]), the operation was initiated. The Israeli planes left [[Taba International Airport|Etzion Airbase]], flying unchallenged in [[Jordan]]ian and [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] airspace. <ref name=eitan>Rafael Eitan, 2003. "The Raid on the Reactor from the Point of View of the Chief of Staff," ''Israel’s Strike Against the Iraqi Nuclear Reactor 7 June 1981''. Jerusalem: [[Menachem Begin Heritage Center]]</ref> To avoid detection, the Israeli pilots conversed in Saudi-accented Arabic while in Jordanian airspace and told Jordanian air controllers that they were a Saudi patrol that had gone off course. <ref name=simons /> While flying over Saudi Arabia, they pretended to be Jordanians, using Jordanian radio signals and formations. <ref name=simons /><ref>Trevor Dupuy, Paul Martell. ''Flawed Victory: Arab-Israeli Conflict and the 1982 War in Lebanon''. Hero Books, 1986. p. 69. </ref>  The Israeli planes were so heavily loaded that the external fuel tanks that had been mounted on the planes were exhausted in-flight. The tanks were jettisoned over the [[Nefud|Saudi desert]]. <ref name=eitan /> . 

En route to the target, the Israeli planes crossed the [[gulf of Aqaba]]. Unknowingly, the squadron flew directly over the yacht of [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]] of Jordan, who was vacationing in the Gulf at the time. <ref name=zeev /> Taking into account the location, heading, and armament of the Israeli planes, Hussein quickly deduced the Iraqi reactor to be the most probable target. Hussein immediately contacted his government and ordered a warning to be sent to the Iraqis. However, due to a communication failure the message was never received and the Israeli planes entered Iraqi air space undetected. <ref name=eitan /> . 

Upon reaching Iraqi airspace the squadron split up, with two of the F-15s forming close escort to the F-16 squadron, and the remaining F-15s dispersing into Iraqi airspace as a diversion and ready back-up.

At 18:35 local time (14:35 [[GMT]]), 20&nbsp;km from the ''Osirak'' reactor complex, the F-16 formation climbed to 2,100 m and went into a 35-degree dive at 1,100&nbsp;km/h, aimed at the reactor complex. At 1,100 m, the F-16s began releasing the [[Mark 84 bomb]]s in pairs, at 5-second intervals. <ref name=eitan /> At least eight of the sixteen released bombs struck the containment dome of the reactor. <ref name=raas /> It was later revealed that half an hour before the Israeli planes arrived, a group of Iraqi soldiers manning anti-aircraft defenses had left their posts for an afternoon meal, turning off their radars. <ref name=solis /> The Israeli planes were still intercepted by Iraqi defenses but managed to evade the remaining anti-aircraft fire. <ref name=solis /> The squadron climbed to high altitude and started their return to [[Israel]].

==International political reactions==. 
{{See also|United Nations Security Council Resolution 487}}
[[File:F-16netz002.jpg|thumb|IAF F-16A ''Netz'' with Osirak bombing mark.]] . 

International response at the [[United Nations]] took two paths. The [[United Nations Security Council]] issued a unanimous and almost immediate response on June 19, 1981, following eight meetings and statements from Iraq and the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]. Security Council Resolution 487<ref name=scres>{{cite web|url=http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/6c57312cc8bd93ca852560df00653995?OpenDocument |title=S-RES-487(1981) Security Council Resolution 487 (1981) |publisher=Domino.un.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-19}}</ref> strongly condemned the attack as a "clear violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of international conduct" and called on Israel to refrain from such attacks in the future; the Council recognised the right of Iraq to "establish programmes of technological and nuclear development" and called for Israel to join Iraq within the "IAEA safeguards regime" of the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]]. <ref name="UN_SRES4871981">{{UN document|docid=S-RES-487(1981) |type=Resolution |body=Security Council |year=1981 |accessdate=2007-08-10 |date=19 June 1981}}</ref>  The Council also stated its consideration that Iraq was "entitled to appropriate redress for the destruction it has suffered." The United States voted for the resolution and suspended the delivery of four F-16 aircraft to Israel, but blocked punitive action by the UN. <ref name=seliktar>Seliktar, Ofira.

The [[UN General Assembly]] followed the Security Council with Resolution No. 36/27 on November 13, 1981, expressing deep alarm and condemning Israel over the "premeditated and unprecedented act of aggression," and demanding that Israel pay prompt and adequate compensation for the damage and loss of life it had caused. <ref name="United Nations, p. 283">United Nations Staff, p. 283. </ref> The resolution also solemnly warned Israel to refrain from taking such measures in the future. <ref name="United Nations, p. 283"/> . 

Debate prior to passage of the UN resolution reflected member states' differing positions on issues such as nuclear proliferation in the region and the appropriateness and justifiability of Israel's actions. The Iraqi representative stated that "the motives behind the Israeli attack were to cover up Israel's possession of nuclear weapons and, more importantly, the determination not to allow the Arab nation to acquire scientific or technical knowledge."<ref name=un277/> Syria requested condemnation not only of Israel for terrorism against Arab peoples, but also of the United States, "which continue[s] to provide Israel with instruments of destruction as part of its strategic alliance."<ref>United Nations Staff, p. 281. </ref> . 

The representative of France stated that the sole purpose of the reactor was scientific research. <ref name=un277/> Agreements between France and Iraq excluded military use. <ref name=un277/> The United Kingdom said it did not believe Iraq had the capacity to manufacture fissionable materials for nuclear weapons. <ref name=un277/> The IAEA Director-General confirmed that inspections of the nuclear research reactors near Baghdad revealed no non-compliance with the safeguards agreement. <ref name=un277/> . 

The IAEA's [[Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency|Board of Governors]] convened on June 9–12 and condemned Israel's action. <ref name=louka>{{cite web |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/23531554/Elli-Louka-Nuclear-Weapons-Proliferation |title=Precautionary Self-Defense: Preempting Nuclear Proliferation |author=Eli Louka |year=2009 |work=Nuclear weapons non-proliferation |page=9 |accessdate=2 December 2010}}</ref> The Board further asked that the prospect of suspending Israel's privileges and rights of membership be considered at the next General Conference held by the organization. <ref name=louka/> On September 26, 1981, the IAEA Conference condemned the attack and voted to suspend all technical assistance to Israel. <ref name=louka/> A draft resolution was introduced to expel Israel from the IAEA, but the proposition was defeated. <ref name=louka/> The United States argued that the attack was not a violation of the IAEA Statute and that punitive action against Israel would do great harm to the IAEA and the non-proliferation regime. <ref name=louka/> . 

The attack was strongly criticized around the world, including in the United States. <ref name=seliktar /><ref>Nyamuya Maogoto, Jackson. ''Battling Terrorism: Legal Perspectives On The Use Of Force And The War On Terror''. Ashgate Publishing, 2005. p. 35. </ref> [[Jonathan Steele]], writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', described the reaction: . 

:"The world was outraged by Israel’s raid on June 7, 1981. “Armed attack in such circumstances cannot be justified. It represents a grave breach of international law,” Margaret Thatcher thundered. Jeane Kirkpatrick, the US ambassador to the UN and as stern a lecturer as Britain’s then prime minister, described it as “shocking” and compared it to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. American newspapers were as fulsome. “Israel’s sneak attack...was an act of inexcusable and short-sighted aggression,” said the New York Times. The Los Angeles Times called it “state-sponsored terrorism”."<ref name=steele>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2002/jun/07/britainand911.usa |title=The Bush doctrine makes nonsense of the UN charter |author=Jonathan Steele |date=June 7, 2002 |publisher=''The Guardian'' |accessdate=29 November 2010}}</ref> .

===Aftermath===. 
Ten Iraqi soldiers and one French civilian were killed in the attack. <ref name=polakow/> The civilian killed was engineer Damien Chaussepied, variously described as 24 or 25 years old, who was an employee of [[Air Liquide]] and the French governmental agency [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique|CEA]]. <ref>Styan, p. 137. </ref><ref>Cooper, H.

The attack took place approximately three weeks before the [[Israeli legislative election, 1981|Israeli legislative election of 1981]]. Opposition leader [[Shimon Peres]] criticized the operation as a political ploy, which did not go over well with the electorate. <ref name=perry>Perry, Dan. ''Israel and the Quest for Permanence''. McFarland & Co Inc., 1999. p. 46. </ref> Dan Perry writes that "the ''Osirak'' bombing - and Peres's poor political judgement in criticizing it - were crucial in turning the tide of what initially had seemed to be a hopeless election campaign for [[Likud]]". <ref name=perry/> On June 30, Likud was reelected in favor of Peres's [[Alignment (political party)|Alignment]] party, winning by just one seat in the Knesset. <ref name=perry/> . 

In 2009, the Prime Minister of Iraq [[Nouri al-Maliki]] demanded that Israel compensate Iraq for the destruction of the reactor. <ref name=alalam>{{cite web|title=Iraq demands compensation from Israel |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zULTV7MD-UI&feature=player_embedded|work=Al-Alam TV|publisher=Al-Alam News Network|accessdate=7 December 2010|date=6 June 2009}}</ref> An Iraqi official asserted that Iraq's right to redress is supported by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 487|Resolution 487]] adopted by the [[United Nations Security Council]] in response to the attack. <ref name=alalam/> In early 2010, ''[[The Siasat Daily]]'', citing an unnamed Iraqi parliament member, reported that Iraqi officials had received word from the [[UN Secretariat]] that the Iraqi government is entitled to seek compensation from Israel for damage caused by the attack. <ref>{{cite web|title=Iraq pursuing compensation for Israel nuke attack|url=http://www.siasat.com/english/news/iraq-pursuing-compensation-israel-nuke-attack|work=The Siasat Daily|accessdate=7 December 2010|date=6 January|year=2010}}</ref> . 

==Assessment==. 
Israel claims that the attack impeded Iraq's nuclear ambitions by at least ten years. <ref name=council>[[Council of Europe]]. Parliamentary Assembly - Working papers - 2007 Ordinary Session (Third part) 25–29 June 2007 - Volume V (2008). p. 178. </ref> In an interview in 2005, [[Bill Clinton]] expressed support for the attack: "everybody talks about what the Israelis did at Osiraq, in 1981, which, I think, in retrospect, was a really good thing. You know, it kept Saddam from developing nuclear power."<ref name="Davos2005">{{cite web |url=http://www.clintonfoundation.org/news/news-media/012705-cf-ee-cgi-usa-che-ts-interview-at-the-world-economic-forum |title=Transcript: Interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos |date=27 January 2005 |publisher=The Clinton Foundation |accessdate=13 March 2012}} Viewable on [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLqEQyyVNzI&t=1658 YouTube] at 27:38. </ref> . 

In 2010, squad leader Ze'ev Raz said of the operation: "There was no doubt in the mind of the decision makers that we couldn't take a chance. We knew that the Iraqis could do exactly what we did in [[Negev Nuclear Research Center|Dimona]]."<ref>{{cite web|title=Zeev Raz|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KRwyPP0hso|work=Interview with Ze'ev Raz|publisher=[[Leadel.net]]|accessdate=24 January 2011}}</ref>   . 

As early as the autumn of 1981, [[Kenneth Waltz]] discussed the fallout from the strike:
{{quote|
In striking Iraq, Israel showed that a preventive strike can be made, something that was not in doubt. Israel's act and its consequences however, make clear that the likelihood of useful accomplishment is low. Israel's strike increased the determination of Arabs to produce nuclear weapons. Arab states that may attempt to do so will now be all the more secretive and circumspect. Israel’s strike, far from foreclosing Iraq's nuclear future, gained her the support of some other Arab states in pursuing it. And despite Prime Minister Begin's vow to strike as often as need be, the risks in doing so would rise with each occasion. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Waltz|first=Kenneth|title=The Spread of Nuclear Weapons: More May Be Better|journal=[[Adelphi Papers]]|date=Autumn|year=1981|volume=21|issue=171|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/waltz1.htm|accessdate=10 December 2010|publisher=[[International Institute for Strategic Studies]]|location=London}}</ref>
}}
[[Charles R. H. Tripp]], in an interview for the 25th anniversary of the attack, described the bombing of ''Osirak'' as a variation of Israeli military doctrine beginning with the premiership of [[David Ben-Gurion]], "advocating devastating [[preemptive war|pre-emptive]] strikes on Arab enemies."<ref name=bbc2>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5009212.stm | work=BBC News | title=Osirak: Threats real and imagined| date=5 June 2006 |accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref> Tripp asserted, "the ''Osirak'' attack is an illegal way to behave—Resolution 487 established that—but it is an understandable way to behave if you are the Israeli military-security establishment."<ref name=bbc2/> . 

Tom Moriarty, a military intelligence analyst for the [[United States Air Force]], wrote in 2004 that Israel had "gambled that the strike would be within Iraq's threshold of tolerance." Moriarty argues that Iraq, already in the midst of a [[Iran-Iraq war|war with Iran]], would not start a war with Israel at the same time and that its "threshold of tolerance was higher than normal."<ref name=moriarty>{{cite journal|last=Moriarty |first=Tom|title=Entering the Valley of Uncertainty: The Future of Preemptive Attack|journal=World Affairs|date=Fall 2004|volume=167|issue=2|pages=71–77|jstor=20672710|publisher=World Affairs Institute}}</ref> . 

[[Joseph Cirincione]], then director of non-proliferation at the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], wrote in 2006:
{{quote|
Israel had pulled off a remarkable military raid, striking targets with great precision over long distances. But the bombing set back Israel more than Iraq. It further harmed Israel's international reputation, later worsened by the ill-fated 1982 invasion of Lebanon, while making Iraq appear a victim of Israeli aggression. <ref name=options/>
}}
By contrast, Iraqi researchers have stated that the [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraqi nuclear program]] simply went underground, diversified, and expanded. <ref name=salama>{{cite web|url=http://cns.miis.edu/stories/040812.htm |title=A Preemptive Attack on Iran's Nuclear Facilities: Possible Consequences |author=Sammy Salama and Karen Ruster |date = August 2004|publisher=James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies |accessdate=29 November 2010}}</ref> [[Khidir Hamza]], an Iraqi nuclear scientist, made the following statement in an interview on [[CNN]]'s ''[[Crossfire (TV series)|Crossfire]]'' in 2003:
{{quote|
Israel—actually, what Israel [did] is that it got out the immediate danger out of the way. But it created a much larger danger in the longer range. What happened is that Saddam ordered us—we were 400 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. scientists and technologists running the program. And when they bombed that reactor out, we had also invested $400 million. And the French reactor and the associated plans were from Italy. When they bombed it out we became 7,000 with a $10 billion investment for a secret, much larger underground program to make bomb material by enriching uranium. We dropped the reactor out totally, which was the plutonium for making nuclear weapons, and went directly into enriching uranium... They [Israel] estimated we'd make 7 kg [15 lb] of plutonium a year, which is enough for one bomb. And they get scared and bombed it out. Actually it was much less than this, and it would have taken a much longer time. But the program we built later in secret would make six bombs a year. <ref name=salama/>
}}
Similarly, the Iraqi nuclear scientist Imad Khadduri wrote in 2003 that the bombing of ''Osirak'' convinced the Iraqi leadership to initiate a full-fledged nuclear weapons program. <ref>Khadduri, Imad. ''Iraq's Nuclear Mirage, Memoirs and Delusions''. Springhead Publishers, 2003. p. 82. </ref> United States Secretary of Defense [[William Perry]] stated in 1997 that Iraq refocused its nuclear weapons effort on producing highly enriched uranium after the raid. <ref name=perry/> Its interest in acquiring plutonium as fissile material for weapons continued, but at a lower priority. <ref name=perry>Perry, William J. ''Proliferation: Threat and Response''. DIANE Publishing, 1996. p. 19. </ref> [[Louis René Beres]] wrote in 1995 that "[h]ad it not been for the brilliant raid at Osiraq, Saddam’s forces might have been equipped with atomic warheads in 1991."<ref>Louis Rene Beres and Tsiddon-Chatto, Col. (res.) Yoash, “Reconsidering Israel’s Destruction of Iraq’s Osiraq Nuclear Reactor,” Temple International and Comparative Law Journal 9(2), 1995.

In the Duelfer Report, released by the [[Iraq Survey Group]] in 2004, it is stated that the Iraqi nuclear program "expanded considerably" with the purchase of the French reactor in 1976, and that "Israel’s bombing of Iraq's ''Osirak'' nuclear reactor spurred Saddam to build up Iraq's military to confront Israel in the early 1980s."<ref>{{cite book|last=Duelfer|first=Charles|title=Comprehensive Report of the Special Advisor to the DCI on Iraq's WMD (The Duelfer Report)|pages= 28 and 31|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/general-reports-1/iraq_wmd_2004/chap1.html|accessdate=8 December 2010|chapter=Regime Strategic Incident|date=September 30, 2004}}</ref> . 

[[Bob Woodward]], in the book ''State of Denial'', writes:
{{quote|
Israeli intelligence were convinced that their strike in 1981 on the ''Osirak'' nuclear reactor about 10 miles outside Baghdad had ended Saddam's program.

The destruction of the Osiraq reactor did not delay the development of a nuclear weapons option because it [the reactor] was never intended to be part of such an effort. The French-supplied facility was subject to rigorous safeguards and designed to ensure that Iraq would not be able to produce weapons-grade plutonium. An examination of the reactor by Harvard physicist Richard Wilson after the attack concluded that the facility was not suited for production of weapons-grade plutonium. As a result, the attack did not reduce the risk that Iraq would develop nuclear weapons. On the contrary, it brought about a far more determined and focused effort to acquire nuclear weapons. <ref name="BHegg HuffPo">{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/malfrid-brauthegghammer/can-an-attack-deny-iran-t_b_572162.html |title=Can an Attack Deny Iran the Bomb? |author=Malfrid Braut-Hegghammer |date=11 May 2011 |publisher=The Huffington Post |accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref>}} .
