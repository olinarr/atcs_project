"'''Little Boy'''" was the [[codename]] for the [[atomic bomb]] dropped on [[Hiroshima, Japan|Hiroshima]] on August 6, 1945 by the Boeing [[B-29 Superfortress]] ''[[Enola Gay]]'', piloted by [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Paul Tibbets]] of the [[393rd Bomb Squadron|393rd Bombardment Squadron, Heavy]], of the [[United States Army Air Forces]]. <ref>The name ''Little Boy'' is [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/6/newsid_3602000/3602189.stm alleged on a BBC web site] to be a reference to former President Roosevelt. </ref> It was the first atomic bomb to be used as a weapon.

The weapon was developed by the [[Manhattan Project]] during [[World War II]]. It derived its explosive power from the [[nuclear fission]] of [[uranium 235]]. The [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima bombing]] was the second artificial [[nuclear explosion]] in history, after the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]], and the first [[uranium]]-based detonation. Approximately 600 to 860&nbsp;milligrams of [[matter]] in the bomb <!--do not change to [[mass]] which is incorrect; see TALK--> was converted into the active energy of heat and radiation (see [[mass-energy equivalence]] for detail). It exploded with an energy between {{convert|13|and|18|ktonTNT|lk=in}} (estimates vary). It has been estimated that 130,000 to 150,000 people had died as a result of its use by the end of December 1945. <ref>{{Citation

}}</ref> Its design was not tested in advance, unlike the more complex plutonium bomb ([[Fat Man]]). The available supply of [[enriched uranium]] was very small at that time, and it was felt that the simple design of a uranium "gun" type bomb was so sure to work that there was no need to test it at full scale.  . 

==Naming==. 
The names for all three atomic bomb design projects during WW II ("Fat Man", "Thin Man", and "Little Boy") were allegedly created by [[Robert Serber]], a former student of Los Alamos director [[Robert Oppenheimer]] who worked on the project, according to Serber. According to his later memoirs, he chose them based on their design shapes; the "Thin Man" would be a very long device, and the name came from the [[Dashiell Hammett]] [[The Thin Man|detective novel]] and [[The Thin Man (film)|series of movies]] by the same name; the "Fat Man" bomb would be round and fat and was named after [[Sidney Greenstreet]]'s "Kasper Gutman" character in ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]''. "Little Boy" would come last and be named only to contrast to the "Thin Man" bomb. <ref>Robert Serber, ''Peace & War: Reminiscences of a Life on the Frontiers of Science'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1998): 104. </ref> The original "Thin Man" had been expected to be as long as 17 feet, but when it was discovered that U-235 would require a slower projectile speed than first measurements had indicated, it was realized that the gun-design could be shortened to 6 feet, and this design was named "Little Boy" in contrast. <ref>{{citation |authorlink=Richard Rhodes |last=Rhodes |first=Richard |title=The Making of the Atomic Bomb |location=[[New York, New York]] |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |year=1986 |isbn=0-671-44133-7 |oclc=13793436  p. 541 iu chapter "Revelations"}}</ref> However, in his memoirs, [[Paul Tibbets]], commander of the [[509th Composite Group]] said the code names were part of an Air Force cover story.  According to Tibbets, Project [[Silverplate]], the Air Force program to modify the B-29 to carry atomic bombs, was given the cover story of existing to modify the B-29 into a passenger plane. One plane was allegedly for the use of Winston Churchill, 'the fat man', and the other for Franklin Roosevelt, 'the thin man.'<ref>Tibbets, Paul W. ''The Tibbets' Story''. New York: Stein & Day Publishing, 1982. ISBN 0-81287-057-3. </ref> . 

An extremely large six-ton conventional-explosive bomb developed by the British, operational in mid-1944, had been named the [[Tallboy (bomb)|Tallboy]], at a length of 21&nbsp;ft (6.35m).  . 

==Basic weapon design==. 
{{main|Gun-type fission weapon|Nuclear weapon design}}
[[File:Gun-type fission weapon en-labels thin lines.svg|thumb|The "gun" assembly method. When the hollow [[uranium]] projectile was driven onto the target cylinder, a nuclear explosion resulted.]] . 

The Mk I "Little Boy" was {{convert|120|in|cm}} in length, {{convert|28|in|cm}} in diameter and weighed approximately {{convert|9700|lb|kg}}. <ref name=TFAW/> The design used the [[Gun-type fission weapon|gun method]] to explosively force a hollow sub-[[Critical mass (nuclear)|critical mass]] of [[uranium]]-235 and a solid target cylinder together into a super-critical mass, initiating a [[nuclear chain reaction]]. This was accomplished by shooting one piece of the uranium onto the other by means of chemical explosives. It contained {{convert|64|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of uranium, of which less than a kilogram underwent [[nuclear fission]], and of this mass only {{convert|0.6|g|oz|abbr=on}} was transformed into a different type of energy (initially kinetic energy, then heat and light). <ref><!-- the fissioned U-235 becomes fission fragments which have a lower rest mass, after their kinetic energy has been absorbed and removed-->Glasstone and Dolan, ''Effects'', pp. 12–13. When one pound (454 g) of U-235 undergoes complete fission, the yield is 8 kilotons. The 13-to-16-kiloton yield of the Little Boy bomb was therefore produced by the fission no more than two pounds (907 g) of U-235, out of the 141 pounds (64 kg) in the pit. The remaining 139 pounds (63 kg), 98.5% of the total, contributed nothing to the energy yield. </ref><ref>[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/host/atomic/nukeffct/enw77a.html Chapter I: General Principles of Nuclear Explosions] (Sections 1.15, 1.20, 1.21), in [http://www.cddc.vt.edu/host/atomic/nukeffct/enw77preface.html The Effects of Nuclear Weapons], Compiled and edited by Samuel Glasstone and Philip J. Dolan, Third Edition, on [http://www.cddc.vt.edu/host/atomic/ The Trinity Atomic Website]</ref> (Because [[mass in special relativity|mass is strictly conserved, even in relativity]], the mass that becomes destructive types of energy in atomic bomb explosions always retains its mass, and becomes "missing" only after being removed from the exploded system as heat. <!--The heat then retains this "missing" mass; it's missing only because it has been removed from the system when the fission fragments are cooled down and we measure their "rest mass"-->).  . 

No full test of a gun-type nuclear weapon had occurred before the "Little Boy" device was dropped over [[Hiroshima]]. The only [[nuclear testing|test explosion]] of a nuclear weapon had been of an [[Implosion-type nuclear weapon|implosion-type]] weapon using [[plutonium]] as its fissionable material, on July 16, 1945 at the [[Trinity test]]. There were several reasons for not testing the "Little Boy" device. Primarily, there was little uranium-235 compared with the relatively large amount of plutonium which, it was expected, could be produced by the [[Hanford Site|Hanford]] reactors. Additionally, the weapon design was simple enough that it was only deemed necessary to do laboratory tests with the gun-type assembly (known during the war as [[Louis Slotin#The criticality accident|"tickling the dragon's tail"]]). Unlike the implosion design, which required sophisticated coordination of shaped explosive charges, the gun-type design was considered almost certain to work.  . 

Although occasionally used in later experimental devices, the design was only used once as a weapon because of the danger of accidental detonation. Little Boy's design was unsafe when compared to modern nuclear weapons, which incorporate safety features to endure various accident scenarios. The main objective of Little Boy was to create a weapon that was absolutely guaranteed to work. Consequently, Little Boy incorporated only basic safety mechanisms, thus an accidental detonation could easily occur during one or more of the following scenarios:
*a crash could drive the hollow "bullet" onto the "target" cylinder resulting in a massive release of radiation, or possibly nuclear detonation. 
*an electrical [[short circuit]] of some sort. 
*the danger of misfire was greater over water. If the force of a crash did not trigger the bomb, water leakage into the system could short it out, possibly leading to detonation. The British [[Red Beard (nuclear weapon)|Red Beard]] nuclear weapon also suffered from this design flaw. 
*furthermore if fallen into water, the uranium halves were subject to a moderator-effect of the liquid. 
*[[Fire]]. 
*[[Lightning]] strike.  . 

===Assembly details===. 
The exact specifications of the "Little Boy" bomb remain [[classified information|classified]] because they could still be used to create a viable nuclear weapon. Even so, many sources have speculated as to the design, relying on limited photographic evidence, interviews with former Manhattan Project personnel, and piecing together information from declassified sources to reconstruct its internal dimensions.  . 

According to the website ''Nuclear Weapon Archive'',<ref name=nukearchive>Much of this account is taken from the description of the "Little Boy" by Carey Sublette in Section 8 of his "[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq8.html Nuclear Weapons Frequently Asked Questions]". </ref><ref name=atombombs>The most recent updates come from John Coster-Mullen's ''Atom Bombs: The Top Secret Inside Story of Little Boy and Fat Man'', 2003 (first printed in 1996), a self-published account based largely on oral histories but which contains, in its extensive appendix, a declassified U.S. government document detailing the exact mass and configuration of the U-235 rings. </ref> inside the weapon, the uranium-235 material was divided into two parts, following the gun principle: the "projectile" and the "target". The projectile was a hollow cylinder with 60% of the total mass ({{convert|38.5|kg|lb|abbr=on|disp=/}}). It consisted of a stack of 9 uranium rings, each {{convert|6.25|in|mm|adj=mid. |-diameter}} with a {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=mid. |-diameter}} hole in the center and a total length of {{convert|7|in|mm}}, pressed together into the front end of a thin-walled projectile {{convert|16.25|in|mm}} long. Filling in the remainder of the space behind these rings in the projectile was a [[tungsten carbide]] disc and a steel back. At detonation, the projectile was pushed {{convert|42|in|mm}} down a {{convert|72|in|mm|adj=mid. |-long}}, {{convert|6.5|in|mm|adj=on}} smooth-bore gun barrel. The target "insert" was a {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=mid. |-diameter}} cylinder, {{convert|7|in|mm|adj=on}} long with a {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=mid. |-diameter}} hole in the center comprising 40% of the total mass ({{convert|25.6|kg|lb|abbr=on|disp=/}}). This insert was composed of a stack of 6 washer-like uranium discs somewhat thicker than the projectile rings that were slid over a {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=mid. |-diameter}} rod. This rod then extended forward through the tungsten carbide tamper plug, impact-absorbing anvil, and nose plug backstop eventually protruding out the front of the bomb casing. This entire target assembly was secured at both ends with locknuts.  . 

When the hollow-front projectile reached the target and slid over the target insert, the assembled super-critical mass of uranium would be completely surrounded by a tamper and neutron reflector of tungsten carbide and steel, both materials having a combined mass of {{convert|2300|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. <ref>{{cite book|title=Nuclear Weapons: What You Need to Know|author=Jeremy Bernstein|date=October 15, 2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=052188408X|page=133|quote=a 2,300 kilogram mixture of tungsten carbide and steel was used}}</ref>  Neutron generators at the base of the projectile would be activated by the impact.  . 

The "L-11" combat Little Boy and the assembled projectile containing the U-235 rings were delivered to [[Tinian]] Island on July 26, 1945, by the USS ''[[USS Indianapolis (CA-35)|Indianapolis]]''.  The six target rings arrived July 28 and 29 on three aircraft. 
Because the ''Enola Gay'' weaponeer [[William Sterling Parsons|"Deak" Parsons]] was concerned about the possibility of an accidental detonation he did not load the four [[cordite]] powder bags into the gun breech until the aircraft was in flight on the mission. Before climbing to high altitude approaching the target, Parsons' assistant, [[Morris R. Jeppson]], removed three safety plugs from  the electrical connection between the internal battery and the firing mechanism. <ref>[[Hiroshima: BBC History of World War II]], [[BBC]] Television/Tokyo Broadcasting Inc/Discovery Channel 2005</ref> . 

[[File:Little Boy Internal Components.png|center]] . 

===Counter-intuitive design===. 
For the first fifty years after 1945, every published description and drawing of the Little Boy mechanism assumed that a small, solid projectile was fired into the center of a larger target. <ref name="atombombs"/> However, critical mass considerations{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} dictated that in Little Boy the larger, hollow piece would be the projectile. The assembled fissile core had more than two [[critical mass|critical masses]] of U-235. This required one of the two pieces to have more than one critical mass. A hole in the center of the larger mass dispersed the mass and increased the surface area, allowing more fission neutrons to escape, thus preventing a premature chain reaction.  . 

It was also important for the larger piece to have minimal contact with the neutron-reflecting tungsten carbide tamper until detonation, thus only the projectile's back end was in contact with tungsten carbide (see drawing above). The rest of the tungsten carbide surrounded the sub-critical mass target cylinder (called the "insert" by designers) with air space between it and the insert. This arrangement packs the maximum amount of fissile material into a gun-assembly design. <ref>This information appeared in 2002 in ''Racing for the Bomb'', by Robert S. Norris, Steerforce Press, p. 409, with the 2001 printing of John Coster-Mullen's ''Atom Bombs'', p. 24, cited as its source. </ref> . 

==Development of the bomb==. 
[[File:Oak Ridge Y-12 Alpha Track.jpg|thumb|Uranium for "Little Boy" was enriched in [[calutron]]s (one of these under construction is shown) and by [[gaseous diffusion]] at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]].]]
{{main|Manhattan Project}} . 

The "Little Boy" bomb was constructed through the [[Manhattan Project]] during [[World War II]]. Because enriched uranium was known to be fissionable, it was the first approach to bomb development pursued. The vast majority of the work in constructing "Little Boy" came in the form of the [[isotope enrichment]] of the uranium necessary for the weapon. Enrichment at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] began in February 1943, after many years of research.  . 

The development of the first prototypes and the experimental work started in early 1943, at the time when the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos Design Laboratory]] became operational in the framework of the Manhattan Project. Originally gun-type designs were pursued for both a uranium and plutonium weapon (the "[[Mark 2 nuclear bomb|Thin Man]]" design), but in April 1944 it was discovered that the spontaneous fission rate for plutonium  was too great to use in a gun-type weapon. In July 1944, almost all research at Los Alamos was redirected to the implosion plutonium weapon. In contrast, the uranium bomb was straightforward if not trivial to design.  . 

[[File:Atombombe Little Boy.jpg|thumb|left|As part of [[Project Alberta]], Commander [[Francis Birch (geophysicist)|A. Francis Birch]] (left) numbers the bomb while physicist [[Norman Ramsey]] watches. This is one of the rare photos where the inside of the bomb can be seen.]] . 

With plutonium found unsuitable for the gun-type design, the team working on the gun weapon (led by [[Francis Birch (geophysicist)|A. Francis Birch]]), faced another problem: the bomb was simple, but they lacked the quantity of uranium-235 necessary for its production. Enough fissile material was not going to be available before mid-1945. Despite this, Birch managed to convince others that this concept was worth pursuing, so that in case of a failure of the plutonium bomb, it would still be possible to use the gun principle. In February 1945, the specifications were completed (''model 1850''). The bomb, except for the uranium payload, was ready at the beginning of May 1945.  . 

Most of the uranium necessary for the production of the bomb came from the [[Shinkolobwe]] mine and was made available thanks to the foresight of the CEO of the [[Union Minière du Haut Katanga|High Katanga Mining Union]], [[Edgar Sengier]], who had 1000&nbsp;tons of uranium ore transported to a New York warehouse in 1939. A small amount may have come from a captured German submarine, [[German submarine U-234|U-234]], after the German surrender in May 1945. <ref>Although, responding to a question from Admiral Edwards, General Leslie Groves' 13 August 1945 appointment book entry from the National Archives states, "General advised it wasn't of any help as yet but it will be utilized."</ref> Other sources state that at least part of the 1100 tons of uranium ore and uranium oxide captured by US troops in the second half of April 1945 in [[Stassfurt]], Germany, became <sup>235</sup>U for the bomb. <ref>{{cite book

The majority of the uranium for Little Boy was enriched in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, primarily by means of electromagnetic separation in [[calutron]]s and through [[gaseous diffusion]] plants, with a small amount contributed by the [[cyclotron]]s at [[Ernest O. Lawrence]]'s [[Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory|Radiation Laboratory]]. The core of Little Boy contained 64&nbsp;kg of uranium, of which 50&nbsp;kg was enriched to 88%, and the remaining 14&nbsp;kg at 50%, resulting in an average enrichment of 82.68%.  . 

==Construction and delivery==. 
[[File:Atombombe Little Boy 2.jpg|thumb|Little Boy in the bomb pit on [[Tinian]] island, before being loaded into ''Enola Gay's'' bomb bay. A section of the bomb bay door is visible on the top right]] . 

On July 14, 1945 a train left Los Alamos carrying several <!-- how many?--> "bomb units" (the major non-nuclear parts of a gun-type bomb) together with a single completed uranium projectile; the uranium target was still incomplete. The consignment was delivered to the [[San Francisco Naval Shipyard]] at [[Hunters Point, San Francisco, California|Hunters Point]] in [[San Francisco, California]]. <ref name=nukearchive>Much of this account is taken from the description of the "Little Boy" by Carey Sublette in Section 8 of his "Nuclear Weapons Frequently Asked Questions", available online at http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq8.html. </ref> There, two hours before the successful test of Little Boy's plutonium-implosion brother at the [[Trinity test]] in New Mexico, the bomb units and the projectile were loaded aboard the heavy cruiser [[USS Indianapolis (CA-35)|USS ''Indianapolis'']]. ''Indianapolis'' steamed at record speed to the airbase at [[Tinian]] island in the [[Mariana Islands]], delivering them ten days later on the 26th. (While returning from this mission ''Indianapolis'' was sunk by a Japanese submarine, with great loss of life due to delayed rescue.)  Also on the 26th the three sections of the uranium target assembly were shipped from [[Kirtland Air Force Base]]<ref name="nukearchive"/> near [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] in three [[C-54 Skymaster]] aircraft operated by the [[509th Operations Group|509th Composite Group]]'s Green Hornet squadron. <ref name=losalamos>[http://www.lanl.gov/history/atomicbomb/victory.shtml "Victory"]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}, Los Alamos National Laboratory's history of the atomic bomb project</ref><ref name=airforcehist>[https://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/PopTopics/abomb.htm "The Story of the Atomic Bomb", USAF Historical Studies Office]</ref> With all the necessary components delivered to Tinian, bomb unit L11 was chosen, and the final Little Boy weapon was assembled and ready by August 1. <ref name="nukearchive"/> . 

Handling the completed Little Boy was particularly dangerous. Once [[cordite]] was loaded in the breech, any firing of the explosive would at worst cause a [[nuclear chain reaction]] and at best a contamination of the explosion zone. The mere contact of the two uranium masses could have caused an explosion with dire consequences, from a simple "fizzle" explosion to an explosion large enough to destroy Tinian (including the 500 B-29s based there, and their supporting infrastructure and personnel). Water was also a risk, since it could serve as a [[neutron moderator|moderator]] between the fissile materials and cause a violent dispersal of the nuclear material. The uranium projectile could only be inserted with an apparatus that produced a force of 300,000 newtons (67,000&nbsp;lbf, over 30 tons). For safety reasons, the weaponeer, Captain [[William Sterling Parsons]], decided to load the bags of cordite only after take-off.  . 

=== Fuse system ===. 
The bomb employed a [[Fuse (explosives)|fusing]] system that was designed to detonate the bomb at the most destructive altitude. Calculations showed that for the largest destructive effect, the bomb should explode at an altitude of 580 meters (1,900 feet). The resultant [[fuze]] design was a three-stage interlock system:<ref name=hansen1995part5>{{Citation

*A timer ensured that the bomb would not explode until at least fifteen seconds after release, one-quarter of the predicted fall time, to ensure safety of the aircraft. The timer was activated when the electrical pullout plugs connecting it to the airplane were pulled loose as the bomb fell, switching it to internal (24V battery) power and starting the timer. At the end of the 15 seconds the batteries then powered the radar system and passed responsibility to the barometric stage. <ref name=hansen1995part5 />
*The purpose of the [[barometric]] stage was to delay activating the radar altimeter firing command circuit until near detonation altitude. A thin metallic membrane was gradually deformed as ambient air pressure increased during descent. The barometric fuze was not considered accurate enough to detonate the bomb at the precise ignition height, because air pressure varies with local conditions. When the bomb reached the design height for this stage (reportedly 2,000 meters) the membrane closed a circuit, activating the circuit between the radar altimeters and the projectile gun. The barometric stage was added because of a worry that external radar signals might detonate the bomb too early. <ref name=hansen1995part5 />
*Two or more [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundant]] radar altimeters were used to reliably detect descent. When the altimeters sensed the correct height, the firing switch closed, igniting the three BuOrd Mk15, Mod 1 Navy gun primers in the breech plug, which set off the charge consisting of four silk powder bags each containing two pounds of WM slotted-tube cordite. This launched the uranium projectile towards the opposite end of the gun barrel at an eventual [[muzzle velocity]] of 1000 feet per second (300 meters per second). Approximately 10 milliseconds later the chain reaction occurred, lasting less than 1 μs. The radar altimeters used were modified U.S. Army Air Corps [[Monica tail warning radar|APS-13 fighter tail warning radar]]s, nicknamed "Archie", originally designed to warn a pilot of another plane approaching from behind. <ref name=hansen1995part5 /><ref>Letter dated 7 June 1944 to Maj.

==The bombing of Hiroshima==. 
[[File:Atomic cloud over Hiroshima.jpg|thumb|The [[mushroom cloud]] over [[Hiroshima]] after the dropping of "Little Boy".]] . 

{{main|Enola Gay|atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki}} . 

The bomb was armed in flight {{convert|31000|ft|m}} above the city, then dropped at approximately 08:15&nbsp; (JST) August 6, 1945. After falling for 44.4 seconds, the time and barometric triggers started the firing mechanism. The detonation happened at an altitude of {{convert|1968|ft|m}}. With a yield of 13 to 18&nbsp;[[Ton|kilotons]], it was less powerful than "Fat Man", which was dropped on Nagasaki (21–23&nbsp;kt). The official [[Nuclear weapon yield|yield]] estimate of "Little Boy" was about 16&nbsp;kilotons of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] equivalent in explosive force, i.e. 6.3&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>13</sup> [[joule]]s = 63&nbsp;TJ ([[tera-]]joules). <ref>[http://www.mbe.doe.gov/me70/manhattan/publications/LANLHiroshimaNagasakiYields.pdf Los Alamos National Laboratory report LA-8819]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}, ''The yields of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki nuclear explosions'' by John Malik, September 1985. </ref> However, the damage and the number of victims at Hiroshima were much higher, as Hiroshima was on flat terrain, while the [[hypocenter]] of Nagasaki lay in a small valley.  . 

According to figures published in 1945, 66,000 people were killed as a direct result of the Hiroshima blast, and 69,000 were injured to varying degrees. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/10269571/The-Atomic-Bombings-of-Hiroshima-and-Nagasaki |title=The Atomic Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki |author=The Manhattan Engineer District |date=June 29, 1945 |publisher=[http://www.docstoc.com/ docstoc.com] |work=[[Project Gutenberg]] [[Ebook]]  |page=3}}</ref> . 

The [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]] gives this account of the death toll of the bombing of Hiroshima: . 

{{quote|"By the end of 1945, because of the lingering effects of radioactive fallout and other after effects, the Hiroshima death toll was probably over 100,000.  The five-year death total may have reached or even exceeded 200,000, as cancer and other long-term effects took hold."<ref>"[http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/manhattan/hiroshima.htm The atomic bombing of Hiroshima.]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}" ''[[United States Department of Energy]]''. </ref>}} . 

The success of the bombing was reported with great enthusiasm in the United States in the days following the attacks. See [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] for discussion of contemporary support vs. opposition to the bombings, on both moral and military grounds.  . 

==Physical effects of the bomb==. 
After being selected in April 1945, Hiroshima was spared conventional bombing to serve as a pristine target, where the effects of a nuclear bomb on an undamaged city could be observed. <ref>[[Leslie Groves]], ''Now it Can be Told: The Story of the Manhattan Project'', 1962. In April 1945, General Groves was instructed to pick targets for the nuclear bombs.   Page 267, "To enable us to assess accurately the effects of the bomb, the targets should not have been previously damaged by air raids."  Four cities were chosen, including Hiroshima and Kyoto.  War Secretary Stimson vetoed Kyoto, and Nagasaki was substituted.  Page 275, "When our target cities were first selected, an order was sent to the Army Air Force in Guam not to bomb them without special authority from the War Department."</ref>  While damage could be studied later, the energy yield of the untested Little Boy design could be determined only at the moment of detonation, using instruments dropped by parachute from a plane flying in formation with the one that dropped the bomb. Radio-transmitted data from these instruments indicated a yield of about 15 kilotons.  . 

Comparing this yield to the observed damage produced a rule of thumb called the 5 [[Pounds per square inch|psi]] lethal area rule.  The number of immediate fatalities will approximately equal the number of people inside the lethal area.  . 

The damage came from three main effects: blast, fire, and radiation. <ref>Samuel Glasstone and Philip Dolan, ''The Effects of Nuclear Weapons'', Third Edition, 1977, U.S. Dept of Defense and U.S. Dept of Energy. </ref> . 

===Blast===. 
The blast from a nuclear bomb is the result of [[X-ray]]-heated air (the fireball) sending a shock/pressure wave in all directions at a velocity greater than the speed of sound (aka, the "Mach-Stem"),<ref>{{Citation

Data from the explosion at Nagasaki offers less insight, since hilly terrain deflected the blast and generated a more complicated pattern of destruction.  .

At Hiroshima, severe structural damage to buildings extended about {{convert|1|mi|km}} in radius from [[ground zero]], making a circle of destruction {{convert|2|mi|km}} in diameter. The blast sent out a hyper-intensified [[shock wave]] which travelled at (slightly above) the [[speed of sound]], turning buildings into [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]]. There was little or no structural damage outside of this one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) radius. At one mile (1.6&nbsp;km), the force of the blast wave was 5 psi, with enough duration to implode houses and reduce them to kindling.  . 

Later test explosions of nuclear weapons with houses and other test structures nearby confirmed that {{convert|5|psi|Pa|lk=out|abbr=on}} is an important threshold. Ordinary urban buildings experiencing it will be crushed, toppled, or gutted by the force of air pressure.  The picture at right shows the effects of a nuclear-bomb-generated 5 psi pressure wave on a test structure in Nevada in 1953.  . 

The most important effect of this kind of structural damage was that it created fuel for a [[firestorm]].  For this reason, the 5 psi contour defines the lethal area for blast and fire.  . 

===Fire===. 
The first effect of the explosion was blinding light, accompanied by radiant heat from the fireball. The Hiroshima fireball was {{convert|1200|ft|m}} in diameter, with a temperature of {{convert|7200|°F|°C}}.  Near ground zero, everything flammable burst into flame, glass products and sand melted into molten glass. Contrary to popular opinion, nobody would have been vapourised by the burst - the detonation occurred at over 500&nbsp;m altitude and the fireball did not reach the ground. The thermal pulse, while being hot enough to ignite flammable material at distance, was short in duration and these fires went out immediately after the flash or were blown out by the blast wave. The ensuing firestorm was caused by things like damaged fuel or gas pipes and tanks, overturned stoves, destroyed furnaces etc. One famous, anonymous Hiroshima victim left only a "shadow", permanently etched into stone steps near a bank building. Again, converse to popular knowledge, the "shadow" is not the remains or ash of the victim, but in fact it was the area around the shadow, not obscured by the person's silhouette that was lightened by X-rays from the burst, leaving a dark "negative" shadow. <ref>Photograph in the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum]].[http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/virtual/cgi-bin/museum.cgi?no=1001&l=e "Photo"]</ref> . 

[[File:Hiroshima Damage Map.png|thumb|Hiroshima blast and fire damage, U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey map.]]
The Hiroshima firestorm was roughly two miles (3.2&nbsp;km) in diameter, corresponding closely to the severe blast damage zone. (See the USSBS<ref>[http://www.anesi.com/ussbs01.htm United States Strategic Bombing Survey (Pacific War)], July 1, 1946, pp. 22-25. </ref> map, right.) Blast-damaged buildings provided fuel for the fire. Structural lumber and furniture were splintered and scattered about. Debris-choked roads obstructed fire fighters. Broken gas pipes fueled the fire, and broken water pipes rendered hydrants useless.  . 

As the map shows, the firestorm jumped natural firebreaks (river channels), as well as prepared firebreaks.  The spread of fire stopped only when it reached the edge of the blast-damaged area, encountering less available fuel.  . 

Accurate casualty figures are impossible to determine, because many victims were cremated by the firestorm. For the same reason, the proportion of firestorm victims who survived the blast and died of fire can never be known. Casualty figures are based on the estimated population inside the lethal area when the bomb detonated.  . 

===Radiation===. 
[[Nuclear fallout|Local fallout]] is dust and ash from a bomb crater, contaminated with radioactive fission products. It falls to earth downwind of the crater and can produce, with radiation alone, a lethal area much larger than that from blast and fire. With an [[air burst]], the fission products rise into the [[stratosphere]], where they dissipate and become part of the global environment. Because Little Boy was an air burst {{convert|1900|ft|m}} above the ground, there was no bomb crater and no local radioactive fallout. <ref>Glasstone and Dolan, ''The Effects of Nuclear Weapons'', p. 409. "An air burst, by definition, is one taking place at such a height above the earth that no appreciable quantities of surface material are taken up into the fireball. . . the deposition of early fallout from an air burst will generally not be significant.  An air burst, however, may produce some induced radioactive contamination in the general vicinity of ground zero as a result of neutron capture by elements in the soil."  From p. 36, "at Hiroshima . . . injuries due to fallout were completely absent."</ref> . 

Intense [[neutron radiation|neutron]] and [[gamma radiation]] came directly from the fireball. Most people close enough to receive lethal doses of direct radiation died in the firestorm before their radiation injuries would have become apparent. Survivors on the edge of the lethal area and beyond suffered injuries from radiation.  . 

Some who initially survived died soon afterward due to acute radiation sickness, but most of the radiation effects are evident only statistically, as increases in the incidence rates of cancer, leukemia and certain non-cancer diseases over the lifetimes of the survivors and their children who were exposed ''[[in utero]]''. To date, no radiation-related evidence of heritable diseases have been observed among the survivors' children. <ref>[http://rerf.or.jp/general/qa_e/qa7.html Frequently Asked Questions], Radiation Effects research foundation. </ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Izumi S, Koyama K, Soda M, Suyama A |title=Cancer incidence in children and young adults did not increase relative to parental exposure to atomic bombs |journal=Br.
