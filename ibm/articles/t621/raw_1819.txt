The '''Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons''', commonly known as the '''Non-Proliferation Treaty''' or '''NPT''', is a landmark international [[treaty]] whose objective is to prevent the spread of [[nuclear weapon]]s and weapons technology, to promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to further the goal of achieving nuclear disarmament and general and complete disarmament. Opened for signature in 1968, the Treaty entered into force in 1970. On 11 May 1995, the Treaty was extended indefinitely.  A total of 190 parties have joined the Treaty, including the five nuclear-weapon States: the [[United States]], [[Russia]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and [[People's Republic of China|China]] (also the five [[United Nations Security Council#Permanent members|permanent members]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]]). More countries have ratified the NPT than any other arms limitation and disarmament agreement, a testament to the Treaty's significance. <ref>http://www.un.org/disarmament/WMD/Nuclear/NPT.shtml</ref>  Four non-parties to the treaty are known or believed to possess nuclear weapons: [[India and weapons of mass destruction|India]], [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|Pakistan]] and [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|North Korea]] have openly tested and declared that they possess nuclear weapons, while [[Israel]] has had a policy of [[Policy of deliberate ambiguity|opacity]] regarding [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|its own nuclear weapons program]]. [[North Korea]] acceded to the treaty in 1985, but never came into compliance, and announced its withdrawal in 2003.  . 

The NPT consists of a preamble and eleven articles.  Although the concept of "pillars" is not expressed anywhere in the NPT, the treaty is nevertheless sometimes interpreted as a ''three-pillar'' system, with an implicit balance among them:
# ''[[Nuclear proliferation|non-proliferation]]'',
# ''[[Nuclear disarmament|disarmament]]'', and
# ''[[Nuclear power|the right to peacefully use nuclear technology]]''. <ref>Ambassador [[Sudjadnan Parnohadiningrat]], 26 April 2004, [[United Nations]], New York, [http://www.indonesiamission-ny.org/issuebaru/Events/opening_npt.htm Third Session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons], furnished by the [[Permanent Mission]] of the [[Republic of Indonesia]] to the [[United Nations]] (indonesiamission-ny.org)</ref> . 

The NPT is often seen to be based on a central bargain: “the NPT non-nuclear-weapon states agree never to acquire nuclear weapons and the NPT nuclear-weapon states in exchange agree to share the benefits of peaceful nuclear technology and to pursue nuclear disarmament aimed at the ultimate elimination of their nuclear arsenals”. <ref name=graham2004/> The treaty is reviewed every five years in meetings called Review Conferences of the Parties to the Treaty of Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Even though the treaty was originally conceived with a limited duration of 25 years, the signing parties decided, by consensus, to extend the treaty indefinitely and without conditions during the Review Conference in [[New York City]] on May 11, 1995.  . 

At the time the NPT was proposed, there were predictions of 25-30 nuclear weapon states within 20 years. Instead, over forty years later, only four states are not parties to the NPT, and they are the only additional states believed to possess nuclear weapons. <ref name=graham2004>{{cite web|last=Graham, Jr.|first=Thomas|url=http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2004_11/BookReview|title=Avoiding the Tipping Point|publisher=Arms Control Association|month=November|year=2004}}</ref> Several additional measures have been adopted to strengthen the NPT and the broader nuclear nonproliferation regime and make it difficult for states to acquire the capability to produce nuclear weapons, including the export controls of the [[Nuclear Suppliers Group]] and the enhanced verification measures of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] [[Additional Protocol]]. However, critics argue that the NPT cannot stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons or the motivation to acquire them. They express disappointment with the limited progress on nuclear disarmament, where the five authorized nuclear weapons states still have 22,000 warheads in their combined stockpile and have shown a reluctance to disarm further.{{dubious|date=September 2011}} Several high-ranking officials within the United Nations have said that they can do little to stop states using [[nuclear reactor]]s to produce nuclear weapons.{{dubious|date=September 2011}}<ref name=bks2011>[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] (2011). ''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', [[World Scientific]], pp. 187-190. </ref><ref name=tcr2009/> . 

==Treaty "pillars"==. 
The NPT is commonly described as having three main "pillars": non-proliferation, disarmament, and peaceful use. <ref>See, for example, the Canadian government's NPT web site [http://www.international.gc.ca/arms-armes/nuclear-nucleaire/npt-tnp.aspx The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]. </ref>  This "pillars" concept has been questioned by some who believe that the NPT is, as its name suggests, principally about nonproliferation, and who worry that "three pillars" language misleadingly implies that the three elements have equivalent importance. <ref>This view was expressed by Christopher Ford, the U.S. NPT representative at the end of the Bush Administration.  See "[http://www.state.gov/t/isn/rls/rm/98382.htm The 2010 Review Cycle So Far: A View from the United States of America]," presented at Wilton Park, United Kingdom, December 20, 2007. </ref>{{Dead link|date=April 2011}} . 

===First pillar: non-proliferation===. 
Five states are recognized by the Non-Proliferation Treaty as nuclear weapon states (NWS): [[People's Republic of China|China]] (signed 1992), [[France]] (1992), the Soviet Union (1968; obligations and rights now assumed by the [[Russian Federation]]), the [[United Kingdom]] (1968), and the [[United States]] (1968) (The United States, UK, and the Soviet Union were the only states openly possessing such weapons among the original [[ratification|ratifiers]] of the treaty, which entered into force in 1970). These five nations are also the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]]. These five NWS agree not to transfer "nuclear weapons or other [[nuclear explosive]] devices" and "not in any way to assist, encourage, or induce" a non-nuclear weapon state (NNWS) to acquire nuclear weapons (Article I). NNWS parties to the NPT agree not to "receive," "manufacture" or "acquire" nuclear weapons or to "seek or receive any assistance in the manufacture of nuclear weapons" (Article II). NNWS parties also agree to accept safeguards by the '''[[International Atomic Energy Agency]]''' (IAEA) to verify that they are not diverting nuclear energy from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons or other [[nuclear explosive]] devices (Article III).  . 

The five NWS parties have made undertakings not to use their nuclear weapons against a non-NWS party except in response to a nuclear attack, or a conventional attack in alliance with a Nuclear Weapons State. However, these undertakings have not been incorporated formally into the treaty, and the exact details have varied over time. The U.S. also had nuclear warheads targeted at North Korea, a non-NWS, from 1959 until 1991. The previous United Kingdom [[Secretary of State for Defence]], [[Geoff Hoon]], has also explicitly invoked the possibility of the use of the country's nuclear weapons in response to a non-conventional attack by "[[rogue states]]". <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/1883258.stm UK 'prepared to use nuclear weapons'] BBC article dated 20 March 2002</ref> In January 2006, President [[Jacques Chirac]] of [[France]] indicated that an incident of state-sponsored terrorism on France could trigger a small-scale nuclear retaliation aimed at destroying the "rogue state's" power centers. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4627862.stm France 'would use nuclear arms'], BBC article dated 19 January 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/19/AR2006011903311.html Chirac: Nuclear Response to Terrorism Is Possible], Washington Post article dated 20 January 2006</ref> . 

===Second pillar: disarmament===. 
Article VI of the NPT represents the only binding commitment in a multilateral treaty to the goal of disarmament by the nuclear-weapon States. The NPT's preamble contains language affirming the desire of treaty signatories to ease international tension and strengthen international trust so as to create someday the conditions for a halt to the production of nuclear weapons, and treaty on general and complete disarmament that liquidates, in particular, nuclear weapons and their delivery vehicles from national arsenals.  . 

The wording of the NPT's Article VI arguably imposes only a vague obligation on all NPT signatories to move in the general direction of nuclear and total disarmament, saying, "Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament."<ref>[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/Others/infcirc140.pdf]</ref> Under this interpretation, Article VI does not strictly require all signatories to actually conclude a disarmament treaty.  Rather, it only requires them "to negotiate in good faith."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acronym.org.uk/docs/0502/doc13.htm |title=U.S. Compliance With Article VI of the NPT |publisher=Acronym.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref> . 

On the other hand, some governments, especially non-nuclear-weapon states belonging to the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], have interpreted Article VI's language as being anything but vague.  In their view, Article VI constitutes a formal and specific obligation on the NPT-recognized nuclear-weapon states to disarm themselves of nuclear weapons, and argue that these states have failed to meet their obligation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}  The International Court of Justice (ICJ), in its [[International Court of Justice advisory opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons|advisory opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons]], issued 8 July 1996,  unanimously interprets the text of Article VI as implying that
<blockquote>"There exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control."</blockquote>
The ICJ opinion notes that this obligation involves all NPT parties (not just the nuclear weapon states) and does not suggest a specific time frame for nuclear disarmament. <ref name="ICJ">{{cite web|url=http://www.lcnp.org/wcourt/opinion.htm |title=Legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons |date=1996-07-08 |author=The [[International Court of Justice|ICJ]] |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref> . 

Critics of the NPT-recognized nuclear-weapon states{{who|date=November 2011}} sometimes argue that what they view as the failure of the NPT-recognized nuclear weapon states to disarm themselves of nuclear weapons, especially in the post–[[Cold War]] era, has angered some non-nuclear-weapon NPT signatories of the NPT.  Such failure, these critics add, provides justification for the non-nuclear-weapon signatories to quit the NPT and develop their own nuclear arsenals.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} . 

Other observers have suggested that the linkage between proliferation and disarmament may also work the other way, i.e., that the failure to resolve proliferation threats in Iran and North Korea, for instance, will cripple the prospects for disarmament.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}  No current nuclear weapons state, the argument goes, would seriously consider eliminating its last nuclear weapons without high confidence that other countries would not acquire them.  Some observers have even suggested that the very progress of disarmament by the superpowers—which has led to the elimination of thousands of weapons and delivery systems<ref>See, e.g., [http://www.state.gov/t/isn/rls/other/81946.htm Disarmament, the United States, and the NPT], Christopher Ford, U.S. Special Representative for Nuclear Nonproliferation, delivered at the Conference on "Preparing for 2010: Getting the Process Right," Annecy, France, March 17, 2007; [http://geneva.usmission.gov/CD/updates/0430USstatementNPT.html Nuclear Disarmament Progress and Challenges in the Post-Cold War World], U.S. statement to the Second Session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2010 NPT Review Conference, Geneva (April 30, 2008)</ref>—could eventually make the possession of nuclear weapons more attractive by increasing the perceived strategic value of a small arsenal.  As one U.S. official and NPT expert warned in 2007, "logic suggests that as the number of nuclear weapons decreases, the 'marginal utility' of a nuclear weapon as an instrument of military power increases.  At the extreme, which it is precisely disarmament’s hope to create, the strategic utility of even one or two nuclear weapons would be huge."<ref>[http://merln.ndu.edu/archivepdf/wmd/State/92733.pdf U.S. Special Representative for Nuclear Nonproliferation Christopher Ford, "Disarmament and Non-Nuclear Stability in Tomorrow's World," remarks to the Conference on Disarmament and Nonproliferation Issues, Nagasaki, Japan (August 31, 2007)]. </ref> . 

===Third pillar: peaceful use of nuclear energy===. 
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2008}}
The third pillar allows for and agrees upon the transfer of nuclear technology and materials to NPT signatory countries for the development of civilian nuclear energy programs in those countries, as long as they can demonstrate that their nuclear programs are not being used for the development of nuclear weapons.  . 

Since very few of the states with [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]] programs are willing to abandon the use of nuclear energy, the third pillar of the NPT under Article IV provides other states with the possibility to do the same, but under conditions intended to make it difficult to develop nuclear weapons.  . 

The treaty recognizes the inalienable right of sovereign states to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, but restricts this right for NPT parties to be exercised "in conformity with Articles I and II" (the basic nonproliferation obligations that constitute the "first pillar" of the Treaty). As the commercially popular [[light water reactor]] [[nuclear power station]] uses enriched uranium fuel, it follows that states must be able either to enrich uranium or purchase it on an international market. [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], then Director General of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], has called the spread of enrichment and reprocessing capabilities the "[[Achilles' heel]]" of the nuclear nonproliferation regime. As of 2007 13 states have an enrichment capability. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Transcripts/2007/ft190207.html|date=19 February 2007|title=Director General's Interview on Iran and DPRK|author=Daniel Dombey|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=2006-05-04}}</ref> Because the availability of fissile material has long been considered the principal obstacle to, and "pacing element" for, a country's nuclear weapons development effort, it was declared a major emphasis of U.S. policy in 2004 to prevent the further spread of uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing (a.k.a. "ENR") technology. <ref>See Remarks by President Bush at the National Defense University (February 11, 2004), available at http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2004/02/20040211-4.html (announcing initiative to stop spread of ENR technology). </ref>  Countries possessing ENR capabilities, it is feared, have what is in effect the option of using this capability to produce fissile material for weapons use on demand, thus giving them what has been termed a "virtual" nuclear weapons program.  The degree to which NPT members have a "right" to ENR technology notwithstanding its potentially grave proliferation implications, therefore, is at the cutting edge of policy and legal debates surrounding the meaning of Article IV and its relation to Articles I, II, and III of the Treaty.  . 

Countries that have signed the treaty as Non-Nuclear Weapons States and maintained that status have an unbroken record of not building nuclear weapons. However, [[Iraq]] was cited by the IAEA with punitive sanctions enacted against it by the UN Security Council for violating its NPT safeguards obligations; [[North Korea]] never came into compliance with its NPT safeguards agreement and was cited repeatedly for these violations,<ref>http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Focus/IaeaDprk/dprk.pdf and http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/MediaAdvisory/2003/med-advise_048.shtml</ref> and later withdrew from the NPT and tested multiple nuclear devices; [[Iran]] was found in non-compliance with its NPT safeguards obligations in an unusual non-consensus decision because it "failed in a number of instances over an extended period of time" to report aspects of its enrichment program;<ref name="IAEA-GOV/2003/75">{{Cite document|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Board/2003/gov2003-75.pdf |accessdate=2007-10-25|title=Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement in the Islamic Republic of Iran|date=10 November 2003|id=GOV/2003/75|publisher=IAEA |format=PDF|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref><ref name="IAEA-GOV/2005/77">{{Cite document|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Board/2005/gov2005-77.pdf |accessdate=2007-10-25|title=Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement in the Islamic Republic of Iran|date=24 September 2005|id=GOV/2005/77|publisher=IAEA |format=PDF|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> and [[Libya]] pursued a clandestine nuclear weapons program before abandoning it in December 2003. In 1991 Romania reported previously undeclared nuclear activities by the former regime and the IAEA reported this non-compliance to the Security Council for information only.  In some regions, the fact that all neighbors are verifiably free of nuclear weapons reduces any pressure individual states might feel to build those weapons themselves, even if neighbors are known to have peaceful nuclear energy programs that might otherwise be suspicious. In this, the treaty works as designed.  . 

In 2004, [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] said that by some estimates thirty-five to forty states could have the knowledge to develop nuclear weapons. <ref>{{Cite document|url=http://www.unidir.org/pdf/articles/pdf-art2185.pdf|format=PDF|title=Preserving the Non-Proliferation Treaty|author=Mohamed ElBaradei|publisher=Disarmament Forum|year=2004|accessdate=2007-11-17|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> .

==History==. 
{{See also|Nuclear proliferation}}
The impetus behind the NPT was concern for the safety of a world with many nuclear weapon states. It was recognized that the [[cold war]] deterrent relationship between just the [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union]] was fragile. Having more nuclear nuclear-weapon states would reduce security for all, multiplying the risks of miscalculation, accidents, unauthorized use of weapons, or from escalation in tensions, nuclear conflict.  . 

The NPT process was launched by [[Frank Aiken]], Irish Minister for External Affairs, in 1958. It was opened for signature in 1968, with Finland the first [[List of parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|State to sign]]. Accession became nearly universal after the end of the [[Cold War]] and of South African [[apartheid]]. 
In 1992 China and France signed the treaty, the last of the five nuclear powers named in the treaty to do so. 
In 1995 the treaty was extended indefinitely. 
After Brazil acceded to the NPT in 1998 the only remaining non-nuclear-weapons state which had not signed was Cuba, which joined NPT (and the [[Treaty of Tlatelolco]] [[NWFZ]]) in 2002.  . 

Several NPT signatories have given up nuclear weapons or nuclear weapons programs. 
[[South Africa]] undertook a nuclear weapons program, allegedly with the assistance of Israel in the 1970s, and [[Vela Incident|may have conducted]] a nuclear test in the [[Indian Ocean]] in 1979, but has since renounced its nuclear program and signed the treaty in 1991 after destroying its small nuclear [[arsenal]]; after this, the remaining African countries signed the treaty. 
Several [[former Soviet Republics]], Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, destroyed or transferred to Russia the nuclear weapons they inherited from the Soviet Union. The former Soviet republics joined NPT by 1994. Successor states from the breakups of Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia also joined the treaty soon after their independence. [[Montenegro]] and [[East Timor]] were the last countries to sign the treaty on their independence in 2006 and 2003; the only other country to sign in the 21st century was Cuba in 2002. The three Micronesian countries in [[Compact of Free Association]] with the USA joined NPT in 1995, along with [[Vanuatu]]. Major South American countries Argentina, Chile, and Brazil joined in 1995 and 1998. Arabian Peninsula countries included Saudi Arabia and Bahrain in 1988, Qatar and Kuwait in 1989, UAE in 1995, and Oman in 1997. The tiny European states of Monaco and Andorra joined in 1995-6. Also signing in the 1990s were [[Myanmar]] in 1992 and [[Guyana]] in 1993.  .

{{Main|Nuclear sharing}}
At the time the treaty was being negotiated, [[NATO]] had in place secret [[Nuclear sharing|nuclear weapons sharing]] agreements whereby the [[United States]] provided nuclear weapons to be deployed by, and stored in, other NATO states. Some argue this is an act of proliferation violating Articles I and II of the treaty. A counter-argument is that the U.S. controlled the weapons in storage within the NATO states, and that no transfer of the weapons or control over them was intended "unless and until a decision were made to go to war, at which the treaty would no longer be controlling", so there is no breach of the NPT. These agreements were disclosed to a few of the states, including the [[Soviet Union]], negotiating the treaty, but most of the states that signed the NPT in 1968 would not have known about these agreements and interpretations at that time. <ref name="is_it_legal">Otfried Nassauer, Institute for Energy and Environmental Research (ieer.org), Science for Democratic Action Volume 9 Number 3, May 2001, [http://www.ieer.org/sdafiles/vol_9/9-3/nato.html Nuclear Sharing in NATO: Is it Legal?]</ref> . 

As of 2005, it is estimated that the [[United States]] still provides about 180 tactical [[B61 nuclear bomb]]s for use by [[Belgium]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Turkey]] under these NATO agreements. <ref name="nrdc eur">Hans M. Kristensen, National Resources Defence Council (nrdc.org), February 2005, [http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/euro/euro.pdf U.S. Nuclear Weapons in Europe: A Review of Post-Cold War Policy, Force Levels, and War Planning]</ref> Many states, and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], now argue this violates Articles I and II of the treaty, and are applying diplomatic pressure to terminate these agreements. They point out that the pilots and other staff of the "non-nuclear" NATO states practice handling and delivering the U.S. nuclear bombs, and non-U.S. warplanes have been adapted to deliver U.S. nuclear bombs which must have involved the transfer of some technical nuclear weapons information. <!-- Possible OR with no citation: Even if the NATO argument is considered legally correct, such peacetime operations contravene both the objective and the spirit of the NPT. -->NATO believes its "nuclear forces continue to play an essential role in war prevention, but their role is now more fundamentally political". <ref>NATO (nato.int), [http://www.nato.int/issues/nuclear/sec-environment.htm NATO's Nuclear Forces in the New Security Environment]</ref> NATO officials also point out that no nuclear weapons have ever been given over to non-U.S. control by the United States, so therefore there cannot have been a violation of Article I (which prohibits transferring "nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or control over such weapons or explosive devices") or Article II (which bars "receiv[ing] the transfer from any transferor whatsoever of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or of control over such weapons or explosive devices").  . 

U.S. nuclear sharing policies were originally designed to help prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons—not least by persuading the then West Germany not to develop an independent nuclear capability by assuring it that West Germany would be able, in the event of war with the Warsaw Pact, to wield (U.S.) nuclear weapons in self-defense.  (Until that point of all-out war, however, the weapons themselves would remain in U.S. hands.)  The point was to limit the spread of countries having their own nuclear weapons programs, helping ensure that NATO allies would not choose to go down the proliferation route. <ref>See, e.g., U.S. Director of Central Intelligence, Likelihood and Consequences of a Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Systems, declassified U.S. National Intelligence Estimate, NIE 4-63 (June 28, 1963), at p.17, paragraph 40. </ref>  (West Germany was discussed in U.S. intelligence estimates for a number of years as being a country with the potential to develop nuclear weapons capabilities of its own if officials in Bonn were not convinced that their defense against the Soviet Union and its allies could otherwise be met. <ref>See, e.g., U.S. Director of Central Intelligence, Annex to National Intelligence Estimate No. 100-2-58: Development of Nuclear Capabilities by Fourth Countries: Likelihood and Consequences, declassified U.S. National Intelligence Estimate, NIE 100-2-58 (July 1, 1958), at p.4, paragraphs 18-19; U.S. Director of Central Intelligence, Likelihood and Consequences of the Development of Nuclear Capabilities by Additional Countries, declassified U.S. National Intelligence Estimate, NIE 100-4-60 (September 20, 1960), at p. 2, paragraph 4, & p.8, paragraphs 27-29. </ref>) . 

===India, Israel, and Pakistan===. 
{{See also|India and weapons of mass destruction|Israel and weapons of mass destruction|Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction}}
Three states—[[India]], [[Israel]], and [[Pakistan]]—have never [[List of parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|signed the treaty]]. India and Pakistan are confirmed nuclear powers, and Israel has a long-standing [[policy of deliberate ambiguity]] (see [[List of countries with nuclear weapons]]). India argues that the NPT creates a club of "nuclear haves" and a larger group of "nuclear have-nots" by restricting the legal possession of nuclear weapons to those states that tested them before 1967, but the treaty never explains on what [[ethical]] grounds such a distinction is valid.  . 

India and Pakistan have publicly announced possession of nuclear weapons and have detonated nuclear devices in tests, India having [[Smiling Buddha|first done so]] in 1974 and Pakistan following [[Chagai-I|suit]] in 1998 in [[Chagai-II|response]] to [[Pokhran-II|another Indian test]]. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2029293.stm] BBC</ref> India is estimated to have enough fissile material for more than 150 warheads. <ref>http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/atomsforwarfinal4.pdf</ref> Pakistan reportedly has between 80 and 120 warheads according to the former head of its strategic arms division. <ref>[http://www.dawn.com/2007/12/03/top7.htm Impact of US wargames on Pakistan N-arms ‘negative’ -DAWN - Top Stories; December 03, 2007]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref> India is one of the few countries to have a [[no first use]] policy, a pledge not to use nuclear weapons unless first attacked by an adversary using nuclear weapons. <ref>http://www.indianembassy.org/policy/CTBT/nuclear_doctrine_aug_17_1999.html</ref> <!--deleting citation that does not support cited claim: <ref>[http://www.undemocracy.com/meeting/A-52-PV.67#pg015-bk01 General Assembly Session 52 meeting 67]</ref>-->India's External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee said during a visit to Tokyo in 2007: "If India did not sign the NPT, it is not because of its lack of commitment for non-proliferation, but because we consider NPT as a flawed treaty and it did not recognise the need for universal, non-discriminatory verification and treatment."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whereincity.com/news/3/15197 |title=India seeks Japan's support, calls NPT 'flawed' |publisher=Whereincity.com |date=2007-03-24 |accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref><!-- Deleting claim that is irrelevant absent citation supporting early claim: China and India have a longstanding border dispute, including a border war in 1962.--> . 

According to leaked intelligence, Israel has been developing nuclear weapons at its [[Dimona]] site in the [[Negev]] since 1958, and many nonproliferation analysts like David Albright estimate that Israel may have stockpiled between 100 to 200 warheads using the plutonium reprocessed from Dimona. The Israeli government refuses to confirm or deny possession of nuclear weapons, although this is now regarded as an [[open secret]] after Israeli low level nuclear technician [[Mordechai Vanunu]]—subsequently arrested and sentenced for treason by Israel—published evidence about the program to the [[United Kingdom|British]] ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]]'' in 1986.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} . 

In early March 2006, India and the [[United States]] finalized an agreement, in the face of criticism in both countries, to provide India with US civilian nuclear technology. Under the deal India has committed to classify 14 of its 22 nuclear power plants as being for civilian use and to place them under [[IAEA]] safeguards. [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], then Director General of the [[IAEA]], welcomed the deal by calling India "an important partner in the non-proliferation regime."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://merln.ndu.edu/archivepdf/iran/State/66861.pdf |title=Remarks With International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Mohamed ElBaradei |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref> . 

In December 2006, [[United States Congress]] approved the [[United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act]] that was cemented during President Bush's visit to India earlier in the year. The legislation allows for the transfer of civilian nuclear material to India. Despite its status outside the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, India was granted these transactions on the basis of its clean non-proliferation record, and India's need for energy fueled by its rapid industrialization and a billion-plus population. <ref>{{cite web|author=(AFP) &ndash; Oct 1, 2008 |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5geN2RWjoN4oJhPibc7rhkyxMXfzg |title=AFP: India energised by nuclear pacts |publisher=Afp.google.com |date=2008-10-01 |accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref> .

The NSG Guidelines currently rule out nuclear exports by all major suppliers to Pakistan and Israel, with very narrow exceptions, since neither has full-scope IAEA safeguards (i.e. safeguards on all its nuclear activities).  Attempts by Pakistan to reach a similar agreement have been rebuffed by the United States and other NSG members.

Quite apart from the fact that North Korean First Vice Minister Kang Sok Ju at one point admitted the existence of a uranium enrichment program, Pakistan's then-President Musharraf revealed that the [[A.Q. Khan]] proliferation network had provided North Korea with a number of gas centrifuges designed for uranium enrichment.  Additionally, press reports have cited U.S. officials to the effect that evidence obtained in dismantling Libya’s WMD programs points toward North Korea as the source for Libya's [[uranium hexafluoride]] (UF<sub>6</sub>) -- which, if true, would mean that North Korea has a uranium conversion facility for producing feedstock for centrifuge enrichment. <ref>See generally U.S. Department of State, “Adherence to and Compliance With Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament Agreements and Commitments,” August 2005, pp. 87-92, www.state.gov/documents/organization/52113.pdf; Anthony Faiola, “N.

Particularly because fissile material availability has long been understood to be the principal obstacle to nuclear weapons development and the primary "pacing element" for a weapons program, the fact that Iran has reportedly suspended weaponization work may not mean very much. <ref>See, e.g., U.S. Special Representative for Nuclear Nonproliferation Christopher A.

During the days of [[apartheid]], the white South African government developed a deep fear of both a black uprising and the threat of communism. This led to the development of a secret nuclear weapons program as an ultimate deterrent. South Africa has a large supply of uranium, which is mined in the country's gold mines. The government built a nuclear research facility at [[Pelindaba]] near Pretoria where uranium was enriched to fuel grade for the [[Koeberg Nuclear Power Station]] as well as weapon grade for bomb production.  . 

In 1991, after international pressure and when a change of government was imminent, South African Ambassador to the United States [[Harry Schwarz]] signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. In 1993, the then president  [[Frederik Willem de Klerk]] openly admitted that the country had developed a limited nuclear weapon capability. These weapons were subsequently dismantled before South Africa acceded to the NPT and opened itself up to IAEA inspection. In 1994 the IAEA completed its work and declared that the country had fully dismantled its nuclear weapons program.  . 

===Libya===. 
Libya had signed and ratified the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and was subject to IAEA nuclear safeguards inspections, but undertook a secret nuclear weapons development program in violation of its NPT obligations, using material and technology provided by the [[A.Q. Khan]] proliferation network<ref>[http://isis-online.org/uploads/isis-reports/documents/IAEA_Libya_Report_12September2008.pdf Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement in the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya], International Atomic Energy Agency, GOV/2008/39, 12 September 2008. </ref>—including actual nuclear weapons designs allegedly originating in China.  Libya began secret negotiations with the United States and the United Kingdom in March 2003 over potentially eliminating its WMD programs.  In October 2003, Libya was embarrassed by the interdiction of a shipment of Pakistani-designed centrifuge parts sent from Malaysia, also as part of A. Q. Khan's proliferation ring. <ref>[http://www.isis-online.org/publications/southasia/nuclear_black_market.html Uncovering the Nuclear Black Market: Working Toward Closing Gaps in the International Nonproliferation Regime], by David Albright and Corey Hinderstein, Institute for Science and International Security, June 4, 2004. </ref>  In December 2003, Libya announced that it had agreed to eliminate all its WMD programs, and permitted U.S. and British teams (as well as IAEA inspectors) into the country to assist this process and verify its completion.  The nuclear weapons designs, gas centrifuges for uranium enrichment, and other equipment—including prototypes for improved SCUD ballistic missiles—were removed from Libya by the United States.  (Libyan chemical weapons stocks and chemical bombs were also destroyed on site with international verification, with Libya joining the Chemical Weapons Convention.)  Libya's noncompliance with its IAEA safeguards was reported to the U.N. Security Council, but with no action taken, as Libya's return to compliance with safeguards and Article II of the NPT was welcomed. <ref>See generally Assistant Secretary of State Paula DeSutter, "Libya Renounces Weapons of Mass Destruction, http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itps/0305/ijpe/desutter.htm; DeSutter, "Completion of Verification Work in Libya," testimony before the Subcommittee on International Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Human Rights (September 22, 2004), http://www.state.gov/t/vci/rls/rm/2004/37220.htm; DeSutter, "U.S. Government's Assistance to Libya in the Elimination of its Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)," testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (February 26, 2004), http://www.state.gov/t/vci/rls/rm/2004/29945.htm. </ref> . 

==Leaving the treaty==. 
Article X allows a state to leave the treaty if "extraordinary events, related to the subject matter of this Treaty, have jeopardized the supreme interests of its country", giving three months' (ninety days') notice. The state is required to give reasons for leaving the NPT in this notice.  . 

[[NATO]] states argue that when there is a state of "general war" the treaty no longer applies, effectively allowing the states involved to leave the treaty with no notice. This is a necessary argument to support the NATO [[nuclear weapons sharing]] policy, but a troubling one for the logic of the treaty. NATO's argument is based on the phrase "the consequent need to make every effort to avert the danger of such a war" in the treaty preamble, inserted at the behest of U.S. diplomats, arguing that the treaty would at that point have failed to fulfill its function of prohibiting a general war and thus no longer be binding. <ref name="is_it_legal"/> Many states do not accept this argument. See [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty#United States-NATO nuclear weapons sharing|United States-NATO nuclear weapons sharing]] above.  . 

North Korea has also caused an uproar by its use of this provision of the treaty.  Article X.1 only requires a state to give three months' notice in total, and does not provide for other states to question a state's interpretation of "supreme interests of its country".  In 1993, North Korea gave notice to withdraw from the NPT.  However, after 89 days, North Korea reached agreement with the United States to freeze its nuclear program under the [[Agreed Framework]] and "suspended" its withdrawal notice. In October 2002, the United States accused North Korea of violating the Agreed Framework by pursuing a secret uranium enrichment program, and suspended shipments of heavy fuel oil under that agreement.  In response, North Korea expelled IAEA inspectors, disabled IAEA equipment, and, on January 10, 2003, announced that it was ending the suspension of its previous NPT withdrawal notification.  North Korea said that only one more day's notice was sufficient for withdrawal from the NPT, as it had given 89 days before. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/NK/Nuclear/index.html |title=North Korea Profile - Nuclear Overview |publisher=Nti.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref> The IAEA Board of Governors rejected this interpretation. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/MediaAdvisory/2003/med-advise_048.shtml |title=Media Advisory 2003/48 - IAEA Board of Governors Adopts Resolution on Safeguards in North Korea - 12 February |publisher=Iaea.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref>  Most countries held that a new three-months withdrawal notice was required, and some questioned whether North Korea's notification met the "extraordinary events" and "supreme interests" requirements of the Treaty.  The Joint Statement of September 19, 2005 at the end of the Fourth Round of the [[Six-Party Talks]] called for North Korea to "return" to the NPT, implicitly acknowledging that it had withdrawn.  . 

==Recent and coming events==. 
The [http://www.un.org/events/npt2000/ 2000 Review Conference] had as main outcome the definition in practical terms of the nuclear weapons states' disarmament obligations, summarized in the so called [[Thirteen Steps]].  . 

On 18 July 2005, US President George W. Bush had met Indian Prime Minister [[Manmohan Singh]] and declared that he would work to change US law and international rules to permit trade in US civilian nuclear technology with India. <ref>The Associated Press, 2005, [http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/07/18/us.india.ap/ Bush opens energy door to India], furnished by CNN (cnn.com), 18 July 2005</ref>  Some, such as British columnist [[George Monbiot]], argue that the U.S.-India nuclear deal, in combination with US attempts to deny [[Iran]] (an NPT signatory) civilian nuclear fuel-making technology, may destroy the NPT regime,<ref>George Monbiot, The Guardian (guardian.co.uk), 2 August 2005, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,5673,1540683,00.html The treaty wreckers]</ref> while others{{Who|date=December 2008}} contend that such a move will likely bring India, an NPT non-signatory, under closer international scrutiny.  . 

In the first half of 2010, it was strongly believed that China had signed a civilian nuclear deal with Pakistan claiming that the deal was "peaceful"<ref name=BBCUK/>.  . 

[[Arms control treaty|Arms control]] advocates critcised the reported [[Nuclear_power_in_Pakistan#People's_Republic_of_China|China-Pakistan deal]] as they did in case of [[U.S.–India Civil Nuclear Agreement|U.S.-India  deal]] claiming that both the deals violate the NPT by facilitating nuclear programmes in states which are not parties to the NPT<ref name=globalissues/>. Some reports asserted that the deal was a strategic move by China to balance US influence in [[South-Asia]]. <ref name=nti.org/> . 

According to a report published by [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] in 2001, China had provided Pakistan with [[nuclear materials]] and has given critical technological assistance in the construction of Pakistan's nuclear weapons development facilities, in violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, of which China even then was a signatory. <ref name=TWR>{{cite news|title=US Report: China gifted nuclear bomb and Pakistan stole the technology|url=http://www.theworldreporter.com/2009/11/us-report-china-gifted-nuclear-bomb-and.html|accessdate=12 March 2012|newspaper=The world reporter|date=2009-11-18.}}</ref><ref name=CSIS>{{cite news|title=Nuclear Weapons Proliferation report|url=http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/pblctns/prspctvs/200110-eng.asp|accessdate=12 March 2012|newspaper=Canadian Security Intelligence Service|date=October 2001}}</ref> . 

At the [http://www.un.org/events/npt2005/ Seventh Review Conference in May 2005], there were stark differences between the [[United States]], which wanted the conference to focus on non-proliferation, especially on its allegations against [[Iran]], and most other countries, who emphasized the lack of serious [[nuclear disarmament]] by the nuclear powers. The [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned countries]] reiterated their position emphasizing the need for nuclear disarmament. <ref>Syed Hamid Albar, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Malaysia, United Nations (un.org), New York, 2 May 2005, [http://www.un.org/events/npt2005/statements/npt02malaysia.pdf The General Debate of the 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]</ref> . 

The [[NPT Review Conference|2010 Review Conference]] was held in May 2010 in New York City, and adopted a final document that included a summary by the Review Conference President, Ambassador Libran Capactulan of the Philippines, and an Action Plan that was adopted by consensus. <ref>[http://www.reachingcriticalwill.org/legal/npt/NIR2010/finaldocsummary.html Summary of the 2010 NPT final outcome document], Beatrice Fihn, Reaching Critical Will, June 1, 2010. </ref><ref>[http://www.reachingcriticalwill.org/legal/npt/revcon2010/FinalDocument.pdf Final Document], 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT/CONF.2010/50, adopted May 28, 2010. </ref> The 2010 conference was generally considered a success because it reached consensus where the previous Review Conference in 2005 ended in disarray, a fact that many attributed to the [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]]'s commitment to nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament.  Some have warned that this success raised unrealistically high expectations that could lead to failure at the next Review Conference in 2015. <ref>www.boell.eu/downloads/NPT_eventreport.pdf</ref> . 

<!--The 2007 and 2008 meetings of the NPT Preparatory Committee -- devoted to preparing the way for the 2010 Review Conference -- saw a considerable improvement in the tone of discussions.  The 2007 meeting, in particular, was notable for the degree to which most other governments stood united against Iranian efforts to use procedural maneuvers related to the agenda to delay substantive discussions of nonproliferation issues. <ref>See, e.g., U.S. Special Representative for Nuclear Nonproliferation Christopher Ford, "Lessons Learned from the 2007 Preparatory Committee Meeting," remarks at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (June 25, 2007), http://www.state.gov/t/isn/rls/rm/87983.htm. </ref>  Disarmament criticism of the nuclear weapons states was also more muted, perhaps as a result of high-profile engagement by some weapons-state representatives to highlight the dramatic and continuing reductions in nuclear arsenals that have been underway in the United States and Russia since the end of the Cold War. <ref>Disarmament, the United States, and the NPT," U.S. government paper delivered at the Conference on "Preparing for 2010: Getting the Process Right," Annecy, France (March 17, 2007), available at http://www.state.gov/t/isn/rls/other/81946.htm (detailing U.S. reductions); "Nuclear Disarmament Progress and Challenges in the Post-Cold War World," U.S. government statement to the Second Session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2010 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, Palais des Nations, Geneva (April 30, 2008), available at http://geneva.usmission.gov/CD/updates/0430USstatementNPT.html (updating account of U.S. reductions). </ref>-->

==Criticism and responses==. 
{{Criticism section|date=February 2012}}
Over the years the NPT has come to be seen by many Third World states as “a conspiracy of the nuclear ‘haves’ to keep the nuclear ‘have-nots’ in their place”.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} This argument has its roots in Article VI of the treaty which “obligates the nuclear weapons states to liquidate their nuclear stockpiles and pursue complete disarmament. The non-nuclear states see no signs of this happening”. <ref name=graham2004/><ref name=tcr2009/> . 

Some argue that the NWS have not fully complied with their disarmament obligations under Article VI of the  NPT. <ref>{{cite web|last=Rendall |first=Steve |url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2619 |title=Ignoring the U.S.'s "Bad Atoms" |publisher=Fair.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref> There has been disappointment with the limited progress on nuclear disarmament, where the five authorized nuclear weapons states still have 22,000 warheads between them and have shown a reluctance to disarm further. <ref name=bks2011/> . 

As noted [[#Second pillar: disarmament|above]], The International Court of Justice, in its [[International Court of Justice advisory opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons|advisory opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons]], stated that "there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control. <ref name="ICJ"/>  Such an obligation requires that states actively pursue measures to reduce the numbers of nuclear weapons and the importance of their role in military force structures.{{says who|date=November 2011}}  Some critics of the nuclear-weapons states contend that they have failed to comply with Article VI by failing to make disarmament the driving force in national planning and policy with respect to nuclear weapons, even while they ask other states to plan for their security without nuclear weapons. <ref>|wmdreport.org/ndcs/online/NuclearDisorderPart1Section2.pdf |</ref> . 

The United States responds to criticism of its disarmament record by pointing out that since the end of the Cold War it has eliminated over 13,000 nuclear weapons and eliminated over 80% of its deployed strategic warheads and 90% of non-strategic warheads deployed to NATO, in the processing eliminating whole categories of warheads and delivery systems and reducing its reliance on nuclear weapons.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  U.S. officials have also pointed out the ongoing U.S. work to dismantle nuclear warheads. When current accelerated dismantlement efforts ordered by President George W. Bush have been completed, the U.S. arsenal will be less than a quarter of its size at the end of the Cold War, and smaller than it has been at any point since the Eisenhower administration, well before the drafting of the NPT. <ref>[http://www.defense.gov/news/d20100503stockpile.pdf Fact Sheet: Increasing Transparency in the U.S. Nuclear Weapons Stockpile], May 3, 2010. </ref>  The United States has also purchased many thousands of weapons' worth of uranium formerly in Soviet nuclear weapons for conversion into reactor fuel. <ref>See. e.g., "Disarmament, the United States, and the NPT," http://www.state.gov/t/isn/rls/other/81946.htm; U.S. Special Representative for Nuclear Nonproliferation Christopher Ford, "Procedure and Substance in the NPT Review Cycle: The Example of Nuclear Disarmament," remarks to the Conference on "Preparing for 2010: Getting the Process Right," Annecy, France (March 17, 2007), http://www.state.gov/t/isn/rls/rm/81940.htm; "The United States and Article VI: A Record of Accomplishment," http://geneva.usmission.gov/CD/updates/05-06-08%20Article%20VI%20Briefing.pdf. </ref> (As a consequence of this latter effort, it has been estimated that the equivalent of one lightbulb in every ten in the United States is powered by nuclear fuel removed from warheads previously targeted at the United States and its allies during the Cold War. <ref>Remarks by U.S. National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley at the Center for International Security and Cooperation, Stanford University (February 8, 2008), http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/02/20080211-6.html. </ref>)  The U.S. Special Representative for Nuclear Nonproliferation agreed that  nonproliferation and disarmament are linked, noting that they can be mutually reinforcing but also that growing proliferation risks create an environment that makes disarmament more difficult. <ref>[http://www.state.gov/t/isn/rls/other/81946.htm Disarmament, the United States, and the NPT]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref>  The United Kingdom,<ref>[http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/fco-in-action/counter-terrorism/weapons/nuclear-weapons/ FCO fact sheet on nuclear weapons]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref> France<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2005_01-02/Levitte |title=The 2005 NPT Review Conference: A French Perspective |publisher=Armscontrol.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref> and Russia<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/events/npt2005/statements/npt03russian.pdf |title=Statement by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Kislyak at the 2005 NPT Review Conference |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref> likewise defend their nuclear disarmament records, and the five NPT NWS issued a joint statement in 2008 reaffirming their Article VI disarmament commitments. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/NPT2010/SecondSession/delegates%20statements/P5%20Statement.pdf |title=Statement of the P5 to the 2008 NPT PrepCom |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref> . 

According to Thomas Reed and Danny Stillman, the “NPT has one giant loophole”: Article IV gives each non-nuclear weapon state the ‘inalienable right’ to pursue nuclear energy for the generation of power. <ref name=tcr2009>Thomas C. Reed and Danny B. Stillman (2009). ''The Nuclear Express: A Political History of the Bomb and its Proliferation'', Zenith Press, p. 144. </ref> A "number of high-ranking officials, even within the United Nations, have argued that they can do little to stop states using [[nuclear reactor]]s to produce nuclear weapons". <ref name=bks2011/> A 2009 United Nations report said that:
<blockquote>
The revival of interest in nuclear power could result in the worldwide dissemination of uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing technologies, which present obvious risks of proliferation as these technologies can produce fissile materials that are directly usable in nuclear weapons. <ref name=bks2011/>
</blockquote> . 

Moreover, the NPT says nothing about aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle “such as uranium mines and mills, from which terrorists could easily acquire fissile material”. <ref name=bks2011/> Dozens of nations remain potential "weak links" in the global defense against nuclear terrorism and tacitly ignore UN mandates on controls over fissile material at uranium mines. Niger, a major uranium exporter, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the source of uranium for the first atomic bomb, are "among the states falling short in complying with UN Security Council Resolution 1540". <ref name=bks2011/> . 

According to critics, those states which possess nuclear weapons, but are not authorized to do so under the NPT, have not paid a significant price for their pursuit of weapons capabilities. Also, the NPT has been explicitly weakened by a number of bilateral deals made by NPT signatories, notably the United States. <ref name=bks2011/> .
