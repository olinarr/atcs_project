{{nuclear weapons}} . 

The '''United Kingdom''' was the third country to test an independently developed [[nuclear weapon]], in October 1952. It is one of the five "[[Nuclear Weapons States]]" (NWS) under the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]], which the UK ratified in 1968. The UK is currently thought to retain a weapons stockpile of around 160 operational nuclear [[warhead]]s and 225 nuclear warheads in total but has refused to declare the exact size of its arsenal. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/programs/ssp/nukes/nuclearweapons/nukestatus.html |title=Federation of American Scientists :: Status of World Nuclear Forces |publisher=Fas.org |date=2010-05-26 |accessdate=2010-07-30}}</ref> . 

Since the [[1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement]], the [[United States]] and the United Kingdom have cooperated extensively on nuclear security matters. The [[special relationship]] between the two countries has involved the exchange of classified scientific information and nuclear materials such as [[plutonium]]. The UK has not run an independent nuclear weapons delivery system development and production programme since the cancellation of the [[Blue Streak missile]] in the 1960s, instead it has pursued joint development (for its own use) of US delivery systems, designed and manufactured by [[Lockheed Martin]], and fitting them with warheads designed and manufactured by the UK's Atomic Weapons Research Establishment and its successor the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment]]. In 1974 a US proliferation assessment noted that "In many cases [Britain's sensitive technology in nuclear and missile fields] is based on technology received from the US and could not legitimately be passed on without US permission."<ref name=SNIE-4-1-74>{{Cite book|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB240/snie.pdf|format=PDF|series=Special National Intelligence Estimate|title=Prospects for Further Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|page=40|publisher=[[CIA]]|date=23 August 1974|id=SNIE 4-1-74|accessdate=2008-01-20}}</ref> . 

In contrast with the other permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]], the United Kingdom currently operates only a single nuclear weapon delivery system since decommissioning its tactical [[WE.177]] free-falling nuclear bombs in 1998. The present system consists of four [[Vanguard class submarine|''Vanguard'' class]] submarines based at [[HMNB Clyde]], armed with up to 16 [[Trident missile]]s, which each carry nuclear warheads in up to eight [[Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle|MIRVs]], performing both [[military strategy|strategic]] and [[Tactical nuclear weapon|sub-strategic]] deterrence roles.  . 

While a firm decision has yet to be taken on the replacement of the UK's nuclear weapons, the manufacturer of the UK's warheads, [[Atomic Weapons Establishment|AWE]], is currently undertaking research which is largely dedicated to providing new warheads<ref>{{Cite news| first =  Marie | last = Woolf | title = So, minister, are we developing new nuclear weapons or not?; Scientists say they are designing a new warhead design, despite government denials| work = The Independent on Sunday | publisher = Newspaper Publishing plc | page = 6 | date = 2006-10-29 | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}</ref> and on 4 December 2006 the then Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] announced [[British replacement of the Trident system|plans for a new class of nuclear missile submarines]]. <ref>{{Cite news| title = Blair's Trident statement in full | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6207584.stm | publisher = BBC News | date = 2006-12-04 | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}</ref> . 

==Number of warheads==. 
[[File:HMNB Clyde.jpg|thumb|right|Faslane Naval Base, [[HMNB Clyde]], [[Scotland]]. Home of the [[Vanguard class submarine]]s which carry the UK's current nuclear arsenal.]]
In the Strategic Defence Review published in July 1998, the [[United Kingdom government]] stated that once the Vanguard submarines became fully operational (the fourth and final one, [[HMS Vengeance (S31)|''Vengeance'']], entered service on 27 November 1999), it would "maintain a stockpile of fewer than 200 operationally available warheads". <ref>Point 64, [http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/65F3D7AC-4340-4119-93A2-20825848E50E/0/sdr1998_complete.pdf Strategic Defence Review], Presented to Parliament by the Secretary of State for Defence, George Robertson, July 1998</ref> The [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]] has estimated the figure as about 165, consisting of 144 deployed weapons plus an extra 15 percent as spares. <ref>[http://www.sipri.org/contents/expcon/uk.pdf SIPRI project on nuclear technology and arms]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref> . 

At the same time, the UK government indicated that warheads "required to provide a necessary processing margin and for technical surveillance purposes" were not included in the "fewer than 200" figure. <ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmhansard/vo980714w19.htm#80714w19.html_spnew0 House of Commons Written Answers], Hansard, 14 July 1998 : Column:171</ref> However, as recently declassified archived documents on [[Chevaline]] make clear, the 15% excess (referred to by SIPRI as for spares) is normally intended to provide the 'necessary processing margin', and 'surveillance rounds do not contain any nuclear material, being completely inert. These surveillance rounds are used to monitor deterioration in the many non-nuclear components of the warhead, and are best compared with inert training rounds. The SIPRI figures correspond accurately with the official announcements and are likely to be the most accurate. The [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] speculates that a figure of 200 is accurate to within a few tens. <ref>[http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/nudb/datab19.asp Table of Global Nuclear Weapons Stockpiles, 1945-2002], National Resources Defense Council, 25 November 2002</ref> In 2008 the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] stated that the UK stockpile was of fewer than 160 operationally available nuclear warheads. <ref name=nao-2008>{{Cite book|url=http://www.nao.org.uk/pn/07-08/07081115.htm|title=Ministry of Defence: The United Kingdomâ€™s Future Nuclear Deterrent Capability|date=5 November 2008|publisher=[[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]]|isbn=9780102954364|accessdate=2008-11-09|author=}}</ref>
During a debate on the [[Queen's Speech]] on 26 May 2010 [[Foreign Secretary]] [[William Hague]] reiterated that the UK has no more than 160 operationally available warheads, and announced that the total number will not exceed 225. <ref name=bbc-20100526>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8706600.stm|title=UK to be "more open" about nuclear warhead levels|date=2010-05-26|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2010-05-26}}</ref> .

Because Britain did not test as often as the United States due to financial and political reasons, and did not have the Americans' state-of-the-art computer facilities, British weapons design depended more on theoretical understanding, with potential for both greater advances and risks between tests.{{r|spinardi199708}} The low numbers of UK tests is misleading when compared to the large numbers of tests carried out by the US, the [[Soviet Union]], [[China]], and especially [[France]]; because the UK has had extensive access to US test data, obviating the need for UK tests: and an added factor is that many tests required are for 'weapon effects tests'; tests not of the nuclear device itself, but of the nuclear effects on hardened components designed to resist ABM attack. Numerous such 'effects' tests were done in support of the [[Chevaline]] programme especially; and there is some evidence that some were permitted for the French programme to harden their RVs and warheads; because most French tests being under the ocean floor, access to measure 'weapon effects' was nigh impossible. <ref>Public Record Office, London, DEFE 19/180, E66. Declassified Jan 2006 using the FOI Act. </ref> An independent test programme would see the UK numbers soar to French levels.  . 

The UK government signed the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] on 5 August 1963<ref>[http://cns.miis.edu/pubs/inven/pdfs/atosuw.pdf Inventory of International Nonproliferation Organizations and Regimes], Center for Nonproliferation Studies. </ref> along with the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] which effectively restricted it to underground nuclear tests by outlawing testing in the atmosphere, underwater, or in outer space. The UK signed the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]] on 24 September 1996<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmhansrd/vo971106/debtext/71106-22.htm#71106-22_head0 House of Commons Debate, Nuclear Explosions (Prohibition and Inspections) Bill], Hansard, 6 Nov 1997 : Column 455</ref> and ratified it on 6 April 1998,<ref>[http://www.basicint.org/nuclear/CTBT/status.htm Status of CTBT Ratification], British American Security Information Council, last updated on 14 June 2001</ref> having passed the necessary legislation on 18 March 1998 as the Nuclear Explosions (Prohibition and Inspections) Act 1998.  .

===Warning systems===. 
[[File:Radar RAF Fylingdales.jpg|thumb|right|This solid-state [[phased array]] [[radar]] at RAF Fylingdales in [[North Yorkshire]] is a UK-controlled early warning station and part of the American-controlled [[Ballistic Missile Early Warning System]].]]
{{See also|Four minute warning|RAF Fylingdales|Ballistic Missile Early Warning System|National Missile Defense}}
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The UK has relied on the [[Ballistic Missile Early Warning System]] (BMEWS) and, in later years, [[Defense Support Program]] (DSP) satellites for warning of a nuclear attack. Both of these systems are owned and controlled by the United States, although the UK has joint control over UK based systems. One of the four component radars for the BMEWS is based at [[RAF Fylingdales]] in [[North Yorkshire]].  . 

In 2003 the UK government stated that it will consent to a request from the US to upgrade the radar at Fylingdales for use in the US [[National Missile Defense]] system. <ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030115/debtext/30115-07.htm  Statement by the Secretary of State for Defence], Hansard 15 Jan 2003 : Column 697</ref> . 

Nevertheless, missile defence is not currently a significant political issue within the UK.  The ballistic missile threat is perceived to be less severe, and consequently less of a priority, than other threats to its security. <ref>[http://www.rusi.org/militarysciences/capabilities/commentary/ref:C42528744B491A/ Royal United Services Institute - Ballistic Missile Defence and the UK] April 2005</ref>

===Attack scenarios===. 
During the [[Cold War]], a significant effort by government and academia was made to assess the effects of a nuclear attack on the UK. There were four major exercises: . 

* '''Exercise ''Inside Right''''' took place on 6-26 October 1975. 
* '''Exercise ''Scrum Half''''' conducted in 1978. 
* '''Exercise ''[[Square Leg]]''''' conducted in 1980. The scenario involved around 130 warheads with a total yield of 205 [[megatons]] (69 [[ground burst]], 62 [[air burst]]) with an average of 1.5 megatons per bomb. The exercise was criticised as unrealistic as an actual exchange would be much larger, with one academic describing a 200-megaton attack as an "extremely low figure and one which we find  very difficult to take seriously"<ref name="rogers">Possible Nuclear Attack Scenarios on Britain, Paul Rogers, Proceedings of Conference on Nuclear Deterrence: Implications and Policy Options for the 1980s, September 1981</ref>, and did not include targets in [[Inner London]] such as [[Whitehall]]. <ref>{{cite book|title=Doomsday, Britain after Nuclear Attack|author=[[Stan Openshaw]], Philip Steadman and Owen Greene|publisher=Basil Blackwell|year=1983|isbn=0631133941|page=105}}</ref> Even so, the effect of the limited attack in Square Leg was estimated to be 29 million dead (53% of the population) and 6.4 million seriously injured. <ref name="Campbell">{{cite book|title=War Plan UK|author=Duncan Campbell|publisher=Paladin|year=1983|isbn=0586084797|page=32}}</ref>
* '''Exercise ''Hard Rock''''' planned for 1982. A combined communications and civil defence exercise planned for September and October 1982. It assumed a conventional war in Europe lasting 2-3 days, during which the United Kingdom would be attacked with conventional weapons, then a limited nuclear exchange with 54 warheads being used against military targets in the UK. 250,000 people protested against the exercise and 24 councils refused to participate. <ref name="Campbell"/> The limited scenario still assumed casualties of 7.9 million dead and 5 million injured. <ref name="Campbell"/> The scenario was ridiculed by the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] and the exercise was postponed indefinitely. <ref>{{cite book|title=Toward Nuclear Abolition: A History of the World Nuclear Disarmament Movement, 1971-Present|author=Lawrence S. Wittner|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2003|isbn=0804748624|page=294}}</ref> The ''[[New Statesman]]'' later claimed the Ministry of Defence insisted on having a veto over proposed targets in the exercise and several were removed to make them politically more acceptable, for example the nuclear submarine base [[HMNB Clyde]] was removed from the target list. <ref>{{cite news|title=Hard Rock is cancelled again|publisher=New Statesman|date=11 March 1983|page=6}}</ref> . 

In the early 1980s it was thought an attack causing almost complete loss of life could be achieved with the use of less than 15% of the total nuclear yield available to the Soviets. <ref name="rogers"/> . 

===Civil defence===. 
{{Main|civil defence|Protect and Survive}}
During the cold war, various governments developed [[civil defence]] programmes aimed to prepare civilian and local government infrastructure for a nuclear strike on the UK. A series of seven [[Civil Defence Bulletin]] films were produced in 1964; and in the 1980s the most famous such programme was probably the series of booklets and [[public information film]]s entitled ''[[Protect and Survive]]''.  . 

{{quote|If the country was ever faced with an immediate threat of nuclear threat or complete annihilation, a copy of this booklet would be distributed to every household as part of a public information campaign which would include announcements on television and radio and in the press. The booklet has been designed for free and general distribution in that event. It is being placed on sale now for those who wish to know what they would be advised to do at such a time. <ref>[http://ukcoldwar.simplenet.com/protect/online/ Protect and Survive], prepared for the Home Office by the Central Office of Information, May 1980</ref>}} . 

The booklet contained information on building a [[Fallout shelter|nuclear refuge]] within a so-called 'fall out room' at home, sanitation, limiting fire hazards and descriptions of the audio signals for attack warning, fallout warning and all clear. It was anticipated that families might need to stay within the fall-out room for up to fourteen days after an attack almost without leaving it at all.  . 

The government also prepared a recorded announcement which was to have been broadcast by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] if a nuclear attack ever did occur. <ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081003/ap_on_re_eu/eu_britain_nuclear_war_broadcasts;_ylt=AoSFXJphN6d3PxFaSPdn_Q8UewgF  Britain planned taped messages after nuclear war], by Gregory Katz, Associated Press, 3 October 2008. </ref> . 

Sirens left over from the [[London Blitz]] during [[World War II]]{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} were also to be used to warn the public. The system was mostly dismantled in 1993.  . 

==Weapons programmes==. 
''See also [[History of nuclear weapons]]''
[[File:Trinity shot color.jpg|thumb|right|The United Kingdom worked in partnership with the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] on the [[Manhattan Project]], resulting in the development of the first nuclear weapons, and the first-ever nuclear detonation at the [[Trinity test]] of 16 July 1945.]] . 

===Tube Alloys and Manhattan Project===. 
{{Main|Tube Alloys|Manhattan Project}} . 

The United Kingdom's nuclear weapons had their genesis in the [[Second World War]] when two recently exiled atomic scientists, [[Otto Robert Frisch|Otto Frisch]] and [[Rudolf Peierls]] wrote a memorandum on the construction of "a radioactive super-bomb". Forwarded to the [[Ministry of Aircraft Production]] (MAP), the secret [[MAUD Committee]] to evaluate the possibilities was soon set up. <ref name="Frisch-Peierls">[[Peter Hennessy]], "Cabinets and the Bomb", The British Academy/Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 31. </ref> British scientists worked initially alone on the atomic bomb under the cover name of ''[[Tube Alloys]]'', later becoming a partner in the tri-national [[Manhattan Project]] under the [[Quebec Agreement]]. The Manhattan Project resulted in the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|two nuclear weapons dropped over Japan]].  . 

===Post-war development programme===. 
After Hiroshima and Nagasaki revealed the existence of the atomic bomb to the world, [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Prime Minister]] [[Clement Attlee]] published a detailed account, prepared by his [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] predecessor [[Winston Churchill]], of the United Kingdom's participation in developing the bomb. On 8 August 1945 Attlee sent a message to President [[Harry Truman]] in which he referred to themselves as "heads of the Governments which have control of this great force". For the next year he attempted to persuade Truman to grant access to information which the British believed they deserved given their involvement.{{r|goldberg196407}} . 

The Americans did not share Attlee's view, however. Manhattan Project head [[Leslie Groves]] had excluded British scientists from participating in the manufacturing of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs, contrary to the intentions of his government for close cooperation, for security reasons. Postwar spy scandals in both countries increased American concerns over atomic secrecy. More importantly, Truman hoped to establish international control over atomic weapons, and sharing information with even a close ally like Britain might have made such controls impossible. Nonetheless, the Americans' refusal to share information, formalised by the [[McMahon Act]] of 1946 restricting foreign access to US nuclear technology, shocked and disappointed the British. <ref name="goldberg196407">{{cite journal | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2610825 . | title=The Atomic Origins of the British Nuclear Deterrent | author=Goldberg, Alfred | journal=International Affairs | year=1964 | month=July | volume=40 | issue=3 | pages=409â€“429}}</ref> . 

The United Kingdom started independently developing nuclear weapons again shortly after the war. Attlee set up a [[United Kingdom cabinet committee|cabinet sub-committee]], the [[Gen 75 Committee|Gen 75 Committee (GEN.75)]] (known informally as the "Atomic Bomb Committee"), to examine the feasibility as early as 29 August 1945.{{r|goldberg196407}} The [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Air Staff]] [[Arthur Tedder]] officially requested an atomic weapon in August 1946,{{r|spinardi199708}} but work on a British equivalent to the vast American facilities at [[Hanford, Washington]] and [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] began in February 1946. American refusal to continue nuclear cooperation (except in certain non weapons-related areas in exchange for uranium from the British-controlled supply in the [[Belgian Congo]]) only affected the amount of cooperation the British expected to receive,{{r|goldberg196407}} for the government had decided that atomic weapons were vital to the nation regardless of cost: . 

{{quote|In October 1946, Attlee called a small cabinet sub-committee meeting to discuss building a gaseous diffusion plant to enrich uranium. The meeting was about to decide against it on grounds of cost, when [[Ernest Bevin|[Ernest] Bevin]] arrived late and said "We've got to have this thing. I don't mind it for myself, but I don't want any other [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] of this country to be talked at or to by the [[James F. Byrnes|Secretary of State of the US]] as I have just been... We've got to have this thing over here, whatever it costs ... We've got to have the bloody [[Union Jack]] on top of it."<ref>Sir M. Perrin, who was present, ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'', 7 October 1982. Also quoted in ''How Nuclear Weapons Decisions are Made'', p.137, 1986, Oxford Research Group. </ref>}} . 

The committee, under pressure from [[Hugh Dalton]] and Sir [[Stafford Cripps]] to opt out of building the bomb due to its cost, eventually decided to go ahead not just because of considerations of Britain's prestige but also because of the likely industrial importance of atomic energy. <ref name="GEN 75 arguments">[[Peter Hennessy]], "Cabinets and the Bomb", The British Academy/Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 48. </ref> . 

A nuclear programme started in 1946 under the control of the [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]] (incorporated into the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] (UKAEA) in 1954), that was civilian in character, but was also tasked with the job of producing the fissile material, initially only plutonium 239, that was expected to be required for a military programme. It was based on a former airfield, [[Harwell, Oxfordshire|Harwell]], [[Berkshire]]; and a former [[Royal Ordnance Factory]], [[Risley, Warrington|Risley]] in [[Cheshire]]. Risley became the headquarters of the Industrial Division of UKAEA, and there were other sites under its control, notably the Calder Hall reactors at Windscale (later [[Sellafield]]) used to produce weapons grade Pu-239. The first nuclear pile in the UK, [[GLEEP]], went critical at Harwell on 15 August 1947. The first plutonium metal was ready at Windscale in March 1952. AWRE was established at Aldermaston by the [[Ministry of Supply]]; later becoming the Weapons Division of the (civilian) UKAEA, before being subsumed into the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] in the 1970s.  . 

[[William George Penney|William Penney]], a [[physicist]] specialising in [[hydrodynamics]] was asked in October 1946 to prepare a report on the viability of building a UK weapon. Joining the Manhattan project in 1944, he had been in the observation plane ''[[Big Stink]]'' over [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], and had also done damage assessment on the ground following [[Japan]]'s surrender. He had subsequently participated in the American [[Operation Crossroads]] test at [[Bikini Atoll]]. As a result of his report, the decision to proceed was formally made on 8 January 1947 at a meeting of the GEN.163 committee of six cabinet members including Attlee, with Penney appointed to take charge of the programme. <ref name="spinardi199708">{{cite journal | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/285558 | title=Aldermaston and British Nuclear Weapons Development: Testing the 'Zuckerman Thesis' | author=Spinardi, Graham | journal=Social Studies of Science | year=1997 | month=August | volume=27 | issue=4 | pages=547â€“582}}</ref> . 

The project was hidden under the name High Explosive Research or HER and was based initially at the [[Ministry of Supply]]'s Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE) at [[Fort Halstead]] in Kent,<ref>Arnold, Lorna (2001).''Britain and the H-Bomb: the official history''.

The Attlee ministry revealed the existence of a British atomic program in Parliament on 12 May 1948;{{r|spinardi199708}} the announcement was viewed by Parliament, the press, and the people as uncontroversial.{{r|goldberg196407}} The government refused to provide details on its progress beyond stating that atomic weapons research was of the highest priority, but it was assumed that the project was following the Americans' precedents. While [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]], Churchill criticised the government in February 1951 for not having completed an atomic weapon.{{r|goldberg196407}}<ref name="gott1963">{{cite journal | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2611300 | title=The Evolution of the Independent British Deterrent | author=Gott, Richard | journal=International Affairs | year=1963 | month=April | volume=39 | issue=2 | pages=238â€“252}}</ref> . 

Although British scientists knew well the areas of the Manhattan Project in which they had worked, they only had the sketchiest details of those parts which they were not directly involved in,{{r|spinardi199708}} and the McMahon Act prevented American aid. By 1949, international control of atomic weapons seemed almost impossible to achieve, and Truman proposed to the [[Joint Committee on Atomic Energy]] in July a "full partnership" with Britain in exchange for uranium. While the [[Joe 1|first Soviet atomic bomb test]] the next month was embarrassing to the British for having been beaten, it was for the Americans another reason for cooperation. The arrest in early 1950, however, of [[Klaus Fuchs]], a [[USSR|Soviet]] [[spy]] working at Harwell, destroyed the opportunity for renewing the partnership. After Britain developed atomic weapons through its own efforts, the scientist Sir Leonard Owen nonetheless stated that "the McMahon Act was probably one of the best things that happened ... as it made us work and think for ourselves along independent lines."{{r|goldberg196407}} .

The girder from which the weapon is suspended would measure at least six feet (1.83&nbsp;m) from ground level. The first Blue Danube weapons issued to the RAF were of {{convert|10. |-|12|ktonTNT|adj=on}} yield, approximately the same yield as the [[Little Boy|Hiroshima bomb]], although that was much smaller, being of a gun-type, whereas Blue Danube was of the implosion type similar to the [[Fat Man|Nagasaki bomb]]. This Blue Danube airframe design was used to house all the devices detonated at Christmas Island in the [[Operation Grapple]] tests.]]
Churchill, now again prime minister, announced on 17 February 1952 that the first British weapon test would occur before the end of the year. [[Operation Hurricane]] was detonated below the frigate [[HMS Plym (K271)|HMS ''Plym'']] anchored in the [[Monte Bello Islands, Western Australia]] on 3 October 1952.{{r|goldberg196407}} This led to the first deployed weapon, the [[Blue Danube (nuclear weapon)|Blue Danube]] free-fall bomb, in November 1953. It was very similar to the American Mark 4 weapon in having a {{convert|60|in|adj=on}} diameter, 32 lens implosion system with a levitated core suspended within a natural uranium tamper. The warhead was contained within a bomb casing measuring 62&nbsp;inches (1.6&nbsp;m) diameter and 24 feet (7.3&nbsp;m) long, and being so large, could only be carried by the [[V bomber]] fleet.  . 

A nuclear landmine dubbed Brown Bunny, later Blue Bunny, and finally [[Blue Peacock]] that used the Blue Danube warhead was developed from 1954 with the goal of deployment in the [[Rhine]] area of [[Germany]]. The system would have been set to an eight-day timer in the case of invasion of Western Europe by the Soviets but was cancelled in February 1958 with only two built. It was judged that the risks posed by the [[nuclear fallout]] and the political aspects of preparing for destruction and contamination of allied territory were simply too high to justify. A more usual reason for cancellation revealed by numerous archived declassified documents was that the Army felt it was too unwieldy and diverted their efforts into a successor, Violet Vision, based on the smaller successor to Blue Danube, Red Beard. None were ever built, the Army instead receiving US ADMs or [[Atomic Demolition Munitions]] under the established procedures for supply of NATO allies from US stocks held in US custody in Europe. A sea mine based on the Blue Danube warhead and codenamed Cudgel was also envisaged for delivery by midget submarines, referred to by naval sources as "sneak craft"; perhaps reflecting a belief that these craft were really rather ungentlemanly methods of waging war. None were built.  . 

A gaseous diffusion plant was built at [[Capenhurst]], near [[Chester]] and started production in 1953 producing [[low enriched uranium]] (LEU). By 1957 it was capable of annually producing 125&nbsp;kg of [[highly enriched uranium]] (HEU). The capacity was further increased and by 1959 it may have been producing as much as 1600&nbsp;kg per year. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Uk/UKFacility.html |title=Britain's Nuclear Weapons - British Nuclear Testing |publisher=Nuclearweaponarchive.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-30}}</ref>  At the end of 1961, having produced between 3.8 and 4.9 [[tonne]]s of HEU it was switched over to LEU production for civil use. Additional plutonium production was provided by eight electricity generating [[Magnox]] reactors at [[Calder Hall nuclear power station|Calder Hall]] and [[Chapelcross]] which started operating in 1956 and 1959 respectively.  . 

===Thermonuclear weaponry===.

These bomb casings were used for all the air-drop tests at [[Kiritimati|Christmas Island]] and [[Maralinga]], Australia. Detonation was approximately 52 seconds after release from the aircraft.]]
A month after Britain's first atomic weapons test, [[Ivy Mike|America tested]] the first [[thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear bomb]], using hydrogen [[nuclear fusion]] instead of fission. The Soviets [[Joe 4|tested their first]] in 1953.{{r|gott1963}} Although Penney believed that Britain could not afford to develop a hydrogen bomb,{{r|spinardi199708}} officials believed that possessing the more powerful weapon would cause the United States to continue to view Britain as a "great power". The Churchill ministry decided on 27 July 1954 to begin development of a thermonuclear bomb and announced its plans in February 1955.{{r|gott1963}}{{r|spinardi199708}} . 

By then many argued in favour of a British [[nuclear deterrent]], not just nuclear weapons. Churchill stated in a speech that year that deterrence would be "the parents of disarmament" and that, unless Britain contributed to Western deterrence with its own weapons, during a war the targets that threatened it the most might not be prioritized. [[Harold Macmillan]] stated that nuclear weapons would give Britain influence over targeting and American policy, and would affect strategy in the Middle East and Far East. [[Duncan Sandys]] stated that nuclear weapons reduced Britain's dependence on the United States. There was little dissent in the House of Commons; nuclear weapons had almost bipartisan support until 1960. The Labour party supported British nuclear weapons but opposed tests, and Labour Opposition Leader [[Hugh Gaitskell]] agreed with Sandys on the importance of reducing dependence on the American deterrent.{{r|gott1963}} . 

The ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' and other newspapers critical of the Conservative government supported the British deterrent, although the ''Guardian'' did criticise the government for relying on developing bombers rather than missiles to carry the weapons. <ref>Lorna Arnold, Britain and the H-Bomb, the official history. Published 2001. Palgrave. ISBN 0-333-94742-8 and ISBN 0-312-23518-6 in North America, p65. </ref> In 1962 it stated that the forthcoming [[Chinese nuclear weapon]] was a reason for having more than one Western nuclear nation.{{r|gott1963}} ''[[The Economist]]'', the ''[[New Statesman]]'' and many left-wing newspapers supported the government's policy of nuclear deterrence as a means of reducing the size of conventional forces. Their view (in 1954-55) is fairly summarised as being not opposed to nuclear deterrence and nuclear weapons, but in their view that of the United States would suffice, and that of the costs of the 'nuclear umbrella' was best left to be borne by the United States alone. Their attitudes to nuclear weapons have changed somewhat since then. <ref>A.J.R.Groom, ''"British thinking about nuclear weapons"'', pps 131-154. Published Frances Pinter 1974. ISBN 0-903804-01-8. (Note that this is an old 10 digit ISBN, as used at publication in 1974)</ref> . 

The first prototype, Short Granite, was detonated on 15 May 1957 in [[Operation Grapple]], with disappointing results at {{convert|300|ktonTNT|PJ}}, when the target requirement was {{convert|1|MtonTNT|abbr=on}}. A further test of Purple Granite yielded less at {{convert|200|ktonTNT|PJ|abbr=on}}. Britain deployed an interim hydrogen weapon in the V-bomber fleet until a true thermonuclear weapon could be devised from the Christmas Island tests. This never tested interim weapon derived from the [[Orange Herald]] warhead tested on 31 May 1957 yielding {{convert|720|ktonTNT|PJ|abbr=on}}<ref>Lorna Arnold p147, ibid</ref> known as [[Green Grass]]. It was merely a very large unboosted pure fission weapon yielding {{convert|400|ktonTNT|PJ|abbr=on}}.  . 

After British scientists demonstrated to the United States in fall 1957, however, that they had developed a [[Teller-Ulam]] design different from American methods and thus understood how to build a hydrogen bomb, the [[1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement]] made fully developed and tested American designs available more quickly and more cheaply. The first of these was the US [[B28 nuclear bomb]], which was anglicised and manufactured in the UK as [[Red Snow]] and quickly deployed as [[Yellow Sun]] Mk.2 in the V-bomber fleet. Red Snow became the warhead of choice for the [[Blue Steel missile|Blue Steel]] stand-off missile and some of the [[GAM-87 Skybolt|Skybolt]] missiles intended for carriage by the V-bombers. (The American B28 design had reliability issues. The British soon withdrew their warheads from deployment, and never again simply copied an American design.){{r|spinardi199708}} Under the Mutual Defence Agreement 5.4 tonnes of UK produced plutonium was sent to the US in return for 6.7&nbsp;kg of [[tritium]] and 7.5 tonnes of [[highly enriched uranium|HEU]] over the period 1960-1979, replacing Capenhurst production, although much of the HEU was used not for weapons, but as fuel for the growing UK fleet of nuclear submarines, both of the Polaris variety and others numbering approx twelve.  . 

Fifty-eight Blue Danube bombs were produced, although archived declassified files indicate that only a small proportion of these were ever serviceable at any one time. It remained in service until 1963, when it was replaced by [[Red Beard (nuclear weapon)|Red Beard]], a smaller tactical [[boosted fission weapon]] that used the same fissile core as Blue Danube and was deployed on many smaller aircraft than the V-bombers, both ashore and at sea aboard five carriers. Stocks of Red Beard were maintained in [[Cyprus]], [[Singapore]], and a smaller number in the UK.

It was the largest pure fission weapon ever deployed by any nuclear state. Green Grass was deployed first in a modified Blue Danube casing and known as [[Violet Club]]. A later variant was deployed in a Yellow Sun Mk.1 casing.  . 

In 1962 and 1960 respectively the UK cancelled their Blue Steel extended range upgrade (Blue Steel Mk2)and [[Blue Streak missile|Blue Streak]] missile projects. It was asserted in Parliament at the time that the Blue Streak missiles were cancelled because of their vulnerability to Soviet attack as they were liquid fuelled an immobile, although this vulnerability was in fact negligible. However, the main aim in British policy had changed from one of independence to interdependence- subsequently the Macmillan Government favoured the purchase of Skybolt missiles from the United States to the continuation of an independent project. Similarly, reassessments of Soviet capabilities changed military perceptions and led to the removal of [[Project Emily|Thor IRBM missiles in the UK]]; and Jupiter IRBMs in Italy and Turkey; although the Turkish sites were implicated in an alleged deal following the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. To consternation, and considerable protests, the incoming [[Kennedy administration]] cancelled Skybolt at the end of 1962 because it was believed by the US [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of State for Defense]], [[Robert McNamara]], that other delivery systems were progressing better than expected, and a further expensive system was surplus to US requirements.  . 

[[File:Polaris-a1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris A1 or A2 missile]], seen here on a launch pad in [[Cape Canaveral]], was a [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]] purchased from the US. The UK purchased the A3T variant, the final production model, that incorporated hardened missile electronic components to resist ABM attack in the boost phase, although neither the three re-entry vehicles or UK-manufactured warheads were hardened, leading to the Chevaline programme.]] . 

===Polaris===. 
{{Main|Polaris Sales Agreement|UGM-27 Polaris|Chevaline|Resolution class submarine}} . 

After the cancellation of Skybolt, the UK purchased [[Polaris ballistic missile|Polaris]] missiles for use in UK-built ballistic missile submarines. The agreement between US President [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Harold Macmillan]], the [[Polaris Sales Agreement]], was announced on 21 December 1962 and [[HMS Resolution (S22)|HMS ''Resolution'']] made her first Polaris-armed operational patrol on 15 June 1968. <ref>[http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/187295524X Amazon.co.uk review], The Impact of Polaris: The Origins of Britain's Seaborne Nuclear Deterrent, J.E. Moore. </ref> In the 1970s the UK Polaris RVs and warheads were vulnerable to the Soviet [[anti-ballistic missile|ABM]] screen concentrated around Moscow, and the UK developed a Polaris improved-front-end (IFE) codenamed [[Chevaline]], designed to counter this ABM defence which threatened to completely nullify an independent UK deterrent posture. When Chevaline became public knowledge in 1980, it generated huge controversy as it had been kept secret by the four governments of Wilson, Heath, Wilson (again) and Callaghan, whilst costs rocketed; admittedly during a period of high inflation; until disclosed by the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]]. By the time it entered service in 1982 it had cost approx Â£1bn. The final Polaris/Chevaline patrol took place in 1996, two years after the first Trident-carrying submarine sailed on its first patrol.  . 

As well as the establishment at Aldermaston, the UK nuclear weapons programme also has a factory at [[Burghfield]] nearby which assembled the weapons and is responsible for their maintenance, and had another in [[Cardiff]] which fabricated non-fissile components and a 2000 acre (8&nbsp;kmÂ²) test range at [[Foulness]]. Since 1993 the sites have been managed by private consortia. The Foulness and Cardiff facilities closed in October 1996 and February 1997 respectively.  . 

===Trident===. 
{{Main|UK Trident programme}}
[[File:Trident II missile image.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Trident missile]] launched from a [[ballistic missile submarine]].]]
[[File:HMS Vanguard April 1994.jpg|thumb|right|[[HMS Vanguard (S28)|HMS ''Vanguard'']], one of four ''Vanguard'' class ballistic missile submarines of the Royal Navy, which serve as the [[UK]]'s nuclear delivery system.]]
[[File:We177 science museum.jpg|thumb|right|[[WE.177]] air-launched [[nuclear bomb]]]]
The UK currently has four [[Vanguard class submarine|''Vanguard'' class]] submarines based at [[HMNB Clyde]] in [[Scotland]], armed with nuclear-tipped [[Trident missile]]s. The principle of operation is based on maintaining deterrent effect by always having at least one submarine at sea, and was designed for the [[Cold War]] period. One submarine is normally undergoing maintenance and the remaining two in port or on training exercises. It has been suggested that the UK's ballistic missile submarine patrols are coordinated with those of the [[France and weapons of mass destruction|French]]. <ref>Norris, Robert S. , William M. Arkin, [[Hans M. Kristensen]], and Joshua Handler ,"[http://thebulletin.metapress.com/content/b88603213q7r43vp/fulltext.pdf British nuclear forces, 2001]", Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists , vol. 57, no. 06, pp. 78-79. {{issn|0096-3402}} {{doi|10.2968/057006025}} (November/December 2001)</ref> . 

Each submarine carries 16 [[Trident II]] D-5 missiles, which can each carry up to twelve warheads. However, the UK government announced in 1998 that each submarine would carry only 48 warheads, an increase of 50% over the 32 warheads carried by Trident's predecessor, Chevaline, (halving the limit specified by the previous government), which is an average of three per missile. However one or two missiles per submarine are probably armed with fewer warheads for "sub-strategic" use causing others to be armed with more; but this is speculative.  . 

The UK-designed warheads are thought to be selectable between 0.3, 5-10 and 100 kt (1.3, 21â€“42 and 420&nbsp;TJ); the yields obtained using either the unboosted primary, the boosted primary, or the entire "physics package"; although it must be stressed that these yields and similar data are entirely speculative. The true position is unlikely to be known with certainty for many years; as was the case with the misplaced speculation about the earlier Chevaline programme; only now becoming publicly known. Although the UK designed, manufactured and owns the warheads, there is evidence that the warhead design is similar to, or even based on, the US [[W76]] warhead fitted in some US Navy Trident missiles, with design data being supplied by the United States through the [[1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2006/12/britains_next_nuclear_era_1.php|title=Britain's Next Nuclear Era|publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]]|date=December 7, 2006|accessdate=2007-03-15 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070206035127/http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2006/12/britains_next_nuclear_era_1.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-02-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/images/W76req.pdf|format=PDF|title=Stockpile Stewardship Plan: Second Annual Update (FY 1999)|publisher=[[US Department of Energy]]|month=April | year=1998|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref> The United Kingdom owns 58 missiles which are shared in a joint pool with the [[United States government]] and these are exchanged when requiring maintenance with missiles from the [[United States Navy]]'s own pool and vice versa.  . 

Until August 1998, the UK also retained the [[WE.177]] nuclear weapon manufactured in the mid-1960s to late 1970s, in air-dropped free-fall bomb and [[depth charge]] versions. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://nuclear-weapons.info/images/RAF-nuclear-frontline-Order-of-Battle-1966-94.PNG |title=RAF nuclear frontline Order-of-Battle 1966-94 |date= |accessdate=2010-07-30}}</ref> This left the four ''Vanguard'' class submarines, which replaced the Polaris ones in the early 1990s, as the United Kingdom's only nuclear weapons platform. It has been estimated by the [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] that the United Kingdom has built around 1,200 warheads since the first [[Operation Hurricane|Hurricane]] device of 1952. In terms of number of warheads, the UK arsenal was at its maximum size of about 350 in the 1970s, but this figure does not include the large numbers of US-owned warheads, bombs, nuclear depth bombs supplied from US stocks in Europe for use by NATO allies. At its peak, these numbered 327 for the [[British Army of the Rhine]] in Germany alone.  . 

==Replacement for Trident==. 
{{Main|British replacement of the Trident system}} . 

A decision on the replacement of Trident was made on 4 December 2006. [[Tony Blair]] ([[Prime Minister]] at that time) told MPs it would be "unwise and dangerous" for the UK to give up its nuclear weapons. He outlined plans to spend up to Â£20bn on a new generation of submarines for Trident missiles.  . 

He said submarine numbers may be cut from four to three, while the number of nuclear warheads would be cut by 20% to 160. Mr Blair said although the Cold War had ended, the UK needed nuclear weapons, as no-one could be sure another nuclear threat would not emerge in the future.  . 

==Deployment of US tactical nuclear weapons==. 
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
Until 1992 UK forces also deployed US tactical nuclear weapons as part of a US-UK dual-key [[NATO]] [[nuclear sharing]] role. <ref>[http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199293/cmhansrd/1993-06-22/Orals-1.html#Orals-1_spnew9 Nuclear Weapons - Mr. Hanley], Hansard, 22 June 1993 : Column 154</ref><ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/osp11.pdf#page=11 Operational Selection Policy OSP 11, Nuclear Weapons Policy 1967-1998], [[The National Archives]], November 2005</ref> This arrangement commenced in 1958 as [[Project E]] to provide nuclear weapons to the RAF prior to a sufficient number of Britain's own nuclear weapons becoming available.  .

The Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE), Aldermaston (formerly the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment, Aldermaston) is situated just {{convert|7|mi|0}} north of [[Basingstoke]] and approximately {{convert|14|mi}} south-west of [[Reading, Berkshire]], near a village called [[Aldermaston]], bordering with [[Tadley]]. It was built in 1949 on the site of a former [[World War II]] [[Royal Air Force]] base and converted to nuclear weapons research, design and development in the 1950s. Although some early test devices were probably assembled on this site, final assembly of Service-engineered weapons takes place at the nearby site of Burghfield.  .

[[ROF Cardiff]], which closed in 1997, was involved in nuclear weapons programmes since 1961.

==Politics, decision making and nuclear posture==. 
===Anti-nuclear movement===. 
{{Main|Anti-nuclear movement in the United Kingdom}} 
[[Image:Peace symbol.svg|right|thumb|The now-familiar [[peace symbol]] was originally the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] logo.]] . 

The anti-nuclear movement in the United Kingdom consists of groups who oppose nuclear technologies such as [[nuclear power]] and [[nuclear weapons]]. Many different groups and individuals have been involved in [[anti-nuclear protests|anti-nuclear demonstrations and protests]] over the years.  . 

One of the most prominent anti-nuclear groups in the UK is the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND).  CND's [[Aldermaston March]]es began in 1958 and continued into the late 1960s when tens of thousands of people took part in the four-day marches. One significant anti-nuclear mobilisation in the 1980s was the [[Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp]]. In London, in October 1983, more than 300,000 people assembled in Hyde Park as part of the largest protest against nuclear weapons in British history. In 2005 in Britain, there were many protests about the government's proposal to replace the aging [[UK Trident programme|Trident weapons system]] with a newer model.  . 

===Nuclear posture===. 
UK nuclear posture during the cold war was informed by interdependence with the United States. Operational control of the UK Polaris force was assigned to SACLANT, while targeting policy for its missiles was determined, as for the V-bomber force before it, by NATO's SACEUR, while maintaining an independent wholly UK targeting policy for some circumstances when a critical national emergency required it to be used alone, without the UK's NATO allies. <ref>PRO, London, DEFE 25/335, E93 classified until 2010, obtained Jan 2006 using the FOI Act. </ref><ref>PRO, London, T225/3280, E32. </ref> In these circumstances, the '[[Moscow criterion]]' referred to the ability of the UK to strike back at the highly centralised Soviet decision-making apparatus concentrated in the Moscow area, intended to destroy the ability of the Soviet leadership to remain in control of a Soviet Union otherwise untouched. The early beginnings of studies to increase the likelihood of successful penetration of the Polaris warheads to Moscow can be traced back to 1964,<ref>Kate Pyne, The AWRE Contribution to Chevaline. Proceedings of the Royal Aeronautical Society Symposium on Chevaline, 2004. Published 2005 as ISBN 1-85768-109-6</ref> before the Polaris system was deployed, in order to preserve this capability in the face of anti-ballistic missile batteries around Moscow. These studies later materialised as Chevaline. <ref>PRO, London, DEFE 25/335, E44 Annex A, 'Unacceptable Damage', plus maps. Classified until 2010, and obtained Jan 2006 using the FOI Act. </ref><ref>British Nuclear Doctrine: The 'Moscow Criterion' and the Polaris Improvement Programme, John Baylis, Contemporary British History, Vol. 19, No. 1, Spring 2005, pp.53-65</ref> . 

The UK has relaxed its nuclear posture since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government's 1998 [[Strategic Defence Review]] made a number of reductions from the plans announced by the previous [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government:<ref>http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyes/65F3D7AC-4340-4119-93A2-20825848E50E/0/sdr1998_complete.pdf</ref>
*The stockpile of ''"operationally available warheads"'' was reduced from 300 to ''"less than 200"''
*The final batch of missile bodies would not be purchased, limiting the fleet to 58. 
*A submarine's load of warheads were reduced from 96 to 48. This reduced the explosive power of the warheads on a Vanguard class Trident submarine to ''"one third less than a Polaris submarine armed with Chevaline."'' However 48 warheads per Trident submarine represents a 50% increase on the 32 warheads per submarine of Chevaline. Total explosive power has been in decline for decades as the accuracy of missiles has improved, therefore requiring less power to destroy each target. Trident can destroy 48 targets per submarine, as opposed to 32 targets that could be destroyed by Chevaline. 
*Submarines missiles would not be targeted, but rather at several days "notice to fire". 
*Although one submarine would always be on patrol it will operate on a "reduced day-to-day alert state". A major factor in maintaining a constant patrol is to avoid ''"misunderstanding or escalation if a Trident submarine were to sail during a period of crisis."'' . 

Current UK posture as outlined in the Strategic Defence Review of 1998<ref>http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyre/65F3D7AC-4340-4119-93A2-20825848E/0?sdr1998_complete.pdf</ref> is as it has been for many years. Only the delivery methods have changed. Trident SLBMs still provide the long-range strategic element as they have done for some years. Until 1998 the free-fall WE.177A, WE.177B and WE.177C bombs provided an aircraft-delivered sub-strategic option in addition to their designed function of tactical battlefield weapons. With the retirement of WE.177, a sub-strategic warhead is stated by Ministers to be incorporated into some (but not all) Trident missiles deployed. The exact mix of weapons on each submarine is unknown as is the numbers and warhead yield. Current UK thinking{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} is that the capacity to launch a very limited strike is a more credible deterrent in the current world situation than use of a MIRVed strategic system.  . 

===Nuclear weapons control===. 
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}} . 

The precise details of how a British Prime Minister would authorise a nuclear strike remain secret, although the principles of the Trident control system is believed to be based on the plan set up for Polaris in 1968, which has now been declassified. A closed-circuit television system was set up between 10 Downing Street and the Polaris Control Officer at the [[Northwood Headquarters]] of the Royal Navy. Both the Prime Minister and the Polaris Control Officer would be able to see each other on their monitors when the command was given. If the link failed â€“ for instance during a nuclear attack or when the PM was away from Downing Street â€“ the Prime Minister would send an authentication code which could be verified at Northwood. The Commander in Chief would then broadcast a firing order to the Polaris submarines via the Very Low Frequency radio station at Rugby. The UK has not deployed control equipment requiring codes to be sent before weapons can be used, such as the U.S. [[Permissive Action Link]], which if installed would preclude the possibility that military officers could launch British nuclear weapons without authorisation.  . 

[[File:WE.177 safety keys.jpg|thumb|right|WE.177 safety and arming keys]]
Until 1998, when it was withdrawn from service, the WE.177 bomb was armed with a standard [[tubular pin tumbler lock]] (as used on bicycle locks) and a standard [[allen key]] was used to set yield and burst height. Currently, British Trident commanders are able to launch their missiles without authorisation, whereas their American colleagues cannot. At the end of the Cold War the U.S. Fail Safe Commission recommended installing devices to prevent rogue commanders persuading their crews to launch unauthorised nuclear attacks. This was endorsed by the Nuclear Posture Review and Trident Coded Control Devices  were fitted to all U.S. SSBNs by 1997. These devices prevented an attack until a launch code had been sent by the Chiefs of Staff on behalf of the President. The UK took a decision not to install Trident CCDs or their equivalent on the grounds that an aggressor might be able to wipe out the British chain of command before a launch order had been sent. <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7097121.stm|title=Nuclear weapons security - MoD statement|author=[[Ministry of Defence (UK)]]|date=15 November 2007|publisher=BBC [[Newsnight]]|accessdate=2008-05-19}}</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/avdb/news/uk/video/133000/bb/133417_16x9_bb.asx British nuclear weapon control] (streaming video), [[Susan Watts]], [[BBC]] [[Newsnight]], November 2007</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/11_november/15/newsnight.shtml |title=BBC press release November 2007 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2007-11-15 |accessdate=2010-07-30}}</ref> . 

In December 2008 BBC Radio 4 made a programme titled ''The Human Button'', providing new information on the manner in which the United Kingdom could launch its nuclear weapons, particularly relating to safeguards against a rogue launch.  Former [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Defence Staff]] (most senior officer of all [[British armed forces]]) and [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the General Staff]] (most senior officer in the [[British Army]]), General [[Charles Guthrie, Baron Guthrie of Craigiebank|Lord Guthrie of Craigiebank]], explained that the highest level of safeguard was against a [[prime minister]] ordering a launch without due cause:  Lord Guthrie stated that the constitutional structure of the United Kingdom provided some protection against such an occurrence, as while the Prime Minister is the chief executive and so practically commands the armed services, the ultimate commander-in-chief is the [[British monarchy|Monarch]], to whom the chief of the defence staff could appeal:
''"the chief of the defence staff, if he really did think the prime minister had gone mad, would make quite sure that that order was not obeyed... You have to remember that actually prime ministers give direction, they tell the chief of the defence staff what they want, but it's not prime ministers who actually tell a sailor to press a button in the middle of the Atlantic.  The armed forces are loyal, and we live in a democracy, but actually their ultimate authority is the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]]."''<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7758314.stm | work=BBC News | title=Whose hand is on the button? | date=2 December 2008 | accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref> . 

The same interview pointed out that while the Prime Minister would have the constitutional authority to fire the Chief of the Defence Staff, he could not appoint a replacement as the position is appointed by the monarch. During the Cold War the Prime Minister was also required to name a senior member of the cabinet as his/her designated-survivor, who would have the authority to order a nuclear response in the event of an attack incapacitating the Prime Minister, and this system was re-adopted after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States.  . 

The programme also addressed the workings of the system; detailing that [[two-man rule|two persons are required]] to authenticate each stage of the process before launching, with the submarine captain only able to access the firing trigger after two safes have been opened with keys held by the ship's executive and [[weapons engineering]] officers. It was explained that all prime ministers issue hand-written orders, termed the [[letters of last resort]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rosenbaum |first=Ron |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2009 |month=January |title=The Letter of Last Resort |journal=Slate Magazine |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2208219/pagenum/all |accessdate=2009-05-18 |quote=In the control room of the sub, the Daily Mail reports, "there is a safe attached to a control room floor. Inside that, there is an inner safe. And inside that sits a letter.

Although the final orders of the Prime Minister are at his or her discretion, and no fixed options exist, four known options are often presented to prime ministers by military advisers when writing such notes of last resort: (i) Captain ordered to respond to the nuclear attack on the UK by launching submarine's nuclear weapons; (ii) Captain ordered not to respond with nuclear weapons; (iii) Captain ordered to use own judgement whether to return fire with nuclear weapons; (iv) Captain ordered to place himself and ship under the command of [[Government of Australia|Her Majesty's Government in Australia]], or alternatively of the [[President of the United States]].  This system of issuing notes containing orders in the event of the head of government's death is said to be unique to the United Kingdom (although the concept of written last orders, particularly of a ship's captain, is a naval tradition), with other nuclear powers using different procedures.  Such orders are destroyed unopened whenever a prime minister leaves office, so the decision of its use or not by previous prime ministers are known only to them - however, all relevant former prime ministers have supported an "independent nuclear deterrent", as does incumbent [[David Cameron]]. <ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5103764.stm | work=BBC News | title=Brown backs Trident replacement | date=21 June 2006 | accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref> Only former prime minister [[Lord Callaghan]] has given any insight on his orders: Callaghan stated that, although in a situation where nuclear weapon use was required - and thus the whole purpose and value of the weapon as a deterrent had failed - he would have ordered use of nuclear weapons, if needed: ''...if we had got to that point, where it was, I felt it was necessary to do it, then I would have done it (used the weapon)...but if I had lived after pressing that button, I could have never forgiven myself.''<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7758000/7758347.stm | work=BBC News | title=Finger on the nuclear button | date=2 December 2008 | accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref> .

The 1958 'Agreement For Cooperation on the Uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defence Purposes' also known as the 'Mutual Defence Agreement'  was renewed in 1994 and again in 2005. <ref>US-UK nuclear weapons collaboration under the Mutual Defence Agreement, Nigel Chamberlain, Nicola Butler and Dave Andrews, British American Security Council, June 2004</ref> . 

===Cost===. 
The current Trident system cost Â£12.6bn (at 1996 prices) and costs Â£280m a year to maintain. Options for replacing Trident range from Â£5bn for the missiles alone to Â£20-30bn for missiles, submarines and research facilities. At minimum, for the system to continue safely after around 2020, the missiles will need to be replaced. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/Economy/200506130008 |title=Trident: the done deal |publisher=New Statesman |date= |accessdate=2010-07-30}}</ref> .

===The Case For===. 
After the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] announced its plans to refurbish its [[UK Trident programme|Trident]] [[Submarine-launched ballistic missile|SLBM]] missiles and build new submarines to carry them,<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmdfence/ucwhite/ucmemo.htm Memoranda on the Future of the UK's Strategic Nuclear Deterent: the White Paper] to the House of Commons Defence Committee</ref> it published a [[white paper]] ''The Future of the United Kingdomâ€™s Nuclear Deterrent'' in which it stated that the renewal is fully compatible with the United Kingdom's treaty commitments and international law. <ref>[http://www.fco.gov.uk/Files/kfile/White%20Paper%20Nuclear%20Deterrent.pdf The Future of the United Kingdomâ€™s Nuclear Deterrent](pdf) December 2006:</ref> These arguments are summarised in a question and answer briefing published by [[Conference on Disarmament|UK Permanent Representative to the Conference on Disarmament]]<ref>[http://www.britishembassy.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&c=Page&cid=1163677931589 Britain's Nuclear Deterrent] by [[Conference on Disarmament|UK Permanent Representative to the Conference on Disarmament]]</ref>

At the start of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] debate to authorise the replacement of Trident,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2007-03-14c.298.0|date=14 March 2007|title=Trident|publisher=Hansard}}</ref> [[Margaret Beckett]] stated: .

We have been disarming. Since the Cold War ended, we have withdrawn and dismantled our tactical maritime and airborne nuclear capabilities. We have terminated our nuclear capable Lance missiles and artillery. We have the smallest nuclear capability of any recognised nuclear weapon state accounting for less than one per cent of the global inventory. And we are the only nuclear weapon state that relies on a single nuclear system.}} . 

The subsequent vote was won overwhelmingly, including unanimous support from the opposition [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6448173.stm|publisher=BBC NEWS|title=Trident plan wins Commons support|date=15 March 2007}}</ref> . 

The Government position remains that it is abiding by the NPT legally in renewing Trident and Britain has the right to possess nuclear weapons, a position reiterated by [[Tony Blair]] in PMQs on 21 February 2007. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acronym.org.uk/dd/dd84/84news01.htm|publisher=Disarmament Diplomacy| title=Blair wins Trident vote after telling UK Parliament that the NPT gives Britain the Right to have nuclear weapons|date=Spring 2007}}</ref> .

===The Case Against===. 
One view is that the white paper ''The Future of the United Kingdomâ€™s Nuclear Deterrent'' stands in contrast to two [[legal opinion|counsel's opinion]]s. The first, commissioned by [[Peacerights]],<ref>[http://www.peacerights.org/aboutus.php Peacerights] [http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmdfence/ucwhite/ucm1002.htm Memorandum from Peacerights]</ref> was given on 19 December 2005 by [[Rabinder Singh (barrister)|Rabinder Singh]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] and [[Professor]] [[Christine Chinkin]] of Matrix Chambers. It addressed '...whether Trident or a likely replacement to Trident breaches [[customary international law]]'<ref name="peacerights195">Singh, Rabinder; and  Chinkin, Christine; [http://www.peacerights.org/reports/195 The Maintenance and Possible Replacement of the Trident Nuclear Missile System Introduction and Summary of Advice] for Peacerights (paragraph 1 and 2)</ref> . 

Drawing on the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) [[International Court of Justice advisory opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons|opinion]], Singh and Chinkin advised that:
{{quotation|The use of the Trident system would breach customary international law, in particular because it would infringe the "intransgressible" [principles of international customary law] requirement that a distinction must be drawn between combatants and non-combatants. <ref name="peacerights195" />}} . 

The second opinion was commissioned by [[Greenpeace]]<ref>Greenpeace [http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/contentlookup.cfm?&ucidparam=20061123104513 Trident replacement may be illegal under international law]</ref> and given by [[Philippe Sands]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] and [[Helen Law]], also of [[Matrix Chambers]], on 13 November 2006. <ref>Sands, Philippe; and Law, Helen; [http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/MultimediaFiles/Live/FullReport/8072.pdf The United Kingdom's nuclear deterrent:Current and future issies of legality] (see [[#References|References]])</ref> The opinion addressed . 

{{quotation|The compatibility with international law, in particular the [[jus ad bellum]], [[international humanitarian law]] (â€˜IHLâ€™) and Article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (â€˜NPTâ€™), of the current UK strategy on the use of Trident...The compatibility with IHL of deploying the current Trident system...[and] the compatibility with IHL and Article VI NPT of the following options for replacing or upgrading Trident: (a) Enhanced targeting capability; (b) Increased yield flexibility; (c) Renewal of the current capability over a longer period. <ref>Sands, Philippe; and Law, Helen; [[#References|References]], paragraph 1</ref>}} . 

With regards to the ''jus ad bellum'', Sands and Law advised that . 

{{quotation|Given the devastating consequences inherent in the use of the UKâ€™s current nuclear weapons, we are of the view that the [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]] test is unlikely to be met except where there is a threat to the very survival of the state. In our view, the â€˜vital interestsâ€™ of the UK as defined in the [[Strategic Defence Review]] are considerably broader than those whose destruction threaten the survival of the state. The use of nuclear weapons to protect such interests is likely to be disproportionate and therefore unlawful under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. <ref>Sands, Philippe; and Law, Helen; [[#References|References]], paragraph 4(i)</ref>}} . 

The phrase "very survival of the state" is a direct quote from paragraph 97 of the ICJ ruling. With regards to international humanitarian law, they advised that . 

{{quotation|it [is] hard to envisage any scenario in which the use of Trident, as currently constituted, could be consistent with the IHL prohibitions on indiscriminate attacks and unnecessary suffering. Further, such use would be highly likely to result in a violation of the principle of neutrality. <ref>Sands, Philippe; and Law, Helen; [[#References|References]], paragraph 4(iii)</ref>}} . 

Finally, with reference to the NPT, Sands and Law advised that . 

{{quotation|A broadening of the deterrence policy to incorporate prevention of nonnuclear attacks so as to justify replacing or upgrading Trident would appear to be inconsistent with Article VI; b) Attempts to justify Trident upgrade or replacement as an insurance against unascertainable future threats would appear to be inconsistent with Article VI; c) Enhancing the targeting capability or yield flexibility of the Trident system is likely to be inconsistent with Article VI; d) Renewal or replacement of Trident at the same capability is likely to be inconsistent with Article VI; and e) In each case such inconsistency could give rise to a material breach of the NPT. <ref>Sands, Philippe; and Law, Helen; [[#References|References]], paragraph 4(iv)</ref>}} .
