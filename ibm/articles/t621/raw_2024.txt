{{Weapons of mass destruction}} . 

A '''weapon of mass destruction''' ('''WMD''') is a [[weapon]] that can kill and bring significant harm to a large number of humans (and other life forms) and/or cause great damage to man-made structures (e.g. buildings), natural structures (e.g. mountains), or the [[biosphere]] in general. The scope and application of the term has evolved and been disputed, often signifying more politically than technically. Coined in reference to [[strategic bombing|aerial bombing]] with [[Explosive material#Chemical explosives|chemical explosive]]s, it has come to distinguish large-scale weaponry of other technologies, such as [[chemical warfare|chemical]], [[biological warfare|biological]], [[radiological weapon|radiological]], or [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]]. This differentiates the term from more technical ones such as [[Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear|chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons (CBRN)]].  . 

==Early uses of the term weapon of mass destruction==. 
The first use of the term "weapon of mass destruction" on record is by [[Cosmo Gordon Lang]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], in 1937 in reference to the aerial [[Bombing of Guernica|bombardment]] of [[Guernica (town)|Guernica]], Spain: . 

{{cquote|Who can think at this present time without a sickening of the heart of the appalling slaughter, the suffering, the manifold misery brought by war [[Spanish Civil War|to Spain]] and [[Second Sino-Japanese War|to China]]? Who can think without horror of what another widespread war would mean, waged as it would be with all the new weapons of mass destruction?<ref>"Archbishop's Appeal," ''Times'' (London), 28 December 1937, p. 9. </ref>}} . 

At that time, there were no [[nuclear weapons]], Japan conducted research on [[biological weapons]] (see [[Unit 731]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/japan/bw/ |title=Biological Weapons Program – Japan |publisher=Fas.org |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> and [[chemical weapons]] had seen wide use, most notably in World War I.  . 

Following the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], and progressing through the [[Cold War]], the term came to refer more to non-[[conventional weapon]]s. The application of the term to specifically nuclear and [[radiological weapons]] is traced by [[William Safire]] to the Russian phrase "Оружие массового поражения" – ''oruzhiye massovogo porazheniya'' (weapons of mass destruction).  . 

He credits James Goodby (of the [[Brookings Institution]]) with tracing what he considers the earliest known English-language use soon after the nuclear bombing of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] (although it is not quite verbatim): a communique from a 15 November 1945, meeting of [[Harry Truman]], [[Clement Attlee]] and [[Mackenzie King]] (probably drafted by [[Vannevar Bush]]– or so Bush claimed in 1970) referred to "weapons adaptable to mass destruction".  . 

That exact phrase, says Safire, was also used by [[Bernard Baruch]] in 1946 (in a speech at the United Nations probably written by [[Herbert Bayard Swope]]). <ref>"Weapons of Mass Destruction", ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'', 19 April 1998, p.22. Retrieved 24 February 2007. </ref> The same phrase found its way into the very first resolution adopted by the United Nations General assembly in January 1946 in London, which used the wording "...the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and of all other weapons adaptable to mass destruction."<ref>http://www.un.org/disarmament/WMD/Nuclear/</ref>  This resolution also created the [[United Nations Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (predecessor of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency|International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)]]).  . 

An exact use of this term was given in a lecture "[[nuclear reaction|Atomic Energy]] as an Atomic Problem" by [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]. The lecture was delivered to the [[United States Foreign Service|Foreign Service]] and the [[State Department]], on 17 September 1947. The lecture is reprinted in ''The Open Mind'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1955). <blockquote>''"It is a very far reaching control which would eliminate the rivalry between nations in this field, which would prevent the surreptitious arming of one nation against another, which would provide some cushion of time before atomic attack, and presumably therefore before any attack with weapons of mass destruction, and which would go a long way toward removing atomic energy at least as a source of conflict between the powers".''</blockquote> . 

The term was also used in the introduction to the hugely influential US Government Document known as [[NSC-68]] written in April 1950. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/nsc-hst/nsc-68.htm |title=NSC-68 United States Objectives and Programs for National Security |publisher=Fas.org |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> . 

During a televised presentation about the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] on 22 October 1962, [[John F. Kennedy]] made reference to "offensive weapons of sudden mass destruction. <ref>Kennedy JF (1962-10-22). [[wikisource:Cuban Missile Crisis|Televised remarks to the American people re "the Soviet military buildup on the island of Cuba"]]</ref> " . 

An early use of the exact phrase in an [[international treaty]] was in the [[Outer Space Treaty]] of 1967, however no definition was provided.  . 

=== Evolution of its use ===. 
During the [[Cold War]], the term "weapons of mass destruction" was primarily a reference to nuclear weapons. At the time, in the [[Western world#Modern political|West]] the euphemism "strategic weapons" was used to refer to the American nuclear arsenal, which was presented as a necessary deterrent against nuclear or conventional attack from the [[Soviet Union]] (see [[Mutual Assured Destruction]]).  . 

The term "weapons of mass destruction" continued to see periodic use throughout this time, usually in the context of nuclear [[arms control]]; [[Ronald Reagan]] used it during the 1986 [[Reykjavík Summit]], when referring to the 1967 [[Outer Space Treaty]]. <ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080518185704/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/episodes/22/documents/reykjavik/ CNN Cold War – Historical Documents: Reagan-Gorbachev transcripts]</ref> Reagan's successor, [[George H.W. Bush]], used the term in an 1989 speech to the United Nations, using it primarily in reference to chemical arms. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1DE153CF935A1575AC0A96F948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |title=Excerpts From Bush's Speech at the Opening of the U.N. General Assembly – |location=Union Of Soviet Socialist Republics (Ussr) |work=New York Times |date=26 September 1989 |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> . 

The end of the Cold War reduced U.S. reliance on nuclear weapons as a deterrent, causing it to shift its focus to disarmament. This period coincided with an increasing threat to U.S. interests from Islamic nations and independent Islamic groups. With the 1990 [[invasion of Kuwait]] and 1991 [[Gulf War]], Iraq's nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons programs became a particular concern of the first [[Presidency of George H. W. Bush|Bush Administration]]. <ref>{{cite news|author=By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE3DD1130F933A0575AC0A966958260 |title=Confrontation in the Gulf; U.S. Explores New Strategies to Limit Weapons of Mass Destruction – |location=IRAQ |work=New York Times |date=30 September 1990 |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> Following the war, [[Bill Clinton]] and other western politicians and media continued to use the term, usually in reference to ongoing attempts to dismantle Iraq's [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons programs]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} . 

After the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] and the [[2001 anthrax attacks]], an increased fear of non-conventional weapons and [[asymmetrical warfare]] took hold of the United States and other Western powers. This fear reached a crescendo with the 2002 [[Iraq disarmament crisis]] and the [[Niger uranium forgeries|alleged existence]] of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq that became the primary justification for the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. However, no WMD were found in Iraq.  . 

Because of its prolific use during this period, the [[American Dialect Society]] voted "weapons of mass destruction" (and its abbreviation, "WMD") the [[Word of the Year|word of the year]] in 2002,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americandialect.org/index.php/amerdial/2002_words_of_the_y/ |title=American Dialect Society |publisher=Americandialect.org |date=13 January 2003 |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> and in 2003 [[Lake Superior State University]] added WMD to its list of terms banished for "''Mis-use, Over-use and General Uselessness''". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lssu.edu/banished/archive/2003.php |title=Lake Superior State University:: Banished Words List:: 2003 |publisher=Lssu.edu |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> . 

==Definitions of the term==. 
===United States===. 
====Strategic====. 
The most widely used definition of "weapons of mass destruction" is that of nuclear, biological or chemical weapons (NBC) although there is no [[treaty]] or customary [[international law]] that contains an authoritative definition. Instead, international law has been used with respect to the specific categories of weapons within WMD, and not to WMD as a whole.  . 

The abbreviations NBC (for nuclear, biological and chemical) or CBR (chemical, biological, radiological) are used with regards to battlefield protection systems for [[armored vehicles]], because all three involve insidious toxins that can be carried through the air and can be protected against with vehicle [[air filtration]] systems.  . 

However, there is an argument that nuclear and biological weapons do not belong in the same category as chemical and "[[dirty bomb]]" radiological weapons, which have limited destructive potential (and close to none, as far as property is concerned), whereas nuclear and biological weapons have the unique ability to kill large numbers of people with very small amounts of material, and thus could be said to belong in a class by themselves.  . 

The NBC definition has also been used in official U.S. documents, by the [[President of the United States|U.S. President]],<ref>http://nti.org/f_wmd411/f1a1_letter.html</ref><ref>http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2001_presidential_documents&docid=pd14my01_txt-9.pdf</ref> the [[CIA|U.S. Central Intelligence Agency]],<ref>[http://www.odci.gov/cia/reports/721_reports/jan_jun2003.htm CIA Site Redirect{{spaced ndash}}Central Intelligence Agency<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]],<ref>[http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/prolif97/message.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/ptr20010110.pdf ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> and the [[Government Accountability Office|U.S. Government Accountability Office]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=gao&docid=f:d01582.pdf |title=Weapons of Mass Destruction: State Department Oversight of Science Centers Program |format=PDF |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> . 

Other documents expand the definition of WMD to also include radiological or [[conventional weapon]]s. The [[US military|U.S. military]] refers to WMD as:
:''Chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons capable of a high order of destruction or causing mass casualties and exclude the means of transporting or propelling the weapon where such means is a separable and divisible part from the weapon. Also called WMD.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/ |title=Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms |publisher=Dtic.mil |date=12 April 2001 |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> . 

The significance of the words ''separable and divisible part of the weapon'' is that missiles such as the [[Pershing II]] and the [[SCUD]] are considered weapons of mass destruction, while aircraft capable of carrying bombloads are not.  . 

In 2004, the United Kingdom's [[Butler Review]] recognized the "considerable and long-standing academic debate about the proper interpretation of the phrase ‘weapons of mass destruction’". The committee set out to avoid the general term but when using it, employed the definition of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 687]], which defined the systems which Iraq was required to abandon:
* "Nuclear weapons or nuclear-weapons-usable material or any sub-systems or components or any research, development, support or manufacturing facilities relating to [nuclear weapons]. 
* Chemical and biological weapons and all stocks of agents and all related subsystems and components and all research,development,support and manufacturing facilities. 
* Ballistic missiles with a range greater than 150 kilometres and related major parts, and repair and production facilities."<ref>''[http://archive.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/butlerreview/report/index.asp Review of Intelligence on Weapons of Mass Destruction: Report of a Committee of Privy Counsellors]'' (HC 898), London: The Stationery Office, 2004, §14. </ref> . 

Chemical weapons expert Gert G. Harigel considers only nuclear weapons true weapons of mass destruction, because "only nuclear weapons are completely indiscriminate by their explosive power, heat radiation and radioactivity, and only they should therefore be called a weapon of mass destruction". He prefers to call chemical and biological weapons "weapons of terror" when aimed against civilians and "weapons of intimidation" for soldiers.  . 

Testimony of one such soldier expresses the same viewpoint. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sightm1911.com/lib/other/nbc.htm |title=A Soldier's Viewpoint on Surviving Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Attacks |publisher=Sightm1911.com |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> For a period of several months in the winter of 2002–2003, [[US Deputy Secretary of Defense|U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Paul Wolfowitz]] frequently used the term "weapons of mass terror," apparently also recognizing the distinction between the psychological and the physical effects of many things currently falling into the WMD category.  . 

[[Gustavo Bell Lemus]], the Vice President of [[Colombia]], at the 2001 United Nations [[Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects]], quoted the [[Millennium Report]] of the [[Secretary General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]] to the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]], in which [[Kofi Annan]] said that [[small arms]] could be described as WMD because the fatalities they cause "''dwarf that of all other weapons systems – and in most years greatly exceed the toll of the atomic bombs that devastated [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]''". <ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070902003808/http://disarmament.un.org/cab/smallarms/statements/colombiaE.html Colombia]</ref> . 

An additional condition often implicitly applied to WMD is that the use of the weapons must be strategic. In other words, they would be designed to "''have consequences far outweighing the size and effectiveness of the weapons themselves''". <ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,7813-991589,00.html What makes a weapon one of mass destruction? – Times Online]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> The strategic nature of WMD also defines their function in the military doctrine of [[total war]] as targeting the means a country would use to support and supply its war effort, specifically its population, industry, and natural resources.  . 

Within U.S. [[civil defense]] organizations, the category is now '''Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive (CBRNE)''', which defines WMD as:
:''(1) Any [[explosive]], [[Incendiary device|incendiary]], [[poison gas]], [[bomb]], [[grenade]], or [[rocket]] having a [[propellant]] charge of more than four ounces [113 g], [[missile]] having an explosive or incendiary charge of more than one-quarter ounce [7 g], or [[land mine|mine]] or device similar to the above. (2) Poison gas. (3) Any weapon involving a disease organism. (4) Any weapon that is designed to release [[radioactive contamination|radiation]] at a level dangerous to human life.''{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} .

[[Image:US nuclear warheads 1945-2002 graph.png|thumb|[[Nuclear weapons and the United States|U.S. nuclear warheads]], 1945–2002]]
{{Main|List of countries with nuclear weapons}}
The only country to have used a nuclear weapon in war is the [[The United States and weapons of mass destruction|United States]], which [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped two atomic bombs]] on the Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] during World War II. There are eight countries that have declared they possess nuclear weapons and are known to have tested a nuclear weapon, only five of which are members of the NPT. The eight are [[People's Republic of China and weapons of mass destruction|China]], [[France and weapons of mass destruction|France]], [[India and weapons of mass destruction|India]], [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|North Korea]], [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|Pakistan]], [[Russia and weapons of mass destruction|Russia]], the [[The United Kingdom and weapons of mass destruction|United Kingdom]], and the [[Nuclear weapons and the United States|United States]].  . 

[[Israel and weapons of mass destruction|Israel]] is considered by most analysts to have nuclear weapons numbering in the low hundreds as well, but maintains an official policy of nuclear ambiguity, neither denying nor confirming its nuclear status.  . 

[[Iran and weapons of mass destruction|Iran]] is suspected by western countries of seeking nuclear weapons, a claim that it denies. While the truth is unknown, the November 2007 NIE on Iran stated that Iran halted its nuclear weapons program in the fall of 2003. <ref>http://www.dni.gov/press_releases/20071203_release.pdf</ref> . 

[[South Africa and weapons of mass destruction|South Africa]] developed a small nuclear arsenal in the 1980s but disassembled them in the early 1990s, making it the only country to have fully given up an independently developed nuclear weapons arsenal. [[Belarus]], Kazakhstan, and [[Ukraine]] inherited stockpiles of nuclear arms following the break-up of the [[Soviet Union]], but relinquished them to the Russian Federation.  . 

Countries with access to nuclear weapons through [[nuclear sharing]] agreements include Belgium, [[Germany and weapons of mass destruction|Germany]], Italy, the [[Netherlands and weapons of mass destruction|Netherlands]], and [[Turkey]]. [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|North Korea]] has claimed to have developed and tested nuclear devices. Although outside sources have been unable to unequivocally support the state's claims, North Korea has officially been identified to have nuclear weapons.  . 

==United States politics==. 
Due to the indiscriminate impact of WMDs, the fear of a WMD attack has shaped political policies and campaigns, fostered social movements, and has been the central theme of many films. Support for different levels of WMD development and control varies nationally and internationally. Yet understanding of the nature of the threats is not high, in part because of imprecise usage of the term by politicians and the media.  . 

Fear of WMD, or of threats diminished by the possession of WMD, has long been used to catalyze public support for various WMD policies. They include mobilization of pro- and anti-WMD campaigners alike, and generation of popular political support. The term WMD may be used as a powerful [[buzzword]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thornwalker.com/ditch/dtw_wmd.htm |title=David T.

A television commercial called ''[[Daisy (television commercial)|Daisy]]'', promoting Democrat [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s 1964 [[U.S. presidential election, 1964|presidential candidacy]], invoked the fear of a nuclear war and was an element in Johnson's subsequent election.  . 

More recently, the threat of potential WMD in Iraq was used by President George W. Bush to generate public support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Weapons_of_mass_deception |title=Weapons of mass deception – SourceWatch |publisher=Sourcewatch.org |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theava.com/03/08-13-warpimps.html |title=War Pimps, by Jeffrey St. Clair [Weapons of Mass Deception: The Uses of Propaganda in President Bush's War on Iraq, by John Stauber and Sheldon Rampton&#93; |publisher=Theava.com |date=13 August 2003 |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> Broad reference to Iraqi WMD in general was seen as an element of President Bush's arguments. <ref name="autogenerated1" /> . 

As Paul Wolfowitz explained: "For bureaucratic reasons, we settled on one issue, weapons of mass destruction, because it was the one reason everyone could agree on."<ref name=USAToday>Qtd. in [[Associated Press]], [http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2003-05-30-wolfowitz-iraq_x.htm "Wolfowitz Comments Revive Doubts Over Iraq's WMD"], ''[[USA Today]]'', 30 May 2003, accessed 8 May 2007. </ref> To date, however, [[Multinational force in Iraq|Coalition forces]] have found mainly degraded artillery shells.  . 

There was almost no dissent on the issue. Molly Ivins wrote: "The ONLY (source) to report skeptically on the administration's claims about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction before the war? Knight-Ridder and its terrific reporters Warren Strobel and Jonathan Landay."<ref name=MollyIvins>[http://www.freepress.org/columns/display/1/2006/1338 "Newspaper Suicide"], ''[[Free Press (organization)|The Free Press]]'', 23 March 2006. Retrieved 21 November 2010. </ref> . 

On 21 June 2006, then-United States Republican Senator [[Rick Santorum]] claimed "We have found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, chemical weapons." According to the Washington Post, he was referring to 500 such shells "that had been buried near the Iranian border, and then long forgotten, by Iraqi troops during their eight-year war with Iran, which ended in 1988." That night, "intelligence officials reaffirmed that the shells were old and were not the suspected weapons of mass destruction sought in Iraq after the 2003 invasion of Iraq." The shells had been uncovered and reported on in 2004. <ref>{{cite news|author=Post Store |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/21/AR2006062101837.html |title=Lawmakers Cite Weapons Found in Iraq – |work=The Washington Post |date= 22 June 2006|accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> . 

In 2004, Polish troops found nineteen 1980s-era rocket warheads, thwarting an attempt by militants to buy them at $5000 each. Some of the rockets contained extremely deteriorated nerve agent. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3861197.stm|title=Troops 'foil Iraq nerve gas bid'|date=2 July 2004|publisher=BBC|accessdate=7 December 2007}}</ref> . 

==Media coverage of WMD==. 
In 2004, the Center for International and Security Studies at Maryland (CISSM) released a report<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20041022050812/http://www.cissm.umd.edu/documents/WMDstudy_full.pdf] by Prof. Susan Moeller</ref> examining the media’s coverage of WMD issues during three separate periods: [[Nuclear testing|nuclear weapons tests]] by India and Pakistan in May 1998; the US announcement of evidence of a [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|North Korean nuclear weapons program]] in October 2002; and revelations about [[Iran's nuclear program]] in May 2003. The CISSM report notes that poor coverage resulted less from political [[Media bias|bias among the media]] than from tired journalistic conventions. The report’s major findings were that:
# ''Most media outlets represented WMD as a monolithic menace, failing to adequately distinguish between weapons programs and actual weapons or to address the real differences among chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological weapons. 
# ''Most journalists accepted the [[Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration|Bush administration’s]] formulation of the “[[War on Terrorism|War on Terror]]” as a campaign against WMD, in contrast to coverage during the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] era, when many journalists made careful distinctions between acts of terrorism and the acquisition and use of WMD. 
# ''Many stories stenographically reported the incumbent administration’s perspective on WMD, giving too little critical examination of the way officials framed the events, issues, threats, and policy options. 
# ''Too few stories proffered alternative perspectives to official line, a problem exacerbated by the [[journalism|journalistic]] prioritizing of breaking-news stories and the “[[inverted pyramid]]” style of storytelling.  . 

In a separate study published in 2005,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/journal.asp?ref=0956-7976 |title=Psychological Science – Journal Information |publisher=Blackwellpublishing.com |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> a group of researchers assessed the effects reports and retractions in the media had on people’s [[memory]] regarding the [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|search for WMD in Iraq]] during the 2003 Iraq War. The study focused on populations in two [[Coalition of the willing|coalition]] countries (Australia and USA) and one opposed to the war (Germany). Results showed that US citizens generally did not correct initial misconceptions regarding WMD, even following disconfirmation; Australian and German citizens were more responsive to retractions. Dependence on the initial source of information led to a substantial minority of Americans exhibiting [[false memories|false memory]] that WMD were indeed discovered, while they were not. This led to three conclusions:
# ''The repetition of tentative news stories, even if they are subsequently disconfirmed, can assist in the creation of false memories in a substantial proportion of people. 
# ''Once information is published, its subsequent correction does not alter people's beliefs unless they are suspicious about the motives underlying the events the news stories are about. 
# ''When people ignore corrections, they do so irrespective of how certain they are that the corrections occurred.  . 

A poll conducted between June and September 2003 asked people whether they thought evidence of WMD had been discovered in Iraq since the war ended. They were also asked which media sources they relied upon. Those who obtained their news primarily from Fox News were three times as likely to believe that evidence of WMD had been discovered in Iraq than those who relied on PBS and NPR for their news, and one third more likely than those who primarily watched CBS.  .

In 2006 Fox News reported the claims of two Republican lawmakers that WMDs had been found in Iraq,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,200499,00.html|title=
Report: Hundreds of WMDs Found in Iraq|publisher=Fox News|date=22 June 2006}}</ref> based upon unclassified portions of a report by the [[National Ground Intelligence Center]]. Quoting from the report Senator [[Rick Santorum]] said "Since 2003, coalition forces have recovered approximately 500 weapons munitions which contain degraded mustard or sarin nerve agent". According to David Kay, who appeared before the US House Armed Services Committee to discuss these badly corroded munitions, they were leftovers, many years old, improperly stored or destroyed by the Iraqis. <ref>Kay, David. "House Armed Services Committee Hearing", 29 June 2006</ref> Charles Duelfer agreed, stating on NPR's ''Talk of the Nation'': "When I was running the ISG – the Iraq Survey Group – we had a couple of them that had been turned in to these IEDs, the improvised explosive devices. But they are local hazards. They are not a major, you know, weapon of mass destruction."<ref>Duelfer, Charles. [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5504298 Expert: Iraq WMD Find Did Not Point to Ongoing Program] NPR. 22 June 2006</ref> . 

Later, wikileaks would show that these kind of WMDs continued to be found as the Iraqi occupation continued<ref>Noah Shachtman.[http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/10/wikileaks-show-wmd-hunt-continued-in-iraq-with-surprising-results/ WikiLeaks Show WMD Hunt Continued in Iraq – With Surprising Results] Wired. 23 October 2010</ref> . 

Many news agencies, including Fox News, reported the conclusions of the [[CIA]] that, based upon the investigation of the [[Iraq Survey Group]], WMDs have yet to be found in Iraq. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7634313/ |title=CIA's Final Report: No WMD Found in Iraq|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=25 April 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,154574,00.html|title=Iraq WMD Inspectors End Search, Find Nothing|publisher=Fox News|date=26 April 2005}}</ref> . 

==Public perceptions of WMD==. 
Awareness and opinions of WMD have varied during the course of their history. Their threat is a source of unease, security, and pride to different people. The anti-WMD movement is embodied most in [[nuclear disarmament]], and led to the formation of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]].  . 

In order to increase awareness of all kinds of WMD, in 2004 the nuclear physicist and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Joseph Rotblat]] inspired the creation of [http://www.wmdawareness.org.uk/ The WMD Awareness Programme] to provide trustworthy and up to date information on WMD world wide.  . 

In 1998 [[University of New Mexico]]'s [[Institute for Public Policy]] released their third report<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/usa/1998/980803-nuclear.htm |title=Sandia National Laboratories – News Releases |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> on US perceptions – including the general public, politicians and scientists – of nuclear weapons since the breakup of the [[Soviet Union]]. Risks of nuclear conflict, proliferation, and terrorism were seen as substantial.  . 

While maintenance of a nuclear US arsenal was considered above average in importance, there was widespread support for a reduction in the stockpile, and very little support for developing and testing new nuclear weapons.  . 

Also in 1998, but after the UNM survey was conducted, nuclear weapons became an issue in India's election of March,<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/india/chron.htm |title=17 Days in May – India Nuclear Forces |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> in relation to political tensions with neighboring [[Pakistan]]. Prior to the election the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) announced it would “declare India a nuclear weapon state” after coming to power.  . 

BJP won the elections, and on 14 May, three days after India tested nuclear weapons for the second time, a public opinion poll reported that a majority of Indians favored the country’s nuclear build-up.  . 

On 15 April 2004, the [[Program on International Policy Attitudes]] (PIPA) reported<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20050929024408/http://www.pipa.org/OnlineReports/WMD/WMDreport_04_15_04.pdf The Pipa/Knowledge Networks Polll<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> that US citizens showed high levels of concern regarding WMD, and that preventing the [[Nuclear proliferation|spread of nuclear weapons]] should be "a very important US foreign policy goal", accomplished through multilateral arms control rather than the use of military threats.  . 

A majority also believed the US should be more forthcoming with its biological research and its [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] commitment of nuclear arms reduction, and incorrectly thought the US was a party to various non-proliferation treaties.  . 

A Russian opinion poll conducted on 5 August 2005 indicated half the population believes new nuclear powers have the right to possess nuclear weapons. <ref>{{cite web|author=Russian public opinion on nuclear weapons |url=http://russianforces.org/eng/blog/archive/000580.shtml |title=Russian public opinion on nuclear weapons – Blog – Russian strategic nuclear forces |publisher=Russianforces.org |date=5 August 2005 |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> 39% believes the Russian stockpile should be reduced, though not fully eliminated.  . 

==WMD in popular culture==. 
Weapons of mass destruction and their related impacts have been a mainstay of [[popular culture]] since the beginning of the [[Cold War]], as both political commentary and humorous outlet.  .

===Radioactive weaponry/hazard symbol=== . 

[[Image:Radiation warning symbol.svg|left|65px|Radioactivity]] . 

The international radioactivity symbol (also known as [[trefoil]]) first appeared in 1946, at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] Radiation Laboratory. At the time, it was rendered as [[magenta]], and was set on a blue background. <ref name="Origin of the Radiation Warning Symbol (Trefoil)">{{cite web|url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/articlesstories/radwarnsymbstory.htm|title=Origin of the Radiation Warning Symbol (Trefoil)}}</ref> . 

It is drawn with a central circle of radius ''R'', the blades having an internal radius of 1.5''R'' and an external radius of 5''R'', and separated from each other by 60°. <ref name="Biohazard and radioactive Symbol, design and proportions">{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/CIS_WSH_part476_54539_7.pdf|title=Biohazard and radioactive Symbol, design and proportions}}
</ref> It is meant to represent a radiating atom.  . 

The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] found, however, that the symbol is unintuitive and can be variously interpreted by those uneducated in its meaning, and that its role as a hazard warning was compromised as it did not clearly indicate "danger" to many non-Westerners and children who encountered it. As a result of research, a new radiation hazard symbol was developed to be placed near the most dangerous parts of radiation sources featuring a skull, someone running away, and using the color red rather than yellow as the background. <ref>Linda Lodding, "[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull482/pdfs/18RadSymbol.pdf Drop it and Run! New Symbol Warns of Radiation Dangers and Aims to Save Lives]," ''IAEA Bulletin'' 482 (March 2007): 70–72. </ref> .
