[[Image:US nuclear weapons yield-to-weight comparison.svg|right|thumb|350px|Logarithmic scatterplot comparing the yield (in kilotons) and weight (in kilograms) of all nuclear weapons developed by the United States.]]
The explosive '''yield of a nuclear weapon''' is the amount of [[energy]]  discharged when a [[nuclear weapon]] is detonated, expressed usually in the equivalent [[mass]] of [[trinitrotoluene]] (TNT), either in [[kiloton]]s (thousands of tons of TNT) or [[TNT equivalent|megatons]] (millions of tons of TNT), but sometimes also in [[terajoule]]s (1 kiloton of TNT = 4.184 TJ). Because the precise amount of energy released by TNT is and was subject to measurement uncertainties, especially at the dawn of the nuclear age, the accepted convention is that one kt of TNT is simply defined to be 10<sup>12</sup> [[calorie]]s equivalent, this being very roughly equal to the energy yield of 1,000 tons of TNT.  . 

The yield-to-weight ratio is the amount of weapon yield compared to the mass of the weapon. The theoretical maximum yield-to-weight ratio for fusion weapons (thermonuclear weapons) is 6 megatons of TNT per metric ton of bomb mass (25&nbsp;TJ/kg). Yields of 5.2 megatons/ton and higher have been reported for large weapons constructed for single-warhead use in the early 1960s. <ref>[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons/B41.html The B-41 Bomb]</ref> Since this time, the smaller warheads needed to achieve the increased net damage efficiency (bomb damage/bomb weight) of multiple warhead systems, has resulted in decreases in the yield/weight ratio for single modern warheads.  .

[[Image:Comparative nuclear fireball sizes.svg|right|thumb|250px|Comparative fireball radii for a selection of nuclear weapons. Note that full blast effects would extend many times beyond the fireball itself.]]
As a comparison, the blast yield of the [[GBU-43 Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb]] is 0.011 kt, and that of the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], using a truck-based fertilizer bomb, was  0.002 kt. Most [[List of the largest artificial non-nuclear explosions|artificial non-nuclear explosions]] are considerably smaller than even what are considered to be very small nuclear weapons.  . 

===Yield limits===. 
The yield-to-weight ratio is the amount of weapon yield compared to the mass of the weapon. The theoretical maximum yield-to-weight ratio for fusion weapons is 6 megatons of TNT per metric ton (25&nbsp;TJ/kg). <ref>[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons/B41.html The B-41 Bomb<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The practical achievable limit is somewhat lower, and tends to be lower for smaller, lighter weapons, of the sort that are emphasized in today's arsenals, designed for efficient MIRV use, or delivery by cruise missile systems.  . 

*The 25 Mt yield option reported for the [[B41 nuclear bomb|B41]] would give it a yield-to-weight ratio of 5.2 megatons of TNT per metric ton. While this would require a far greater efficiency than any other current U.S. weapon (at least 40% efficiency in a fusion fuel of lithium deuteride), this was apparently attainable, probably by the use of higher than normal [[isotopes of lithium|Lithium-6]] enrichment in the [[lithium deuteride]] fusion fuel. This results in the [[B41 nuclear bomb|B41]] still retaining '''the record for the highest [[Energy Density|Yield-to-weight]] weapon''' ever made.  . 

*In 1963 DOE declassified statements that the U.S. had the technological capability of deploying a 35 MT warhead on the Titan II, or a 50-60 MT gravity bomb on B-52s. Neither weapon was pursued, but either would require yield-to-weight ratios superior to a 25 MT Mk-41. This may have been achievable by utilizing the same design as the [[B41 nuclear bomb|B-41]] but with the addition of a [[U-235|HEU]] tamper, in place of the cheaper, but lower [[energy density]] [[Uranium-238|U-238]] tamper which is the most commonly used tamper material in [[Teller-Ulam]] thermonuclear weapons.  . 

*For current smaller US weapons, yield is 600 to 2200 kilotons of TNT per metric ton. By comparison, for the very small tactical devices such as the Davy Crockett it was 0.4 to 40 kilotons of TNT per metric ton. For historical comparison, for Little Boy the yield was only 4 kilotons of TNT per metric ton, and for the largest [[Tsar Bomba]], the yield was 2 megatons of TNT per metric ton (deliberately reduced from about twice as much yield for the same weapon, so there is little doubt that this bomb as designed was capable of 4 megatons per ton yield).  . 

*The largest '''pure-fission''' bomb ever constructed had a 500 kiloton yield, which is probably in the range of the upper limit on such designs. Fusion boosting could likely raise the efficiency of such a weapon significantly, but eventually all fission-based weapons have an upper yield limit due to the difficulties of dealing with large critical masses. However there is no known upper yield limit for a fusion bomb.  . 

*Because the maximum theoretical yield-to-weight ratio is about 6 megatons of TNT per metric ton, and the maximum achieved ratio was apparently 5.2 megatons of TNT per metric ton, there is a practical limit on the '''total yield''' for air-delivered weapon. Note that most later generation weapons have eliminated the very heavy casing once thought needed for the nuclear reactions to occur efficiently - this greatly increases the achievable yield-to-weight ratio. For example, the Mk-36 bomb as built had a yield-to-weight ratio of 1.25 megatons of TNT per metric ton. If the 12,000 pound casing of the Mk-36 was reduced by 2/3s, the yield-to-weight ratio would have been 2.3 megatons of TNT per metric ton, which is about the same as the later generation, much lighter 9 megaton Mk/B-53 bomb.  . 

*Delivery '''size limits''' can be estimated to ascertain limits to delivery of extremely high yield weapons. If the full 250 metric ton payload of the [[Antonov An-225]] could be used, a 1.3 gigaton bomb could be delivered. Likewise the maximum limit of a missile-delivered weapon is determined by the missile payload capacity. The large Russian [[R-36 (missile)|SS-18]] ICBM has a payload capacity of 7,200 kg, so the calculated maximum delivered yield would be 37.4 megatons of TNT. A [[Saturn V]]-scale missile could deliver over 120 tons with a yield of about 700 megatons.  . 

Again, it is helpful for understanding to emphasize that large single warheads are seldom a part of today's arsenals, since smaller [[MIRV]] warheads are far more destructive for a given total yield or payload capacity. This effect, which results from the fact that destructive power of a single warhead scales approximately as the 2/3 power of its yield, more than makes up for the lessened yield/weight efficiency encountered if ballistic missile warheads are scaled-down from the maximal size that could be carried by a single-warhead missile.  .

==Calculating yields and controversy==. 
Yields of [[nuclear explosion]]s can be very hard to calculate, even using numbers as rough as in the kiloton or megaton range (much less down to the resolution of individual [[terajoule]]s). Even under very controlled conditions, precise yields can be very hard to determine, and for less controlled conditions the margins of error can be quite large. Yields can be calculated in a number of ways, including calculations based on blast size, blast brightness, seismographic data, and the strength of the shock wave. [[Enrico Fermi]] famously made a (very) rough calculation of the yield of the [[Trinity test]] by dropping small pieces of paper in the air and measuring at how far they were moved by the shock wave of the explosion.  . 

[[Image:Trinity_Test_Fireball_25ms.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Picture of the blast used by G.I. Taylor to estimate the yield of the device detonated during the [[Trinity test]]]] . 

A good approximation of the yield of the Trinity test device was obtained in 1950 from simple [[dimensional analysis]] as well as an estimation of the heat capacity for very hot air, by the British physicist [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor|G. I. Taylor]]. Taylor had initially done this highly classified work in mid-1941, and published a paper which included an analysis of the Trinity data fireball when the Trinity photograph data was declassified in 1950 (after the USSR had exploded its own version of this bomb).  . 

Taylor noted that the [[radius]] ''R'' of the blast should initially depend only on the energy ''E'' of the explosion, the time ''t'' after the detonation, and the density ρ of the air.  The only number having dimensions of length that can be constructed from these quantities is: . 

<math>R=S\left( {\frac{{E{t}}^{2}}{\rho}} \right)^{\frac {1} {5}}</math> . 

Here S is a dimensionless constant having a value approximately equal to 1, since it is low order function of the [[heat capacity ratio]] or adiabatic index (γ = C<sub>p</sub>/
C<sub>v</sub>), which is approximately 1 for all conditions.  . 

Using the picture of the Trinity test shown here (which had been publicly released by the U.S. government and published in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine), using successive frames or the explosion, Taylor found that R<sup>5</sup>/t<sup>2</sup> is a constant in a given nuclear blast (especially between 0.38 ms after the shock wave has formed, and 1.93 ms before significant energy is lost by thermal radiation). Furthermore, he estimated a value for S numerically at 1.  . 

Thus, with ''t'' = 0.025 s and the blast radius was 140 metres, and taking ''ρ'' to be 1 kg/m³ (the measured value at Trinity on the day of the test, as opposed to sea level values of approximately 1.3 kg/m³) and solving for ''E'', Taylor obtained that the yield was about 22 kilotons of TNT (90&nbsp;TJ). This does not take into account the fact that the energy should only be about half this value for a hemispherical blast, but this very simple argument did agree to within 10% with the official value of the bomb's yield in 1950, which was {{convert|20|ktonTNT}} (See G. I. Taylor, ''Proc. Roy. Soc. London A'' '''200''', pp. 235-247 (1950).)  . 

A good approximation to Taylor's constant S for γ below about 2 is: S = [75(γ-1)/8π]<sup>1/5</sup>. 
<ref> http://glasstone.blogspot.com/2006/03/analytical-mathematics-for-physical.html. </ref>. The value of the [[heat capacity ratio]] here is between the 1.67 of fully dissociated air molecules and the lower value for very hot diatomic air (1.2), and under conditions of an atomic fireball is (coincidentally) close to the S.T.P. (standard) gamma for room temperature air, which is 1.4. This gives the value of Taylor's '''S''' constant to be 1.036 for the adiabatic hypershock region where the constant R<sup>5</sup>/t<sup>2</sup> condition holds.  . 

===Other methods and controversy===. 
Where this data is not available, as in a number of cases, precise yields have been in dispute, especially when they are tied to questions of politics. The weapons used in the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], for example, were highly individual and very idiosyncratic designs, and gauging their yield retrospectively has been quite difficult. The Hiroshima bomb, "[[Little Boy]]", is estimated to have been between {{convert|12|and|18|ktTNT}} (a 20% margin of error), while the Nagasaki bomb, "[[Fat Man]]", is estimated to be between {{convert|18|and|23|ktTNT}} (a 10% margin of error). Such apparently small changes in values can be important when trying to use the data from these bombings as reflective of how other bombs would behave in combat, and also result in differing assessments of how many "Hiroshima bombs" other weapons are equivalent to (for example, the [[Ivy Mike]] hydrogen bomb was equivalent to either 867 or 578 Hiroshima weapons &mdash; a rhetorically quite substantial difference &mdash; depending on whether one uses the high or low figure for the calculation). Other disputed yields have included the massive [[Tsar Bomba]], whose yield was claimed between being "only" {{convert|50|MtTNT}} or at a maximum of {{convert|57|MtTNT}} by differing political figures, either as a way for hyping the power of the bomb or as an attempt to undercut it.  .
