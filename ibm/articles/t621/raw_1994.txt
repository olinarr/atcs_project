{{Weapons of mass destruction}}
Russia possesses  the largest stockpiles of '''[[weapons of mass destruction]]''' in the world. <ref>{{cite web |title=Status of World Nuclear Forces |url=http://www.fas.org/programs/ssp/nukes/nuclearweapons/nukestatus.html |date=July 16, 2009 |work= |publisher=Federation of American Scientists |accessdate=23 July 2009}}</ref>  The country declared an arsenal of 39,967 tons of [[chemical weapon]]s in 1997,<ref name=NTIchem/> of which 48% have been destroyed. <ref name=sixty/> The [[Federation of American Scientists]], a renowned organization for assessing nuclear weapon stockpiles, claims that Russia has 4,650 active nuclear warheads, while the U.S. has 2,468. <ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.fas.org/programs/ssp/nukes/nuclearweapons/nukestatus.html Federation of American Scientists :: Status of World Nuclear Forces<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Other sources however say that the U.S. has more nuclear warheads and the actual numbers remain a subject of estimations and ongoing constant discussion depending on their respective source. Alexander Khramchikhin, an analyst at the Institute of Political and Military Analysis, for instance said Russia has 3,100 nuclear warheads while the U.S. has some 5,700. <ref>[http://en.rian.ru/papers/20090514/155022873.html What the Russian papers say | What Russian papers say | RIA Novosti<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The [[Soviet Union]] ratified the [[Geneva Protocol]] on January 22, 1975 with reservations. The reservations were later dropped on January 18, 2001.

===Nuclear arsenal of Russia===. 
Mid-2007 Russia was estimated to have around 3,281 active [[Strategic nuclear weapon|strategic nuclear warheads]] in its arsenal. <ref name="Bloomfield">[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/06/04/wputin204.xml Russia's nuclear capabilities] by Adrian Blomfield, [[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]], 5 June 2007</ref> Russia also has a large but unknown number of [[tactical nuclear weapons]]. <ref>[http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/Russia/index.html Russia profile] [[Nuclear Threat Initiative]]</ref> Strategic nuclear forces of Russia include:<ref name="Bloomfield"/>
#Land based Strategic Rocket Forces: 489 missiles carrying up to 1,788 warheads; they employ immobile (silos), like [[R-36 (missile)|SS-18]] Satan, and mobile delivery systems, like [[RT-2UTTH Topol M|SS-27]] Topol M. 
#Sea based Strategic Fleet: 12 submarines carrying up to 609 warheads; they should be able to employ, in a near future, delivery systems like [[Bulava (missile)|SS-N-30 Bulava.]]
#Strategic Aviation: 79 bombers carrying up to 884 [[cruise missile]]s.  . 

As of July 2009, Russia's strategic arsenal reportedly shrunk to 2,723 warheads, including: 367 [[ICBM]]s with 1,248 warheads, 13 [[SSBN]]s with 591 warheads and 76 bombers with 884 warheads. <ref>[http://www.russianforces.org/current/ Russian strategic nuclear forces (November 2009)]</ref> . 

===Doctrine of limited nuclear war===. 
According to a Russian military doctrine stated in 2003, tactical nuclear weapons of the Strategic Deterrence Forces could be used to "prevent political pressure against Russia and her allies ([[Armenia]], [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Tajikistan]])." Thus, the Russian leadership "is officially contemplating a limited [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]". <ref name="trenin">[http://ifri.org/files/Securite_defense/prolif_paper_Trenin.pdf Russia's Nuclear Policy in the 21st Century Environment] - analysis by Dmitri Trenin, IFRI Proliferation Papers n°13, 2005</ref> . 

===Nuclear proliferation===. 
After the [[Korean War]], the [[Soviet Union]] transferred nuclear technology and weapons to the [[People's Republic of China]] as an adversary of the [[United States]] and [[NATO]]. According to [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]], "Khrushchev’s nuclear-proliferation process started with Communist China in April 1955, when the new ruler in the Kremlin consented to supply Beijing a sample atomic bomb and to help with its mass production. Subsequently, the Soviet Union built all the essentials of China’s new military nuclear industry."<ref name="bomb">[http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YmU3NjM4ZTg3NjViMTUyNWJmYWYzMDE4ZmRhOTQxZmI= Tyrants and the Bomb] - by [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]], ''[[National Review]]'', October 17, 2006</ref> . 

Russia is one of the five "Nuclear Weapons States" (NWS) under the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT), which Russia ratified (as the [[Soviet Union]]) in 1968.  . 

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, a number of Soviet-era nuclear warheads remained on the territories of Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. Under the terms of the Lisbon Protocol to the NPT, and following the 1995 Trilateral Agreement between Russia, Belarus, and the USA, these were transferred to Russia, leaving Russia as the sole inheritor of the Soviet nuclear arsenal. It is estimated that the USSR had approximately 30,000 nuclear weapons stockpiled at the time of its collapse.  . 

The collapse of the Soviet Union allowed for a warming of relations with NATO. Fears of a [[nuclear holocaust]] lessened. In September 1997, the former secretary of the Russian Security Council Alexander Lebed claimed 100 "suitcase sized" nuclear weapons were unaccounted for. He said he was attempting to inventory the weapons when he was fired by President Boris Yeltsin in October 1996. <ref>[http://www.armscontrol.org/act/1997_09/lebedsept Russian Officials Deny Claims Of Missing Nuclear Weapons]</ref> In 2005, Sergey Sinchenko, a legislator from the [[Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc]], said 250 nuclear weapons were unaccounted for. When comparing documents of nuclear weapons transferred from Ukraine to weapons received by Russia, there was a 250-weapon discrepancy. <ref>[http://www.wmdinsights.com/I5/R4_RussiaAndUkranian.htm Russian and Ukrainian Officials Deny New Allegations That Nuclear Warheads Were Lost in the 1990s]</ref> Indeed, several US politicians have expressed worries and promised legislation addressing the threat. <ref>[http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/1010/nuclear_dangers.html?breadcrumb=%2F Nuclear Dangers: Fear Increases of Terrorists Getting Hands on 'Loose' Warheads as Security Slips]</ref> . 

In 2002, the United States and Russia agreed to reduce their stockpiles to not more than 2,200 warheads each in the [[SORT]] treaty. In 2003, the US rejected Russian proposals to further reduce each nation's nuclear stockpiles to 1,500. Russia, in turn, refused to discuss reduction of [[tactical nuclear weapons]]. <ref name="trenin"/> . 

Russia is actively producing and developing new nuclear weapons. Since 1997 it manufactures [[Topol-M]] (SS-27) ICBMs.  . 

There were allegations that Russia contributed to [[North Korean nuclear program]], selling it the equipment for the safe storage and transportation of nuclear materials. <ref name ="Korea">[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/07/09/wkorea09.xml&sSheet=/news/2006/07/09/ixnews.html Russia secretly offered North Korea nuclear technology] - by a Special Correspondent in Pyongyang and Michael Hirst, ''Telegraph'', September 7, 2006. </ref> Nevertheless, Russia condemned Korean nuclear tests since then. <ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-05/28/content_11446860.htm Russia expresses serious concern over DPRK nuke issue]</ref> . 

According to high-ranking Russian [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|SVR]] defector [[Sergei Tretyakov (intelligence officer)|Sergei Tretyakov]], a businessman told him that he keeps his own nuclear bomb at his [[dacha]] outside [[Moscow]]. <ref name="Comrade J">Pete Earley, "Comrade J: The Untold Secrets of Russia's Master Spy in America After the End of the Cold War", Penguin Books, 2007, ISBN 978-0-399-15439-3, pages 114-121. </ref> . 

===Nuclear sabotage allegations from Russia===. 
The highest-ranking [[GRU]] defector [[Stanislav Lunev]] described alleged Soviet plans for using [[tactical nuclear weapons]] for [[sabotage]] against the United States in the event of war. He described Soviet-made [[suitcase nukes]] identified as RA-115s (or RA-115-01s for submersible weapons) which weigh from fifty to sixty pounds. These portable bombs can last for many years if wired to an electric source. “In case there is a loss of power, there is a battery backup. If the battery runs low, the weapon has a transmitter that sends a coded message – either by satellite or directly to a [[GRU]] post at a Russian embassy or consulate.”. <ref name="Lunev">[[Stanislav Lunev]]. ''Through the Eyes of the Enemy: The Autobiography of Stanislav Lunev'', Regnery Publishing, Inc., 1998. ISBN 0-89526-390-4. </ref> . 

Lunev was personally looking for hiding places for weapons caches in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] area. <ref name="Lunev"/> He said that "it is surprisingly easy to smuggle nuclear weapons into the US" either across the Mexican border or using a small transport missile that can slip though undetected when launched from a Russian airplane. <ref name="Lunev"/> US Congressman [[Curt Weldon]] supported claims by Lunev, but "Weldon said later the FBI discredited Lunev, saying that he exaggerated things." <ref>Nicholas Horrock, [http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Top_News/2001/12/20/fbi_focusing_on_portable_nuke_threat/9007/ "FBI focusing on portable nuke threat"], ''UPI'' (20 December 2001). </ref> Searches of the areas identified by Lunev – who admits he never planted any weapons in the US – have been conducted, "but law-enforcement officials have never found such weapons caches, with or without portable nuclear weapons." in the US. <ref>Steve Goldstein and Chris Mondics, "Some Weldon-backed allegations unconfirmed; Among them: A plot to crash planes into a reactor, and missing suitcase-size Soviet atomic weapons." ''Philadelphia Inquirer'' (15 March 2006) A7. </ref> . 

==Biological weapons==. 
{{main|Soviet program of biological weapons}} . 

Soviet program of [[biological weapon]]s was initially developed by the
[[Ministry of Defense of the USSR]] (between 1945 and 1973). <ref name="Alibek">Alibek, K. and S. Handelman. Biohazard: The Chilling True Story of the Largest Covert Biological Weapons Program in the World– Told from Inside by the Man Who Ran it. Delta (2000) ISBN 0-385-33496-6</ref> . 

The USSR signed the [[Biological Weapons Convention]] on April 10, 1972 and ratified the treaty on March 26, 1975. Since then, the program of Biological weapons was run primarily by the "civilian" [[Biopreparat]] agency, although it also included numerous facilities run by the  Soviet Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Chemical Industry, Ministry of Health, and [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]]. <ref name="Alibek"/> . 

According to [[Ken Alibek]], who was deputy-director of [[Biopreparat]], the Soviet biological weapons agency, and who defected to the USA in 1992, weapons were developed in labs in isolated areas of the Soviet Union including mobilization facilities at [[Omutininsk]], [[Penza]] and [[Pokrov]] and research facilities at [[Moscow]], [[Stirzhi]] and [[Vladimir]]. These weapons were tested at several facilities most often at "Rebirth Island" ([[Vozrozhdeniya]]) in the [[Aral Sea]] by firing the weapons into the air above monkeys tied to posts, the monkeys would then be monitored to determine the effects. According to Alibek, although Soviet offensive program was officially ended in 1992, Russia may be still involved in the activities prohibited by BWC. <ref name="Alibek"/> . 

In 1993, the story about the [[Sverdlovsk anthrax leak]] was published in Russia. The incident occurred when [[spore]]s of [[anthrax]] were accidentally released from a military facility in the city of Sverdlovsk (formerly, and now again, [[Yekaterinburg]]) 900 miles east of Moscow on April 2, 1979. The ensuing outbreak of the disease resulted in 94 people becoming infected, 64 of whom died over a period of six weeks. <ref name="Alibek"/> . 

==Chemical weapons==. 
Russia signed the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] on January 13, 1993, and ratified it on November 5, 1997. Russia declared an arsenal of 39,967 tons of [[Chemical warfare|chemical weapons]] in 1997 consisting of:
* [[blister agent]]s: [[Lewisite]], [[mustard gas|mustard]], Lewisite-mustard-mix (HL)
* [[nerve agent]]s: [[Sarin]], [[Soman]], [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]] . 

Russia met its treaty obligations by destroying 1% of its chemical agents by the Chemical Weapons Convention's 2002 deadline,<ref>[http://www.opcw.org/html/global/ra_frameset.html News<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref> but requested technical and financial assistance and extensions on the deadlines of 2004 and 2007 due to the environmental challenges of chemical disposal. This extension procedure spelled out in the treaty has been utilized by other countries, including the [[United States and weapons of mass destruction#Chemical weapons disposal|United States]]. The extended deadline for complete destruction (April 2012) will not be met. <ref name=sixty>[http://www.opcw.org/nc/news/article/global-campaign-to-destroy-chemical-weapons-passes-60-percent-mark/ Global Campaign to Destroy Chemical Weapons Passes 60 Percent Mark]. [[OPCW]]. 8 July 2010 (Accessed 19 August 2010)</ref> As of July 2010, Russia has destroyed 48% of its stockpile. <ref name=sixty/> . 

Russia  has stored its chemical weapons (or the required chemicals) which it declared within the CWC at 8 locations: in [[Gorny, Saratov Oblast|Gorny]] ([[Saratov Oblast]]) (2.9% of the declared stockpile by mass) and [[Kambarka]] ([[Udmurtia|Udmurt Republic]]) (15.9%) stockpiles already have been destroyed. In [[Shchuchye, Kurgan Oblast|Shchuchye]] ([[Kurgan Oblast]]) (13.6%), [[Maradykovsky]] ([[Kirov Oblast]]) (17.4%) and [[Leonidovka]] ([[Penza Oblast]]) (17.2%) destruction takes place, while installations are under construction in [[Pochep]] ([[Bryansk Oblast]]) (18.8%) and [[Kizner]] ([[Udmurtia|Udmurt Republic]]) (14.2%). <ref name=NTIchem>{{cite web|url=http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/russia/chemical/index.html/|title=Russia profile|publisher=NTI.org|year=2009 |accessdate=2010-09-17}}</ref> . 

===Novichok agents===. 
{{main|Novichok agent}}
In addition to the chemical weapons declared under the convention, Russia is expected to be in possession of a series of nerve agents developed in the 1970s and 1980s, some of which are one order of magnitude more lethal (based on LD50 exposure testing) than [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]] (the agent with the lowest LD50 in the US arsenal). <ref>Tucker, J. B.; War of Nerves; Anchor Books; New York; 2006; pp 232-233. </ref> The agents are termed Novichok (''newcomer'') agents.  .
