There are currently eight [[Sovereign state|states]] that have successfully detonated [[nuclear weapon]]s. [[United Nations Security Council#Permanent members|Five]] are considered to be "'''nuclear-weapon states'''" (NWS) under the terms of the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT). In order of acquisition of nuclear weapons these are: the [[United States]], [[Russia]] (successor state to the [[Soviet Union]]), the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and [[People's Republic of China|China]]. [[Nation]]s that are known or believed to possess nuclear weapons are sometimes referred to as the ''nuclear club''.  . 

Since the NPT entered into force in 1970, three states that were not parties to the Treaty have conducted [[nuclear testing|nuclear tests]], namely [[India]], [[Pakistan]], and [[North Korea]]. North Korea had been a party to the NPT but withdrew in 2003. [[Israel and nuclear weapons|Israel]] is also widely believed to have nuclear weapons, though it has refused to confirm or deny this, and is not known to have conducted a nuclear test. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,,1970616,00.html |title=Calls for Olmert to resign after nuclear gaffe Israel and the Middle East &#124; Guardian Unlimited |publisher=Guardian |date= 2006-12-12|accessdate=2009-05-15 | location=London | first=Luke | last=Harding}}</ref>  . 

[[South Africa]] has the unique status of a nation that developed nuclear weapons but has since disassembled its arsenal before joining the NPT.  . 

==Statistics==. 
{{Weapons of mass destruction}}
The following is a list of [[Sovereign state|states]] that have admitted the possession of nuclear weapons, the approximate number of [[warhead]]s under their control, and the year they tested their first weapon. This list is informally known in global politics as the "Nuclear Club." With the exception of Russia and the United States (which have subjected their nuclear forces to independent verification under various treaties) these figures are estimates, in some cases quite unreliable estimates. Also, these figures represent total warheads possessed, rather than deployed. In particular, under the [[SORT]] treaty thousands of Russian and U.S. nuclear warheads are in inactive stockpiles awaiting processing. The fissile material contained in the warheads can then be recycled for use in [[Nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactors]].  . 

From a high of 65,000 active weapons in 1985, there are now nearly 8,000 active nuclear warheads and more than 22,000 total nuclear warheads in the world in 2010. Many of the decommissioned weapons were simply stored or partially dismantled, not destroyed. <ref>Webster, Paul (July/August 2003). "[http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2009/sep/06/nuclear-weapons-world-us-north-korea-russia-iran]," ''The Guardian''. </ref> As of 2009, the total number was expected to continue to decline by 30%–50% over the next decade.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} .

:The United States developed the first atomic weapons during [[World War&nbsp;II]] in co-operation with the United Kingdom and Canada as part of the [[Manhattan Project]], out of the fear that [[Nazi Germany]] would develop them first. It tested the first nuclear weapon in 1945 ("[[Trinity site|Trinity]]"), and remains the only country to have used nuclear weapons against another nation, during the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. It was the first nation to develop the [[Nuclear weapon design|hydrogen bomb]], testing an experimental version in 1952 ("[[Ivy Mike]]") and a deployable weapon in 1954 ("[[Castle Bravo]]").

:The Soviet Union tested its first nuclear weapon ("[[Joe-1]]") in 1949, in a crash project developed partially with espionage obtained during and after [[World War II]] (see: [[Soviet atomic bomb project]]). The [[USSR]] was the second nation to have developed and tested a [[nuclear weapon]]. The direct motivation for their weapons development was to achieve a balance of power during the [[Cold War]]. It tested its first megaton-range hydrogen bomb ("[[RDS-37]]") in 1955. The Soviet Union also tested the most powerful explosive ever detonated by humans, ("[[Tsar Bomba]]"), with a theoretical yield of 100 megatons, intentionally reduced to 50 when detonated. After its dissolution in 1991, the Soviet weapons entered officially into the possession of the Russian Federation. <ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Holloway|title=Stalin and the bomb: The Soviet Union and atomic energy, 1939-1956|location=New Haven, CT |publisher=Yale University Press|year=1994|isbn=0-300-06056-4}}</ref> At its maximum, the Soviet nuclear arsenal is estimated to have contained some 45,000 warheads (in 1988). <ref name="NorrisKristensenGlobal" /> . 

* '''{{flag|United Kingdom}}'''{{Main|Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|United Kingdom and weapons of mass destruction}}
:The United Kingdom tested its first nuclear weapon ("[[Operation Hurricane|Hurricane]]") in 1952, drawing largely on data gained while collaborating with the United States during the [[Manhattan Project]]. The [[United Kingdom]] was the third country in the world after the USA and USSR to develop and test a nuclear weapon. Its programme was motivated to have an independent deterrent against the USSR, while also maintaining its status as a [[great power]]. It tested its first hydrogen bomb in 1957 ([[Operation Grapple]]), making it the third country to do so after the USA and USSR. <ref>{{cite book|first=Margaret|last=Gowing|title=Independence and deterrence: Britain and atomic energy, 1945-1952 |location=London |publisher=Macmillan |year=1974|isbn=0333157818}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Lorna|last=Arnold|title=Britain and the H-bomb|location=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave|year=2001|isbn=0312235186}}</ref> The UK maintained a fleet of [[V bomber]] [[strategic bombers]] and [[ballistic missile submarine|ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs)]] equipped with nuclear weapons during the Cold War.

* '''{{flag|France}}''' {{Main|France and weapons of mass destruction}}
:France tested its first nuclear weapon in 1960 ("[[Gerboise Bleue]]"), based mostly on its own research. It was motivated by the [[Suez Crisis]] diplomatic tension ''vis-à-vis'' both the USSR and the [[Free World]] allies United States and United Kingdom. It was also relevant to retain [[great power]] status, alongside the United Kingdom, during the post-colonial [[Cold War]] (see: [[Force de frappe]]). France tested its first hydrogen bomb in 1968 ("[[Canopus (nuclear test)|Opération Canopus]]"). After the Cold War, France has disarmed 175 warheads with the reduction and modernization of its arsenal that has now evolved to a dual system based on submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and medium-range air-to-surface missiles ([[Rafale]] fighter-bombers). However new nuclear weapons are in development and reformed nuclear squadrons were trained during [[Enduring Freedom]] operations in Afghanistan. In January 2006, President [[Jacques Chirac]] stated a terrorist act or the use of [[weapons of mass destruction]] against France would result in a nuclear counterattack. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4627862.stm France 'would use nuclear arms'] (BBC, January 2006)</ref> .

:India is not a Party to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]]. India tested what it called a "[[Peaceful nuclear explosions|peaceful nuclear explosive]]" in 1974 (which became known as "[[Smiling Buddha]]"). The test was the first test developed after the creation of the NPT, and created new questions about how civilian nuclear technology could be diverted secretly to weapons purposes ([[dual-use technology]]). India's secret development caused great concern and anger particularly from nations, such as Canada, that had supplied its nuclear reactors for peaceful and power generating needs. It appears to have been primarily motivated as a general deterrent, as well as an attempt to project India as a regional power.  .

* '''{{flag|Pakistan}}''' {{Main|Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction}}
:Pakistan also is not a Party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Pakistan covertly developed nuclear weapons over many decades, beginning in the late 1970s. Pakistan first delved into nuclear power after the establishment of its first nuclear power plant near [[Karachi]] with equipment and materials supplied mainly by western nations in the early 1970s. [[Pakistani Prime Minister]] [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]] promised in 1965 that if India can build nuclear weapons then Pakistan would too, "even if we have to eat grass." The United States continued to certify that Pakistan did not possess nuclear weapons until 1990, when sanctions were imposed under the [[Larry Pressler|Pressler Amendment]], requiring a cutoff of U.S. economic and military assistance to Pakistan. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iie.com/research/topics/sanctions/pakistan.cfm |title=Case Studies in Sanctions and Terrorism: Pakistan |publisher=Iie.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-15}}</ref> In 1998, Pakistan conducted its first [[Chagai-I|six nuclear tests]] at the [[Chagai Hills]], in response to the five tests conducted by India a few weeks before. Over the years, Pakistan has developed into a crucial nuclear power.  . 

:In 2004, the Pakistani metallurgist [[A.Q. Khan]], a key figure in Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, confessed to heading an international [[black market]] ring involved in selling nuclear weapons technology. In particular, Khan had been selling [[gas centrifuge]] technology to North Korea, Iran, and Libya.

:North Korea was a Party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, but announced a withdrawal on January 10, 2003, after the United States accused it of having a secret [[uranium enrichment]] program and cut off energy assistance under the 1994 [[Agreed Framework]]. In February 2005 the North Koreans claimed to possess functional nuclear weapons, though their lack of a test at the time led many experts to doubt the claim. However, in October 2006, North Korea stated that due to growing intimidation by the USA, it would conduct a nuclear test to confirm its nuclear status. North Korea reported a successful nuclear test on October 9, 2006 (see [[2006 North Korean nuclear test]]). Most U.S. intelligence officials believe that North Korea did, in fact, test a nuclear device due to radioactive isotopes detected by U.S. aircraft; however, most agree that the test was probably only partially successful. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/3/28/83234.shtml |title=CIA's Hayden: North Korea Nuke Test 'Was a Failure' |publisher=Newsmax.com |date=2007-03-28 |accessdate=2009-05-15}}</ref> The [[nuclear weapon yield|yield]] may have been less than a [[kiloton]], which is much smaller than the first successful tests of other powers; however, [[boosted fission weapon]]s may have an unboosted yield in this range, which is sufficient to start deuterium-[[tritium]] fusion in the boost gas at the center; the fast neutrons from fusion then ensure a full fission yield.  North Korea conducted a second, higher yield test on May 25, 2009 (see [[2009 North Korean nuclear test]]).  .

==States formerly possessing nuclear weapons==. 
Nuclear weapons have been present in many nations, often as staging grounds under control of other powers. However, in only one instance has a nation given up nuclear weapons after being in control of them; in most cases this has been because of special political circumstances. The [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the USSR]], for example, left several [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet republics]] in possession of nuclear weapons.  .

:South Africa produced six nuclear weapons in the 1980s, but disassembled them in the early 1990s. In 1979, there was a putative detection of a clandestine nuclear test in the Indian Ocean, and it has long been speculated that it was possibly a test by South Africa, perhaps in collaboration with Israel, though this has never been confirmed (see [[Vela Incident]]). South Africa signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1991. <ref>[http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/rsa/nuke/index.html Nuclear Weapons Program (South Africa)], [[Federation of American Scientists]] (May 29, 2000). </ref> . 

===Former Soviet countries===. 
* '''{{flag|Belarus}}''' had 81 single warhead missiles stationed on its territory after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. They were all transferred to Russia by 1996. Belarus has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. <ref>[http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/belarus/index.html Belarus Special Weapons], [[Federation of American Scientists]]</ref>
* '''{{flag|Kazakhstan}}''' inherited 1,400 nuclear weapons from the Soviet Union, and transferred them all to Russia by 1995. Kazakhstan has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. <ref>[http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/kazakhstan/index.html Kazakhstan Special Weapons], [[Federation of American Scientists]]</ref>
* '''{{flag|Ukraine}}''' has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Ukraine inherited about 5,000 nuclear weapons when it became independent from the USSR in 1991, making its nuclear arsenal the third-largest in the world. <ref>[http://globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/ukraine/index.html Ukraine Special Weapons], [[GlobalSecurity.org]]</ref> By 1996, Ukraine had voluntarily disposed of all nuclear weapons within its territory, transferring them to Russia. <ref>[http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/ukraine/ Ukraine Special Weapons], [[Federation of American Scientists]]</ref> .
