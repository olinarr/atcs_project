US intelligence predicted in August 2005 that Iran could have the key ingredients for a nuclear weapon by 2015. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/01/AR2005080101453.html |title=Iran Is Judged 10 Years From Nuclear Bomb |work=The Washington Post  |date=2 August 2005 |accessdate=23 November 2011 |first=Dafna |last=Linzer}}</ref> On 25 October 2007, the United States declared the [[Revolutionary Guards]] a "proliferator of weapons of mass destruction", and the [[Quds Force]] a "supporter of terrorism". <ref name="BBC-USLabel">{{cite news|date=2007-10-25|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7061991.stm|title=US imposes new sanctions on Iran|publisher=BBC News }}</ref> Iran responded that "it is incongruent for a country [US] who itself is a producer of weapons of mass destruction to take such a decision."<ref name="BBC-USLabel" /> [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], director of the IAEA at the time, said he had no evidence Iran was building nuclear weapons and accused US leaders of adding "fuel to the fire" with their rhetoric. <ref>[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22664498-5005961,00.html No evidence Iran is making nukes: ElBaradei]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> Speaking in Washington in November 2007, days before the IAEA was to publish its latest report, Israeli Deputy Prime Minister [[Shaul Mofaz]] called for ElBaradei to be sacked, saying: "The policies followed by ElBaradei endanger world peace.

Israel and some western governments fear Iran is using its nuclear programme as a covert means to develop weapons, while Iran says it is aimed solely at producing electricity. For its part in the conflict-ridden Middle East, Israel is a member of the IAEA, but it is not itself a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and is widely believed to currently be the only nuclear-armed state in the region. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7085213.stm|date=2007-11-08|title=Israel minister: Sack ElBaradei|publisher=BBC News }}</ref> . 

===History===. 
The United States and Western European governments actively encouraged and participated in Iran's nuclear program,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranaffairs.com/iran_affairs/2006/05/blasts_from_the.html |title=Blasts from the Past: Western Support for Iran's Nuclear program -IranAffairs.com, May 30, 2006 |publisher=Iranaffairs.com |date=30 May 2006 |accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref> through the [[Atoms for Peace]] program, and under the [[monarchy|Iranian monarchy]] of [[Shah]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], Iran signed the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] on 1 July 1968  and ratified the treaty on 2 February 1970. <ref name="npt">{{cite web

There are various estimates of when Iran might be able to produce a nuclear weapon, should it choose to do so:
*A 2005 assessment by the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] concluded "if Iran threw caution to the wind, and sought a nuclear weapon capability as quickly as possible without regard for international reaction, it might be able to produce enough HEU for a single nuclear weapon by the end of this decade", assuming no technical problems. The report concludes, however, that it is unlikely that Iran would flatly ignore international reactions and develop nuclear weapons anyway. <ref name="IISSassessment">{{cite web |url=http://www.iiss.org/publications/strategic-dossiers/irans-strategic-weapons-programmes |accessdate=2006-06-03 |title=Iran's Strategic Weapons Programmes – A Net Assessment |year=2005 |publisher=International Institute for Strategic Studies}}</ref>
*A 2005 US [[National Intelligence Estimate]] stated that Iran was ten years from making a nuclear weapon. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/01/AR2005080101453.html |accessdate=2007-09-20 |title=Iran Is Judged 10 Years From Nuclear Bomb U.S. Intelligence Review Contrasts With Administration Statements |work=Washington Post | first=Dafna | last=Linzer | date=2005-08-02}}</ref>
*In 2006 [[Ernst Uhrlau]], the head of German [[Bundesnachrichtendienst|intelligence service]], said Tehran would not be able to produce enough material for a nuclear bomb before 2010 and would only be able to make it into a weapon by about 2015. <ref>[http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKL242351720061024 Iran could have nuclear bomb by 2015] [[Reuters]] 24 October 2006</ref>
* A 2007 annual review the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London stated that "If and when Iran does have 3,000 centrifuges operating smoothly, the IISS estimates it would take an additional 9-11 months to produce 25&nbsp;kg of highly enriched uranium, enough for one implosion-type weapon.

*The former head of the IAEA, Mohamed ElBaradei, said on 24 May 2007 that Iran could take between 3 and 8 years to make a bomb if it went down that route. <ref name="IISS2007assessment"/>
*On 22 October 2007, Mohamed ElBaradei repeated that, even assuming Iran was trying to develop a nuclear bomb, they would require "between another three and eight years to succeed", an assessment shared by "all the intelligence services". <ref name=irishtimes-20071022>{{cite news|title=Iran bomb would take '3–8 years' to build|work=The Irish Times |date=2007-10-22|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2007/1022/breaking29.html|accessdate=2007-10-22}}</ref>
* In December 2007, the United States [[National Intelligence Estimate]] (representing the consensus view of all 16 American intelligence agencies) concluded with a "high level of confidence" that Iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 and "with moderate confidence" that the program remains frozen as of mid-2007.

The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) is an autonomous international organization that seeks to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy and to inhibit its use for military purposes.  . 

On 6 March 2006, the IAEA Secretariat reported that "''the Agency has not seen indications of diversion of nuclear material to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ... however, after three years of intensive verification, there remain uncertainties with regard to both the scope and the nature of Iran's nuclear programme''". <ref name="iaea statement">{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Statements/2006/ebsp2006n003.html#iran

On 18 December 2003, Iran voluntarily signed, but did not ratify or bring into force, an Additional Protocol that allows [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] inspectors access to individuals, documentation relating to procurement, [[dual-use technology|dual-use equipment]], certain military-owned workshops, and research and development locations. <ref name="IAEA-GOV/2005/87">{{Cite book|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Board/2005/gov2005-87.pdf |accessdate=2006-04-17|title=Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement in the Islamic Republic of Iran|date=18 November 2005|id=GOV/2005/87|publisher=IAEA |format=PDF}}</ref> Iran agreed voluntarily to implement the Additional Protocol provisionally, however when the IAEA reported Iran's non-compliance to the [[United Nations Security Council]] on 4 February 2006 Iran withdrew from its voluntary adherence to the Additional Protocol. <ref name="HCFAC-20080220">{{Cite book|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmfaff/142/14202.htm|title=Global Security: Iran|date=20 February 2008|publisher=House of Commons [[Foreign Affairs Select Committee]]|accessdate=2008-03-02}}</ref> . 

On 12 May 2006, claims that highly-enriched uranium (well over the 3.5% enriched level) was reported to have been found "at a site where Iran has denied such sensitive atomic work", appeared. "They have found particles of highly enriched uranium [HEU], but it is not clear if this is contamination from centrifuges that had been previously found [from imported material] or something new," said one diplomat close to the UN International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

On 31 July 2006,  the [[United Nations Security Council]] passed a resolution demanding that Iran suspend its uranium enrichment activities. <ref name="UNSEC Res" /> . 

In late 2006, "New traces of plutonium and enriched uranium– potential material for atomic warheads– have been found [by the IAEA] in a nuclear waste facility in Iran." However, "A senior U.N. official who was familiar with the report cautioned against reading too much into the findings of traces of highly enriched uranium and plutonium, saying Iran had explained both and they could plausibly be classified as byproducts of peaceful nuclear activities."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2006-11/15/content_733403.htm|title=IAEA finds traces of plutonium in Iran|agency=Associated Press|date=2006-11-15|accessdate=2007-03-01}}</ref> In 2007 these traces were determined to have come from leaking used highly enriched uranium fuel from the [[Tehran Research Reactor‎]], which the U.S. supplied to Iran in 1967, and the matter was closed. <ref name="IAEA-GOV/2007/48">{{Cite book|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Board/2007/gov2007-48.pdf |accessdate=2007-10-25|title=Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement in the Islamic Republic of Iran|date=30 August 2007|id=GOV/2007/48|publisher=IAEA|format=PDF}}</ref> .

In August 2007 the IAEA announced that Iran has agreed to a plan to resolve key questions regarding its past nuclear activities. The IAEA described this as a "significant step forward". <ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6970488.stm|title=Iran accepts fresh nuclear plan|publisher=BBC News |date=2007-07-30|accessdate=2007-07-30}}</ref> . 

In September 2007  the IAEA announced it has been able to verify that Iran's declared nuclear material has not been diverted from peaceful use. While the IAEA has been unable to verify some "important aspects" regarding the nature and scope of Iran's nuclear work, the agency and Iranian officials agreed on a plan to resolve all outstanding issues, Director-General Mohamed ElBaradei said at the time. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/09/17/france.iran/index.html|title=Iran angry with France over war warning|publisher=CNN|date=2007-09-17|accessdate=17 September 2007}}</ref> In an interview with [[Radio Audizioni Italiane]] the same month, ElBaradei remarked that "Iran does not constitute a certain and immediate threat for the international community". <ref>[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2007%5C09%5C22%5Cstory_22-9-2007_pg4_14 Tehran not an 'immediate threat'] [[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]] 22 September 2007</ref> In October 2007, ElBaradei amplified these remarks, telling [[Le Monde]] that, even if Iran did intend to develop a nuclear bomb, they would need "between another three and eight years to succeed". He went on to note that "all the intelligence services" agree with this assessment and that he wanted to "get people away from the idea that Iran will be a threat from tomorrow, and that we are faced right now with the issue of whether Iran should be bombed or allowed to have the bomb". <ref name=irishtimes-20071022 /> . 

In late October 2007, according to the [[International Herald Tribune]], the former head of the IAEA, Mohamed ElBaradei, stated that he had seen "no evidence" of Iran developing nuclear weapons. The IHT quoted ElBaredei as stating that,
<blockquote>
"We have information that there has been maybe some studies about possible weaponization," said Mohamed ElBaradei, who led the International Atomic Energy Agency. "That's why we have said that we cannot give Iran a pass right now, because there is still a lot of question marks." . 

"But have we seen Iran having the nuclear material that can readily be used into a weapon? No. Have we seen an active weaponization program? No."</blockquote> . 

The IHT report went on to say that "ElBaradei said he was worried about the growing rhetoric from the U.S., which he noted focused on Iran's alleged intentions to build a nuclear weapon rather than evidence the country was actively doing so. If there is actual evidence, ElBaradei said he would welcome seeing it."<ref name=IHT_102907>{{cite news|title=UN nuclear watchdog chief expresses concern about anti-Iran rhetoric from US|work=International Herald Tribune|date=28 October 2007|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/28/america/NA-GEN-US-Iran.php|accessdate=2007-10-29}}</ref> .

Answers provided by Iran regarding the past P-1 and P-2 centrifuge programs were found to be consistent with the IAEA's own findings. However, Iran has ignored the demands of the UN Security council, and has continued to enrich uranium in the past year. The IAEA is not able to conclusively confirm that Iran isn't currently enriching uranium for military purposes, as its inspections have been restricted to workshops previously declared as part of the civilian uranium enrichment program, and requests for access to certain military workshops have been denied; the report noted that "As a result, the agency's knowledge about Iran's current nuclear program is diminishing". The report also confirmed that Iran now possesses 3000 centrifuges, a 10-fold increase over the past year, though the feed rate is below the maximum for a facility of this design. Data regarding the P-2 centrifuge, which Ahmadinejad has claimed will quadruple production of enriched uranium, was provided only several days before the report was published; the IAEA plan to discuss this issue further in December. In response to the report the US has vowed to push for more sanctions, whilst Iran has called for an apology from the US. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7098751.stm|title=Iran calls for US nuclear apology|date=2007-11-16|publisher=BBC News }}</ref> . 

In his final November 2009 statement to the IAEA Board of Governors, Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei said the Agency continued to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran, but that other issues of concern had reached a "dead end" unless Iran were to fully cooperate with the agency. ElBaradei stated it would be helpful if "we were able to share with Iran more of the material that is at the centre of these concerns", and also said it would be helpful if Iran fully implemented the Subsidiary Arrangements to its Safeguards Agreement and fully implemented the Additional Protocol. ElBaradei said Iran's failure to report the existence of a new fuel enrichment facility until September 2009 was inconsistent with its obligations under the Subsidiary Arrangements to its Safeguards Agreement. ElBaradei closed by saying international negotiations represented a "unique opportunity to address a humanitarian need and create space for negotiations". <ref>{{cite web|author=Austria |url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Statements/2009/ebsp2009n021.html |title=International Atomic Energy Agency: Introductory Statement to the Board of Governors by IAEA Director General Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei (26 November 2009) |publisher=Iaea.org |accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref> . 

On 18 February 2010 the IAEA released a new report on Iran's nuclear program. Ivan Oelrich and Ivanka Barzashka, writing in the [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]], suggested "the media has seriously misrepresented the actual contents of the report" and that "in fact, no new information has been revealed."

In an April 2010 interview with the BBC, former IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei said Western nations were seeking harsher sanctions "out of frustration". "I don't think Iran is developing, or we have new information that Iran is developing, a nuclear weapon today .. there is a concern about Iran's future intentions, but even if you talk to MI6 or the CIA, they will tell you they are still four or five years away from a weapon. So, we have time to engage," he said.  ElBaradei further said the building of trust between the parties would "not happen until the two sides sit around the negotiating table and address their grievances.

"The Agency is still awaiting a reply from Iran to its request to meet relevant Iranian authorities in connection with these issues", the report said. The report further said, "it would be helpful if Member States which have provided documentation to the Agency would agree to share more of that documentation with Iran, as appropriate."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://isis-online.org/uploads/isis-reports/documents/IAEA_Report_Iran_16November2009pdf_1.pdf |title=International Atomic Energy Agency: Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement and relevant provisions of Security Council resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007), 1803 (2008) and 1835 (2008) in the Islamic Republic of Iran |format=PDF |accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news

===The Iranian stance===. 
{{Main|Nuclear program of Iran#The Iranian viewpoint}} . 

Iran states the purpose of its nuclear program is the generation of power and that any other use would be a violation of the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]], of which it is a signatory, as well as being against Islamic religious principles. Iran claims that nuclear power is necessary for a booming population and rapidly-industrialising nation. It points to the fact that Iran's population has more than doubled in 20 years, the country regularly imports gasoline and electricity, and that burning fossil fuel in large amounts harms Iran's environment drastically. Additionally, Iran questions why it shouldn't be allowed to diversify its sources of energy, especially when there are fears of its oil fields eventually being depleted. It continues to argue that its valuable oil should be used for high value products and export, not simple electricity generation. Furthermore, Iran argues that nuclear power makes fairly good economic sense. Building reactors is expensive, but subsequent operating costs are low and stable, and increasingly competitive as fossil-fuel prices rise. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_SJSTTNV&CFID=95062603&CFTOKEN=c91bea-f43e23b8-577e-4e51-80d2-e8f667401fe4 |title=Egypt & Nuclear Power |work=The Economist  |accessdate=23 November 2011 |date=28 September 2006}}</ref> Iran also raises funding questions, claiming that developing the excess capacity in its oil industry would cost it $40 billion, not to speak of paying for the power plants. Harnessing nuclear power costs a fraction of this, considering Iran has abundant supplies of accessible [[uranium]] ore. <ref>[http://www.aeoi.org.ir/newweb/Fuel/Saghand/Saghand.htm Saghand Mining Department Website]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> These claims have been [http://www.campaigniran.org/casmii/index.php?q=node/1493 echoed] by [[Scott Ritter]], the former UN weapons inspector in Iraq.

Iran states it has a legal right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes under the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|NPT]], and further says that it "has constantly complied with its obligations under the NPT and the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency". <ref name=InfCirc724>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/2008/infcirc724.pdf |title=IAEA Information Circular 724 (March 2008): Communication from the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the Agency |format=PDF |accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref> Twelve other countries are known to operate [[Enriched uranium#Global enrichment facilities|uranium enrichment facilities]].

Iran has criticized the European Union because it believes it has taken no steps to reduce the danger of nuclear weapons in the Middle East. <ref name=IranDAConf /> Iran has called on the state of Israel to sign the NPT, accept inspection of its nuclear facilities, and place its nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards. <ref name=IranDAConf /> Iran has proposed that the Middle East be established as a proposed Nuclear Weapon Free Zone. <ref name=IranDAConf /> . 

On 3 December 2004, Iran's former president and an Islamic cleric,
[[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]] alluded to Iran's position on nuclear energy: . 

''<blockquote>God willing, we expect to soon join the club of the countries that have a nuclear industry, with all its branches, except the military one, in which we are not interested. We want to get what we're entitled to. I say unequivocally that for no price will we be willing to relinquish our legal and international right. I also say unequivocally to those who make false claims: Iran is not pursuing nuclear weapons, but it will not give up its rights. Your provocation will not make us pursue nuclear weapons. We hope that you come to your senses soon and do not get the world involved in disputes and crises.''<ref>[http://memritv.org/Transcript.asp?P1=399 ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref></blockquote> . 

On 14 November 2004, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator said that his country agreed to voluntarily and temporarily suspend the uranium enrichment program after pressure from the [[European Union]] on behalf of the United Kingdom, France and Germany, as a confidence-building measure for a reasonable period of time, with six months mentioned as a reference.  . 

Iranian president [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] has publicly stated Iran is not developing nuclear weapons. On 9 August 2005 Iran's Supreme Leader, [[Ayatollah]] [[Ali Khamenei]], issued a [[fatwa]] that the production, stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons are forbidden under Islam and that Iran shall never acquire these weapons. The text of the fatwa has not been released although it was referenced in an official statement at a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna. <ref name="fatwa">{{cite web|url=http://www.iran-daily.com/1384/2347/html/index.htm|publisher=Iran Daily|date=2005-08-11|title=Leader's Fatwa Forbids Nukes|accessdate=2006-05-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060322134428/http://www.iran-daily.com/1384/2347/html/index.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-03-22}}</ref> . 

[[President of Iran|Iranian President]] [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] in a 2005 speech to the [[United Nations General Assembly|U.N. General Assembly]] said "We are concerned that once certain powerful states completely control nuclear energy resources and technology, they will deny access to other states and thus deepen the divide between powerful countries and the rest of the international community ... peaceful use of nuclear energy without possession of a nuclear fuel cycle is an empty proposition". <ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4257278.stm |title=UK &#124; UK Politics &#124; Iranian president's UN speech |publisher=BBC News  |date=18 September 2005 |accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref> . 

On 6 August 2005, Iran rejected a 34 page European Union proposal intended to help Iran build "a safe, economically viable and proliferation-proof civil nuclear power generation and research program."  The Europeans, with US agreement, intended to entice Iran into a binding commitment not to develop uranium enrichment capability by offering to provide fuel and other long-term support that would facilitate electricity generation with nuclear energy. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi rejected the proposal saying, "We had already announced that any plan has to recognize Iran's right to enrich uranium". <ref name="aljazeera9356">{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/me.asp?service_ID=9356|title=Iran rejects "unacceptable" EU nuclear proposals|accessdate=2006-05-19|publisher=Al Jazeera Magazine Online Edition|year=2005}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> After the Iranian Revolution, Germany halted construction of the Bushehr reactor, the United States cut off supply of highly enriched uranium (HEU) fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor, and Iran never received uranium from France which it asserted it was entitled to. Russia agreed not to provide an enrichment plant and terminated cooperation on several other nuclear-related technologies, including laser isotope separation; China terminated several nuclear projects (in return, in part for entry into force of a U.S.-China civil nuclear cooperation agreement); and Ukraine agreed not to provide the turbine for Bushehr. Iran argues that these experiences contribute to a perception that foreign nuclear supplies are potentially subject to being interrupted. <ref>"Internationalization of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle: Goals, Strategies, and Challenges (2009).

Iran resumed its [[enriched uranium|uranium enrichment]] program in January 2006, prompting the IAEA to refer the issue to the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]].  . 

On 21 February 2006, [[Rooz]], a news website run by Iranian exiles, reported that Hojatoleslam Mohsen Gharavian, a student of Qom's fundamentalist cleric [[Mohammad Taghi Mesbah Yazdi|Mesbah Yazdi]], spoke about the necessity of using nuclear weapons as a means to retaliate and announced that "based on religious law, everything depends on our purpose". <ref name="rooz21feb06">{{cite web|url=http://roozonline.com/11english/014154.shtml|title=Iranian Cleric Okays Use of Nuclear Weapons!|accessdate=2006-09-29|publisher=Rooz|year=2006|author=Shahram Rafizadeh}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In an  interview with the [[Islamic Republic News Agency]] the same day, Gharavian rejected these reports, saying "We do not seek nuclear weapons and the Islamic religion encourages coexistence along with peace and friendship...these websites have tried to misquote me."<ref name="IRNA21feb06">{{cite web|url=http://www.muslimnews.co.uk/news/news.php?article=10676|title=Islam forbids use of nuclear weapons: Theological scholar |accessdate=2006-09-29|publisher=The Muslim News|year=2006|author=IRNA}}</ref> . 

On 11 April 2006, Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] announced Iranian scientists working at the pilot facility at [[Natanz]] had successfully enriched uranium to the 3.5 percent level, using a small cascade of 164 [[gas centrifuge]]s. In the televised address from the city of [[Mashhad]] he said, "I am officially announcing that Iran has joined the group of those countries which have [[nuclear technology]]". <ref name="npr5336802">{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5336802|title=Iran Enriches Uranium, Plans New Expansion|accessdate=2006-05-20|publisher=National Public Radio|year=2006|author=Shuster, Mike}}</ref> . 

In May 2006 some members of the Iranian legislature ("[[Majlis]]" or Parliament) sent a letter to UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] threatening to withdraw from the NPT if Iran's right to peaceful use of nuclear technology under the treaty was not protected. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/05/iran-lawmakers-threaten-withdrawal.php |title=Iran lawmakers threaten withdrawal from Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty |publisher=Jurist.law.pitt.edu |date=7 May 2006 |accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref> . 

On 21 February 2007, the same day the UN deadline to suspend nuclear activities expired, [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] made the following statement: "If they say that we should close down our fuel production facilities to resume talks, we say fine, but those who enter talks with us should also close down their nuclear fuel production activities". The [[White House]]'s spokesperson [[Tony Snow]] rejected the offer and called it a "false offer". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07/02/21/1523228 |title=As Nuclear Deadline Passes, US and Iran Trade Accusations of Bombing Involvement |publisher=Democracy Now! |accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref> . 

Iran has said that U.N. Security Council sanctions aimed at curtailing its uranium-enrichment activities unfairly target its medical sector. "We have thousands of patients a month at our hospital alone .. If we can't help them, some will die. It's as simple as that," said an Iranian nuclear medicine specialist. An Iranian Jew from California claimed "I don't believe in these sanctions... They hurt normal people, not leaders. What is the use of that?"  Vice President of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran Ghannadi framed the debate as a humanitarian issue, "This is about human beings. . . . When someone is sick, we should give medicine." Iran informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that fuel obtained from Argentina in 1993 would run out by the end of 2010, and that it could produce the uranium itself or buy the uranium from abroad. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/19/AR2009121902171_2.html?sid=ST2009121902756 |title='&#39;Washington Post'&#39;: In Iran, nuclear issue is also a medical one |work=The Washington Post  |date=19 December 2009 |accessdate=23 November 2011 |first1=Thomas |last1=Erdbrink |first2=William |last2=Branigin}}</ref> .

Others have noted that while possession of the technology "contributes to the latency of non-nuclear weapon states in their potential to acquire nuclear weapons" but that such latency is not necessarily evidence of intent to proceed toward the acquisition of nuclear weapons, since "intent is in the eye of the beholder". <ref>{{cite web

*A potential reason behind U.S. resistance to an Iranian nuclear program lies in Middle Eastern geopolitics. In essence, the US feels that it must guard against even the possibility of Iran obtaining a nuclear weapons capability. Some nuclear technology is [[dual-use technology|dual-use]]; i.e. it can be used for peaceful energy generation, and to develop nuclear weapons, a situation that resulted in [[India]]'s [[India and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons program]] in the 1960s. A nuclear-armed Iran would dramatically change the balance of power in the Middle East, weakening US influence. It could also encourage other Middle Eastern nations to develop nuclear weapons of their own further reducing US influence in a critical region. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/iran/nuke.htm|title=Nuclear Weapons – Iran|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|accessdate=2009-11-05}}</ref> .

* In September 2007, [[Condoleezza Rice]], [[U.S. Secretary of State]], cautioned the IAEA not to interfere with international diplomacy over Iran's alleged weapons program. She said the IAEA's role should be limited to carrying out inspections and offering a "clear declaration and clear reporting on what the Iranians are doing; whether and when and if they are living up to the agreements they have signed." Former IAEA Director General ElBaradei called for less emphasis on additional UN sanctions and more emphasis on enhanced cooperation between the IAEA and Tehran. Iran has agreed with IAEA requests to answer unresolved questions about its nuclear program. ElBaradei often criticized what he called "war mongering," only to be told by Rice to mind his business. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/09/19/rice.iran/index.html |title=Rice tells nuke watchdog to butt out of Iran diplomacy |publisher=CNN  |date=19 September 2007 |accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref> . 

* In December 2007, the United States [[National Intelligence Estimate]] (which represents the consensus view of all 16 American spy agencies) concluded, with a "high level of confidence", that Iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 and that the program remains frozen. The new estimate says that the enrichment program could still provide Iran with enough raw material to produce a nuclear weapon sometime by the middle of next decade but that intelligence agencies "do not know whether it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons" at some future date.

In January 2010, China reiterated its calls for diplomatic efforts on the Iran nuclear issue over sanctions.  "Dialogue and negotiations are the right ways of properly solving the Iran nuclear issue, and there is still room for diplomatic efforts," said Chinese spokesperson Jiang Yu.  "We hope the relevant parties take more flexible and pragmatic measures and step up diplomatic efforts in a bid to resume talks as soon as possible," said Jiang. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2010-01/05/content_12759244.htm |title='&#39;Xinhua'&#39;: China calls for diplomacy as U.S. weighs sanctions on Iran |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=5 January 2010 |accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref> .

On 16 February 2006 French Foreign Minister [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]] said "No civilian nuclear programme can explain the Iranian nuclear programme.

In January 2007, former French President [[Jacques Chirac]], speaking "off the record" to reporters from [[The New York Times]], indicated that if Iran possessed a nuclear weapon, the weapon could not be used. Chirac alluded to [[mutually assured destruction]] when he stated:<ref name="nyt010207">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/01/world/europe/01france.html?ex=1327986000&en=2a79cb363a6d7afd&ei=5088?ner=rssnyt&emc=rss|title=Chirac Strays From Assailing a Nuclear Iran|accessdate=2007-06-01|work=New York Times| first1=Elaine | last1=Sciolino | first2=Katrin | last2=Bennhold | date=2007-02-01}}</ref>

In 2005, Russian Advisor to Minister of Atomic Energy Lev Ryabev asserted that "neither the signing by Iran of the NPT, the adoption of the Additional Protocol (which provides for the right of inspection of any facility at any time with no prior notice), placement of nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards, nor Russia's and Iran's commitments to repatriate spent nuclear fuel to Russia is seen as a good enough argument by the United States." Ryabev argued that "at the same time, such requirements are not imposed on, for example, Brazil, which has been developing its nuclear power industry and nuclear fuel cycle, including uranium enrichment."<ref>[http://books.nap.edu/openbook/0309096693/gifmid/57.gif Strengthening U.S-Russian Cooperation on Nuclear Nonproliferation (2005) Development, Security, and Cooperation (DSC) (page 57)].

In 2009, Russian Major-General Pavel S.

In May 2009, the [[EastWest Institute]] released a joint U.S.-Russian Threat Assessment on Iran's Nuclear and Missile Potential. The report concluded that there was "no IRBM/ICBM threat from Iran and that such a threat, even if it were to emerge, is not imminent." The report said there was no specific evidence that Iran was seeking the ability to attack Europe and that "it is indeed difficult to imagine the circumstances in which Iran would do so." The report said if Iran did pursue this capability, it would need six to eight years to develop a missile capable of carrying a 1,000 kilogram warhead 2,000 kilometers. The report said Iran ending "IAEA containment and surveillance of the nuclear material and all installed cascades at the Fuel Enrichment Plan" might serve as an early warning of Iranian intentions. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ploughshares.org/sites/default/files/resources/20090516_ewi_iransnucleamissilepotential.pdf |title=East-West Institute: Iran's Nuclear and Missile Potential |format=PDF |accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref> . 

In December 2009, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that the Iran nuclear issue would be resolved by diplomatic methods exclusively. "It is absolutely clear that the problem can be settled exclusively by political and diplomatic methods and any other scenarios, especially use-of-force scenarios, are completely unacceptable," Lavrov said. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20091222/157322284.html |title='&#39;RIA Novosti'&#39;: Russia's Lavrov urges diplomatic solution to Iran nuclear issue |publisher=En.rian.ru |date=22 December 2009 |accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref> Yevgeny Primakov, a former Russian prime minister considered the doyen of Moscow's Middle East experts, said he did not believe that Iran had made a decision to acquire nuclear weapons.

The movement further called for the establishment of a nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle East and called for a comprehensive multilaterally negotiated instrument which prohibits threats of attacks on nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful uses of nuclear energy. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/2008/infcirc733.pdf |title=XV Ministerial Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement (July 2008): Statement on the Islamic Republic of Iran's Nuclear Issue |format=PDF |accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref> . 

==Biological weapons==. 
Iran ratified the [[Biological Weapons Convention]] on 22 August 1973. <ref name=OPBW>{{cite web|url=http://www.opbw.org/convention/status.html |title=Signatories of the Biological Weapons Convention |publisher=Opbw.org |accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref> . 

Iran has advanced biology and genetic engineering research programs supporting an industry that produces world-class vaccines for both domestic use and export. <ref name="vacc">{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/00/oct/1067.html|title=Razi Institute produces dlrs 100 m worth of vaccines, serums a year |accessdate=2006-04-22}}</ref> The dual-use nature of these facilities means that Iran, like any country with advanced biological research programs, could easily produce biological warfare agents.  . 

A 2005 report from the [[United States Department of State]] claimed that Iran began work on offensive biological weapons during the [[Iran–Iraq War]], and that their large legitimate bio-technological and bio-medical industry "could easily hide pilot to industrial-scale production capabilities for a potential BW program, and could mask procurement of BW-related process equipment". The report further said that "available information about Iranian activities indicates a maturing offensive program with a rapidly evolving capability that may soon include the ability to deliver these weapons by a variety of means". <ref>Bureau of Verification and Compliance,
U.S. Department of State, "Adherence to and Compliance With Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament Agreements and Commitments" (30 August 2005). </ref> . 

According to the [[Nuclear Threat Initiative]], Iran is known to possess cultures of the many [[biological agent]]s for legitimate scientific purposes which have been weaponised by other nations in the past, or could theoretically be weaponised. Although they do not allege that Iran has attempted to weaponise them, Iran possesses sufficient biological facilities to potentially do so. <ref name="bioref">{{cite web|url=http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/Iran/Biological/2302.html

==Chemical weapons==. 
[[Image:Chemical weapon1.jpg|thumb|300px|Iranian soldier with [[gas mask]] under [[Chemical warfare|Chemical bombardment]] by Iraqi forces in the battlefield during the [[Iran–Iraq War]].]] . 

Iran has experienced attack by chemical warfare (CW) on the battlefield and suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties, both civilian and military, in such attacks during the 1980–88 [[Iran–Iraq War]]. As a result, Iran has promulgated a very public stance against the use of chemical weapons, making numerous vitriolic comments against Iraq's use of such weapons in international forums. Iran is not known to have resorted to using chemical weapons in retaliation for Iraqi chemical weapons attacks during the Iran–Iraq War, though it would have been legally entitled to do so under the then-existing international treaties on the use of chemical weapons which only prohibited the first use of such weapons. Following its experiences during the Iran–Iraq War, Iran signed the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] on 13 January 1993 and ratified it on 3 November 1997. In the official declaration submitted to OPCW Iranian government admitted that it had produced mustard gas in 1980s but that ceased the offensive program and destroyed the stockpiles of operational weapons after the end of war with Iraq. <ref>[http://cns.miis.edu/archive/cns/programs/dc/briefs/030701.htm Iranian Use of Chemical Weapons: A Critical Analysis of Past Allegations]</ref> . 

A U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] report dated January 2001 speculated that Iran had manufactured and stockpiled chemical weapons – including [[blister agent|blister]], [[blood agent|blood]], [[Pulmonary agent|choking]], and probably [[nerve agent]]s, and the bombs and artillery shells to deliver them. It further claimed that during the first half of 2001, Iran continued to seek production technology, training, expertise, equipment, and chemicals from entities in Russia and China that could be used to help Iran reach its goal of having indigenous nerve agent production capability. <ref name="cia-report">{{cite web|title=Unclassified Report to Congress on the Acquisition of Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional Munitions, 1 January Through 30 June 2001|accessdate=2006-04-26|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency (USA)|url=http://www.cia.gov/library/publications//bian/bian_jan_2002.htm  |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20020601133717/http://www.cia.gov/library/publications//bian/bian_jan_2002.htm |archivedate = 2002-06-01}}</ref> However the certainty of this assessment declined and in 2007 the U.S. [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] limited its public assessment to just noting that "Iran has a large and growing commercial chemical industry that could be used to support a chemical agent mobilization capability."<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.wmdinsights.com/I22/I22_ME2_Iran1stGenCW.htm|title=Iran's First-Generation Chemical Weapons Evaporate, as Certainty Declines in U.S. Intelligence Reports|author=Markus Binder|publisher=WMD Insights|date=February 2008|accessdate=2008-03-27}}</ref> .

==Delivery systems==. 
===Missiles===. 
Iran is believed to have a current{{as of?}} inventory of 25 to 100 [[Shahab-3]] missiles which have a range of 2,100&nbsp;km and are capable of being armed with conventional high explosive, submunition, chemical, biological, radiological dispersion and potentially nuclear warheads.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} A [[Shahab-4]] with a range of 2,000&nbsp;km and a payload of 1,000&nbsp;kg is believed to be under development. Iran has stated the Shahab-3 is the last of its war missiles and the Shahab-4 is being developed to give the country the capability of launching communications and surveillance satellites. A [[Shahab-5]], an [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] with a 10,000&nbsp;km range, has been alleged but not proven to be under development. <ref name="shahab-5">{{cite web

Iran has 12 [[Kh-55_(missile_family)|X-55]] long range [[cruise missile]]s purchased without nuclear warheads from [[Ukraine]] in 2001. The X-55 has a range of 2,500 to 3,000 kilometers. <ref name="x55">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/iran/x-55.htm|title=X-55 Long Range Cruise Missile|accessdate=2006-04-20|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|author=Pike, John}}</ref> . 

Iran's most advanced missile, the [[Fajr-3 ballistic missile|Fajr-3]], has an unknown range but is estimated to be 2,500&nbsp;km. The missile is radar evading and can strike targets simultaneously using multiple warheads. <ref>[http://www.missiledefenseadvocacy.org/index/Iran2006.html ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref>.  . 

On 2 November 2006, Iran fired unarmed missiles to begin 10 days of military [[military simulation|war games]]. Iranian state television reported "dozens of missiles were fired including [[Shahab-2]] and [[Shahab-3]] missiles. The missiles had ranges from 300 km to up to 2,000&nbsp;km...Iranian experts have made some changes to Shahab-3 missiles installing cluster [[warhead]]s in them with the capacity to carry 1,400 bombs." These launches come after some United States-led military exercises in the [[Persian Gulf]] on 30 October 2006, meant to train for blocking the transport of [[weapons of mass destruction]]. <ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/11/02/iran.manoeuvres.reut/index.html?section=cnn_latest ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref>  . 

The Sejil is a two-stage, solid-propellant, surface-to-surface missile (SSM) produced by Iran with a reported 1,930 km (1,200 mi) range. A successful test launch took place on 12 November 2008. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7725951.stm |title=Middle East &#124; Iran tests new long-range missile |publisher=BBC News  |date=13 November 2008 |accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref> . 

According to Jane's Information Group, details of the design other than the number of stages and that it uses solid fuel have not been released. Uzi Ruben, former director of Israel's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, indicated that, "Unlike other Iranian missiles, the Sajil bears no resemblance to any North Korean, Russian, Chinese or Pakistani (missile technology). It demonstrates a significant leap in Iran's missile capabilities." Rubin went on to state that the Sejil-1 " ... places Iran in the realm of multiple-stage missiles, which means that they are on the way to having intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capabilities ..."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/products/janes/defence-security-report.aspx?ID=1065927438 |title=Defence Security Report |publisher=Janes.com |date=14 November 2008 |accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref> As a weapon, the Sejil-1 presents much more challenge to Iran's potential enemies, as solid-fuel missiles can be launched with much less notice than liquid-fueled missiles, making them more difficult to strike prior to launch. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stratfor.com/memberships/126974/analysis/20081112_iran_u_s_missile_claims_and_bmd_europe |title=Free Article for Non-Members |publisher=Stratfor |date=12 November 2008 |accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref> . 

Sejil-2 is an upgraded version of the Sejil. The Sejil-2 two-stage solid-fuel missile has a 2,000km range and was first test fired on 20 May 2009. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/05/20/iran.missile.test/ |title=Iran tests new surface-to-surface missile |publisher=CNN  |date=20 May 2009 |accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref> The Sejil-2 surface-to-surface medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) was first tested eight months prior to the actual test launch, which took place in the central Iranian province of Semnan. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.presstv.ir/detail/95359.html |title=PressTV – Iran successfully tests Sejjil 2 missile |publisher=Edition.presstv.ir |date=20 May 2009 |accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref> Improvements include better navigation system, better targeting system, more payload, longer range, faster lift-off, longer storage time, quicker launch, and lower detection possibility. <ref>{{cite web|author=msoltan |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lXT4NgviL0&fmt=18 |title=Iran Successfully Tests Sejjil-2 Missile |publisher=YouTube |date=20 May 2009 |accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref> .

===Aircraft===. 
{{Main|Iranian Air Force}}
Any aircraft could potentially be used to host some form of WMD distribution system. Iran has a varied air force with planes purchased from many countries, including the United States. Due to sanctions, the Iranian government has encouraged production of domestically manufactured planes and, since 2002, has built its own transport aircraft, fighters, and gunship helicopters.  .
