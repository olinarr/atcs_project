{{nuclear weapons}} . 

'''Nuclear strategy''' involves the development of [[military doctrine|doctrine]]s and [[strategy|strategies]] for the production and use of [[nuclear weapon]]s.  . 

As a sub-branch of [[military strategy]], nuclear strategy attempts to match nuclear weapons as means to political ends. In addition to the actual use of nuclear weapons whether in the battlefield or strategically, a large part of nuclear strategy involves their use as a bargaining tool.  . 

Some of the issues considered within nuclear strategy include: . 

*Under what conditions does it serve a nation's interest to develop nuclear weapons?
*What types of nuclear weapons should be developed?
*When and how should such weapons be used?  . 

Many strategists argue that nuclear strategy differs from other forms of [[military strategy]] because the immense and terrifying power of the weapons makes their use in seeking victory in a traditional military sense impossible.  . 

Perhaps counterintuitively, an important focus of nuclear strategy has been determining how to prevent and deter their use, a crucial part of [[mutual assured destruction]].  . 

In the context of [[nuclear proliferation]] and maintaining the balance of power, states also seek to prevent other states from acquiring nuclear weapons as part of nuclear strategy.  .
