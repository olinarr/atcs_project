The '''stability-instability paradox''' is an [[international relations theory]] regarding the effect of [[nuclear weapons]] and [[mutually assured destruction]]. It states that when two countries each have nuclear weapons, the probability of a direct war between them greatly decreases, but the probability of minor or indirect conflicts between them increases. This occurs because rational actors want to avoid nuclear wars, and thus they neither start major conflicts nor allow minor conflicts to escalate into major conflictsâ€”thus making it safe to engage in minor conflicts. For instance, during the [[Cold War]] the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] never engaged each other in warfare, but fought [[proxy wars]] in [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Afghanistan]] and spent substantial amounts of money and manpower on gaining relative influence over the [[third world]]. <ref> Krepon, Michael. "The Stability-Instability Paradox, Misperception,
and Escalation Control in South Asia" May 2003, The Henry Stimson Center. http://www.stimson.org/southasia/pdf/kreponmay03.pdf</ref> . 

More recently this effect can be seen in the India-Pakistan relationship.  . 

Thus, nuclear weapons have the potential to cause both stability and instability.  .
