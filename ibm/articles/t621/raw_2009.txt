[[Image:Original Geneva Conventions.jpg|thumb|The Geneva Convention: the signature-and-seals page of the [[First Geneva Convention]] (1864), establishing humane rules of war]] . 

The '''Geneva Conventions''' comprise four [[Treaty|treaties]], and three additional [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocols]], that establish the standards of [[international law]] for the [[humanitarian]] treatment of the victims of [[war]]. The singular term ''Geneva Convention'' denotes the agreements of 1949, negotiated in the aftermath of the [[World War II|Second World War]] (1939–45), which updated the terms of the first three treaties (1864, 1906, 1929), and added a fourth treaty. The articles of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] (1949) extensively defined the basic rights of prisoners (civil and military) during war; established protections for the wounded; and established protections for the civilians in and around a war zone. The treaties of 1949 were ratified, in whole or with [[Reservation (law)|reservations]], [[List of parties to the Geneva Conventions|by 194 countries]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebSign?ReadForm&id=375&ps=P|work=International Humanitarian Law|title=State Parties / Signatories: Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949|publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross|accessdate=2007-01-22}}</ref> The Geneva Convention also defines the rights and protections of non-combatants.  . 

Moreover, because the Geneva Conventions are about people in war, the articles do not address [[warfare]] proper — the use of [[weapon]]s of war — which is the subject of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]] (First Hague Conference, 1899; Second Hague Conference 1907), and the [[biological warfare|bio]]–[[chemical warfare|chemical]] warfare [[Geneva Protocol]] (Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare,&nbsp;1929).  . 

==History==. 
[[File:Herter - In the name of mercy give.jpg|thumb|200px|World War I Red Cross Poster]]
In 1862, [[Henry Dunant]] published his book, ''Memoir of Solferino'', on the horrors of war. <ref>{{cite book | last = Dunant | first = Henry | title = A Memory of Solferino | url = http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/publication/p0361.htm }} English version, full text online. </ref> His wartime experiences inspired Dunant to propose:
# a permanent relief agency for humanitarian aid in times of war, and
# a [[government]] treaty recognizing the neutrality of the agency and allowing it to provide aid in a war zone. 
The former proposal led to the establishment of the [[Red Cross]] in [[Geneva]]. The latter led to the First Geneva Convention. For both of these accomplishments, Henry Dunant became corecipient of the first [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1901. <ref>{{cite book | last = Abrams | first = Irwin | title = The Nobel Peace Prize and the Laureates: An Illustrated Biographical History, 1901-2001 | publisher = Science History Publications | location = US | year = 2001 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=ny77bPwKxaUC | accessdate = 2009-07-14}}</ref><ref>[http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/f00993 The story of an idea], film on the creation of the Red Cross, Red Crescent Movement and the Geneva Conventions</ref> . 

The ten articles of this first treaty were initially adopted on August 22, 1864 by twelve nations. <ref>{{cite book | last = Roxburgh | first = Ronald | title = International Law: A Treatise | publisher = Longmans, Green and co. | location = London | year = 1920 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=G8NAAAAAIAAJ | accessdate = 2009-07-14 | page = 707}} The original twelve original countries were [[Switzerland]], [[Baden]], [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Hesse]], [[Holland]], [[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Prussia]], [[Spain]], and [[Wurtemburg]]. </ref> [[Clara Barton]] was instrumental in campaigning for the ratification of the First Geneva Convention by the [[United States]], which eventually ratified it in 1882. <ref>{{cite book | last = Burton | first = David | title = Clara Barton: in the service of humanity | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group | location = London | year = 1995 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=rJyTkPqIC-sC | accessdate = 2009-07-14}}</ref> . 

The second treaty was first adopted in the ''Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armies at Sea'', concluded on July 6, 1906 and specifically addressed members of the Armed Forces at sea. <ref>[http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1907/15 Text of the 1906 convention (French)]</ref> It was continued in the ''Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War'', concluded on July 27, 1929 and entered into effect on June 19, 1931. <ref>Text in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 118, pp. 304-341. </ref> Inspired by the wave of humanitarian and pacifistic enthusiasm following [[World War II]] and the outrage towards the [[war crimes]] disclosed by the [[Nuremberg Trials]], a series of conferences were held in 1949 reaffirming, expanding and updating the prior three Geneva Conventions and adding a new elaborate ''Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War''.  . 

Despite the length of these documents, they were found over time to be incomplete. In fact, the very nature of [[war|armed conflicts]] had changed with the beginning of the [[Cold War]] era, leading many to believe that the 1949 Geneva Conventions were addressing a largely extinct reality<ref>{{cite book | last = Kolb| first = Robert| title = Ius in bello| publisher = Helbing Lichtenhahn | location = Basel | year = 2009 | code=[ISBN 978-2-8027-2848-1]}}</ref>: on the one hand, most armed conflicts had become internal, or civil wars, while on the other, most wars had become increasingly [[asymmetric warfare|asymmetric]]. Moreover, modern armed conflicts were inflicting an increasingly higher toll on [[civilians]], which brought the need to provide civilian persons and objects with tangible protections in time of combat, thus bringing a much needed update to the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]] of 1899 and 1907. In light of these developments, two Protocols were adopted in 1977 that extended the terms of the 1949 Conventions with additional protections. In 2005, a third brief Protocol was added establishing an additional [[protective sign]] for medical services, the Red Crystal, as an alternative to the ubiquitous [[Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross and Red Crescent]] emblems, for those countries that find them objectionable.  . 

==The conventions and their agreements==. 
The Geneva Conventions are rules that apply in times of armed conflict and seek to protect people who are not or are no longer taking part in hostilities, these include the sick and wounded of armed forces on the field, wounded,sick and shipwrecked members of armed forces at sea, prisoners of war,and civilians.The first convention dealt with the treatment of wounded and sick and occured largely because of the motivations of Henri Dunant, after he saw and published a book about the inadequete treatment of wounded and sick men at the battlefield of Solferino. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Sperry|first=C.|title=The Revision of the Geneva Convention, 1906.|journal=Proceedings of the American Political Science Association|year=1906|volume=3|pages=33-57|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3038537?&Search=yes&searchText=revision&searchText=geneva&searchText=convention%2C&searchText=1906&list=hide&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dthe%2Brevision%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bgeneva%2Bconvention%252C%2B1906%26acc%3Don%26wc%3Don&prevSearch=&item=1&ttl=1076&returnArticleService=showFullText|accessdate=2/15/2012}}</ref> The second convention was proposed to add aid to sick, wounded, and shipwrecked members of armed forces at sea. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Yingling|first=Raymund|title=The Geneva Conventions of 1949|journal=The American Journal of International Law|year=1952|volume=46|pages=393-427|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2194498?&Search=yes&searchText=1949&searchText=conventions&searchText=geneva&list=hide&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dthe%2Bgeneva%2Bconventions%2Bof%2B1949%26gw%3Djtx%26acc%3Don%26prq%3Dthe%2Bgeneva%2Bconvention%2Bof%2B1949%26Search%3DSearch%26hp%3D25%26wc%3Don&prevSearch=&item=5&ttl=4892&returnArticleService=showFullText|accessdate=2/16/2012}}</ref> The Third convention dealt with the treatment of prisoners of war during times of conflict, the conflict in Vietnam highly contributed to this revision of the Geneva Convention. <ref>{{cite journal|title=The Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War|journal=The American Journal of International Law|year=1953|volume=47|pages=119-117|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2213912?&Search=yes&searchText=geneva&searchText=convention&searchText=relative&list=hide&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dthe%2Bgeneva%2Bconvention%2Brelative%26acc%3Don%26wc%3Don&prevSearch=&item=4&ttl=9113&returnArticleService=showFullText|accessdate=2/9/2012)}}</ref> The fourth Geneva convention dealt with the treatment of civilians and their protection during wartime. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Bugnion|first=Francios|title=The Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949: From the 1949 Diplomatic Conference to the Dawn of the New Millenium|journal=International Affairs (Royal Institute of International Affairs 1944-)|year=2000|volume=76|pages=41-51|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2626195?&Search=yes&searchText=1949&searchText=geneva&searchText=august&searchText=convention&searchText=12&list=hide&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dgeneva%2Bconvention%2Bof%2B12%2Baugust%2B1949%26gw%3Djtx%26acc%3Don%26prq%3Dgeneva%2Bcnvention%2Bof%2B12%2Baugust%2B1949%26Search%3DSearch%26hp%3D25%26wc%3Don&prevSearch=&item=1&ttl=3902&returnArticleService=showFullText|accessdate=2/15/2012}}</ref> . 

===Conventions===. 
In diplomacy, the term ''convention'' does not have its common meaning as an assembly of people. Rather, it is used in diplomacy to mean ''an international agreement,'' or treaty. The first three Geneva Conventions were revised and expanded in 1949, and the fourth was added at that time. 
* [[First Geneva Convention]] for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, 1864
* [[Second Geneva Convention]] for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, 1906
* [[Third Geneva Convention]] relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, 1929
* [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, 1949 . 

The whole set is referred to as the "Geneva Conventions of 1949" or simply the "Geneva Convention".  . 

===Protocols===. 
The 1949 conventions have been modified with three amendment [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocols]]:
* [[Protocol I]] (1977) relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts
* [[Protocol II]] (1977) relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts
* [[Protocol III]] (2005) relating to the Adoption of an Additional Distinctive Emblem.  . 

==Application==. 
The Geneva Conventions apply at times of war and armed conflict to governments who have ratified its terms. The details of applicability are spelled out in Common Articles 2 and 3. The topic of applicability has generated some controversy. When the Geneva Conventions apply, governments have surrendered some of their national [[sovereignty]] by signing these treaties.  . 

===Common Article 2 relating to International Armed Conflicts===. 
This article states that the Geneva Conventions apply to all cases of ''international'' conflict, where at least one of the warring nations have ratified the Conventions. Primarily: . 

* The Conventions apply to all cases of [[Declaration of war|declared war]] between signatory nations. This is the original sense of applicability, which predates the 1949 version. 
* The Conventions apply to all cases of armed conflict between two or more signatory nations, even in the absence of a declaration of war. This language was added in 1949 to accommodate situations that have all the characteristics of war without the existence of a formal declaration of war, such as a [[police action]]. <ref name=pictet>{{cite book | last = Pictet | first = Jean | title = Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949: Commentary  | publisher = International Committee of the Red Cross | year = 1958 | url = http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/Geneva_conventions-1949.html | accessdate = 2009-07-15}}</ref>
* The Conventions apply to a signatory nation even if the opposing nation is not a signatory, but only if the opposing nation "accepts and applies the provisions" of the Conventions. <ref name=pictet/> . 

Article 1 of [[Protocol I]] further clarifies that armed conflict against colonial domination and foreign occupation also qualifies as an ''international'' conflict.  . 

When the criteria of international conflict have been met, the full protections of the Conventions are considered to apply.  . 

===Common Article 3 relating to Non-International Armed Conflict===. 
This article states that the certain minimum [[rules of war]] apply to [[armed conflicts]] that are not of an international character, but that are contained within the boundaries of a single country. The applicability of this article rests on the interpretation of the term ''[[armed conflict]]''. <ref name=pictet/> For example it would apply to conflicts between the Government and rebel forces, or between two rebel forces, or to other conflicts that have all the characteristics of war but that are carried out within the confines of a single country. A handful of individuals attacking a police station would not be considered an armed conflict subject to this article, but only subject to the laws of the country in question. <ref name=pictet/> . 

The other Geneva Conventions are not applicable in this situation but only the provisions contained within Article 3,<ref name=pictet/> and additionally within the language of [[Protocol II]]. The rationale for the limitation is to avoid conflict with the rights of [[Sovereign State]]s that were not part of the treaties. When the provisions of this article apply, it states that:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/file/Legal%20Library/jud_supplement/supp6-e/tadic.htm | title = Article 3 of the Convention (III) relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War. Geneva, 12 August 1949. | publisher = Inter national Committee of the Red Cross|accessdate=2011-01-11}}</ref>
* Persons taking no active part in [[hostilities]], including military persons who have ceased to be active as a result of sickness, injury, or detention, should be treated humanely and that the following acts are prohibited:
** violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture;
** taking of hostages;
** outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment; and
** the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples. 
* The wounded and sick shall be collected and cared for.  . 

==Enforcement== . 

===Enforcement authority of the United Nations Security Council===. 
The final international tribunal for all issues related to the Geneva Conventions and other treaties is the [[United Nations Security Council]].  As a [[charter]], the [[UN Charter]] is a constituent treaty, and all members are bound by its articles. The [[UN Charter]]'s Article 25 and others<ref>http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/preamble.shtml</ref> require that obligations to the United Nations prevail over all other treaty obligations. The UNSC rarely invokes its authority regarding the Geneva Conventions and so most issues are resolved by regional treaties or by national law.  . 

===Protecting powers=== . 

The term ''protecting power'' has a specific meaning under these Conventions. A protecting power is a state that is not taking part in the armed conflict, but that has agreed to look after the interests of a state that is a party to the conflict. The protecting power is a mediator enabling the flow of communication between the parties to the conflict. The protecting power also monitors implementation of these Conventions, such as by visiting the zone of conflict and prisoners of war. The protecting power must act as an advocate for prisoners, the wounded, and civilians.  . 

=== Grave breaches ===. 
[[File:International Criminal Court logo.svg|thumb|left|Logo of [[International Criminal Court]]]]
Not all violations of the treaty are treated equally. The most serious crimes are termed ''grave breaches,'' and provide a legal definition of a [[war crime]]. Grave breaches of the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions include the following acts if committed against a person protected by the convention: . 

* willful killing, torture or inhumane treatment, including biological experiments
* willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health
* compelling someone to serve in the forces of a hostile power
* willfully depriving someone of the [[right to a fair trial]] if accused of a war crime.  . 

Also considered grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention are the following: . 

* taking of hostages
* extensive destruction and appropriation of property not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly
* unlawful deportation, transfer, or confinement. <ref name=icrc>[http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/5ZMGF9 How "grave breaches" are defined in the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols], International Committee of the Red Cross. </ref> . 

Nations who are party to these treaties must enact and enforce legislation penalizing any of these crimes. <ref>For example, the [[War Crimes Act of 1996]]. </ref> Nations are also obligated to search for persons alleged to commit these crimes, or [[Command responsibility|ordered them to be committed]], and to bring them to trial regardless of their nationality and regardless of the place where the crimes took place.  . 

The principle of [[universal jurisdiction]] also applies to the enforcement of grave breaches when the [[UN Security Council]] asserts its [[authority]] and [[jurisdiction]] from the [[UN Charter]] to apply universal jurisdiction. The [[UNSC]] did this via the [[International Criminal Court]] when they established the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] to investigate and/or prosecute alleged violations.  . 

== The Geneva Conventions today == . 

Although warfare has changed dramatically since the Geneva Conventions of 1949, they are still considered the cornerstone of contemporary International Humanitarian Law. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/geneva-conventions-statement-090709 | title = The Geneva Conventions Today | publisher = International Committee of the Red Cross|accessdate=2009-11-16}}</ref> They protect combatants who find themselves ''[[hors de combat]],'' and they protect civilians caught up in the zone of war. These treaties came into play for all recent international armed conflicts, including the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)]]<ref>See U.S. Supreme Court decision, [[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]</ref>, the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], the invasion of Chechnya (1994–present)<ref>{{cite journal |last=Abresch |first=William |title=A Human Rights Law of Internal Armed Conflict: The European Court of Human Rights in Chechnya |journal=European Journal of International Law |volume=16 |issue=4 |year=2005 |url=http://www.ejil.org/pdfs/16/4/316.pdf}}</ref>, and the [[2008 War in Georgia]].  . 

Modern warfare continues to evolve, and the lines between combatants and civilians have blurred. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/geneva-convention-statement-091109?opendocument | title = Sixty years of the Geneva Conventions and the decades ahead | publisher = International Committee of the Red Cross|accessdate=2009-11-16}}</ref> (for instance, the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]], the [[Second Sudanese Civil War|Sudanese Civil War]], and the [[Colombian Armed Conflict]]). Common Article 3 deals with these situations,
supplemented by Protocol II (1977). These set out minimum legal standards that must be followed for internal conflicts. International tribunals, particularly the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]], have helped to clarify international law in this area. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/file/Legal%20Library/jud_supplement/supp6-e/tadic.htm | title = The Prosecutor v. Dusko Tadic - Case No. IT-94-1-A | publisher = International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia|accessdate=2009-11-16}}</ref> In the 1999 ''Prosecutor v. [[Dusko Tadic]]'' judgement, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia ruled that grave breaches apply not only to international conflicts, but also to internal armed conflict.{{dubious|date=November 2011}} Further, those provisions are considered [[customary international law]], allowing war crimes prosecution by the [[United Nations]] and its [[International Court of Justice]] over groups that have signed and have not signed the Geneva Conventions.  .
