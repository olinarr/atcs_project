{{Anti-nuclear movement}}
The '''Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament''' (CND) is an [[anti-nuclear]] organisation that advocates unilateral [[nuclear disarmament]] by the [[United Kingdom]], international nuclear disarmament and tighter international arms regulation through agreements such as the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]]. It opposes military action that may result in the use of [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]], [[Chemical warfare|chemical]] or [[Biological warfare|biological weapons]] and the building of [[nuclear power]] stations in the UK.  . 

CND was formed in 1957 and since that time has periodically been at the forefront of the [[peace movement]] in the UK. It claims to be [[Europe]]'s largest [[Single-issue politics|single-issue peace campaign]]. Since 1959, it has organised the [[Aldermaston Marches|Aldermaston March]], which is held over the [[Easter]] weekend from the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment]] near [[Aldermaston]] to [[Trafalgar Square]], [[London]]. The first Aldermaston March in 1958 went the other way (from London to Aldermaston) and was organised by the Direct Action Committee.  . 

The Campaign's [[General Secretary]] is [[Kate Hudson (activist)|Kate Hudson]].  . 

==Campaigns==. 
CND's current strategic objectives are:
* The elimination of British nuclear weapons and global abolition of nuclear weapons. It campaigns for the cancellation of Trident by the British government and against the deployment of nuclear weapons in Britain. 
* The abolition of [[weapons of mass destruction]], in particular chemical and biological weapons. CND wants a ban on the manufacture, testing and use of depleted [[uranium]] weapons
* A nuclear-free, less militarised and more secure Europe. It supports the [[Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE). It opposes US military bases and nuclear weapons in Europe and British membership of NATO. 
* The closure of the [[nuclear power]] industry. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnduk.org/index.php/about/general/about-cnd.html |title=CND aims and policies |publisher=Cnduk.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref> . 

In recent years CND has extended its campaigns to include opposition to U.S. and British policy in the [[Middle East]], rather as it broadened its anti-nuclear campaigns in the 1960s to include opposition to the Vietnam War. In collaboration with the [[Stop the War Coalition]] and the [[Muslim Association of Britain]], CND has organised [[Protests against the 2003 Iraq war|anti-war marches]] under the slogan "[[Don't Attack Iraq]]", including protests on September 28, 2002 and [[February 15, 2003 anti-war protest|February 15, 2003]]. It also  organised a vigil for the victims of the [[2005 London bombings]].  . 

CND campaigns against the [[Trident missile]]. In March 2007 it organised a rally in Parliament Square to coincide with the Commons motion to renew the weapons system. The rally was attended by over 1,000 people. It was addressed by Labour MPs [[Jon Trickett]], [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53ZdD_WL6g [[Emily Thornberry]]], [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqiOmkWTCmw [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]]], [[Michael Meacher]], [[Diane Abbott]] and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRMHcp4zkGU [[Jeremy Corbyn]]], and [[Elfyn Llwyd]] of [[Plaid Cymru]] and [[Angus MacNeil]] of the [[Scottish National Party]]. In the House of Commons, 161 MPs (88 of them Labour) voted against the renewal of Trident and the Government motion was carried only with the support of Conservatives. <ref>http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-03038.pdf</ref> . 

In 2006 CND launched a campaign against nuclear power. Its membership, which had fallen to 32,000 from a peak of 110,000 in 1983, increased threefold after Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] made a commitment to nuclear energy. <ref name=Independent>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cnd-membership-booms-after-nuclear-uturn-408265.html |title=CND membership booms after nuclear U-turn |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=2006-07-17 |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref> . 

==Structure==. 
CND has a national organisation based in London, national groups in Wales, Ireland and [[Scottish CND|Scotland]], regional groups in Cambridgeshire, Cumbria, the East Midlands, Kent, London, Manchester, Merseyside, Mid Somerset, Norwich, South Cheshire and North Staffordshire, Southern England, South West England, Suffolk, Surrey, Sussex, Tyne and Wear, the West Midlands and [http://www.yorkshirecnd.org.uk Yorkshire], and local branches.  . 

There are four "specialist sections": Trade Union CND, [[Christian CND]], [[Labour CND]] and Ex-Services CND,<ref name=constitution>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnduk.org/images/stories/cnd_docs/cnd_constitution.pdf |title=CND Constitution |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref> which have rights of representation on the governing council. There are also parliamentary, youth and student groups.  . 

The Council is made up of the chair of CND, the treasurer, three vice-chairs, 15 directly elected members, a representative of each of the specialist sections, one from Student CND, three from Youth CND and 27 from the regional groups. Employees sit on the Council but do not vote. <ref name=constitution/> . 

==History==. 
===The First Wave 1958-1963===. 
[[File:Semaphore Delta November.svg|thumb|The [[flag semaphore]] symbols for letters "N" (green) and "D" (blue)]]
On 2 November 1957, the ''[[New Statesman]]'' magazine published an article by [[J. B. Priestley]] on "Britain and the Nuclear Bombs", which was critical of [[Aneurin Bevan]] for changing his mind about nuclear weapons and ceasing to advocate [[unilateral nuclear disarmament]] by Britain. The journal received many letters of support, reflecting the growth in opposition to nuclear weapons following Britain's recent [[Operation Grapple|H-bomb tests]].  At the end of November, a meeting was held in the rooms of [[Canon John Collins]], chaired by the editor of the ''New Statesman'', [[Kingsley Martin]], to launch the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Collins was chosen as its Chairman, [[Bertrand Russell]] as its President and [[Peggy Duff]] as its organising secretary. The other members of its executive committee were [[Peter Ritchie Calder|Ritchie Calder]], journalist [[James Cameron (journalist)|James Cameron]], Howard Davies, [[Michael Foot]], [[Arthur Goss]], [[Kingsley Martin]], [[J. B. Priestley]] and [[Joseph Rotblat]].  . 

CND held an inaugural public meeting at [[Central Hall, Westminster]], on 17 February 1958, attended by five thousand people. After the meeting a few hundred left to demonstrate at [[Downing Street]]. <ref name=Minnion>John Minnion and Philip Bolsover (eds.)

Its sponsors included [[John Arlott]], [[Peggy Ashcroft]], the Bishop of Birmingham [[Dr J. L. Wilson]], [[Benjamin Britten]], Viscount Chaplin, [[Michael de la Bédoyère]], Bob Edwards, MP, Dame [[Edith Evans]], A.S.Frere, [[Gerald Gardiner]], QC, [[Victor Gollancz]], Dr I.Grunfeld, [[E.M.Forster]], [[Barbara Hepworth]],  [[Patrick Heron]], Rev.

Organisations that had previously opposed British nuclear weapons supported CND, including the [[British Peace Committee]], the [[Direct Action Committee]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnduk.org/pages/binfo/hist.html |title=The history of CND |publisher=Cnduk.org |date=1945-08-06 |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref> the [[National Committee for the Abolition of Nuclear Weapons Tests]]<ref name=Driver/> and the [[Society of Friends|Quakers]]. <ref name=Parkin/> In the same year, a branch of CND was also set in the [[Republic of Ireland]] by
[[John de Courcy Ireland]], and his wife Beatrice, aiming to campaign for the Irish government to support international efforts to achieve nuclear disarmament and to keep Ireland free of nuclear power. <ref>Fagan, Kieran (April 09 2006).

Notable supporters of the Irish CND included [[Peadar O'Donnell]], [[Owen Sheehy-Skeffington]] and [[Hubert Butler]]. <ref>Richard S. Harrison, ''Irish Anti-War Movements''.  Dublin : Irish Peace 1986 (p.59-61) . </ref> . 

CND's declared policies were the unconditional renunciation of the use, production of or dependence upon nuclear weapons by Britain and the bringing about of a general disarmament convention.  In the meantime, Britain should halt the flight of planes armed with nuclear weapons, end nuclear testing, not proceed with missile bases and not provide nuclear weapons to any other country. <ref name=Driver/> . 

The symbol adopted by CND was designed in 1958 by [[Gerald Holtom]]<ref name=Driver/> and in the following decade became an international [[peace symbol]]. It is based on the [[flag semaphore|semaphore]] symbols for "N" (two flags held 45 degrees down on both sides, forming the triangle at the bottom) and "D" (two flags, one above the head and one at the feet, forming the vertical line) (for Nuclear Disarmament) within a circle. Holtom later said that it also represented "an individual in despair, with hands palm outstretched outwards and downwards in the manner of [[The Third of May 1808|Goya's peasant before the firing squad]]."<ref>[http://www.cnduk.org/pages/ed/cnd_sym.html CND website]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref> . 

In Easter 1958, a 52-mile [[Aldermaston marches|march]] from London to the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment|Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] at [[Aldermaston]] was organised by the Direct Action Committee, supported by CND after some initial reluctance. The march was the subject of a documentary by [[Lindsay Anderson]], [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/533592/ ''March to Aldermaston'']. Thereafter, CND organised annual Easter marches starting at Aldermaston and ending in London. 60,000 people participated in the 1959 march and 150,000 in the 1961 and 1962 marches. <ref>Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, ''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations'', Continuum International Publishing, 2005.

CND supporters were generally left of centre in politics.  About three-quarters of CND supporters were Labour voters<ref name=Parkin>Frank Parkin, ''Middle Class Radicalism: The Social Bases of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament'', Manchester University Press, 1968, p.39</ref> and many of the early executive committee were Labour Party members. <ref name=Driver/>  Its founders envisaged CND as a campaign by eminent individuals who would work through the Labour Party and lobby government for a change in defence policy.  The Labour Party voted at its 1960 Conference for unilateral nuclear disarmament, representing CND's greatest influence on national politics and coinciding with the highest level of public support for its policy of unilateralism. <ref name=carter>April Carter, ''Direct Action and Liberal Democracy'', London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1973, p.64</ref>  [[Hugh Gaitskell]], the Labour Party leader, received the vote with a promise to "fight, fight, and fight again" against the decision and it was overturned at the 1961 Conference.  Labour's failure to win the [[General election of 1959]] and its rejection of unilateralism in 1961 upset the plans of the CND leadership and, although CND retained the support of a significant minority of the population, from this point onwards its prospects of success began to fade.  . 

CND rapidly became a mass movement and attendance at CND demonstrations increased until about 1963.  A network of autonomous branches and specialist groups (such as [[Christian CND]]) sprang up{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. The Aldermaston march, the CND symbol and its slogan "Ban the Bomb" became icons and part of the youth culture of the 1960s.  The different conceptions of CND - campaign by eminent individuals or mass movement - caused friction between leaders and supporters. Until the formation of a national council in 1961, supporters and local groups had no formal voice in the national organisation, which until then had been led by the self-appointed executive committee.  . 

In 1960 Bertrand Russell resigned from the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in order to form the [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)|Committee of 100]], which became, in effect, the direct action wing of CND. Russell argued that direct action was necessary because the press was losing interest in CND and because the danger of nuclear war was so great that it was necessary to obstruct government preparations for it. <ref>Russell, B., "Civil Disobedience", ''New Statesman'', 17 February 1961</ref>  In 1958 CND had cautiously accepted direct action as a possible method of campaigning,<ref name=Driver/> but, largely under the influence of [[Canon John Collins]], the CND chairman, the CND leadership opposed any sort of unlawful protest. The Committee of 100 was created as a separate organisation partly for that reason and partly because of personal animosity between Collins and Russell.  Although the Committee was supported by many in CND, it has been suggested<ref name=Taylor>Taylor, R., ''Against the Bomb'', Oxford University Press, 1988</ref> that the campaign against nuclear weapons was weakened by the friction between the two organisations. The Committee organised large sit-down demonstrations in London and at military bases. It later became involved in other political campaigns, including [[Biafra]], the [[Vietnam war]] and housing in the UK. It was dissolved in 1968. When direct action came to the fore again in the 1980s, it was generally accepted by the peace movement as a normal part of protest. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnduk.org/pages/binfo/hist.html |title=A brief history of CND |publisher=Cnduk.org |date=1945-08-06 |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref> . 

On the 1963 Aldermaston march, a clandestine group calling itself [[Spies for Peace]] distributed leaflets about a secret government establishment, [[Regional Seat of Government|RSG 6]], that the march was passing. The leaflet said that RSG 6 was to be the local HQ for a military dictatorship after nuclear war. A large group left the march, much against the wishes of the CND leadership, to demonstrate at RSG 6.  Later, when the march reached London, there were disorderly demonstrations in which [[anarchism|anarchists]] were prominent, quickly deprecated in the press and in parliament. <ref name=Driver/>  In 1964 there was only a one-day march, partly because of the events of 1963 and partly because the logistics of the march, which had grown beyond all expectation, had exhausted the organisers. <ref name=Minnion/>  The Aldermaston March was resumed in 1965.  . 

The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in the Autumn of 1962, in which the United States blockaded a Soviet attempt to put nuclear missiles on Cuba, created some anxiety about the possibility of imminent nuclear war and CND organised demonstrations on the issue. But six months after the crisis, a [[Gallup Poll]] found that public worry about nuclear weapons had fallen back to its lowest point since 1957,<ref name=Driver/> and there was a view, disputed by CND supporters,<ref>Nigel Young, "Cuba '62", in Minnion and Bolsover, p61</ref> that U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s success in facing down Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] turned the British public away from CND.  . 

John Collins helped to form the [[International Confederation for Disarmament and Peace]] in 1963<ref>[http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/the-oxford-conference-of-non-aligned-peace-organizations Oxford Conference of Non-aligned Peace Organizations]</ref> and resigned as chairman of CND in 1964. He had been unpopular with many CND supporters and he found himself out of sympathy with the direction the movement was taking.  . 

Support for CND dwindled after the 1963 [[Partial Test Ban Treaty|Test Ban Treaty]]. From the mid-1960s, the anti-war movement's preoccupation with the [[Vietnam War]] tended to eclipse concern about nuclear weapons but CND continued to campaign against them.  . 

CND has never allied itself to any political party and has never sought to form itself into an election campaigning body. However, several CND members and supporters have stood for election at various times as Independent Nuclear Disarmament candidates. The nearest CND has come to having an electoral arm was the Independent Nuclear Disarmament Election Campaign (INDEC) which stood candidates in a few local elections during the 1960s. Although never formally endorsed by CND nationally, INDEC candidates were generally put up by local CND groups as a means of raising the profile of this issue in public politics.  . 

===The Second Wave 1980-89===. 
In the 1980s, CND underwent a major revival, its membership increasing from 4,000 to 100,000 between 1979 and 1984.  This was a response to increasing tension between the superpowers following the deployment of American [[Pershing II|Pershing]] [[medium-range ballistic missile|missiles]] in Western Europe, [[RT-21M Pioner|SS20s]] in the Soviet Bloc countries and Britain's replacement of the [[UGM-27 Polaris#British Polaris|Polaris]] armed [[submarine]] fleet with [[Trident missile]]s in 1982. The [[NATO]] exercise [[Able Archer 83]] also added to international tension. CND attracted supporters who opposed the Government’s civil defence plans as outlined in an official booklet, ''[[Protect and Survive]]''. This publication was ridiculed in a popular pamphlet, ''Protest and Survive'', by [[E.P.Thompson]], a leading anti-nuclear campaigner of the period. Public support for unilateralism reached its highest level since the 1960s. <ref name=Caedel>Caedel, Martin, "Britain's Nuclear Disarmers", in Laqueur, W., ''European Peace Movements and the Future of the Western Alliance'', Transaction Publishers, 1985, p.233 ISBN 0-88-738-0352</ref>  More women than men supported it. <ref name=Minnion/> . 

At its 1982 conference, the Labour Party adopted a policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament.  It lost the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]] "in which, following the [[Falklands war]], foreign policy was high on the agenda. Election defeats under, first, Michael Foot, then Neil Kinnock, led Labour to abandon the policy in the late 1980s."<ref>[http://www.antiwarresearch.info/cases.php  Anti-war Activism in the Information Age]</ref> . 

The British anti-nuclear movement at this time differed from the movement of the 1960s. Many groups sprang up independently of CND, some affiliating later. CND's previous objection to civil disobedience was dropped and it became a normal part of anti-nuclear protest. The women's movement had a strong influence, much of it emanating from the [[Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp]]. <ref name=Minnion/> . 

New CND sections were formed, including Ex-services CND, Green CND, Student CND, Tories Against Cruise and Trident (TACT), Trade Union CND, and Youth CND. A network of protesters, calling itself Cruise Watch, tracked and harassed [[Cruise missile]]s whenever they were carried on public roads. After a while, the missiles traveled only at night under police escort. The peace movement of early 1980s was the largest in modern history. In October 1981, 250,000 people joined an anti-nuclear demonstration in London. In October 1983, three million people took part in simultaneous demonstrations across Europe, 300,000 of them in London. <ref name=Cortright>David Cortright, ''Peace: A History of Movements and Ideas'', Cambridge University Press, 2008 ISBN 0521854024</ref> . 

==Extent of public support for CND policies==. 
As CND did not have a national membership until 1966, the strength of public support in its early days can be estimated only from the numbers of those attending demonstrations or expressing approval in opinion polls. Between 1955 and 1962, between 19% to 33% of people in Britain expressed disapproval of the manufacture of nuclear weapons. <ref name=Snyder>W.P.Snyder, ''The Politics of British Defense Policy, 1945-1962'', Ohio University Press, 1964</ref>   . 

Public support for unilateralism in September 1982 was 31%, falling to 21% in January 1983, but it is hard to say whether this decline was a result of the contemporary propaganda campaign against CND or not. <ref name=Caedel/>  Support for CND fell after the end of the Cold war. It had not succeeded in converting the British public to unilateralism and even after the collapse of the Soviet Union British nuclear weapons still have majority support. <ref name=Caedel/>  "Unilateral disarmament has always been opposed by a majority of the British public, with the level of support for unilateralism remaining steady at around one in four of the population."<ref name=carter/><ref name=byrom>Andy Byrom, "British attitudes on nuclear weapons", ''Journal of Public Affairs'', 7: 71-77, 2007</ref> . 

In 2005, [[MORI]] conducted an opinion poll which asked about attitudes to Trident and the use of nuclear weapons. When asked whether the UK should replace Trident, without being told  of the cost, 44% of respondents said "Yes" and 46% said "No".  When asked the same question and told of the cost, 33% said "Yes" and 54% said "No". <ref name=MORI>[http://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Archive/Polls/greenpeace.pdf ''British Attitudes to Nuclear Weapons'']</ref> . 

When asked  "Would you approve or disapprove of the UK using nuclear weapons against a country we are at war with?"
* 9% would approve if that country does not have nuclear weapons, and 84% would disapprove. 
* 16% would approve if that country has nuclear weapons but has never used them, and 72% would disapprove,
* 53% would approve if that country uses nuclear weapons against the UK, and 37% would disapprove. <ref name=MORI/> . 

CND's policy of opposing American nuclear bases is said to be in tune with public opinion. <ref>James Hinton "Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament", in Roger S.Powers, ''Protest, Power and Change'', Taylor and Francis, 1997. ISBN 0815309139</ref> . 

==Organised opposition to CND==. 
CND's growing support in the 1980s provoked opposition from several sources, including Peace Through Nato, the British Atlantic Committee (which received government funding),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1981/dec/17/british-atlantic-committee-grant |title=Lords Hansard |publisher=Hansard.millbanksystems.com |date=1981-12-17 |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref> Women and Families for Defence (set up by conservative journalist [[Lady Olga Maitland]] to oppose the Greenham Common Peace Camp), the Conservative Party's Campaign for Defence and Multilateral Disarmament, the [[Coalition for Peace through Security]],  the Foreign Affairs Research Institute, and The 61, a private sector intelligence agency.  The British government also took direct steps to counter the influence of CND, [[Secretary of State for Defence]] [[Michael Heseltine]] setting up Defence Secretariat 19 "to explain to the public the facts about the Government's policy on deterrence and multilateral disarmament". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1986/jul/21/section-ds19#S6CV0102P0_19860721_CWA_399 |title=Commons Hansard |publisher=Hansard.millbanksystems.com |date=1986-07-21 |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref> The activities of anti-CND organisations are said to have included research, publication, mobilising public opinion, counter-demonstrations, working within the Churches, smears against CND leaders and spying.  . 

In an article on anti-CND groups, Steve Dorril reported that in 1982 [[Eugene V. Rostow]], Director of the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, became concerned about the growing unilateralist movement.  According to Dorril, Rostow helped to initiate a propaganda exercise in Britain, "aimed at neutralising the efforts of CND. It would take three forms: mobilising public opinion, working within the Churches, and a 'dirty tricks' operation against the peace groups."<ref name=lobster/> . 

One of the groups set up to carry out this work was the Coalition for Peace through Security (CPS), modelled on the US Coalition for Peace through Strength.  The CPS was founded in 1981. Its main activists were [[Julian Lewis]], [[Edward Leigh]] and Francis Holihan. <ref name=lobster/>   . 

Amongst the activities of the CPS were commissioning Gallup polls<ref>http://www.julianlewis.net/press_detail.php?id=36</ref> which showed the levels of support for British possession of nuclear weapons, providing speakers at public meetings, highlighting the [[left-wing]] affiliations of leading CND figures and mounting counter-[[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] against CND.  These including haranguing CND marchers from the roof of its Whitehall offices flying a plane over a CND festival with a banner reading, "Help the Soviets, Support CND!"<ref name=wittner>Wittner, L., ''The Struggle Against the Bomb'', Volume 3, Stanford University Press, 2003</ref>  It also denounced [[Bruce Kent]], the general secretary of CND, as a supporter of IRA terrorism. <ref name=wittner/>  . 

The CPS attracted criticism for refusing to say where its funding came from while alleging that the anti-nuclear movement was funded by the Soviet Union. <ref name="Kent179-181">Bruce Kent, ''Undiscovered Ends'', pp. 179-181. </ref> Although the CPS called itself a grass-roots movement, it had no members and was financed by The 61,<ref name=wittner/> "a private sector operational intelligence agency"<ref>Joseph C.  Goulden, "Crozier, covert acts, CIA and Cold War", ''The Washington Times'', 15 May 1994</ref> said by its founder, [[Brian Crozier]], to be funded by "rich individuals and a few private companies". <ref>Brian Crozier, Letters: Churchill, the CIA and Clinton, ''The Guardian'', 3 August 1998</ref>  It is said to have also received funding from the [[Heritage Foundation]]. <ref name=spinwatch/> . 

Bruce Kent alleged in his autobiography that Francis Holihan spied on CND. It was said that Holihan sent senior clerics in the Catholic Church material on Kent<ref name=lobster/> (Kent was a catholic priest), that Holihan organised the aerial propaganda against CND, that he had entered CND offices under false pretences, and that CPS workers had joined CND in order to gain access to the Campaign's 1982 Annual Conference. <ref name=lobster/> It was said that when Kent went on a speaking tour of America, Holihan followed him, that offensive material on Kent was sent to newspapers and radio stations, and that demonstrations were organised against him. <ref name=lobster>[http://www.8bitmode.com/rogerdog/lobster/lobster03.pdf ''The Lobster'', No.3, 1984]</ref>  . 

Brian Crozier claimed in his book ''Free Agent: The Unseen War 1941-1991'' (Harper Collins, 1993) that The 61 infiltrated a mole into CND in 1979. <ref name=spinwatch/> . 

[[Gerald Vaughan]], a government minister, tried to halve government funding for the [[Citizens Advice Bureau]], apparently because [[Joan Ruddock]], CND's chair, was employed part-time at his local bureau. Bruce Kent was warned by Cardinal [[Basil Hume]] not to become too involved in politics.  . 

CND's opponents claimed that CND was a [[Soviet-run peace movements in the West|Communist or Soviet-dominated organisation]].  In 1981, the Foreign Affairs Research Institute, which shared an office with the CPS, was said by ''Sanity'', the CND newspaper, to have published a booklet claiming that Russian money was being used by CND. <ref name=lobster/>  In response to [[Lord Chalfont]]'s claim in that the Soviet Union was giving the European peace movement £100 million a year, Bruce Kent said, "If they were, it was certainly not getting to our grotty little office in Finsbury Park."<ref>[http://www.cnduk.org/index.php/media/item/812-soviet-funding?-rubbish Hudson, Kate, "Soviet funding? Rubbish", CND website]</ref>  In the 1980s, the [[Federation of Conservative Students]] alleged Soviet funding of CND.  . 

==Intelligence operations against CND==. 
The security service ([[MI5]]) has carried out surveillance of CND members it considered to be subversive. From the late 1960s until the mid-1970s, MI5 designated CND as subversive by virtue of its being "communist controlled". Communists have played an active role in the organisation, and John Cox, its chairman from 1971 to 1977, was a member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]]. <ref name=dmail>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1229940/Cathy-Ashton-EUs-new-Foreign-Minister-Treasurer-CND.html |title=EU's new 'Foreign Minister' Cathy Ashton was Treasurer of CND |publisher=Daily Mail |date=2009-11-22 |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref>  From the late 1970s, MI5 downgraded CND to "communist-penetrated". MI5 says it has no current investigations in this area. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mi5.gov.uk/output/myths-and-misunderstandings.html#8 |title=Myths and Misunderstandings |publisher=Mi5.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref> . 

In 1985, Cathy Massiter, an MI5 officer who had been responsible for the surveillance of CND from 1981 to 1983, resigned and made disclosures to  a [[Channel 4]] ''20/20 Vision'' programme, "MI5's Official Secrets". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/true_spies/2336987.stm |title=Secret State: Timeline |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-10-17 |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref><ref name=hansard>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1986/jul/24/business-of-the-house-1 |title=Dale Campbell-Savours, MP, in '&#39;Hansard'&#39;, 24 July 1986 |publisher=Hansard.millbanksystems.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref>  She said that her work was determined more by the political importance of CND than by any security threat posed by subversive elements within it.  In 1983, she analysed telephone intercepts on John Cox that gave her access to conversations with Joan Ruddock and Bruce Kent. MI5 also placed a spy, Harry Newton, in the CND office. According to Massiter, Newton believed that CND was controlled by extreme left-wing activists and that Bruce Kent might be a crypto-communist, but Massiter found no evidence to support either opinion. <ref>Bateman, D., ''[http://www.lobster-magazine.co.uk/issue28.php  The Trouble With Harry: A memoire of Harry Newton, MI5 agent]'', '''Lobster''', Issue 28, December 1994. Accessed 3 November 2011. </ref> On the basis of Ruddock's contacts, MI5 suspected her of being a communist sympathiser. Speaking in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], [[Dale Campbell-Savours]], MP, said,  . 

<blockquote>"it was felt within the service that officers were likely to be questioned about the true political affiliation of Mrs. Joan Ruddock, who became chair of CND in 1983. It was fully recognised by the service that she had no subversive affiliations and therefore should not be recorded under any of the usual subversive categories. In fact, she was recorded as a contact of a hostile intelligence service after giving an interview to a Soviet journalist based in London who was suspected of being a KGB intelligence officer.  In Joan Ruddock's file, MI5 recorded special branch references to her movements—usually public meetings—and kept press cuttings and the products of mail and telephone intercepts obtained through active investigation of other targets, such as the Communist party and John Cox. There were police reports recording her appearances at demonstrations or public meetings. There were references to her also in reports from agents working, for example, in the Communist party. These would also appear in her file."<ref name=hansard/></blockquote> . 

According to Stephen Dorril, at about the same time, [[Special Branch]] officers recruited an informant within CND, Stanley Bonnett, on the instructions of MI5. <ref name=spinwatch/> MI5 is also said to have suspected CND's treasurer, [[Cathy Ashton]], of being a communist sympathiser<ref name=dmail/> because she shared a house with a communist. <ref name=spinwatch>[www.islamagainstextremism.com/dld.cfm?a=isjeyf Tom Mills, Tom Griffin and David Miller, ''The Cold War on British Muslims'', Spinwatch, 2011]</ref>  When Michael Heseltine became Secretary of State for Defence, Massiter prepared a report on CND for him. She was asked to provide information for Defence Secretariat 19 about leading CND personnel but was instructed to include only information from published sources. Ruddock claims that DS19 released distorted information regarding her political party affiliations to the media and Conservative Party candidates. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdt.org/security/usapatriot/030127mi5.pdf |title=Center for Democracy and Technology, '&#39;Domestic Intelligence Agencies: The Mixed Record of the UK’s MI5'&#39; |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref> . 

In 1990, it was discovered in the archive of the [[Stasi]] (the state security service of the former [[German Democratic Republic]]) that a member of CND's governing council, [[Vic Allen]], had passed information to them about CND. This discovery was made public in a BBC TV programme in 1999, reviving debate about Soviet links to CND. Allen stood against [[Joan Ruddock]] for the leadership of CND in 1985, but was defeated. Ruddock responded to the Stasi revelations with "[Allen] certainly had no influence on national CND, and as a pro-Soviet could never have succeeded to the chair. CND was as opposed to Soviet nuclear weapons as Western ones."<ref>{{cite web|author=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons, Westminster |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmhansrd/vo991221/halltext/91221h04.htm#91221h04_head0 |title=Commons Hansard |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/09/99/britain_betrayed/451366.stm |title=I regret nothing, says Stasi spy  |publisher=BBC News |date=1999-09-20 |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref> .
