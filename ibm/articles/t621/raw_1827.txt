'''Nuclear disarmament''' refers to both the act of reducing or eliminating [[nuclear weapons]] and to the end state of a nuclear-free world, in which nuclear weapons are completely eliminated.  . 

Major [[List of anti-nuclear groups|nuclear disarmament groups]] include [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], [[Greenpeace]] and [[International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War]]. There have been many large anti-nuclear [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] and [[protest]]s. On June 12, 1982, one million people demonstrated in New York City's [[Central Park]] against [[nuclear weapons]] and for an end to the [[cold war]] [[arms race]]. It was the largest anti-nuclear [[Demonstration (people)|protest]] and the largest political demonstration in American history. <ref name="The Spirit of June 12">Jonathan Schell. [http://www.thenation.com/article/spirit-june-12 The Spirit of June 12] ''The Nation'', July 2, 2007. </ref><ref name="icanw.org">[http://www.icanw.org/1982 1982 - a million people march in New York City]</ref> . 

Proponents of nuclear disarmament say that it would lessen the probability of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] occurring, especially accidentally. Critics of nuclear disarmament say that it would undermine [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]].  . 

==History==. 
After the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] (1963), which prohibited atmospheric testing, the movement against nuclear weapons somewhat subsided in the 1970s (and was replaced in part by a [[Anti-nuclear movement|movement against nuclear power]]).  . 

In the 1980s, a popular movement for nuclear disarmament again gained strength in the light of the weapons build-up and aggressive rhetoric of [[US President]] [[Ronald Reagan]]. Reagan had "a world free of nuclear weapons" as his personal mission,<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/07/giulianis-obama-nuke-crit_n_528439.html Giuliani's Obama-Nuke Critique Defies And Ignores Reagan], Huffington Post 04- 7-10</ref><ref name=legacy>[http://www.heritage.org/Research/Lecture/President-Reagans-Legacy-and-US-Nuclear-Weapons-Policy President Reagan's Legacy and U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy], Heritage.org, July 20, 2006</ref><ref name=HS9510/> and was largely scorned for this in Europe. <ref name=HS9510/> His officials tried to stop such talks but Reagan was able to start discussions on nuclear disarmament with [[Soviet Union]]. <ref name=HS9510>"Hyvästi, ydinpommi", [[Helsingin Sanomat]] 2010-09-05, p. D1-D2</ref> He changed the name "SALT" ([[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]]) to "START" ([[Strategic Arms Reduction Talks]]). <ref name=legacy/>  . 

After the 1986 [[Reykjavik summit]] between U.S. President Ronald Reagan and the new Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, the United States and the Soviet Union concluded two  important nuclear arms reduction treaties: the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty|INF Treaty]] (1987) and [[START I]] (1991).  After the end of the Cold War, the United States and the Russian Federation concluded the [[Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty]] (2003) and the [[New START]] Treaty (2010).  . 

In the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR), voices against nuclear weapons were few and far between{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} since there was no widespread [[Freedom of speech]] and [[Freedom of the press]] as political factors. Certain citizens who had become prominent enough to safely criticize the [[Soviet government]], such as [[Andrei Sakharov]], did speak out against nuclear weapons, but that was to little effect.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} . 

When the extreme danger intrinsic to nuclear war and the possession of nuclear weapons became apparent to all sides during the Cold War, a series of disarmament and nonproliferation treaties were agreed upon between the United States, the Soviet Union, and several other states throughout the world. Many of these treaties involved years of negotiations, and seemed to result in important steps in arms reductions and reducing the risk of nuclear war.  . 

'''Key treaties''' . 

*[[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] (PTBT) 1963: Prohibited all testing of nuclear weapons except underground. 
*[[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT)—signed 1968, came into force 1970: An international treaty (currently with 189 member states) to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. The treaty has three main pillars: nonproliferation, disarmament, and the right to peacefully use nuclear technology. 
*[[Strategic_Arms_Limitation_Talks#SALT_I|Interim Agreement on Offensive Arms]] (SALT I) 1972: The Soviet Union and the United States agreed to a freeze in the number of [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs) and [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s (SLBMs) that they would deploy. 
*[[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] (ABM) 1972: The United States and Soviet Union could deploy ABM interceptors at two sites, each with up to 100 ground-based launchers for ABM interceptor missiles. In a 1974 Protocol, the US and Soviet Union agreed to only deploy an ABM system to one site. 
*[[Strategic_Arms_Limitation_Talks#SALT_II|Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty]] (SALT II) 1979: Replacing SALT I, SALT II limited both the Soviet Union and the United States to an equal number of ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, and heavy bombers. Also placed limits on Multiple Independent Reentry Vehicles (MIRVS). 
*[[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]] (INF) 1987: Created a global ban on short- and long-range nuclear weapons systems, as well as an intrusive verification regime. 
*[[START I|Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty]] (START I)—signed 1991, ratified 1994: Limited long-range nuclear forces in the United States and the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union to 6,000 attributed warheads on 1,600 ballistic missiles and bombers. 
*[[START II|Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II]] (START II)—signed 1993, never put into force: START II was a bilateral agreement between the US and Russia which attempted to commit each side to deploy no more than 3,000 to 3,500 warheads by December 2007 and also included a prohibition against deploying multiple independent reentry vehicles (MIRVs) on intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs)
*[[SORT|Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty]] (SORT or Moscow Treaty)—signed 2002, into force 2003: A very loose treaty that is often criticized by arms control advocates for its ambiguity and lack of depth, Russia and the United States agreed to reduce their "strategic nuclear warheads" (a term that remain undefined in the treaty) to between 1,700 and 2,200 by 2012. 
*[[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]] (CTBT)—signed 1996, not yet in force: The CTBT is an international treaty (currently with 181 state signatures and 148 state ratifications) that bans all nuclear explosions in all environments. While the treaty is not in force, Russia has not tested a nuclear weapon since 1990 and the United States has not since 1992. <ref>[http://www.uspw.org/index.php?title=Portal:Nuclear_Disarmament "Nuclear Disarmament," US Policy World.  http://www.uspw.org/]</ref>
*[[START treaty (2010)|New START Treaty]]—signed 2010, into force in 2011: replaces SORT treaty, reduces deployed nuclear warheads by about half, will remain into force until at least 2021
Only one country has been known to ever dismantle their nuclear arsenal completely&mdash;the [[apartheid]] government of [[South Africa]] apparently developed half a dozen crude [[fission weapon]]s during the 1980s, but they were dismantled in the early 1990s.  .

In 1954 Japanese peace movements converged to form a unified "Japanese Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs". Japanese opposition to the Pacific nuclear weapons tests was widespread, and "an estimated 35 million signatures were collected on petitions calling for bans on nuclear weapons". <ref name=falkj>Jim Falk (1982).

==US nuclear policy==. 
Despite a general trend toward disarmament in the early 1990s, the [[George W. Bush administration]] repeatedly pushed to fund policies that would allegedly make nuclear weapons more usable in the post–Cold War environment [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/nov/30/usa.georgebush], [http://www.slate.com/id/2099425/]. To date the [[US Congress|U.S. Congress]] has refused to fund many of these policies. However, some [http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0709-06.htm] feel that even considering such programs harms the credibility of the United States as a proponent of nonproliferation.  . 

''Recent controversial U.S. nuclear policies'' . 

*[[Reliable Replacement Warhead Program]] (RRW): This program seeks to replace existing warheads with a smaller number of warhead types designed to be easier to maintain without testing.  Critics charge that this would lead to a new generation of nuclear weapons and would increase pressures to test.  Congress has not funded this program. 
*'''Complex Transformation''': Complex transformation, formerly known as Complex 2030, is an effort to shrink the U.S. nuclear weapons complex and restore the ability to produce “pits” the fissile cores of the primaries of U.S. thermonuclear weapons.  Critics see it as an upgrade to the entire nuclear weapons complex to support the production and maintenance of the new generation of nuclear weapons.  Congress has not funded this program. 
*[[Nuclear bunker buster]]: Formally known as the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP), this program aimed to modify an existing gravity bomb to penetrate into [[soil]] and [[Rock (geology)|rock]] in order to destroy underground targets.  Critics argue that this would lower the threshold for use of nuclear weapons.  Congress did not fund this proposal, which was later withdrawn. 
*[[National Missile Defense|Missile Defense]]: Formerly known as National Missile Defense, this program seeks to build a network of interceptor missiles to protect the United States and its allies from incoming missiles, including nuclear-armed missiles.  Critics have argued that this would impede nuclear disarmament and possibly stimulate a [[nuclear arms race]].  Elements of missile defense are being deployed in Poland and the Czech Republic, despite Russian opposition.  . 

Former U.S. officials Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Bill Perry, and Sam Nunn proposed in January 2007 that the United States rededicate itself to the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons, concluding: "We endorse setting the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons and working energetically on the actions required to achieve that goal."<ref>[http://www.2020visioncampaign.org/pages/113/Kissinger_Shultz_Perry__Nunn_call_for_A_World_Free_of_Nuclear_Weapons Kissinger, Shultz, Perry & Nunn call for A World Free of Nuclear Weapons]</ref>  Arguing a year later that "with nuclear weapons more widely available, deterrence is decreasingly effective and increasingly hazardous," the authors concluded that although "it is tempting and easy to say we can't get there from here, . . . we must chart a course” toward that goal."<ref>[http://www.2020visioncampaign.org/pages/336 Renewed call from Kissinger, Nunn, Perry and Shultz for Nuclear-Free World]</ref>  During his Presidential campaign, U.S. President Elect Barack Obama pledged to "set a goal of a world without nuclear weapons, and pursue it."<ref>[http://origin.barackobama.com/issues/foreign_policy/#nuclear Barack Obama and Joe Biden's Plan to Secure America and Restore our Standing]</ref> . 

===U.S. policy options for nuclear terrorism===. 
The United States has taken the lead in ensuring that nuclear materials globally are properly safeguarded. A popular program that has received bipartisan domestic support for over a decade is the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program (CTR). While this program has been deemed a success, many believe that its funding levels need to be increased so as to ensure that all dangerous nuclear materials are secured in the most expeditious manner possible. The CTR program has led to several other innovative and important nonproliferation programs that need to continue to be a budget priority in order to ensure that nuclear weapons do not spread to actors hostile to the United States.  . 

Key programs:
*'''Cooperative Threat Reduction''' (CTR): The CTR program provides funding to help Russia secure materials that might be used in nuclear or [[chemical weapons]] as well as to dismantle [[weapons of mass destruction]] and their associated infrastructure in Russia. 
*'''Global Threat Reduction Initiative''' (GTRI): Expanding on the success of the CTR, the GTRI will expand nuclear weapons and material securing and dismantlement activities to states outside of the former Soviet Union.  . 

==Other states==. 
{{main|List of states with nuclear weapons}} . 

While the vast majority of states have adhered to the stipulations of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, a few states have either refused to sign the treaty or have pursued nuclear weapons programs while not being members of the treaty. Many view the pursuit of nuclear weapons by these states as a threat to nonproliferation and [[world peace]], and therefore seek policies to discourage the spread of nuclear weapons to these states, a few of which are often described by the US as "rogue states".  .
