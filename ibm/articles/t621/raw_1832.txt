Major [[List of anti-nuclear groups|anti-nuclear groups]] include [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], [[Friends of the Earth]], [[Greenpeace]], [[International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War]], and the [[Nuclear Information and Resource Service]]. The initial objective of the movement was [[nuclear disarmament]], though the focus has shifted to include opposition to the use of [[nuclear power]].  . 

There have been many large anti-nuclear [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] and [[protest]]s. A protest against nuclear power occurred in July 1977 in [[Bilbao]], Spain, with up to 200,000 people in attendance. Following the [[Three Mile Island accident]] in 1979, an anti-nuclear protest  was held in New York City, involving 200,000 people. In 1981, Germany's largest anti-nuclear power demonstration took place to protest against the [[Brokdorf Nuclear Power Plant]] west of Hamburg; some 100,000 people came face to face with 10,000 police officers. The largest anti-nuclear protest was held on June 12, 1982, when one million people demonstrated in [[New York City]] against [[nuclear weapons]].  A 1983 nuclear weapons protest in [[West Berlin]] had about 600,000 participants. In May 1986, following the [[Chernobyl disaster]], an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 people marched in Rome to protest against the Italian nuclear program.  . 

For many years after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster nuclear power was off the policy agenda in most countries, and the anti-nuclear power movement seemed to have won its case. Some anti-nuclear groups disbanded.

The existential threat of [[nuclear war]] by accidental or deliberate nuclear strike is a pressing concern. <ref name=Fridab/> Also, many local communities are affected by [[nuclear weapons testing]], [[uranium mining]], and the disposal of radioactive waste. <ref name=Fridab>Frida Berrigan. [http://www.fpif.org/articles/the_new_anti-nuclear_movement The New Anti-Nuclear Movement] ''Foreign Policy in Focus'', April 16, 2010. </ref> . 

Ridding the world of nuclear weapons has been a cause of the pacifist left for a long time. But more recently mainstream politicians, retired military leaders, and academic strategists have begun to share the same goal. In January 2007 a seminal article appeared in the ''Wall Street Journal'', authored by [[Henry Kissinger]], [[William Perry|Bill Perry]], [[George Shultz]] and [[Sam Nunn]]. These men were veterans of the [[cold-war]] era with impeccable credentials as believers in using nuclear weapons for [[nuclear deterrence|deterrence]]. But they now reversed their previous position and asserted that far from making the world safer, nuclear weapons had become a source of extreme risk:<ref name=globalzero>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18836134 |title=Nuclear endgame: The growing appeal of zero |author= |date=June 16, 2011 |work=The Economist }}</ref>  . 

<blockquote>
The risk of accidents, misjudgments or unauthorised launches, they argued, was growing more acute in a world of rivalries between relatively new nuclear states that lacked the security safeguards developed over many years by America and the Soviet Union. The emergence of pariah states, such as North Korea (possibly soon to be joined by Iran), armed with nuclear weapons was adding to the fear as was the declared ambition of terrorists to steal, buy or build a nuclear device. Only by a concerted effort to free the world of nuclear weapons could the terrifying trend be reversed. <ref name=globalzero/> 
</blockquote> . 

Some scientists estimate that a war between two countries that resulted in 100 Hiroshima-size atomic explosions would cause significant loss of life, in the tens of millions. There would also be much soot thrown up into the atmosphere which would blanket the earth, causing the disruption of food chains. <ref>Philip Yam.

The public "perceives nuclear power as a very risky technology" and, around the world, nuclear energy has declined in popularity since the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]]. <ref name=rb2011/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/4/43.abstract |title=Nuclear power and the public |author=[[M.V.

''Nuclear Power is Not the Answer to Global Warming or Anything Else'', Melbourne University Press, ISBN 0-522-85251-3, p. xvii</ref> Opponents of nuclear power have raised a number of related concerns:<ref name = bm>[[Brian Martin (professor)|Brian Martin]]. [http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/07sa.html Opposing nuclear power: past and present], ''Social Alternatives'', Vol. 26, No. 2, Second Quarter 2007, pp. 43-47. </ref>
*[[Nuclear accident]]s: a concern that the core of a nuclear power plant could overheat and melt down, releasing radioactivity. 
*[[Radioactive waste disposal]]: a concern that nuclear power results in large amounts of radioactive waste, some of which remains dangerous for very long periods. 
*[[Nuclear proliferation]]: a concern that the facilities and expertise to produce nuclear power can be readily adapted to produce [[nuclear weapons]]. 
*[[Economics of new nuclear power plants|High cost]]: a concern that nuclear power plants are very expensive. 
*[[Nuclear terrorism]]: a concern that nuclear facilities could be targeted by terrorists or criminals. 
*Curtailed [[civil liberties]]: a concern that the risk of nuclear accidents, proliferation and terrorism may be used to justify restraints on citizen rights.  . 

Of these concerns, nuclear accidents and disposal of long-lived radioactive waste have probably had the greatest public impact worldwide. <ref name = bm/> Anti-nuclear campaigners point to the 2011 [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|Fukushima nuclear emergency]] as proof that nuclear power can never be 100% safe. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/mar/22/japan-nuclear-crisis-uk-power-stations |title=Japan nuclear crisis puts UK public off new power stations |author=Bibi van der Zee |date=22 March 2011 |work=The Guardian }}</ref>  . 

In his book ''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', [[Jim Falk]] explores connections between technological concerns and political concerns. Falk suggests that concerns of citizen groups or individuals who oppose nuclear power have often focused initially on the "range of physical hazards which accompany the technology". Concern often starts with a single issue, such as [[radioactive waste]], but over time concerns usually spread and the focus broadens. Falk suggests that with a richer and more sophisticated understanding of issues comes more concerns and eventually, almost inevitably says Falk, this leads to a "concern over the political relations of the nuclear industry". <ref name=jimfalk2>[[Jim Falk]] (1982). ''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', Oxford University Press, pp. 327-329. </ref> . 

[[John Vidal]] has said "The point is that right across the world it is not just the nuclear technology which is so offensive to people, but the arrogance, callousness and ruthless steamrollering of any opposition that invariably accompanies nuclear projects. What the pro-nuclear folk here do not seem to understand is that the abuse of political power is as dangerous as the power source itself". <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/feb/29/nuclear-power-energy-protest-hinkley?newsfeed=true |title=The abuse of political power is as dangerous as nuclear power itself |author=John Vidal |date=29 February 2012  |work=The Guardian }}</ref> . 

Falk argues that if all the different concerns over the physical hazards of nuclear power were distilled into one succinct statement, it might be this: "that it is a technology whose safety people deeply distrust".  Falk says that that distrust also applies more widely, to the whole nuclear enterprise:<ref name=jimfalk2/>
<blockquote>
People must have come not only to distrust the safety of the technology but also the authority of those who have assured them so confidently that nuclear power is safe. In this sense people distrust the entire nuclear enterprise -- not only its technology, but the public and private organizations, the political parties, and those often prestigious scientists who advocate and assist in the development of nuclear power. <ref name=jimfalk2/>
</blockquote> . 

In 2010, [[Baruch Fischhoff]], a social science professor said that many people really do not trust the nuclear industry. He stated that "although it hasn’t done anything recently to lose the general public’s trust, it hasn’t done anything to gain people’s trust". <ref>Matthew L. Wald. [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/22/business/energy-environment/22NUKE.html?pagewanted=all  Edging Back to Nuclear Power] ''New York Times'', April 21, 2010. </ref> . 

[[M.V. Ramana]] says that "distrust of the social institutions that manage nuclear energy is widespread", and a 2001 survey by the European Commission found that "only 10.1 percent of Europeans trusted the nuclear industry". This public distrust is periodically reinforced by safety violations by nuclear companies, or through ineffectiveness or corruption on the part of nuclear regulatory authorities. Once lost, says Ramana, trust is extremely difficult to regain. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/4/43.abstract |title=Nuclear power and the public |author=M. V. Ramana |date=July 2011 vol. 67 no. 4  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  |pages=47–48 }}</ref> . 

Faced with public antipathy, the nuclear industry has "tried a variety of strategies to persuade the public to accept nuclear power", including the publication of  numerous "fact sheets" that discuss issues of public concern. M.V. Ramana says that none of these strategies have been very successful. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/4/43.abstract |title=Nuclear power and the public |author=[[M.V. Ramana]] |date=July 2011 vol. 67 no. 4  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  |page=46 }}</ref>   . 

Nuclear proponents have tried to regain public support by offering newer, safer, reactor designs. These designs include those that  incorporate passive safety and Small Modular Reactors. While these reactor designs "are intended to inspire trust, they may have an unintended effect: creating distrust of older reactors that lack the touted safety features". <ref>{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/4/43.abstract |title=Nuclear power and the public |author=M.

Since 2000 the nuclear industry has undertaken an international media and lobbying campaign to promote nuclear power as a solution to the enhanced [[greenhouse effect]] and [[climate change]]. <ref name = markd/> Nuclear power, the industry claims, emits no or negligible amounts of carbon dioxide. Anti-nuclear groups respond by saying that only reactor operation is free of carbon dioxide emissions. All other stages of the [[nuclear fuel chain]] – mining, milling, transport, fuel fabrication, enrichment, reactor construction, decommissioning and waste management – use fossil fuels and hence emit carbon dioxide. <ref name = markd>Mark Diesendorf.

In 2011, a French court fined [[Électricité de France]] (EDF) €1.5m and jailed two senior employees for spying on Greenpeace, including hacking into Greenpeace's computer systems.

[[Image:Nirs logo.gif|thumb|Logo of the [[Nuclear Information and Resource Service]]]] . 

The anti-nuclear movement is a [[new social movements|social movement]] which operates at the local, national, and international level. Various types of groups have identified themselves with the movement:<ref name="faculty.virginia.edu"/> . 

* [[direct action]] groups, such as the [[Clamshell Alliance]] and [[Shad Alliance]];
* [[Environmentalism|environmental]] groups, such as [[Friends of the Earth]] and [[Greenpeace]];
* [[consumer protection]] groups, such as [[Ralph Nader]]'s [[List of anti-nuclear groups in the United States#Critical Mass|Critical Mass]];
* [[professional]] organisations,<ref name="nytimes.com"/> such as [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] and [[International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War]]; and
* [[political party|political parties]] such as [[European Free Alliance]].  . 

Anti-nuclear groups have undertaken public [[protest]]s and acts of [[civil disobedience]] which have included occupations of nuclear plant sites. Other salient strategies have included lobbying, petitioning government authorities, influencing [[public policy]] through referendum campaigns and involvement in elections. Anti-nuclear groups have also tried to influence policy implementation through litigation and by participating in licencing proceedings. <ref>Herbert P. Kitschelt. [http://www.marcuse.org/harold/hmimages/seabrook/861KitscheltAntiNuclear4Democracies.pdf Political Opportunity and Political Protest: Anti-Nuclear Movements in Four Democracies] ''British Journal of Political Science'', Vol. 16, No. 1, 1986, p. 67. </ref> . 

Anti-nuclear power organisations have emerged in every country that has had a nuclear power programme. Protest movements against nuclear power first emerged in the USA, at the local level, and spread quickly to Europe and the rest of the world. National nuclear campaigns emerged in the late 1970s. Fuelled by the [[Three Mile Island accident]] and the [[Chernobyl disaster]], the anti-nuclear power movement mobilised political and economic forces which for some years "made nuclear energy untenable in many countries". <ref>Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 1. </ref> . 

Some of these anti-nuclear power organisations are reported to have developed considerable expertise on [[nuclear power]] and energy issues. <ref name=schneider>Lutz Mez, Mycle Schneider and Steve Thomas (Eds.) (2009). ''International Perspectives of Energy Policy and the Role of Nuclear Power'', Multi-Science Publishing Co. Ltd, p. 279. </ref> In 1992, the chairman of the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] said that "his agency had been pushed in the right direction on safety issues because of the pleas and protests of nuclear watchdog groups". <ref>Matthew L.

In 1971, the town of [[Wyhl]], in Germany, was a proposed site for a nuclear power station. In the years that followed, public opposition steadily mounted, and there were large protests. Television coverage of police dragging away farmers and their wives helped to turn nuclear power into a major issue.  In 1975, an administrative court withdrew the construction licence for the plant. <ref name=pub>Stephen Mills and Roger Williams (1986).

''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 138. </ref>  . 

In France, there were a series of mass protests in the early 1970s, organized at nearly every planned nuclear site in France. Between 1975 and 1977, some 175,000 people protested against nuclear power in ten demonstrations. <ref name=kits>Herbert P. Kitschelt.

In West Germany, between February 1975 and April 1979, some 280,000 people were involved in seven demonstrations at nuclear sites. Several site occupations were also attempted. In the aftermath of the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, some 120,000 people attended a demonstration against nuclear power in [[Bonn]]. <ref name=kits/> . 

In the Philippines, a focal point for protests in the late 1970s and 1980s was the proposed [[Bataan Nuclear Power Plant]], which was built but never operated. <ref name=as>Yok-shiu F.

===Deaths and injuries===. 
A few injuries have occurred during anti-nuclear protests: . 

*On 10 July 1985, the flagship of [[Greenpeace]], [[Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|Rainbow Warrior]], was sunk by French agents in New Zealand waters, and a Greenpeace photographer was killed.  The ship was involved in protests against [[nuclear weapons testing]] at [[Mururoa Atoll]]. The French Government initially denied any involvement with the sinking but eventually admitted its guilt in October 1985. Two French agents pleaded guilty to charges of manslaughter and the French Government paid $7 million in damages. <ref>Newtan, Samuel Upton (2007).

===Recent developments===. 
For many years after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster nuclear power was off the policy agenda in most countries, and the anti-nuclear power movement seemed to have won its case. Some anti-nuclear groups disbanded. In the 2000s (decade), however, following [[public relations]] activities by the nuclear industry,<ref name="Diane Farseta 38–56"/><ref name="The Nuclear Charm Offensive"/><ref name="ucsusa.org"/><ref name="businessweek.com"/> [[nuclear reactor technology#Advanced reactors|advances in nuclear reactor designs]], and concerns about [[climate change]], nuclear power issues came back into [[energy policy]] discussions in some countries. The [[2011 Japanese nuclear accidents]] subsequently undermined the nuclear power industry's proposed renaissance and revived anti-nuclear passions worldwide, putting governments on the defensive. <ref name="articles.sfgate.com"/> .

Since the March 2011 Japanese [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]], "populations around proposed Indian NPP sites have launched protests that are now finding resonance around the country, raising questions about atomic energy as a clean and safe alternative to fossil fuels". <ref name=nukeindia/> Assurances by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that all safety measures will be implemented, have not been heeded, and there have thus been mass protests against the French-backed 9900 MW [[Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project]] in Maharashtra and the 2000 MW [[Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant]] in Tamil Nadu. The state government of West Bengal state has also refused permission to a proposed 6000 MW facility near the town of Haripur that intended to host six Russian reactors. <ref name=nukeindia/> A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has also been filed against the government’s civil nuclear program at the apex Supreme Court.

Michael Banach, the current [[Vatican]] representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency, told a conference in Vienna in September 2011 that “this year’s nuclear disaster in Japan has raised new concerns about the safety of nuclear plants around the world”. Auxiliary bishop of Osaka Michael Goro Matsuura said: “I believe that this serious incident should be a lesson for Japan and for the entire planet and will be an incentive to abandon these projects. We call on the solidarity of Christians worldwide to support this campaign.” After Fukushima, statements from bishops’ conferences in Korea and the Philippines called on their governments to abandon nuclear power.

Austrian Chancellor [[Werner Faymann]] expects anti-nuclear petition drives to start in at least six European Union countries in 2012 with the goal of having the EU abandon nuclear power. Under the EU's Lisbon Treaty, petitions that attract at least one million signatures can seek legislative proposals from the European Commission. This would pave the way for anti-nuclear activists to increase support. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/12/austria-nuclear-idUSL5E8EC1IN20120312 |title=Austria expects EU anti-nuclear campaign this year |author= |date=Mar 12, 2012 |work=Reuters }}</ref> . 

In March 2012, about 2,000 people staged an anti-nuclear protest in Taiwan's capital following the massive earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan one year ago. The protesters rallied in Taipei to renew calls for a nuclear-free island by taking lessons from Japan's disaster on March 11, 2011. They "want the government to scrap a plan to operate a newly constructed nuclear power plant - the fourth in densely populated Taiwan".

==Impact==. 
===Impact on popular culture===. 
{{See also|List of films about nuclear issues}}
Beginning in the 1960s, anti-nuclear ideas received coverage in the popular media with novels such as ''[[Fail-Safe (novel)|Fail-Safe]]'' and [[List of films about nuclear issues|feature films]] such as ''[[Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'' (1964), ''[[The China Syndrome]]'' (1979), ''[[Silkwood]]'' (1983), and ''[[The Rainbow Warrior (film)|The Rainbow Warrior]]'' (1992).  . 

''Dr. Strangelove'' explored "what might happen within the Pentagon ... if some maniac Air Force general should suddenly order a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union". One reviewer called the movie "one of the cleverest and most incisive satiric thrusts at the awkwardness and folly of the military that has ever been on the screen". <ref>Bosley Crowther. [http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173DE367BC4950DFB766838F679EDE Movie Review: Dr. Strangelove (1964)] ''The New York Times'', January 31, 1964. </ref> . 

''The China Syndrome'' has been described as a "gripping 1979 drama about the dangers of nuclear power" which had an extra impact when the real-life accident at the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island nuclear plant]] occurred several weeks after the film opened. [[Jane Fonda]] plays a TV reporter who witnesses a near-[[Nuclear meltdown|meltdown]] (the "[[China syndrome]]" of the title) at a local nuclear plant, which was averted by a quick-thinking engineer, played by [[Jack Lemmon]]. The plot suggests that corporate greed and cost-cutting "have led to potentially deadly faults in the plant's construction". <ref>[http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/9338/The-China-Syndrome/overview The China Syndrome (1979)] ''The New York Times''. </ref> . 

''Silkwood'' was inspired by the true-life story of [[Karen Silkwood]], who died in a suspicious car accident while investigating alleged wrongdoing at the [[Kerr-McGee]] [[plutonium]] plant where she worked. <ref name=contr/> . 

[[Musicians United for Safe Energy]] (MUSE) was a musical group founded in 1979 by [[Jackson Browne]], [[Graham Nash]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], and [[John Hall (New York)|John Hall]], following the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island nuclear accident]].  The group organized a series of five ''No Nukes'' concerts held at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City in September 1979.  On September 23, 1979, almost 200,000 people attended a large anti-nuclear rally staged by MUSE on the then-empty north end of the [[Battery Park City]] [[landfill]] in New York. <ref name=nyt>{{cite news |first=Robin |last=Herman |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Nearly 200,000 Rally to Protest Nuclear Energy |url= |work=[[New York Times]] |page=B1 |date=September 24, 1979 |accessdate= }}</ref> The album ''[[No Nukes (album)|No Nukes]]'', and a film, also titled ''[[No Nukes (film)|No Nukes]]'', were both released in 1980 to document the performances.  . 

In 2007, Bonnie Raitt, Graham Nash, and Jackson Browne, as part of the [[No Nukes group]], recorded a [[music video]] of the [[Buffalo Springfield]] song "[[For What It's Worth (Buffalo Springfield song)|For What It's Worth]]". <ref>[http://www.nukefree.org/node/96 “For What It’s Worth,” No Nukes Reunite After Thirty Years]</ref><ref>[http://www.nirs.org/home.htm Musicians Act to Stop New Atomic Reactors]</ref> .

Historian [[Lawrence S. Wittner]] has argued that anti-nuclear sentiment and activism led directly to government policy shifts about nuclear weapons. Public opinion influenced policymakers by limiting their options and also by forcing them to follow certain policies over others. Wittner credits public pressure and anti-nuclear activism with "Truman’s decision to explore the [[Baruch Plan]], Eisenhower’s efforts towards a nuclear test ban and the 1958 testing moratorium, and Kennedy’s signing of the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]]". <ref>Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

The proliferation of nuclear weapons became a presidential priority issue for the [[Carter Administration]] in the late 1970s. <ref name = gamson/> To deal with proliferation problems, President Carter promoted stronger international control over nuclear technology, including nuclear reactor technology.

For many years after the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]] nuclear power was off the policy agenda in most countries.

===Public opinion surveys on nuclear issues===. 
{{Main|Public opinion on nuclear issues}}
In 2005, the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] presented the results of a series of public opinion surveys in the ''Global Public Opinion on Nuclear Issues'' report. <ref name= IAE/>  Majorities of respondents in 14 of the 18 countries surveyed believe that the risk of [[nuclear terrorism|terrorist acts involving radioactive materials]] at nuclear facilities is high, because of insufficient protection. While majorities of citizens generally support the continued use of existing nuclear power reactors, most people do not favour the building of new nuclear plants, and 25% of respondents feel that all nuclear power plants should be closed down. <ref name= IAE/> Stressing the [[climate change]] benefits of nuclear energy positively influences 10% of people to be more supportive of expanding the role of nuclear power in the world, but there is still a general reluctance to support the building of more nuclear power plants. <ref name= IAE>[[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (2005). [http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Reports/gponi_report2005.pdf Global Public Opinion on Nuclear Issues and the IAEA: Final Report from 18 Countries] pp. 6-7. </ref> . 

There is little support across the world for building new nuclear reactors, a 2011 poll for the BBC indicates. The global research agency [[GlobeScan]], commissioned by BBC News, polled 23,231 people in 23 countries from July to September 2011, several months after the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]]. In countries with existing nuclear programmes, people are significantly more opposed than they were in 2005, with only the UK and US bucking the trend. Most believe that boosting energy efficiency and renewable energy can meet their needs. <ref name=rb2011>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15864806 |title=Nuclear power 'gets little public support worldwide' |author=Richard Black  |date=25 November 2011 |work=BBC News }}</ref> . 

==Criticism==. 
Some environmentalists criticise the anti-nuclear movement for under-stating the environmental costs of fossil fuels and non-nuclear alternatives, and overstating the environmental costs of nuclear energy. <ref name=autogenerated4>[http://www.ecolo.org/media/articles/articles.in.english/love-indep-24-05-04.htm James Lovelock: Nuclear power is the only green solution]</ref><ref name=autogenerated3>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/14/AR2006041401209.html Going Nuclear]</ref> Of the numerous nuclear experts who have offered their expertise in addressing controversies, [[Bernard Cohen (physicist)|Bernard Cohen]], Professor Emeritus of Physics at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], is likely the most frequently cited.  In his extensive writings he examines the safety issues in detail.  He is best known for comparing nuclear safety to the relative safety of a wide range of other phenomena. <ref>[http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~blc/ Bernard Cohen]</ref><ref>[http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~blc/book/BOOK.html The Nuclear Energy Option]</ref> . 

Anti-nuclear activists are accused of representing the risks of nuclear power in an unfair way. ''The War Against the Atom'' (Basic Books, 1982) Samuel MacCracken of Boston University argued that in 1982, 50,000 deaths per year could be attributed directly to non-nuclear power plants, if fuel production and transportation, as well as pollution, were taken into account. He argued that if non-nuclear plants were judged by the same standards as nuclear ones, each US non-nuclear power plant could be held responsible for about 100 deaths per year. <ref>Samuel MacCracken, ''The War Against the Atom'', 1982, Basic Books, pp. 60-61</ref> . 

The [[Nuclear Energy Institute]]<ref>[http://www.nei.org/ Nuclear Energy Institute] website</ref> (NEI) is the main lobby group for companies doing nuclear work in the USA, while most countries that employ nuclear energy have a national industry group. The [[World Nuclear Association]] is the only global trade body.  In seeking to counteract the arguments of nuclear opponents, it points to independent studies that quantify the costs and benefits of nuclear energy and compares them to the costs and benefits of alternatives.  NEI sponsors studies of its own, but it also references studies performed for the [[World Health Organisation]],<ref>Fourth Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health: Budapest, Hungary, 23–25 June 2004</ref> for the [[International Energy Agency]],<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://ww.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/ElecCostSUM.pdf Executive Summary]</ref> and by university researchers. <ref>Ari Rabl and Mona.

Critics of the anti-nuclear movement point to independent studies that show that the capital resources required for renewable energy sources are higher than those required for nuclear power. <ref name=autogenerated2 /> . 

Some people, including former opponents of nuclear energy, criticise the movement on the basis of the claim that nuclear energy is necessary for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. These individuals include [[James Lovelock]],<ref name=autogenerated4 /> originator of the [[Gaia hypothesis]], [[Patrick Moore (environmentalist)|Patrick Moore]],<ref name=autogenerated3 /> a co-founder of [[Greenpeace]] and former director of Greenpeace International, [[George Monbiot]] and [[Stewart Brand]], creator of the [[Whole Earth Catalog]]. <ref>[http://www.technologyreview.com/article/16398/ Environmental Heresies]</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/27/science/earth/27tier.html?ex=1330405200&en=e561a6494b06049d&ei=5124&partner=digg&exprod=digg An Early Environmentalist, Embracing New ‘Heresies’]</ref> Lovelock goes further to refute claims about the danger of nuclear energy and its waste products. <ref>[http://www.ecolo.org/lovelock/ James Lovelock]</ref> In a January 2008 interview, Moore said that "It wasn't until after I'd left Greenpeace and the climate change issue started coming to the forefront that I started rethinking energy policy in general and realised that I had been incorrect in my analysis of nuclear as being some kind of evil plot."<ref>[http://www.news.com/From-eco-warrior-to-nuclear-champion/2008-13840_3-6228461.html]</ref> . 

Some anti-nuclear organisations have acknowledged that their positions are subject to review. <ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-03-22-nuclear-power_N.htm Some rethinking nuke opposition] USA Today</ref> Nuclear-energy opponents take the position that militant environmentalist organisations have not changed their views:
<blockquote>
While some environmentalists, in the interests of reducing the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated with burning carbon-based fuels, have switched from anti- to pro-nuclear power in recent years, it is clear that many — if not most — of the militant environmentalist organizations remain adamantly opposed to the expansion of nuclear power. Many even propose decommissioning and dismantling the existing nuclear power electrical plants. <ref>William F. Jasper.

</blockquote>
In April 2007, Dan Becker, Director of Global Warming for the Sierra Club, declared, "Switching from dirty coal plants to dangerous nuclear power is like giving up smoking cigarettes and taking up crack."<ref>http://www.newstrib.com/featured-series/energy-series/Articles/A_7-20-2007_1_4.pdf</ref>  James Lovelock, who originally proposed the Gaia hypothesis, criticizes holders of such a view: "Opposition to nuclear energy is based on irrational fear fed by Hollywood-style fiction, the Green lobbies and the media."  ". . .I am a Green and I entreat my friends in the movement to drop their wrongheaded objection to nuclear energy."<ref>[http://www.ecolo.org/media/articles/articles.in.english/love-indep-24-05-04.htm The Independent, 24 May 2004]</ref> . 

George Monbiot, an English writer known for his environmental and political activism, once expressed deep antipathy to the nuclear industry. <ref>George Monbiot [http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2000/mar/30/energy.nuclearindustry?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 "The nuclear winter draws near"], ''The Guardian'', 30 March 2000</ref> He finally rejected his later neutral position regarding nuclear power in March 2011. Although he "still loathe[s] the liars who run the nuclear industry",<ref name="Monbiot2011">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/mar/21/pro-nuclear-japan-fukushima/|title=Why Fukushima made me stop worrying and love nuclear power|last=Monbiot|first=George|date=21 March 2011|work=The Guardian|accessdate=22 March 2011}}</ref> Monbiot now advocates its use, having been convinced of its relative safety by what he considers the limited effects of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|2011 Japan tsunami]] on nuclear reactors in the region. <ref name="Monbiot2011"/> Subsequently, he has harshly condemned the anti-nuclear movement, writing that it "has misled the world about the impacts of radiation on human health ... made [claims] ungrounded in science, unsupportable when challenged and wildly wrong." He singled out [[Helen Caldicott]] for, he wrote, making unsourced and inaccurate claims, dismissing contrary evidence as part of a cover-up, and overstating the death toll from the [[Chernobyl disaster]] by a factor of more than 140. <ref name="Monbiot2011-2">{{cite news|url=http://www.monbiot.com/2011/04/04/evidence-meltdown/|title=Evidence Meltdown|last=Monbiot|first=George|date=4 April 2011|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref> .
