A '''tactical nuclear weapon''' (or '''TNW''') refers to a [[nuclear weapon]] which is designed to be used on a battlefield in military situations. This is as opposed to [[strategic nuclear weapon]]s which are designed to menace large populations, to damage the enemy's ability to wage war, or for general deterrence. Tactical nuclear weapons were a large part of the peak [[nuclear weapon]]s stockpile levels during the [[Cold War]].  . 

==Types==. 
[[Image:W48 155-millimeter nuclear shell.jpg|right|thumb|US scientists with a full-scale cut-away model of the [[W48]] 155-millimeter [[nuclear artillery]] shell, a very small tactical nuclear weapon with an explosive yield equivalent to 72 tons of [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] (0.072 [[kiloton]]). It could be fired from any standard 155&nbsp;mm (6.1&nbsp;inch) [[howitzer]] e.g. the [[M114 155 mm howitzer|M114]] or [[M198 howitzer|M198]]]]

It could be fired from any standard 8&nbsp;inch (203mm) [[howitzer]] e.g. the [[M110 howitzer|M110]] or [[M115 howitzer|M115]] ]] . 

Tactical weapons include not only [[gravity bomb]]s and short-range [[missile]]s, but also [[Nuclear artillery|artillery shell]]s, [[land mine]]s, [[depth charge]]s, and [[torpedo]]es for [[anti-submarine warfare]]. Also in this category are nuclear armed ground-based or shipborne [[surface-to-air missiles]] (SAMs) and [[air-to-air missile]]s.  . 

Small, two-man portable, or truck-portable, tactical weapons (sometimes misleadingly referred to as [[suitcase nuke]]s), such as the [[Special Atomic Demolition Munition]] and the [[Davy Crockett (nuclear device)|Davy Crockett recoilless rifle]], have been developed, although the difficulty of combining sufficient yield with portability could limit their military utility. In wartime, such explosives could be used for demolishing "choke-points" to enemy offensives, such as at [[tunnel]]s, narrow mountain passes, and long [[viaduct]]s.  Twenty nuclear torpedo sea mines were alleged by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] to have been laid on 10 January 1970 by a Soviet [[November class]] attack submarine in the [[Bay of Naples]] to, in a time of war, destroy or deny access to the US Seventh Fleet. They are believed to still be on the seabed. <ref>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/soviet-navy-left-20-nuclear-warheads-in-bay-of-naples-6150280.html</ref>  . 

Other new tactical weapons undergoing research include [[earth penetrating weapons]] which are designed to target enemy-held caves or deep-underground bunkers.  . 

There is no precise definition of the "tactical" category, neither considering range nor [[nuclear weapon yield|yield of the nuclear weapon]]. <ref name=e>{{cite book|title=Tactical nuclear weapons : emergent threats in an evolving security environment.|year=2003|publisher=Brassey's|location=Washington DC|isbn=9781574885859|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=y7VOWkKMTjsC&lpg=PA105&dq=Defensive%20Use%20of%20Tactical%20Nuclear%20Weapons&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false|edition=1. ed.|editor=Brian Alexander, Alistair Millar|accessdate=22 March 2011|page=7}}</ref><ref>Some weapons could be tactical or strategic at the same time, depending only on the potential enemy. For example India nuclear missile with 500 km range is tactical when evaluated by Russian side, but understandably would be considered strategic if evaluated by Pakistan. </ref> The yield of tactical nuclear weapons is generally lower than that of strategic nuclear weapons, but they are still very powerful, and some variable-yield warheads serve in both roles.  Modern tactical nuclear warheads have yields up to the tens of kilotons, or potentially hundreds, several times that of the weapons used in the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].  . 

Some tactical nuclear weapons have specific features meant to enhance their battlefield characteristics, such as [[variable yield]] which allow their explosive power to be varied over a wide range for different situations, or [[enhanced radiation weapon]]s (the so-called "[[neutron bomb]]s") which are meant to maximize ionizing radiation exposure while minimizing blast effects.  . 

==Risk of escalating a conflict== . 

Use of tactical nuclear weapons against similarly-armed opponents carries a significant danger of quickly escalating the conflict beyond anticipated boundaries, from the tactical to the [[strategic nuclear weapon|strategic]]. <ref>http://web.mit.edu/SSP/Publications/confseries/russia/session10.htm</ref><ref name="Patchen1988">{{cite book|last=Patchen|first=Martin|title=Resolving disputes between nations: coercion or conciliation?|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Yi_HjfCVftAC&pg=PA254&lpg=PA254&dq=tactical+nuclear+weapon+escalation&source=bl&ots=mo0uBYh1-k&sig=mEU1gaaB0TZ1KIenhnyo05uys2s&hl=en&ei=BYP6S5a1GpTw0gTz5OnpBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CB4Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=tactical%20nuclear%20weapon%20escalation&f=false|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=1988-04|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822308195|page=254}}</ref><ref>http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2009_10/Kelleher</ref><ref name="Strachan1988">{{cite book|last=Strachan|first=Hew|title=European Armies and the Conduct of War|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=z659ye6lg9AC&pg=PA195&lpg=PA195&dq=tactical+nuclear+weapon+escalation&source=bl&ots=gZv3WruKhE&sig=VAaTQ-P6MLC5O4l07TyBuXxIj3k&hl=en&ei=BYP6S5a1GpTw0gTz5OnpBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CCgQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=tactical%20nuclear%20weapon%20escalation&f=false|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=1988-01-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415078634|page=195}}</ref><ref name="Inc.1975">{{cite book|last=Inc.|first=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science,|title=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dQsAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA25&lpg=PA25&dq=tactical+nuclear+weapon+escalation&source=bl&ots=79TB5lq491&sig=DDU2KzR-P8v7eec_Rg3N860op_A&hl=en&ei=bYP6S4qkAY-I0wTRmuHpBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&q=tactical%20nuclear%20weapon%20escalation&f=false|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=1975-05|publisher=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science, Inc.|page=25}}</ref><ref>http://www.pugwash.org/reports/nw/situgna.htm</ref> Ironically, the smallest tactical nuclear warheads with the lowest-yields are the most dangerous in this respect because they greatly reduce the threshold for starting nuclear warfare<ref>http://www.nti.org/e_research/e3_10a.html</ref><ref>http://cns.miis.edu/reports/tnw_nat.htm</ref> i.e. there is, naturally, much less reluctance to use a nuclear weapon with a destructive yield of 10 tons of [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] (e.g. the [[W54]] warhead design) at times of crisis than there is for a warhead with a yield of 100 [[kiloton]]s.  .

[[Image:Red Beard Bomb On Trolley.jpg|right|thumb|[[Red Beard (nuclear weapon)|Red Beard]], a [[UK|British]] [[gravity bomb]] of the early 1960s with a destructive yield of 25 kilotons]] . 

For example, firing a low-yield [[nuclear artillery]] shell similar to the [[W48]] (with a yield equivalent to 72 tons of TNT) at the enemy invites retaliation. It may provoke the enemy into responding with several nuclear artillery shells similar to the [[W79]], which had a 1 kiloton yield. The response to these 1 kiloton nuclear artillery shells may be to retaliate by firing a tactical nuclear missile similar to a [[France|French]] [[Pluton (missile)|Pluton]] (15 kiloton yield) or the American [[MGM-52 Lance]], fitted with a [[W70]] [[variable yield]] warhead ranging between 1 and 100 kilotons. Clearly, by using tactical nuclear weapons there is a high risk of escalating the conflict until it reaches a [[tipping point]] which provokes the use of [[strategic nuclear weapons]] such as [[ICBM]]s. Additionally, the tactical nuclear weapons most likely to be used first (i.e. the smallest, low-yield weapons such as [[nuclear artillery]] dating from the 1960s) have usually been under less stringent political control at times of military combat crises than strategic weapons. <ref>http://www.atomictraveler.com/RockIsland.pdf</ref> Early [[Permissive Action Link]]s could be as simple as a mechanical combination lock. <ref>http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons/Pal.html</ref> If a relatively junior officer in control of a small tactical nuclear weapon (e.g. the [[Davy Crockett (nuclear device)|M29 Davy Crockett]]) were in imminent danger of being overwhelmed by enemy forces, he could request permission to fire it and due to decentralised control of warhead authorization, his request might quickly be granted during a crisis.  . 

For these reasons, stockpiles of tactical nuclear warheads in most countries' arsenals have been dramatically reduced c. 2010, and the smallest types have been completely eliminated. <ref>http://www.fas.org/nuke/control/inf/inf-chron.htm</ref> Additionally, the increased sophistication of "Category F" [[permissive action link|PAL]] mechanisms and their associated communications infrastructure mean that centralised control of tactical nuclear warheads (by the country's most senior political leaders) can now be retained, even during combat.  . 

Some [[variable yield]] nuclear warheads such as the [[B61 nuclear bomb]] have been produced in both tactical and strategic versions. Whereas the lowest selectable yield of a tactical B61 (Mod 3 and Mod 4) is 0.3 kilotons (300 tons),<ref>http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons/B61.html</ref> modern PAL mechanisms ensure that centralised political control is maintained over each weapon, including their destructive yields.  . 

With the introduction of the B61 Mod 12, the United States will have four hundred identical nuclear bombs whose strategic or tactical nature will be set purely by the type of aircraft on which they are carried. <ref>Kristensen, Hans.

==Treaty control==. 
Ten NATO member countries have advanced a confidence building plan for NATO and Russia that could lead to treaties to reduce the tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. <ref>Kristensen, Hans.
