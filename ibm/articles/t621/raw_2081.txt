{{Weapons of mass destruction}}
[[Mexico]] is one of the few countries which has capabilities to manufacture [[nuclear weapon]]s but has renounced them and pledged to only use its nuclear technology for peaceful purposes following the [[Treaty of Tlatelolco]] in 1968. <ref name="opanal1">{{cite web|url=http://www.opanal.org/opanal/Tlatelolco/Tlatelolco-i.htm |title=Text of the Treaty of Tlatelolco |publisher=Opanal.org |date=1963-11-27 |accessdate=2010-12-19}}</ref> In the 1970s Mexico's national institute for nuclear research successfully enriched weapons-grade [[uranium]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inin.gob.mx/ |title=Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Nucleares |publisher=inin.gob.mx |date= |accessdate=2010-12-19}}</ref> which is used in the construction of nuclear weapons.

==Weapons-grade uranium refinement and clandestine nuclear program==. 
Beginning in the late 1960s the [[Mexican army]] began working with the [[Nuclear power in Mexico#Mexico|Mexican National Nuclear Investigation Institute]] or "ININ" (now part of [[Comisión Federal de Electricidad|CFE]]), the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], and the former Mexican space agency [[CONE]] (now being refounded with several other groups into the Mexican Space Agency, [[Agencia Espacial Mexicana|AEM]]) to begin the process of manufacturing the necessary components to build and deliver nuclear weapons and their respective military systems.  . 

Researchers from [[UNAM]], [[Comisión Federal de Electricidad|ININ]] and the [[Mexican army]] were successful in highly-enriching uranium until reaching weapons-grade by 1974. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inin.gob.mx/ |title=Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Nucleares |publisher=inin.gob.mx |date= |accessdate=2010-12-19}}</ref> The plan for delivery of the nuclear weapons was to fit a [[warhead]] on a modified variant of the [[rocket|space launch rockets]] built by [[AEM|CONE]] (footage:<ref>{{cite web|author=&ldquo;&rdquo; |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpzJQJ8jgZg&feature=player_embedded |title=Mas alla del Cielo de Leonardo Ferrera,Televisa (parte1/4) |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-12-18 |accessdate=2010-12-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=&ldquo;&rdquo; |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-DVEnUk_XQ&feature=mfu_in_order&list=UL |title=Mas alla del Cielo de Leonardo Ferrera,Televisa (parte 2/4) |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-12-18 |accessdate=2010-12-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=&ldquo;&rdquo; |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wNPDBaXZW0&feature=BF&list=ULMHPVqMgNYBM&index=3 |title=Mas alla del Cielo de Leonardo Ferrera,Televisa (parte 3/4) |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-12-18 |accessdate=2010-12-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=&ldquo;&rdquo; |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJtt49SoddQ&feature=BF&list=ULMHPVqMgNYBM&index=4 |title=Mas alla del Cielo de Leonardo Ferrera,Televisa (parte 4/4) |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-12-18 |accessdate=2010-12-19}}</ref>).  . 

The project was approved by President [[Gustavo Díaz Ordaz]] in 1968 following the [[Tlatelolco massacre]], due to fear of possible influence from [[communism|communist powers]] ([[Red scare]]). During these years the Mexican military went through a large modernization and expansion including new armored vehicles, guns, and [[aircraft]]. The Mexican government however could not openly create a nuclear weapon at this time due to the fact that Mexico had signed the [[Treaty of Tlatelolco]] in which Mexico agreed not to manufacture nuclear weapons and to limit its nuclear technology for peaceful purposes only. <ref name="opanal1"/>  . 

Mexico's nuclear research institute<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inin.gob.mx/ |title=Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Nucleares |publisher=Inin.gob.mx |date= |accessdate=2010-12-19}}</ref> does possess weapons-grade uranium and the technology to refine it, however it is not known if Mexico ever did successfully build nuclear weapons. <ref name="opanal1"/> . 

==Current status==. 
In April 2010, the Mexican government reportedly reached an agreement to turn over its weapons-grade uranium to the [[United States]]<ref name="autogenerated1"/><ref name="autogenerated2"/> but this has not yet been approved by the Mexican Congress and the uranium remains in the country. It is not known if Mexico successfully tested a nuclear weapon although some have theorized that Mexico could have been a potential party in the nuclear detonation known as the [[Vela Incident]]. It is possible that the Mexican Army does possess nuclear weapons or is still keeping open the possibility of obtaining nuclear weapons as the [[Mexican military]] continues to have a presence in Mexico's nuclear research institutes and maintains oversight over a nuclear research reactor of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]]. <ref>http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull284/28405391416.pdf</ref> .
