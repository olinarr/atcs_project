A '''salted bomb''' is a variation of a [[nuclear weapon]] designed to produce enhanced quantities of [[radioactive fallout]], rendering a large area uninhabitable. <ref name="Bushan">{{cite book

The idea originated with Hungarian-American physicist [[Leo Szilard]], in February 1950.  His intent was not to propose that such a weapon be built, but to show that nuclear weapon technology would soon reach the point where it could end human life on Earth. <ref name="Bushan" /><ref name="Sublette">{{cite web

Salted versions of both [[Fission bomb|fission]] and [[Hydrogen bomb|fusion weapons]] can be made by surrounding the core of the explosive device with a material containing an element that can be converted to a highly [[radioactive isotope]] by [[neutron]] bombardment. <ref name="Bushan"/>  When the bomb explodes, the element absorbs neutrons released by the nuclear reaction, converting it to its radioactive form.  The explosion scatters the resulting radioactive material over a wide area, leaving it uninhabitable far longer than an area affected by typical nuclear weapons.   . 

In a salted [[hydrogen bomb]], the radiation case around the [[Lithium deuteride|fusion fuel]], which normally is made of some [[fissionable]] [[Chemical element|element]], is replaced with a metallic salting element.  Salted fission bombs can be made by replacing the [[neutron reflector]] between the fissionable core and the explosive layer with a metallic element.  The energy [[Nuclear weapon yield|yield]] from a salted weapon is usually lower than from an ordinary weapon of similar size as a consequence of these changes.  . 

The radioactive isotope chosen for the fallout material is usually a high intensity [[gamma ray]] emitter, with a [[half-life]] long enough that it remains lethal for an extended period.  It also must have a chemistry that causes it to return to earth as fallout, rather than stay in the atmosphere after being vaporized in the explosion.  . 

One example of a salted bomb is a proposed [[cobalt bomb]], which produces the radioactive isotope cobalt-60 ([[cobalt-60|<sup>60</sup>Co]]).  Other non-fissionable isotopes can be produced, including gold-198
([[Gold#Isotopes|<sup>198</sup>Au]]), tantalum-182 ([[Tantalum#Isotopes|<sup>182</sup>Ta]]) and zinc-65
([[Zinc#Isotopes|<sup>65</sup>Zn]]). <ref name="Sublette" /> Sodium-23 has also been proposed as a salting agent. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,828877,00.html | work=Time | title=Science: fy for Doomsday | date=November 24, 1961}}</ref> . 

No salted bomb has ever been atmospherically tested and as far as is publicly known none have ever been built. <ref name="Bushan" />   The United Kingdom did test a 1 kiloton bomb incorporating a small amount of cobalt as an experimental [[Radioactive tracer|radiochemical tracer]] at their [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|Tadje]] testing site in [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|Maralinga]] range, Australia on September 14, 1957<ref>{{cite web
