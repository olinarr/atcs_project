During the final stages of [[World War II]] in 1945, the [[Allies of World War II]] conducted two '''atomic bombings against the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki''' in Japan. These two events are the only use of [[nuclear weapon]]s in war to date.  . 

Following a [[bombing of Japan|firebombing campaign]] that destroyed many Japanese cities, the Allies prepared for a costly [[Operation Downfall|invasion of Japan]]. The [[European Theatre of World War II|war in Europe]] ended when [[Nazi Germany]] signed its [[German Instrument of Surrender|instrument of surrender]]  on 8 May, but the [[Pacific War]] continued. Together with the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Republic of China]], the United States called for a surrender of Japan in the [[Potsdam Declaration]] on 26 July 1945, threatening Japan with "prompt and utter destruction". The Japanese government [[mokusatsu|ignored]] this ultimatum, and two nuclear weapons developed by the [[Manhattan Project]] were deployed. [[Little Boy]] was dropped on the city of [[Hiroshima]] on 6 August 1945, followed by the [[Fat Man]] over [[Nagasaki]] on 9 August.  . 

Within the first two to four months of the bombings, the acute effects killed 90,000–166,000 people in Hiroshima and 60,000–80,000 in Nagasaki, with roughly half of the deaths in each city occurring on the first day. The Hiroshima prefecture health department estimated that, of the people who died on the day of the explosion, 60% died from flash or flame burns, 30% from falling debris and 10% from other causes. During the following months, large numbers died from the effect of burns, [[radiation sickness]], and other injuries, compounded by illness. In a U.S. estimate of the total immediate and short term cause of death, 15–20% died from radiation sickness, 20–30% from burns, and 50–60% from other injuries, compounded by illness. In both cities, most of the dead were civilians, although Hiroshima had a sizeable garrison.  . 

On 15 August, six days after the bombing of Nagasaki, Japan announced [[Surrender of Japan|its surrender]] to the Allies, signing the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|Instrument of Surrender]] on 2 September, officially ending World War II. The bombings led, in part, to [[Post-Occupation Japan|post-war Japan]]'s adopting [[Three Non-Nuclear Principles]], forbidding the nation from nuclear armament. The role of the bombings in Japan's surrender and their [[ethics|ethical]] justification are [[Debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|still debated]].  . 

==Background==. 
===Pacific War===. 
[[File:Anti-Japan2 University of Minnesota Libraries scan.jpg|thumb|right|200px|upright|Anti-Japanese poster depicting the [[Bataan Death March]]. Allied propaganda emphasised earlier defeats rather than later victories in the Pacific.]]
{{main|Pacific War}}
In 1945, the [[Pacific War]] between the [[Empire of Japan]] and the [[Allies of World War II]] had entered its fourth year. [[World War II]] was not winding down. Instead, the fighting was being prosecuted with ever-increasing fury. Of the 1.25 million battle casualties incurred by the United States in World War II, nearly one million occurred in the twelve month period from June 1944 to June 1945. December 1944 saw American battle casualties hit an all-time monthly high of 88,000 as a result of the German [[Ardennes Offensive]].{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=2–3, 49–51}} . 

In the Pacific during this period, the Allies [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|captured the Mariana and Palau Islands]],{{sfn|Williams|1960|pp=211, 274}} [[Philippines Campaign (1944–45)|returned to the Philippines]],{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=307}} and [[Borneo campaign|invaded Borneo]].{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=527}}  The policy of bypassing Japanese forces was abandoned. In order to free troops for use elsewhere, offensives were undertaken to reduce the Japanese forces remaining in [[Battle of Bougainville|Bougainville]], [[Aitape-Wewak campaign|New Guinea]] and the Philippines.{{sfn|Long|1963|pp=48–49}} In April 1945, American forces had [[Okinawa campaign|landed on Okinawa]], where heavy fighting would continue until June. Along the way, the ratio of Japanese deaths to American casualties dropped from 5 to 1 in the Philippines to 2 to 1 on Okinawa.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=2–3, 49–51}} . 

===Preparations to invade Japan===. 
{{Main|Operation Downfall}}
Even before the [[Surrender of Nazi Germany in World War II|surrender of Nazi Germany]] on 8 May 1945, plans were already underway for the largest operation of the Pacific War, [[Operation Downfall]], the invasion of Japan.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=32–34}} The operation had two parts: Operations Olympic and Coronet. Set to begin in October 1945, Olympic involved a series of landings by the [[Sixth United States Army|U.S. Sixth Army]] intended to capture the southern third of the southernmost main Japanese island, [[Kyūshū]].{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=125–130}} Operation Olympic was to be followed in  March 1946 by Operation Coronet, the capture of the [[Kantō Plain]], near [[Tokyo]] on the Japanese island of [[Honshū]] by the U.S. [[First United States Army|First]], [[Eighth United States Army|Eighth]] and [[Tenth United States Army|Tenth]] Armies. The target date was chosen to allow for Olympic to complete its objectives, troops to be redeployed from Europe, and the Japanese winter to pass.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=169–171}} . 

[[File:Afficheamericaine2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|200px|US Army poster  prepares the public for the invasion of Japan|alt=Uncle Sam holding a spanner, rolling up his sleeves]]
[[Geography of Japan|Japan's geography]] made this invasion plan obvious to the Japanese as well; they were able to predict the Allied invasion plans accurately and thus adjust their defensive plan, Operation Ketsugō, accordingly. The Japanese planned an all-out defense of Kyūshū, with little left in reserve for any subsequent defense operations.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=45–48}} Four veteran divisions were withdrawn from the [[Kwantung Army]] in [[Manchuria]] in March 1945 to strengthen the forces in Japan,{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|p=21}} and 45 new divisions were activated between February and May 1945. Most were immobile formations for coastal defence, but 16 were high quality mobile divisions.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=70–72}} In all, there were 2.3 million Japanese Army troops prepared to defend the Japanese home islands, another 4 million Army and Navy employees, and a [[Volunteer Fighting Corps|civilian militia]] of 28 million men and women. Casualty predictions varied widely, but were extremely high. The Vice Chief of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff]], [[Vice Admiral]] [[Takijirō Ōnishi]], predicted up to 20 million Japanese deaths.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=121–124}} . 

The Americans were alarmed by the Japanese build up, which was accurately tracked through [[Ultra]] intelligence.{{sfn|Drea|1992|pp=202–225}} [[United States Secretary of War]] [[Henry Lewis Stimson]] was sufficiently concerned about high American estimates of probable casualties to commission his own study by [[Quincy Wright]] and [[William Shockley]]. Wright and Shockley spoke with Colonels [[James McCormack]] and [[Dean Rusk]], and examined casualty forecasts by [[Michael DeBakey]] and Gilbert Beebe. Wright and Shockley estimated the invading Allies would suffer between 1.7 and 4&nbsp;million casualties in such a scenario, of whom between 400,000 and 800,000 would be dead, while Japanese casualties would have been around 5 to 10 million.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=98–99}}{{sfn|Frank|1999|p=340}} . 

The [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]], [[General of the Army]] [[George C. Marshall]] began contemplating the use of a weapon which was "readily available and which assuredly can decrease the cost in American lives":{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|p=112}} [[poison gas]]. Quantities of [[phosgene]], [[mustard gas]], [[tear gas]] and [[cyanogen chloride]] were moved to [[Luzon]] from stockpiles in Australia and New Guinea in preparation for Operation Olympic, and General of the Army [[Douglas MacArthur]] ensured that [[Chemical Warfare Service]] units were trained in their use.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|p=112}} . 

===Air raids on Japan===. 
{{Main|Air raids on Japan}}
[[File:Boeing B-29A-45-BN Superfortress 44-61784 6 BG 24 BS - Incendiary Journey.jpg|thumb|alt=Black and white photo of a four engined World War II-era aircraft being viewed from above while it is flying over a city. A large cloud of smoke is visible immediately below the aircraft.|A B-29 over Osaka on 1 June 1945]] . 

While the United States had developed plans for an air campaign against Japan prior to the Pacific War, the capture of Allied bases in the western Pacific in the first weeks of the conflict meant that this offensive did not begin until mid-1944 when the long-ranged [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] became ready for use in combat. [[Operation Matterhorn]] involved India-based B-29s staging through bases around [[Chengtu]] in China to make a series of raids on strategic targets in Japan between June 1944 and January 1945. This effort proved unsuccessful due to logistical difficulties with the remote location, technical problems with the new and advanced aircraft, unfavourable weather conditions, and ultimately enemy action.{{sfn|Sandler|2001|pp=24–26}} . 

[[USAAF]] [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Haywood S. Hansell]] determined that [[Guam]], [[Tinian]] and [[Saipan]] in the [[Mariana Islands]] would better serve as B-29 bases, but they were in Japanese hands. Strategies were shifted to accommodate the air war, and the [[Marianas campaign|islands were captured]] between June and August 1944. Air bases were developed, and B-29 operations commenced from the Marianas in November 1944, greatly expanding the scope of the strategic bombing campaign against Japan.{{sfn|Sandler|2001|pp=24–26}} . 

These attacks initially targeted key industrial facilities, but from March 1945 they were frequently directed against urban areas. The capture of Okinawa in June 1945 provided airfields even closer to the Japanese mainland, allowing the bombing campaign to be escalated further. Over the next six months, the [[XXI Bomber Command]] fire-bombed 67 Japanese cities. The 9–10 March [[Bombing of Tokyo]] caused 80,000–100,000 casualties and destroyed {{convert|16|sqmi}} of the city with 267,000 buildings–the deadliest of the war. Aircraft flying from Allied [[aircraft carrier]]s and the [[Ryukyu Islands]] also regularly struck targets in Japan during 1945 in preparation for Operation Downfall.{{sfn|Kerr|1991|p=207}} . 

The Japanese military was unable to stop the Allied attacks, and the country's [[civil defense]] preparations proved inadequate. From April 1945, the Japanese Army and Naval Air Forces stopped attempting to intercept the air raids in order to preserve fighter aircraft to counter the expected invasion.{{sfn|Zaloga|Noon|2010|p=54}} By mid-1945 the Japanese also only occasionally scrambled aircraft to intercept individual B-29s conducting reconnaissance sorties over the country in order to conserve supplies of fuel.{{sfn|Zaloga|Noon|2010|pp=58–59}} By July 1945, the Japanese had stockpiled {{convert|1156000|usbbl}} of [[avgas]] for the invasion of Japan.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=79–80}} . 

===Manhattan Project===.

Two types of bombs were eventually devised by scientists and technicians at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] under American [[physics|physicist]] [[Robert Oppenheimer]]. The Hiroshima bomb, known as [[Little Boy]], was a [[gun-type fission weapon]] made with [[uranium-235]], a rare [[isotope]] of uranium extracted in giant factories in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]].{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=522}} The other was an [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]] using [[plutonium-239]], a [[synthetic element]] created in [[nuclear reactor]]s at [[Hanford Site|Hanford, Washington]]. A test implosion weapon, [[the gadget]], was detonated at [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity Site]], on 16 July 1945, near [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]].{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=511–516}} The Nagasaki bomb, [[Fat Man]] was also an implosion device.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=534–536}} . 

==Preparations==. 
===Organization and training===. 
[[File:Agnew HiroshimaAircraft.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Aircraft of the [[509th Composite Group]] immediately before the Hiroshima bombing.  Left to right: backup plane, [[The Great Artiste]], [[Enola Gay]] ]]
The [[509th Composite Group]] was constituted on 9 December 1944, and activated on 17 December 1944, at [[Wendover Army Air Field]], [[Utah]], commanded by [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Paul W. Tibbets]]. <ref name="509offhist">{{cite web | url = http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=10517 | title = Factsheets: 509th Operational Group | publisher=Air Force Historical Studies Office| accessdate =25 December 2011 }}</ref> Tibbets was assigned to organize and command a [[USAAF bombardment group|combat group]] to develop the means of delivering an atomic weapon against targets in Germany and Japan. Because the flying squadrons of the group consisted of both bomber and transport aircraft, the group was designated as a "composite" rather than a "bombardment" unit.  . 

Working with the Manhattan Project at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Site Y]] in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]], Tibbets selected Wendover for his training base over [[Great Bend, Kansas|Great Bend]], Kansas, and [[Mountain Home, Idaho|Mountain Home]], Idaho because of its remoteness. <ref name="wendchoice">{{cite web | url = http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Aug-06-Sat-2005/news/26902506.html| title = Hiroshima 60 Years Later| publisher=Review Journal 6 August 2005| accessdate =26 July 2006 }}</ref> On 10 September 1944, the [[393d Bomb Squadron|393rd Bomb Squadron]], a [[B-29 Superfortress]] unit, arrived at Wendover from the [[504th Bombardment Group]]   (Very Heavy) at [[Fairmont, Nebraska|Fairmont Army Air Base]], [[Nebraska]], where it had been in group training since 12 March. When its parent group deployed to the [[Mariana Islands]] in early November 1944, the squadron was assigned directly to the [[Second Air Force]] until creation of the 509th Composite Group. <ref name="509timeline"/> Originally consisting of twenty-one crews, fifteen were selected to continue training and were organized into three [[flight (military unit)|flights]] of five crews, lettered A, B, and C.  . 

The 320th Troop Carrier Squadron, the other flying unit of the 509th, came into being because of the highly secret work of the group. The organization that was to become the 509th required its own transports for the movement of both personnel and materiel, resulting in creation of an ad hoc unit nicknamed "The [[Green Hornet]] Line". <ref name="509timeline">{{cite web | url = http://www.mphpa.org/classic/CG/CG_09C.htm| title = 509th Timeline: Inception to Hiroshima| publisher=The Atomic Heritage Foundation| accessdate =5 May 2007}}</ref><ref name="ipms">{{cite web | url = http://www.cybermodeler.com/history/silverpl/silverpl.shtml| title = Silverplate: the Aircraft of the Manhattan Project| publisher=Cybermodeler.com| accessdate =29 July 2006 }}</ref> Crews for this unit were acquired from the six 393rd crews not selected to continue B-29 training, some of whom chose to remain with the 509th rather than be assigned to a replacement pool of the Second Air Force. They began using [[Curtiss C-46 Commando]]s and [[C-47 Skytrain]]s already at Wendover, and after November 1944 flew five acquired [[C-54 Skymaster]]s.{{sfn|Krauss|Krauss|2005|p=1}} The 320th Troop Carrier was formally activated at the same time as the group. <ref name="509offhist" /> . 

Other support units were activated at Wendover from personnel already present and working with its Project W-47, which was later superseded by [[Project Alberta]], or in the 216th Base Unit, both of which were affiliated with the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Project Y]]. The 390th Air Service Group was created as the command echelon for the 603rd Air Engineering Squadron, the 1027th Air Material squadron, and its own Air Base Support Squadron, but as these units became independent operationally, acted as the basic support unit for the entire 509th Composite Group in providing quarters, rations, medical care, postal service and other basic support functions. The 603rd Air Engineering Squadron was unique in that it provided depot-level B-29 maintenance in the field, obviating the necessity of sending aircraft back to the United States for major repairs. The 603rd made a number of modifications to the first contract order of [[Silverplate]] B-29s that were later incorporated as specifications for the combat models.  . 

The 393rd Bomb Squadron began replacement of its original B-29s with modified Silverplate aircraft with the delivery of three new B-29s in mid-October 1944. <ref name="ipms" /> These aircraft had extensive bomb bay modifications and a "weaponeer" station installed, but initial training operations identified numerous other modifications necessary to the mission, particularly in reducing the overall weight of the aircraft to offset the heavy loads it would be required to carry. Five more Silverplates were delivered in November and six in December, giving the group 14 for its training operations. In January and February 1945, 10 of the 15 crews under the command of the Group S-3 (operations officer) were assigned temporary duty at [[Batista Field]], [[San Antonio de los Baños, Cuba]], where they trained in long-range over-water navigation. <ref name="uwash">{{cite web | url = http://www.uwosh.edu/faculty_staff/earns/olivi.html| title = Reflections From Above: An American pilot's perspective on the mission which dropped the atomic bomb on Nagasaki| publisher=University of Washington| accessdate =30 July 2006 }}</ref> .

On 6 March 1945, the 1st Ordnance Squadron (Special, Aviation) was activated at Wendover, again from Army Air Forces personnel on hand or already at Los Alamos, and concurrent with the activation of [[Project Alberta]]. Its purpose was to provide trained personnel and special equipment to the group to enable it to assemble atomic weapons at its operating base, thereby allowing the weapons to be transported more safely in their component parts. A rigorous candidate selection process was used to recruit personnel, with reportedly an 80% "washout" rate, and those made a part of the unit were not permitted transfer until the end of the war, nor were they allowed to travel without escorts from [[Military Intelligence]] units. <ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZYGdgRMiPFEC&pg=PA71 |pages=71, 74 |title=Five days in August: how World War II became a nuclear war |last=Gordin |first=Michael D. |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2007 |isbn=0691128189}}</ref> . 

With the addition of the 1st Ordnance Squadron to its roster, the 509th Composite Group had an authorized strength of 225 officers and 1,542 enlisted men, almost all of whom deployed to Tinian. The 320th Troop Carrier Squadron did not officially deploy but kept its base of operations at Wendover. In addition to its authorized strength, the 509th had attached to it on Tinian 51 civilian and military personnel of [[Project Alberta]],{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=25}} known as the 1st Technical Detachment.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|p=706}} There were two representatives from Washington, D.C., [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Thomas Farrell (general)|Thomas Farrell]], the deputy commander of the Manhattan Project, and [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[William R.

Parsons]], the commander of Project Alberta, they became known as the "Tinian Joint Chiefs".{{sfn|Christman|1998|p=176}} . 

The 509th began replacement of its 14 training Silverplates in February 1945 by transferring four to the 216th Base Unit. In April they began receiving Silverplates of the third modification increment and the remaining ten training B-29s were placed in storage. Each bombardier completed at least 50 practice drops of inert [[pumpkin bomb]]s and Tibbets declared his group combat-ready. <ref name="ready">{{cite web | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/9.pdf|format=PDF| title = Minutes of 3rd Target Committee Meeting 28&nbsp;May&nbsp;1945| publisher=National Archives| accessdate =9 August 2006}}</ref>  Preparation for Overseas Movement (POM) began in April.  . 

===Choice of targets===. 
[[File:Atomic bomb 1945 mission map.svg|thumb|300px|The mission runs of August 6 and August 9, with Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and [[Kokura]] (the original target for August 9) displayed.]]
At the request of [[General of the Army]] [[George Marshall]], the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Chief of Staff of the Army]], asked Groves to nominate specific targets for bombing, subject to approval by himself and [[Secretary of War]] [[Henry L. Stimson]]. Groves formed a Target Committee in April 1945 chaired by himself, that included his deputy, [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Thomas Farrell (general)|Thomas Farrell]]; one of his staff, [[Major]] John A. Derry; [[Colonel]] William P. Fisher, Joyce C. Stearns and [[David M. Dennison]] from the USAAF; and scientists [[John von Neumann]], [[Robert R. Wilson]] and [[William George Penney, Baron Penney|William C. Penney]] from the Manhattan Project. The Target Committee met on 27 April; at Los Alamos on 10 May, where it was able to talk to the scientists and technicians there; and finally in Washington on 28 May, where it was briefed by [[Colonel]] [[Paul Tibbets]] and [[Commander]] [[Frederick L. Ashworth]], and the Manhattan Project's scientific advisor, [[Richard C. Tolman]].{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=528–529}} . 

The Target Committee nominated four targets: [[Kokura]], the site of one of Japan's largest munitions plants; [[Hiroshima]], an embarkation port and industrial center that was the site of a major military headquarters; [[Niigata (city)|Niigata]], a port with industrial facilities including steel and aluminium plants and an oil refinery; and [[Kyoto]], a major industrial center. The target selection was subject to the following criteria:
* The target was larger than {{convert|3|mi}} in diameter and was an important target in a large urban area. 
* The blast would create effective damage. 
* The target was unlikely to be attacked by August 1945. "Any small and strictly military objective should be located in a much larger area subject to blast damage in order to avoid undue risks of the weapon being lost due to bad placing of the bomb."<ref name="targetcommittee" /> . 

These cities were largely untouched during the nightly bombing raids and the Army Air Force agreed to leave them off the target list so accurate assessment of the weapon could be made. Hiroshima was described as "an important army depot and port of embarkation in the middle of an urban industrial area. It is a good radar target and it is such a size that a large part of the city could be extensively damaged. There are adjacent hills which are likely to produce a focusing effect which would considerably increase the blast damage. Due to rivers it is not a good [[Incendiary device|incendiary]] target."<ref name="targetcommittee" /> The U.S. had previously dropped leaflets warning civilians of air raids on 35 Japanese cities, including Hiroshima and Nagasaki,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol46no3/article07.html |title=The Information War in the Pacific, 1945}}</ref> but not of the atomic bomb as such. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0805-24.htm |title=The Myths of Hiroshima |publisher=Commondreams.org |date= |accessdate=25 March 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doug-long.com/letter.htm |title=Hiroshima: Historians' Letter to the Smithsonian |publisher=Doug-long.com |date= |accessdate=25 March 2009}}</ref> . 

The goal of the weapon was to convince Japan to surrender unconditionally in accordance with the terms of the [[Potsdam Declaration]]. The Target Committee stated that "It was agreed that psychological factors in the target selection were of great importance. Two aspects of this are (1) obtaining the greatest psychological effect against Japan and (2) making the initial use sufficiently spectacular for the importance of the weapon to be internationally recognized when publicity on it is released. Kyoto had the advantage of being an important center for military industry, as well an intellectual center and hence better able to appreciate the significance of the weapon. The [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Emperor's palace]] in Tokyo has a greater fame than any other target but is of least strategic value."<ref name="targetcommittee">{{cite web| title=Atomic Bomb: Decision—Target Committee, 10–11 May 1945 | url=http://www.dannen.com/decision/targets.html | accessdate= 6 August 2005 }}</ref> . 

[[Edwin O. Reischauer]] a Japan expert for the [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Intelligence Service]], was incorrectly said to have prevented the bombing of Kyoto. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dannen.com/decision/targets.html |title=A-bomb targets/decision-making record (1945) |publisher=Dannen.com |accessdate=25 March 2009}}</ref> In his autobiography, Reischauer specifically refuted this claim:
{{quote|...the only person deserving credit for saving Kyoto from destruction is Henry L. Stimson, the Secretary of War at the time, who had known and admired Kyoto ever since his honeymoon there several decades earlier.{{sfn|Reischauer|1986|p=101}} }} On 25 July, [[Nagasaki]] was put on the target list in place of Kyoto.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=530}} . 

===Potsdam ultimatum===. 
On 26 July, Allied leaders issued the [[Potsdam Declaration]] outlining terms of surrender for Japan. It was presented as an [[ultimatum]] and stated that without a surrender, the Allies would attack Japan, resulting in "the inevitable and complete destruction of the Japanese armed forces and just as inevitably the utter devastation of the Japanese homeland". The atomic bomb was not mentioned in the communiqué. On 28 July Japanese papers reported that the declaration had been rejected by the Japanese government. That afternoon, Prime Minister [[Kantarō Suzuki]] declared at a press conference that the Potsdam Declaration was no more than a rehash (''yakinaoshi'') of the [[Cairo Declaration]] and that the government intended to ignore it (''[[mokusatsu]]'', "kill by silence"). <ref>{{harvnb|Frank|1999|pp=233–234}}. The meaning of ''mokusatsu'' can fall anywhere in the range of "ignore" to "treat with contempt". </ref> The statement was taken by both Japanese and foreign papers as a clear rejection of the declaration. [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] [[Hirohito]], who was waiting for a Soviet reply to non-committal Japanese peace feelers, made no move to change the government position.{{sfn|Bix|1996|p=290}} . 

Under the 1943 [[Quebec Agreement]] with the United Kingdom, the United States had agreed that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent. In June 1945 the head of the [[British Joint Staff Mission]], [[Field Marshal]] Sir [[Henry Maitland Wilson]], agreed that the use of nuclear weapons against Japan would be officially recorded as a decision of the [[Combined Policy Committee]]. <ref>{{harvnb|Gowing|1964|p=372}}. </ref> At Potsdam, Truman agreed to a request from the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], [[Winston Churchill]], that Britain be represented when the atomic bomb was dropped. William Penney and [[Group Captain]] [[Leonard Cheshire]] were sent to Tinian, but found that Major General [[Curtis LeMay]] would not let them accompany the mission. All they could do was send a strongly worded signal back to Wilson.{{sfn|Thomas|Morgan-Witts|1977|pp=326, 356, 370}} . 

==Hiroshima==. 
===Hiroshima during World War II===. 
[[File:B-29 Enola Gay w Crews.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The ''[[Enola Gay]]'' dropped the "[[Little Boy]]" atomic bomb on Hiroshima. In this photograph are five of the ship's ground crew with mission commander [[Paul Tibbets]] in the center.]]
At the time of its bombing, Hiroshima was a city of both industrial and military significance. A number of military camps were located nearby, including the headquarters of [[Field Marshal]] [[Shunroku Hata]]'s 2nd General Army Headquarters, which commanded the defense of all of southern Japan.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=64–65, 163}} His command consisted of some 400,000 men, most of whom were on Kyushu where an Allied invasion was correctly expected.{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|Wenger|1995|p=41}} Also present in Hiroshima was the headquarters of the [[Fifty-Ninth Army (Japan)|Fifty-Ninth Army]], and most of the [[IJA 224th Division|224th Division]], a recently formed mobile unit.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=70, 163}} The city's air defenses comprised five batteries of {{convert|7|cm|in|adj=on}} and {{convert|8|cm|in|adj=on}} anti-aircraft guns.{{sfn|Zaloga|Noon|2010|p=59}} . 

Hiroshima was a minor supply and logistics base for the Japanese military. The city was a communications center, a storage point, and an assembly area for troops. It was one of several Japanese cities left deliberately untouched by American bombing, allowing a pristine environment to measure the damage caused by the atomic bomb.{{sfn|Thomas |Morgan-Witts|1977|pp=222–225}} . 

The center of the city contained several [[reinforced concrete]] buildings and lighter structures. Outside the center, the area was congested by a dense collection of small wooden workshops set among Japanese houses. A few larger industrial plants lay near the outskirts of the city. The houses were constructed of wood with tile roofs, and many of the industrial buildings were also built around wood frames. The city as a whole was highly susceptible to fire damage.{{sfn|Thomas |Morgan-Witts|1977|p=38}} . 

The population of Hiroshima had reached a peak of over 381,000 earlier in the war, but prior to the atomic bombing the population had steadily decreased because of a [[Evacuations of civilians in Japan during World War II|systematic evacuation ordered by the Japanese government]]. At the time of the attack, the population was approximately 340,000–350,000. <ref name="rerf-deaths">{{cite web |url = http://www.rerf.or.jp/general/qa_e/qa1.html |title = Frequently Asked Questions #1

===The bombing===. 
Hiroshima was the primary target of the first nuclear bombing mission on 6 August, with Kokura and Nagasaki as alternative targets. The 393d Bombardment Squadron B-29 ''[[Enola Gay]]'', piloted by Tibbets, took off from North Field airbase on [[Tinian]], about six hours flight time from Japan. The ''Enola Gay'' (named after Tibbets' mother) was accompanied by two other B-29s. ''[[The Great Artiste]]'', commanded by [[Major]] [[Charles W. Sweeney]], carried instrumentation, and a then-nameless aircraft later called ''[[Necessary Evil (B-29)|Necessary Evil]]'', commanded by Captain George Marquardt, served as the photography aircraft. <ref name="SM15">{{cite web | url = http://www.childrenofthemanhattanproject.org/CG/CG_09C1.htm| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061009095411/http://www.childrenofthemanhattanproject.org/CG/CG_09C1.htm| archivedate = 9 October 2006| title = Timeline #2- the 509th; The Hiroshima Mission | publisher=Children of the Manhattan Project| accessdate = 26 July 2006}}</ref> .

After leaving Tinian the aircraft made their way separately to [[Iwo Jima]] where they rendezvoused at {{convert|2440|m|ft|sp=us}} and set course for Japan. The aircraft arrived over the target in clear visibility at {{convert|9855|m|ft|sp=us}}. Parsons, who was in command of the mission, armed the bomb during the flight to minimize the risks during takeoff. His assistant, [[Second Lieutenant]] [[Morris Jeppson]], removed the safety devices 30 minutes before reaching the target area. <ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web | url = http://www.mphpa.org/classic/HISTORY/H-07L1.htm| title = Timeline #2- the 509th; The Hiroshima Mission | work=|publisher=The Atomic Heritage Foundation|accessdate = 5 May 2007}}</ref> . 

[[File:Hirgrnd1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Seizo Yamada's ground level photo taken from approximately 7&nbsp;km northeast of Hiroshima.]]
About an hour before the bombing, Japanese early warning radar detected the approach of some American aircraft headed for the southern part of Japan. An alert was given and radio broadcasting stopped in many cities, among them Hiroshima. At nearly 08:00, the radar operator in Hiroshima determined that the number of planes coming in was very small—probably not more than three—and the air raid alert was lifted. To conserve fuel and aircraft, the Japanese had decided not to intercept small formations. The normal radio broadcast warning was given to the people that it might be advisable to go to air-raid shelters if B-29s were actually sighted. However a reconnaissance mission was assumed because at 07:31 the first B29 to fly over Hiroshima at {{convert|32000|ft|m|sp=us}} had been the weather observation aircraft ''Straight Flush'' that sent a morse code message to the ''Enola Gay'' indicating that the weather was good over the primary target. Because it then turned out to sea, the 'all clear' was sounded in the city. At 08:09 Colonel Tibbets started his bomb run and handed control over to his bombardier.{{sfn|Allen|1969|p=2566}} . 

The release at 08:15 (Hiroshima time) went as planned, and the [[gravity bomb]] known as "Little Boy", a [[gun-type fission weapon]] with {{convert|60|kg|lb}} of [[uranium-235]], took 43 seconds to fall from the aircraft flying at {{convert|31060|ft|m|sp=us}} to the predetermined detonation height about {{convert|1900|ft|m|sp=us}} above the city. The ''Enola Gay'' traveled {{convert|11.5|mi}} before it felt the shock waves from the blast. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/manhattan/hiroshima.htm| title=The Atomic Bombing of Hiroshima, Aug&nbsp;6, 1945 |publisher=www.cfo.doe.gov |date= |accessdate=25 June 2010}}</ref> .

===Japanese realization of the bombing===. 
{{double image|right|AtomicEffects-p7a.jpg|200|AtomicEffects-p7b.jpg|200|Hiroshima before the bombing.|Hiroshima after the bombing.}}
The Tokyo control operator of [[NHK|the Broadcasting Corporation of Japan]] noticed that the Hiroshima station had gone off the air. He tried to re-establish his program by using another telephone line, but it too had failed. <ref name="No High Ground">{{harvnb|Knebel|Bailey|1960|p=175-201}}</ref> About 20 minutes later the Tokyo railroad telegraph center realized that the main line telegraph had stopped working just north of Hiroshima. From some small railway stops within {{convert|16|km}} of the city came unofficial and confused reports of a terrible explosion in Hiroshima. All these reports were transmitted to the headquarters of the [[Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office|Imperial Japanese Army General Staff]].  . 

Military bases repeatedly tried to call the Army Control Station in Hiroshima. The complete silence from that city puzzled the men at headquarters; they knew that no large enemy raid had occurred and that no sizeable store of explosives was in Hiroshima at that time. A young officer of the Japanese General Staff was instructed to fly immediately to Hiroshima, to land, survey the damage, and return to Tokyo with reliable information for the staff. It was generally felt at headquarters that nothing serious had taken place and that the explosion was just a rumor.  . 

The staff officer went to the airport and took off for the southwest. After flying for about three hours, while still nearly {{convert|160|km}} from Hiroshima, he and his pilot saw a great cloud of smoke from the bomb. In the bright afternoon, the remains of Hiroshima were burning. Their plane soon reached the city, around which they circled in disbelief. A great scar on the land still burning and covered by a heavy cloud of smoke was all that was left. They landed south of the city, and the staff officer, after reporting to Tokyo, immediately began to organize relief measures.  . 

By 8 August 1945, newspapers in the U.S. were reporting that broadcasts from Radio Tokyo had described the destruction observed in Hiroshima. "Practically all living things, human and animal, were literally seared to death", Japanese radio announcers said in a broadcast received by Allied sources. <ref name="Fulton Sun Retrospective">{{cite web| title=Fulton Sun Retrospective | url=http://www.fultonsun.com/articles/2005/08/07/news/146news11.txt|accessdate=8 July 2007 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> .

After the Hiroshima bombing, Truman issued a statement announcing the use of the new weapon. He stated, "We may be grateful to Providence" that the [[German atomic bomb project]] had failed, and that the United States and its allies had "spent two billion dollars on the greatest scientific gamble in history-and won." Truman then warned Japan: {{quote|If they do not now accept our terms, they may expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth.

The Japanese government still did not react to the [[Potsdam Declaration]]. Emperor Hirohito, the government, and the war council were considering four conditions for surrender: the preservation of the ''[[kokutai]]'' (Imperial institution and national [[polity]]), assumption by the Imperial Headquarters of responsibility for disarmament and demobilization, no occupation of the [[Japanese Archipelago|Japanese Home Islands]], Korea, or [[Formosa]], and delegation of the punishment of war criminals to the Japanese government. <ref>{{harvnb|Bix|1996|p=512}}</ref> . 

The Soviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] had informed Tokyo of the Soviet Union's unilateral abrogation of the [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact]] on 5 April. At two minutes past midnight on 9 August, [[Japan Standard Time|Tokyo time]], Soviet infantry, armor, and air forces had launched the [[Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation]]. Four hours later, word reached Tokyo that the Soviet Union had declared war on Japan. The senior leadership of the Japanese Army began preparations to impose [[martial law]] on the nation, with the support of Minister of War [[Korechika Anami]], in order to stop anyone attempting to make peace.  .

===Nagasaki during World War II===. 
[[File:Bocks-Car-enlisted-flight-crew.png|thumb|250px|The ''[[Bockscar]]'' and its crew, who dropped the [[Fat Man]] atomic bomb on Nagasaki.]]
The city of [[Nagasaki]] had been one of the largest [[sea port]]s in southern Japan and was of great wartime importance because of its wide-ranging industrial activity, including the production of [[wikt:ordnance|ordnance]], ships, military equipment, and other war materials.  . 

In contrast to many modern aspects of Hiroshima, almost all of the buildings were of old-fashioned Japanese construction, consisting of wood or wood-frame buildings with wood walls (with or without plaster) and tile roofs. Many of the smaller industries and business establishments were also situated in buildings of wood or other materials not designed to withstand explosions. Nagasaki had been permitted to grow for many years without conforming to any definite city zoning plan; residences were erected adjacent to factory buildings and to each other almost as closely as possible throughout the entire industrial valley.  . 

Nagasaki had never been subjected to large-scale bombing prior to the explosion of a nuclear weapon there. On August 1, 1945, however, a number of conventional high-explosive bombs were dropped on the city. A few hit in the shipyards and dock areas in the southwest portion of the city, several hit the [[Mitsubishi]] Steel and Arms Works, and six bombs landed at the [[Nagasaki University|Nagasaki Medical School]] and Hospital, with three direct hits on buildings there. While the damage from these bombs was relatively small, it created considerable concern in Nagasaki and many people—principally school children—were evacuated to rural areas for safety, thus reducing the population in the city at the time of the nuclear attack. By early August the city was defended by four batteries of {{convert|7|cm|in}} anti-aircraft guns and two searchlight batteries.{{sfn|Zaloga|Noon|2010|p=59}} . 

To the north of Nagasaki there was a camp holding [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] prisoners of war, some of whom were working in the coal mines and only found out about the bombing when they came to the surface.  . 

===The bombing===. 
Responsibility for the timing of the second bombing was delegated to Tibbets. Scheduled for 11 August against Kokura, the raid was moved earlier by two days to avoid a five day period of bad weather forecast to begin on 10 August.{{sfn|Sherwin||2003|pp=233–23}} Three bomb pre-assemblies had been transported to Tinian, labeled F-31, F-32, and F-33 on their exteriors. On 8 August, a dress rehearsal was conducted off Tinian by Sweeney using ''[[Bockscar]]'' as the drop airplane. Assembly F-33 was expended testing the components and F-31 was designated for the August 9 mission.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=114}} .

On the morning of 9 August 1945, the B-29 Superfortress ''[[Bockscar]]''<!-- yes, it is "Bockscar" not "Bock's Car". This is ''not'' a typo! -->, flown by Sweeney's crew, carried Fat Man, with Kokura as the primary target and Nagasaki the secondary target. The mission plan for the second attack was nearly identical to that of the Hiroshima mission, with two B-29s flying an hour ahead as weather scouts and two additional B-29s in Sweeney's flight for instrumentation and photographic support of the mission. Sweeney took off with his weapon already armed but with the electrical safety plugs still engaged. <ref name="SM16">{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | year = | url = http://www.mphpa.org/classic/HISTORY/H-07m1.htm| title = Timeline #3- the 509th; The Nagasaki Mission| publisher=The Atomic Heritage Foundation| accessdate = 5 May 2007}}</ref> . 

This time Penney and Cheshire were allowed to accompany the mission, flying as observers on the third plane, [[Big Stink (B-29)|''Big Stink'']], which flown by the group's Operations Officer, Lieutenant Colonel James I. Hopkins, Jr. Observers aboard the weather planes reported both targets clear. When Sweeney's aircraft arrived at the assembly point for his flight off the coast of Japan, ''Big Stink'', failed to make the rendezvous. ''Bockscar''<!-- yes, it is "Bockscar" not "Bock's Car". This is ''not'' a typo! --> and the instrumentation plane circled for 40 minutes without locating Hopkins. Already 30 minutes behind schedule, Sweeney decided to fly on without Hopkins. <ref name="SM16" /> . 

By the time they reached Kokura a half hour later, a 70% cloud cover had obscured the city, prohibiting the visual attack required by orders. After three runs over the city, and with fuel running low because a transfer pump on a reserve tank had failed before take-off, they headed for their secondary target, Nagasaki. <ref name="SM16" /> Fuel consumption calculations made en route indicated that ''Bockscar'' had insufficient fuel to reach [[Iwo Jima]] and would be forced to divert to [[Okinawa]]. After initially deciding that if Nagasaki were obscured on their arrival the crew would carry the bomb to Okinawa and dispose of it in the ocean if necessary, the weaponeer, Navy [[Commander]] Frederick Ashworth, decided that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured. <ref name="Spitzer">{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | year = | url = http://www.mphpa.org/classic/COLLECTIONS/CG-ASPI/01/Pages/CGP-ASPI-025.htm| title = Spitzer Personal Diary Page 25 (CGP-ASPI-025)| work=| publisher=The Atomic Heritage Foundation| accessdate = 5 May 2007}}</ref> . 

At about 07:50 Japanese time, an air raid alert was sounded in Nagasaki, but the "all clear" signal was given at 08:30. When only two B-29 Superfortresses were sighted at 10:53, the Japanese apparently assumed that the planes were only on reconnaissance and no further alarm was given.  . 

[[File:Nagasaki 1945 - Before and after (adjusted).jpg|thumb|left|Nagasaki before and after bombing.]]
A few minutes later at 11:00, ''[[The Great Artiste]]'', the support B-29 flown by Captain [[Frederick C. Bock]], dropped instruments attached to three parachutes. These instruments also contained an unsigned letter to Professor [[Ryokichi Sagane]], a [[nuclear physicist]] at the [[University of Tokyo]] who studied with three of the scientists responsible for the atomic bomb at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], urging him to tell the public about the danger involved with these [[weapons of mass destruction]]. The messages were found by military authorities but not turned over to Sagane until a month later. <ref>{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=295}}</ref> In 1949, one of the authors of the letter, [[Luis Alvarez]], met with Sagane and signed the document. <ref name="Stories from Riken">{{cite web| url = http://www.riken.jp/r-world/info/release/riken88/text/image/pdf/no09e.pdf| title = Stories from Riken | accessdate=30 April 2007|format=PDF}}</ref> . 

At 11:01, a last minute break in the clouds over Nagasaki allowed ''Bockscar'''s bombardier, Captain [[Kermit Beahan]], to visually sight the target as ordered. The Fat Man weapon, containing a core of about {{convert|6.4|kg}} of [[Plutonium]], was dropped over the city's industrial valley. It exploded 43 seconds later at {{convert|469|m}} above the ground halfway between the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works in the south and the Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works (Torpedo Works) in the north. This was nearly {{convert|3|km}} northwest of the planned hypocenter; the blast was confined to the [[Urakami|Urakami Valley]] and a major portion of the city was protected by the intervening hills. <ref>{{harvnb|Wainstock|1996|p=92}}</ref> The resulting explosion had a blast yield equivalent to {{convert|21|ktonTNT}}. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/thewar/detail_5234.htm |title=''The Atomic Bomb'' |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=4 November 2010}}</ref> The explosion generated heat estimated at {{convert|3900|C}} and winds that were estimated at {{convert|1005|km/h|abbr=on}}.  .

==Plans for more atomic attacks on Japan==. 
Groves expected to have another atomic bomb ready for use on 19 August, with three more in September and a further three in October. <ref name="Generals">{{cite web |title = The Atomic Bomb and the End of World War II, A Collection of Primary Sources| publisher=[[George Washington University]]| date = 13 August 1945| work=National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 162 | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/72.pdf}}</ref> On 10 August, he sent a memorandum to Marshall in which he wrote that "the next bomb . . should be ready for delivery on the first suitable weather after 17 or 18 August." On the same day, Marshall endorsed the memo with the comment, "It is not to be released over Japan without express authority from the President."<ref name="Generals"/> . 

There was already discussion in the War Department about conserving the bombs in production until Operation Downfall had begun. "The problem now [13 August] is whether or not, assuming the Japanese do not capitulate, to continue dropping them every time one is made and shipped out there or whether to hold them . . . and then pour them all on in a reasonably short time. Not all in one day, but over a short period. And that also takes into consideration the target that we are after. In other words, should we not concentrate on targets that will be of the greatest assistance to an invasion rather than industry, morale, psychology, and the like? Nearer the tactical use rather than other use."<ref name="Generals"/> . 

Two more Fat Man assemblies were readied. The [[Demon core|third core]] was scheduled to leave [[Kirtland Field]] for Tinian on 12 August,{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=396–397}} and Tibbets was ordered by Major General [[Curtis LeMay]] to return to Utah to collect it. <ref name="PaulTibbets StudsTerkel">{{cite web| url=  http://www.avweb.com/news/profiles/PaulTibbets_StudsTerkel_EnolaGayInterview_2002_196499-1.html| title=  Paul Tibbets Interview| last=  Terkel| first=  Studs

==Surrender of Japan and subsequent occupation==. 
{{Main|Surrender of Japan|Occupation of Japan}} . 

Until August 9, the war council had still insisted on its four conditions for surrender. On that day Hirohito ordered [[Kōichi Kido|Kido]] to "quickly control the situation ... because the Soviet Union has declared war against us." He then held an Imperial conference during which he authorized minister [[Shigenori Tōgō|Tōgō]] to notify the Allies that Japan would accept their terms on one condition, that the declaration "does not compromise any demand which prejudices the prerogatives of His Majesty as a Sovereign ruler."<ref>''Kido Koichi nikki'',Tokyo, Daigaku Shuppankai, 1966, p.1223</ref> . 

On August 10, the Japanese government presented a letter of protest for the atomic bombings to the government of the United States via the government of Switzerland. <ref>[http://yantake-web.hp.infoseek.co.jp/page1.html The Atomic Bombing of Japan Bombing Hiroshima & Nagasaki]{{Self-published inline|date=March 2010}}</ref> On August 12, the Emperor informed the imperial family of his decision to surrender. One of his uncles, [[Prince Asaka]], then asked whether the war would be continued if the ''[[kokutai]]'' could not be preserved. Hirohito simply replied "of course."<ref>Terasaki Hidenari, ''Shôwa tennô dokuhakuroku'', 1991, p.129</ref> As the Allied terms seemed to leave intact the principle of the preservation of the Throne, Hirohito recorded on August 14 his [[Gyokuon-hōsō|capitulation announcement]] which was broadcast to the Japanese nation the next day despite a short [[Kyūjō Incident|rebellion]] by militarists opposed to the surrender.  . 

In his declaration, Hirohito referred to the atomic bombings:
{{quote|Moreover, the enemy now possesses a new and terrible weapon with the power to destroy many innocent lives and do incalculable damage. Should we continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.  . 

Such being the case, how are We to save the millions of Our subjects, or to atone Ourselves before the hallowed spirits of Our Imperial Ancestors? This is the reason why We have ordered the acceptance of the provisions of the Joint Declaration of the Powers.}} . 

In his "Rescript to the soldiers and sailors" delivered on August 17, he stressed the impact of the Soviet invasion and his decision to surrender, omitting any mention of the bombs.  . 

During the year after the bombing, approximately 40,000 U.S. troops occupied Hiroshima, while Nagasaki was occupied by 27,000 troops.  . 

==Depiction, public response and censorship==.

McGovern and Harry Mimura]]
During the war "annihilationist and exterminationalist rhetoric" was tolerated at all levels of U.S. society; according to the UK embassy in Washington the Americans regarded the Japanese as "a nameless mass of vermin". <ref name="Gordon Martel p.231">Gordon Martel, "The World War Two reader" p.231</ref> Caricatures depicting Japanese as less than human, e.g. monkeys, were common. <ref name="Gordon Martel p.231"/> A 1944 [[opinion poll]] that asked what should be done with Japan found that 13% of the U.S. public were in favor of "killing off" all Japanese: men, women, and children. <ref>{{harvnb|Bagby|1999|p=135]}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Feraru|1950|p=101}}</ref> . 

News of the atomic bombing was greeted enthusiastically in the U.S.; a poll in [[Fortune magazine|''Fortune'' magazine]] in late 1945 showed a significant minority of Americans wishing that more atomic bombs could have been dropped on Japan. <ref name="Walter L. Hixson p.239">Walter L. Hixson, "The American Experience in World War II: The atomic bomb in history and memory, p.239"</ref> The initial positive response was supported by the imagery presented to the public (mainly the powerful mushroom cloud) and the censorship of photographs that showed corpses of people incinerated by the blast as well as photos of maimed survivors. <ref name="Walter L. Hixson p.239"/> As an example, a member of the U.S. [[Strategic Bombing Survey]], Lieutenant Daniel McGovern, used a film crew to document the results. The film crew's work resulted in a three-hour documentary entitled ''The Effects of the Atomic Bombs Against Hiroshima and Nagasaki''. The documentary included images from hospitals showing the human effects of the bomb; it showed burned out buildings and cars, and rows of skulls and bones on the ground. When sent to the U.S., it was mentioned widely in the U.S. press, then quietly suppressed and never shown. It was classified "top secret" for the next 22 years. <ref>{{harvnb|Moore|1995|p=73}}</ref> The total of {{convert|90000|ft}} of footage filmed by Lieutenant Daniel McGovern's cameramen had not been fully aired {{as of|2009}}. However, according to Greg Mitchell, with the 2004 documentary film [[Original Child Bomb]], a small part of that footage managed to reach part of the American public "in the unflinching and powerful form its creators intended". <ref name="Greg Mitchell">{{cite news |title=The Great Hiroshima Cover-Up |author=Greg Mitchell |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/greg-mitchell/for-64th-anniversary-the_b_252752.html |newspaper=Huffington Post |date= 7 August 2009|accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref> . 

Imagery of the atomic bombings was suppressed in Japan during the occupation<ref>Steve Edwards, Photography: a very short introduction, p.38</ref> although some Japanese magazines had managed to publish images before the Allied occupation troops took control. The Allied occupation forces enforced censorship on anything "that might, directly or by inference, disturb public tranquility", and pictures of the effects on people on the ground were deemed inflammatory. A likely reason for the banning was that the images depicting burn victims and funeral pyres were similar to the widely circulated images taken in liberated Nazi concentration camps. <ref>Marianna Torgovnick, "The war complex: World War II in our time", p.15</ref> . 

Motion picture company Nippon Eigasha started sending cameramen to Nagasaki and Hiroshima in September 1945. On 24 October 1945 a US military policeman stopped a Nippon Eigasha cameraman from continuing to film in Nagasaki. All Nippon Eigasha's reels were then confiscated by the American authorities. These reels were in turn requested by the Japanese government, declassified, and saved from oblivion. Some black-and-white motion pictures were released and shown for the first time to Japanese and American audiences in the years from 1968 to 1970. <ref name="Greg Mitchell"/> . 

==Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission==. 
In the spring of 1948, the [[Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission]] (ABCC) was established in accordance with a presidential directive from [[Harry S. Truman]] to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]–[[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] to conduct investigations of the late effects of radiation among the survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  . 

Among the casualties were found many unintended victims, including Allied [[POW]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powresearch.jp/en/pdf_e/powlist/fukuoka/fukuoka_14b_nagasaki_e_001.pdf |title=POW website Research Network Japan |date= |accessdate=16 August 2011}}</ref> Korean and Chinese laborers, students from [[British Malaya|Malaya]] on scholarships, and some 3,200 [[Japanese American]] citizens. <ref>Forgotten Wars: Freedom and Revolution in Southeast Asia, Prologue:An Unending War, Christopher Bayly & Tim Harper, The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, pp. 3 ISBN 0674021533</ref> . 

One of the early studies conducted by the ABCC was on the outcome of pregnancies occurring in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and in a [[Controlling for a variable|control]] city, [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]] located {{convert|18|mi|km}} south from Hiroshima, in order to discern the conditions and outcomes related to radiation exposure.

===Double survivors===. 
People who suffered the effects of both bombings are known as ''nijū hibakusha'' in Japan. On 24 March 2009, the Japanese government officially recognized [[Tsutomu Yamaguchi]] (1916–2010) as a double ''hibakusha''. He was confirmed to be {{convert|3|km}} from ground zero in Hiroshima on a business trip when Little Boy was detonated. He was seriously burnt on his left side and spent the night in Hiroshima. He arrived at his home city of Nagasaki on 8 August, the day before Fat Man was dropped, and he was exposed to residual radiation while searching for his relatives. He was the first officially recognised survivor of both bombings. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Hiroshima-And-Nagasaki-Atomic-Bomb-Survivor-Recognised/Article/200903415247958?lpos=World_News_Second_World_News_Article_Teaser_Region_3&lid=ARTICLE_15247958_Hiroshima_And_Nagasaki_Atomic_Bomb_Survivor_Recognised |title=Japan Confirms First Double A-Bomb Survivor |publisher=News.sky.com |date= |accessdate=4 November 2010|unused_data=1}}</ref> He died on 4 January 2010, at the age of 93, after a battle with stomach cancer. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/01/06/japan.bomb.victim.dies/index.html |title=Man who survived two atom bombs dies |date=8 January 2010 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=8 January 2010}}</ref>

[[Image:A-Bomb Dome.jpg|thumb|Citizens of Hiroshima walk by the Hiroshima Peace Memorial, the closest building to have survived the city's atomic bombing.]] . 

The role of the bombings in [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]] and the U.S.'s ethical justification for them has been the subject of scholarly and popular debate for decades. J. Samuel Walker wrote in an April 2005 overview of recent historiography on the issue, "the controversy over the use of the bomb seems certain to continue." He wrote that "The fundamental issue that has divided scholars over a period of nearly four decades is whether the use of the bomb was necessary to achieve victory in the war in the Pacific on terms satisfactory to the United States."<ref name=Walker>{{harvnb|Walker|2005|p=334}}</ref> . 

Supporters of the bombings generally assert that they caused the Japanese surrender, preventing massive casualties on both sides in the planned invasion of Japan:  The national slogan was “One hundred million will die for the Emperor and Nation.”<ref name="invasion">Philip S. Jowett, Stephen Andrew (2002). "''[http://books.google.com/books?id=U_WsovcHDQoC&pg=PA23&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false The Japanese army 1931–45: 1942–45]''". Osprey Publishing. pp.23–24.

Those who oppose the bombings, among them many US military leaders as well as ex-president [[Herbert Hoover]], argue that it was simply an extension of the already fierce conventional bombing campaign. <ref>Ward Wilson. The Winning Weapon? Rethinking Nuclear Weapons in Light of Hiroshima. ''International Security'', Vol. 31, No. 4 (Spring 2007), pp. 162–179</ref> This, together with the sea blockade and the collapse of Germany (with its implications regarding redeployment), would also have led to a Japanese surrender – so the atomic bombings were militarily unnecessary. On the contrary, according to Kyoko Iriye Selden, "The most influential text is [[Harry Truman|Truman]]'s 1955 ''Memoirs'', which states that the atomic bomb probably saved half a million US lives— anticipated casualties in an Allied invasion of Japan planned for November. [[Henry L. Stimson|Stimson]] subsequently talked of saving one million US casualties, and [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] of saving one million American and half that number of British lives."<ref>Kyoko Iriye Selden (1990). "''[http://books.google.com/books?id=e-_FcL92fJkC&pg=&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false The Atomic bomb: voices from Hiroshima and Nagasaki]''". M.E. Sharpe. ISBN 087332773X</ref> . 

Scholars have pointed out various alternatives that could have ended the war just as quickly without an invasion, but these alternatives could have resulted in the deaths of many more Japanese. <ref>{{cite journal|title=The Decision to Use the Bomb: A Historiographical Update;|journal= Diplomatic History|issue= Volume 14, Issue 1| pages= 97–114|date= January 1990|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-7709.1990.tb00078.x|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7709.1990.tb00078.x|last1=Walker|first1=J.

As the United States dropped its atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, 1.6&nbsp;million [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|Soviet troops]] launched a surprise attack on the Japanese forces occupying eastern Asia. "The Soviet entry into the war played a much greater role than the atomic bombs in inducing Japan to surrender because it dashed any hope that Japan could terminate the war through Moscow's mediation", said Japanese historian [[Tsuyoshi Hasegawa]], whose recently published ''Racing the Enemy: Stalin, Truman, and the Surrender of Japan'' is based on recently declassified Soviet archives as well as U.S. and Japanese documents. <ref>[[Tsuyoshi Hasegawa]].

{{quote|... (b) that the dropping of atomic bombs as an act of hostilities was illegal under the rules of positive international law (taking both treaty law and customary law into consideration) then in force... (c) that the dropping of atomic bombs also constituted a wrongful act on the plane of municipal law, ascribable to the United States and its President, Mr. Harry S. Truman;
...The aerial bombardment with atomic bombs of the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was an illegal act of hostilities according to the rules of international law. It must be regarded as indiscriminate aerial bombardment of undefended cities, even if it were directed at military objectives only, inasmuch as it resulted in damage comparable to that caused by indiscriminate bombardment.}} .
