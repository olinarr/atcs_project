'''Nuclear winter''' is a hypothetical [[climate|climatic]] effect of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]].  It is theorized that detonating large numbers of [[nuclear weapons]] has a profound and severe effect on the climate causing cold weather and reduced sunlight for a period of months or even years, especially over [[fire|flammable]] targets such as [[city|cities]], where large amounts of [[smoke]] and [[soot]] would be ejected into the [[Earth]]'s [[stratosphere]].  . 

Similar climatic effects can be caused by [[comets]] or an [[asteroid impact]],<ref>{{cite journal |title=Comet Caused Nuclear Winter |journal=Discover |month=January |year=2005 |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2005/jan/comet-caused-nuclear-winter}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2004/05/63613|title=A Fiery Death for Dinosaurs?|author=Amit Asaravala|publisher=Wired}}</ref> also sometimes termed an [[impact winter]], or by a [[supervolcano]] eruption, known as a [[volcanic winter]]. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/628515.stm|title=Supervolcanoes could trigger global freeze|publisher=BBC | date=February 3, 2000}}</ref> . 

==Mechanism==. 
The nuclear winter scenario predicts that the huge fires caused by [[nuclear explosion]]s (from burning urban areas) would loft massive amounts of dense [[smoke]] from the fires, into the upper [[troposphere]] / [[stratosphere]]. At 10-15 kilometers (6–9 miles) above the Earth's surface, the absorption of sunlight would further heat the smoke, lifting some, or all of it, into the [[stratosphere]], to where the smoke would persist for years, with no rain to wash it out. This [[aerosol]] of particles would block out much of the [[sunlight|sun's light]] from reaching the surface, causing surface temperatures to drop drastically.  . 

===Aerosol removal timescale===. 
The exact timescale for how long this smoke remains, and thus how severely this smoke affects the climate once it reaches the [[stratosphere]], is dependent on both chemical and physical removal processes. The physical removal mechanisms affecting the timescale of smoke particle removal are how quickly the particles in the smoke [[coagulate]]<ref name="a.mpg.de">[http://www.atmosphere.mpg.de/enid/906c8d956939bb335e9b051e10f45223,0/2__Particles/-_Transformation_and_removal_296.html Transformation and removal] J. Gourdeau, LaMP Clermont-Ferrand, France, March 12, 2003</ref> and fall out of the atmosphere via  [[dry deposition]],<ref name="a.mpg.de"/> and to a slower degree, the time it takes for solar [[radiation pressure]] to move the particles to a lower level in the atmosphere. Whether by [[coagulation]] or [[radiation pressure]], once the particles are at this lower atmospheric level [[cloud seeding]] can begin, permitting [[precipitation]] to wash the smoke [[aerosol]] out of the atmosphere by the [[wet deposition]] mechanism. The chemical processes that affect the removal are dependant on the ability of [[atmospheric chemistry]] to [[oxidize]] the smoke, via reactions with oxidative species such as [[ozone]] and [[nitrogen oxides]],  both of which are found at all levels of the atmosphere. <ref>[http://www.atmosphere.mpg.de/enid/906c8d956939bb335e9b051e10f45223,0/4__Gases_in_the_atmosphere/-_Distribution___concentration__2__3tg.html Distribution & concentration (2)] Dr. Elmar Uherek - Max Planck Institute for Chemistry Mainz, April 6, 2004</ref> Historical data on residence times of aerosols, albeit a different mixture of aerosols, from [[megavolcano]] eruptions appear to be in the 1-2 year time scale. <ref>[http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/how_volcanoes_work/climate_effects.html How Volcanoes Work - volcano climate effects]</ref> [[Aerosol]] atmosphere interactions are still poorly understood. <ref>B.

==Consequences==. 
===Climatic effects=== . 

A study presented at the annual meeting of the [[American Geophysical Union]] in December 2006 found that even a small-scale, regional nuclear war could disrupt the global climate for a decade or more. In a regional nuclear conflict scenario where two opposing nations in the [[subtropics]] would each use 50 [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]]-sized nuclear weapons (about 15 kiloton each) on major populated centers, the researchers estimated as much as five million tons of soot would be released, which would produce a cooling of several degrees over large areas of [[North America]] and [[Eurasia]], including most of the grain-growing regions. The cooling would last for years, and according to the research could be "catastrophic". <ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/12/061211090729.htm Regional Nuclear War Could Devastate Global Climate], Science Daily, December 11, 2006</ref><ref>[http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/nuclear/ The published papers that were first presented at the AGU Meeting.]</ref> . 

===Ozone depletion=== . 

A 2008 study published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Science]] found that a nuclear weapons exchange between Pakistan and India using their current arsenals could create a near- global ozone hole, triggering human health problems and wreaking environmental havoc for at least a decade. <ref>{{cite journal |title=Massive global ozone loss predicted following regional nuclear conflict |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |year=2008 |pmid=18391218 |pmc=2291128 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0710058105 |last1=Mills |first1=M. J. |last2=Toon |first2=O. B. |last3=Turco |first3=R. P. |last4=Kinnison |first4=D.

The soot would absorb enough solar radiation to heat surrounding gases, setting in motion a series of chemical reactions that would break down the stratospheric ozone layer protecting Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.  . 

==Recent modeling==. 
Based on new work published in 2007 and 2008 by some of the authors of the original studies, several new [[hypotheses]] have been put forth. <ref>[http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/nuclear/ Climatic Consequences of Nuclear Conflict] Department of Environmental Sciences, Rutgers University</ref> . 

A minor nuclear war with each country using 50 Hiroshima-sized atom bombs as airbursts on urban areas could produce climate change unprecedented in recorded human history. A nuclear war between the United States and Russia today could produce nuclear winter, with [[temperatures]] plunging below freezing in the summer in major [[agricultural]] regions, threatening the food supply for most of the planet. The climatic effects of the smoke from burning cities and industrial areas would last for several years, much longer than previously thought. New climate model simulations, which are said to have the capability of including the entire atmosphere and [[oceans]], show that the smoke would be lofted by solar heating to the upper stratosphere, where it would remain for years.  . 

Compared to climate change for the past millennium, even the smallest exchange modeled would plunge the planet into temperatures colder than the [[Little Ice Age]] (the period of history between approximately A.D. 1600 and A.D. 1850). This would take effect instantly, and agriculture would be severely threatened. Larger amounts of smoke would produce larger climate changes, and for the 150 [[Teragram|Tg]] case produce a true nuclear winter (1 Tg is 10^12 grams), making agriculture impossible for years. In both cases, new climate model simulations show that the effects would last for more than a decade.  . 

===2007 study on global nuclear war===. 
A study published in the ''[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]'' in July 2007,<ref name="2007abstract">[http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2007/2006JD008235.shtml Abstract on Journal of Geophysical Research website]</ref> ''Nuclear winter revisited with a modern climate model and current nuclear arsenals: Still catastrophic consequences'',<ref name="2007pdf">[http://www.envsci.rutgers.edu/%7Egera/nwinter/nw6accepted.pdf paper available online from Rutgers University website]</ref> used current climate models to look at the consequences of a global nuclear war involving most or all of the world's current nuclear arsenals (which the authors described as being only about a third the size of the world's arsenals twenty years earlier). The authors used a [[Global climate model|global circulation model]], ModelE from the [[NASA]] [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]], which they noted "has been tested extensively in global warming experiments and to examine the effects of volcanic eruptions on climate." The model was used to investigate the effects of a war involving the entire current global nuclear arsenal, projected to release about 150 Tg of smoke into the atmosphere, as well as a war involving about one third of the current nuclear arsenal, projected to release about 50 Tg of smoke. In the 150 Tg case they found that: . 

{{quote|A global average surface cooling of –7°C to –8°C persists for years, and after a decade the cooling is still –4°C (Fig. 2). Considering that the global average cooling at the depth of the last ice age 18,000 yr ago was about –5°C, this would be a climate change unprecedented in speed and amplitude in the history of the human race. The temperature changes are largest over land ... Cooling of more than –20°C occurs over large areas of North America and of more than –30°C over much of Eurasia, including all agricultural regions.}} . 

In addition, they found that this cooling caused a weakening of the global hydrological cycle, reducing global [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] by about 45%. As for the 50 Tg case involving one third of current nuclear arsenals, they said that the simulation "produced climate responses very similar to those for the 150 Tg case, but with about half the amplitude," but that "the time scale of response is about the same." They did not discuss the implications for agriculture in depth, but noted that a 1986 study which assumed no food production for a year projected that "most of the people on the planet would run out of food and starve to death by then" and commented that their own results show that "this period of no food production needs to be extended by many years, making the impacts of nuclear winter even worse than previously thought." . 

===Kuwait wells in the first Gulf War===. 
Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, [[Carl Sagan]] and other scientists predicted that burning oil wells could cause environmental damage comparable to nuclear winter. <ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6tEVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RBQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6851,2148654&dq=world-climate-conference+oil+fires&hl=en Wilmington morning Star] January 21’st, 1991</ref> Nearly 700 oil wells were set ablaze by the retreating Iraqi army and the fires were not fully extinguished until November 6, 1991, eight months after the end of the war. <ref>[http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/owf_ii/owf_ii_tabc.htm GulfLink Summary of Oil Well fires]</ref> The fires consumed an estimated six million barrels of oil daily.  . 

According to a 1992 study from [[Peter V. Hobbs|Peter Hobbs]] and Lawrence Radke, daily emissions of [[sulfur dioxide]] were 57% of that from electric utilities in the United States, emissions of [[carbon dioxide]] were 2% of global emissions and emissions of [[soot]] were 3,400 metric tons per day. <ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal |first1=Peter V. |last1=Hobbs |first2=Lawrence F. |last2=Radke |title=Airborne Studies of the Smoke from the Kuwait Oil Fires |journal=Science |date=May 15, 1992 |doi= 10.1126/science.256.5059.987 |volume=256 |issue=5059 |pages=987–91 |pmid=17795001 }}</ref> However, pre-war claims of wide scale, long-lasting, and significant global environmental impacts were not borne out and found to be significantly exaggerated by the media and speculators,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hosny Khordagu, Dhari Al-Ajmi |title=Environmental impact of the Gulf War: An integrated preliminary assessment |journal=Environmental Management |volume=17 |issue=4 |month=July |year=1993 }}</ref> with climate models at the time of the fires predicting only more localized effects such as a daytime temperature drop of ~10 °C within ~200&nbsp;km of the source. <ref>[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v351/n6325/abs/351363a0.html Environmental effects from burning oil wells in Kuwait] by K.

Turco|Turco]], Toon, Ackerman, Pollack, Sagan (TTAPS) study hypothesized in January 1991 that enough smoke from the fires "might get so high as to disrupt agriculture in much of South Asia...."

The 2007 study discussed above noted that modern computer models have been applied to the Kuwait oil fires, finding that individual smoke plumes are not able to loft smoke into the [[stratosphere]], but that smoke from fires covering a large area, like some forest fires<ref>[http://www.espo.nasa.gov/docs/crystalface/Jost2004.grl.pdf In-situ observations of mid-latitude forest fire plumes deep in the stratosphere]</ref><ref>[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=16641 EO Newsroom: New Images - Smoke Soars to Stratospheric Heights]</ref><ref>[http://www.cpi.com/remsensing/midatm/smoke.html Observations of Boreal Forest Fire Smoke in the Stratosphere]</ref><ref>Fromm et al., 2006, [http://www.agu.org/cgi-bin/SFgate/SFgate?&listenv=table&multiple=1&range=1&directget=1&application=fm06&database=%2Fdata%2Fepubs%2Fwais%2Findexes%2Ffm06%2Ffm06&maxhits=200&=%22U14A-04%22 Smoke in the Stratosphere: What Wildfires have Taught Us About Nuclear Winter], Eos Trans.

==History==. 
===Early work===. 
In June 1957, ''The Effects of Nuclear Weapons'' by [[Samuel Glasstone]] was published containing a section entitled "Nuclear Bombs and the Weather" (pages 69–71), which states: "The dust raised in severe [[volcanic eruptions]], such as that at [[Krakatoa]] in 1883, is known to cause a noticeable reduction in the sunlight reaching the earth ... The amount of debris remaining in the atmosphere after the explosion of even the largest nuclear weapons is probably not more than about 1 percent or so of that raised by the [[Krakatoa]] eruption. Further, solar radiation records reveal that none of the nuclear explosions to date has resulted in any detectable change in the direct sunlight recorded on the ground."<ref>[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?seq=9&view=image&size=100&id=mdp.39015010999814&u=1&num=69 Samuel Glasstone, ''The Effects of Nuclear Weapons'', Washington DC, Government Printing Office, 1956, p.69]</ref> In 1974, John Hampson suggested that a full-scale nuclear exchange could result in depletion of the ozone shield, possibly subjecting the earth to ultraviolet radiation for a year or more. <ref name=effects>[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=540 Committee on the Atmospheric Effects of Nuclear Explosions, ''The Effects on the Atmosphere of a Major Nuclear Exchange'', Washington D.C., National Academy Press, 1985]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hampson J. |title=Photochemical war on the atmosphere |journal=Nature |volume=250 |issue=5463 |pages=189–91 |year=1974 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v250/n5463/pdf/250189a0.pdf |doi=10.1038/250189a0}}</ref> In 1975, the [[United States National Research Council]] (NRC) reported on ozone depletion following nuclear war, judging that the effect of dust would probably be slight climatic cooling. <ref name=effects/><ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JVArAAAAYAAJ&dq=%22Long-term%20worldwide%20effects%20of%20multiple%20nuclear%20weapons%20detonations%22&pg=PA25#v=onepage&q=&f=false National Research Council, ''Long-term worldwide effects of multiple nuclear weapons detonations'', Washington DC, National Academy of Sciences, 1975, p.38]</ref> . 

===1982===. 
In 1981, William J. Moran began discussions and research in the NRC on the dust effects of a large exchange of nuclear warheads. An NRC study panel on the topic met in December 1981 and April 1982. <ref name=effects/> . 

As part of a study launched in 1980 by ''Ambio'', a journal of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]], [[Paul Crutzen]] and John Birks circulated a draft paper in early 1982 with the first quantitative evidence of alterations in short-term climate after a nuclear war. <ref name=effects/> In 1982, a special issue of ''[[Ambio]]'' devoted to the possible environmental consequences of nuclear war included a paper by Crutzen and Birks anticipating the nuclear winter scenario. <ref name=crutzen>{{cite journal |author=Crutzen P., Birks J. |title=The atmosphere after a nuclear war: Twilight at noon |journal=Ambio |volume=11 |pages=114–25 |year=1982 |jstor=4312777 |issue=2}}</ref> The paper discussed particulates from large fires, nitrogen oxide, ozone depletion and the effect of nuclear twilight on agriculture. Crutzen and Birks showed that smoke injected into the atmosphere by fires in cities, forests and petroleum reserves could prevent up to 99% of sunlight from reaching the Earth's surface, with major climatic consequences: "The normal dynamic and temperature structure of the atmosphere would therefore change considerably over a large fraction of the Northern Hemisphere, which will probably lead to important changes in land surface temperatures and wind systems."<ref name=crutzen/> An important implication of their work was that a "first strike" nuclear attack would have severe consequences for the perpetrator.  . 

===1983===. 
In 1982, the so-called TTAPS team ([[Richard P. Turco]], [[Owen Toon]], Thomas P. Ackerman, [[James B. Pollack]] and [[Carl Sagan]]) undertook a computational modeling study of the atmospheric consequences of [[nuclear war]], publishing their results in ''[[Science magazine|Science]]'' in December 1983. <ref>{{cite journal |author=R. P. Turco, O. B. Toon, T. P. Ackerman, J. B. Pollack, and Carl Sagan |title=Nuclear Winter: Global Consequences of Multiple Nuclear Explosions |journal=Science |volume=222 |issue=4630 |pages=1283–92 |date=23 December 1983 |pmid=17773320 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/222/4630/1283 |doi=10.1126/science.222.4630.1283}}</ref> The phrase "nuclear winter" was coined by Turco just prior to publication. <ref>[http://google.com/search?q=cache:HPi24DhYQb8J:www.answers.com/topic/nuclear-winter+turco+nuclear+winter&cd=10&hl=en&ct=clnk US Military History Companion]</ref> In this early work, TTAPS carried out the first estimates of the total smoke and dust emissions that would result from a major nuclear exchange, and determined quantitatively the subsequent effects on the atmospheric radiation balance and temperature structure. To compute dust and smoke impacts, they employed a one-dimensional microphysics/radiative-transfer model of the Earth's lower atmosphere (to the mesopause), which defined only the vertical characteristics of the global climate perturbation.  . 

Around this time, interest in nuclear war environmental effects also arose in the USSR. After becoming aware of the work of the Swedish Academy and, in particular, papers by N.P.Bochkov and [[Yevgeniy Chazov|E.I.Chazov]],<ref>{{cite book |author=Chazov, E.I., Vartanian, M.E. |chapter=Effects on human behaviour |editor=Peterson, Jeannie |title=The Aftermath: the human and ecological consequences of nuclear war |publisher=Pantheon Books |location=New York |year=1983 |pages=155–63 |isbn=0-394-72042-3 }}</ref> Russian atmospheric scientist [[Georgy Golitsyn]] applied his research on dust-storms to the situation following a nuclear catastrophe. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Vladimir Gubarev |title=Tea Drinking in The Academy.

I. Stenchikov soon published a report on the climatic consequences of nuclear war based on simulations with a two-level global circulation model, which produced results consistent with the TTAPS findings. <ref>Alexandrov, V. V. and G. I. Stenchikov (1983): "On the modeling of the climatic consequences of the nuclear war" The Proceeding of Appl. Mathematics, 21 p., The Computing Center of the AS USSR, Moscow. </ref> . 

===1986===. 
In 1984 the [[World Meteorological Organization|WMO]] commissioned Georgy Golitsyn and N. A. Phillips to review the state of the science. They found that studies generally assumed a scenario that half of the world's nuclear weapons would be used, ~5000 [[TNT equivalent|Mt]], destroying approximately 1,000 cities, and creating large quantities of carbonaceous smoke - 1–2&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;grams being mostly likely, with a range of 0.2&nbsp;–&nbsp;6.4&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>14</sup> grams (NAS; TTAPS assumed 2.25&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>14</sup>). The smoke resulting would be largely opaque to solar radiation but transparent to infra-red, thus cooling by blocking sunlight but not causing warming from enhancing the [[greenhouse effect]]. The [[optical depth]] of the smoke can be much greater than unity. Forest fires resulting from non-urban targets could increase aerosol production further. Dust from near-surface explosions against hardened targets also contributes; each Mt-equivalent of explosion could release up to 5 million [[ton]]s of dust, but most would quickly fall out; high altitude dust is estimated at 0.1-1 million tons per Mt-equivalent of explosion. Burning of crude oil could also contribute substantially.  . 

The 1-D radiative-convective models used in these studies produced a range of results, with coolings up to 15-42 °C between 14 and 35 days after the war, with a "baseline" of about 20 °C. Somewhat more sophisticated calculations using 3-D [[Global climate model|GCM]]s (Alexandrov and Stenchikov (1983); Covey, Schneider and Thompson (1984); produced similar results: temperature drops of between 20 and 40 °C, though with regional variations.  . 

All calculations show large heating (up to 80 °C) at the top of the smoke layer at about 10&nbsp;km; this implies a substantial modification of the circulation there and the possibility of advection of the cloud into low latitudes and the southern hemisphere.  . 

The report made no attempt to compare the likely human impacts of the post-war cooling to the direct deaths from explosions.  . 

===1990===. 
In 1990, in a paper entitled "Climate and Smoke: An Appraisal of Nuclear Winter," TTAPS give a more detailed description of the short- and long-term atmospheric effects of a nuclear war using a three-dimensional model<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/23/science/nuclear-winter-theorists-pull-back.html?pagewanted=all "Nuclear Winter Theorists Pull Back" The New York Times, January 23, 1990]</ref>: .

*10 to 25% of soot injected is immediately removed by precipitation, while the rest is transported over the globe in 1 to 2 weeks . 

*SCOPE figures for July smoke injection:
**22 °C drop in mid-latitudes

*Ozone depletion of 50% leading to 200% increase in UV radiation incident on surface.  . 

==Criticism and debate==. 
The TTAPS study was widely reported and criticized in the media. Later model runs in some cases predicted less severe effects, but continued to support the overall conclusion of significant global cooling. <ref name="Martin">[http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/88spp.html Nuclear winter: science and politics]</ref><ref>[http://www.sgr.org.uk/climate/NuclearWinter_NL27.htm Does Anybody Remember The Nuclear Winter?]</ref> Recent studies (2006) substantiate that smoke from urban firestorms in a regional war would lead to long lasting global cooling but in a less dramatic manner than the nuclear winter scenario,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.5194/acpd-6-11745-2006 |author=Toon, O.

The original work by Sagan and others was criticized as a "myth" and "discredited theory" in the 1987 book [[Nuclear War Survival Skills]], a [[civil defense]] manual by [[Cresson Kearny]] for the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]. <ref name="ORNL">{{cite book | last=Kearny | first=Cresson | title=Nuclear War Survival Skills | year=1987 | pages=17–19 | url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/ | isbn=0-942487-01-X | publisher=Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine | location=Cave Junction, OR | authorlink=Cresson Kearny}}</ref> Kearny said the maximum estimated temperature drop would be only about by 20 degrees Fahrenheit (11 degrees Celsius), and that this amount of cooling would last only a few days. He also suggested that a global nuclear war would indeed result in millions of deaths from hunger, but primarily due to cessation of international food supplies, rather than due to climate changes. <ref name="ORNL"/> . 

Kearny, who was not a climate scientist himself, based his conclusions almost entirely on the 1986 paper "Nuclear Winter Reappraised"<ref>Thompson, Starley L & Schneider, Stephen H [http://www.jstor.org/pss/20042777 Nuclear Winter Reappraised] in Foreign Affairs, Vol. 64, No. 5 (Summer, 1986), pp. 981-1005</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last=Thompson | first=Starley L. | coauthors=Stephen H. Schneider | title=Nuclear Winter Reappraised | journal=Foreign Affairs | volume=62 | issue=Summer 1986 | pages=981–1005| url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19860601faessay7798/starley-l-thompson-stephen-h-schneider/nuclear-winter-reappraised.html}}</ref> by Starley Thompson and Stephen Schneider. However, a 1988 article by Brian Martin in ''Science and Public Policy''<ref name="Martin"/> states that although their paper concluded the effects would be less severe than originally thought, with the authors describing these effects as a "nuclear autumn", other statements by Thompson and Schneider<ref>Stephen H. Schneider, letter, ''Wall Street Journal'', 25 November 1986. </ref><ref>'Severe global-scale nuclear war effects reaffirmed', statement resulting from SCOPE-ENUWAR workshop in Bangkok, 9–12 February 1987. </ref> show that they "resisted the interpretation that this means a rejection of the basic points made about nuclear winter". In addition, the authors of the [[Nuclear winter#2007 study on global nuclear war|2007 study above]] state that "because of the use of the term 'nuclear autumn' by Thompson and Schneider [1986], even though the authors made clear that the climatic consequences would be large, in policy circles the theory of nuclear winter is considered by some to have been exaggerated and disproved [e.g., Martin, 1988]."<ref name="2007abstract"/><ref name="2007pdf"/> And in 2007 Schneider emphasized the danger of serious climate changes from a limited nuclear war of the kind analyzed in the [[Nuclear winter#Climatic effects|2006 study above]], saying "The sun is much stronger in the tropics than it is in mid-latitudes. Therefore, a much more limited war [there] could have a much larger effect, because you are putting the smoke in the worst possible place."<ref>[http://cesp.stanford.edu/news/climate_scientist_stephen_schneider_describes_chilling_consequences_of_a_nuclear_war_20070111/index.html Climate scientist Stephen Schneider describes chilling consequences of a nuclear war]</ref> . 

===Firestorm formation===. 
{{Synthesis|section|date=April 2011}}
All the papers begin with the common premise: a large quantity of carbon aerosol has found its way into the [[stratosphere]]. As [[firestorm]] formation is clearly a necessity to generate the form of smoke discussed in the [[climatology]] models, this is the bedrock to all nuclear winter predictions. The 150 Tg [[carbon]] soot aerosol injection into the stratosphere, which the TTAPS paper required to cause nuclear winter, has been criticised on the basis of World War II [[firestorm]] ignition evidence from Japanese and medieval European wooden cities,<ref name="na.gov.uk">[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATLN=6&CATID=3055077&FullDetails=True&j=1&Gsm=2008-08-08 Effects of atomic bomb on Hiroshima.Vol. 1] The National Archives</ref> since unbiased factual evidence exists in survivor testimony from Hiroshima that soot was actually precipitated as rainout during the firestorm-the infamous ''black rain'' a natural phenomenon produced by [[Pyrocumulus cloud]]s. At Hiroshima, the infamous ''black rain'' formed soon after the bombing, washing large amounts of carbon out of the atmosphere. <ref name="na.gov.uk"/> . 

Unlike the Japanese wooden cities of 1945 and medieval wooden housing areas of Germany where firestorms occurred,<ref name="na.gov.uk"/> modern cities are not built out of predominantly [[flammable|flammable materials]] like wood, but built of mostly [[concrete]] and [[brick|masonry brick]]. <ref name="na.gov.uk"/> . 

[[Image:Nuclear winter in Hiroshima.JPG|thumb|400px|Sunshine record in Hiroshima, a wooden city nuclear explosion firestorm event on 6 August 1945. Sunshine was interrupted for just 25 minutes when the soot from the firestorm was washed out of the atmosphere by the hydroscopic (water absorbing) soot before it could be heated to reach the stratosphere. <ref name="osti.gov">Oughterson, et al. [http://www.osti.gov/bridge/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=4421057 Medical effects of atomic bombs the report of the joint commission for the investigation of the effects of the atomic bomb in Japan volume 1.] Army Inst. of Pathology, April 19, 1951 [http://dx.doi.org/10.2172/4421057 doi:10.2172/4421057]</ref> The critic J. B. Knox of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in report UCRL-89907 claimed that this black rain effect from the nuclear firestorm data casts a doubt on nuclear winter.]] . 

The nuclear winter effect from the firestorm in Hiroshima blocked out the sun for 25 minutes (from burst time at 8:15 am until 8:40 am) as shown by the meteorological sunshine records printed in Figure 6 (3H) of the Report of the Joint Commission for the Investigation of the Effects of the Atomic Bomb in Japan, Volume 1, Office of the Air Surgeon, report NP-3036, April 19, 1951, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. <ref name="osti.gov"/> The Hiroshima firestorm soot was hydroscopic, absorbing water and falling out in black rain, which limited the climatic effect. The fact that soot was rapidly precipitated in a self-induced rainout in Hiroshima was in 1983 used as a nuclear winter criticism by J. B. Knox of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in report UCRL-89907. No other nuclear explosion ever created a firestorm, including detonations of up to [[Castle Bravo|15 megatons]] beside naturally forested islands-[[Bikini Atoll|Bikini]] and [[Eniwetok Atoll]], which failed to ignite the trees due to the high (80%) air humidity and its effects both on ignition and thermal pulse transmission. <ref>[http://www.hss.energy.gov/HealthSafety/IHS/marshall/collection/data/ihp1d/49309z.pdf Operation Castle, Project 3.3, Blast effects on tree stand (report to the test director)] W.L Fons & Theodore G. Storey, U.S. Department of Agriculture, March 1955</ref> Targeting oil wells instead of cities, as was done in the final TTAPS paper to compensate for reduced estimates of city firestorm soot emission, reduces the moisture effect, but the soot doesn't rise high enough from burning oil wells for widespread climatic effects, as proved in 1991 when [[Iraq]] set fire to all of Kuwait’s oil fields.  . 

Lastly, there is the question of whether the thermal pulse of a modern [[nuclear bomb|nuclear weapon]] is sufficient to ignite an entire modern city, or simply level most of it to the ground. The generating mechanism for the [[firestorm]] that engulfed [[Atomic bombing of Hiroshima|Hiroshima]] was not(as some contend<ref>Eden, Lynn [http://books.google.com/books?id=qzfLEpFSMMQC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&q=10%20cal&f=false Whole World on Fire: Organizations, Knowledge, And Nuclear Weapons Devastation] Cornell University Press, 2004, ISBN 9780801435782</ref>) directly linked to the [[thermal pulse]] from the [[Little boy|atomic bomb]], but in reality the major causative agent of the firestorm was the timing of the bombing, and to a lesser degree the exceptionally dry weather conditions preceding the bomb run. The fact that the bombing occurred at 08:15 local time meant the bombing occurred right around breakfast time,<ref name="na.gov.uk"/><ref>Toshi Maruki [http://www.arvindguptatoys.com/arvindgupta/tfoh.pdf The Fire of Hiroshima]</ref> which importantly implies that the fires were secondary in nature, started from overturned cooking devices when the [[blast wave]] arrived, This is in direct contrast to the [[atomic bombing of Nagasaki]], where no true [[firestorm]] formed. <ref>[http://amstd.spb.ru/worldw2/Hirosima.htm Hiroshima and Nagasaki: The Devastation of atomic bombs, 1945]</ref><ref>[http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA087568 The Effects of Nuclear Weapons] Glasstone, Samuel ; Dolan, Philip J. Department of Defense, 1977</ref> . 

The originally secret 6 volume U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey reports on Hiroshima and Nagasaki disclose that there had been no significant rain for 3 weeks prior to the Hiroshima bombing, and for 10 days prior to the Nagasaki bombing, except for one light shower on August 5. <ref>[http://www.rerf.or.jp/shared/ds02/pdf/chapter03/cha03-p139-155.pdf Radiation transport calculations for Hiroshima and Nagasaki]</ref> The May 1947 U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey report on Hiroshima lists all the factors that contributed to the firestorm on pages 4–6: "Six persons who had been in reinforced-concrete buildings within 3,200 feet of air zero stated that black cotton black-out curtains were ignited by flash heat... A large proportion of over 1,000 persons questioned was, however, in agreement that a great majority of the original fires were started by debris falling on kitchen charcoal fires ... There had been practically no rain in the city for about 3 weeks. The velocity of the wind ... was not more than 5 miles per hour.... Hundreds of fires were reported to have started in the centre of the city within 10 minutes after the explosion... almost no effort was made to fight this conflagration ... There were no automatic sprinkler systems in buildings...". <ref name="na.gov.uk"/><ref name="osti.gov">Oughterson, et al, See page 63 or internally page 73 as it states the Hiroshima fires were secondary in nature. [http://www.osti.gov/bridge/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=4421057 Medical effects of atomic bombs the report of the joint commission for the investigation of the effects of the atomic bomb in Japan volume 1. This document also states that the fires were secondary in nature, see page 63 or internally number page 73]</ref> . 

==Policy implications==. 
In an interview in 2000, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], in response to the comment "In the 1980s, you warned about the unprecedented dangers of nuclear weapons and took very daring steps to reverse the arms race," said "Models made by Russian and American scientists showed that a nuclear war would result in a nuclear winter that would be extremely destructive to all life on Earth; the knowledge of that was a great stimulus to us, to people of honor and morality, to act in that situation."<ref>[http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2000/09/07/gorbachev/ Mikhail Gorbachev explains what's rotten in Russia]</ref> .
