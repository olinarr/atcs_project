==Pre-strike activity==. 
In 2001, the [[Mossad]], Israel's external intelligence service, was profiling newly-inducted Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]]. Visits by [[North Korea]]n dignitaries, which focused on advanced arms deliveries, were noticed. [[Military Intelligence Directorate (Israel)|Aman]], Israel's [[military intelligence]] department, suggested nuclear arms were being discussed, but the Mossad dismissed this theory. In spring 2004, U.S. intelligence reported multiple communications between Syria and North Korea, and traced the calls to a desert location called al-Kibar. [[Unit 8200]], Israel's [[signals intelligence]] and codebreaking unit, added the location to its watch list. <ref name="strike in the desert"/> . 

On April 22, 2004, [[Ryongchon disaster|a massive explosion]] occurred on a North Korean freight train heading for the port of [[Namp'o]]. According to British intelligence writer [[Gordon Thomas]], the Mossad had learned that dozens of Syrian nuclear technicians were in a compartment adjoining a sealed wagon. According to Thomas, the Syrians had arrived in North Korea to collect the fissionable material stored in the wagon. All of the technicians were killed in the train explosion. Their bodies were flown to Syria in lead-encased coffins aboard a Syrian military plane. A wide area around the explosion site was cordoned off for days as North Korean soldiers in anti-contamination suits collected wreckage and sprayed the area. Mossad analysts suspected they were trying to recover weapons-grade plutonium. Since the explosion, the Mossad tracked about a dozen trips by Syrian military officers and scientists to [[Pyongyang]], where they met with high-ranking North Korean officials. <ref name="thomas"/> . 

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', citing anonymous sources, reported that in December 2006, a top Syrian official arrived in [[London]] under a false name. The Mossad had detected a booking for the official in a London hotel, and dispatched at least ten undercover agents to London. The agents were split into three teams. One group was sent to [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]] to identify the official as he arrived, a second to book into his hotel, and a third to monitor his movements and visitors. Some of the operatives were from the Kidon Division, which specializes in assassinations, and the Negev Division, which specializes in breaking into homes, embassies, and hotel rooms to install bugging devices. On the first day of his visit, he visited the Syrian embassy and then went shopping. Kidon operatives closely followed him, while Negev operatives broke into his hotel room and found his laptop. A computer expert then installed software that allowed the Mossad to monitor his activities on the computer. When the computer material was examined at Mossad headquarters, officials found blueprints and hundreds of pictures of the Kibar facility in various stages of construction, and correspondence. One photograph showed North Korean nuclear official [[Chon Chibu]] meeting with Ibrahim Othman, Syria's atomic energy agency director. Though the Mossad had originally planned to kill the official in London, it was decided to spare his life following the discovery. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/8514919/Mossad-carries-out-daring-London-raid-on-Syrian-official.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Duncan | last=Gardham | title=Mossad carries out daring London raid on Syrian official | date=2011-05-15}}</ref> Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] was notified. The following month, Olmert formed a three-member panel to report on Syria's nuclear program. Six months later, Brigadier-General Ya'akov Amidror, one of the panel's members, informed Olmert that Syria was working with North Korea and [[Iran]] on a nuclear facility. Iran had funneled $1 billion to the project, and planned on using the Kibar facility to replace Iranian facilities if Iran was unable to complete its uranium enrichment program. <ref name="strike in the desert"/> . 

In July 2007, an [[July 2007 Syrian arms depot explosion|explosion occurred]] in [[Musalmiya]], northern Syria. The official Sana news agency said 15 Syrian military personnel were killed and 50 people were injured. The agency reported only that "very explosive products" blew up after a fire broke out at the facility. The September 26 edition of ''[[Jane's Defence Weekly]]'' claimed that the explosion happened during tests to weaponise a [[Scud#Scud-C|Scud-C]] missile with [[mustard gas]]. <ref>"[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iJugIQvDKwkxupz9eULk1ml6OZ4Q Syria blast 'linked to chemical weapons': report]", [[Agence France-Presse]] (AFP), 2007-09-19. Retrieved 2008-04-26</ref> . 

A senior U.S. official told ''[[ABC News]]'' that, in early summer 2007, Israel had discovered a suspected Syrian nuclear facility, and that the [[Mossad]] then "managed to either co-opt one of the facility's workers or to insert a spy posing as an employee" at the suspected Syrian nuclear site, and through this was able to get pictures of the target from on the ground."<ref>Raddatz, Martha.

Retrieved on 2007-10-26. </ref> Two months before the strike, Israel launched the [[Ofek-7]] spy satellite into space. The satellite was geo-positioned to watch activity at the complex. <ref name="thomas"/> . 

In August 2007, Israeli commandos from the [[Sayeret Matkal]] reconnaisance unit covertly raided the suspected Syrian nuclear facility and brought nuclear material back to Israel. Two helicopters ferried twelve commandos to the site in order to get photographic evidence and soil samples. The commandos were probably dressed in Syrian uniforms. Although the mission was successful, it had to be aborted earlier than planned after the Israelis were spotted by Syrian soldiers. Soil analysis revealed traces of nuclear activity. <ref>''Snatched: Israeli commandos 'nuclear' find'' Times Online, 23 September 2007</ref><ref name="strike in the desert">{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3799227,00.html |title=A strike in the desert - Israel News, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=2012-01-29}}</ref><ref name=defector/> Anonymous sources reported that once material was tested and confirmed to have come from [[North Korea]], the [[United States]] approved an Israeli attack on the site. <ref name="Sunday Times Sep-23" /> Senior U.S. officials later claimed that they were not involved in or approved the attack, but were informed in advance. <ref>Hess, Pamela.

The [[Israeli Air Force]] pilots who took part in the operation were personally handpicked by General [[Eliezer Shkedy]], commander of the Israeli Air Force. Shkedy chose pilots whose flying skills matched his own. The pilots began training weeks before the raid. The pilots trained to hit a small target at an angled dive of thirty degrees. During the practice missions, the pilots used dummy bombs which exploded [[white phosphorus]] smoke on the target to determine the accuracy of the drops. The drills were carried out over the [[Negev]] at night. The pilots were not told of their target until they were briefed by General Shkedy shortly before the operation began. During the briefing, Shkedy assured the pilots that Syrian air defenses would be jammed, and warned them that no bombs were to fall on civilians. <ref name="thomas"/> . 

On September 4, key players in the operation met in General Shkedy's headquarters. The photographs taken by a Mossad agent as the ship was being unloaded, as well as the agent's report, were the focus of the meeting. <ref name="thomas"/> .

On April 27, 2008 Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]], making his first public comments about the raid, dismissed the allegations that it was a nuclear site which was attacked as false: "Is it logical? A nuclear site did not have protection with surface to air defenses? A nuclear site within the footprint of satellites in the middle of Syria in an open area in the desert?"  Independent experts, however,  suggested that Syria did not fortify its suspected reactor in order to avoid drawing attention and because the building was not yet operational. Besides a nuclear program, Syria is believed to have extensive arsenals, as well as biological and chemical warheads for its long-range missiles. <ref>[http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/108275.html Breaking News - JTA, Jewish & Israel News]</ref><ref>"[http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL27399094 Assad says facility Israel bombed not nuclear-paper]."

==International reactions==. 
No Arab government besides Syria has formally commented on the September 6 incident. The Egyptian weekly ''[[Al-Ahram]]'' commented on the "synchronized silence of the Arab world." Neither the Israeli nor Syrian government has offered a detailed description of what occurred. Outside experts and media commentators have filled the data vacuum by offering their own diverse interpretations about what precisely happened that night. Western commentators took the position that the lack of official non-Syrian Arab condemnations of Israel's action, threats of retaliation against Israel, or even professions of support for the Syrian government or people must imply that their governments tacitly supported the Israeli action. Even Iranian officials have not formally commented on the Israeli attack or Syria's reactions. <ref>Weitz, Richard.

On October 17, in reaction to the UN press office's release of a [[General Assembly First Committee|First Committee, Disarmament and International Security]] meeting's minutes that paraphrased an unnamed Syrian representative as saying that a nuclear facility was hit by the raid, Syria denied the statement, adding that "such facilities do not exist in Syria."

''The New York Times'' on October 26 published satellite photographs showing that the Syrians had almost entirely removed all remains of the facility.

On April 28, 2008, CIA Director Michael Hayden said that a suspected Syrian reactor bombed by Israel had the capacity to produce enough nuclear material to fuel one to two weapons a year, and that it was of a "similar size and technology" to [[North Korea]]'s [[Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center]]. <ref>[http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKN2820597020080429 UPDATE 2-Syrian reactor capacity was 1-2 weapons/year -CIA | Markets | Reuters]</ref> . 

In his memoir ''[[Decision Points]]'', President [[George W. Bush]] claimed that the strike confirmed that Syria had been pursuing a nuclear-weapons program and that "intelligence is not an exact science", relating that while he had been told that U.S. analysts only had low confidence that the facility was part of a nuclear-weapons program, surveillance after the airstrike showed parts of the destroyed facility being covered up. Bush wrote that "if the facility was really just an innocent research lab, Syrian President Assad would have been screaming at the Israelis on the floor of the United Nations". He also wrote that in a telephone conversation with Olmert, he suggested that the operation be kept secret for a while and then made public to isolate the Syrian government, but Olmert asked for total secrecy, wanting to avoid anything that might force Syrian retaliation. <ref name="bush"/> . 

==Release of intelligence== . 

On October 10, 2007 ''The New York Times'' reported that the Israelis had shared the Syrian strike dossier with Turkey. In turn the Turks traveled to Damascus and confronted the Syrians with the dossier alleging a nuclear program. Syria denied this with vigor saying that the target was a storage depot for strategic missiles. <ref>"[[Mark Mazzetti]]; Helene Cooper, [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/washington/10diplo.html An Israeli Strike on Syria Kindles Debate in the U.S.]", ''The New York Times'', 2007-10-10. </ref> On October 25, 2007 ''The New York Times'' reported that two commercial satellite photos taken before and after the raid showed that a square building no longer exists at the suspected site. <ref>Broad, William.

A statement from the [[White House Press Secretary]] on April 24, 2008 followed the briefing given to some Congressional committees that week.

Syrian officials, however, denied any North Korean involvement in their country. According to the BBC, Syria's ambassador to the UK, Sami Khiyami, dismissed the allegations as ridiculous. "We are used to such allegations now, since the day the United States has invaded Iraq - you remember all the theatrical presentations concerning the WMDs [[weapons of mass destruction]] in Iraq."

== Initial skepticism about the US and Israeli claims == . 

Despite the release of intelligence information from the American and Israeli sources, the attack on the Syrian site was initially controversial. Some commentators have argued that at the time of the attack the site had no obvious barbed wire or air defenses that would normally ring a sensitive military facility. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/12/world/middleeast/12syria.html?_r=1&oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | title=Syria Rebuilds on Site Destroyed by Israeli Bombs | first=William J. | last=Broad | date=2008-01-12 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}</ref> [[Mohammed ElBaradei]] had previously stated that Syria's ability to construct and run a complex nuclear process was doubtful - speaking ahead of the IAEA inspection of the alleged Syrian nuclear site, which has been demolished, he said: "It is doubtful we will find anything there now, assuming there was anything in the first place."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7463044.stm | work=BBC News | title=Will Syrian site mystery be solved? | date=2008-06-23 | accessdate=2010-05-20 | first=Paul | last=Reynolds}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that after the publishing of US intelligence data on April 24, "two senior intelligence officials acknowledged that the evidence had left them with no more than “low confidence” that Syria was preparing to build a nuclear weapon.

The report said the findings gleaned from inspectors' visit to the site in June were not enough to conclude a reactor was once there. It said further investigation and greater Syrian transparency were needed. The confidential nuclear safeguards report said Syria would be asked to show to inspectors debris and equipment whisked away from the site after the September 2007 Israeli air raid. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE4AI4WB20081119|title=Syria site hit by Israel resembled atom plant: IAEA|publisher=Reuters|date=19 November 2008|accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref> . 

On February 19, 2009, the IAEA reported that samples taken from the site revealed new traces of processed uranium. A senior UN official said additional analysis of the June find had found 40 more uranium particles, for a total of 80 particles, and described it as significant. He added that experts were analyzing minute traces of graphite and stainless steel found at and near the site, but said that it was too early to relate them to nuclear activity. The report noted Syria's refusal to allow agency inspectors to make follow-up visits to sites suspected of harboring a secret nuclear program despite repeated requests from top agency officials. <ref name=february19>{{Cite news
