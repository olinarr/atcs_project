The '''Hague Conventions''' were two international [[treaty|treaties]] negotiated at international [[peace]] conferences at [[The Hague]] in the  [[Netherlands]]: The '''First Hague Conference''' in 1899 and the '''Second Hague Conference''' in 1907. Along with the [[Geneva Conventions]], the Hague Conventions were among the first formal statements of the [[laws of war]] and [[war crime]]s in the nascent body of secular [[international law]]. A third conference was planned for 1914 and later rescheduled for 1915, but never took place due to the start of [[World War I]]. The German international law scholar and [[Neo-Kantianism|neo-Kantian]] [[pacifism|pacifist]] [[Walther Schücking]] called the assemblies the "international union of Hague conferences". <ref>Walther Schücking, ''The international union of the Hague conferences'', Clarendon Press, 1918. </ref> and saw them as a nucleus of an international federation that was to meet at regular intervals to administer justice and develop international law procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes, asserting "that a definite political union of the states of the world has been created with the First and Second Conferences." The various agencies created by the Conferences, like the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]], "are agents or organs of the union."<ref>''The International Union of the Hague Conferences'', page vi. </ref> . 

A major effort in both the conferences was to create a binding international court for compulsory arbitration to settle international disputes, which was considered necessary to replace the institution of [[war]]. This effort, however, failed to realize success either in 1899 or in 1907. The First Conference was generally a success and was focused on [[disarmament]] efforts. The Second Conference failed to create a binding international court for compulsory arbitration but did enlarge the machinery for voluntary arbitration, and established conventions regulating the collection of debts, rules of war, and the rights and obligations of neutrals. Along with disarmament and obligatory arbitration, both conferences included negotiations concerning the [[laws of war]] and [[war crime]]s. Many of the rules laid down at the Hague Conventions were violated in the First World War.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} . 

Most of the [[great power]]s, including the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], [[Russian history, 1892–1917|Russia]], [[France]], [[Qing dynasty|China]], and [[Persia]], favored a binding international arbitration, but the condition was that the vote should be unanimous, and a few countries, led by [[German Empire|Germany]], vetoed the idea.  . 

==Hague Convention of 1899==. 
The peace conference was proposed on August 29, 1898 by [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II]]. <ref>''The Proud Tower'', page 229</ref> Nicholas and Count [[Mikhail Nikolayevich Muravyov]], his [[foreign minister]], were instrumental in initiating the conference. It was held from May 18, 1899 and signed on July 29 of that year, and [[entered into force]] on September 4, 1900. The Hague Convention of 1899 consisted of four main sections and three additional declarations (the final main section is for some reason identical to the first additional declaration):
*[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/hague01.asp I]: Pacific Settlement of International Disputes
*[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/hague02.asp II]: Laws and Customs of War on Land
*[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/hague993.asp III]: Adaptation to Maritime Warfare of Principles of Geneva Convention of 1864
*[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/hague994.asp IV]: Prohibiting Launching of Projectiles and Explosives from Balloons
*[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/dec99-01.asp Declaration I]: On the Launching of Projectiles and Explosives from Balloons
*[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/dec99-02.asp Declaration II]: On the Use of Projectiles the Object of Which is the Diffusion of Asphyxiating or Deleterious Gases
*[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/dec99-03.asp Declaration III]: On the Use of Bullets Which Expand or Flatten Easily in the Human Body . 

The main effect of the Convention was to ban the use of certain types of modern technology in war: bombing from the air, [[chemical warfare]], and [[hollow point bullet]]s. The Convention also set up the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]].  . 

==Hague Convention of 1907==<!-- This section is linked from [[Nuremberg Trials]]. This section heading is used as part of the redirect for [[Hague Peace Conference (1907)]] and [[Hague Conventions (1907)]]--> . 

The second conference, in 1907, was generally a failure, with few major decisions. However, the meeting of major powers did prefigure later 20th-century attempts at international cooperation.  . 

The second conference was called at the suggestion of President Theodore Roosevelt in 1904, but postponed because of the war between Russia and Japan. The Second Peace  Conference was held from June 15 to October 18, 1907, to expand upon the original Hague Convention, modifying some parts and adding others, with an increased focus on naval warfare.   The British tried to secure limitation of armaments, but were defeated by the other powers, led by Germany, which feared a British attempt to stop the growth of the German fleet. Germany also rejected proposals for compulsory arbitration. However, the conference did enlarge the machinery for voluntary arbitration, and established conventions regulating the collection of debts, rules of war, and the rights and obligations of neutrals.  . 

The Final Agreement was signed on October 18, 1907, and entered into force on January 26, 1910.  It consisted of thirteen sections, of which twelve were ratified and entered into force:
* [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/pacific.asp I]: The Pacific Settlement of International Disputes
* [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hague072.asp II]: The Limitation of Employment of Force for Recovery of Contract Debts

* [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hague13.asp XIII]: The Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War . 

Two declarations were signed as well:
* Declaration I: extending Declaration II from the 1899 Conference to other types of aircraft<ref>However this extension was signed, among the great Powers, only by United Kingdom, United States of America and Austria-Hungary. Also Austria-Hungary never ratified it, so this extension remained, practically, only a purpose. Only the Article 25, ''The attack or bombardment, by whatever means, of towns, villages, dwellings, or buildings which are undefended is prohibited.'', with the words "whatever means" was a limitation to aerial bombing. {{cite web|url= http://www.icrc.org/IHL.NSF/INTRO/245?OpenDocument|title= Declaration (XIV) Prohibiting the Discharge of Projectiles and Explosives from Balloons. The Hague, 18 October 1907.|accessdate=23 August 2009}}</ref>
* Declaration II: on the obligatory arbitration . 

The Brazilian delegation was led by the statesman [[Ruy Barbosa]], whose contribution was essential for the defense of the principle of legal equality of nations. <ref>Klein, Robert A. (1974), Sovereign Equality Among States: The History of an Idea, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p. 61</ref> The British delegation included the [[Donald Mackay, 11th Lord Reay|11th Lord Reay (Donald James Mackay)]], Sir [[Ernest Satow]] and [[Eyre Crowe]]. The Russian delegation was led by [[Fyodor Martens]].The Uruguayan delegation was led by [[José Batlle y Ordóñez]], great defender of the compulsory arbitration by creating the idea of an International Court of Arbitration, and an alliance of nations to force the arbitration.  . 

==Geneva Protocol to Hague Convention==. 
Though not negotiated in The Hague, the [[Geneva Protocol]] to the Hague Convention is considered an addition to the Convention.  Signed on June 17, 1925 and entering into force on February 8, 1928, it permanently bans the use of all forms of chemical and [[biological warfare]] in its single section, entitled ''Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare''. The protocol grew out of the increasing public outcry against chemical warfare following the use of [[mustard gas]] and similar agents in [[World War I]], and fears that chemical and biological warfare could lead to horrific consequences in any future war. The protocol has since been augmented by the [[Biological Weapons Convention]] (1972) and the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] (1993).  .
