'''Atomic Spies''' and '''Atom Spies''' are terms that refer to various people in the [[United States]], [[Great Britain]], and [[Canada]] who are thought to have [[espionage|illicitly given information]] about [[nuclear weapon]]s production or design to the [[Soviet Union]] during [[World War II]] and the early [[Cold War]]. Exactly what was given, and whether everyone on the list gave it, is still a matter of some scholarly dispute, and in some cases what were originally seen as strong testimonies or confessions were admitted as fabricated in later years. Their work constitutes the most publicly well-known and well-documented case of [[nuclear espionage]] in the [[history of nuclear weapons]]. There was a movement among nuclear scientists to share the information with the world scientific community, but that was firmly quashed by the American government.  . 

The modern day sharing of nuclear technology with Iran, Libya, North Korea and possibly other regimes on the part of [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]] has yet to be fully explored. It is an open question whether the term "atom spy" will be applied to those operating outside the Cold War period, such as Khan and Argentine-American physicist [[Leonardo Mascheroni]].  . 

Whether the information significantly aided the speed of the [[Soviet atomic bomb project]] is also disputed. While some of the information given could have aided in developing a nuclear weapon, the manner in which the heads of the Soviet bomb project actually used the information has led scholars to doubt its role in increasing the speed of development. According to this account, [[Igor Kurchatov]] and [[Lavrenty Beria]] used the information primarily as a "check" against their own scientists' work and did not liberally share the information with them, distrusting both their own scientists as well as the espionage information. Later scholarship has also shown that the decisive brake on early Soviet development was not problems in weapons design but, as in the [[Manhattan Project]], the difficulty in procuring fissile materials, especially since the Soviet Union had no [[uranium]] deposits known when it began its program (unlike the United States).  . 

Confirmation about espionage work came from the [[VENONA]] project, which intercepted and decrypted Soviet intelligence reports sent during and after [[World War II]]. These provided clues to the identity of several spies at Los Alamos and elsewhere, some of whom have never been identified. Some of this information was available, but not usable in court for secrecy reasons, during the trials of the 1950s. As well records from Soviet archives, which were briefly opened to researchers after the fall of the Soviet Union, included more information about some spies.  .

*[[Morris Cohen (Soviet spy)|Morris Cohen]] &ndash; American, "Thanks to Cohen, designers of the Soviet atomic bomb got piles of technical documentation straight from the secret laboratory in Los Alamos," the newspaper [[Komsomolskaya Pravda]] said. Morris and his wife, Lona, served eight years in prison, less than half of their sentences before being released in a prisoner swap with The Soviet Union.  He died without revealing the name of the American scientist who helped pass vital information about the United States atomic bomb project. <ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Morris Cohen, 84, Soviet Spy Who Passed Atom Plans in 40's  |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE0DC1438F936A35754C0A963958260 |quote= Morris Cohen, an American who spied for the Soviet Union and was instrumental in relaying atomic bomb secrets to the Kremlin in the 1940s, has died, Russian newspapers reported today.

*[[Klaus Fuchs]] &ndash; German-born British theoretical physicist who worked with the British delegation at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] during the [[Manhattan Project]]. After Fuchs' [[confession (legal)|confession]] there was a [[trial (law)|trial]] that lasted less than 90 minutes, [[Lord Goddard]] [[sentence (law)|sentence]]d him to fourteen years' [[imprisonment]], the maximum for violating the [[Official Secrets Act]]. He escaped the charge of espionage because of the lack of independent evidence and because, at the time of the crime, the Soviet Union was not an enemy of Great Britain. <ref>A.M. Hornblum, 'The Invisible Harry Gold' (Yale University Press, 2010) kindle edition. locations 4030-37</ref> In December 1950 he was stripped of his [[British citizenship]]. He was released on June 23, 1959, after serving nine years and four months of his sentence at [[Wakefield (HM Prison)|Wakefield prison]].

*[[David Greenglass]] &ndash; an American machinist at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project. Greenglass confessed that he gave crude schematics of lab experiments to the Russians during World War II. Some aspects of his testimony against his sister and brother-in-law (the Rosenbergs, see below) are now thought to have been fabricated in an effort to keep his own wife, Ruth, from prosecution. Greenglass was sentenced to 15 years in prison, served 10 years, and later reunited with his wife. <ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Greenglass, in Prison, Vows to Kin He Told Truth About Rosenbergs |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00714FE3D59107A93CBA81788D85F478585F9 |quote=David Greenglass, serving fifteen years as a confessed atom spy, denied to members of his family recently that he had been coached by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the drawing of segments of the atom bomb, or that he had given perjured testimony against his sister, Mrs. Ethel Rosenberg, and her husband, Julius. |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=March 19, 1953 |accessdate=2008-07-07 }}</ref> . 

*[[Theodore Hall]] &ndash; a young American physicist at Los Alamos, whose identity as a spy was not revealed until very late in the 20th century. He was never tried for his espionage work, though he seems to have admitted to it in later years to reporters and to his family. <ref name=nytobit>{{cite news |first= Alan|last= Cowell|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Theodore Hall, Prodigy and Atomic Spy, Dies at 74  |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E7DE103AF933A25752C1A96F958260 |quote=Theodore Alvin Hall, who was the youngest physicist to work on the atomic bomb project at Los Alamos during World War II and was later identified as a Soviet spy, died on Nov. 1 in Cambridge, England, where he had become a leading, if diffident, pioneer in biological research.

Mr. Albright and Ms. Kunstel say Mr. Hall and a former Harvard roommate, Saville Sax, approached a Soviet trade company in New York in late 1944 and began supplying critical information about the atomic project. |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=November 10, 1999 |accessdate=2008-06-26 }}</ref> . 

*[[George Koval]] &ndash; The American born son of a [[Belarus|Belorussian]] emigrant family that returned to the Soviet Union where he was inducted into the Red Army and recruited into the [[GRU]] intelligence service.  He infiltrated the US Army and became a radiation health officer in the [[Special Engineering Detachment]].  Acting under the code name [[Dayton Project#Delmar|DELMAR]] he obtained information from [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge]] and the [[Dayton Project]] about the [[Urchin (detonator)]] used on the [[Fat Man]] plutonium bomb.  His work was not known to the west until he was posthumously recognized as a hero of the Russian Federation by [[Vladimir Putin]] in 2007.  .

*[[Allan Nunn May]] &ndash; A British citizen, he was one of the first Soviet spies uncovered during the cold war. He worked on the Manhattan Project and was betrayed by a [[Igor Gouzenko|Soviet defector in Canada]]. His was uncovered in 1946 and it led the United States to restrict the sharing of atomic secrets with Britain. On May 1, 1946, he was sentenced to ten years hard labour. He was released in 1952, after serving six and a half years. <ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Alan Nunn May, 91, Pioneer In Atomic Spying for Soviets  |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E0D91739F936A15752C0A9659C8B63 |quote= Alan Nunn May, a British atomic scientist who spied for the Soviet Union, died on Jan. 12 in Cambridge.

*[[Ethel and Julius Rosenberg]] &ndash; Americans who were involved in coordinating and recruiting an espionage network that included Ethel's brother, David Greenglass. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were tried for conspiracy to commit espionage, since the prosecution seemed to feel that there was not enough evidence to convict on espionage. Treason charges were not applicable, since the United States and the Soviet Union were allies at the time. The Rosenbergs denied all the charges but were convicted in a trial in which the prosecutor [[Roy Cohn]] said he was in daily secret contact with the judge, [[Irving Kaufman]]. Despite an international movement demanding clemency, and appeals to President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] by leading European intellectuals and the Pope, the Rosenbergs were executed at the height of the [[Korean War]]. President Eisenhower wrote to his son, serving in Korea, that if he spared Ethel (presumably for the sake of her children), then the Soviets would simply recruit their spies from among women. <ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Execution of the Rosenbergs |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/1953/jun/20/usa.fromthearchive |quote=Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed early this morning at Sing Sing Prison for conspiring to pass atomic secrets to Russia in World War II. |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=June 20, 1953 |accessdate=2008-06-24 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/spies/fuchs/1.html |title=The Rosenbergs: A Case of Love, Espionage, Deceit and Betray |quote=Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were charged with the crime of conspiracy to commit espionage, and tried under the Espionage Act of 1917. |publisher=[[TruTV]] |accessdate=2008-07-07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Execution of the Rosenbergs |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/1953/jun/20/usa.fromthearchive |quote=Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed early this morning at Sing Sing Prison for conspiring to pass atomic secrets to Russia in World War II. |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=June 20, 1953 |accessdate=2008-06-24 | location=London}}</ref> .
