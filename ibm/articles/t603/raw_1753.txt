'''Direct lobbying in the United States''' are direct methods used by lobbyists to influence United States [[legislature|legislative]] bodies. Interest groups from many sectors spend billions of dollars on lobbying. There are three lobbying laws in the U.S. They require that a [[lobbying]] entity must be registered, allow nonprofit organizations to lobby without losing their nonprofit status, require lobbying organizations to present quarterly reports about it, places restrictions on gifts [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] members can receive, and makes it mandatory for earmarks to be disclosed in expenditure bills. [[Revolving door (politics)|Revolving door]] also occurs in direct lobbying in the U.S. It occurs when former federal employees become lobbyists and former lobbyists become federal employees. The corporate media lobby has a strong relationship and influence on the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC). Many former FCC commissioners have become lobbyists after leaving FCC.  .

==Corporate media lobby==. 
The American corporate media lobby has been involved in the shaping of media ownership regulations since the early days of the industry. <ref>{{cite book|last=McChesney|first=Robert|title=Telecommunications, mass media, & democracy: the battle for|year=1993|publisher=Oxford|location=New York}}</ref> In that time, they have repeatedly sought their own interests by direct lobbying, in many cases at the expense of the public interest. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Everett|first=M.L.|title=FCC license renewal policy: the broadcasting lobby versus the public interest|journal=Southwestern Law Journal|year=1973|volume=27|pages=325â€“339}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=McChesney|first=Robert|title=The Problem of the Media|year=2004|publisher=Chatham House Publishers|location=Chatham, NJ}}</ref> . 

===Contemporary corporate media lobby===. 
[[Image:US-FCC-AltLogo.svg|thumb|300px|right|alt=logo of the federal communications commission|Logo of the Federal Communications Commission]]
Throughout most of its history, the FCC has been a relatively invisible part of the U.S. government, known mostly to industry stakeholders, lobbyists, and officials. <ref name="Digital Destiny">{{cite book|last=Chester|first=Jeff|title=Digital Destiny: New Media and the Future of Democracy|year=2007|publisher=New Press|location=New York}}</ref> With the general public not knowing its practices and responsibilities, this has given a tremendous advantage to those knowledgeable of the FCCâ€™s practices and organized enough to influence them. <ref name="Digital Destiny" /> Jeff Chester, the executive director of Center for Digital Democracy, "The FCC has long been the second home to a legion of (lawyers and lobbyists) [...] whose occupation is convincing the staff and commissioners to approve policies that benefit a particular company or industry."<ref name="Digital Destiny" /> . 

There is evidence that the FCC continues to be influenced by the corporate media lobby. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Obar|first=Jonathan A.|title=Beyond cynicism: A review of the FCCâ€™s reasoning for modifying the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule|journal=Communication Law & Policy|year=2009|volume=14|issue=4|pages=479â€“525}}</ref> The strong, direct relationships that have developed over the years between regulators and corporate media lobbyists, is essential to greater influence. <ref name="Zorack">{{cite book|last=Zorack|first=J.L.|title=The lobbying handbook|year=1990|location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref> It goes much deeper than the idea that the lobby has simply been around for a while. Members of the FCC have traditionally had strong connections to industry. As the job of an FCC commissioner or staffer is often highly technical, and specific knowledge of the dynamics of the telecommunications and media industries must be known, commissioners are often plucked out of high-paying jobs in the industry. History has shown, due to the fact that FCC Commissioners are appointed only to five-year terms, that there is a revolving door between the Commission and industry. <ref name="Digital Destiny" /> .

FCC commissioners often become influential lobbyists after their terms expire. Many of the lobbyists that frequent the FCCâ€™s office are, "not infrequently including ex-commissioners and ex-chairs"; Chester remarked that all of the former FCC commissioners in the last thirty years moved over into the lobbying sector soon after.{{sfn|Chester|2007|pp=47, 50}} . 

Politicians and businesses want the most knowledgeable and well-connected individuals working for them, which keeps the pool of potential hires quite small. The most influential lobbying strategy&nbsp;â€“ access&nbsp;â€“ is an advantage of the corporate media lobby. <ref name="Zorack" /> .
