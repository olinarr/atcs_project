'''Kay Bailey Hutchison''' (born '''Kathryn Ann Bailey'''; July 22, 1943) is the [[Senior Senator|senior]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Texas]]. 
She is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. In 2001, she was named one of the thirty most powerful women in America by ''[[Ladies Home Journal]]''. The first woman to represent Texas in the U.S. Senate, Hutchison also became the first Texas U.S. senator to receive more than four million votes in a single election.  . 

Hutchison is the most senior female Republican senator, and fifth most senior female senator, having assumed office in June 1993 behind Senators [[Barbara Mikulski]] (D-MD, 1987), [[Dianne Feinstein]] (D-CA, 1992), [[Barbara Boxer]] (D-CA, Jan. 1993), and [[Patty Murray]] (D-WA, Jan. 1993).  . 

==Early life==. 
Hutchison was born '''Kathryn Ann Bailey''' in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], the daughter of Kathryn Ella (née Sharp) and Allan Abner Bailey, Jr.,<ref>[http://www.wargs.com/political/bailey.html Ancestry of Kay Bailey Hutchison<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> an insurance agent. She has two brothers, Allan and Frank. Hutchison grew up in [[La Marque, Texas]].  . 

She married her first husband, John Pierce Parks, a medical student, on April 8, 1967; they [[divorce]]d in 1969. <ref>{{cite web|author=Lawrence Kestenbaum |url=http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/hutchison-hyche.html#R9M0J1L4H |title=Index to Politicians: Hutchison to Hyche |publisher=The Political Graveyard |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> She married her present (second) husband, [[Ray Hutchison]], in Dallas on March 16, 1978. <ref>[http://www.hillnews.com/news/051904/marriage.aspx ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> They have two adopted children: Kathryn Bailey and Houston Taylor, both adopted in 2001. She also has two stepdaughters, Brenda and Julie, from her husband's previous marriage. Ray Hutchison is a former member of the Texas Legislature, a former state Republican chairman, and ran an unsuccessful bid for the Texas governorship, having lost the Republican nomination in 1978 to [[Bill Clements]], a senior partner with the law firm of [[Vinson & Elkins]], of Dallas.  . 

Hutchison and her family have their primary residence in Dallas, where her children attend school. <ref>Manu Raju, [http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0109/17474_Page2.html "Hutchison pressured to stay in Senate"], Politico, January 15, 2009. </ref> She has a second house in [[Virginia]], where she lives when the Senate is in session.

She is a supporter of the [[Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation]] where she is an honorary board member. <ref>[http://www.multiplemyeloma.org/foundation/1.05.php MMRF Honorary Board]</ref> . 

She received her [[bachelor of arts]] degree from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1962, where she was a [[cheerleader]] and a sister of [[Pi Beta Phi]] [[Fraternity]]. She received her [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from the [[University of Texas School of Law]] in 1967. Following her graduation from law school, she was the legal and political correspondent for [[KPRC-TV]] in [[Houston]]. Hired by [[Ray Miller (Texas journalist)|Ray Miller]], host of the long-running ''[[The Eyes of Texas (TV series)|The Eyes of Texas]]'' [[anthology series|anthology]] [[television series|series]], Hutchison was the first female onscreen newswoman in Texas.  . 

==Early career==. 
In 1972, Hutchison was elected to the [[Texas House of Representatives]] from a district in Houston. She served until 1976. She was vice-chairman of the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] from 1976 to 1978. She was a candidate for the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1982 for the [[Dallas]]-based 3rd District, but was defeated in the primary by [[Steve Bartlett]]. She temporarily left politics and became a bank executive and businesswoman.  . 

Kay Bailey Hutchison was a bank executive of a failed bank in Texas and met and married her second husband Ray Hutchison who was the chairman of the Texas Republican Party in 1976 but left in 1977 to pursue his gubernatorial campaign. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.famoustexans.com/kaybaileyhutchison.htm |title=Kay Bailey Hutchison |publisher=Famoustexans.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> In 1978, Ray Hutchison lost the nomination to Bill Clements by a lopsided vote of 115,345 (72.8 percent) to 38,268 (24.2 percent). Kay met Ray when they were both Texas legislators, and Kay's interest in politics grew exponentially. Ray is currently a senior attorney at the largest and most powerful law firm and lobbying organization in Houston, Vinson & Elkins. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vinson-elkins.com/lawyers/RayHutchison.aspx |title=Vinson & Elkins LLP - Lawyers - Ray Hutchison |publisher=Vinson-elkins.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> . 

==Personal wealth==. 
Hutchison’s husband, Ray, a prominent Dallas [[bond attorney]], makes slightly less than a half million dollars a year in combined salary and deferred compensation, records provided by her campaign show. A big stake in ExxonMobil, valued at between $250,000 and $500,000, along with other stock holdings and equity investments, have also helped provide the family yearly dividend income of about $60,000 a year since 2001, records show. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.taragana.com/n/texas-sen-kay-bailey-hutchisons-wealth-fueled-by-investments-husbands-income-records-show-207320/ |title=Texas Sen.

===Elections===. 
====1993====. 
{{Main|United States Senate special election in Texas, 1993}} . 

Hutchison was elected [[Texas State Treasurer]] in 1990 and served until June 1993 when she ran against Senator [[Bob Krueger]] for the right to complete the last two years of [[Lloyd Bentsen]]'s term. Bentsen had resigned in January 1993 to become [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] in the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration. Krueger had been appointed by Texas Governor [[Ann Richards]] to fill the seat until a replacement was elected.  . 

A field of 24 candidates sought to fill Bentsen's unexpired term, in the May 1993 special election. <ref>http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/external/pre-election/profilesstates/TX.html?SITE=OKTULELN&SECTION=POLITICS&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT</ref> The top two vote-getters were Hutchison (593,338, or 29 percent) and Krueger (593,239, also 29 percent). Two conservative Republican congressmen, [[Joe Barton]] of [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] (284,135 or 13.9 percent) and [[Jack Fields]] of [[Houston]] (277,560, or 13.6 percent) split [[pro-life]] voters, but even their combined totals, 561,693, would have placed neither in the runoff. A fifth candidate, Democrat [[Richard W. Fisher]], son-in-law of Republican former U.S. Representative [[James M. Collins]], polled 165,564 votes (8.1 percent); the remaining candidates had about 6 percent combined. Running far behind the pack was the Houston conservative [[political activist]] and former crusading journalist [[Clymer Wright]], father of his city's 1991 term-limits initiative. [[Lou Zaeske]], an engineer from [[Bryan, Texas|Bryan]], who in 1988 had spearheaded the [[English-only movement]] in Texas, polled barely 2,000 votes.  . 

During the campaign Krueger charged that Hutchison was a "[[country club Republican]]" and insensitive to the feelings of minorities. <ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFD91030F930A35755C0A965958260&scp=4&sq=%22country+club+republican&st=nyt Senator Trails in Texas, and Slugs Alone] [[New York Times]] 1993-06-03</ref> In January, the ''Houston Chronicle'' reported that both Hutchison and Fields had promised to serve a maximum of two six-year terms in the Senate as part of her support for term limit legislation for members of Congress. In April, the ''Dallas Morning News'' reported that Hutchison had repeated her pledge to serve only two terms in the U.S. Senate, if elected, and had also said term limits ought to cover all senators, including Senator [[Phil Gramm]] (Republican), who had been elected in 1984 and re-elected in 1990. (He would stay in the Senate until 2002.) The term-limits legislation never passed, and Hutchison has said that she would not leave the Senate in the absence of such legislation, because doing so would unilaterally hurt Texas at the expense of other states in the seniority-driven institution.  . 

After the initial voting, most of the Barton and Fields voters switched to Hutchison, who won the runoff, 1,188,716 (67.3 percent) to 576,538 (32.7 percent). Lower turnout in the runoff resulted in a decrease in Krueger's vote total, by 17,000. Hutchison became the first woman to represent Texas in the U.S. Senate.  . 

Following Hutchison's election in 1993, Texas has had two sitting Republican U.S. senators.  . 

====1993 indictments for misconduct as Texas Treasurer ==== . 

On June 10, 1993, shortly after the special election victory, [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County]] authorities, led by Democratic district attorney [[Ronnie Earle]], raided Hutchison's offices at the State Treasury. Earle failed to obtain a search warrant in conducting that raid. <ref name="NYTevidenceP1">[http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/12/us/fight-over-evidence-results-in-acquittal-of-senator-in-texas.html?pagewanted=3&src=pm Fight Over Evidence Results in Acquittal Of Senator in Texas, [[New York Times]],  February 12, 1994]</ref> Subsequently, after two other grand jury indictments were thrown out, Hutchison was indicted a 3rd time <ref name="NYTevidenceP2">[http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/12/us/fight-over-evidence-results-in-acquittal-of-senator-in-texas.html?pagewanted=2&src=pm Fight Over Evidence Results in Acquittal Of Senator in Texas, [[New York Times]],  February 12, 1994]</ref> by a Texas [[grand jury]] in September 1993 for official misconduct and records tampering. Hutchison stated that she was the innocent victim of a politically motivated prosecutor. Earle had attempted to get Democratic Governor [[Ann Richards]] to appoint Earle to the US Senate seat, to which Hutchison was ultimately elected, but he has denied that his legal actions against Hutchison were politically motivated. <ref>[http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-02-06/news/9402050347_1_hutchison-s-democratic-opponent-texas-state-treasurer-employees-and-equipment Trial To Begin For Texas Senator], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', February 6, 1994. </ref> . 

====1994 acquittal ==== . 

The case against Hutchison was heard before State District Judge John Onion in February 1994. Pre-trail motions included a Motion to Quash evidence Earle obtained without a warrant when raiding the Treasurer's office. During pre-trial proceedings, the judge announced that he would make no rulings on the admissibility of evidence prior to the trial. That blocked Earle's options as to the admissibility of the evidence. <ref>[http://articles.philly.com/1994-02-17/news/25857345_1_ruling-evidence-judge-john-onion Suppression Of Evidence Also Suppresses The Truth], ''[[philly.com]]'', February 17, 1994. </ref> Following Onion's ruling, Earle declined to proceed with his case. <ref name="NYTevidenceP1"/> Onion swore in a jury and directed the jury to acquit Hutchison, since Earle chose not to present evidence. <ref name="NYTevidenceP1"/> The acquittal barred any future prosecution of Hutchison. <ref name="NYTevidenceP2"/> . 

====1994 election====. 
{{Main|United States Senate election in Texas, 1994}} . 

In 1994, the election for her first full term, Hutchison received 2,604,281 votes (60.8 percent) to 1,639,615 votes (38.3 percent) cast for Democrat [[Richard W. Fisher]], the son-in-law of the late Republican Congressman [[James M. Collins]], who had also run in the special election the year before.  . 

====2000====. 
{{Main|United States Senate election in Texas, 2000}} . 

In 2000 she defeated Democrat Gene Kelly, with 4,082,091 (65 percent) to 2,030,315 (32.2 percent). She carried 237 of the 254 counties, including one of the most Democratic counties, [[Webb County]] ([[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]]). This was the only time since the early 1900s that Webb County had supported a Republican candidate for any office on a partisan ballot. More than four million Texans voted for Hutchison that year — still the record highest number of actual votes ever cast in Texas for a non-presidential candidate (George W. Bush received 4,526,917 votes in Texas in the 2004 election).  . 

====2006====. 
{{Main|United States Senate election in Texas, 2006}} . 

Speculation began in 2004 that Hutchison would run for [[Governor of Texas]] in 2006, challenging current Governor [[Rick Perry]] in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[primary election|primary]]. However, on June 17, 2005, Hutchison announced that she would seek reelection to the Senate instead, reneging on an earlier promise to a two-term limit. Many political analysts speculated that she did not believe she could defeat Perry in the GOP primary because of his popularity among Christian conservatives, while her Senate seat was unlikely to face a serious threat.  . 

Hutchison's Democratic opponent in the November 2006 [[general election]] was former [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] attorney and mediator [[Barbara Ann Radnofsky]] (born July 8, 1956), who had not previously run for public office. Radnofsky received 44 percent of the vote in the primary and won a runoff election against [[Gene Kelly (politician)|Gene Kelly]] with 60 percent of the vote. Kelly had been the unsuccessful Democratic nominee against Hutchison in 2000. [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] Scott Lanier Jameson (born July 1, 1966), a real estate consultant from [[Plano, Texas|Plano]], also ran for the seat.  . 

Radnofsky faced an uphill battle in a state that has not elected a Democrat statewide since 1994, as [[George W. Bush]]'s landslide reelection as governor in 1998 had helped carry Republicans into all the other statewide offices. In the August 2006 Rasmussen poll, Hutchison led her opponent by 30 percentage points — 61 to 31. <ref>[http://www.rasmussenreports.com/2006/State%20Polls/August%202006/TexasSenate.htm ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> The Survey USA Poll, which is not a head-to-head matchup, but only lists approval ratings of incumbents, found Hutchison with a 61 percent approval rating. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=ca95974e-73b1-4317-ab3e-791e5ece016d |title=SurveyUSA News Poll #9993 |publisher=Surveyusa.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> The Zogby poll, in contrast, showed a closer result, but still showed Hutchison with a 17.3 percent lead — the highest of any incumbent Republican Zogby tracks. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/info-flash06.html?project=elections06-ft&h=495&w=778&hasAd=1&mod=blogs | work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref> The authors stated "...Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, who got 65 percent of the vote in 2000, is a safe bet to win a third term." . 

On election night 2006, Hutchison won re-election to another term, winning 2,661,789 votes (61.7%). Radnofsky won 1,555,202 votes (36.04%). <ref>http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist.exe</ref> Radnofsky only won in base Democratic areas, carrying only border counties with strong Hispanic majorities, such as [[El Paso County, Texas|El Paso]] and [[Webb County, Texas|Webb]] ([[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]]) and in [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County]] ([[Austin, Texas|Austin]]). Hutchison won everything else, having won majorities in 236 of the state's 254 counties.  . 

==2010 gubernatorial election==. 
{{Main|Texas gubernatorial election, 2010}}
On August 17, 2009, Senator Hutchison formally announced that she was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate for [[Governor of Texas]] and positioned herself as a moderate alternative to Governor [[Rick Perry]]. Perry criticized Hutchison for her [[pro-choice]] position and received endorsements from social conservatives in the state. <ref name="tfk_20090817"> .

|accessdate=2009-08-17}}</ref> Although Hutchison led Perry in polls taken in early 2009 and was perceived by many to be the front-runner in the race, by the fall her lead had evaporated and she consistently trailed the incumbent in the final months before the primary. Hutchison accumulated a list of high profile endorsements that included former U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]], former U.S. Secretary of State [[James Baker]], former U.S. Vice President [[Dick Cheney]], legendary baseball player Nolan Ryan, and several current and former congressmen and Cabinet secretaries. However, Hutchison lost the primary to Perry, 31 to 53 percent, with the remainder of the vote going to [[Debra Medina]], a [[dark horse]] candidate with ties to the [[Tea Party movement]].  . 

==Political Positions==. 
{{Wikiquote}}
Hutchison serves on the following Senate committees: [[U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations]]; [[U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation|Commerce, Science and Transportation]]; [[U.S. Senate Committee on Rules and Administration|Rules and Administration]]; [[U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs|Veterans' Affairs]]. During her time in the Senate, Hutchison has been a strong supporter of [[NASA]].  . 

[[File:Kay Bailey Hutchison.jpg|thumb|left|Hutchison speaking.]]
In June 2000, Hutchison and her Senate colleagues coauthored ''Nine and Counting: The Women of the Senate''. In 2004, her book, ''American Heroines: The Spirited Women Who Shaped Our Country'', was published.  . 

From 2001 to 2007, Hutchison served as Chairwoman of the Senate Republican Conference (caucus), making her the fifth-ranking Republican in the Senate behind Majority Leader [[Bill Frist]], Majority Whip [[Mitch McConnell]] and conference chairman [[Rick Santorum]], and Policy Chairman [[Jon Kyl]]. In 2007, Hutchison succeeded [[Jon Kyl]] as the [[Republican Policy Committee Chairman of the United States Senate|Policy Chair for Senate Republicans]], the fourth ranking leadership position in the Republican caucus behind Minority Leader McConnell, Minority Whip, and conference chairman Kyl.  . 

The ''[[National Journal]]'' ranked Hutchison as follows in its 2004 rankings, which are based on various key votes relating to economic policy, social policy, and foreign policy: "Economic: 26% Liberal, 73% Conservative; Social: 38% Liberal, 60% Conservative; Foreign: 0% Liberal, 67% Conservative. Although a loyal Conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] she has been known to cross over to the other side on a few issues. She is more likely to do this than either [[Phil Gramm]] or his successor [[John Cornyn]]." A poll that was released on June 19, 2007, shows that Hutchison has an approval rating of 58%, with 34% disapproving. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=59e13048-8ca9-4fc8-9302-dc8681fe64b0 |title=SurveyUSA News Poll #12245 |publisher=Surveyusa.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> . 

The National Journal's opinion is disputed by many Texas Republicans and Tea Party members, however. Konni Burton, a member of the Northeast Tarrant Tea Party steering committee, said "She personifies everything that the Tea Party is fighting. She is a Republican, but when you check her votes on many issues, they are not ones that conservatives are happy with."<ref>{{cite news|last=Tinsley|first=Anna|title=Tea Party candidates vow to take on Hutchison is she seeks another term|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2010/12/04/2680066/tea-party-candidates-vow-to-take.html|newspaper=Fort Worth Star-Telegram|date=4 December 2010}}</ref> "On fiscal issues, she is more loyal to her friends and special interests than to the people of Texas," according to Adrian Murray, president of the grassroots 912 Project Fort Worth.  . 

Hutchison broke ranks with her Republican colleagues and opposed an attempt to stall the Democrats' health-care bill in the Senate. <ref>[http://www.dentonrc.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/texassouthwest/stories/DN-teaparty_22tex.ART.State.Edition1.ae7e73.html Tea Party groups protest Hutchison's moves on health care bill] BENNING, TOM and GILLMAN, TODD J.

===Abortion===. 
Hutchison supports the legality of [[abortion]] and considers herself [[pro-choice]]. She has, however, frequently voted for restricting abortion. Her average score from the [[National Right to Life Committee|NRLC]] between the years of 1997 and 2010 is 93%, with her highest score being 100% and lowest being 75%. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capwiz.com/nrlc/home/ |title=Federal Legislation - Legislative Action Center |publisher=Capwiz.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> NARAL Pro-Choice Texas executive director Sara Cleveland once said, "by our definition, Sen.

While in the Texas House of Representatives (1973 to 1977), Hutchison worked, along with [[Sarah Weddington]] (the attorney who won ''Roe v. Wade''), to protect [[rape]] victims from having their names published.  . 

===DC Personal Protection Act===. 
Hutchison proposed the "District of Columbia Personal Protection Act," which drew 31 cosponsors in the [[United States Senate]], while drawing 157 cosponsors from the House. This bill would have protected gun rights of DC citizens by dismantling the handgun bans the city had in place for thirty years. DC's law states that one may not possess a [[rifle]] or [[shotgun]] unless it is in disassembled and inoperative form, and may not possess [[pistols]] in any form. The law was recently{{2008|date=August 2011}} struck down in a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, [[District of Columbia v. Heller]].  . 

===Education===. 
Hutchison is a strong supporter of [[single-sex education]] in public schools. In 2001, she worked with Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] (D-NY) to write provisions into the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] (specifically sections 5131.a.23 and 5131c) authorizing single-sex education in public schools. Section 5131c required the Department of Education to write new regulations facilitating single-sex classrooms; this provision led to the publication of new regulations by the Department of Education in 2006 which do in fact facilitate single-sex education in public schools. She is a supporter of the U.S. Public Service Academy.  . 

===Environmental record===. 
In 2006, Hutchison received more campaign contributions from members of large oil and gas corporations than any other member of Congress. <ref>[http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/JubaksJournal/BigOils10FavoriteMembersOfCongress.aspx?wa=wsignin1.0 Big Oil's 10 favorite members of Congress - MSN Money<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 2005, Hutchison voted against prohibiting oil leasing in Alaska's [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]], and has supported legislation promoting drilling in the refuge in 2002 and 2003. In 2005 she also voted against including oil and gas smokestacks in the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]'s [[mercury (element)|mercury]] regulations. <ref>[http://www.pubtheo.com/page.asp?pid=1165 Public Theology: Senate Vote on Arctic National Wildlife Refuge<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.ontheissues.org/senate/Kay_Bailey_Hutchison.htm Kay Bailey Hutchison on the Issues<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 1999, she voted to remove funding for renewable and solar energy, although she has more recently stated she supports the development of alternative energy sources. <ref>[http://www.media.rice.edu/media/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW&ID=1913&SnID=2 Rice University | News & Media<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> According to the [[League of Conservation Voters]] environmental scorecard, Hutchison received a rating of zero — the lowest possible score — in the 104th Congress. <ref>[http://www.sustainabilityinstitute.org/dhm_archive/index.php?display_article=vn636lcved Environmental Zeroes and Heroes of the 104th Congress<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, they have since upgraded her to a grade of 18% in the 110th Congress<ref>{{cite web|url=http://capwiz.com/lcv/bio/keyvotes/?id=552&congress=1111&lvl=C |title=2009 National Environmental Scorecard |publisher=Capwiz.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> . 

===Term limits===. 
Hutchison has proposed limiting Texas governors to two four-year terms.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} She promised not to serve more than two terms as U.S. Senator, but then changed her mind and ran for a third term. She has made many statements concerning whether she would continue in office which were subsequently refuted by herself when she decided to remain in power as U.S. Senator. <ref>{{cite web|last=Schwartz |first=Barry |url=http://www.perrspectives.com/blog/archives/001667.htm |title=Hutchison and the Republican Hypocrisy on Term Limits |publisher=PERRspectives |date=2009-11-13 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> . 

===Earmarks and appropriations===. 
Hutchison supports the practice of [[Earmark (politics)|earmarking]] as a way to bring Federal government money to her constituents. Hutchison, through her assignment on the Senate's appropriations committee, has been influential in directing Federal funds to projects in her state. In FY 2008 and FY 2009, Hutchison sponsored or co-sponsored 281 earmarks totaling almost $500 million. In an interview with the [[Austin American-Statesman]], Hutchison expressed her pride in the practice as a way to, "garner Texans' fair share of their tax dollars." <ref name="statesman.com">{{cite web|last=Embry |first=Jason |url=http://www.statesman.com/news/content/region/legislature/stories/2009/09/28/0928gopgov.html |title=Austin news, sports, weather, Longhorns, business |publisher=Statesman.com |date=2009-09-28 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> . 

Hutchison's earmarks and appropriations have been criticized as [[Pork barrel|pork barrel projects or pet projects]] by the non-partisan [[Watchdog journalism|government watchdog]] group [[Citizens Against Government Waste]]. CAGW recognized Hutchison's efforts by naming her "Porker of the Month" in October 2009, based on her extensive legislative history, in addition to her request for 149 such pork projects worth $1.6 billion in FY 2010. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cagw.org/site/PageServer?pagename=news_porkerofthemonth_2009_October |title=Citizens Against Government Waste: porkerofthemonth |publisher=Cagw.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> . 

Hutchison continues to support earmarks despite a moratorium called for by the Republican Party in both houses of Congress. She is a strong supporter of the Space Launch System, also known as the Senate Launch System, the single largest earmark in the Federal budget<ref>{{cite web|last=Simberg|first=Rand|title=Blame Congress and Pork, Not NASA|url=http://www.openmarket.org/2011/09/23/blame-congress-and-pork-not-nasa/}}</ref> and possibly the single large earmark in US history. The SLS earmark has been opposed by fiscal conservative groups, including the Tea Party.,<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilkinson|first=Everett|title=TEA Party Catches Congress Hiding Earmark In Space|url=http://teapartywire.com/blog/2011/05/15/press-release-tea-party-catches-congress-hiding-earmark-in-space/|publisher=Tea Party Wire}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Gasser|first=Andrew|title=Are Republican Senators Trying to Kill NASA?|url=http://www.teainspace.com/are-republican-senators-trying-to-kill-nasa/|publisher=Tea Party in Space}}</ref>  as well as space-exploration advocacy groups. Congressman Tom McClintock (R-CA) has expressed "serious concerns with NASA's attempt to avoid holding a full and open competition to acquire the SLS." Rep. McClintock "stringly believe[s] that such a de facto sole source award would be a violation of the 1984 Competition in Contracting Act." Rep. McClintock has asked the Government Accountability Office to investigate the SLS earmark. <ref>{{cite web|last=McClintock|first=Tom|title=Letter to Gene Dodaro, Comptroller General of the United States|url=http://www.teapartyinspace.org/sites/default/files/McClintock%20to%20GAO%2022Sep11_0.pdf}}</ref>     . 

Ironically, the SLS earmark primarily benefits the Marshall Space Flight Center, which is not located in Hutchison's home state. To fund SLS development, Hutchison supports cutting funds for NASA's Commercial Crew and Cargo Program, which would rely on private companies such as Space Exploration Technologies and Blue Origin (both of which have significant operations in Texas). Critics contend that building SLS would increase the cost of access to space and result in long-term cutbacks in NASA's human spaceflight program, based in Houston, Texas.  . 

Immediately after the first successful test flight of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, Hutchison issued a statement dismissing the value of SpaceX, which has approximately 10% of its workforce in Texas and is one of the fastest growing employers in the state. "This first successful test flight of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket is a belated sign that efforts to develop modest commercial space cargo capabilities are showing some promising signs," Hutchison said. "While this test flight was important, the program to demonstrate commercial cargo and crew transport capabilities, which I support, was intended to enhance not replace NASA's own proven abilities to deliver critical cargo and humans to low Earth orbit. Make no mistake, even this modest success is more than a year behind schedule, and the project deadlines of other private space companies continue to slip as well. This test does not change the fact that commercial space programs are not ready to close the gap in human spaceflight if the space shuttle is retired this year with no proven replacement capability and the Constellation program is simultaneously canceled as the president proposes."<ref>{{cite web|last=Alan|first=Boyle|title=SpaceX fans and foes speak out|url=http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2010/06/04/4465072-spacex-fans-and-foes-speak-out|work=Cosmic Log|publisher=MSNBC}}</ref>  . 

[[Citizens Against Government Waste]] has consistently opposed the SLS earmark as well. According to CAGW, "The private sector should be relied upon to fulfill the U.S. mission in space. If the U.S. has a requirement for a heavy-lift launch vehicle to carry beyond low-Earth orbit, there should be a new, full and open competition to determine the best path forward." <ref>{{cite web|title=Prime Cuts Summary: June 2011|url=http://www.cagw.org/assets/reports/primecuts-_web.pdf|publisher=Citizens Against Government Waste}}</ref> . 

Other Republicans have criticized the SLS earmark, which has even become an issue in the Presidential primary. At a town meeting hosted by the Dallas Tea Party, Presidential Candidate and former House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] criticized politicians supporting the Space Launch System, "I think it is disgraceful the way getting into space has been turned into a political pork-barrel. It’s an abuse of the taxpayer and an abuse of America’s future.”<ref>{{cite web|title=Newt Gingrich calls Space Launch System "disgraceful" pork|url=http://spacefrontier.org/2011/10/21/newt-gingrich-calls-space-launch-system-disgraceful-pork/|publisher=Space Frontier Foundation}}</ref> . 

===Financial reform===. 
When questioned on [[Fox Business Network]] whether she was worried about her constituents turning on her for continuing to block financial reform of banks and financial institutions, Hutchison said, "If we just vote by polls that's wrong, we have to do what's right. This is not a Wall Street Bill this is a mainstream Bill that needs to cover throughout the financial industry. The problem was not mainstream banks. We need to make sure that we don't over-regulate the mainstream banks so they can't loan to small business." <ref>{{cite web|author=“” |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT73LaPjxrQ |title=Kay Bailey Hutchison on Fox Business Discussing Financial Reform |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-04-28 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> Hutchison decided to vote for Senate Republican amendments to the financial reform bill before eventually voting against HR 4173, the [[Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009]], on May 20, 2010. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/h001016/ | work=The Washington Post}}</ref> . 

===Bailouts===. 
Senator Hutchison voted for the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]].,<ref name="statesman.com"/> which authorized the creation of the [[Troubled Assets Relief Program]].  . 

==Political future==. 
Hutchison announced her intention to resign her Senate post in the autumn of 2009 in order to challenge Texas Governor [[Rick Perry|Perry]] for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nomination. <ref name="saxn_resign_senate">{{cite web|title=Hutchison set to declare for governor today|work=[[San Antonio Express News]]|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local_news/53371477.html|date=17 Aug 2009|accessdate=2009-08-17}}</ref> State Republican Chairman [[Cathie Adams]] later called upon Hutchison to clarify when she would vacate the Senate so that other Republican candidates can make preparation for their races. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://rickvskay.blogspot.com/2009/10/cathie-adams-refuses-to-withdraw.html|title=Cathie Adams refuses to withdraw endorsement of Rick (Perry)|publisher=ricvskay.blogspot.com, October 26, 2009|accessdate=October 28, 2009}}</ref> . 

On November 13, 2009, Hutchison announced that she would not resign from the Senate seat until after the March 2, 2010 primary. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2010270476_apustexasgovernorhutchison.html |title=Hutchison won't resign seat before Texas primary |first=Jay |last=Root |date=November 13, 2010 | work=The Seattle Times |agency=The Associated Press }}</ref> On March 31, 2010, she announced her intention to serve out her third term. <ref>{{cite news |title=Texas GOP Sen.

On January 13, 2011, after some discussion about whether she would change her mind,<ref>{{cite news |title=Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison undecided on running, but foes aren't |first=Tom |last=Benning |work=Dallasnews.com |publisher=[[Dallas Morning News]] |date=May 28, 2010 |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/national-politics/20100528-Sen-Kay-Bailey-Hutchison-undecided-1219.ece }}</ref> Hutchison announced she would not seek re-election in [[United States Senate election in Texas, 2012|2012]]. <ref>{{cite news |title=Sen.

On June 22, 2011, Hutchison told [[Chris Matthews]] on ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'' that she had pondered running for president, but said she could not run in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 election]] due to having two 10-year-old children. <ref>http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036697/#43501814</ref> .
