[[Sarah Palin]] has expressed her positions on a wide range of political issues during her career in the public eye. <!--if you want to add to the lead go right ahead - but as the article stands right now(5/28/10, the TOC works very well as a summary of the major points in the article)--> . 

==Social and legal issues==. 
===Religion in public life===. 
Despite attending a [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] church which supported [[abstinence]] from [[alcohol]], Palin, then on the [[Wasilla, Alaska|Wasilla]] City Council, cast the deciding vote against restricting the hours during which the city's bars could operate. According to Rev. Gene Straatmeyer, a local [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] minister, Palin told him during a City Council hearing, "'I go to Assembly of God Church and I am a Sunday school teacher there and I see no relationship between my [[Christianity|Christian]] faith and what hours the bars close.'" Straatmeyer continued, "She felt it was out of line for me to testify on behalf of the church groups I represented." The effort to restrict bar hours was intended to combat [[driving under the influence|drunken driving]] and [[domestic violence|spousal abuse]], but Palin felt that restricting bar hours would hurt the local economy. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-10-05/news/0810040312_1_sarah-palin-mayor-of-tiny-wasilla-stambaugh | work=Chicago Tribune | first1=Andrew | last1=Zajac | first2=Bob | last2=Secter | title=Sarah Palin's opposition to bar crackdown surprised some | date=October 5, 2008}}</ref> . 

During a candidates' debate for governor in 2006, when asked how she would feel if a church pastor endorsed a candidate for governor, Palin said that she "would never support any government effort to stifle our freedom of religion or freedom of expression or freedom of speech," but would caution the pastor that the endorsement could result in "frustration" and  "fewer dollars in the offering plate". <ref name="Ontheissues">{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/Sarah_Palin_Principles_+_Values.htm|title=Sarah Palin on Principles & Values|work=[[On the Issues]]|accessdate=May 28, 2010}}</ref> . 

In 2006, Palin told the [[Associated Press]] that her personal beliefs would not dictate her public policies, adding that she was "not one to be out there preaching and forcing my views on anyone else."<ref name="CNN 2008-09-12">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/08/palin.pastor/index.html|title=Pastor: GOP may be downplaying Palin's religious beliefs|first=Randi|last=Kaye|work=ElectionCenter2008|publisher=CNN|date=September 12, 2008|accessdate=May 28, 2010}}</ref> . 

During a debate for Governor of Alaska in 2006, Palin said she was a proponent of teaching both [[creationism]] and [[evolution]] in the Alaska [[Public school (government funded)#United States|public schools]]. The following day she said: "It doesn't have to be part of the curriculum", and that she would not push to have it added. She also said she would not use religion or views on creationism as a [[Litmus test (politics)|litmus test]] in picking members of the Alaska [[Board of Education]]. (Under  state law, the Board  of Education determines the content of the public schools' curriculum.)<ref name="kizzia">{{cite news|author=Kizzia, Tom|url=http://www.adn.com/sarah-palin/background/story/217111.html|title='Creation science' enters the race: Governor: Palin is only candidate to suggest it should be discussed in schools.|newspaper=[[Anchorage Daily News]]|date=October 27, 2006|accessdate=May 28, 2010}}</ref> Palin has also said that evolution "should be taught as an accepted principle. And, as you know, I say that also as the daughter of a school teacher, a science teacher, who has really instilled in me a respect for science. It should be taught in our schools. And I won't deny that I see the hand of God in this beautiful creation that is Earth. But that is not part of the state policy or a local curriculum in a school district.

While Governor, Palin vetoed public funding for private, Christian schools, saying after the fact, "I'm a Christian.... [The funding is] unconstitutional. It's illegal. You can't do that. I had to go in there and veto those things and, of course, was accused then of being, 'Oh, you're not a real conservative or a real Republican. Otherwise, you would have fought for that.'

In the wake of the Supreme Court decision ''[[Snyder v.

===Birth status of Barack Obama===. 
In a December 3, 2009, interview with [[Rusty Humphries]], Palin was asked about President [[Barack Obama]]'s [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|birth certificate]].  She stated, "I think the public rightfully is still making it an issue. I don't have a problem with that. I don't know if I would have to bother to make it an issue, because I think that members of the electorate still want answers."  When asked if people had a legitimate reason to question the certificate, she stated, "I think it's a fair question, just like I think past association and past voting records&nbsp;– all of that is fair game."  She also stated that the questions were 'fair play' because, "the weird [[conspiracy theory]] freaky thing that people talk about that [[Trig Palin|Trig]] isn't my real son&nbsp;– 'You need to produce his birth certificate, you need to prove that he's your kid,' which we have done.  Maybe we can reverse that."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1209/Palin_Obama_birth_certificate_a_fair_question.html |title=Palin: Obama birth certificate 'a fair question' |last=Smith |first=Ben |date=December 3, 2009 |work=politico.com |publisher=Capitol News Company |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}</ref> . 

Palin later clarified her position in a Facebook posting by stating: "Voters have every right to ask candidates for information if they so choose. I’ve pointed out that it was seemingly fair game during the 2008 election for many on the left to badger my doctor and lawyer for proof that Trig is in fact my child. Conspiracy-minded reporters and voters had a right to ask... which they have repeatedly. But at no point&nbsp;– not during the campaign, and not during recent interviews&nbsp;– have I asked the president to produce his birth certificate or suggested that he was not born in the United States."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=188707498434 |title=Stupid Conspiracies |last=Palin |first=Sarah |date=December 3, 2009 |work=facebook.com |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}</ref> .

===Same-sex unions===. 
While campaigning for election as [[Governorship of Sarah Palin|Governor of Alaska]] in 2006, Palin declared that she supported the [[Alaska Ballot Measure 2 (1998)|1998 Alaska constitutional amendment]] that proposed adding "...a marriage may exist only between one man and one woman" to the [[Constitution of Alaska|Alaskan constitution]] in order to ensure that [[same-sex marriage]] did not become legal in that state.  .

And I’m not an advocate for that. However, I think that we need to prioritize our law enforcement efforts. And if somebody’s gonna smoke a joint in their house and not do anybody else any harm, then perhaps there are other things that our cops should be looking at to engage in and try to clean up some of the other problems that we have in society that are appropriate for law enforcement to do and not concentrate on such a, relatively speaking, minimal problem that we have in the country."<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNxJZJGzcOQ (At 15:56)].

In a December 3, 2009, radio interview with [[Rusty Humphries]], Palin was asked her position on illegal aliens and closing the [[Mexico – United States border]], to which she replied, "We must close the border.

On the April 28, 2010 episode of ''[[Hannity]]'', Palin expressed support for the [[Arizona SB1070|Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act]], which makes it a state misdemeanor crime for an [[alien (law)|alien]] to be in Arizona without carrying registration documents required by federal law, and requires police to make an attempt, when practicable, to determine a person's immigration status if there is reasonable suspicion that the person is an illegal alien, during a police stop for some other offense. <ref>{{cite web|author=By Sheya |url=http://www.conservatives4palin.com/2010/04/governor-palin-reacts-to-arizona.html |title=Governor Palin Reacts to Arizona Immigration Law |publisher=Conservatives4Palin.com |date=2010-04-27 |accessdate=2010-05-28}}</ref> Palin has since endorsed [[Arizona]] [[List of Governors of Arizona|Governor]] [[Jan Brewer]]'s "Secure The Border – Support Arizona" campaign. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.securetheborder.org/ |title=Support Arizona |publisher=Secure The Border |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28}}</ref> . 

On the July 9, 2010 episode of ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', Palin again indicated support for a path to citizenship but clarified that illegal aliens should not be "rewarded for bad behavior": "We won’t complicate it any more. Let’s keep it simple, and let’s say, ‘No, if you are here illegally and you don’t follow the steps that at some point through immigration reform we’re going to be able to provide, and that is to somehow allow you to work. If you’re not going to do that, then you will be deported. You will be gone." Palin emphasized that more border enforcement should come first and said that current attempts at reform should "learn from history", with reference to the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986|amnesty]] granted by [[Ronald Reagan]], which she believed was "botched". <ref>[http://www.mediaite.com/tv/sarah-palin-americans-must-learn-from-reagans-mistakes-on-illegal-immigration/ Sarah Palin | Illegal Immigrants | Bill O'Reilly].

I'd like to see that continue, but unfortunately, the Dream Act kind of usurps that, the system, that is a legal system, to make sure that immigrants who want to be here legally, working hard, producing and supplying revenue and resources for their family, that they're able to do that right and legally.

Since health care would have to be rationed if it were promised to everyone, it would therefore lead to harm for many individuals not able to receive the government care. That leads, of course, to death." Palin also clarified that, "The term I used to describe the panel making these decisions should not be taken literally."<ref name="Lowry"/>

So, yeah, with some practical things that have to be made, some decisions here, with perhaps changing, in future years, not adversely affecting those who are reliant on retirement benefits today, for instance, [[Retirement Insurance Benefits|Social Security benefits]], but changing, perhaps, the eligibility in future years.

She continued, "We've got to allow the free market to dictate what's most efficient and economical for our nation's economy. No, at this time, our country can't afford the subsidies.

===Don't Ask, Don't Tell===. 
During an interview on February 7, 2010, ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'' host [[Chris Wallace (journalist)|Chris Wallace]] asked Palin if she supported repeal of [[Don't ask, don't tell|"don't ask, don't tell"]], the United States military policy which restricts efforts to discover or reveal closeted gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members or applicants, while barring those who are openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual from military service. Palin responded, "I don't think so right now. I was surprised that the President spent time on that in his [[2010 State of the Union Address|State of the Union speech]] when he only spent about 9 percent of his time in the State of the Union on national security issues.

Palin has said that the former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] states of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Ukraine]] should be admitted into [[NATO]], and that if [[Russia]] invaded a NATO signatory country, the United States should be prepared to go to war in that country's defense. <ref name=USNWR/><ref>[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/latestnews/Palin-39prepared-for-war-with.4488838.jp Palin 'prepared for war with Russia on Georgia'], The Scotsman, September 13, 2008</ref> Going to war in defense of NATO allies who are invaded is current US policy. <ref>[http://www.bostonherald.com/news/2008/view.bg?articleid=1118506&srvc=rss Palin leaves open the option of war with Russia], BostonHerald.com, September 11, 2008</ref> . 

Palin opposes [[New START]], a bilateral [[Nuclear disarmament|nuclear arms reduction]] [[treaty]] between the United States and the Russian Federation. She argued that the treaty is "one-sided" because it "actually requires the U.S. to reduce our nuclear weapons and allows the Russians to increase theirs." Palin further stated that the treaty's link between offensive and defensive weapons "virtually guarantees that either we limit our missile defenses or the Russians will withdraw from the treaty."<ref>[http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=474208438434 Niet compatibele browser].

===Foreign aid===. 
Palin criticized President Obama for committing $2 billion to [[Egypt]]'s new government as part of a $20 billion aid package pledged at the [[37th G8 summit]] to [[Arab Spring]] states. <ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/27/g8-summit-pledge-arab-spring G8 summit to pledge £12bn for Arab spring states | World news | guardian.co.uk]. Guardian. Retrieved on 2011-06-04. </ref> She noted Egypt's "history of corruption when it comes to utilizing American aid" and the possibility of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] taking the reins of Egypt's government. "Throwing borrowed money around is not sound economic policy. And throwing borrowed money around the developing world is not sound foreign policy," Palin said. "Foreign assistance should go to American allies that need it and appreciate it, and for humanitarian purposes when it can truly make a difference."<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150193243058435 Niet compatibele browser].
