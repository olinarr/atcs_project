{{U.S. Deficit and Debt Topics}} . 

Many of the debates surrounding the [[United States federal budget]] center around competing [[macroeconomic]] schools of thought. In general, Democrats favor the principles of [[Keynesian economics]] to encourage economic growth via a [[mixed economy]] of both private and public enterprise, a [[welfare state]], and strong regulatory oversight. Conversely, Republicans generally support applying the principles of either ''[[laissez-faire]]'' or [[supply-side economics]] to grow the economy via small government, low taxes, limited regulation, and [[free enterprise]]. <ref>{{cite web | url=ttp://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/07/20/presidents-and-their-debts-fdr-to-bush/presidential-pleasure-principles | title=Presidents and Their Debts, F.D.R. to Bush | first=Alonzo | last=Hamby | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=2011-07-29 | accessdate=2011-08-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/node/18560739 | title=The rise of the anti-Keynesians | publisher=[[The Economist]] | date=2011-04-14 | accessdate=2011-08-16}}</ref> Debates have surrounded the appropriate size and role of the federal government since the founding of the country.  These debates also deal with questions of morality, [[income equality]] and [[intergenerational equity]]. For example, Congress adding to the debt today may or may not enhance the quality of life for future generations, who must also bear the additional interest and taxation burden. <ref>[http://www.pgpf.org/Special-Topics/Download-the-Citizens-Guide.aspx Peter G.

==Cause of decline in U.S. financial position==. 
[[File:CBO Forecast Changes for 2009-2012.png|thumb|350px|Causes for Changes in CBO Forecasts]] . 

Both economic conditions and policy decisions significantly worsened the debt outlook since 2001, when large surpluses were forecast for the following decade by the CBO. The Pew Center reported in April 2011 the cause of a $12.7 trillion shift in the debt situation, from a 2001 CBO forecast of $2.3 trillion cumulative surplus by 2011 versus the estimated $10.4 trillion public debt in 2011. The major drivers were:
*Revenue declines due to two recessions, separate from the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003: 28%
*Defense spending increases: 15%
*The [[Bush Tax cuts]] (EGTRRA-2001 and JGTRRA-2003): 13%
*Increases in net interest: 11%
*Other non-defense spending: 10%
*Other tax cuts: 8%
*Obama Stimulus: 6%
*Medicare Part D: 2%
*Other reasons: 7%<ref>[http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/Fiscal_Analysis/Essential_Federal_Fiscal_Charts.pdf Pew Center-10 Essential Fiscal Charts-Retrieved November 2011]</ref><ref>[http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Fact_Sheets/Economic_Policy/drivers_federal_debt_since_2001.pdf Pew Center-The Great Debt Shift-April 2011]</ref> .

The answer is, three main things. First, there were the Bush tax cuts, which added roughly $2 trillion to the national debt over the last decade. Second, there were the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which added an additional $1.1 trillion or so. And third was the Great Recession, which led both to a collapse in revenue and to a sharp rise in spending on unemployment insurance and other safety-net programs."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/09/opinion/09krugman.html?src=ISMR_AP_LO_MST_FB NYT-Paul Krugman-The Unwisdom of Elites-May 2011]</ref> A ''Bloomberg'' analysis in May 2011 attributed $2.0 trillion of the $9.3 trillion of public debt (20%) to additional military and intelligence spending since September 2001, plus another $45 billion annually in interest. <ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-12/bin-laden-s-death-won-t-end-toll-on-taxpayers.html Bloomberg-Bin Laden Exacts Multitrillion-Dollar Toll on U.S. Taxpayer-May 2011]</ref> . 

The extent to which the deficit and debt increases are a cause or effect of wider systemic problems is frequently debated. For example, in January 2008, then [[Comptroller General of the United States|GAO Director]] [[David M. Walker (U.S. Comptroller General)|David Walker]] pointed to four types of "deficits" that cause the overall fiscal problem: budget, [[trade deficit|trade]], savings and leadership. <ref name="gao.gov">[http://www.gao.gov/cghome/d08446cg.pdf GAO-U.S. Financial Condition and Fiscal Future Briefing-David Walker-January 2008]</ref> [[Bill Gross]] wrote in August 2011 that aging demographics, globalization, and technological innovation are key drivers of a long-term lack of sustainable global demand: "Debt has been simply an abused sovereign and private market antidote to sustain [demand]. We and our global market competitors are and have been experiencing a lack of aggregate demand for several decades. It is now only visibly coming to a head, as the magic elixir of leverage is drained and exhausted."<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/americas-debt-is-not-its-biggest-problem/2011/08/10/gIQAgYvE7I_story.html Washington Post-Bill Gross-America’s debt is not its biggest problem-August 2011]</ref> Economist [[Carmen Reinhart]] wrote that the world is recovering from a global financial crisis, which is different from a typical recession caused by the business cycle. Historically, after financial crises, unemployment is considerably higher and GDP growth significantly lower than pre-crisis levels, for 7–10 years. <ref name="washingtonpost.com">[http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/double-dip-or-just-one-big-economic-dive/2011/08/05/gIQANKAIxI_story.html?hpid=z1 Washington Post-Ezra Klein-Double Dip, or Just One Big Economic Dive?-August 2011]</ref>  . 

Economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] wrote in October 2011 that the recession and high unemployment of the 2009-2011 period was years in the making and driven by: unsustainable consumption; high manufacturing productivity outpacing demand thereby increasing unemployment; income inequality that shifted income from those who tended to spend it (i.e., the middle class) to those who do not (i.e., the wealthy); and emerging market's buildup of currency reserves (to the tune of $7.6 trillion by 2011) which was not spent. These factors all lead to a "massive" shortfall in aggregate demand, which was "papered over" by demand related to the housing bubble until it burst. <ref>[http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/stiglitz143/English Joseph Stiglitz-Project Syndicate-October 2011]</ref> . 

There is debate regarding whether the policies of President George W. Bush or President Barack Obama added more to deficits and debt. While deficits increased significantly in fiscal year 2008 and thereafter, much of it was due to economic conditions (which reduced revenue while increasing spending on safety net programs such as unemployment compensation) rather than specific policies enacted by President Obama. One study summarized in the ''New York Times'' estimated that President Bush's policies added $5.07 trillion to the debt between 2002-2009, while President Obama's policies would add an estimated $1.44 trillion to the debt between 2009-2017. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/opinion/sunday/24sun4.html?_r=2&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss NYT-How the Deficit Got this Big-Teresa Tritch-July 2011]</ref> . 

==Economic debates==. 
CBO estimated in October 2011 that approximately one-third of the deficit projected for fiscal year 2012 is due to economic factors, which have caused expenditures to increase and revenues to decline: "...if the economy was operating at its potential level...the projected federal deficit under current law in fiscal year 2012 would be about a third lower, or roughly $630 billion instead of the $973 billion projected in CBO’s most recent baseline. That deficit would be equal to about 4.0 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), compared with the 6.2 percent deficit projected for 2012 in CBO’s baseline."<ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/124xx/doc12440/10-04-Portion_of_Deficit_Due_to_Cyclical_Weakness.pdf CBO Letter to Congressman Van Hollen-October 4, 2011]</ref> . 

===Unemployment===. 
[[File:US Unemployment measures.svg|thumb|U.S. unemployment under various definitions]]
CBO reported in 2009 that income tax revenues had declined by nearly 20% due to higher [[unemployment]] caused by the recession, while social safety net expenditures increased significantly. <ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/106xx/doc10640/10-2009-MBR.pdf CBO-Monthly Budget Review-October 2009]</ref> The [[Economic Policy Institute]] (EPI) estimated in May 2010 that 15 million Americans were unemployed and another 11 million were involuntarily working part time or had dropped out of the labor force. <ref>[http://www.epi.org/analysis_and_opinion/entry/the_real_deficit_crisis_jobs/ EPI-The Real Deficit Crisis: Jobs-May 2010]</ref> The U.S. labor force participation rate has declined from over 66% in 2007 to 64.2% in April 2011, while the ratio of civilians employed relative to the population has declined from over 63% in 2007 to 58.4%. <ref name="wellsfargo.com">[https://www.wellsfargo.com/downloads/pdf/com/research/special_reports/CyclicalvsStructuralDebate_05182011.pdf Wells Fargo Economics-Cyclical vs. Structural Unemployment-May 2011]</ref> Unemployment is highly [[correlation|correlated]] with education levels. In April 2011, the unemployment rate was 4.5% for those with a college degree, 9.7% for high school graduates, and 14.6% for those without a high school diploma. <ref name="ReferenceA">[https://www.wellsfargo.com/downloads/pdf/com/research/special_reports/Three_Hard_Realities_05272011.pdf Wells Fargo Economics-Three Hard Realities of an Economy Out of Balance-May 2011]</ref> The U.S. economy added 9.2 million net jobs during the 2000-2007 period but only 2.2 million jobs from 2000–2010, with the banking crisis and recession eliminating an estimated 7 million jobs. By contrast, the U.S. economy added 18.1 million jobs from 1990–2000 and 19.5 million jobs from 1980-1990. <ref name="economix.blogs.nytimes.com">[http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/29/jobs-deficit-investment-deficit-fiscal-deficit/ NYT-Tyson-Jobs Deficit, Investment Deficit, Fiscal Deficit-July 2011]</ref> . 

====Unemployment and economic growth====. 
[[Niall Ferguson]] estimated that excluding the effects of home equity withdrawal made possible by a [[2007-2011 United States housing bubble|U.S. housing bubble]], the U.S. economy grew only 1% annually from 2001-2008. <ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/article973785.ece Globe and Mail-Niall Ferguson Interview-There Will Be Blood-February 2009]</ref> The U.S. economy has historically required 2-4% annual growth ([[Okun's Law]]) to employ new workers entering the workforce, to prevent the unemployment rate from rising. <ref name="Baumohl 2008">{{cite book
| last = Baumohl
| first = Bernard
| year = 2008
| title = The Secrets of Economic Indicators | publisher = Wharton School Publishing
| isbn = 0-13-244729-0}}</ref> This implies that unemployment would have been growing since 2001 in the absence of the housing bubble, instead of suddenly rising in its wake. Economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] wrote in October 2011: "...the economy was very sick before the [[subprime mortgage crisis|crisis]]; the housing bubble merely papered over its weaknesses. Without bubble-supported consumption, there would have been a massive shortfall in aggregate demand. Instead, the personal saving rate plunged to 1%, and the bottom 80% of Americans were spending, every year, roughly 110% of their income."<ref>[http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/stiglitz143/English Joseph Stiglitz-"To Cure the Economy" - Project Syndicate-October 2011]</ref> . 

Former Treasury Secretary [[Lawrence Summers]] stated in July 2011: "Look, the most important determinant of where the deficit is going to be three, four years from now is how fast the economy grows. If the economy stagnates, no matter what we do with deficit deals, that deficit's going to be in a terrible place, and that's why growing the economy is so important."<ref name="transcripts.cnn.com">[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1107/17/fzgps.01.html CNN's Fareed Zakaria GPS-Larry Summers Interview Transcript-July 17, 2011]</ref> CBO estimated in January 2011 that reducing its GDP growth estimates by 0.1% annually for a decade would increase the cumulative deficits from 2012-2021 by about $300 billion; CBO estimated GDP growth between 2.7% and 3.8% during that period. <ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12039/01-26_FY2011Outlook.pdf CBO-The Budget and Economic Outlook Fiscal Years 2011-2021 January 2011-Page 116]</ref> . 

[[Fareed Zakaria]] described the factors slowing growth in developed countries like the U.S., writing in November 2011: "The fact is that Western economies - with high wages, generous middle-class subsidies and complex regulations and taxes - have become sclerotic. Now they face pressures from three fronts: demography (an aging population), technology (which has allowed companies to do much more with fewer people) and globalization (which has allowed manufacturing and services to locate across the world)."<ref>[http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2011/11/10/europes-real-problem-lack-of-growth/ CNN Fareed Zakaria GPS-November 10,2011]</ref> . 

====Unemployment - Is it cyclical or structural?====. 
There is significant debate among economists regarding the extent to which unemployment is cyclical (i.e., temporary and responsive to stimulus measures that spur demand) or structural (i.e., longer-term and requiring process reforms and re-allocation of workers among industries and geographies). Wells Fargo Economics estimated in May 2011 that the [[Nairu|structural unemployment rate]] ranges between 6.3% to 7.1% and has risen due to the crisis. CBO estimates the rate around 5%. Factors affecting the structural rate of unemployment included: Education levels; rising costs of employee healthcare benefits; extension of unemployment benefits; reduced workforce mobility (i.e., ability to relocate to available jobs is reduced due to home price declines); and a skills mismatch (i.e., the skills of the unemployed do not match with open jobs). <ref name="wellsfargo.com"/> [[Mohamed El-Erian]] wrote in May 2011: "Unemployment must be seen as much more than a cyclical problem; it's a structural one that requires concurrent progress on job retraining, housing reform, education, social safety nets and private-sector competitiveness...America's political parties must jointly agree [to make] progress on the structural-reform agenda..."<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,2069445,00.html Time El-Erian Time to Fix the Economy-April 2011]</ref><ref>[http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/elerian4/English Project Syndicate El-Erian Sleepwalking Through America's Unemployment Crisis-April 2011]</ref> . 

The [[Congressional Research Service]] summarized a variety of studies that indicated changes in unemployment between 2007 and 2010 were 65-80% cyclical, thus mainly due to reduced aggregate demand for goods and services. Labor mobility was not a key issue due to the widespread nature of job losses across geographies and industries. Cyclically sensitive industries such as manufacturing and construction had the most significant job losses. One study referenced in the CRS research indicated that long-term unemployment can convert cyclical to structural unemployment through loss of skills. <ref>[http://www.workforceatm.org/sections/pdf/2011/TheIncreaseinUnemploymentSince2007IsItCyclicalorStructural.pdf?CFID=2391211&CFTOKEN=58162036 Congressional Research Service-The Increase in Unemployment Since 2007: Is it Structural or Cyclical?-April 2011]</ref> . 

====Unemployment outlook====. 
CBO forecasts that unemployment will be 8.9% during 2011 and 8.5% during 2012, falling to 5.3 by 2016. <ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/123xx/doc12316/Update_SummaryforWeb.pdf CBO-The Budget and Economic Outlook-August 2011]</ref> However, the McKinsey Global Institute reported in June 2011 that the U.S. economy was unlikely to return to a 5% unemployment rate prior to 2020. Further, the lag between GDP and employment returning to their pre-recession peaks has grown with recent recessions. This averaged around 6 months for 7 recessions between 1948-1981 but rose to 15 months in 1990 and 39 months in 2001. To return to pre-recession employment levels by 2020, the U.S. economy would have to create 21 million net new jobs. This is roughly 187,000 jobs per month, versus 117,000 created on average during each of the first three months of 2011. <ref name="mckinsey.com">[http://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/publications/us_jobs/pdfs/MGI_us_jobs_exec_summary.pdf McKinsey-An Economy that Works-June 2011]</ref> . 

High consumer debt levels inhibit demand for goods and services, which affects employment. USA household debt as a percentage of annual [[disposable personal income]] was 127% at the end of 2007, versus 77% in 1990. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12637090 |title=The End of the Affair |publisher=Economist |date=2008-10-30 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref> Economist [[Carmen Reinhart]] stated in August 2011: "Debt de-leveraging [reduction] takes about seven years...And in the decade following severe financial crises, you tend to grow by 1 to 1.5 percentage points less than in the decade before, because the decade before was fueled by a boom in private borrowing, and not all of that growth was real. The unemployment figures in advanced economies after falls are also very dark. Unemployment remains anchored about five percentage points above what it was in the decade before.”<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/double-dip-or-just-one-big-economic-dive/2011/08/05/gIQANKAIxI_story.html?hpid=z1 Washington Post-Ezra Klein-A Double Dip or One Big Dive?-August 5, 2012]</ref> . 

===Trade deficit and globalization===. 
{{See also|Balance of trade}} . 

[[File:U.S. Trade Deficit 2011.png|thumb|300px|right|U.S. Current Account or Trade Deficit]]
[[Globalization]] refers to the integration of national economies, driven by factors such as technological advancement, business and financial innovation, and labor rate differentials. Imported goods are made by workers in other countries, which affects U.S. employment and wage levels. The U.S. has a large [[current account]] or trade deficit, meaning its imports exceed exports. In 2005, [[Ben Bernanke]] addressed the implications of the USA's high and rising current account deficit, which increased by $650 billion between 1996 and 2004, from 1.5% to 5.8% of GDP. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050414/default.htm |title=Bernanke-The Global Saving Glut and U.S. Current Account Deficit |publisher=Federalreserve.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/02/opinion/02krugman.html Paul Krugman-NYT-The Revenge of the Glut-March 2009]</ref> The trade deficit reached a dollar peak of approximately $700 billion in 2008 (4.9% of GDP) before dropping to $420 billion in 2009 (2.9% of GDP) due to the 2009 recession. <ref>[http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/international/transactions/2010/pdf/trans_annual09_fax.pdf BEA-U.S. Current Account Deficit Decreases in 2009-March 2010]</ref> The trade deficit was $500 billion in 2010, with a goods deficit of $650 billion offset by a services surplus of $150 billion. <ref>[http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/international/trade/2011/pdf/trad0411.pdf BEA-U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services April 2011-Exhibit 1]</ref> . 

====The global workforce====. 
Due in part to the end of the [[Cold War]] and in part to new communications technologies that fostered an integrated global supply chain, nearly three billion working-age persons from China, India, the former Socialist economies in Eastern Europe, and other emerging markets have steadily been joining the global free market labor force since 1990. According to an October 2011 report by the [[New America Foundation]], "The integration of these high-savings, lower wage economies into the global economy...decisively shifted the balance of global supply and demand. In consequence, the world economy now is beset by excess supplies of labor, capital, and productive capacity relative to global demand."<ref>[http://newamerica.net/publications/policy/the_way_forward New America Foundation-The Way Forward-October 2011]</ref> . 

This global workforce competes for both manufacturing and service jobs. An estimated 84% of Americans in the labor force are employed in service jobs, up from 81% in 2000. Princeton economist [[Alan Blinder]] said in 2007 that the number of jobs at risk of being shipped out of the country could reach 40 million over the next 10 to 20 years, which represents one out of every three service sector jobs. <ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2007-04-20-4155011268_x.htm USA Today-Factory Jobs: 3 Million Lost Since 2000-April 2007]</ref> For example, entry level call center workers in the U.S. earn about $20,000 per year, about six times as much as similar jobs in India. An estimated 750,000 call center jobs were off-shored by U.S. firms to India and the Philippines as of November 2011. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/business/philippines-overtakes-india-as-hub-of-call-centers.html NYT-A New Capital of Call Centers-November 2011]</ref> Since the early 1980s, the globalization of production and the growth of markets abroad have driven many firms to locate production closer to their customers. Moreover, the push for competitiveness and productivity has meant more automation (i.e., capital instead of labor) to improve the efficiency of production. <ref name="ReferenceA"/>  . 

====Impact on manufacturing jobs====. 
China's share of global manufacturing increased from approximately 5% in 1996 to 12% in 2008. China represents roughly one-third of the U.S. trade deficit, nearly $250 billion in 2008. <ref name="Zandi 2009">{{cite book

| title = Financial Shock | publisher = FT Press
| isbn = 978-0-13-701663-1}}</ref> The [[Economic Policy Institute]] estimated U.S. job losses due to the trade deficit with China alone at 2.3 million jobs between 2001 and 2007, along with significantly lowered U.S. wages. <ref>[http://www.epi.org/publications/entry/bp219/ EPI-The China Trade Toll-July 2008]</ref>  [[USA Today]] reported in 2007 that an estimated one in six factory jobs (3.2 million) have disappeared from the U.S. since 2000, due to automation or [[off-shoring]] to countries like Mexico and China, where labor is cheaper. ''[[The Economist]]'' reported in March 2011 that U.S. manufacturing employment declined steadily from approximately 17 million in 2000 to under 12 million in 2010. <ref>[http://www.economist.com/node/18332894 The Economist-Rustbelt Recovery-March 2011]</ref> . 

====Innovation and job creation====. 
A popular product, the Apple [[iPod]], offers an interesting perspective on globalization and employment. This product was developed by a U.S. corporation. In 2006, it was produced by about 14,000 workers in the U.S. and 27,000 overseas.  Further, the salaries attributed to this product were overwhelmingly distributed to highly skilled U.S. professionals, as opposed to lower skilled U.S. retail employees or overseas manufacturing labor. Increasingly, globalization is shifting incomes to those with the highest educational backgrounds and professional skills. One interpretation of this result is that U.S. innovation can create more jobs overseas than domestically. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html?_r=1 NYT-Apple and a Squeezed Middle Class-Jan 2012]</ref><ref>[http://blogs.reuters.com/chrystia-freeland/2011/07/01/winners-and-losers-in-the-apple-economy/ Reuters-Freeland-Winners and Losers in the Apple Economy-July 2011]</ref> During 2011, Apple employed 43,000 U.S. workers and 20,000 overseas.  However, nearly 700,000 workers overseas made nearly all of its iPhone, iPad and other products. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html?scp=1&sq=the%20apple%20economy&st=cse NYT-How the U.S. Lost Out on I-Phone Work-January 21, 2012]</ref> . 

[[Andrew Grove]] wrote in July 2010 that key technology innovations are increasingly "scaled" or mass-produced in Asia, with a 10-1 ratio of overseas to domestic workers. He wrote that Asian countries "seem to understand that job creation must be the No. 1 objective of economic policy." He recommended a tax on products made off-shore, to be used to fund companies that will scale their U.S. operations. <ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_28/b4186048358596.htm Andy Grove-How America Can Create Jobs]</ref> . 

====Commentary====. 
Economist [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in 2007: "For the world economy as a whole — and especially for poorer nations — growing trade between high-wage and low-wage countries is a very good thing...But for American workers the story is much less positive. In fact, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that growing U.S. trade with third world countries reduces the real wages of many and perhaps most workers in this country...The trouble now is that these effects may no longer be as modest as they were, because imports of manufactured goods from the third world have grown dramatically — from just 2.5 percent of GDP in 1990 to 6 percent in 2006."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/28/opinion/28krugman.html?adxnnl=1&ref=paulkrugman&adxnnlx=1308531928-wVflA/Uha3Xs6Q4tKAydDw NYT-Krugman-Trouble with Trade-December 2007]</ref> [[Bill Gross]] wrote in September 2011: "Globalization has hollowed developed economy labor markets...Globalization and technological innovation have been extremely negative influences on domestic wages and employment."<ref>[http://www.pimco.com/EN/Insights/Pages/SixPackin.aspx Bill Gross-Six Pac(k)in'-September 2011]</ref> Economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] said in February 2012: "The economic theory is very clear...What happens when you bring together countries which are very different like the United States and China...is that the wages in the high-wage country get depressed down. This was predictable. Full globalization would in fact mean the wages in the United States would be the same as the wages in China. That’s what you mean by a perfect market."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/03/us/03iht-letter03.html?_r=2&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss NYT-Reuters-Chrystia Freeland-As Jobs Go Global, U.S. Workers Pay-February 2012]</ref> . 

Former Fed chair [[Paul Volcker]] argued in February 2010 that the U.S. should make more of the goods it consumes domestically: "We need to do more manufacturing again. We're never going to be the major world manufacturer as we were some years ago, but we could do more than we're doing and be more competitive. And we've got to close that big gap.

====Currency valuation and trade policy====. 
Policies that affect the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies also affect employment levels. Economist [[Christina Romer]] wrote in May 2011: "A weaker dollar means that our goods are cheaper relative to foreign goods. That stimulates our exports and reduces our imports. Higher net exports raise domestic production and employment. Foreign goods are more expensive, but more Americans are working. Given the desperate need for jobs, on net we are almost surely better off with a weaker dollar for a while."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/22/business/economy/22view.html?src=recg NYT-Christina Romer-Needed: Plain Talk About the Dollar-May 2011]</ref> Economist [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in May 2011: "First, what’s driving the turnaround in our manufacturing trade? The main answer is that the U.S. dollar has fallen against other currencies, helping give U.S.-based manufacturing a cost advantage.

===Can the U.S. outgrow the problem?===. 
[[Image:Growth Rates GDP vs. Entitlements.png|thumb|300px|right|GAO Comparative Increase in Spend vs. GDP.]] . 

There is debate regarding whether tax cuts, less intrusive regulation, and productivity improvements could feasibly generate sufficient economic growth to offset the deficit and debt challenges facing the country. According to [[David Stockman]], OMB Director under President Reagan, post-1980 Republican ideology embraces the idea that the "economy will outgrow the deficit if plied with enough tax cuts."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/01/opinion/01stockman.html?pagewanted=all NY Times-David Stockman-Four Defamations of the Apocalypse-August 2010]</ref> Former President George W. Bush exemplified this ideology when he wrote in 2007: "...it is also a fact that our tax cuts have fueled robust economic growth and record revenues."<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/05/AR2007010501801.html Washington Post-A Heckuva Claim-January 2007]</ref> However, as described above, multiple studies by economists across the political spectrum and several government organizations argue that tax cuts increase deficits and debt. <ref name="cbpp.org"/><ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/69xx/doc6908/12-01-10PercentTaxCut.pdf CBO-Analyzing the Economic and Budgetary Effects of a Ten Percent Cut in Income Tax Rates-December 2005]</ref> . 

The GAO estimated in 2008 that double-digit GDP growth would be required for the next 75 years to outgrow the projected increases in deficits and debt; GDP growth averaged 3.2% during the 1990s. Because mandatory spending growth rates will far exceed any reasonable growth rate in GDP and the tax base, the GAO concluded that the U.S. cannot grow its way out of the problem. <ref>[http://www.gao.gov/cghome/d08446cg.pdf GAO U.S. Fiscal Briefing 1/08]</ref> . 

Fed Chair [[Ben Bernanke]] stated in April 2010: "Unfortunately, we cannot grow our way out of this problem. No credible forecast suggests that future rates of growth of the U.S. economy will be sufficient to close these deficits without significant changes to our fiscal policies."<ref name="federalreserve.gov">[http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20100427a.htm Ben Bernanke-Speech before the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform-April 2010]</ref> . 

==Debates about the public debt==. 
===Is there a "danger level" of debt?===. 
Economists debate the level of debt relative to GDP that signals a "red line" or dangerous level, or if any such level exists. In January 2010, Economists [[Kenneth Rogoff]] and [[Carmen Reinhart]] stated that 90% of GDP might be an indicative danger level. <ref>Belsie, Laurent (April 2010). [http://www.nber.org/digest/apr10/w15639.html "Growth in a time of debt"].  NBER Digest OnLine. Retrieved February 9, 2011. </ref>  Reinhart testified to the U.S. Senate in February 2010, stating:<ref>Reinhart, Carmen M. (February 9, 2010).

Retrieved February 9, 2011. </ref>
<blockquote>Our main finding is that across both advanced countries and emerging markets, high debt/GDP levels (90 percent and above) are associated with notably lower growth outcomes. Above 90 percent, median growth rates fall one percent, and average growth falls considerably more. In addition, for emerging markets, there appears to be a more stringent threshold for total external debt/GDP; when external debt reaches 60 percent of GDP, annual growth declines by about two percent and for higher levels, growth rates are roughly cut in half. Seldom do countries simply 'grow' their way out of deep debt burdens. </blockquote>
Economist [[Paul Krugman]] disputes the existence of a solid debt threshold or danger level, arguing that low growth causes high debt rather than the other way around. <ref name="krugman.blogs.nytimes.com">Krugman, Paul (May 27, 2010).

Fed Chair [[Ben Bernanke]] stated in April 2010:<ref>Bernanke, Ben S. (April 27, 2010).

<blockquote>Neither experience nor economic theory clearly indicates the threshold at which government debt begins to endanger prosperity and economic stability. But given the significant costs and risks associated with a rapidly rising federal debt, our nation should soon put in place a credible plan for reducing deficits to sustainable levels over time. </blockquote> . 

===Measure of public debt===. 
Economists also debate the definition of public debt. Krugman argued in May 2010 that the debt held by the public is the right measure to use, while Reinhart has testified to the President's Fiscal Reform Commission that gross debt is the appropriate measure. (Gross debt includes government debt held by government institutions, such as the Federal Reserve and the Social Security trust fund.)  Certain members of the Commission are focusing on gross debt. <ref name="krugman.blogs.nytimes.com"/> The [[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]] (CBPP) cited research by several economists supporting the use of the lower debt held by the public figure as a more accurate measure of the debt burden, disagreeing with these Commission members. <ref name="cbpp.org">Horney, James R. (May 27, 2010). [http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=3197 "Recommendation that president’s fiscal commission focus on gross debt is misguided"]. Center on Budget and Policy Priorities [website]. Retrieved February 9, 2011. </ref> . 

===Intragovernmental debt===. 
There is debate regarding the economic nature of the intragovernmental debt, which was approximately $4.6&nbsp;trillion in February 2011. A significant portion of the intragovernmental debt is the $2.6&nbsp;trillion Social Security Trust Fund. <ref>United States Treasury, Bureau of the Public Debt (April 30, 2010). [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/mspd/2010/opds042010.pdf "Monthly statement of public debt of the United States"]. TreasuryDirect. Retrieved February 9, 2011. </ref> . 

For example, the CBPP argues:<ref name="cbpp.org"/>
<blockquote>Debt held by the public is important because it reflects the extent to which the government goes into private credit markets to borrow. Such borrowing draws on private national saving and international saving, and therefore competes with investment in the nongovernmental sector (for factories and equipment, research and development, housing, and so forth). Large increases in such borrowing can also push up interest rates and increase the amount of future interest payments the federal government must make to lenders outside of the United States, which reduces Americans’ income. By contrast, intragovernmental debt (the other component of the gross debt) has no such effects because it is simply money the federal government owes (and pays interest on) to itself. </blockquote> . 

If the U.S. continues to run "on budget" deficits as projected by the CBO and OMB for the foreseeable future, it will have to issue marketable Treasury bills and bonds (i.e., debt held by the public) to pay for the projected shortfall in the Social Security program. This will result in "debt held by the public" replacing "intragovernmental debt" to the extent of the Social Security Trust Fund during the period the Trust Fund is liquidated, which is expected to occur between 2015 and the mid-2030s. This replacement of intragovernmental debt with debt held by the public would not occur if: a) The U.S. runs on-budget surpluses sufficient to offset "off-budget" deficits in the Social Security program; or b) Social Security is reformed to maintain an off-budget surplus. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/115xx/doc11580/07-01-SSOptions_forWeb.pdf |title=CBO-Social Security Policy Options-July 2010 |format=PDF |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576510660976229354.html#articleTabs%3Darticle%26commentId%3D2977549 WSJ-A Short Primer on the National Debt-John Steele Gordon-August 2011]</ref> . 

==Debates about tax policy==. 
===Budgetary impact of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts===. 
{{Main|Bush tax cuts}}
[[File:Impact of Bush Tax Cut Extension.png|thumb|300px|right|Congressional Research Service-Impact of Extension of the Bush Tax Cuts]]
A variety of tax cuts were enacted under President Bush between 2001–2003 (commonly referred to as the "[[Bush tax cuts]]"), through the [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001]] (EGTRRA) and the [[Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act|Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003]] (JGTRRA). Most of these tax cuts were scheduled to expire December 31, 2010. Since CBO projections are based on current law, the projections discussed above assume these tax cuts will expire, which may prove politically challenging.  . 

In August 2010, CBO estimated that extending the tax cuts for the 2011-2020 time period would add $3.3 trillion to the national debt: $2.65 trillion in foregone tax revenue plus another $0.66 trillion for interest and debt service costs. <ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/117xx/doc11705/08-18-Update.pdf Congressional Budget Office-The Budget and Economic Outlook-August 2010-Table 1.7 on Page 24]</ref> . 

The non-partisan [[Pew Charitable Trusts]] estimated in May 2010 that extending some or all of the Bush tax cuts would have the following impact under these scenarios:
*Making the tax cuts permanent for all taxpayers, regardless of income, would increase the national debt $3.1 trillion over the next 10 years. 
*Limiting the extension to individuals making less than $200,000 and married couples earning less than $250,000 would increase the debt about $2.3 trillion in the next decade. 
*Extending the tax cuts for all taxpayers for only two years would cost $558 billion over the next 10 years. <ref>[http://www.pewtrusts.org/our_work_report_detail.aspx?id=59098 Pew Charitable Trusts-Decision Time: The Fiscal Effects of Extending the 2001 and 2003 Tax Cuts-May 2010]</ref> . 

The non-partisan [[Congressional Research Service]] (CRS) has reported the 10-year revenue loss from extending the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts beyond 2010 at $2.9 trillion, with an additional $606 billion in debt service costs (interest), for a combined total of $3.5 trillion. CRS cited CBO estimates that extending the cuts permanently, including the repeal of the estate tax, would add 2% of GDP to the annual deficit. <ref>[http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/148790.pdf Congressional Research Service-Thomas Hungerford-October 27, 2010]</ref> . 

The [[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]] wrote in 2010: "The 75-year Social Security shortfall is about the same size as the cost, over that period, of extending the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts for the richest 2 percent of Americans (those with incomes above $250,000 a year). Members of Congress cannot simultaneously claim that the tax cuts for people at the top are affordable while the Social Security shortfall constitutes a dire fiscal threat."<ref>[http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=3262 CBPP-What the 2010 Trustees' Report Shows About Social Security-August 2010]</ref> . 

===Can reducing income tax rates increase government revenue?===. 
[[File:Federal individual income tax receipts 2000-2009.png|thumb|300px|right|Tax receipts in dollars and relative to GDP]]
In theory, the government collects no revenue at either zero or 100% tax rates. So there is some intermediate point at which government revenue is maximized. Lowering tax rates from 100% to this hypothetical rate that maximizes revenue would theoretically raise revenue, while continuing to lower tax rates below this rate would lower revenues. This concept underlies the [[Laffer Curve]], an element of [[supply-side economics]].  . 

Since the 1970s, some "supply side" economists have contended that lowering marginal tax rates could stimulate economic growth to such a degree that tax revenues could rise, other factors being held constant.  However, economic models and econometric analysis have found weak support for the [[Supply-side economics|"supply side" theory]]. The [[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]] (CBPP) summarized a variety of studies done by economists across the political spectrum that indicated tax cuts do not pay for themselves and increase deficits. <ref name="cbpp.org">[http://www.cbpp.org/archiveSite/3-3-03tax.pdf CBPP-Will the Tax Cuts Eventually Pay for Themselves?-March 2003]</ref> Studies by the CBO and the U.S. Treasury also indicated that tax cuts do not pay for themselves. <ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/69xx/doc6908/12-01-10PercentTaxCut.pdf CBO Study]</ref><ref>[http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/mankiw/files/dynamicscoring_05-1212.pdf Mankiw Study]</ref><ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/05/AR2007010501801.html Washington Post 2007]</ref><ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/14/AR2006051400806.html Washington Post 2006]</ref> In 2003, 450 economists, including ten Nobel Prize laureate, signed the [[Economists' statement opposing the Bush tax cuts]], sent to President Bush stating that "these tax cuts will worsen the long-term budget outlook... will reduce the capacity of the government to finance Social Security and Medicare benefits as well as investments in schools, health, infrastructure, and basic research...

Income tax revenues generally rose to new peaks in nominal dollar terms each year from 1970 to 2000 as the economy grew, with the exception of 1983, following the recession of 1981-1982. However, after peaking in 2000, income tax revenues did not regain this peak again until 2006. After a plateau in 2007 and 2008, revenues fell markedly in 2009 and 2010 due to a financial crisis and recession. Income tax revenues in 2010 remained below their 2000 peak. Relative to GDP, income tax revenues declined during most of the 1980s (from 9.0% GDP in 1980 to 8.3% GDP in 1989), rose during most of the 1990s (from 8.1% GDP in 1990 to 9.6% GDP in 1999) then declined in the 2000s (from 10.2% GDP in 2000 to 6.5% GDP in 2009). <ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12039/HistoricalTables%5B1%5D.pdf CBO Historical Tables-1970 to 2010]</ref> The extent to which economic activity and tax policy interact to drive these trends is debated by experts. While marginal income tax rates were lowered in the early 1980s, dollar revenue increased throughout the period, although revenue relative to GDP declined. Marginal tax rates were raised during the 1990s, and both revenue dollars and revenue relative to GDP increased. Marginal rates were lowered again in the early 2000s, and both revenue and revenue relative to GDP generally declined.  . 

===Can increasing tax receipts alone address the budget deficit?===. 
[[File:Estimated Funding Gaps in Medicare and Social Security Programs.png|thumb|300px|right|Estimated Funding Gaps in Medicare and Social Security.]] . 

Expert panels across the political spectrum have argued for a combination of revenue increases and expense reductions to reduce the budget deficit and future debt increases. However, the nature and balance of these measures varies considerably. <ref name="PGPF-Solutions Summit-May 2011">[http://pgpf.org/Issues/Fiscal-Outlook/2011/01/20/PGPF-Announces-Grants-to-Six-Institutions-to-Develop-Solutions-to-Americas-Fiscal-Challenges.aspx PGPF-Solutions Summit-May 2011]</ref> Economist [[Bruce Bartlett]] wrote in 2009 that without benefit cuts in Medicare and Social Security, federal taxes would have to increase by 8.1% of GDP now and forever to cover estimated program shortfalls, while avoiding debt increases. <ref name="forbes1">[http://www.forbes.com/2009/05/14/taxes-social-security-opinions-columnists-medicare.html Forbes-Bruce Bartlett-The 81% Tax Increase-May 2009]</ref> The 30-year historical average federal tax receipts are 18.4% of GDP, so this would represent a substantial increase in tax receipts as a share of GDP relative to historical levels in the United States.  However, such an increase would still leave tax revenues relative to GDP substantially lower than other developed nations like France and Germany (see: [[List of countries by tax revenue as percentage of GDP]]).  . 

CBO estimated in August 2011 that if the [[Bush tax cuts]] and other tax cuts enacted or extended during 2009 and 2010 were allowed to expire, the budget deficit would be reduced by 2.0-3.0% GDP each year from 2013-2021. <ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/123xx/doc12316/Update_SummaryforWeb.pdf CBO-The Budget and Economic Outlook-August 2011-Summary Figure 1]</ref> . 

===Do tax hikes "kill jobs"?===. 
There is an ongoing debate regarding the effect of taxation on employment or job creation. Prominent Republican Congressmen have argued that raising taxes would "kill" jobs. <ref>[http://johnboehner.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=180190 Congressman John Boehner Website-Weekly Column-April 2010]</ref><ref>[http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/06/kyl-mcconnell-obama-must-break-silence-on-tax-increases.php TPM Muckracker Website-June 23, 2011]</ref> Different views are expressed depending on the type of taxation under discussion.  . 

====Income taxes====. 
The historical record indicates that marginal income tax rate changes have little impact on job creation or employment. 
*During the 1970s, marginal income tax rates were far higher than subsequent periods and the U.S. created 20.6 million net new jobs. 
*During the 1980s, marginal income tax rates were lowered and the U.S. created 19.5 million net new jobs. 
*During the 1990s, marginal income tax rates rose and the U.S. created 18.1 million net new jobs. 
*From 2000-2010, marginal income tax rates were lowered and the U.S. created only 2.2 million net new jobs, with 9.2 million created 2000-2007. <ref>[http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/29/jobs-deficit-investment-deficit-fiscal-deficit/ NYT-Economix Blog-Laura Tyson-Jobs Deficit, Investment Deficit, Fiscal Deficit July 2011]</ref><ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12039/HistoricalTables[1].pdf CBO Historical Tables-1971 to 2010]</ref><ref>[http://www.mckinsey.com/Insights/MGI/Research/Labor_Markets/An_economy_that_works_for_US_job_creation McKinsey Global Institute-An Economy that Works-June 2011]</ref><ref>[http://www.taxfoundation.org/publications/show/151.html Tax Foundation-Historical Tax Tables-Retrieved December 2011]</ref> . 

The [[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]] (CBPP) wrote in March 2009: "Small business employment rose by an average of 2.3 percent (756,000 jobs) per year during the Clinton years, when tax rates for high-income filers were set at very similar levels to those that would be reinstated under President Obama’s budget. But during the Bush years, when the rates were lower, employment rose by just 1.0 percent (367,000 jobs)."<ref>[http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=2742 CBPP-History Contradicts Claim That President’s Budget Would Harm Small Business Job Creation-March 2009]</ref> CBPP reported in September 2011 that both employment and GDP grew faster in the seven-year period following President Clinton's income tax rate ''increase'' of 1993, than a similar period after the Bush tax ''cuts'' of 2001. <ref>[http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=3591 CBPP-Supercommittee Should Develop Balanced Package-September 2011]</ref> . 

In addition, [[Warren Buffett]] has argued that taxes have little to do with job creation, writing in August 2011: "And to those who argue that higher rates hurt job creation, I would note that a net of nearly 40 million jobs were added between 1980 and 2000. You know what’s happened since then: lower tax rates and far lower job creation."<ref name="Buffett_NYTimes"/> . 

A more specific, frequently debated, proposal supported by prominent Democrats is to significantly increase the taxes of the top 1 percent of income earners to generate additional revenue. According to the [[Tax Foundation]], the so-called "super-rich" accumulated more than 20 percent of the nation's total [[adjusted gross income]] in 2008 and paid 36 percent of the total income tax. <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/250.html | title=Summary of Latest Federal Individual Income Tax Data | publisher=[[Tax Foundation]] | date=2010-10-06 | accessdate=2011-08-16}}</ref> Republican opponents fear that any type of large tax hike, even to the wealthy, would decrease both job creation and investment, slowing the economy even further. <ref name="Kocieniewski_NYTimes">{{cite news | first=David | last=Kocieniewski | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/16/business/buffett-calls-on-congress-to-raise-taxes-on-the-rich.html | title=Looking Closer at Taxes on the Rich | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=2011-18-15 | accessdate=2011-08-16}}</ref> In an op-ed in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in August 2011, Buffett wrote in support of such a proposal, stating that the federal government should "stop coddling the super-rich" to help decrease the deficit. <ref name="Buffett_NYTimes">{{cite news | first=Warren |last=Buffett | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/opinion/stop-coddling-the-super-rich.html | title=Stop Coddling the Super-Rich | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=2011-18-15 | accessdate=2011-08-16}}</ref> In response, conservative commentator [[Pat Buchanan]] challenged Buffett, and any other rich people who wanted higher taxes, to voluntarily donate the money to the IRS instead. <ref name="Kocieniewski_NYTimes"/><ref>{{cite web | title=If Warren Buffett Wants a Bigger Tax Bill, Why Doesn't He Just Send His Money to Washington? | url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/44146626 | publisher=[[CNBC]] | date=2011-18-15 | accessdate=2011-08-16}}</ref> . 

====Corporate taxes====. 
A number of US corporations claim that even the current 35 percent corporate income tax rate causes them to shift several of their operations, including their research and manufacturing facilities, overseas. <ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/08/14/60minutes/main20091720.shtml | title=A look at the world's new corporate tax havens | publisher=[[CBS News]] | date=2011-08-14 | accessdate=2011-08-15 | quote=Economist Martin Sullivan says it's standard operating procedure for companies like Cisco. "U.S. multinationals are shifting their research facilities, shifting their manufacturing facilities, and shifting some regional headquarters into Switzerland and into Ireland. And those are massive numbers of jobs." ... An increasingly popular way, particularly pharmaceutical and hi-tech companies like Google avoid paying the 35 percent is to shift their patents, computer code, pill formulas, even logos from their U.S. bases to their outposts in low-tax countries.}}</ref> . 

For example, [[Steven Ballmer]], [[Microsoft]]'s chief executive officer, stated in 2009 that higher taxes "...makes U.S. jobs more expensive. [Microsoft is] better off taking lots of people and moving them out of the U.S. as opposed to keeping them inside the U.S." Microsoft reported an overall effective tax rate of 26 percent in its 2008 annual report: “Our effective tax rates are less than the statutory tax rate due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates” the report said. U.S. tax rules let companies defer paying corporate rates as high as 35 percent on most types of foreign profits as long as that money remains invested overseas. President Obama says he wants to end such incentives to keep foreign profits tax-deferred so that companies would invest them in the U.S. <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aAKluP7yIwJY | title=Ballmer Says Tax Would Move Microsoft Jobs Offshore | publisher=Bloomberg | date=2009-06-03 |accessdate=2011-08-15}}</ref> . 

In comparing corporate taxes, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] found in 2005 that the top statutory tax rate was the third highest among [[OECD]] countries behind Japan and Germany.

====U.S. taxes relative to foreign countries====.

[[File:U.S.-Tax-Revenues-As-GDP-Percentage-(75-05).JPG|thumb|right|350px|Total tax revenues as a percentage of GDP for the U.S. in comparison to the [[OECD]] and the [[EU 15]].]]
Comparison of [[tax rates around the world]] is difficult and somewhat subjective. Tax laws in most countries are extremely complex, and tax burden falls differently on different groups in each country and sub-national units ([[state (polity)|state]]s, [[counties]] and [[municipalities]]) and the types of services rendered through those taxes are also different.  . 

One way to measure the overall tax burden is by looking at it as a percentage of the overall economy in terms of [[GDP]].  The [[Tax Policy Center]] wrote: "U.S. taxes are low relative to those in other developed countries. In 2006 U.S. taxes at all levels of government claimed 28 percent of GDP, compared with an average of 36 percent of GDP for the 30 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)."<ref>[http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/background/numbers/international.cfm Tax Policy Center Briefing Book-Retrieved 31 December 2009]</ref> Economist [[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]] wrote in 2010: "The U.S. government doesn’t take in much tax revenue -- at least 10 percentage points of GDP less than comparable developed economies -- and it also doesn’t spend much except on the military, Social Security and Medicare."<ref>[http://noir.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=axswEndVYlTY Bloomberg-Simon Johnson-Tax Cutters Setup Tomorrow's Fiscal Crisis-December 2010]</ref> A comparison of taxation on individuals amongst OECD countries shows that the U.S. tax burden is just slightly below the average tax for middle income earners. <ref>[http://comparativetaxation.treasury.gov.au/content/report/html/06_Chapter_4-08.asp International Comparison of Taxes by Australian Treasury]</ref> . 

[[File:2010 National Spending of the USA compared to G20.jpg|left|thumb|Comparison of National Spending Per Citizen for the 20 Largest Economies.]]Deficit spending can distort the true total effective taxation. One way to mitigate this distortion is to evaluate spending levels. This approach shows the level of services a country is willing to accept versus what they are willing to pay. In 2010, the Federal government of the USA spent an average of $11,041 per citizen (per capita). This compares to the 2010 World average spending of $2376 per citizen and an average of $16,110 per citizen for the World's 20 largest economies (in terms of GDP). Of the 20 largest economies, only six spent less per citizen: [[South Korea]] ($4557), [[Brazil]] ($2813), [[Russia]] ($2458), [[China]] ($1010), and [[India]] ($$226). Of the 13 that spent more, [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] top the list with per citizen spending of $40908 and $26760 respectively. <ref>CIA World Factbook, population data from 2010, Spending and GDP data from 2011</ref> . 

In comparing corporate taxes, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] found in 2005 that the top statutory tax rate was the third highest among [[OECD]] countries behind Japan and Germany.  However, the U.S. ranked 27th lowest of 30 OECD countries in its collection of corporate taxes relative to GDP, at 1.8% vs. the average 2.5%. <ref name="ReferenceB">[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/69xx/doc6902/11-28-CorporateTax.pdf Corporate Income Tax Rates: International Comparisons]</ref> [[Bruce Bartlett]] wrote in May 2011: "...one almost never hears that total revenues are at their lowest level in two or three generations as a share of G.D.P. or that corporate tax revenues as a share of G.D.P. are the lowest among all major countries. One hears only that the statutory corporate tax rate in the United States is high compared with other countries, which is true but not necessarily relevant. The economic importance of statutory tax rates is blown far out of proportion by Republicans looking for ways to make taxes look high when they are quite low."<ref>[http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/31/are-taxes-in-the-u-s-high-or-low/#postComment NYT-Bruce Bartlett-Are Taxes in the U.S. High or Low?-May 2011]</ref> . 

==Debates about spending==. 
===Are budget deficits driven by a "spending problem" or a "revenue problem"?===. 
[[File:Federal Spending - Cause of Change 2001 to 2009.png|thumb|300px|right|Causes of Change in Federal Spending as % GDP 2001-2009 from CBO Data]]
[[File:Medicare and Medicaid GDP Chart.png|thumb|300px|right|Medicare and Medicaid cost projections as % GDP]] . 

Prominent Republican Congressmen have suggested that the federal deficits should be remedied solely with spending cuts, arguing that the U.S. has a "spending problem" not a "revenue problem."<ref>[http://johnboehner.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=236233 Press Release-Office of John Boehner]</ref><ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/04/13/earlyshow/main20053445.shtml CBS-Cantor: Spending, Not Revenue, Is the Problem-April 2011]</ref> President Obama has proposed that the [[Bush tax cuts]] should be allowed to expire for the wealthiest taxpayers,<ref name="whitehouse1">[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/13/remarks-president-fiscal-policy President Obama-Remarks by the President on Fiscal Policy-April 13, 2011]</ref> while [[Alan Greenspan]] has proposed that these tax cuts should expire at all income levels. <ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42612533/ns/meet_the_press-transcripts/NBC-Meet the Press-Transcript from April 17, 2011]</ref> It is helpful in analyzing this problem to evaluate near-term and long-term fiscal conditions.  . 

====Near-term====. 
Taking the last balanced "total" budget in 2001 as a standard, spending has risen by 5.6% GDP, from 18.2% GDP in 2001 to 23.8% GDP in 2010, while revenues declined by 4.6% GDP, from 19.5% GDP to 14.9% GDP over the same interval. By this measure, spending has increased about 1% GDP more than revenues have declined. Using the historical (1971–2008) average spending of 20.6% GDP and revenues of 18.2%, the spending increase of 3.2% GDP is smaller than the revenue decline of 3.3% GDP. In other words, the "spending problem" and "revenue problem" are comparable in size. <ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12039/HistoricalTables%5B1%5D.pdf CBO Historical Tables-January 2011]</ref> Recessions typically cause spending to rise on social safety net programs such as unemployment insurance and food stamps, while tax revenues decline due to unemployment and reduced economic activity. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2011/08/20/business/AP-US-Recession-Math.html?_r=2&src=busln NYT-Recession is Culprit in High U.S. Debt-August 20, 2011]</ref> . 

====Long-term====. 
In the long-run, Medicare and Medicaid are projected to increase dramatically relative to GDP, while other categories of spending are expected to remain relatively constant. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] expects Medicare and Medicaid to rise from 5.3% GDP in 2009 to 10.0% in 2035 and 19.0% by 2082. CBO has indicated healthcare spending per beneficiary is the primary long-term fiscal challenge. So in the long-run, spending on these programs is the key issue, far outweighing any revenue consideration. <ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/115xx/doc11579/06-30-LTBO.pdf CBO Long-Term Budget Outlook-June 2010]</ref> Economist [[Paul Krugman]] has made the argument that any serious attempt to tackle long-run deficit problems can be summed up in "seven words: health care, health care, health care, revenue."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/18/opinion/18krugman.html NYT-Krugman-Willie Sutton Wept-Feb 2011]</ref> . 

===Earmarks===. 
GAO defines "earmarking" as "designating any portion of a lump-sum amount for particular purposes by means of legislative language."  Earmarking can also mean "dedicating collections by law for a specific purpose." <ref>http://www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-05-734SP</ref>  In some cases, legislative language may direct federal agencies to spend funds for specific projects.  In other cases, earmarks refer to directions in appropriation committee reports, which are not law.  Various organizations have estimated the total number and amount of earmarks.  An estimated 16,000 earmarks containing nearly $48 billion in spending were inserted into larger, often unrelated bills during 2005. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://blogs.usatoday.com/oped/2006/08/hooked_on_hando.html | work=USA Today | accessdate=May 26, 2010 | first=Thomas S. | last=Kidd}} {{Dead link|date=May 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>  While the number of earmarks has grown in the past decade, the total amount of earmarked funds is approximately 1-2 percent of federal spending. <ref>[http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/hjackson/Earmarks_16.pdf Harvard Briefing Paper]</ref> . 

===Fraud, waste and abuse===. 
The [[Office of Management and Budget]] estimated that the federal government made $98 billion in "improper payments" during FY2009, an increase of 38% vs. the $72 billion the prior year. This increase was due in part to effects of the financial crisis and improved methods of detection. The total included $54 billion for healthcare-related programs, 9.4% of the $573 billion spent on those programs. The government pledged to do more to combat this problem, including better analysis, auditing, and incentives. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/11/18/government.improper.payments/index.html|format=URL|title="White House Reports Billions of Improper Payments in 2009" CNN, November 2009|accessdate=November 18, 2009 | date=November 18, 2009}}</ref><ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/blog/09/11/18/ReducingImproperPayments/ OMB Blog-Improper Payments-November 2009]</ref> During July 2010, President Obama signed into law the [[Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010]], citing approximately $110 billion in unauthorized payments of all types. <ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/07/22/improper-payments-elimination-and-recovery-act-cutting-waste-and-fraud-government Whitehouse-Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act]</ref> . 

Former [[Comptroller General of the United States|GAO Director]] [[David M. Walker (U.S. Comptroller General)|David Walker]] said in 2008: "Some people think that we can solve our financial problems by stopping fraud, waste and abuse or by canceling the Bush tax cuts or by ending the war in Iraq. The truth is, we could do all three of these things and we would not come close to solving our nation's fiscal challenges."<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_TjBNjc9Bo I.O.U.S.A. Movie Byte Sized-You Tube Excerpt - Quote About 26 Minutes In]</ref> . 

===Stimulus packages===. 
{{See also|Fiscal policy}}
[[File:CBO GDP impact of ARRA 2009.png|thumb|300px|right|CBO estimates of the impact of the stimulus on GDP]]
Fiscal stimulus can be characterized as investment, spending or tax cuts. For example, if the funds are used to create a physical asset that generates future cash flows (e.g., a power plant or toll road), the stimulus could be characterized as investment. Extending unemployment benefits are examples of government spending. Tax cuts may or may not be spent. There is significant debate among economists regarding which type of stimulus has the highest "multiplier" (i.e., increase in economic activity per dollar of stimulus). <ref>[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/9899 Charlie Rose-Interview with Economists Stiglitz and Feldstein-January 2009]</ref> Fiscal stimulus is enacted by laws passed by Congress, which is distinct from [[monetary policy]] conducted by central banks such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, which involves interest rates and the money supply.  . 

Recent specific stimulus laws included the [[Economic Stimulus Act of 2008]] and the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] (ARRA).  The former was primarily tax cuts, while the latter included a blend of tax cuts, investment and spending.  The CBO initially estimated that ARRA would increase the federal budget deficit by $185 billion during 2009, by $399 billion in 2010, by $134 billion in 2011, for a total of $787 billion over the 2009-2019 period. <ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/99xx/doc9989/hr1conference.pdf CBO-Budgetary Impact of ARRA]</ref> The total was later revised to $825 billion. <ref name="cbo.gov">[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/123xx/doc12385/08-24-ARRA.pdf CBO-Estimated Impact of ARRA-August 2011]</ref> . 

There is significant debate on whether fiscal stimulus is actually effective in creating jobs and boosting the economy, with critics claiming that all it does is increase the deficit unnecessarily. <ref>{{cite news | title=Biden Fires Back At Stimulus Critics | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/16/AR2009071604155.html | publisher=[[Washington Post]] | date=2009-07-17 | accessdate=2011-08-15 | first1=Michael D. | last1=Shear | first2=Alexi | last2=Mostrous}}</ref>  CBO estimated in August 2011 that ARRA had significant positive effects on GDP and employment.  For example, during 2010 the incremental effect on GDP ranged between 1.1 and 4.6 percentage points, the unemployment rate was lowered between 0.7 and 2.0 percentage points, additional employed persons ranged from 1.3 million to 3.6 million, and the number of full time equivalent jobs added ranged from 1.8 million to 5.2 million. Even after the Act spending stops in 2011, CBO estimated it will increase the number of people employed in 2012 by between 0.4 million and 1.1 million. <ref name="cbo.gov"/> . 

Beyond discrete stimulus packages, federal spending tends to increase during recessions due to "automatic stabilizers" such as unemployment compensation and nutrition programs. For example, during May 2010 CBO estimated that "automatic stabilizers added the equivalent of 1.9% of potential GDP to the [2009] deficit, an amount substantially greater than the 0.3% added in 2008. According to CBO’s baseline projections, the contribution of automatic stabilizers to the budget deficit will be roughly 2.3% of potential GDP in 2010 and 2.5% of potential GDP in 2011."<ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/114xx/doc11471/05-27-AutomaticStabilizers.pdf CBO-The Effect of Automatic Stabilizers on the Federal Budget-May 2010]</ref> . 

==Other debate topics==. 
===2010 Budget Proposal===. 
[[File:2010 Budget - Deficit and Debt Increases.png|thumb|300px|right|2010 Budget: Projected Deficits and Debt Increases]]
President [[Barack Obama]] proposed his 2010 budget during February, 2009. He has indicated that health care, clean energy, education, and infrastructure will be priorities. The proposed increases in the national debt exceed $900 billion each year from 2010–2019, following the Bush administration's outgoing budget which allowed for a $1.4 trillion increase in the national debt for FY 2009. <ref>[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BUDGET-2011-BUD/pdf/BUDGET-2011-BUD-28.pdf Federal Budget Summary Tables]</ref> . 

Tax cuts will expire for the wealthiest taxpayers to increase revenues, returning marginal rates to the Clinton levels. Further, the base Department of Defense budget increases slightly through 2014 (Table S-7), from $534 to $575 billion, although supplemental appropriations for the Iraq War are expected to be reduced. In addition, estimates of revenue are based on GDP growth assumptions that exceed the Blue Chip Economists' consensus forecast considerably through 2012 (Table S-8). <ref>[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy10/pdf/fy10-newera.pdf 2010 Budget]</ref><ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/28/AR2009022801960.html?hpid=topnews Washington Post-Montgomery-Battle Lines Quickly Set Over Planned Policy Shifts]</ref> . 

===2010 healthcare reform===. 
{{Main|Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act}}
The CBO estimated in December 2009 that the Senate healthcare reform bill, later signed into law on 23 March 2010, would reduce the deficit during the 2010-2019 period by a total of $132 billion. This figure comprises $615 billion in incremental costs, offset by cost reductions of $483 billion and additional taxes of $264 billion.  The CBO also estimated that the deficit would be about 0.5% lower each year in the 2020-2029 decade, or about $70 billion annually in 2010 dollars. <ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/108xx/doc10868/12-19-Reid_Letter_Managers_Correction_Noted.pdf CBO Letter to Senator Harry Reid-December 19, 2009 See Table 1 and Page 16]</ref> Whether the deficit reduction will materialize is questioned by many budget experts. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/opinion/21holtz-eakin.html NYT-Holtz-Eakin Op Ed-The Real Arithmetic of Healthcare Reform-March 2010]</ref> . 

===State finances===. 
{{See also|Pensions crisis}} . 

The U.S. federal government may be required to assist state governments further, as many U.S. states are facing budget shortfalls due to the 2008-2010 recession. The sharp decline in home prices has affected property tax revenue, while the decline in economic activity and consumer spending has led to a falloff in revenues from state sales taxes and income taxes. The [[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]] estimated that the 2010 and 2011 state shortfalls will total $375 billion. <ref>[http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=711 CBPP-Recession Continues to Batter State Budgets-February 2010]</ref> As of July 2010, over 30 states had raised taxes, while 45 had reduced services. <ref>[http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&id=711 CBPP-Recession Continues to Batter State Budgets-July 2010]</ref> State and local governments cut 405,000 jobs between January 2009 and February 2011. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/23/business/economy/23leonhardt.html NYT-Why Budget Cuts Don't Bring Prosperity-February 2011]</ref> . 

GAO estimates that (absent policy changes) state and local governments will face budget gaps that rise from 1% of GDP in 2010 to around 2% by 2020, 2.5% by 2030, and 3.5% by 2040. <ref>[http://www.rockinst.org/pdf/health_care/2009-11-19-boyd-state_budgets_health_care_NAPA.pdf Rockefeller Institute-Boyd-Presentation-November 2009]</ref> . 

Further, many states have underfunded pensions, meaning the state has not contributed the amount estimated to be necessary to pay future obligations to retired workers.  The Pew Center on the States reported in February 2010 that states have underfunded their pensions by nearly $1 trillion as of 2008, representing the gap between the $2.35 trillion states had set aside to pay for employees’ retirement benefits and the $3.35 trillion price tag of those promises. <ref>[http://www.pewcenteronthestates.org/report_detail.aspx?id=56695 Pew Center on the States-The Trillion Dollar Gap-February 2010]</ref> . 

Whether a U.S. state can declare [[bankruptcy]], enabling it to re-negotiate its obligations to bondholders, pensioners, and public employee unions is a matter of legal and political debate. Journalist [[Matthew Miller (journalist)|Matt Miller]] explained some of these issues in February 2011: "The AG [State Attorney General] might put a plan forward and agree to conditions. However, the AG has no say over the legislature. And only a legislature can raise taxes. In some cases, it would require a state constitutional amendment to reduce pensions. Add to this a federal judge who would oversee the process...and a state has sovereign immunity, which means the governor or legislature may simply refuse to go along with anything the judge rules or reject the reorganization plan itself."<ref>[http://www.thedeal.com/magazine/ID/038443/2011/the-world-wonders-can-states-go-bankrupt.php Matt Miller-The Deal-February 2011-The World Wonders, Can States Go Bankrupt?]</ref> . 

===Entitlement trust funds===. 
{{See also|Social Security Trust Fund}}
Both Social Security and Medicare are funded by payroll tax revenues dedicated to those programs. Program tax revenues historically have exceeded payouts, resulting in program surpluses and the building of trust fund balances. The trust funds earn interest. Both Social Security and Medicare each have two component trust funds. As of FY2008, Social Security had a combined $2.4 trillion trust fund balance and Medicare's was $380 billion. If during an individual year program payouts exceed the sum of tax income and interest earned during that year (i.e., an annual program deficit), the trust fund for the program is drawn down to the extent of the shortfall. Legally, the mandatory nature of these programs compels the government to fund them to the extent of tax income plus any remaining trust fund balances, borrowing as needed. Once the trust funds are eliminated through expected future deficits, technically these programs can only draw on payroll taxes during the current year. In effect, they are "pay as you go" programs, with additional legal claims to the extent of their remaining trust fund balances. <ref name="ssa.gov">[http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TRSUM/index.html Social Security Trustees Report - 2009 Summary]</ref> . 

===Credit rating downgrade===. 
{{Main|United States federal government credit rating downgrade, 2011}} . 

In April 2011, rating agency [[Standard & Poor's]] (S&P) issued a "negative" outlook on the U.S. "AAA" (highest quality) debt rating for the first time since the rating agency began in 1860, indicating there is a one in three chance of an outright reduction in the rating over the next two years. According to S&P, meaningful progress towards balancing the budget would be required to move the U.S. back to a "stable" outlook. <ref>[http://www.standardandpoors.com/ratings/articles/en/us/?assetID=1245302886884 S&P Press Release-April 18, 2011]</ref> Losing the AAA rating would likely mean higher interest rates and the sale of treasury bonds by entities required to hold AAA securities. <ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42643641/ns/business-eye_on_the_economy/ MSNBC-S&P Issues Negative Outlook-April 19, 2011]</ref> . 

On August 5, 2011, representatives from S&P announced the company's decision to give a first-ever downgrade to U.S. sovereign debt, lowering the rating one notch to "AA+", with a negative outlook. S&P wrote: "The downgrade reflects our opinion that the [[Budget Control Act of 2011|fiscal consolidation plan]] that Congress and the Administration recently agreed to falls short of what, in our view, would be necessary to stabilize the government's medium-term debt dynamics...the effectiveness,
stability, and predictability of American policy-making and political institutions have weakened at a time of ongoing fiscal and economic challenges to a degree more than we envisioned when we assigned a negative outlook to the rating on April 18, 2011."<ref name=Swann-Augpr>{{cite press release|author=Swann, Nikola G et. al (Standard & Poor's)|title=United States of America Long-Term Rating Lowered To 'AA+' Due To Political Risks, Rising Debt Burden; Outlook Negative|url=http://www.standardandpoors.com/ratings/articles/en/us/?assetID=1245316529563|date=August 5, 2011|publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies|accessdate=August 5, 2011}}</ref><ref name=Swann-Aug>{{cite web|url=http://www.standardandpoors.com/servlet/BlobServer?blobheadername3=MDT-Type&blobcol=urldata&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobheadervalue2=inline%3B+filename%3DUS_Downgraded_AA%2B.pdf&blobheadername2=Content-Disposition&blobheadervalue1=application%2Fpdf&blobkey=id&blobheadername1=content-type&blobwhere=1243942957443&blobheadervalue3=UTF-8 |title=United States of America Long-Term Rating Lowered To 'AA+' On Political Risks And Rising Debt Burden; Outlook Negative |publisher=Standardandpoors.com |date=August 5, 2011 |accessdate=August 7, 2011}}</ref> .
