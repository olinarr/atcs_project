He was raised and remains a Roman Catholic.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} He graduated from [[La Salle High School (Cincinnati, Ohio)|La Salle High School]] in Cincinnati, and then from the [[College of William and Mary]] in 1975, earning a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in history.

He worked as an elementary school teacher in 1975–1976 while taking law classes at night.  . 

As a practicing attorney from 1978 to 1994, Chabot was a sole practitioner, operating out of small law office in Westwood. <ref>Paul Barton, [http://www.enquirer.com/editions/1999/01/14/loc_chabot_sure.html "Chabot guaranteed place in textbooks"], ''Cincinnati Enquirer, January 14, 1999</ref> such as domestic disputes and the drafting of wills. <ref>Juliet Eilperin, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/managers011499.htm "Like-Minded Team of 13 to Present House's Case"], ''Washington Post'', January 14, 1999</ref> . 

==Early political career==. 
Chabot ran unsuccessfully for the Cincinnati City Council as an independent candidate in 1979 and as a Republican in 1983. Then, running as a Republican, he won a seat in 1985 and was re-elected in 1987 and 1989. In 1988, he ran for the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] against seven-term incumbent Democrat [[Tom Luken]], who defeated Chabot 56%-44%. <ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=28386</ref> After that, he was appointed a Commissioner of [[Hamilton County, Ohio]] in 1990, and was elected later that year and again in 1992, staying until 1994.  .

===Elections===. 
In 1994, he ran for the U.S. House again and defeated Democratic incumbent [[David S. Mann]] of [[Ohio's 1st congressional district]], 56%-44%. The race was over balanced budgets and abortion. <ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=28208</ref> In 1996, Chabot was a top target from Democrats, but he defeated Democrat Mark Longabaugh, member of the Cincinnati City Council, 54%-43%. <ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=28118</ref> In 1998, he defeated popular Cincinnati Mayor [[Roxanne Qualls]], 53% to 47%. <ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=28058</ref> In the series of debates during that campaign, Qualls criticized Chabot for not funneling enough federal spending back to his home district. Chabot countered that he would not support "wasteful or unnecessary" federal programs. <ref name=autogenerated1>http://nationaljournal.com/pubs/almanac/2006/people/oh/rep_oh01.htm{{Dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Wilkinson|first=Howard|title=Chabot, Qualls debate pork vs. fair share|newspaper=The Cincinnati Enquirer|date=1998-10-28|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/1998/10/28/loc_first28.html|accessdate=2009-10-28}}</ref> In 2000, he defeated City Councilman and Harvard graduate [[John Cranley]] 53%-44%. <ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=570</ref> In 2002, he defeated [[Greg Harris (Ohio)|Greg Harris]], with 65% of the vote. <ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=570</ref> In 2004, he defeated Greg Harris again, with 60% of the vote. <ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=1226</ref> .

[[File:Steve chabot memorial day speech 2006.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Representative Steve Chabot giving a speech at a Memorial Day ceremony in [[North College Hill, Ohio]], May 27, 2006.]] . 

Chabot had a conservative voting record and was a member of the [[Republican Study Committee]].  . 

Chabot served as one of 12 "managers" in the Senate Impeachment trial for President Bill Clinton.  . 

As Chairman of the House Subcommittee on the Constitution, Chabot authored the legislation to ban the practice of partial-birth abortion. President George W. Bush signed the bill into law on November 5, 2003. <ref>{{cite web|title=Steve Chabot - Legislative Issues|work=US House web site|year=2008|url=http://www.house.gov/chabot/issues.html|accessdate=2009-10-28|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080202125443/http://www.house.gov/chabot/issues.html|archivedate=2008-02-02}}</ref> . 

Chabot is a strong advocate for fiscal responsibility, and has pursued a fiscally conservative standard for the government. Anti-tax advocacy groups such as [[Citizens Against Government Waste]], the [[Concord Coalition]], and the [[National Taxpayers Union]] consistently rated Chabot as one of the most anti-tax members of Congress. <ref>[http://www.ntu.org/main/components/ratescongress/details_all_years.php3?house_id=490 National Taxpayers Union - Rates Congress Database]</ref> . 

Chabot's work in Congress included the elimination of logging subsidies in the Tongass National Forest in Alaska,<ref>{{Cite news|title=Cut it out - Stop spending taxpayers' money to build roads for timber companies|newspaper=The Columbus Dispatch - Editorial|date=2006-05-16|url=http://www.dispatch.com/editorials-story.php?story=dispatch/2006/05/16/20060516-A8-02.html|accessdate=2009-10-28}}</ref> co-sponsored the Voting Rights Act reauthorization,<ref>[http://judiciary.house.gov/printshop.aspx?Section=110 Printshop]</ref> and promoted relations with Taiwan. <ref>{{Cite news|last=Snyder|first=Charles|title=US House adopts measure on Taiwan|newspaper=Taipei Times|page=1|date=2006-06-30|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2006/06/30/2003316410|accessdate=2009-10-28}}</ref> Chabot opposes abortion except if the mother's life is in danger or in cases of rape and incest. Chabot authorized a bill, which passed the House but not the Senate, to make it illegal to take a minor across state lines for an abortion. Chabot has voted to restrict federal funding for embryonic stem cell research.  . 

In 2002, Chabot helped spearhead the local campaign against building a [[MetroMoves|light rail system]] in [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]]. <ref name="missing_the_bus">{{Cite news|last=Monk|first=Dan|coauthors=Lucy May|title=Missing the bus|newspaper=Business Courier of Cincinnati|pages=1, 12|date=2001-05-11|url=http://cincinnati.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/2001/05/14/story1.html?q=%20Missing%20the%20bus%20,%20Business%20Courier%20of%20Cincinnati|accessdate=2009-10-28}}</ref> In that same year, Chabot and [[John Boehner‎]] advocated teaching [[intelligent design]] alongside the [[theory of evolution]] by [[natural selection]] in Ohio high schools. <ref>{{cite news|title=Scientific Boehner: The new creationism and the congressmen who support it|last=Murray|first=Iaian|date=June 5, 2002|publisher=The American Prospect|url=http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=scientific_boehner|accessdate=2009-10-28}}</ref> . 

Chabot was a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, he cosponsored H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition and Enforcement Act,<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.04777: Thomas (Library of Congress): HR 4777]</ref> and voted for H.R. 4411, the [[Goodlatte]]-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act. <ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.04411: Thomas (Library of Congress): HR 4411]</ref> In 2007, Chabot voted against the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Plan (S-CHIP) which would have expanded S-CHIP to cover four million more participants. The bill passed the House and Senate, however President Bush vetoed the bill on October 3, 2007. Chabot voted against the veto-override.  . 

Chabot conducted a Town Hall meeting with his constituents on August 22, 2011 where video cameras were banned. During the meeting two citizens had video cameras seized by a police officer. The incident was captured by one of the seized cameras and by press cameras that were allowed to record the meeting. A Chabot spokesman stated that video cameras will be allowed at the next town hall meeting. <ref>HWilkinson, [http://cincinnati.com/blogs/politics/2011/08/24/democrats-cameras-seized-by-police-at-chabot-town-hall-meeting/], "Democrats’ cameras seized by police at Chabot Town Hall meeting", ''Cincinnati.com'', August 24, 2011</ref><ref>Kurt Nimmo, [http://nation.foxnews.com/town-hall/2011/08/24/cops-confiscate-cameras-ohio-congressman-s-town-hall,] "Cops Confiscate Cameras at Ohio Congressman’s Town Hall", August 24, 2011</ref> . 

;Environment
The group [[Republicans for Environmental Protection]] issued Chabot an "environmental harm demerit" in 2006 for contributing to [[urban sprawl]] by sponsoring H.R. 4772, a bill that allows land use disputes to proceed immediately to federal court; according to the organization, the bill "would have undermined local control over local planning and zoning matters, a central principle of America's federal system."<ref>[http://www.rep.org/2006_scorecard.pdf Republicans for Environmental Protection 2006 Scorecard]</ref> In the same year, the group praised Chabot for offering legislation "prohibiting the [[National Forest Service|Forest Service]] from spending taxpayer dollars to build new [[logging road]]s for private interests in the [[Tongass National Forest]]. The nonpartisan [[League of Conservation Voters]] gave Chabot a grade of 10% for the 109th Congress, noting that he voted "anti-environment" on 11 out of 12 issues selected by that organization as crucial; his lifetime grade from the LCV is 23%. <ref>[http://www.lcv.org/images/client/pdfs/LCV_2006_Scorecard_final.pdf League of Conservation Voters 2006 National Scorecard]</ref> . 

In June 2007, Chabot sponsored an amendment to block federally-funded road building in Tongass National Forest. Proponents of the amendment said that the federal timber program in Tongass is a dead loss for taxpayers, costing some $30 million annually, and noted that the Forest Service faces an estimated $900 million road maintenance backlog in the forest. Supporters of the bipartisan amendment included the [[Republicans for Environmental Protection]]. Of the bill, Representative Chabot said "I am not opposed to logging when it's done on the timber company's dime...But in this case, they are using the American taxpayer to subsidize these 200 jobs at the tune of $200,000 per job. That just makes no sense". <ref>[http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jun2007/2007-06-28-10.asp U.S. House Boosts Spending for Environment, Conservation]</ref> . 

;Earmarks
Chabot was a longtime critic of [[pork barrel]] spending and of federal funding for the arts. "I wasn't sent up here to bring pork back to my district" he told the ''[[Cincinnati Post]]'' in 1995. {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} In previous Congresses, he has cosponsored bills that would have abolished the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]]. However, the fiscal 2007 Labor HHS Education appropriations bill did include $1.6 million in earmarks for the [[Cincinnati Museum Center]], the [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]], [[Xavier University (Cincinnati)|Xavier University]], the [[University of Cincinnati]] and the [[Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center]]. All five organizations have members on their board of directors who are also members of Chabot's inner circle of contributors and fundraisers. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} . 

Gary Lindgren, Chabot's chief of staff, said that "there's not a connection" between the donations and the earmarks. Lindgren said the earmarks are for major institutions where it would be expected that board members would be politically active. "You could look at almost any district, and the people who sit on boards of museums and institutions will be wealthy and donate to campaigns", said Tom Schatz, president of Citizens Against Government Waste. Schatz noted that Chabot has won high marks from CAGW in the past. <ref>Jonathan Allen, [http://www.thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/091906/chabot.html "Chabot aims earmarks at places linked to donors"], ''The Hill'', September 19, 2006</ref> .
