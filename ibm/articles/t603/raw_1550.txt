'''''Pork barrel''''' is the [[Appropriation (law)|appropriation]] of government spending for localized projects secured solely or primarily to bring money to a representative's district. The usage originated in [[American English]]. <ref>{{cite web|author=By Michael W.

==History==. 
The term ''pork barrel politics'' usually refers to spending that is intended to benefit [[Electoral district|constituents]] of a [[politician]] in return for their political support, either in the form of [[Campaign finance|campaign contributions]] or votes. In the popular 1863 story "The Children of the Public", [[Edward Everett Hale]] used the term ''pork barrel'' as a homely metaphor for any form of public spending to the citizenry. <ref>The story first appeared in ''[[Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper]],'' Jan. 24 and Jan. 31, 1863. {{Cite document

He claimed that the phrase originated in a pre-Civil War practice of giving slaves a barrel of salt pork as a reward and requiring them to compete among themselves to get their share of the handout. <ref>

More generally, a barrel of [[salt pork]] was a common [[larder]] item in 19th century households, and could be used as a measure of the family's financial well-being. For example, in his 1845 novel ''The Chainbearer'', [[James Fenimore Cooper]] wrote, "I hold a family to be in a desperate way, when the mother can see the bottom of the pork barrel."<ref>

==Definition==. 
Typically, "pork" involves funding for government programs whose [[economic]] or service benefits are concentrated in a particular area but whose costs are spread among all taxpayers. [[Public works]] projects, certain national defense spending projects, and [[agricultural subsidies]] are the most commonly cited examples.  . 

[[Citizens Against Government Waste]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cagw.org/site/PageServer?pagename=reports_pigbook2006#criteria |title=Citizens Against Government Waste: |publisher=Cagw.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-14}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> outlines seven criteria by which spending can be classified as "pork":
# Requested by only one chamber of Congress;
# Not specifically authorized;
# Not competitively awarded;
# Not requested by the President;
# Greatly exceeds the President’s budget request or the previous year’s funding;
# Not the subject of congressional hearings; or
# Serves only a local or special interest.  . 

== Examples ==. 
One of the earliest examples of pork barrel politics in the United States was the [[Bonus Bill of 1817]], which was introduced by [[John C. Calhoun]] to construct [[highways]] linking the Eastern and Southern United States to its [[Frontier#The U.S. frontier|Western frontier]] using the earnings bonus from the [[Second Bank of the United States]]. Calhoun argued for it using general welfare and post roads clauses of the [[United States Constitution]]. Although he approved of the economic development goal, President [[James Madison]] vetoed the bill as [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]]. 
<blockquote>
''1873 Defiance (Ohio) Democrat 13 Sept. 1/8:'' "Recollecting their many previous visits to the public pork-barrel,... this hue-and-cry over the salary grab... puzzles quite as much as it alarms them."<br/>
''1896 Overland Monthly Sept. 370/2:'' "Another illustration represents Mr. Ford in the act of hooking out a chunk of River and Harbor Pork out of a Congressional Pork Barrel valued at two hundred and fifty thousand dollars."
</blockquote>
One of the most famous alleged pork-barrel projects was the [[Big Dig (Boston, Massachusetts)|Big Dig]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. The Big Dig was a project to take an existing {{convert|3.5|mi|km|sing=on}} [[interstate highway]] and relocate it underground.  It ended up costing US$14.6 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]], or over US$4 billion per mile. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/08/06/big_dig_failures_threaten_federal_funding/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Big Dig failures threaten federal funding | date=August 6, 2006 | first1=Rick | last1=Klein}}</ref> [[Tip O'Neill]] (D-Mass), after whom one of the Big Dig tunnels was named, pushed to have the Big Dig funded by the federal government while he was the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]].

During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential campaign]], the [[Gravina Island Bridge]] (also known as the "Bridge to Nowhere") in Alaska was cited as an example of pork barrel spending. The bridge, pushed for by Republican Senator [[Ted Stevens]], was projected to cost $398 million and would connect the island's 50 residents and the [[Ketchikan International Airport]] to [[Revillagigedo Island]] and [[Ketchikan]]. <ref>[http://www.taxpayer.net/user_uploads/file/Transportation/gravinabridge.pdf $315 Million Bridge to Nowhere] Taxpayers for Common Sense, February 9, 2005</ref>

Pork-barrel projects, or ''[[Earmark (politics)|earmarks]]'', are added to the federal budget by members of the appropriation committees of [[United States Congress]]. This allows delivery of federal funds to the local district or state of the appropriation committee member, often accommodating major campaign contributors. To a certain extent, a member of Congress is judged by their ability to deliver funds to their constituents. The Chairman and the [[ranking member]] of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations]] are in a position to deliver significant benefits to their states.  . 

==Use of the term outside the United States==. 
In other countries, the practice is often called [[patronage]], but this word does not always imply corrupt or undesirable conduct.  . 

=== Philippines ===. 
In the Philippines, the term is commonly used in politics. Filipino legislators are allocated large sums of the annual national budget (200 million pesos for each senator and 70 million for each representative) in a program called the Priority Development Assistance Fund. Politicians are often accused of misusing their allocations for selfish purposes, particularly through "kickbacks" and commissions from their projects. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://ph.news.yahoo.com/star/20090831/tph-palace-increases-pork-by-p700-millio-541dfb4.html |title=Yahoo!

=== Scandinavia ===. 
Similar expressions, meaning "election pork", are used in Danish (''{{lang|da|valgflæsk}}''), Swedish (''{{lang|sv|valfläsk}}'') and Norwegian (''{{lang|no|valgflesk}}''), where they mean promises made ''before'' an election, often by a politician who has little intention of fulfilling them. <ref>''[[Nationalencyklopedin]]'', NE Nationalencyklopedin AB. Article ''Valfläsk''</ref>

=== Central and Eastern Europe ===. 
Romanians speak of ''{{lang|ro|pomeni electorale}}'' (literally, "electoral alms"), while the Polish ''{{lang|pl|kiełbasa wyborcza}}'' means literally "election sausage". The Czech ''{{lang|cs|předvolební guláš}}'' (pre-election [[goulash]]) has similar meaning, referring to free dishes of [[goulash]] served to potential voters during election campaign meetings targeted at lower social classes; metaphorically, it stands for any populistic political decisions that are taken before the elections with the aim of obtaining more votes. The process of diverting budget funds in favor of a project in a particular constituency is called ''{{lang|cs|porcování medvěda}}'' ("portioning of the bear") in Czech usage. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.cz/detail.jsp?id=11172 |title=Porcování medvěda zvítězilo nad ideály - EURO |publisher=Euro.cz |date= |accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref> .
