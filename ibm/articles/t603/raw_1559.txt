'''Citizens Against Government Waste''' ('''CAGW''') is a [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit]] organization in the [[United States]]. It functions as a [[think-tank]], 'government watchdog', and [[advocacy group]] for [[fiscally conservative]] causes.  The Council for Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW) is the lobbying arm of CAGW, organized as a section [[501(c)(4)]] organization, and therefore permitted to engage in direct [[Lobbying in the United States|lobbying]] activities. CAGW has been criticized for its links to the [[tobacco industry]] and to lobbyists including [[Jack Abramoff]].  According to their web site, "CAGW is a private, non-partisan, non-profit organization representing more than one million members and supporters nationwide. CAGW's mission is to eliminate waste, mismanagement, and [[economic inefficiency|inefficiency]] in the federal government."      . 

__TOC__ . 

==History==. 
Located in [[Washington, DC]], CAGW was founded in 1984 by [[industrialist]] [[J. Peter Grace]] and [[Print syndication|syndicated]] [[columnist]] [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]], former members of [[the Grace Commission]] or President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1985/102885a.htm | title = Remarks on Receiving the Final Report of the President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control in the Federal Government | publisher =  President Ronald Reagan Speech October 28, 1985 | accessdate = April 29, 2008}}</ref>
CAGW's current President is Thomas A. Schatz.  Schatz has been president since 1992. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://frontpagemag.com/Articles/Read.aspx?GUID=023E7D5B-AAE2-47C7-9F4F-226AA824ABDA | title = A Hole in the Government’s Pocket | publisher =  FrontPage Magazine | accessdate = April 29, 2008}}</ref> . 

==Publications== . 

CAGW produces a number of publications critical of what it calls "[[pork-barrel]]" projects. The ''Congressional Pig Book Summary'' (Pig Book) is an annual list of such projects and their sponsors.  . 

The 2008 Pig Book identified 10,610 projects in the 11 appropriations bills that constitute the discretionary portion of the federal budget for fiscal 2008, costing taxpayers $17.2 billion. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23923948/ | title = 'Pig book' puts pet spending in spotlight | publisher =  MSNBC | accessdate = April 29, 2008}}</ref> Related publications include Prime Cuts, a list of recommendations for eliminating waste in the federal government and Porker of the Month, a monthly press release.  . 

Also, since 1989, the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW) has examined Congressional [[roll-call vote]]s to determine which members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] are voting in what they view as the interest of taxpayers. CAGW makes public what legislators are engaging in "pork-barrel" spending based on 'key' votes for each congressional session.  . 

==Activity of CAGW== . 

CAGW and CCAGW seek to influence public policy through public education, lobbying, and mobilization for email- and letter-writing campaigns. CAGW claims to have helped save taxpayers $944 billion through the implementation of Grace Commission findings and other recommendations.    . 

CAGW was one of the  critics of the 2001 $23.5 billion [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] plan to lease and then buy 100 refueling tankers from [[Boeing Co.]]  Congress squashed the plan after it was revealed that an Air Force official inflated the price in exchange for an executive job at Boeing. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.commondreams.org/news2001/1220-02.htm | title = Right-Left Coalition Denounces Boeing Corporate Welfare Deal  | publisher =  CommonDreams.org | accessdate = April 29, 2008}}</ref> . 

CAGW was a prominent critic of Sen. [[John Thune]] (R-S.D.) and his efforts to secure a record $2.3 billion federal loan for a railroad company that once employed him as a lobbyist.  The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) cited an “unacceptably high risk to taxpayers” in denying the loan to the Dakota, Minnesota, and Eastern Railroad (DM&E) in 2007. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rapidcityjournal.com/articles/2007/03/17/news/top/news00m_thune_porker_award.txt | title = Sen. Thune avoids being named 'Porker of the Year’ | publisher =  Rapid City Journal | accessdate = April 29, 2008}}</ref> . 

CAGW named [[Christopher Dodd]] (D-Conn.) its June 2008 Porker of the Month for accepting a preferential mortgage deal from [[Countrywide Financial]] which stood to benefit from a mortgage [[bailout]] bill he was pushing through Congress. <ref>[http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20080624005211&newsLang=en CAGW Names Sen.

==Controversies==. 
===Microsoft's Antitrust Case (Litigation)===. 
In 2001, the [[Los Angeles Times]] reported that at least two dead people sent a form letter by CAGW opposing the [[antitrust]] case against [[Microsoft]] to Utah [[Attorney General]] [[Mark Shurtleff]]. According to the Times, family members crossed out the names on the form letters and signed for them. This brought about the "Microsoft Supported by Dead People" controversy<ref>{{cite web | last = Olavsrud | first = Thor | date =  August 23, 2001 | url = http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/871631 | title = Microsoft Supported by Dead People | publisher = InternetNews.com | accessdate = December 19, 2006}}</ref> from Microsoft's and CAGW's opponents. The CAGW said that they were not tied to Microsoft or to [[Americans for Technology Leadership|ATL]], although Microsoft has donated money to CAGW. <ref>{{cite web | last = Schatz | first = Thomas A. | date = August 23, 2001 | url = http://www.mail-archive.com/politech@politechbot.com/msg00154.html | title = CAGW Criticizes LA Times Story | publisher =  politech | accessdate = December 19, 2006}}</ref> . 

===Freeware Initiative===. 
In 2003, CAGW put out a press release  opposed to what they called the "Freeware Initiative", which they claimed would have required  that all IT expenditures for [[Massachusetts]] in 2004 and 2005 be made on an open-source/Linux format". <ref>[http://councilfor.cagw.org/site/PageServer?pagename=news_NewsRelease_09302003b&JServSessionIdr007=xdomc1du42.app26a Citizens Against Government Waste: NewsRelease_09302003b<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  . 

Responding to the press release, the state's secretary for administration and finance, Eric Kriss, denied the existence of a 'Freeware Initiative' and said the state was simply considering ways to integrate disparate systems using open standards such as HTTP ([[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]]), XML ([[Extensible Markup Language]]) and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. "I never heard that term. I never said it. We're not pursuing any kind of 'Freeware Initiative' and anyone who is saying that is making inaccurate statements," he said. <ref>[http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/10/03/HNmassopen_1.html Mass. official: "Open source" reports overstated | InfoWorld | News | 2003-10-03 | By Paul Roberts, IDG News Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . 

===CAGW and tobacco=== . 

The [[St. Petersburg Times]] reported that CAGW "got at least $245,000 from the tobacco industry", and subsequently lobbied on its behalf.  Internal tobacco industry documents made available by the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement indicate that CAGW and its affiliates supported the tobacco industry in several instances. Specifically, in 2001, when an industry-sponsored bill entitled the "Youth Smoking Reduction Act" was introduced in Congress, CAGW sent a letter supporting this legislation. <ref>[http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/gpx21c00/pdf?search=%22citizens%20against%20government%20waste%22], Letter supporting Youth Smoking Reduction Act by CAGW</ref> On the contrary, most public health and medical organizations, wrote a letter strongly opposing the legislation. They stated that despite the name of the bill, if enacted, "would do more harm than good to the public health."<ref>[http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/kpx21c00/pdf], Letter against Youth Smoking Reduction Act by several public health agencies</ref> CAGW was also contacted by Phillip Morris to include ASSIST, a federal tobacco control program, in their Pig Book. ASSIST was considered an imminent threat to industry activities at the time. <ref>[http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/azf36c00/pdf], Recap of ASSIST Meeting</ref>  . 

Asked about his group's tobacco work, CAGW president Tom Schatz said, "We have always welcomed contributions to support the issues we support. Many of them have to do with fighting higher taxes and more regulations."<ref>[http://www.sptimes.com/2006/04/02/Worldandnation/When_tobacco_needed_a.shtml When tobacco needed a voice, CAGW spoke up and profited], St. Petersburg Times, ''April 2, 2006''</ref>
<ref>[http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/kpx21c00/pdf (kpx21c00)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . 

===Other controversies=== . 

Throughout its history, CAGW has been accused of fronting lobbying efforts of corporations to give them the appearance of "[[grassroots]]" support. <ref name="forprice">[http://www.sptimes.com/2006/04/02/Worldandnation/For_price__watchdog_w.shtml For price, watchdog will be an advocate], St. Petersburg Times, ''April 2, 2006''</ref> In part, this is because CAGW has accepted donations from [[Altria Group|Phillip Morris]], the [[Olin Foundation]], the [[Bradley Foundation]], Microsoft, [[Merrill Lynch]], and [[Exxon-Mobil]].  . 

According to the St. Petersburg Times in 2006, the Pig Book has been used to benefit corporate donors, specifically health clubs who donated to CAGW.  The Pig Book listed federal grants to [[YMCA]]s who compete with those [[health clubs]] as waste.  CAGW's president countered that "The Ys are there because they qualify as pork. Period."<ref name="forprice"/>   . 

A Senate Finance Committee investigating ties between CAGW and other non-profits and [[Jack Abramoff]] in 2006 stated in a report that the non-profits:  'probably violated their tax-exempt status "by laundering payments and then disbursing funds at Mr. Abramoff's direction; taking payments in exchange for writing newspaper columns or press releases that put Mr. Abramoff's clients in a favorable light; introducing Mr. Abramoff's clients to government officials in exchange for payment; and agreeing to act as a front organization for congressional trips paid for by Mr. Abramoff's clients."'<ref name="CAGW and Abramoff">{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/12/AR2006101200889_pf.html |publisher=Washington Post |title=Senate Report: Five Nonprofit Groups Sold Clout to Abramoff |date=2006-10-12 | first1=James V. | last1=Grimaldi | first2=Susan | last2=Schmidt | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}</ref> . 

In 2007, CAGW supported a bill that would limit damages resulting from [[malpractice]] lawsuits. <ref>http://www.cagw.org/site/VoteCenter?page=voteInfo&voteId=4964</ref> Many consumer watchdog groups opposed the bill. <ref>http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/nw/?postId=5176</ref> . 

In 2009, CAGW had been lobbying against the [[F136]] alternate engine for the [[F-35 Lightning II|F-35]] JSF made by [[GE]]/[[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls Royce]]. A  [[GE]] Aviation spokesperson said it was always a strong suspicion that CAGW was funded by [[Pratt & Whitney]](which manufactures the [[F135]] engine for the JSF)<ref name="The_Hill">{{cite news |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/64441-f-35-is-subject-of-consumer-watchdogs-big-media-blitz-|publisher=The Hill|title=F-35 is the subject of watchdog’s media blitz|date=2009-10-23}}</ref> but a [[Pratt & Whitney]] spokesperson said they weren't funding CAGW's lobbying efforts. <ref name="The_Hill"/> . 

In October 2010, CAGW introduced a television [[attack ad]] suggesting that economic stimulus spending, health care reform, and other actions characterized as "turning their back on the principles that made them great" would lead to the downfall of the US and an economic takeover by [[People's Republic of China|China]]. <ref>[http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/10/the-phenomenal-chinese-professor-ad/64982/ "The Phenomenal 'Chinese Professor' Ad"].
