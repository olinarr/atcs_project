[[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[John McCain]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Arizona|AZ]]), a member of the [[U.S. Congress]] since 1983, a two-time U.S. presidential candidate, and the nominee of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. Presidential election]], has taken positions on many political issues through his public comments, his presidential campaign statements, and his senatorial voting record.  . 

Online, McCain uses his Senate web site<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Issues.Home |title=Issues|accessdate=June 14, 2008 |date= |work=John McCain official Senate website}}</ref> and his 2008 campaign web site<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/ |title=Issues |accessdate=June 14, 2008 |date= |work=JohnMcCain.com }}</ref> to describe his political positions.  . 

Regarding the general notion of consistency of political positions over time, McCain said in June 2008: "My principles and my practice and my voting record are very clear. Not only from 2000 but 1998 and 1992 and 1986. And you know, it's kind of a favorite tactical ploy now that opponents use, of saying the person has changed. Look, none of my principles or values have changed. Have I changed position on some specific issues because of changed circumstances? I would hope so! I would hope so!"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/06/20/magazines/fortune/Evolution_McCain_Whitford.fortune/index.htm?postversion=2008062311 | title=The evolution of John McCain | author=[[David Whitford]] |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] | date=June 23, 2008 | accessdate=June 23, 2008}}</ref> It is often reported that McCain has grown more conservative throughout his tenure in the [[Senate of the United States|Senate]], according to various studies. <ref>http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/mccain-s-shift-makes-him-senate-s-most-conservative-20110224</ref>

==Economic policy==. 
McCain's 2006 rating by the [[Almanac of American Politics]] (2008) on Economic Policy is 64% conservative, 35% liberal (52% conservative, 47% liberal in 2005). <ref name="aap-08-ratings">{{cite book | title = ''Almanac of American Politics (2008)'' | author=Barone, Michael and Cohen, Richard | publisher=National Journal | year=2008 | page = 95 | isbn = 0892341173}}</ref>  McCain fleshed out the main points of his economic plan in an April 15, 2008 speech at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in Pennsylvania. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/15/us/politics/15text-mccain.html|title=McCain on the Economy at Carnegie Mellon University|date=April 15, 2008|work=New York Times|accessdate=May 17, 2008}} (Full text of speech.)</ref><ref name="cseconomy">{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0428/p02s02-uspo.html|title=McCain fleshes out his economic plan|date=April 28, 2008|author=Peter Grier|publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|accessdate=May 17, 2008}}</ref>  In summary, McCain would make the [[Bush tax cuts]] permanent instead of letting them expire, he would eliminate the [[Alternative Minimum Tax]] in order to assist the middle-class, he would double the [[personal exemption]] for dependents, reduce the [[corporate tax]] rate, and offer a new [[research and development]] tax credit. <ref name="cseconomy" /> At the same time, he pledges to eliminate [[pork-barrel]] spending, freeze nondefense [[discretionary spending]] for a year or more, and reduce [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] growth. <ref name="cseconomy" />  He is also opposed to extravagant salaries and severance deals of corporate CEOs. <ref name="cseconomy" /><ref>Salzman, Avi.

McCain had declined to sign the pledge of the group [[Americans for Tax Reform]] to not add any new taxes or increase existing taxes. <ref name="notaxcutpledge">Donald Limbro, "GOP 'darlings' slow to sign tax-cut pledge", ''Washington Times'', February 22, 2007. </ref> However, after he lost the presidential election in 2008, McCain became a signer of [[Americans_for_Tax_Reform#Taxpayer_Protection_Pledge|Americans for Tax Reform]]’s [[Taxpayer Protection Pledge]]. <ref name ="ATR">{{cite web|title=The Taxpayer Protection Pledge Signers 112th Congressional List|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/atrfiles/files/files/091411-federalpledgesigners.pdf|publisher=Americans for Tax Reform|accessdate=November 30, 2011}}</ref> In 2002, Sen. McCain was one of only two Republicans to twice vote against the permanent repeal of the Estate Tax,<ref name=autogenerated3 /> and has recently stated opposition to a permanent repeal of the Estate Tax. <ref>Stephen Dinan, "McCain Embraces Tax Cut Turnaround," The Washington Times, December 19, 2007</ref>  McCain was one of two Republicans who voted against Bush's tax cuts in 2001. He opposed accelerating the cuts in 2003, saying that he was not in favor of cutting taxes during a time of war. <ref name=autogenerated5 /><ref name="notaxcutpledge"/> In 2004 McCain appeared on ''[[Meet The Press]]'' with [[Tim Russert]] where he was asked about his opposition to the Bush tax cuts. McCain explained himself by saying, "I voted against the tax cuts because of the disproportional amount that went to the wealthiest Americans. I would clearly support not extending those tax cuts in order to help address the deficit."<ref>NBC's "Meet The Press," 4/11/04</ref> However, McCain supported the [[Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005|Bush tax cut extension]] in May 2006,<ref name="pfspt">{{cite web |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/14/ |title=McCain switched on tax cuts |author=Holan, Angie Drobnic |work=PolitiFact |work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |accessdate=December 27, 2007}}</ref> and January 2008 he told Russert that he favors making those tax cuts permanent to prevent an increase in taxes while the economy was "shaky." He also said that his tax proposal would focus more on middle-income Americans than on the wealthy. <ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22867407/page/2/ Meet The Press Transcript: Jan. 27, 2008], NBC.com</ref> . 

McCain has stated that he believes in keeping marginal tax rates low, but that lower taxes work best "when accompanied by lower spending."<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/4a3ab6fe-b025-42b1-815b-13c696a61908.htm | title = One the Issues (Path to Lower Taxes) | publisher=johnmccain.com }}</ref>  . 

In January 2008, McCain said "“People talk about a stimulus package. Fine, if that's what we want to come up with. But stop the spending first.”<ref>[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/politics/20080118-0800-republicans-economy.html "McCain tells South Carolina voters federal spending is out of control"], ''Associated Press'', January 18, 2008</ref> . 

In a major economic speech on April 15, 2008, McCain proposed a number of tax reductions and backed away from his pledge to balance the budget by the end of his first term, saying it would take him eight years. His speech focused on cuts to corporate tax rates and the extension of the [[Bush tax cuts]], and also called for eliminating the alternative-minimum tax and doubling the value of exemptions for dependents to $7,000. This is in contrast to McCain's historical emphasis on [[Government budget deficit|deficit]] reduction over tax cuts. <ref name="mercury0416" /> McCain's proposal for decreasing the [[United States public debt|federal budget deficit]] includes reforming the "self-serving largesse that defines the current budget process." In the speech, McCain said that the savings from eliminating earmarks, reviewing federal programs and other budget reforms would be “on the order of $100 billion annually.”<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/16/us/politics/15cnd-mccain.html?ref=business Tax Cuts at Center of McCain's Economic Plan] Wall Street Journal, April 16, 2008</ref> . 

On July 8, 2008, in an interview, McCain said that "historically when you raise people's taxes, revenue goes down. Every time we cut capital gains taxes, there has been an increase in revenues."<ref>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0807/08/ltm.03.html Transcript, "American Morning" show, July 8, 2008], ''CNN'', retrieved July 9, 2008</ref> . 

===Defense spending===. 
McCain supports ending the [[C-17 Globemaster III|Boeing C-17 Globemaster III]], the [[Boeing YAL-1|Boeing YAL-1 Airborne Laser]], and the [[Boeing]] and [[Science Applications International Corporation]] [[Future Combat Systems]]. <ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/13/AR2008071301643_pf.html | title=The McCain Budget Plan |work=The Washington Post | date=July 14, 2008}}</ref> . 

===Pork barrel spending (earmarks)===. 
McCain has been called one of the Senate's most outspoken critics of [[pork barrel]] spending. <ref name="Spartacus">Howard Kurtz, [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-353276.html "McCain, Rising Up Against 'Spartacus'"], ''Washington Post'', May 13, 2002. </ref> 
On April 16, 2007, McCain gave a speech on the U.S. economy to the [[Economic Club of Memphis]]. He criticized wasteful spending and reiterated his promise to make any sponsors of pork or earmarks "famous" when he becomes president. <ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.wcsh6.com/news/article.aspx?storyid=57977 | title = McCain Criticizes Wasteful Spending In Memphis Speech | author=Erik Schelzig | date = April 16, 2007|agency=Associated Press   | accessdate =April 27, 2007 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> . 

In March 2008, [[Gannett News Service]] reported that McCain's home state of [[Arizona]] ranked last in federal earmarks, because three of the state's ten lawmakers in Washington – McCain and House Republicans [[Jeff Flake]] and [[John Shadegg]] – refuse to ask for any federal money for local projects. <ref>Diana Marrero, [http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2008-03-22-earmarks_N.htm "Alaska 1st, Ariz. last in pork spending"], Gannett News Service, March 22, 2008</ref> In March 2008, he was one of twenty-nine U.S. Senators, including [[Barack Obama|Obama]] and [[Hillary Clinton|Clinton]], to vote in favor of a one-year moratorium on earmarks. <ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/13/earmark.vote/ Senate rejects earmark moratorium"], CNN.com, March 14, 2008</ref> . 

McCain says he hopes to stop special interests from lobbying for special projects. His 2008 campaign website includes the statement that "The federal government spends too much money, squanders precious resources on questionable projects pushed by special interests, and ignores the priorities of the American taxpayer."<ref>{{cite web

===Free trade===. 
[[Image:McCain Iraq 2007 crop.jpg|thumb|U.S. Senator [[John McCain]]]] . 

McCain is a strong proponent of [[free trade]]. <ref name="oti-freetrade">{{cite web | url=http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/John_McCain_Free_Trade.htm | title=John McCain on Free Trade | publisher=On the Issues | accessdate=April 19, 2008}}</ref>  He supports the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), the existing [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) agreements, U.S. participation in the [[World Trade Organization]],<ref name="oti-freetrade"/> and opposes renegotiation of trade agreements,<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.votesmart.org/npat.php?can_id=53270#1062 2004 National Political Awareness Test]</ref> saying, "...the U.S. should engage in multilateral, regional and bilateral efforts to reduce barriers to trade, level the global playing field and build effective enforcement of global trading rules."<ref>[http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/4dbd2cc7-890e-47f1-882f-b8fc4cfecc78.htm John McCain 2008 – John McCain for President<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 2004, when McCain was asked, "Should trade agreements include provisions to address environmental concerns and to protect workers' rights?", he answered, "No."<ref name=autogenerated1 /> . 

Regarding [[protectionism]], in 2007 McCain said, "I'm a student of history. Every time the United States has become protectionist ... we've paid a very heavy price. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Acts in the 1930s were direct contributors to World War II. It sounds like a lot of fun to bash China and others, but free trade has been the engine of our economy. Free trade should be the continuing principle that guides this nation's economy."<ref name="oti-freetrade"/> . 

===Social Security and Medicare===. 
In June 1999, McCain said "The only way to increase the yield on [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] dollars is by allowing workers to make investment decisions for themselves; by empowering American families to invest, in most robust portfolios, a portion of their earnings for Social Security that they would otherwise pay in taxes to Social Security."<ref>[http://www.socialsecurity.org/daily/06-07-99.html "Excerpts from a speech by Senator John McCain, presidential candidate, on Social Security"], June 7, 1999</ref> In January 2000, he repeated his strong support for creating partially private Social Security accounts. <ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04EFDA1F3BF932A25752C0A9669C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all McCain to Propose Middle-Class Tax Cuts and Private Accounts Within Social Security] NY Times, January 11, 2000</ref> In 2004, he said, "Without privatization, I don't see how you can possibly, over time, make sure that young Americans are able to receive Social Security benefits."<ref>{{cite web| last = Scher| first = Bill | title = McCain Lies About Social Security Privatization | publisher=[[Yahoo!

In April 2008, McCain proposed that seniors with higher incomes should pay higher premiums for government-provided prescription drug benefits ([[Medicare Part D]]) as a way to reduce federal spending on health care. <ref>Michael D. Shear and Jonathan Weisman, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/14/AR2008041403056.html "McCain: Affluent Seniors Should Pay More for Drug Benefit"], ''Washington Post'', April 15, 2008</ref>   . 

As of May 2008, McCain's web site says:
<blockquote>John McCain will fight to save the future of Social Security and believes that we may meet our obligations to the retirees of today and the future without raising taxes. John McCain supports supplementing the current Social Security system with personal accounts – but not as a substitute for addressing benefit promises that cannot be kept. <ref>[http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/0B8E4DB8-5B0C-459F-97EA-D7B542A78235.htm "Reforming Entitlement Programs For The 21st century: Reform Social Security"], JohnMcCain.com. Retrieved May 18, 2008. </ref></blockquote> . 

On June 12, 2008, McCain fielded a question in a town hall meeting, saying, "But I'm not for quote privatizing Social Security, I never have been, I never will be."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/13/john-mccain-denies-social_n_106935.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Will | last=Thomas | title=John McCain Denies Social Security Comments | date=June 13, 2008}}</ref> . 

On July 7, 2008, McCain criticized the traditional pay-as-you-go financing of Social Security, saying: "Americans have got to understand that we are paying present-day retirees with the taxes paid by young workers in America today.

McCain has not offered a specific plan to address the possible Social Security shortfall, but has stated that although he prefers not to raise taxes, all options, including payroll tax increases, are "on the table". <ref>{{cite web| last = Rebori | first = Anamarie | title = McCain: Social Security Tax Hike ‘On the Table’ | publisher=[[ABC News]]| date = July 27, 2008| url = http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/07/mccain-social-s.html| accessdate =July 28, 2008}}</ref> . 

===Subprime mortgage crisis===. 
Regarding the [[subprime mortgage crisis]], McCain said its root cause was loose credit and greed. On January 31, 2008, he said, "I think there are some greedy people on Wall Street that perhaps need to be punished." He also praised the [[George W. Bush administration]]'s handling of the crisis. <ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=agXkOAx_uQb0&refer=home McCain, Romney Clash Anew in Last Debate Before Feb. 5 Votes] Bloomberg.com, Jan. 31, 2008</ref> McCain later addressed the situation in a speech:
<blockquote>I will not play election year politics with the housing crisis. I will evaluate everything in terms of whether it might be harmful or helpful to our effort to deal with the crisis we face now.  . 

I have always been committed to the principle that it is not the duty of government to bail out and reward those who act irresponsibly, whether they are big banks or small borrowers. Government assistance to the banking system should be based solely on preventing [[systemic risk]] that would endanger the entire financial system and the economy. </blockquote> . 

McCain went on to say he would entertain the thought to only give temporary assistance to homeowners for their primary homes, but not to others who owned homes to rent out nor to speculators. He also proposed that mortgage lenders do more to help the economy by helping their customers. He suggested an approach that [[General Motors]] did after the [[attacks of September 11, 2001]] when they reduced interest rates for their customers. "We need a similar response by the mortgage lenders. They've been asking the government to help them out. I'm now calling upon them to help their customers, and their nation out. It's time to help American families."<ref>{{cite news

McCain's speech on the Senate floor during debate of Federal Housing Regulatory Act Of 2005: . 

<blockquote>
“OFHEO’s report solidifies my view that the GSEs need to be reformed without delay. I join as a cosponsor of the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005, S. 190, to underscore my support for quick passage of GSE regulatory reform legislation. If Congress does not act, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system, and the economy as a whole.”</blockquote> . 

S.190 was a bill to address the regulation of secondary mortgage market enterprises, and for other purposes. introduced January 2005 McCain was a co-sponsor. <ref>http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:SN00190:@@@P</ref><ref>http://www.theminorityreportblog.com/blog_entry/ken_taylor/2008/09/17/john_mccain_warned_of_mortgage_collapse_in_2005</ref> . 

As of mid-September 2008, McCain had not introduced any banking or housing bills in the 110th Congress, which began in January 2007. <ref>{{cite news| title=McCain has not sponsored a banking bill this Congress |author=Bob Cusack |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=September 25, 2008 |url=http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/mccain-has-introduced-no-banking-bill-this-congress-2008-09-25.html }}</ref> . 

In October 2008, McCain proposed that the federal government buy troubled mortgages, and provide low-interest mortgages to qualified homeowners.  For people with [[401(k)]] plans, he wanted to allow more flexibility about when money can be withdrawn, and would lower the tax on that money, as well as lowering the tax on [[unemployment insurance]] benefits.  McCain also proposed to cut the [[capital gains tax]] on stock held for more than one year, while increasing the tax write-off for stock losses. <ref>Douglas, William and Talev, Margaret.

===Financial deregulation===. 
In 1999, McCain voted for the [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]], which passed in the Senate by a vote of 54–44. <ref>[http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=106&session=1&vote=00105 Senate roll call vote on S.900, May 6, 1999]</ref>  The deregulation bill loosened restrictions on the activities of banks, brokerage houses, and insurance companies.

In 2008, McCain expressed approval of the results of financial deregulation by pointing to it as a model for health care policy, writing: "Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation."<ref>{{Cite news| last = McCain| first = John| author-link = John McCain| title = Better Care at Lower Cost for Every American| newspaper=[[Contingencies]]| pages = 29–31| date = September/October 2008 | url = http://www.contingencies.org/septoct08/mccain.pdf| postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> . 

Later in 2008, in the wake of the widely publicized crises involving the insurance company [[American International Group]] and the brokerage houses [[Lehman Brothers]] and [[Merrill Lynch]], McCain stated: "In my administration, we're going to hold people on [[Wall Street]] responsible. And we're going to enact and enforce reforms to make sure that these outrages never happen in the first place."<ref name="embraces"/>  . 

In 2009, McCain temporarily expressed support for reinstating the [[Glass-Steagall Act of 1932|Glass-Steagall Act]] that he had voted to repeal in order to respond to banking regulation failures in the [[Financial Crisis 2008|Financial Crisis]], though he also ultimately voted against the Obama Administration-backed [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]].  .

We do not believe in coercion and the use of state power to mandate care, coverage or costs."<ref name="wapo102007"/> . 

On April 29, 2008, McCain detailed his health care plan in the context of his campaign for President. His plan focused on open-market competition rather than government funding or control. At the heart of his plan are tax credits – $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families who do not subscribe to or do not have access to health care through their employer. He says the money could be used to purchase insurance and force insurance companies to be competitive with their costs in order to attract consumers. <ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/apr2008/db20080429_854428.htm McCain's Health Care Proposal] BusinessWeek.com, April 29, 2008</ref> To help people who are denied coverage by insurance companies due to pre-existing conditions, McCain would work with states to create what he calls a "Guaranteed Access Plan".

===Native American affairs===. 
As a member of the House, McCain sponsored a number of Indian Affairs bills, dealing mainly with giving distribution of lands to reservations and tribal tax status; most of these bills were unsuccessful. <ref>{{cite book |title = Man of the People: The Life of John McCain |first = Paul |last = Alexander |authorlink=Paul Alexander (American writer) |isbn = 0-471-22829-X |year = 2002 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]}} pp. 98–99. </ref>  He then got the Indian Economic Development Act of 1985 signed into law. <ref>Alexander, ''Man of the People'', p. 104. </ref> . 

As a senator, McCain often supported the Native American agenda, advocating self-governance and sovereignty and tribe control of adoptions.

===Veterans benefits===. 
{{see also|Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008}}
McCain initially opposed the [[Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008|Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act]], introduced by Senator [[Jim Webb]], which provides college-tuition benefits for veterans in a manner similar to that of the original [[Servicemen's Readjustment Act (USA)|G.I.

In early June 2008, the White House signaled the president might be willing to sign a modified version of the Webb bill, along with the war funding bill, if transferability between spouses and dependents was added onto the new GI Bill. This would make the benefits more valuable to career military personal that would like to pay for their spouse or child's education. <ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2008-06-04-gi-bill_N.htm | title=White House pushes GI Bill compromise on Iraq bill |work=USA Today | date=June 4, 2008 | accessdate=June 30, 2008}}</ref>  On June 19, this provision was added to the war funding bill.

In March 2008, McCain said that the United States should "strengthen our global alliances as the core of a new global compact – a League of Democracies – that can harness the vast influence of the more than one hundred democratic nations around the world to advance our values and defend our shared interests." He said that the United States did not single-handedly win the [[Cold War]], but rather the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]] alliance did so, "in concert with partners around the world."<ref>{{cite news

{{main|Arab-Israeli conflict}}
In a speech to [[AIPAC]] on April 23, 2002, McCain said that "no American leader should be expected to sell a false peace to our ally, consider Israel's right to self-defense less legitimate than ours, or insist that Israel negotiate a political settlement while terrorism remains the Palestinians' preferred bargaining tool."<ref>John McCain, [http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=105001979 "United in Freedom: America must stand with Israel against Arab tyranny and terror"], ''The Wall Street Journal'', April 26, 2002</ref> During the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]], McCain said, regarding Israel's role in the conflict with Lebanon and [[Hezbollah]], "What would we do if somebody came across our borders and killed our soldiers and captured our soldiers? Do you think we would be exercising total restraint?"<ref>[http://www.azstarnet.com/news/138072 "McCain: Israel's response is appropriate"], ''Associated Press'', July 16, 2006</ref> . 

McCain has called for the release of convicted Israeli spy [[Jonathan Pollard]], currently serving a life sentence for passing U.S. secrets to Israel. <ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/9539835 Sen. McCain calls for release of Israeli spy], ''[[The Guardian]]'' (March 11, 2011)</ref> . 

====Israeli-Syrian conflict====. 
During the 2008 presidential campaign, McCain's advisors stated that they were not in favor of the peace negotiations then ongoing between Israel and Syria. <ref name="jta.org">[http://www.jewishjournal.com/elections/article/mccain_advisors_no_to_syria_talks_little_interest_in_middle_east_peace_proc/ McCain advisors: No to Syria talks, little interest in Middle East peace process]</ref> . 

====Israeli-Palestinian conflict====. 
{{main|Israeli-Palestinian conflict}}
It is unclear whether or not McCain supports the [[two-state solution]] to the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], although McCain has courted the support of individuals and groups that are opposed to the creation of a [[Palestinian state]]. <ref>[http://www.jstreet.org/campaigns/does-john-mccain-support-a-two-state-solution Does John McCain support a two-state solution?], [[J Street]]</ref> . 

In 2008, McCain's advisors stated that they did not favor continuing the [[Peace process in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict|peace process]] between Israel and the Palestinians. <ref name="jta.org"/> . 

===Detention and torture of extrajudicial prisoners===. 
:''For further details on this topic, see [[McCain Detainee Amendment]] and [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]]''
In October 2005, McCain, a former [[POW]], introduced an amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill for 2005. That month, the U.S. Senate voted 90–9 to support the amendment. <ref>{{cite web | title = Roll Call Votes 109th Congress – 1st Session on the Amendment (McCain Amdt. No. 1977) | work=[[United States Senate]]|date = October 5, 2005 | url = http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=1&vote=00249 | accessdate =August 15, 2006 }}</ref>  The amendment was commonly referred to as the ''Amendment on (1) the Army Field Manual and (2) Cruel, Inhumane, Degrading Treatment, amendment #1977'' and also known as the McCain Amendment 1977.  It became the [[Detainee Treatment Act of 2005]] as Title X of the Department of Defense Authorization bill.  The amendment prohibits inhumane treatment of prisoners, including prisoners at [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp|Guantanamo Bay]], by confining interrogations to the techniques in [[FM 34-52 Intelligence Interrogation|Army Field Manual 34–52, "Intelligence Interrogation"]].  . 

On December 15, 2005, Bush announced that he accepted McCain's terms and will "make it clear to the world that this government does not torture and that we adhere to the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|international convention of torture]], whether it be here at home or abroad."<ref>{{cite news | url =  http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/12/15/torture.bill/ | title =  McCain, Bush agree on torture ban |publisher=CNN | date = December 15, 2005 | accessdate =August 16, 2006 }}</ref>  Bush made clear his interpretation of this legislation on December 30, 2005, in a [[Signing statement#Controversy over George W.

McCain argues that American military and intelligence personnel in future wars will suffer for abuses committed in 2006 by the US in the name of fighting terrorism. He fears the administration's policy will put American prisoners at risk of torture, summary executions and other atrocities by chipping away at [[Geneva Conventions]].  He argues that his rival bill to Bush’s plan gives defendants access to classified evidence being used to convict them and will set tight limits on use of testimony obtained by coercion. Furthermore it offers CIA interrogators some legal protections from charges of abuse, but rejects the administration’s plan to more narrowly define the Geneva Conventions’ standards for humane treatment of prisoners. McCain insists this issue overrides politics.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}   . 

McCain, whose six years of captivity and [[torture]] in Vietnam made him a national celebrity, negotiated (in September 2006) a compromise in the Senate for the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]], suspending [[habeas corpus]] provisions for anyone deemed by the Executive Branch an "unlawful enemy combatant" and barring them from challenging their detentions in court.  Coming on the heels of a Supreme Court decision adverse to the White House, McCain's compromise gave a retroactive, nine-year immunity to U.S. officials who authorized, ordered, or committed acts of torture and abuse, and permitted the use of statements obtained through torture to be used in military tribunals so long as the abuse took place by December 30, 2005. <ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0609290178sep29,1,1387725.story | title = Tribunal bill OKd by Senate |work=Chicago Tribune | author=William Neikirk, Andrew Zajac, Mark Silva|date = September 29, 2006 | accessdate =September 29, 2006 }}</ref>
McCain's compromise permitted the President to establish permissible interrogation techniques and to "interpret the meaning and application" of international [[Geneva Convention]] standards, so long as the coercion fell short of "serious" bodily or psychological injury. <ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/29/washington/29detain.html  | title = Senate Passes Broad New Detainee Rules |work=The New York Times | date = September 28, 2006 | accessdate =September 28, 2006 | first=Kate | last=Zernike}}</ref> Widely dubbed McCain's "torture compromise", the bill was signed into law by George W. Bush on October 17, 2006, shortly before the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]].  . 

McCain said in March 2007 that he would "immediately close [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp|Guantanamo Bay]], move all the prisoners to [[Fort Leavenworth]] and truly expedite the judicial proceedings in their cases". <ref>{{cite news |first=Philip |last=Sherwell |title=Straight-talking McCain vows to fix world's view of the 'ugly American' |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/03/18/wus18.xml |publisher=[[Sunday Telegraph]] |date=March 19, 2007 |accessdate=February 7, 2008 | location=London}}</ref> On September 19, 2007, he voted against restoring habeas corpus to detainees. <ref>[http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=1&vote=00340 U.S. Senate: Legislation & Records Home – Votes – Roll Call Vote]</ref> . 

In October 2007, McCain said of [[waterboarding]] that, "They [other presidential candidates] should know what it is. It is not a complicated procedure. It is torture."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/26/us/politics/26giuliani.html|title=McCain Rebukes Giuliani on Waterboarding Remark|work=New York Times|date=October 26, 2007|accessdate=March 8, 2008 | first1=Michael | last1=Cooper | first2=Marc | last2=Santora}}</ref> In February 2008 he voted against HR 2082, the [[Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008]], which included provisions that would have prevented the CIA from waterboarding prisoners. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=2&vote=00022|title=On the Conference Report (HR 2082 Conference Report)|publisher=United States Senate|date=February 13, 2008|accessdate=March 8, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/13/washington/13cnd-cong.html?hp|title=Senate Passes Interrogation Ban|work=New York Times|date=February 13, 2008|accessdate=March 8, 2008 | first=David M. | last=Herszenhorn}}</ref>  The bill in question contained other provisions to which McCain objected, and his spokesman stated: "This wasn't a vote on waterboarding.

===Iran===. 
John McCain has called the [[Nuclear program of Iran|crisis with Iran]] "the most serious crisis we have faced – outside of the entire [[war on terror]] – since the end of the [[Cold War]]."  "Nuclear capability in Iran is unacceptable," said McCain. McCain has criticized Russia and China for causing "gridlock" in the [[UN Security Council]] and preventing the sanctioning of Iran as well as other areas of conflict such as [[Darfur]] and [[Burma]]. If elected, McCain pledges to create a "league of democracies" with the purpose of addressing those conflicts without the approval of China and Russia. <ref>[http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/1/22/124748.shtml John McCain: Iran Crisis Most Serious Since Cold War]</ref><ref>[http://www.johnmccain.com/informing/news/Speeches/43e821a2-ad70-495a-83b2-098638e67aeb.htm Senator McCain Addresses The Hoover Institution on U.S. Foreign Policy]</ref> . 

McCain has cited [[Iran-Israel relations|Iran's stance towards Israel]] as justification for his aggressive policy towards Iran, saying, "Iran is dedicated to the destruction of Israel. That alone should concern us but now they are trying for nuclear capabilities. I totally support the president when he says we will not allow Iran to destroy Israel."<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,267041,00.html McCain Revives Song Parody to Make Point on Iran]</ref> . 

Regarding military action against Iran, McCain has said, "I pray every night that we will avoid a conflict with Iran." He has also said, "There's a whole lot of things we can do before we seriously consider the military option," but clarifying, "I still say there's only one thing worse than [[Support for military action against Iran|military action against Iran]] and that is a nuclear-armed Iran." His [[Cultural and political image of John McCain#Controversial remarks|comments]] regarding "bombing Iran" made to veterans in South Carolina have come under scrutiny, despite McCain's statement that the comments were made in jest. <ref name="CBSBombIran">[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/04/20/politics/main2709937.shtml McCain's "Bomb Iran" Joke Draws Fire]</ref> . 

McCain tried to persuade [[FIFA]] to ban Iran from the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], referring to Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad|Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's]] [[Holocaust Denial|Holocaust denials]] as the reason since such denials in Germany, where the competition was held, are illegal. <ref>[http://mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressOffice.PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=83C12174-F3C8-45F4-A964-01E51B5AF7ED McCain Introduces Resolution Calling on FIFA to Ban Iran from World Cup]</ref> . 

In June 2008, a group of congressional [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] criticized McCain for voting against 2005 legislation that would have toughened [[sanctions against Iran]]. "McCain tries to give the impression that he's tough on Iran, but when it came time to stand up to party leaders and [[Big Oil]], John McCain stood down," said senator [[Frank Lautenberg]]. <ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jun/26/johnmccain.barackobama US elections: Congressional Democrats attack John McCain on Iran sanctions], guardian.co.uk</ref> .

In April 2004, McCain was asked by [[Peter George Peterson|Peter G.

McCain responded, "I think it's obvious that we would have to leave because— if it was an elected government of Iraq...."<ref>{{cite web  | title = Iraq: The Test of a Generation | publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]| date = April 22, 2004| url = http://www.cfr.org/publication/6973/  | accessdate =July 18, 2008}}</ref> .

In November 2005 McCain said in a speech that the U.S. government must do more to keep public support high for the war, and that more troops were needed, as well as a number of other changes in the U.S. approach to the war. He concluded his speech by saying that "America, Iraq and the world are better off with Saddam Hussein in prison rather than in power…and we must honor their sacrifice by seeing this mission through to victory."<ref>{{cite web | title = Winning the War in Iraq | author=McCain, John (speech) | url= http://mccain.senate.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=NewsCenter.ViewSpeech&Content_id=1622  |date= November 10, 2005 | accessdate =August 15, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051230222508/http://mccain.senate.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=NewsCenter.ViewSpeech&Content_id=1622 |archivedate = December 30, 2005}}</ref>  . 

In October 2006, McCain said that he had "no confidence" in then-[[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]], but was not calling for his resignation at that time, saying that "the president picks his team, and the president has the right to stay with that team if he wants to."<ref>{{cite news | title = Hardball's College Tour with John McCain | date = October 19, 2006 | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15330717/|publisher=[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]] | accessdate =October 24, 2006 }}</ref> . 

On January 10, 2007, Bush announced the commitment of more than 20,000 additional troops as a part of the [[Iraqi troop surge of 2007]]. McCain was a leading advocate for the move, leading some Democrats to call the policy the "McCain Doctrine". Days after the announcement, McCain appeared on CBS' ''[[Face the Nation]]'' and said, "This is a chance under the new leadership of General Petraeus and Admiral Fallon to have a chance to succeed.

In November 2007, on the [[Charlie Rose]] show on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], Rose asked if South Korea might be an analogy of where Iraq might be, in terms of an American presence, over the next 20 to 25 years. McCain replied that he didn't think so – even if there were no (ongoing) casualties, saying "I can see an American presence for a while. But eventually I think because of the nature of the society in Iraq and the religious aspects of it that America eventually withdraws. <ref>[http://thinkprogress.org/2007/11/28/mccain-korea-withdrawal/ McCain on the Charlie Rose show (video clip), November 27, 2007], with partial transcript at thinkprogress.org, retrieved April 30, 2008</ref>  . 

On January 3, 2008 at a campaign stop in [[Derry, New Hampshire]], when a questioner said, "President Bush has talked about our staying in Iraq for 50 years," McCain responded:
<blockquote>"Make it a hundred. We've been in Japan for 60 years, we've been in South Korea for 50 years or so. That'd be fine with me as long as Americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed. That's fine with me.

The Iraq War has been won….Iraq is a functioning democracy, although still suffering from the lingering effects of decades of tyranny and centuries of sectarian tension.

In a June 11, 2008 interview on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC Program)|Today Show]]'', McCain was asked whether, in light of recent progress from the [[Iraq surge|troop surge]] in Iraq, he had a clearer idea of when U.S. troops could begin withdrawing.

In October 2005, McCain said “Afghanistan, we don’t read about anymore, because it’s succeeded. And by the way, there’s several reasons, including NATO participation and other reasons, why Afghanistan is doing as well as it is.”<ref>''The Charlie Rose Show'', [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], October 31, 2005 ([http://mediamatters.org/items/200803310001 transcript])</ref> . 

In December 2006, asked if the U.S. would send more troops to Afghanistan, McCain said, "The British have said that they will be sending additional troops, taking troops out of Iraq and into Afghanistan. If it's necessary, we will, and I'm sure we would be agreeable, but the focus here is more on training the Afghan National Army and the police, as opposed to the increased U.S. troop presence."<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/16/asia/AS_GEN_Afghan_US.php "U.S. Sen.

In July 2008, McCain said that reducing U.S. forces in Iraq would free up troops for Afghanistan, where "at least" three additional brigades, or about 15,000 troops, must be sent. A campaign aide said later that McCain's proposal included a combination of both U.S. and NATO forces. <ref>Paul West,[http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation/politics/bal-te.campaign16jul16,0,3010442.story "Emphasis shifts to Afghanistan: McCain follows Obama by day, proposes an increase of as many as 15,000 allied forces"], ''Baltimore Sun'', July 16, 2008</ref> . 

===Libya===. 
On August 14, 2009, McCain, along with Senators [[Joe Lieberman]] and [[Lindsey Graham]], met with [[Libya]]n leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] in [[Tripoli]] "to talk . . . about a transfer of American military equipment."<ref name=SalonLibya>Elliott, Justin (2011-03-22) [http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/03/22/mccain_gadhafi_wikileaks/index.html McCain was for Gadhafi before he was against him], ''[[Salon.com]]''</ref> At the meeting, Gaddafi's son Muatassim  "emphasized Libya's interest in the purchase of U.S. lethal and non-lethal military equipment," and McCain "assured Muatassim that the United States wanted to provide Libya with the equipment it needs."<ref name=SalonLibya/> Following the meeting, McCain sent out a [[Twitter|tweet]] declaring that he had spent "an interesting evening with an interesting man."<ref name=SalonLibya/> A year and a half later, during the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], McCain called for the removal of Gaddafi from power, due to Gaddafi having "'American blood on his hands' from the [[Pan Am Flight 103|1988 Lockerbie bombing]]."<ref name=SalonLibya/> In April 2011, he became the 'highest-profile Western politician' to visit the rebels in Libya, urging Washington to consider a ground attack that aims for the absolute removal of Gaddafi.

===Kosovo===. 
"It is time to bring [[Kosovo]] – and the [[Balkans]] with it – out of the 1990s and into the 21st century by recognizing [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|Kosovo's independence]]. Eleven years ago, that region was in flames, characterized by [[ethnic cleansing]] and widespread violence. For the first time the region is today poised to move forward, with final status for Kosovo and transitioning continuing responsibilities there to increasing European control – at long last closing the door on the region's painful past," stated McCain at the Munich Security Conference in February 2008. <ref>[http://www.serbianna.com/news/2008/01279.shtml McCain calls for Kosovo independence at Munich Conference ]</ref> During the crisis in the Serbian breakaway province of Kosovo in 1999, McCain urged President Clinton to use all necessary force. <ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-03-25-mccainforce_N.htm McCain: Life shaped judgment on use of force], USATODAY.com, March 3, 2008</ref> . 

===North Korea===. 
In October 2006, McCain said that he believed the former President [[Bill Clinton]] and his administration were to blame for the [[North Korean nuclear crisis|North Korea's weapons of mass destruction]]. He said that the U.S. had "concluded an unenforceable and untransparent agreement", allowing [[North Korea]] to keep plutonium rods in a reactor. <ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Story?id=2552913&page=1 "John McCain Criticizes Clintons on North Korea: Senator Says Diplomacy Should Be Used As First Resort"], ''ABC News'', October 11, 2006</ref> In an article he wrote for the November/December 2007 issue of ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', he referred to North Korea as a "totalitarian regime," and said that it was necessary for North Korea be committed to "verifiable denuclearization" and "full accounting of all its nuclear materials and facilities" before any "lasting diplomatic agreement can be reached."<ref>[http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20071101faessay86602-p30/john-mccain/an-enduring-peace-built-on-freedom.html "An Enduring Peace Built on Freedom"], ''Foreign Affairs'' magazine, November/December 2007</ref> . 

In a 2003 interview with PBS' Frontline he called the Clinton policy towards North Korea "appeasement" and said the U.S. should've attacked North Korea in the Clinton years to prevent a nuclear capability.  . 

"<ref>http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/kim/etc/script.html</ref> MARTIN SMITH: You called Clinton an appeaser.  . 

Sen. JOHN McCAIN: Well, you know, if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, it's appeasement.  . 

MARTIN SMITH: So what was the alternative? . 

Sen. JOHN McCAIN: The alternative was to say, "You stop this development of nuclear weapons, or we exercise every option we have," not excluding the military option, sanctions, conversations with the Japanese, the Chinese, the South Koreans, the Russians. Exercise every option. Don't engage in bribery, which is what it was. It was bribery.  . 

MARTIN SMITH: But in retrospect, they would have 50, 60 bombs by now, and they don't.  . 

Sen. JOHN McCAIN: In retrospect—in retrospect, if they hadn't stopped doing it, we would have acted militarily. And we wouldn't be facing the magnitude of the threat that we're facing now." . 

===Nuclear weapons===. 
McCain voted in favor of the [[Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction]] in 1991. <ref>[http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=102&session=1&vote=00274 U.S. Senate: Legislation & Records Home – Votes – Roll Call Vote]</ref>  He voted to ratify the [[START II]] strategic arms limitation treaty in 1996. <ref>[http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_member.php?cs_id=V788 Project Vote Smart – The START II Treaty Member Vote List<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> .

In March 2008, McCain said that United States should reduce its [[nuclear weapons|nuclear arsenal]] to encourage other nations to reduce their arsenals: . 

<blockquote>"Forty years ago, the five declared nuclear powers came together in support of the [[Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty]] and pledged to end the arms race and move toward nuclear disarmament. The time has come to renew that commitment. We do not need all the weapons currently in our arsenal. The United States should lead a global effort at nuclear disarmament consistent with our vital interests and the cause of peace."<ref>{{cite news

===Pakistan===. 
McCain maintains a relatively moderate stance concerning [[Pakistan]], although he has recognized the South Asian nation as an important part of US Foreign Policy. In the aftermath of Pakistan's former Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]]'s assassination (in December 2007) McCain appeared to rule out the option of US forces entering Pakistan, saying that it was not an appropriate time to "threaten" Pakistan. <ref>[http://www.thehawkeye.com/Story/vote_mcCain_122907 McCain Points to His Experience] The Hawkeye.com, Dec. 29, 2007</ref> . 

===Russia===. 
McCain has been one of the foremost Senate critics of [[Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]]: "I looked into his eyes and saw three letters: [[KGB|a K, a G and a B]]", referring to Putin's membership in the KGB during the Soviet era. He has said that Putin is "going to cause a lot of difficulties" and that he is "trying to reassert the [[Russian empire]]."<ref>Michael Goldfarb, [http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2007/12/mccain_man_of_the_year_should.asp McCain: Man of the Year Should Have Been Petraeus] Weekly Standard.com, Dec. 19, 2007</ref>  In January 2007, McCain said that he thought Putin was using Russia's energy sources as a political weapon. <ref>Marc Champion, [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB117002272528890503.html?mod=googlenews_wsj Gazprom Goes on the Offensive] Wall Street Journal, Jan. 29, 2007</ref> . 

{{cquote|He bullies his neighbors and he wants to get a control of the [[Energy policy of Russia|energy supply of Western Europe]]. This is a dangerous person.

McCain was a fierce opponent of Putin's [[2nd Chechen War|Invasion of Chechnya]] describing it as "a bloody war against [[Chechnya]]'s civilian population." He stated "Yes, there are Chechen terrorists, but there are many Chechens who took up arms only after the atrocities committed by Russian forces serving first under Boris Yeltsin's and then Putin's orders." Like others, he disputes that the [[Russian apartment bombings]] had  anything to do with [[Chechen people|Chechens]], and that instead "There remain credible allegations that Russia's FSB had a hand in carrying out these attacks". He also blamed Russia's security services for political assassinations as well as the [[List of journalists killed in Russia|assassinations of independent journalists]]. <ref>http://www.friendsofmccain.com/news/dspnews.cfm?id=81 McCain Decries ''November 4, 2003''</ref> . 

{{cquote|Meanwhile, the FSB has been unable to solve the murder of leading independent journalists. It has failed to bring to justice any suspects in the murder of democratic politicians.

What brave men they must be to kick down the doors of a private airplane and arrest an unarmed man.}} . 

In 2005 McCain and Connecticut senator [[Joseph Lieberman]] brought a draft resolution with the requirement to suspend membership of Russia in the [[G8]], an international forum. The same year he initiated Senate acceptance of a resolution charging the Russian government with "political motivations" in litigation concerning [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]] and [[Platon Lebedev]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} In October 2007, McCain again called for removal of Russia from the G8: . 

{{cquote|Today, we see in Russia diminishing political freedoms, a leadership dominated by a clique of former intelligence officers, efforts to bully democratic neighbors, such as [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and attempts to manipulate Europe's dependence on Russian oil and gas.

In 2008 McCain accused Russian leader [[Vladimir Putin]] of clear aspirations of wanting to restore the [[Russian empire|czarist empire]]. McCain stated that Putin is still running Russia, saying he is "still by far the most powerful and influential person in Russia," and that "It's very clear that Russian ambitions are to restore the old Russian Empire.

===Georgia and South Ossetia War===. 
During the [[2008 South Ossetia war]], McCain reacted strongly to [[Russia]]’s widening assault against [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. McCain said Europe and other nations must be united against such acts, and proclaimed support for the U.S.’s closest ally among the democratizing former Soviet republics. He also pointed out that NATO should reconsider its decision to deny Georgia the fast track for [[NATO]] membership. That decision “might have been viewed as a green light by Russia for its attacks on Georgia,” McCain said. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/08/11/mccain-defends-georgia-in-face-of-russian-attacks/ | work=Fox News | title=Elections | date=January 21, 2012}}</ref>  . 

McCain also stated that Americans are supporting the "brave little nation" of Georgia against Russia's military attacks. <ref name="McCain supports Georgia"/> McCain spoke with President [[Mikhail Saakashvili]] of Georgia, and told him "I know I speak for every American when I say, 'Today, we are all Georgians.'"<ref name="McCain supports Georgia"/>  "Russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign Georgian territory.

===Czech Republic===. 
On July 14, 2008, McCain expressed concern about [[Russia]]'s reducing the [[Energy policy of Russia|energy supplies]] to [[Czech Republic]]: "I was concerned about a couple of steps that the Russian government took in the last several days. One was reducing the energy supplies to [[Czechoslovakia]]<sup>[sic]</sup>. Apparently that is in reaction to the Czech’s agreement with us concerning [[National missile defense|missile defense]], and again some of the Russian now announcement they are now retargeting new targets, something they abandoned at the end of the Cold War, is also a concern."<ref>[http://thepage.time.com/transcript-of-mccains-remarks-to-the-press-in-phoenix/ Transcript of McCain’s Remarks to the Press in Phoenix], TIME</ref> . 

===Cuba===. 
When McCain was running for president in 2000, he supported the normalizing of relations with [[Cuba]], even if [[Fidel Castro]] remained in power, provided that the Cuban government did certain things to democratize Cuba. McCain compared the situation to normalizing relations with Vietnam. <ref>Michael Luo, [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/21/us/politics/21mccain.html?fta=y "Cuba Is Topic as McCain Continues Attack on Obama"], ''New York Times'', May 21, 2008</ref> . 

===Ukraine===. 
According to the ''JohnMcCain.com'': "There is disturbing evidence Russia is already laying the groundwork to apply the same arguments used to justify its [[2008 South Ossetia war|intervention in Georgia]] to other parts of its near abroad – most ominously in [[Crimea]]. This strategically important peninsula is part of [[Ukraine]], but with a large [[Russians|ethnic Russian]] population and the headquarters of Russia's [[Black Sea Fleet]] at [[Sevastopol]]."<ref>[http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/News/PressReleases/0e23c988-29a8-428a-b6a9-4a9eb3c8c8f5.htm McCain-Palin 2008], JohnMcCain.com</ref> "Now, I think the Russians ought to understand that we will support – we, the United States – will support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in the natural process, inclusion into [[NATO]]""And watch Ukraine.

===Egyptian Demonstrations=== . 

John McCain tweeted "Regrettably the time has come for President Mubarak to step down and relinquish power. It's in the best interest of Egypt, its people and its military."
The following morning in an interview with Good Morning America he said the following on Egypt "This virus spreading throughout the Middle East proves the universality of human yearnings, and probably the only place where you won't see these demonstrations is Iraq."<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/US/egypt-violence-prompts-mccainto-call-mubarak-step-agree/story?id=12830499] ABC NEWS Feb 3, 2011 McCain Calls for Mubarak To Step Down http://abcnews.go.com/US/egypt-violence-prompts-mccainto-call-mubarak-step-agree/story?id=12830499</ref>  He also said on Fox News to Gretta Van Susteren "This virus is spreading throughout the Middle East. The president of Yemen, as you know, just made the announcement that he wasn’t running again.

==Structure of government==. 
===Judicial appointments===. 
McCain is a believer in judges who would, as he sees it, "strictly interpret the Constitution,"<ref name="msn042607"/> and is against what he sees as “the systemic abuse of our federal courts" by judges who “preemptively" decide American social policy. <ref name="nyt050608">{{cite news | url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/mccain-criticizes-democratic-rivals-on-activist-judges/ | title=McCain Criticizes Democratic Rivals on ‘Activist’ Judges | author=[[Elisabeth Bumiller]] | work=The New York Times | date=May 6, 2008 | accessdate=June 9, 2008}}</ref> .

===Gang of 14 and Senate filibuster===. 
{{main|Gang of 14}}
On May 23, 2005, McCain led fourteen Senators to forge a compromise on the Democrats' use of the judicial [[filibuster]], thus eliminating the need for the Republican leadership's attempt to implement the so-called "[[nuclear option]]" (also known as the "constitutional option"). Under the agreement, Senators would retain the power to filibuster a judicial nominee, the Democrats would agree to use this power against Bush nominees only in an "extraordinary circumstance", the Republicans involved would agree to vote against the nuclear option if implemented, and three of the most contested Bush [[appellate court]] nominees ([[Janice Rogers Brown]], [[Priscilla Owen]] and [[William H. Pryor, Jr.|William Pryor]]) would receive a vote by the full Senate. The agreement may have affected the likelihood that a Senate minority would defeat subsequent nominations to the U.S. Supreme Court (e.g. the nominations of [[John Roberts]] and [[Samuel Alito]]). Such a defeat by a filibustering Senate minority could have become ''less likely'' if the so-called "nuclear option" had been successful, but such a defeat could have become ''more likely'' if the nuclear option had been voted down. <ref>Charles Willis Pickering, [http://books.google.com/books?id=J2V0spw1YNQC&pg=PA164&lpg=PA164&dq=%22constitutional+option+failed%22&source=web&ots=jhJ2tMDzYI&sig=xnlzhbh_iwQXndeRO3A4FU6r1QQ#PPA164,M1 Supreme Chaos: The Politics of Judicial Confirmation & the Culture War], page 164 (2006).

===Religion and the nation===. 
On February 28, 2000, during [[John McCain presidential campaign, 2000|his presidential primary campaign]], McCain sharply criticized leaders of the [[Christian right|religious right]] as "agents of intolerance" allied to his rival, Governor George W. Bush, and denounced what he said were the tactics of "division and slander." McCain singled out the evangelists [[Pat Robertson]] and [[Jerry Falwell]] as "corrupting influences on religion and politics" and said parts of the religious right were divisive. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904EFDE1239F93AA15751C0A9669C8B63 |title=Excerpt From McCain's Speech on Religious Conservatives |work=The New York Times |date=February 29, 2000 |accessdate=December 30, 2007}}</ref><ref name="nyt101907">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/us/politics/19mccain.html |title=Confronting Ghosts of 2000 in South Carolina |author=Jennifer Steinhauer |work=The New York Times |date=October 19, 2007 |accessdate=January 7, 2008}}</ref> . 

In an interview in March 2007, [[David Brody (correspondent)|David Brody]] for CBN news asked McCain about these comments, "Do you regret saying it?

It's over."<ref>[http://www.cbn.com/CBNnews/122005.aspx McCain Says He Needs Evangelicals To Win]</ref> . 

When interviewed in 2007 by [[Beliefnet]], a website that covers religious affairs, McCain was asked if he thought a non-Christian should be president of the United States. He answered, "I just have to say in all candor that since this nation was founded primarily on Christian principles, personally, I prefer someone who has a grounding in my faith." McCain also stated his agreement with the belief that the U.S. is a "Christian nation." On September 30, 2007, he clarified his remarks by saying "What I do mean to say is the United States of America was founded on the values of Judeo-Christian values, which were translated by our founding fathers which is basically the rights of human dignity and human rights."<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/10/01/mccain.christian.nation/index.html "Groups criticize McCain for calling U.S. 'Christian nation'"] CNN.com, October 1, 2007</ref>  McCain also stated, “I would vote for a Muslim if he or she was the candidate best able to lead the country and defend our political values.”<ref>[http://www.beliefnet.com/story/220/story_22001_1.html John McCain: Constitution Established a 'Christian Nation']</ref> . 

===Campaign finance regulation===. 
An advocate of government restrictions on campaign spending and contributions, McCain made [[campaign finance reform]] a central issue in his 2000 presidential bid. With Democratic Sen.

In May 2008, McCain stated his intention, if elected, to create a Presidential equivalent of the British conditional convention of [[Prime Minister's Questions]]. <ref>{{cite news |title=If Presidents Faced Question Time |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/01/opinion/01sun3.html |work=New York Times |work=The New York Times  |date=June 1, 2008 |accessdate=June 1, 2008 }}</ref> In a policy speech on May 15 which outlined a number of ideas, McCain said, "I will ask [[United States Congress|Congress]] to grant me the privilege of coming before both houses to take questions, and address criticism, much the same as the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister of Great Britain]] {{sic}} appears regularly before the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]."<ref>{{cite news |author=[[John McCain]] |title=Text of McCain's Speech on First-Term Goals |url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/05/15/text_of_mccains_vision_of_2013.html |work=The Washington Post  |date=May 15, 2008 |accessdate=June 1, 2008| quote= ''I will ask Congress to grant me the privilege of coming before both houses to take questions, and address criticism, much the same as the prime minister of Great Britain appears regularly before the House of Commons''.}}</ref> . 

[[George F. Will]] of the ''[[The Washington Post]]'' criticized the proposal in an [[Op-Ed]] piece, saying that a Presidential Question Time would endanger [[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution|separation of powers]] as the President of the United States, unlike the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], is not a member of the legislature. Will ended the piece by saying, "Congress should remind a President McCain that the 16 blocks separating [[United States Capitol|the Capitol]] from the [[White House]] nicely express the nation's constitutional geography."<ref>{{cite news |author=[[George F. Will]] |title= McCain's Question Time|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/28/AR2008052802917.html |work=The Washington Post |work=The Washington Post  |date=May 28, 2008 |accessdate=June 1, 2008 }}</ref> However, critics of Will's review, such as Steven Spadijer point out that Question Time would be a check and balance in and of itself:  . 

{{quotation|If one is to take Will's logic to its ultimate conclusion, why don't we cancel the State of the Union Address altogether? Congressional consent when judges are appointed? The power for Congress, not the President, to make declarations of war? The power of the President to convene joint sittings of Congress? Clearly, the doctrine of separation of powers, and Question Time are not mutually exclusive forces. The executive and the legislature are already intertwined. They keep a tab on one another and that is the precise purpose of both Question Time and the separation of powers: to keep a tab on decision making of various branches of government and make sure power is not concentrated in one area. Question Time would, as the name suggests, question executive power (true the British PM is part of the House of Commons but the Prime Minister is also ''part'' of the executive under a Parliamentary system). For once it might make Congress take interest in secret executive decisions. Imagine Bush taking Congressional Questions regarding his decision to deploy troops to Iraq. By the same token, Question Time allows the President to critique the legislature in person. It would also allow the President to reason, to compromise and to plead with Congress in order to pass necessary reforms more efficiently. As noted, the President can already convene joint sittings of Congress. Unlike the UK system, however, Members of Congress can speak out against their own party's policy ''without'' being dropped from Cabinet or Congress. This is yet another reason why Question Time is suited more for the US system of government more rather than the UK system of fusion of powers. Therefore, Question Time is a check and balance in and of itself, whether the executive is clarifying his or her qualms with the legislature, or the legislature clarifying their qualms and problems with the President. There is dialogue and accountability between the branches: a very welcomed reform indeed.}} . 

==Energy and environmental policy==. 
McCain has a lifetime pro-environment rating of 24 on a scale of 100 on the [[League of Conservation Voters]]'s ''National Environmental Scorecard,'' which reflects the consensus of experts from about 20 leading environmental organizations. <ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite web | url=http://lcv.org/scorecard/2007.pdf |format=PDF| title=2007 First Session 110th Congress National Environmental Scorecard | publisher=[[League of Conservation Voters]] | accessdate=February 25, 2008}}</ref> According to the League of Conservation Voters' 2006 National Environmental Scorecard, McCain took an "anti-environment" stance on four of seven environmental resolutions during the second session of the 109th congress. The four resolutions dealt with issues such as offshore drilling, an Arctic national wildlife refuge, low-income energy assistance, and environmental funding. <ref>[http://www.lcv.org/images/client/pdfs/LCV_2006_Scorecard_final.pdf "League of Conservative Voters: 2006 National Environmental Scorecard"] Accessed May 6, 2008</ref>  .

===Energy===. 
In a June 2008 analysis of McCain's positions, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said that "the Arizona senator has swerved from one position to another over the years, taking often contradictory stances on the federal government's role in energy policy."<ref name="LAT-1July2008"/> . 

====Energy dependence====. 
{{see also|The Lexington Project}}
On April 23, 2007, McCain gave a major speech on his [[Energy policy of the United States|energy policy]] at the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] in the [[Ronald Reagan Building & International Trade Center]] in Washington, D.C.  He said that U.S. dependence on foreign oil is "a major strategic vulnerability, a serious threat to our security, our economy and the well-being of our planet,"<ref>[http://www.johnmccain.com/informing/news/newsreleases/5097be0c-e4db-4c6d-9949-21d8d177947f.htm Speech on Energy Policy], April 23, 2007, JohnMcCain.com, retrieved July 1, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18269994/ "McCain: Energy, warming are key threats"], MSNBC.com, April 23, 2007</ref> explicitly connecting energy independence with national security, climate change, and the environment. <ref name="msnbc042307">{{cite news | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18269994/ | title = McCain: Energy, warming are twin threats | date = April 23, 2007|publisher=[[MSNBC]] | accessdate =April 27, 2007 }}</ref> . 

In 2008, he said that this dependence "has been thirty years in the making, and was caused by the failure of politicians in Washington to think long term about the future of the country."<ref>{{Cite news| title = Text of McCain's speech| newspaper=[[Rocky Mountain News]]| date = July 7, 2008| url = http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/jul/07/text-mccains-speech/?printer=1/| postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> . 

McCain generally supports increased [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], but has not announced specific targets. He has called for raising gas mileage standards to 35 m.p.g. <ref name=time/> . 

====Oil price increases====. 
"I believe there needs to be a thorough and complete investigation of speculators to find out whether speculation has been going on and, if so, how much it has affected the [[Oil price increases since 2003|price of a barrel of oil]]." "I am very angry, frankly, at the [[Petroleum industry|oil companies]]. Not only because of the obscene profits they've made, but their failure to invest in alternative energy to help us eliminate our dependence on [[Oil reserves|foreign oil]]," McCain said on June 13, 2008. <ref>[http://www.nysun.com/national/mccain-on-wall-street-angry-about-oil/79981/ McCain on Wall Street: 'Angry' About Oil], ''The New York Sun'', June 13, 2008</ref> . 

====Offshore drilling====. 
In McCain's campaign for the presidency in 2000, he supported the federal ban on [[offshore drilling]] for oil. <ref>Dana Milbank, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/16/AR2008061602148.html "Put Your Right Wing In, Take Your Left Wing Out"], ''Washington Post'', June 17, 2008</ref>  In June 2008, McCain reversed his longstanding objection to offshore drilling. Stating that he had changed his views because of high gas prices and dependence on imports, he endorsed legislation that would give each coastal state the power to determine whether to allow offshore drilling. <ref>{{Cite news| title =McCain gambling on offshore drilling | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date = June 24, 2008 | url= http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/politics/la-na-offshore24-2008jun24,0,7495455.story | first1=Cathleen | last1=Decker | first2=Michael | last2=Finnegan | accessdate=May 22, 2010| postscript =<!--None-->}}</ref> .

====Alternative energy sources====. 
McCain has voted to reduce federal funds for [[renewable energy|renewable]] and solar energy. <ref>[http://www.ontheissues.org/John_McCain.htm John McCain on the Issues]</ref> He opposed tax credits in 2001 and 2006 for companies that generate power from solar, wind, geothermal and ocean wave energy. <ref name="LAT-1July2008"/> . 

=====Ethanol for energy=====. 
In 2000, McCain skipped most of the Iowa caucuses during his presidential bid, in large part because his opposition to ethanol subsidies was a nonstarter in a state where making [[maize|corn]] into fuel was a large and profitable business. <ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2007/02/mccain200702 | title=Prisoner of Conscience | author=[[Todd S. Purdum]] |work=Vanity Fair  | date=February 2007 | accessdate=January 4, 2008}}</ref>  . 

While campaigning in 2006 in the Midwest, McCain called ethanol a "vital, vital alternative energy source."<ref name="LAT-1July2008">Noam N.

In April 2007, McCain proposed increasing ethanol imports. <ref name="msnbc042307"/> . 

In May 2008, in response to rising food prices linked to an increased production of ethanol, McCain along with 23 other Republican Senators asked the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] to reduce requirements established by Congress in 2007 that more ethanol and other renewable fuels be blended into the U.S. gasoline supply. <ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120977546363664225.html?mod=googlenews_wsj "Corn Ethanol Loses More Support"] "The Wall Street Journal", May 3, 2008.

=====Nuclear power=====. 
McCain voted five times in the 1990s against taxpayer aid for research on new-generation nuclear reactors. Through 2003, he opposed federal loan guarantees to help the nuclear industry finance new plants. <ref name="LAT-1July2008"/> . 

In 2005, McCain began supporting more taxpayer assistance for [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], as part of his proposed legislation to cap greenhouse gas emissions. <ref name="LAT-1July2008"/> In April 2007, McCain proposed better harnessing of nuclear power, much as Europe has managed to do. <ref name="msnbc042307"/> McCain is now calling for 45 new nuclear reactors to be built in the United States by 2030. <ref>[http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/48898/story.htm Planet Ark : McCain Says Wants 45 New Nuclear Reactors by 2030<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 2008, the [[Public Interest Research Group|U.S. Public Interest Research Group]] and [[Public Citizen]] estimated that one version of McCain's bill would authorize more than $3.7 billion in subsidies for new nuclear plants. <ref name="LAT-1July2008"/> . 

McCain has long been a supporter of the proposed [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]] in [[Nevada]]. In 2008, however, on the eve of a campaign appearance in Nevada, he called for the establishment of "an international repository for spent nuclear fuel", which, he said, might make it unnecessary to open Yucca Mountain. <ref>{{Cite news| last = Ralston| first = Jon| author-link = Jon Ralston | title = McCain’s about-face on Yucca| newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]]| date = May 28, 2008| url =http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/may/28/mccains-about-face-yucca/| postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> . 

The [[Sierra Club]], the [[League of Conservation Voters]], and the Obama campaign have charged that, in a videotaped interview in 2007, McCain reiterated his support for transporting nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain but said he would not be comfortable with such transports going through [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. <ref>{{cite press release| title = New YouTube Video Shows McCain Hypocrisy on Yucca Mountain and Nuclear Waste| publisher=[[Sierra Club]]| date = June 25, 2008| url = http://www.sierraclub.org/pressroom/releases/pr2008-06-25a.asp| accessdate =August 10, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last = League of Conservation Voters| authorlink = League of Conservation Voters| title = John McCain – Position Summary| publisher=League of Conservation Voters| url = http://www.lcv.org/obama/mccain-facts.html| accessdate =August 10, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| last = Conroy| first = Scott| title = Obama's Nevada Ad Hits McCain On Yucca Mountain| publisher=[[CBS News]]| date = August 9, 2008| url = http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2008/08/09/politics/horserace/entry4335314.shtml| accessdate =August 10, 2008}}</ref> The McCain campaign responded by attacking Obama's record on energy issues. <ref>{{Cite news| last = Wheaton| first = Sarah| title = Obama Ad Attacks McCain on Yucca Mountain| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| date = August 9, 2008| url = http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/09/obama-ad-attacks-mccain-on-yucca-mountain/?scp=1&sq=yucca&st=cse| postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> . 

McCain has also been criticized for failing to deal with nuclear waste contamination problems in his home state of Arizona. <ref>{{cite news|title=McCain Turns Back on Grand Canyon|work=The Washington Independent|date=July 22, 2008|first=John|last=Dougherty}}</ref> . 

McCain has repeatedly cited France as a role model because it gets nearly 80% of its electricity from nuclear power, which helps the country to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions, and has made it one of the world's leading net exporters of energy. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/10/us/politics/10nuclear.html?em 2 Endorsements of Nuclear Power, but Sharp Differences on Details], The New York Times,  October 9, 2008</ref> . 

===Global warming===. 
The McCain-[[Joseph Lieberman|Lieberman]] [[Climate Stewardship Act]] of 2003 was defeated in October 2004 by a margin of 43–55. <ref>[http://mccain.senate.gov/press_office/view_article.cfm?id=289 "Senate Casts Historic Vote on McCain-Lieberman Global Warming Bill"], McCain Senate website, October 31, 2003</ref> This bill however would have required power stations to reduce their emissions to the same levels that they were in 2000, three years previous by the year 2010. An act that though stated to be "a very minimal proposal" by Senator McCain to the Senate, "that while woefully inadequate should be the first step." The Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act of 2007<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:s.00280: The Library of Congress, S.280 (introduced 1/12/2007)]</ref> was introduced by Senator Joseph Lieberman, McCain and other co-sponsors in January 2007, with McCain commenting "we continue to learn more about the science of climate change and the dangerous precedence of not addressing this environmental problem. The science tells us that urgent and significant action is needed."<ref>[http://mccain.senate.gov/press_office/view_article.cfm?id=803 "Senator McCain Remarks on Climate Stewardship Act of 2007"], McCain Senate website, January 12, 2007</ref> . 

In April 2007, McCain called [[global warming]] "a serious and urgent economic, environmental and national security challenge" and said that the problem "isn't a Hollywood invention."<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/23/AR2007042300786.html McCain: Address Energy Security, Warming], Washington Post, April 23, 2007</ref> . 

In September 2007, McCain said that he supported a 65% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050. <ref>Martha T. Moore, [http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2007-09-27-candidates-climate_N.htm "Renewable energy: Dems, GOP diverge"], ''USA Today'', September 27, 2007</ref>  . 

In a campaign video in January 2008, McCain said "I believe that America did the right thing by not joining the Kyoto treaty, but I believe that if we could get China and India into it, then the United States should seriously consider on our terms joining with every other nation in the world to try and reduce greenhouse gases. It's got to be a global effort."<ref>Lorrie Goldstein, [http://www.edmontonsun.com/Comment/2008/04/10/5244761-sun.html "Kyoto rhetoric meets reality"], ''Edmonton Sun'', April 10, 2008</ref><ref>Michael DelliVener, [http://www.regishighlander.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&uStory_id=ba7c3bf7-e81c-47d4-9b97-56497d5e6656 "The presidential candidates on climate change"],''Regis Highlander'', February 5, 2008</ref> . 

In a February 2010 Arizona radio interview, after the host had made lengthy comments claiming that “80 percent” of global warming science “is based on fraud and misinformation,” McCain, who had previously countered such inaccurate statements, made no correction. <ref name="tp021710">McCain never favored cap, Think Progress, http://thinkprogress.org/2010/02/17/mccain-never-favored-cap/</ref> . 

====Cap and trade====. 
McCain's position on greenhouse gas emissions calls for a timetable mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency that gradually reduces greenhouse ceilings. McCain's stance also includes an emission credit system that regulates each metric ton of greenhouse a company produces. This plan is to be put in to effect by 2012. <ref>[http://www.purchasing.com/article/CA6554640.html?industryid=48372 "Green Report: Where the candidates stand on environmental issues"] Accessed May 6, 2008</ref> .

By September 2009, McCain had largely disengaged from the climate change debate, and criticized the [[Waxman-Markey Climate Change Bill]] out of the House as "appear[ing] to be a cap & tax bill that I won't support" and having "a lot of special deals for a lot of special interests."<ref name="wapo-climate-09">[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/12/AR2009091202726.html?hpid=topnews "On Climate, Partners on Hill Drift Apart"], Juliet Eilperin

====Automobile standards====. 
In February 2007, McCain and Gov. [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] called for a nationwide roll-out of California's new low carbon fuel standard. <ref>[http://newsmax.com/archives/ic/2007/2/21/202817.shtml "McCain Backs Schwarzenegger Eco Plan"], [[Reuters]], February 21, 2007. </ref>  In April 2007, McCain proposed moving from exploration to production of plug-in electric vehicles. <ref name="msnbc042307"/> .

===Everglades===. 
In 2007, McCain sided with Bush against Florida Republicans in opposing a Congressional override of Bush's veto of a water projects bill that would have approved $2 billion for [[restoration of the Everglades]], despite $7.8 billion that had been earmarked for the [[Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan]] (CERP) in 2000.

===Colorado River water allocation===. 
The [[Colorado River Compact]] allocates the water of the [[Colorado River]] among seven states.

==Social policy==. 
McCain's 2006 rating by the [[Almanac of American Politics]] (2008) on Social Policy is 46% conservative, 53% liberal. (2005: 64% conservative, 23% liberal.)<ref name="aap-08-ratings"/>  McCain also has an 83% rating from the [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]], which indicates many socially conservative views such as voting yes on $75M for abstinence education, yes on recommending a [[Flag Desecration Amendment|Constitutional ban]] on [[flag desecration]], and voting yes on memorial prayers and religious symbols at school.  . 

===Abortion===. 
{{see also|Abortion in the United States}}
McCain has stated that he believes [[life]] begins at the moment of [[Human fertilization|conception]] and that embryos should be afforded full human rights. <ref>Charles Babington and Beth Fouhy , [http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jws4AA64vCAkXKXnPNSwY93tZ-GAD92JR3FG0], ''Associated Press'', August 17, 2008</ref> . 

In June 1984, McCain voted for H.AMDT.942, the [[Mark D. Siljander|Siljander]] amendment, to H.R.5490, "An amendment to define "person" as including unborn children from the moment of conception". <ref>[http://www.nchla.org/keyvoteabt.asp?vote=307 House Amendment 942]</ref> . 

In 1999, McCain said of Roe v. Wade, "I'd love to see a point where it is irrelevant, and could be repealed because abortion is no longer necessary. But certainly in the short term, or even the long term, I would not support repeal of ''Roe v. Wade'', which would then force X number of women in America to [undergo] illegal and dangerous operations."<ref>Terry M. Neal.

McCain voted to reauthorize the Patriot Act, extending the measure with some amendments clarifying the rights of an individual who has received [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|FISA]] orders to challenge nondisclosure requirements and to refuse disclosure of the name of their attorney. Voting against this bill would have terminated the Patriot Act. <ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.ontheissues.org/VoteMatch/q19_2006.asp VoteMatch: The Patriot Act harms civil liberties<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . 

McCain voted to extend the Patriot Act’s Wiretap Provision. This piece of legislation would allow the FBI to use roaming wiretaps on U.S. residents and would concede to the Federal Agents entry and access to corporate accounts. Voting for this bill would extend the Patriot Act to December 31, 2009, thereby making its provisions permanent whereas voting against this bill would keep the Patriot Act provisional. <ref name=autogenerated2 /> . 

In 2010, McCain cosponsored a bill, the [[Enemy Belligerent Interrogation, Detention and Prosecution Act]], that would authorize the U.S. military to arrest anyone, U.S. citizen or otherwise, who is suspected of terrorist associations and detain them indefinitely, without right to a trial or a lawyer. <ref>http://www.opencongress.org/articles/view/1715-McCain-and-Lieberman-s-Nightmarish-Detention-Bill</ref><ref>http://assets.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/politics/ARM10090.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/03/a-detention-bill-you-ought-to-read-more-carefully/37116/</ref> . 

===Conscription (the draft)===. 
In 1999, when the U.S. military was experiencing significant recruiting shortfalls, McCain was one of several members of Congress who mused publicly about reinstating [[Conscription in the United States|the draft]]. <ref>{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804E2D8173BF934A35751C0A96F958260 | title= The Nation: The Short-Handed Military; A Wisp of a Draft | author=Myers, Steven Lee |work=The New York Times | date=February 7, 1999 | accessdate=August 26, 2008}}</ref>  . 

In a December 2007 interview, McCain said that reinstating [[Conscription in the United States|the draft]] would be a "terrific mistake" and that "the all-volunteer force is working, and it's the most professional and best trained and equipped we've ever had."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vnews.com/profiles/mccain.html |title=Always in It to Win It |accessdate=August 25, 2008 |date= |publisher=[[Valley News]]}}</ref>   . 

In a November/December 2007 essay in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', McCain wrote, "In 1947, the Truman administration launched a massive overhaul of the nation's foreign policy, defense, and intelligence agencies to meet the challenges of the Cold War. Today, we must do the same to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century. Our armed forces are seriously overstretched and underresourced. As president, I will increase the size of the U.S. Army and the Marine Corps from the currently planned level of roughly 750,000 troops to 900,000 troops. Enhancing recruitment will require more resources and will take time, but it must be done as soon as possible."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20071101faessay86602/john-mccain/an-enduring-peace-built-on-freedom.html | title=An Enduring Peace Built on Freedom | author=McCain, John |work=[[Foreign Affairs]] | date=November/December 2007 | accessdate=August 26, 2008}}</ref> . 

At a town hall meeting on June 24, 2008, McCain stated, "I don't know what would make a draft happen unless we were in an all-out World War III."<ref name="reut062508">{{cite news | url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/gc05/idUKN2438836820080625 | title=McCain says only World War III would justify draft |agency=Reuters   | date=June 25, 2008 | accessdate=August 26, 2008 | first=Steve | last=Holland}}</ref>  He further stated, "I do not believe the draft is even practicable or desirable."<ref name="reut062508"/> . 

In September 2007, while speaking about issuing a draft, McCain said, "One, it's the best military we've ever had, it just isn't big enough. Two, there's never been a draft that I've ever heard of since World War II that was fair. What we've done is we find rich people find a way out, and lower income people are the ones that serve. I might consider it, I don't think it's necessary, but I might consider it if you could design a draft where everybody equally would serve. But it just doesn't happen. And the other thing is that, because you know from here in Brauman, it takes intensive training with the equipment and the technical skills that now our people are required to engage in, that it makes it not conducive to a short term. Now they enlist for 4 years. We used to draft people almost for 2 years or even 18 months so it's much more difficult."<ref>[http://www.womenforjohnmccain.com/?p=625 Experienced Leadership.

===Education===. 
McCain supports the use of [[school vouchers]]. <ref name="oti-eduction">{{cite web | url=http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/John_McCain_Education.htm | title=John McCain on Education | publisher=On the Issues | accessdate=April 19, 2008}}</ref>  Some of McCain's votes include voting yes on school vouchers in DC, yes on education savings accounts, yes on allowing more flexibility in federal school rules, and voting no on $5 billion for grants to local educational agencies. <ref name="oti-eduction"/>  He supports merit pay for teachers, along with firing them if they don't meet certain standards. He sponsored the Education A-Plus bill in 1997 and again in 1999, which would have allowed parents to open tax-free savings accounts for their children's school expenses, such as tutoring, computers and books. McCain co-sponsored the Child Nutrition Act, which would provide federal funding for at-risk children. He said when running for President in 2000 that he would take $5.4 billion away from sugar, gas and ethanol subsidies and pour that money into a test voucher program for every poor school district in America. He voted against diverting $51.9 million away from the Department of Labor and putting it towards after-school community learning centers, and he voted against an amendment which would fund smaller class sizes rather than providing funds for private tutors.  . 

In 2005, McCain announced that he supported the inclusion of [[intelligent design]] teaching in schools. <ref name = AZStar>{{cite news | url = http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/politics/90069 | title = McCain sounds like presidential hopeful | date = August 24, 2005 | first = C.J. | last = Karamargin|publisher=[[Arizona Daily Star]] | accessdate =August 15, 2006 }}</ref> He told the ''[[Arizona Daily Star]]'' that, "I think that there has to be all points of view presented.

He did not speculate, in his published theories at least, on the origin of life. The only undeniable challenge the theory of evolution poses to Christian beliefs is its obvious contradiction of the idea that God created the world as it is in less than a week."<ref name="abc022207"/> . 

In 2006, McCain voted to increase the Pell Grant scholarship to a maximum of $4,500, increases future math and science teacher student loan forgiveness to $23,000, and restore education program cuts slated for vocational education, adult education, [[GEAR UP]], and TRIO. <ref>[http://www.ontheissues.org/Social/John_McCain_Education.htm John McCain on Education<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:SP177: Search Results – THOMAS (Library of Congress)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On July 29, 2007, McCain voted against a bill increasing federal student loans and [[Pell Grant]]s and expanding eligibility for financial aid. <ref>[http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=1&vote=00272 Roll call vote on H.R. 2669]</ref><ref>[http://www.nasfaa.org/publications/2007/ccrasummary.html "Initial Summary Of The College Cost Reduction Act"]</ref> In 2008, he expressed support for increasing the funding of Pell Grants, saying, "We should not burden our young men and women after college with debt."<ref>[http://media.www.dailynebraskan.com/media/storage/paper857/news/2008/04/24/News/Students.Look.To.Candidates.For.Loan.Reform-3346435.shtml Students look to candidates for loan reform – News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . 

===Gun control===. 
In a speech before the National Rifle Association in September 2007, McCain said "For more than two decades, I've opposed the efforts of the anti-gun crowd to ban guns, ban ammunition, ban magazines, and paint gun owners as some kind of fringe group; dangerous in 'modern' America. Some even call you 'extremists.' My friends, gun owners are not extremists, you are the core of modern America."<ref>[http://www.nraila.org/Legislation/Federal/Read.aspx?id=3250 "Presidential Candidates Address NRA Celebration Of American Values"], National Rifle Association, September 28, 2007, retrieved April 16, 2008</ref> McCain was a signatory of an [[amicus brief]] (friend of the court) filed on behalf of 55 U.S. Senators, 250 Representatives and Vice-President Dick Cheney, advising that the Supreme Court case [[District of Columbia v.

===Illegal drugs===. 
McCain has said that as president he would push for more money and military help to drug-supplying nations such as [[Colombia]]. He supports expanding the use of federally funded drug treatment and prevention programs and forging public/private partnerships. McCain supported the [[Drug Free Borders Act]] of 1999, which provided $1 billion to increase detection of illegal drugs entering the country and also supported the authorization of $53 million in international development funds to stop illegal narcotics. <ref name="McCain-Drugs"/> . 

In 1999, in a Republican presidential debate at [[Dartmouth College]], McCain opposed the [[Decriminalization of marijuana in the United States|legalization]] of [[marijuana]]. He said, "We’re losing the [[war on drugs]]. We ought to say, 'It’s not a war anymore,' or we really ought to go after it. And there was a time in our history when we weren’t always losing the war on drugs. It was when [[Nancy Reagan]] had a very simple program called '[[Just Say No]].' And young Americans were reducing the usage of drugs in America." At the debate, McCain called marijuana a "gateway drug". <ref name="McCain-Drugs">[http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/John_McCain_Drugs.htm "John McCain on Drugs"], OnTheIssues.org, retrieved April 21, 2008</ref> . 

===Immigration===. 
McCain has promoted the legislation and eventually the granting of citizenship to the estimated 12–20 million [[Illegal immigration|illegal aliens]] in the United States and the creation of an additional guest worker program with an option for permanent [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]]. His prominent role in promoting the Senate's [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006|2006 immigration legislation]], including an initial cosponsorhip role with [[Ted Kennedy]], made him a focus of the debate in 2006, and his support for [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007|S.1348]] did so again in 2007. The immigration issue caused intense friction within his own party, such as when ''[[The Washington Times]]'' reported that McCain and South Carolina Senator [[Lindsey Graham]] "first checked with Mr. Kennedy before deciding to vote with the Massachusetts Democrat on an amendment to the Senate bill."<ref>Hallow, Ralph Z. 
[http://www3.washingtontimes.com/national/20070608-124010-3947r.htm "Kennedy alliance costly to GOP senators".] ''The Washington Times'', 2008-06-08. Retrieved on March 4, 2008. </ref>  McCain's immigration stance was widely cited as a major reason for his presidential campaign's difficulty during most of 2007.  . 

In his bid for the 2000 Presidential nomination, McCain supported expansion of the [[H-1B visa]] program, a temporary visa for skilled workers. <ref>[http://www.techlawjournal.com/cong106/h1b/19990819mcc.htm Excerpts from Speech by Sen.

McCain campaigned against [[Arizona Proposition 200 (2004)|Proposition 200]], a 2004 Arizona state initiative intended to prevent illegal immigrants from voting, receiving welfare benefits, and mandated state agencies to report illegals to the federal government. McCain argued Prop 200 would be overly expensive to execute, that it would be ineffectual, and that immigration regulation falls only under the purview of the federal government. <ref>[http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2004/10/11/daily63.html McCain tapped for homestretch campaign help], Phoenix Business Journal, October 15, 2004</ref> . 

McCain has repeatedly argued that low-skilled immigrant labor is necessary to supply service roles that native-born Americans refuse. In one widely remarked-upon incident, he insisted to a union group that none of them would be willing to pick lettuce for fifty dollars an hour. The audience interrupted with offers and several weeks later demonstrators showed up at his Phoenix office to apply for lettuce picking work. <ref>[http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/border/124762 McCain's lettuce-picking remarks yield unwanted green] Arizona Daily Star, April 15, 2006</ref> . 

In May 2007, McCain conceded to [[Fox News Channel]]'s [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] that passage of amnesty will permanently change the [[Demography of the United States|ethnic makeup]] of the country. He supports a path to citizenship for an estimated twelve to twenty million immigrants, on the condition of a thirteen year waiting period. <ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,276732,00.html GOP Presidential Hopeful John McCain Sits Down With Bill O'Reilly] FoxNews.com, May 31, 2007</ref> . 

In June 2007, McCain voted in favor of declaring English as the [[official language]] of the federal government. <ref>[http://waternoice.com/2008/08/03/obama-vs-mcain-%E2%80%93-immigration/ Water, No Ice » Blog Archive » Obama vs. McCain – Immigration<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . 

McCain has subsequently stated that the nation's first priority must be to emphasize border security, and that debate over immigration is a secondary issue. <ref>[http://kvoa.com/Global/story.asp?S=7308781&nav=HMO6HMaY McCain adjusts immigration stance to emphasize border security first], Associated Press, November 3, 2007</ref> . 

Shortly before its April 2010 passage in the [[Arizona State Senate]], McCain supported [[Arizona SB1070]], which gained national attention as the broadest and strictest anti-illegal immigration measure in decades within the United States. <ref name="nyt-az-law">{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/us/politics/24immig.html?ref=us | title=U.S.’s Toughest Immigration Law Is Signed in Arizona | author=Archibold, Randal C. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=April 24, 2010 | page=1}}</ref> . 

===LGBTQ rights and issues===. 
In 1996 McCain voted against the [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act]], which would have prohibited discrimination against employees on the basis of [[sexual orientation]]. <ref name="Gay Victory Within Reach">Gerstein, Josh.

In October 2006, McCain said he would consider changing the U.S. military's [[don't ask, don't tell]] policy: "The day that the leadership of the military comes to me and says, 'Senator, we ought to change the policy,' then I think we ought to consider seriously changing it."<ref name="wapo020310">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/02/AR2010020202588.html | title=McCain appears to shift on 'don't ask, don't tell' | author=Michael D.

In January 2010, when Defense Secretary [[Robert M. Gates]] and Joint Chiefs Chairman [[Mike Mullen]] – the top civilian and uniform leadership of the military – came out in favor of repealing the policy, McCain said he was "disappointed" by their stance: "At this moment of immense hardship for our armed services, we should not be seeking to overturn the [[Don't ask, don't tell]] policy," which he described as "imperfect but effective."<ref name="wapo020310"/> McCain also criticized Gates for what he saw as an attempt to usurp Congressional authority over the policy.  .

When asked if he supported [[civil unions]] for homosexuals, McCain said: "I do not."<ref>[http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2007/09/04/post_56.html McCain Not Sure on "LGBT" Issues"], "The Trail", washingtonpost.com, September 4, 2007</ref> Still, on the [[Ellen Degeneres Show]] on May 22, 2008, McCain said that people ought to be able to enter "legal agreements ... particularly in the case of insurance and other areas", but that the "unique status of marriage" should be retained between a man and a woman."<ref>[http://newsbusters.org/blogs/terry-ann-rendon/2008/05/22/ellen-degeneres-sen-mccain-there-old-way-thinking-we-are-not-all-a Ellen DeGeneres To Sen.

In July 2008, McCain told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that "I think that we’ve proven that both parents are important in the success of a family so, no I don’t believe in gay adoption."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/us/politics/13text-mccain.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&pagewanted=print&oref=slogin "The Times Interviews John McCain"], ''New York Times'', July 13, 2008</ref> Two days later, McCain's Director of Communications said "McCain could have been clearer in the interview in stating that his position on gay adoption is that it is a state issue, just as he made it clear in the interview that marriage is a state issue."<ref>Andrew Sullivan, [http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/07/mccain-clarifie.html "McCain Clarifies On Gay Adoption"], "The Daily Dish", ''Atlantic Monthly'', July 15, 2008</ref> John McCain has later said, that despite his opposition, he could see the benefit of a child being adopted by a same-sex couple rather than being at an orphanage.  . 

===Martin Luther King Holiday===. 
In 1983, McCain opposed creating a federal holiday in honor of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] The House vote was 338–90 and President Reagan signed the bill into law later that year,<ref>Laura Meckler and Nick Timiraos, [http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/04/03/mccain-clinton-head-to-memphis-for-mlk-anniversary/ "McCain, Clinton Head to Memphis for MLK Anniversary"], "Washington Wire", ''Wall Street Journal'', April 3, 2008</ref>  creating [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day]].  . 

McCain continued his opposition to a holiday for King by supporting [[Governor of Arizona]] [[Evan Mecham]]'s rescinding of the Arizona state holiday for King in 1987. <ref name="fox040408">{{cite news | url=http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/04/04/mccain-gives-mea-culpa-in-memphis-over-vote-against-king-holiday/ | title=McCain Gives Mea Culpa in Memphis Over Vote Against King Holiday |publisher=Fox News | date=April 4, 2008 | accessdate=April 12, 2008}}</ref>  By 1989, McCain reiterated his opposition to the federal holiday,<ref name="fox040408"/> but reversed position on the state holiday, due to the economic boycotts and image problems Arizona was receiving as a result of it not having one. <ref name="fox040408"/>   . 

In 1990, McCain persuaded Reagan to issue a statement of support for the holiday through McCain’s office, asking Arizonans to "join me in supporting a holiday to commemorate these ideals to which Dr. King dedicated his life."<ref>Tapper, Jake.

In April 2008, McCain said <blockquote>We can be slow as well to give greatness its due, a mistake I made myself long ago when I voted against a federal holiday in memory of Dr. King. I was wrong and eventually realized that, in time to give full support for a state holiday in Arizona. We can all be a little late sometimes in doing the right thing, and Dr. King understood this about his fellow Americans. <ref>Paul Schmelzer, [http://www.minnesotamonitor.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=3624 "McCain: 1983 vote against MLK holiday a 'mistake'"], ''Minnesota Monitor'', April 4, 2008</ref></blockquote> . 

===Mixed Martial Arts===. 
McCain saw a tape of the first [[UFC]] events and immediately found it abhorrent. McCain himself led a campaign to ban UFC, calling it "human cockfighting," and sending letters to the governors of all fifty US states asking them to ban the event. <ref name="Slate">{{cite news|url= http://www.slate.com/id/46344|work=Slate.com|title=Fight Clubbed|first=David|last=Plotz|date =November 7, 1999|accessdate=March 21, 2007}}</ref> . 

===Public service===. 
McCain believes that more Americans should get involved in public service. "If you find fault with our country, make it a better one...When healthy skepticism sours into corrosive cynicism, our expectations of our government become reduced to the delivery of services. For too many Americans, the idea of good citizenship does not extend beyond walking into a voting booth every two or four years and pulling a lever – and too few Americans demand of themselves even that first obligation of self-government."<ref>{{cite news

===Stem cell research===. 
McCain is a member of The [[Republican Main Street Partnership]] and supports [[embryonic stem cell]] research. McCain had earlier opposed embyronic stem cell research<ref>{{cite news | title = GOP hopefuls getting more time to weigh stem-cell vote | date = October 25, 2005 | first = Jonathan | last = Allen | url = http://www.hillnews.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/102505/stemcells.html|publisher=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] | accessdate =August 15, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060420055356/http://www.hillnews.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/102505/stemcells.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = April 20, 2006}}</ref> and credits former First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]], a prominent Republican supporter of such research, with changing his mind in 2001. <ref>{{cite news|title=Obama's Stem Cell Spinning|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/161708/page/2|date=September 30, 2008|accessdate=March 30, 2009|author=Novak, Viveca|work=Factcheck.org|work=Newsweek}}</ref> He states that he believes that stem cell research, and indeed embryonic stem cell research, will continue whether or not the U.S. sanctions it, and so it would be the wisest course of action to support it to the extent that the United States will be able to regulate and monitor the use.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} In July 2008 he said “At the moment I support stem cell research [because of] the potential it has for curing some of the most terrible diseases that afflict mankind.”<ref>Laura Meckler, [http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/07/17/mccain-speaks-out-against-abortions/ "McCain Speaks Out Against Abortions"], ''Wall Street Journal'', July 17, 2008</ref> . 

McCain opposes embryonic stem cell research that uses cloned human embryos. In 2006 he supported a trio of U.S. Senate bills designed to increase federal funding for adult stem cell research, ban the creation of embryos for research and offer federal support for research using embryos slated for destruction by fertility clinics. In 2007, in what he described as "a very agonizing and tough decision," he voted to allow research using human embryos left over from fertility treatments. [http://pewforum.org/religion08/compare.php?Issue=Stem_Cell_Research] Pew Forum, 2008 . 

===Taxes on cigarettes===. 
In 1998, McCain supported an unsuccessful bill that would have imposed a federal tax of $1.10 per pack on cigarettes to fund programs to cut underage smoking. "I still regret we did not succeed", he said in October 2007. In 2007, McCain voted against legislation that would have used a 61-cents-per-pack tax to expand a children's health program, saying that he disagreed with the concept: "We are trying to get people not to smoke, and yet we are depending on tobacco to fund a program that's designed for children's health?"<ref>Michael Kranish, [http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/03/26/mccains_stand_on_tobacco_is_put_to_test/ "McCain's stand on tobacco is put to test: Senator steps back on oversight measure"], ''Boston Globe'', March 26, 2008</ref> In February 2008 he said that he would have a "no new taxes" policy as president. <ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23212854/ "McCain says no new taxes if he's elected: Republican candidate's statement marks turnabout"], ''Associated Press'', February 17, 2008</ref> . 

===Vaccination===. 
On February 28, 2008 McCain told [[ABC News]]' [[Bret Hovell]], "It's indisputable that ([[autism]]) is on the rise amongst children, the question is what's causing it. And we go back and forth and there's strong evidence that indicates that it's got to do with a [[Thiomersal controversy|preservative in vaccines]]."<ref>{{cite news |author=Tapper, Jake |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/02/john-mccain-ent.html |title= John McCain enters the autism wars |work=ABC News |date=February 29, 2008 |accessdate=March 3, 2008}}</ref> .
