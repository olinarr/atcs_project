'''Government spending''' (or '''government expenditure''') includes all government consumption, investment but excludes transfer payments<ref>Robert Barro and Vittorio Grilli (1994), ''European Macroeconomics'', Ch. 15-16. Macmillan, ISBN 0333577647. </ref> made by a [[State_(polity)|state]]. Government acquisition of goods and services for current use to directly satisfy individual or collective needs of the members of the community is classed as [[government final consumption expenditure]]. Government acquisition of goods and services [[Invest#Economics|intended to create future benefits]], such as infrastructure investment or research spending, is classed as government investment ([[gross fixed capital formation]]), which usually is the largest part of the government [http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Gross_capital_formation gross capital formation]. Acquisition of goods and services is made through own production by the government (using the government's labour force, fixed assets and purchased goods and services for [[intermediate consumption]]) or through purchases of goods and services from market producers. Government expenditures that are not acquisition of goods and services, and instead just represent transfers of money, such as social security payments, are called [[transfer payment]]s. Government spending can be financed by [[seigniorage]], [[taxes]], or government [[debt|borrowing]].  . 

The first two types of government spending, namely government final consumption expenditure and government gross capital formation, together constitute one of the major components of [[gross domestic product]].  . 

[[John Maynard Keynes]] was one of the first [[economists]] to advocate government [[deficit spending]] as part of the [[fiscal policy]] response to an [[recession|economic contraction]]. In [[Keynesian economics]], increased government spending is thought to raise [[aggregate demand]] and increase [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]], which in turn leads to increased production. Keynesian economists argue that the [[Great Depression]] was ended by government spending programs such as the [[New Deal]] and military spending during [[World War II]]. According to the Keynesian view, a severe recession or depression may never end if the government does not intervene.  . 

[[Classical economists]] and [[Austrian economists]], on the other hand, believe that increased government spending exacerbates an [[recession|economic contraction]] by shifting resources from the private sector, which they consider productive, to the public sector, which they consider unproductive. According to Austrian economists, the reason the Great Depression lasted as long as it did was because of significant government spending and government regulation of the economy.  . 

==United States of America== . 

[[National Income and Product Accounts#Accounting for National Product: The Right Side of the Report|Government spending]] in the United States of America occurs at several levels of government, including primarily
federal, state, and local governments.  The [[United States Census Bureau]] publishes an overview of government
spending every year in the [[Statistical Abstract of the United States]]<ref>[http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/ Statistical Abstract of the United States of America]</ref> . 

At the time of this entry, the most recent year for which actual spending for all levels of government has been reported. Overall government spending for all
levels of government in the United States of America was as follows:

Government spending expressed as a percent of [[Gross Domestic Product]] is based on a total of $14,660.4 billion for calendar year 2010
reported by the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]]. <ref>[http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls Current-dollar and "real" GDP]</ref> . 

===Federal Spending===. 
{{update|date=November 2010}} . 

{{Details|United States federal budget}}
{{As of|2004|alt=As of September 2004}} the U.S. [[Congressional Budget Office]] reported that [[federal government]] spending for 2004 was projected to be $2.293 trillion, or slightly less than 20% of the GDP. Of that, $646.7 billion was for net [[interest]], $486 billion for [[defense (military)|defense]], $492 billion for [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], $473 billion for [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]], $191 billion for various [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] programs, $136 billion for "retirement and disability" benefits, and $64 billion was projected to be spent elsewhere.  . 

There are two types of government spending — discretionary and mandatory.  Discretionary spending, which accounts for roughly one-third of all Federal spending, includes money for things like the [[United States Army|Army]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], and highway projects.  Congress explicitly determines how much to spend (or not spend) on these programs on an annual basis.  Mandatory spending accounts for two-thirds of all government spending.  This kind of spending is authorized by permanent laws.  It includes Insurance programs like Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and federal retirement and disability programs that provide benefits to federal civilian employees, members of the military, and veterans. — programs through which individuals receive benefits based on their age, income, or other criteria.  Spending levels in these areas are dictated by the number of people who sign up for these benefits, rather than by Congress.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} . 

===State and Local Spending=== . 

The [[United States Census Bureau]] conducts a census of [http://www.census.gov/govs/estimate/ State and Local Government Finances]
every five years and updates the census every year.  The latest fiscal year reported
by the Census Bureau is 2006.  . 

===US History=== . 

The [[United States Census Bureau]] publishes historical data series on government spending in the [[United States]] in its [[Statistical Abstract of the United States]]<ref>[http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/ Statistical Abstract of the United States]</ref> and in its special release of historical statistics in 1976 at the time of the US Bicentennial. <ref>[http://www2.census.gov/prod2/statcomp/documents/CT1970p2-01.pdf Bicentennial Edition: Historical Statistics of the United States, Colonial Times to 1970, Part 2]</ref> . 

Over the last century starting overall government spending in the [[United States]] has increased substantially from about seven percent of GDP in 1902 to about 35 percent of GDP in 2010.  Major spikes in spending occurred in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].  . 

When broken down by major function, the history of US government spending as a percent of GDP shows a slow and consistent increase in education spending; it shows the spikes in defense spending during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], and the sustained high level maintained during the [[Cold War]].  Spending on welfare shows a clear takeoff during the [[Great Depression]] and a modest decline following reform in 1996. Spending on pensions (primarily [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]) begins to show up in the 1950s.  Health care spending takes off after the birth of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] in the 1960s and shows sustained growth ever since.  . 

==US Government Spending Patterns==. 
===Divided vs. United Government=== . 

In an interview with [[Charlie Rose]], [[Milton Friedman]] noted that US government spending declines fastest when Democrats control the executive branch while Republicans control the legislature. <ref>{{cite web|last=Friedman|first=Milton|title=Milton Friedman interview with Charlie Rose|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDEJ2gl2hp8|accessdate=19 March 2011}}</ref> . 

Referencing accounts from the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] and the voting record, it can be seen that US government spending typically declines as a percentage of [[GDP]] when no party controls both the executive and legislative branches.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} .

This compares to the 2010 World average spending of $2376 per citizen and an average of $16,110 per citizen for the World's 20 largest economies (in terms of GDP). Of the 20 largest economies, only six spent less per citizen: [[South Korea]] ($4557), [[Brazil]] ($2813), [[Russia]] ($2458), [[China]] ($1010), and [[India]] ($$226). Of the 13 that spent more, [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] top the list with per citizen spending of $40908 and $26760 respectively. <ref>CIA World Factbook, population data from 2010, Spending and GDP data from 2011</ref> .
