==History==. 
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington was founded in 2003 to expose, deter and litigate legal and ethical wrongdoing by members of Congress.  The idea for the organization originated in part with co-founder [[Norman Eisen]], as a counter-weight to conservative watchdog groups like [[Judicial Watch]]. <ref>[http://www.msmagazine.com/winter2007/2007-02-01-mostfearedwoman.asp The Most Feared Woman on Capitol Hill?];''Ms. Magazine''; Linda Burstyn; Winter 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.q-and-a.org/Transcript/qa_sloanetranscript.htm Q&A Interview with Melanie Sloan, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW)]; CSPAN Transcripts; May 13, 2009</ref> .

In 2010 [[Politico (newspaper)|''Politico'']]'s [[Ben Smith (journalist)|Ben Smith]] described CREW's founding in 2003 as "one of a wave of new groups backed by [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] donors" and called CREW "a vehicle for assaults on largely – but not entirely – [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] targets". <ref name=staffing>"Staffing up for Congressional investigations" by Ben Smith, Politico, November 18, 2010, [http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1110/Staffing_up_for_Congressional_investigations.html Online]</ref> In 2006 ''[[Congressional Quarterly]]'' reported, "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington has taken aim almost exclusively at [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] members of Congress.
