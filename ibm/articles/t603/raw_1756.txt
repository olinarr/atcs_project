'''Jeffrey Lane "Jeff" Flake''' (born December 31, 1962) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|Arizona|6}}, serving since 2001. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He was featured in the documentary series ''[[How Democracy Works Now: Twelve Stories]]''.  . 

Flake is running for a seat in the [[United States Senate]] in 2012. <ref>Camia, Catalina (2011-02-14) [http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2011/02/jeff-flake-gabrielle-giffords-arizona-senate-/1 "GOP Rep. Jeff Flake kicks off Senate bid in Arizona"] ''USA Today''. Retrieved 2011-02-14. </ref> . 

==Early life, education, and early career==. 
Flake was born in [[Snowflake, Arizona|Snowflake]], [[Arizona]], the son of Nerita (née Hock) and Dean Maeser Flake. <ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/flake.htm</ref> His birth town was named in part for his great-great-grandfather, [[Mormon pioneer]] [[William J. Flake]]. <ref name="60minutes">CBS ''60 Minutes'', [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/11/02/60minutes/main2145860.shtml ''Rep. Flake On Cutting Congressional Pork'']. Consulted on July 27, 2007. </ref> Flake was educated at [[Brigham Young University]] and was a [[Mormon missionary]] for [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] to [[South Africa]] in the early 1980s. He worked in the public affairs sector after college and served as Executive Director of the Foundation for Democracy in [[Namibia]] and Executive Director of the [[Goldwater Institute]] before entering the House of Representatives.  . 

==U.S. House of Representatives==. 
===Elections===. 
Flake was first elected to what was then {{ushr|AZ|1}} in 2000, after Republican incumbent [[Matt Salmon]] stepped down in honor of a self-imposed [[term limit]]. The district was then renumbered to the 6th district as Arizona gained two Congressional seats due to the results of the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]].  . 

In his campaign in 2000, Flake had pledged to serve no more than three terms in Congress, leaving no later than January 2007, but in early 2005, shortly after being elected for a third time, Flake announced that he had changed his mind and would in fact run for re-election in 2006. "It was a mistake to limit my own terms," Flake said. <ref>Stone, Andrea. "Term-limit pledges get left behind". ''USA Today''. April 12, 2006. [http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-04-12-term-limits_x.htm]</ref> . 

Flake's departures from the Republican party-line on certain issues earned him a closely watched [[primary election|primary]] challenge in 2004.  He easily defeated the challenger. <ref>Arizona Secretary of State website: [http://www.azsos.gov/results/2004/primary/REP-1006.htm]. Retrieved January 7, 2006. </ref>  In that same election, three out of five mayors in his home district opposed his re-election as he did not "bring [[pork barrel spending]]" to the mayors' cities. <ref name="60minutes"/>  In  2006, several Democrats had announced their intention to run for the seat; however, only one met the June filing deadline and that particular filing was rejected due to an insufficient amount of nominating signatures. "I did expect to have a primary opponent. I deserve one," Flake said, referring to the term-limit pledge which he had broken. "By all rights, I ought to have an opponent. I just got lucky, I guess."<ref>Paul Giblin, [http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/index.php?sty=69510 "Flake faces solo race after judge removes hopeful"], ''East Valley Tribune'', July 12, 2006</ref> . 

In the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 mid-term elections]], Flake had no [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] opponent and easily defeated the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] candidate, Jason Blair, with 74% of the vote. <ref>[http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006//pages/results/states/AZ/H/06/index.html CNN]</ref> . 

===Tenure===. 
[[File:Jeff Flake by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|Jeff Flake at the 2011 Veterans Day parade in Phoenix, Arizona.]]
Flake is often among a handful of Republicans casting 'no' votes on bills most of his party supports. <ref name="reason">''Reason Magazine'', [http://www.reason.com/news/show/116504.html ''Who Deserves the Libertarian Vote?'']. Consulted on July 27, 2007. </ref>  . 

;Spending
Flake is a fiscal conservative. <ref>Copeland, Libby (2006-07-09) [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/08/AR2006070800966_pf.html Congressman Paul's Legislative Strategy? He'd Rather Say Not.], ''[[Washington Post]]''</ref> He is a critic of government waste and advocates reducing federal spending. <ref name="eastvalley">{{cite web |url= http://blogs.eastvalleytribune.com/view.php?op=ViewArticle&articleId=1728&blogId=31|title= It's gotta be the hair|accessdate= 2007-08-05|date= 2007-07-12|publisher= East Valley Tribune}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> He was described by columnist [[Robert Novak]] as an "insistent reformer."<ref>Novak, Robert. "The Pork-as-Usual GOP". ''The Washington Post''. January 24, 2008. A4. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/23/AR2008012303286.html]</ref> He is a signer of the Taxpayer Protection Pledge<ref>[http://www.atr.org/current-taxpayer-protection-pledge-signers-th-a2851 Current Taxpayer Protection Pledge Signers]</ref> and one of eight House members to receive a 100% approval rating from the [[American Conservative Union]]. <ref>http://www.conservative.org/archive2/House_standout.asp</ref> Flake voted against the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] ("TARP"). <ref>Larison, Daniel (2011-02-10) [http://www.amconmag.com/larison/2011/02/10/kyl-will-not-be-missed/ Kyl Will Not Be Missed], ''[[The American Conservative]]''</ref> . 

A "scourge of [[Pork barrel|pork-barrel spending]],"<ref>Caldwell, Christopher (2007-07-22) [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/magazine/22Paul-t.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all The Antiwar, Anti-Abortion, Anti-Drug-Enforcement-Administration, Anti-Medicare Candidacy of Dr. Ron Paul], ''[[New York Times]]''</ref> Flake was ruled the least profligate spender in Congress by [[Citizens Against Government Waste]] in July 2007 and designated a "taxpayer superhero."<ref name="eastvalley"/>  In September 2010, Flake introduced a series of press releases under the title "So Just How Broke Are We?", whereby he explains the size of the national debt ($13 trillion) in terms of recent events, followed by a pun.  As an example, noting that the cheapest [[2010 World Series]] ticket on StubHub.com at [[AT&T Park]] was $425, it would take 30.6 billion tickets sold to pay down the debt, whereupon he remarked, ''"Looks like the voters are about to bring in some (debt) relievers."''<ref>http://flake.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=213126</ref> . 

;Earmarks
Flake is "known for his ardent opposition to [[Earmark (politics)|earmarks]]."<ref>Wilson, Reid and Friedman, Dan (2011-02-10) [http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2011/02/kyl-will-announ.php Kyl Won't Run Again], ''[[National Journal]]''</ref> He has been called an "anti-earmark crusader,"<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4HbcBboJuU "America's Newsroom". 'Fox News']</ref> and frequently challenges earmarks proposed by other members of Congress. Since May 2006, he has become prominent with the "Flake Hour," a tradition at the end of spending bill debates in which he asks earmark sponsors to come to the house floor and justify why taxpayers should pay for their "pet projects."<ref>Rogers, David. "Tilting at Appropriations". ''The Wall Street Journal''. June 29, 2006. A4. [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB115154369961993779.html]</ref> He is credited with prompting House rule changes to require [[Earmark (politics)|earmark]] sponsors to identify themselves. <ref>Kelly, Matt. "Congressman says earmarks could cost GOP power". ''USA Today''. 10/17/2006. [http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-10-17-flake-earmarks_x.htm]</ref>  . 

Until September 2010, Flake issued a press release listing an "egregious earmark of the week" every Friday. <ref name="eastvalley"/> Usually the earmark will be followed by Flake making a humorous comment; as an example, Rep. Flake once said of Congressman [[José Enrique Serrano|Jose Serrano's]] $150,000 earmark to fix plumbing in Italian restaurants, "I would argue this is one [[cannoli]] the taxpayer doesn’t want to take a bite of."<ref name="60minutes"/> The "earmark of the week" releases were ended and replaced with the "So Just How Broke Are We?" series of releases.  . 

In 2007, Flake was removed from the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]] for "bad behavior." According to one source, the group that made this decision was dominated by Appropriations members resentful of Flake's opposition to earmarks. <ref>[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/01/inside_report_democratic_disci.html RealClearPolitics - Articles - Inside Report: Democratic Discipline<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . 

In March, 2010, the House Appropriations Committee implemented rules to ban earmarks to for-profit corporations, a change Flake supported. “This is the best day we’ve had in a while,” he said to the ''[[New York Times]]'', which reported that approximately 1,000 such earmarks were authorized in the previous year, worth $1.7 billion. <ref>Eric Lichtblau, "[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/12/us/politics/12lobby.html New Earmark Rules Have Lobbyists Scrambling]", ''The New York Times'', March 11, 2010. </ref> . 

;Immigration
Flake has sponsored bills to increase legal immigration and establish a [[guest worker]] program. <ref>[http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/v26n3/cpr-26n3-4.pdf Immigration: President Bush’s Proposal], ''[[Cato Institute]]''</ref> Some episodes of Flake's work toward immigration reform in the mid-2000s were documented in the series ''How Democracy Works Now: Twelve Stories''.  . 

;Foreign policy
Flake initially supported the [[Iraq War]], but later changed his position to one of cautious opposition,<ref>Fickess, Jim (2007-02-22) [http://www.azcentral.com/community/gilbert/articles/0222gr-flakeiraq0222Z12.html?&wired Flake: Patience with Iraq waning], ''[[Arizona Republic]]''</ref> including voting against appropriations. At a 2008 congressional hearing featuring General [[David Petraeus]], Flake said: "I still have a hard time seeing the big picture and what constitutes success [in Iraq]. That's not just one side of the aisle with those kind of concerns. Many on this side of the aisle have that as well."<ref>[[Dana Milbank|Milbank, Dana]] (2008-04-10) [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/09/AR2008040903748.html From the GOP, the General Gets Unfriendly Fire], ''[[Washington Post]]''</ref> He also voted against President [[Barack Obama]]'s proposed [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)#Troop surge|troop surge]] in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]]. <ref>Abrams, Jim (2010-07-28) [http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2010/07/28/20100728WarFunding0728.html House OKs funds for Afghan surge], ''[[Associated Press]]''</ref> . 

Flake supports ending the [[United States embargo against Cuba|Cuba Trade Embargo]]<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImLSljbCGmg&feature=related Rep. Jeff Flake on US Cuba Policy: End the Embargo], ''[[Reason magazine|Reason.tv]]''</ref> and otherwise normalizing relations with Cuba. <ref>[[Steve Clemons|Clemons, Steve]] (2007-04-15) [http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/2007/04/15/jeff_flake_and_charlie_rangel/ Jeff Flake and Charlie Rangel Break Through Taboo of Exposing America's Failed Cuba Policy], ''[[Talking Points Memo]]''</ref> On February 8, 2011, Flake voted for renewal of the [[PATRIOT Act]]. <ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll026.xml]</ref> . 

;Social issues
In October 2008, ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' named Congressman Flake one of the Ten Best Members of Congress saying in part, "A true conservative, Flake is as rare as the dodo. Republicans should learn from him, and [[liberals]] and libertarians will find in him a strong privacy-rights ally."<ref>[http://www.esquire.com/features/esquire-endorsements-2008/10-best-members-congress-1108 "The 10 Best Members of Congress," Esquire Magazine. October 2008]</ref> . 

In December 2010, Flake was one of fifteen Republican House members to vote in favor of repealing the [[United States military]]'s "[[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]" ban on [[openly gay]] service members. <ref name=metro_weekly_20101215>Chris Geidner, [http://www.metroweekly.com/poliglot/2010/12/breaking-house-passes-dadt-rep.html House Passes DADT Repeal Bill], ''[[Metro Weekly]]'' (December 15, 2010). </ref><ref name=nytimes_20101215>[http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/111/house/2/638 House Vote 638 - Repeals 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell'], ''[[New York Times]]'' (December 15, 2010). </ref> Flake had voted to amend the U.S. Constitution to ban same-sex marriage with a [[Federal Marriage Amendment]] in 2004 and 2006. <ref>{{cite web|author=Clerk of the House|title=Final Vote Results For Roll Call 484|publisher=United States House of Representatives|date=September 30, 2004|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2004/roll484.xml|accessdate=February 14, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Clerk of the House|title=Final Vote Results For Roll Call 378|publisher=United States House of Representatives|date=July 18, 2006|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2006/roll378.xml|accessdate=February 14, 2011}}</ref> . 

;USA Patriot Act
During the 2005 debate on renewal of the expiring provisions of the Patriot Act, Jeff Flake successfully submitted several amendments to the bill in the House of Representatives. One required the FBI director to personally sign off on any request for library and bookstore records before applying to the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] but it was altered in the [[United States Senate]] version of the bill. <ref>http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-109hr3199enr/pdf/BILLS-109hr3199enr.pdf</ref> Two of his amendments were signed into law and they subjected any [[National Security Letter]] and its [[gag order]] to a judicial challenge by the recipient, and narrowed the scope of "Sneak and Peek" warrants to have definite time limits on their duration and extensions before they need to notify the target of the investigation. <ref>http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-3199&tab=amendments</ref> Before that "Sneak and Peek" warrants could be extended by the vague standard of not "unduly delaying trial" without any defined time limitation. <ref>http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/intel/RL33332.pdf</ref> This amended bill was titled the U.S.A Patriot Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 and it was signed into law on March 9, 2006. <ref>http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-3199</ref> This bill also required three [[Inspector General]] investigations that lead to the discovery of exigent letters<ref>http://www.mainjustice.com/2010/04/14/sensenbrenner-feels-betrayed-by-fbis-violations/</ref> and [[National Security Letter]] abuses. <ref>http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/intel/RS22406.pdf</ref> . 

On February 8, 2011 Jeff Flake voted to renew key provisions of the USA PATRIOT ACT. The vote failed. <ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll026.xml</ref>
On February 10, 2011 Jeff Flake again voted to renew key provisions of the USA PATRIOT ACT. This vote succeeded. <ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll029.xml</ref> .
