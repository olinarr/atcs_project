The '''United States Senate Committee on Appropriations''' is a [[standing committee]] of the [[United States Senate]]. It has jurisdiction over all [[discretionary spending]] [[legislation]] in the Senate. 
[[Image:W corr1 us capitol.jpg|thumb|200px|The entrance to the Senate Appropriations Committee in the [[United States Capitol]]]]
The Senate Appropriations Committee is the largest committee in the U.S. Senate, with 30 members at the end of the [[111th Congress]]. Its role is defined by the [[U.S. Constitution]], which requires "appropriations made by law" prior to the expenditure of any money from the Treasury, and is therefore one of the most powerful committees in the Senate.{{Ref|charter}} The committee was first organized on March 6, 1867, when power over appropriations was taken out of the hands of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Finance|Finance Committee]].{{Ref|history}} . 

The chairman of the Appropriations Committee has enormous power to bring home special projects (sometimes referred to as "[[Pork barrel|pork barrel spending]]") for his or her state as well as having the final say on other senators' appropriation requests.{{Ref|pork}} For example, in [[fiscal year]] 2005 [[per capita]] federal spending in Alaska, the home state of then-Chairman [[Ted Stevens]], was $12,000, double the national average. Alaska has 11,772 special earmarked projects for a combined cost of $15,780,623,000. This represents about 4% of the overall spending in the $388 billion Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005 passed by Congress.{{Ref|12k}} . 

==The appropriations process==. 
[[Image:GATES APPRO.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Former Committee Chairman [[Robert Byrd]] (D-WV, far right) shakes hands with Secretary of Defense [[Robert Gates]] while Sen. [[Patrick Leahy]] (D-VT, center right) and Sen. [[Tom Harkin]] (D-IA) look on. The hearing was held to discuss further funding for the [[War in Iraq]].]] . 

The federal budget is divided into two main categories: [[United States budget process#Discretionary vs. mandatory spending|discretionary spending and mandatory spending]]. Each appropriations subcommittee develops a draft [[appropriations bill]] covering each agency under its jurisdiction based on the [[United States budget process#Budget resolution|Congressional Budget Resolution]], which is drafted by an analogous Senate [[United States Senate Committee on Budget|Budget committee]]. Each subcommittee must adhere to the spending limits set by the budget resolution and allocations set by the full Appropriations Committee, though the full Senate may vote to waive those limits if 60 senators vote to do so. The committee also reviews supplemental spending bills (covering unforeseen or emergency expenses not previously budgeted).  . 

Each appropriations bill must be passed by both houses of [[United States Congress|Congress]] and signed by the president prior to the start of the federal fiscal year, October 1. If that target is not met, as has been common in recent years, the committee drafts a [[continuing resolution]], which is then approved by Congress and signed by the President to keep the federal government operating until the individual bills are approved.  . 

==Members, 112th Congress==. 
The Committee is currently chaired by [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] [[Daniel Inouye]] of [[Hawaii]], and the [[Ranking Member]] is [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] [[Thad Cochran]], of [[Mississippi]].  .

===Committee reorganization during the 110th Congress===. 
At the outset of the 110th Congress, Chairman Robert Byrd and Chairman [[Dave Obey]], his counterpart on the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Appropriations Committee]], developed a committee reorganization plan that provided for common subcommittee structures between both houses, a move that the both chairmen hope will allow Congress to "complete action on each of the government funding on time for the first time since 1994."{{Ref|sub}}{{Ref|sub2}} The subcommittees were last overhauled between the [[107th United States Congress|107th]] and [[108th United States Congress|108th Congresses]], after the creation of the [[United States Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security|Subcommittee on Homeland Security]] and again during the [[109th United States Congress|109th Congress]], when the number of subcommittees was reduced from 13 to 12.  . 

A key part of the new subcommittee organization was the establishment of a new [[United States Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government|Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government]], which consolidates funding for the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]], the [[United States federal courts|United States federal judiciary]], and the [[District of Columbia]]. These functions were previously handled by two separate Senate subcommittees.  .
