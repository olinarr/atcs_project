'''Socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor''' is a classical political-economic argument, <!-- the following sentence is commented-out, because according to the online-available links below, Marthin Luther King Jr., who was assassinated in 1968, had used such formulation in his speeches: ---- formulated around 1970,<ref>John Wykert1, Gerald M. Pomper2, 3 and David M. Gordon [http://www.springerlink.com/content/42306v75113724lh/ Society Volume 9, Number 3 / January, 1972]</ref>--> stating that in the [[advanced capitalist]] societies state policies assure that more resources flow to the rich than to the poor, for example in form of [[transfer payment]]s. The term [[corporate welfare]] is widely used to describe the bestowal of favorable treatment to particular corporations by the government. One of the most commonly raised forms of criticism are statements that the capitalist political economy toward large corporations allows them to "[[Privatizing profits and socializing losses|privatize profits and socialize losses]]."<ref>[http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/roubini/228924/ Stealth Public Bailout of Countrywide: Privatize profits and socialize losses], [[Nouriel Roubini]]</ref> The argument has been raised and cited on many occasions.  . 

== History and usage ==. 
{{globalize/USA|date=March 2011}}
The notion that banks privatize profits and socialize losses dates at least to the 19th century, as in this 1834 quote of [[Andrew Jackson]]:
{{quote
|I too have been a close observer of the doings of the Bank of the United States. I have had men watching you for a long time and I am convinced that you have used the funds of the bank to speculate in the breadstuffs of the country. When you won, you divided the profits amongst you, and when you lost, you charged it to the Bank. ... You are a den of vipers and thieves. 
|[[Andrew Jackson]] in 1834 on closing the [[Second Bank of the United States]]. <ref>From the original minutes of the Philadelphia committee of citizens sent to meet with President Jackson, February 1834, according to Stan V. Henkels, ''[[Andrew Jackson and the Bank of the United States]]'', 1928 ([[q:Andrew Jackson|unabridged form, extended citation]])</ref>}} . 

The phrase may have been first popularized by [[Michael Harrington]]'s 1962 book [[The Other America]]. <ref>Harrington 1962, p.170, quote: "socialism for the rich and private enterprise for the poor"</ref><ref>Robert P. Engvall (1996) ''[http://www.springerlink.com/content/c18j629841844765/ The connections between poverty discourse and educational reform: When did “Reform” become synonymous with inattention?]'' in [[The Urban Review]] Volume 28, Number 2 / June, 1996, pp. 141-163</ref> However, Harrington is actually citing [[Charles Abrams]],<ref>[[Michael Harrington]] (1962) [[The Other America]], p.58, quote: ''This is yet another case of "socialism for the rich and free enterprise for the poor," as described by Charles Abrams in the housing field''</ref> well-known authority on [[House|housing]].  . 

[[Andrew Young]] has been cited for calling the U.S. system  “socialism for the rich and free enterprise for the poor”, and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], who was assassinated in 1968, frequently used this wording in his speeches. <ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFDC113AF93BA25752C0A965958260&n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FPeople%2FK%2FKing%2C%20Martin%20Luther%20Jr. King's Light, Malcolm's Shadow], January 18, 1993</ref><ref>Thomas F.

In winter 2006/2007, in response to criticism about oil imports from Venezuela, that country being under the leadership of [[Hugo Chávez]], the founder and president of Citizens Energy Corporation [[Joseph P. Kennedy II]] countered with a critique of the U.S. system which he characterized as “a kind of socialism for the rich and free enterprise for the poor that leaves the most vulnerable out in the cold”. <ref>[http://www.metrowestdailynews.com/columnists/8998982778762559487 Kennedy: U.S. oil companies profit; Citgo helps the poor], MetroWest Daily News, January 24, 2007</ref> Also [[Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.]] has become known for expressing to large audiences that the United States is now a land of “socialism for the rich and brutal capitalism for the poor”. <ref>Mark Jacobson: [http://nymag.com/news/politics/27340 American Jeremiad], New York Magazine, February 5, 2007, see [http://nymag.com/news/politics/27340/index3.html page 4]</ref> . 

Economist [[Dean Baker]] expressed similar views in his book ''The Conservative Nanny State: How the Wealthy Use the Government to Stay Rich and Get Richer'', in which he pointed out several different policy areas in which government intervention is essential to preserving and enhancing wealth in the hands of a few. <ref>{{cite book

Also [[Noam Chomsky]] has criticized the way in which free market principles have been applied. He has argued that the wealthy use free-market rhetoric to justify imposing greater economic [[risk]] upon the lower classes, while being insulated from the rigours of the market by the political and economic advantages that such wealth affords. <ref>Takis Michas, "The Other Chomsky", ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', November 4, 2005. [http://www.chomsky.info/onchomsky/20051104.htm Reproduced on Chomsky's official site]. </ref> He remarked, "the free market is [[socialism]] for the [[wealthy|rich]]&mdash;[free] markets for the poor and state [[protectionism|protection]] for the rich."<ref>Noam Chomsky, "The Passion for Free Markets", ''[[Z Magazine]]'', May 1997. [http://www.chomsky.info/articles/199705--.htm Reproduced on Chomsky's official site]. </ref> . 

Arguments along a similar line were raised in connection with the financial turmoil in 2008. With regard to the [[federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac]], Ron Blackwell, chief economist of [[AFL-CIO]], used the expression “Socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor” to characterize the system. <ref>[http://www.consortiumnews.com/2008/071508b.html Fannie/Freddie's “Socialism for Rich”], July 15, 2008</ref> In September 2008, the US Senator from [[Vermont]], [[Democratic Socialist]] [[Bernie Sanders]] said regarding the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|bailout of the U.S. financial system]]: “This is the most extreme example that I can recall of socialism for the rich and free enterprise for the poor”. <ref>[http://sanders.senate.gov/news/record.cfm?id=303313 Sanders Op-Ed: Billions for Bailouts! Who Pays?], September 19, 2008</ref> The same month, economist [[Nouriel Roubini]] stated: “It is pathetic that Congress did not consult any of the many professional economists that have presented […] alternative plans that were more fair and efficient and less costly ways to resolve this crisis. This is again a case of privatizing the gains and socializing the losses; a bailout and socialism for the rich, the well-connected and Wall Street”. <ref>[[Nouriel Roubini]]: [http://www.rgemonitor.com/roubini-monitor/253783/is_purchasing_700_billion_of_toxic_assets_the_best_way_to_recapitalize_the_financial_system_no_it_is_rather_a_disgrace_and_rip-off_benefitting_only_the_shareholders_and_unsecured_creditors_of_banks Nouriel Roubini's Global EconoMonitor, September 28, 2008]</ref> . 

Former [[U.S.]] [[Secretary of Labor]] [[Robert Reich]] adapted this phrase on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' on October 16, 2008: "We have socialism for the rich, and capitalism for everyone else."<ref>Interview with Jon Stewart, ''The Daily Show'', Oct 16, 2008:  [http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=188622&title=Robert-Reich Available at ''The Daily Show'' Site]

The journalist [[John Pilger]] also included the phrase in his speech accepting Australia's human rights award, the [[Sydney Peace Prize]], on 5th November 2009: "Democracy has become a business plan, with a bottom line for every human activity, every dream, every decency, every hope. The main parliamentary parties are now devoted to the same economic policies - socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor - and the same foreign policy of servility to endless war. This is not democracy. It is to politics what [[McDonalds]] is to food."<ref>Full transcript of the John Pilger speech at the [[Sydney Opera House]] to mark his award of Australia's human rights prize, the Sydney Peace Prize: [http://www.johnpilger.com/page.asp?partid=555]</ref> . 

Vermont senator [[Bernie Sanders]] referenced the phrase during his eight-and-a-half-hour speech on the senate floor on December 10, 2010 against the continuation of Bush-era tax cuts, when speaking on the [[Troubled_Asset_Relief_Program|federal bailout of major financial institutions]] at a time when small-businesses were being denied loans. <ref>http://www.c-span.org/Events/Sen-Sanders-Held-a-Tax-Cut-Filibuster/20338/</ref> .
