{{Main|Lobbying}}
'''Lobbying in the United States''' describes paid activity in which special interests hire well-connected professional advocates, often lawyers, to argue for specific legislation in decision-making bodies such as the [[United States Congress]]. It is a highly controversial phenomenon, often seen in a negative light by journalists and the American public, and frequently misunderstood. <ref name=twsN411>{{cite news

}}</ref> While lobbying is subject to extensive and often complex rules which, if not followed, can lead to penalties including jail, the activity of lobbying has been interpreted by court rulings as [[free speech]] and protected by the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. Since the 1970s, lobbying activity has grown immensely in terms of the numbers of lobbyists and the size of lobbying budgets, and has become the focus of much criticism of American governance. Since lobbying rules require extensive disclosure, there is a wealth of data in the [[public sphere]] about which entities lobby, how, at whom, and for how much. The current pattern suggests much lobbying is done by corporations although a wide variety of coalitions representing diverse groups is possible. Lobbying happens at every level of government, including federal, state, county, municipal, and even local governments. In Washington, lobbying usually targets congresspersons, although there have been efforts to influence executive agency officials as well as Supreme Court appointments. It has been the subject of academic inquiry in various fields, including law, public policy, and economics. While the number of lobbyists in Washington is over nine thousand, those with real clout number in the dozens, and a small group of firms handles much of lobbying in terms of expenditures. As an activity, lobbying takes time to learn, and requires skill and sensitivity, and depends on the deft persuasion, and has much in common with generally non-political activities such as [[management consulting]] and [[public relations]].  . 

==Overview==. 
Political scientist [[Thomas R. Dye]] once said that [[politics]] is about battling over scarce governmental resources: who gets them, where, when, why and how. <ref name=twsL18/> Since government makes the rules in a complex economy such as the [[United States]], it is logical that various organizations, businesses, individuals, nonprofits, trade groups, religions, charities and others—which are affected by these rules—will exert as much influence as they can to have rulings favorable to their cause. And the battling for influence has happened in every organized society since the beginning of civilization, whether it was [[Ancient Athens]], Florence during the time of the [[House of Medici|Medici]], [[Late Imperial China]], and the present-day [[United States]]. Modern-day lobbyists in one sense are like the [[courtier]]s of the [[Ancien Régime]]. If [[voting]] is a general way for a public to control a government, lobbying is a more specific, targeted effort, focused on a narrower set of issues. <ref name=twsN411/> .

The term ''[[lobbying|lobby]]'' has etymological roots in the physical structure of the British Parliament, in which there was an intermediary covered room outside the main hall. People pushing an agenda would try to meet with members of Parliament in this room, and they came to be known, by [[metonymy]], as ''lobbyists'', although one account in 1890 suggested that the application of the word "lobby" is American and that the term is not used as much in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. <ref name=twsN512>{{cite news

The term ''lobbying'' in everyday parlance can describe a wide variety of actions, and in its general sense, suggests advocacy, advertising, or promoting a cause. In this sense, anybody who tries to influence any political position can be thought of as "lobbying", and sometimes the term is used in this loose sense. A person who writes a letter to a congressperson, or even questions a candidate at a political meeting, could be construed as being a ''lobbyist''. <ref name=twsL16>{{cite news

However, the term "lobbying" is generally used in the [[public sphere]] to describe a paid activity with the purpose of attempting to "influence or sway" a public official, including bureaucrats as well as elected officials, towards a desired specific action often relating to specific legislation. <ref name=twsL19/> If ''advocacy'' is disseminating information, including attempts to educate public officials as well as the public and media, to plead the cause of something and support it,<ref name=twsL19/> then when this activity becomes focused on specific legislation, either in support or in opposition, then it crosses the line from ''advocacy'' and becomes ''lobbying''. <ref name=twsL19/> This is the usual sense in mainstream media. One account suggested that much of the activity of [[nonprofit organization|nonprofits]] was not ''lobbying'' per se, since it usually did not mean changes in legislation. <ref name=twsL19/> . 

A lobbyist, according to the legal sense of the word, is a professional, often a lawyer. Lobbyists are intermediaries between client organizations and lawmakers: they explain to legislators what their organizations want, and they explain to their clients what obstacles elected officials face. One definition of a lobbyist is someone "employed to persuade legislators to pass legislation that will help the lobbyist's employer."<ref name=twsN511>{{cite news

}}</ref> Generally, an elected official who tries to persuade another elected official to adopt a particular position is not considered as a lobbyist in the usual sense, although one could make a case that one official was ''lobbying'' another. In addition, there is a sense in which the term ''lobbyist'' is too limiting in that it fails to convey the power and influence of persons who advise public officials; in this sense, these people have many roles, including being "influence peddlers, campaign contributors and fundraisers, political advisers, restaurateurs, benefactors of local cultural and charitable institutions, country gentlemen and more," according to one view. <ref name=twsM33fsa/> A lobbyist may put together a diverse coalition of organizations and people, sometimes including lawmakers and corporations, and the whole effort may be considered to be a ''lobby''; for example, in the abortion issue, there is a "pro-choice lobby" and a "pro-life lobby".  . 

In 2007, according to one estimate, there were more than 17,000 federal lobbyists based in [[Washington, DC]]. <ref>{{cite book |title=Washington Representatives

==Different types of lobbying==. 
===The focus of lobbying efforts===. 
Generally, lobbyists focus their energies on trying to persuade decision-makers: Congress, executive branch agencies such as the Treasury Department and the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]],<ref name=twsN111/> the Supreme Court,<ref name=twsL28/> state governments (including governors). Federal agencies have been targeted by lobbyists since they write industry-specific rules; accordingly, interest groups spend "massive sums of money" trying to persuade them to make so-called "carve-outs" or try to block specific provisions from being enacted. <ref name=twsL37/> A large fraction of overall lobbying happens only a few sets of issues, according to one report. <ref name=twsL12/> It is possible for one level of government to lobby another level; for example, the [[District of Columbia]], seeking better voting rights for its citizens, has been lobbying Congress and the president for greater power including possible statehood or voting representation in Congress; one assessment in 2011 suggested that the district needed to rethink its lobbying strategy, since its past efforts have only had "mixed results". <ref name=twsN112>{{cite news

}}</ref> Since the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has the power of [[judicial review]] and can render a congressional law unconstitutional, it has great power to influence the course of American life. For example, in the [[Roe v Wade]] decision, it ruled on the legality of [[abortion]]. A variety of forces use lobbying tactics to pressure the court to overturn this decision.  .

===Paid versus free lobbying===. 
While the bulk of lobbying happens by business and professional interests who hire paid professionals, some lobbyists represent non-profits [[pro-bono]] for issues in which they are personally interested. [[Pro bono publico]] clients offer activities to meet and socialize with local legislators on neutral territory like fundraisers and awards ceremonies.  . 

===Single issue versus multiple issue lobbying===. 
Lobbies which push for a single issue have grown in importance during the past twenty years, according to one source. <ref name=twsL16/> Corporations generally would be considered as ''single issue'' lobbies. If a corporation wishes to change public policy, or to influence legislation which impacts its success as a business, it may use lobbying as a "primary avenue" for this purpose. <ref name=twsM214>{{cite news

===Inside versus outside lobbying===. 
* '''Inside lobbying''', or sometimes called ''direct lobbying'', describes efforts by lobbyists to influence legislation or rule-making directly by contacting legislators and their assistants, sometimes called staffers or aides.  . 

* '''Outside lobbying''', or sometimes ''indirect lobbying'', includes attempts by interest group leaders to mobilize citizens outside the policymaking community, perhaps by [[public relations]] methods or [[advertising]], to prompt them to pressure public officials within the policymaking community. <ref name=twsL17/> One example of an outside lobbying effort is a film entitled ''InJustice'', made by a group promoting lawsuit reform. <ref name=twsM43>{{cite news

* '''Law firms'''. Several law firms had sizeable departments devoted to so-called "government relations", and these included firms such as [[Patton Boggs]], [[Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld|Akin Gump]] and [[Holland & Knight]]. <ref name=twsL42/> One account suggested that the lobbying arms of these law firms were not held as separate subsidiaries, but that the law practices involved in government lobbying were integrated into the overall framework of the law firm. <ref name=twsL42/> A benefit to an integrated arrangement was that the law firm and the lobbying department could "share and refer clients back and forth". <ref name=twsL42/> Generally, law firms tend to bill for lobbying in the same way they bill other clients: by billable hour, although there was a report that Holland & Knight was considering shifting to a retainer basis of payment. <ref name=twsL34>{{cite news

* '''Lobbying firms'''. These firms usually have some lawyers in them, and are often founded by former congressional staffers, legislators, or other politicians. One report suggested that lobbyists prefer to be paid according to a "fixed fee", not to be paid according to an hourly billing arrangement, and that many chose not to work for big law firms to avoid the billable hour arrangement. <ref name=twsL42/> Some lobbying groups have been bought by large advertising conglomerates, such as [[Interpublic Group of Companies|InterPublic Group]]. <ref name=twsM33fsa/> . 

====Corporations====. 
Corporations which lobby actively tend to be few in number, large, and often sell to the government. Most corporations do not hire lobbyists. One study found that the actual number of firms which do lobbying regularly is fewer than 300, and that the percent of firms engaged in lobbying was 10% from 1998&ndash;2006,<ref name=twsM214/> and that they were "mainly large, rich firms getting in on the fun."<ref name=twsM21/> These firms hired lobbyists year after year, and there was not much evidence of other large firms taking much interest in lobbying. <ref name=twsM21/> Corporations considering lobbying run into substantial barriers to entry: corporations have to research the relevant laws about lobbying, hire lobbying firms, and cultivate influential people and make connections. <ref name=twsM21/><ref>Salamon, Lester M, and John J Siegfried (1977), “Economic Power and Political Influence: The Impact of Industry Structure on Public Policy,” American Political Science Review 71. </ref><ref>Masters, Marick F, and Gerald D Keim (1985), “Determinants of PAC Participation Among Large Corporations,” Journal of Politics 47. </ref><ref>Bombardini, Matilde (2008), “Firm Heterogeneity and Lobby Participation,” Journal of International Economics 75</ref> When an issue regarding a change in immigration policy arose, large corporations currently lobbying switched focus somewhat to take account of the new regulatory world, but that new corporations—even ones likely to be affected by any possible rulings on immigration—stayed out of the lobbying fray, according to the study. <ref name=twsM214/> .

====Other players====. 
Other possible players in the lobbying arena are those who might influence legislation: House & Senate colleagues, public opinion in the district, the White House, party leaders, union leaders, and other influential persons and groups. <ref name=twsL17/> Interest groups are often thought of as "nonparty organizations" which regularly try to change or influence government decision-making. <ref name=twsL17/> . 

===Lobbying methods and techniques===. 
Lobbying has much in common with highly people-intensive businesses such as [[management consulting]] and [[public relations]], but with a political and legal sensibility. Like lawmakers, many lobbyists are lawyers, and the persons they are trying to influence have the duty of writing laws. That the disciplines of law and lobbying are intertwined could be seen in the case of a Texas lawyer who had been seeking compensation for his unfairly imprisoned client; since his exonerated-prisoner client had trouble paying the legal expenses, the lawyer lobbied the Texas state legislature to raise the state's payment for unfairly imprisoned prisoners from $50,000 per year to $80,000 per year; it succeeded, making it possible for his newly freed client to pay the lawyer's fees. <ref name=twsM213>{{cite news

Well-connected lobbyists work in Washington for years, know the issues, are highly skilled advocates,<ref name=twsL13/> and have cultivated close connections with members of Congress, regulators, specialists, and others. They understand strategy and have excellent communication skills; many are well suited to be able to choose which clients they would like to represent. <ref name=twsL13/> Lobbyists patiently cultivate networks of powerful people, over many years, trying to build trust and maintain confidence and friendships. When a client hires them to push a specific issue or agenda, they usually form coalitions to exert political pressure. <ref name=twsL16/> Lobbying, as a result, depends on trying to be flexible to new opportunities, but at the same time, to act as an agent for a client. As one lobbyist put it: .

When getting access is difficult, there are ways to wear down the walls surrounding a legislator. [[Jack Abramoff]] explained: . 

::{{Quote|Access is vital in lobbying. If you can't get in your door, you can't make your case. Here we had a hostile senator, whose staff was hostile, and we had to get in. So that's the lobbyist safe-cracker method: is throw fundraisers, raise money, and become a big donor.|Lobbyist [[Jack Abramoff]] in 2011<ref name=twsM13/>}} . 

Lobbyists often assist congresspersons with [[campaign finance]]<ref name=twsL13/> by arranging fundraisers, assembling PACs,<ref name=twsM214/><ref name=twsM33fsa/> and seeking donations from other clients. Many lobbyists become campaign treasurers and fundraisers for congresspersons. This helps incumbent members cope with the substantial amounts of time required to raise money for reelection bids; one estimate was that congresspersons had to spend a third of their working hours on fundraising activity. <ref name=twsM33fsa/> PACs are fairly easy to set up; it requires a lawyer and about $300, roughly. <ref name=twsL16/> An even steeper possible reward which can be used in exchange for favors is the lure of a high-paying job as a lobbyist; according to Jack Abramoff, one of the best ways to "get what he wanted" was to offer a high-ranking congressional aide a high-paying job after they decided to leave public office. <ref name=twsM111/> When such a promise of future employment was accepted, according to Abramoff, "we owned them". <ref name=twsM111/> This helped the lobbying firm exert influence on that particular congressperson by going through the staff member or aide. At the same time, it is hard for outside observers to argue that a particular decision, such as hiring a former staffer into a lobbying position, was purely as a reward for some past political decision, since staffers often have valuable connections and policy experience needed by lobbying firms. <ref name=twsM45/> Research economist Mirko Draca suggested that hiring a staffer was an ideal way for a lobbying firm to try to sway their old bosses—a congressperson—in the future. <ref name=twsM45/> . 

Lobbyists, according to several sources, strive for communications which are clear, straightforward, and direct. <ref name=twsL13/> In a one-on-one meeting with a lobbyist, it helps to understand precisely what goal is wanted. <ref name=twsL16/> A lobbyist wants action on a bill; a legislator wants to be re-elected. <ref name=twsL14/> The idea is to persuade a legislator that what the lobbyist wants is good public policy. <ref name=twsL17/> Lobbyists often urge lawmakers to try to persuade other lawmakers to approve a bill. <ref name=twsL14/> . 

[[File:Robert Byrd official portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Senator [[Robert Byrd]] in 2005.]]
Still, persuasion is a subtle business, requiring a deft touch, and carelessness can boomerang. <ref name=twsL17/> In one instance of a public relations reversal, a lobbying initiative by the Cassidy firm which targeted Senator [[Robert C. Byrd]] blew up when the Cassidy-Byrd connection was published in the ''[[Washington Post]]''; this resulted in a furious Byrd reversing his previous pro-Cassidy position and throwing a "theatrical temper tantrum" regarding an $18 million facility. <ref name=twsM33>{{cite news

Since it often takes a long time to build the network of relationships within the lobbying industry, ethical interpersonal dealings are important. A maxim in the industry is for lobbyists to be truthful with people they are trying to persuade; one lobbyist described it this way: "what you've basically got is your word and reputation". <ref name=twsL13/> An untruth, a lie is too risky to the successful development of a long-term relationship and is not worth it. <ref name=twsL13/> One report suggested that below-the-belt tactics generally do not work. <ref name=twsL16/> One account suggest that groping for "personal dirt" on opponents was counterproductive since it would undermine respect for the lobbyist and their clients. <ref name=twsL16/> And, by reverse logic, if an untruth is told by an opponent or opposing lobby, then it makes sense to publicize it. <ref name=twsL16/> But the general code among lobbyists is that unsubstantiated claims are bad business. <ref name=twsL16/> Even worse is planting an informant in an opponent's camp, since if this subterfuge is ever discovered, it will boomerang negatively in a hundred ways, and credibility will drop to zero. <ref name=twsL16/> The importance of personal relationships in lobbying can be seen in the state of [[Illinois]], in which father-son ties helped push a smart-grid energy bill, although there were accusations of favoritism. <ref name=twsL33>{{cite news

Strategic considerations for lobbyists, trying to influence legislation, include "locating a power base" or a constituency logically predisposed to support a given policy. <ref name=twsL14/> Timing, as well, is usually important, in the sense of knowing when to propose a certain action and having a big-picture view of the possible sequence of desired actions. <ref name=twsL17/> Strategic lobbying tries to estimate the possible responses of different groups to a possible lobby approach; one study suggested that the "expectations of opposition from other interests" was a key factor helping to determine how a lobby should operate. <ref name=twsL26>{{cite news

}}</ref> Interest groups try to build "sustainable coalitions of similarly situated individual organizations in pursuit of like-minded goals". <ref name=twsL19/> According to one study, it is often difficult for a lobbyist to influence a staff member in Congress directly, since staffers tend to be well-informed and subject to views from competing interests. As an indirect tactic, lobbyists can try to manipulate [[public opinion]] which, in turn, can sometimes exert pressure on congresspersons. <ref name=twsL13/> Activities for these purposes include trying to use the mass media, cultivating contacts with reporters and editors, encouraging them to write editorials and cover stories to influence public opinion, which may have the secondary effect of influencing Congress. <ref name=twsL13/> According to analyst Ken Kollman, it is easier to sway public opinion than a congressional staff member since it is possible to bombard the public with "half-truths, distortion, scare tactics, and misinformation."<ref name=twsL13/> Kollman suggests there should be two goals: (1) communicate that there is public support behind an issue to policymakers and (2) increase public support for the issue among constituents. <ref name=twsL17/> Kollman suggested outside lobbying was a "powerful tool" for interest group leaders. <ref name=twsL17>{{cite news

Lobbying today generally requires mounting a coordinated campaign, using targeted blitzes of telephone calls, letters, emails to congressional lawmakers, marches down the [[Washington Mall]], bus caravans, and such, and these are often put together by lobbyists who coordinate a variety of interest group leaders to unite behind a hopefully simple easy-to-grasp and persuasive message. <ref name=twsL17/> . 

[[File:Abramoff scotland3.jpg|thumb|right|Lobbyists. Left to right: [[Jack Abramoff]], golf organizer Jason Murdoch, former Christian Coalition leader [[Ralph E. Reed, Jr.|Ralph Reed]], convicted former Bush administration official [[David Safavian]], and [[Bob Ney]].]]
Gifts for congresspersons and staffers can be problematic, since anything of sizeable value must be disclosed and generally such gifts are illegal. <ref name=twsM111/> Failure to observe gift restrictions was one factor which caused lobbyist [[Jack Abramoff]] to eventually plead guilty to a "raft of federal corruption charges" and led to convictions for 20 lobbyists and public officials, including congressperson [[Bob Ney]] and [[George W. Bush|Bush]] deputy interior secretary [[J. Steven Griles|Stephen Griles]]. <ref name=twsM111/> . 

Wealthy lobbyists often encourage other lobbying clients to donate to a particular cause, in the hope that favors will be returned at a later date. Lobbyist [[Gerald Cassidy]] encouraged other clients to give for causes dear to a particular client engaged in a current lobbying effort. <ref name=twsM33/> Some lobbyists give their own money: Cassidy reportedly donated a million dollars on one project, according to one report, which noted that Cassidy's firm received "many times that much in fees from their clients" paid in monthly retainers. <ref name=twsM33/> And their clients, in turn, had received "hundreds of millions in earmarked appropriations" and benefits worth "hundreds of millions more". <ref name=twsM33/> . 

It is important for lobbyists to follow rules governing lobbying behavior. These can be difficult and complex, take time to learn, require full disclosure,<ref name=twsL13/> and mistakes can land a lobbyist in serious legal trouble. Generally gifts to congresspersons or their staffs or federal officials are not allowed, but with a few exceptions: books are permitted, provided that the inside cover is inscribed with the congressperson's name and the name of one's organization. <ref name=twsL16/> Gifts under $5 are allowed. <ref name=twsL16/> Another exception is awards, so it is permitted to give a congressperson a plaque thanking him or her for support on a given issue. <ref name=twsL16/> Cash gifts payable by check only can only be made to campaign committees, not to a candidate personally or to his or her staff; it is not permitted to give cash or stock. <ref name=twsL16/>  . 

The dynamics of the lobbying world make it fairly easy for a semi-skilled operator to defraud a client. This is essentially what happened in the [[Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal]]. There was a concerned client—in this case, an [[Native American gaming|Indian casino]]—worried about possible ill-effects of legislation on its gambling business; and there were lobbyists such as [[Jack Abramoff]] who knew how to exploit these fears. The lobbyists actively lobbied ''against'' their own casino-client as a way to ratchet up their fears of adverse legislation as well as stoke possible future contributions; the lobbyists committed other violations such as grossly overbilling their clients as well as violating rules about giving gifts to congresspersons. Numerous persons went to jail after the scandal. The following are factors which can make fraud a fairly easy-to-do activity: that lobbyists are paid only to ''try to'' influence decision-makers, and may or may not succeed, making it hard to tell if a lobbyist did actual work;<ref name=twsL13/> that much of what happens regarding interpersonal relations is obscure despite rather strict disclosure and transparency requirements; that there are sizable monies involved—factors such as these almost guarantee that there will be future scandals involving fraudulent lobbying activity, according to one assessment. A fraud similar to Abramoff's was perpetuated in [[Maryland]] by lobbyist Gerald E. Evans, who was convicted of mail and wire fraud in 2000 in a case involving falsely creating a "fictitious legislative threat" against a client, and then billing the client to work against this supposed threat. <ref name=twsL32xx>{{cite news

Lobbyists routinely monitor how congressional officials vote, sometimes checking the past voting records of congresspersons. <ref name=twsL16/> One report suggested that reforms requiring "publicly recorded committee votes" were not used much by news media or voters but rather helped lobbyists were voting as they had promised earlier. <ref name=twsW11/> As a general rule, candidates and lawmakers must vote as a particular interest group wishes them to vote, or risk losing support. <ref name=twsL16/> . 

Strategy usually dictates targeting specific office holders. On the state level, one study suggested that much of the lobbying activity targeted the offices of governors as well as state-level executive bureaucrats; state lobbying was an "intensely personal game" with face-to-face contact being required for important decisions. <ref name=twsL27>{{cite news

===Lobbyists as educators and advisors===. 
Since government has grown increasingly complex, having to deal with new technologies, the task of writing rules has become more complex. "Government has grown so complex that it is a virtual certainty that more than one agency would be affected by any piece of legislation," according to one view. <ref name=twsL16/> Lobbyists, therefore, spend considerable time learning the ins and outs of issues, and can use their expertise to educate lawmakers<ref name=twsN115/> and help them cope with difficult issues. <ref name=twsL19/> Lobbyists' knowledge has been considered to be an intellectual subsidy for lawmakers. <ref> RICHARD L. HALL and ALAN V. DEARDORFF (2006). Lobbying as Legislative Subsidy. American Political Science Review, 100 , pp 69-84 doi:10.1017/S0003055406062010</ref><ref name=twsN115/> Some lobbyists become specialists with expertise in a particular set of issues, although one study suggested that of two competing criteria for lobbyists—expertise or access—that access was far more important. <ref name=twsM214/><ref>Bertrand, Marianne, Matilde Bombardini, and Francesco Trebbi (2011), “Is It Whom You Know or What You Know? An Empirical Assessment of the Lobbying Process,” University of British Columbia Working Paper. </ref><ref>Blanes i Vidal, Jordi, Mirko Dracaz, and Christian Fons-Rosen (2011), “Revolving Door Lobbyists,” London School of Economics Working Paper. </ref> . 

[[Lobby groups]] and their members sometimes also write legislation and [[Whip (politics)|whip]] bills, and in these instances, it is helpful to have lawyers skilled in writing legislation to assist with these efforts. <ref name=twsL16/> It is often necessary to research relevant laws and issues beforehand. <ref name=twsN411/> In many instances lobbyists write the actual text of the proposed law, and hire lawyers to "get the language down pat"—an omission in wording or an unclear phrase may open up a loophole for opponents to wrangle over for years. <ref name=twsL16/> And lobbyists can often advise a lawmaker on how to navigate the approval process. <ref name=twsN115/> . 

Lobbying firms can serve as mentors and guides. For example, after months of protesting by the [[Occupy Wall Street]], one lobbying firm prepared a memo to its clients warning that Republicans may "turn on big banks, at least in public" which may have the effect of "altering the political ground for years to come."<ref name=twsL43>{{cite news

Since the 1970s, there has been explosive growth in the lobbying industry, particularly in [[Washington D.C.]]. By 2011, one estimate of overall lobbying spending nationally was $30+ billion dollars. <ref name=twsM18/> An estimate of lobbying expenses in the federal arena was $3.5 billion in 2010, while it had been only $1.4 billion in 1998. <ref name=twsJanQ2ww3/> And there is prodigious data since firms are required to disclose lobbying expenditures on a quarterly basis.  . 

The industry, however, is not immune to economic downturns. If Congress is gridlocked, such as during the summer and early fall of 2011, lobbying activity dipped considerably, according to ''[[The Washington Post]]''. <ref name=twsM63>{{cite news

A sea-change in government, such as a shift in control of the legislature from one political party to the other, can affect the lobbying business profoundly. For example, the primarily Democratic-serving lobbying firm [[Cassidy & Associates]] learned that control of Congress would change hands from Democrats to Republicans in 1994, and the firm acquired Republican lobbyists before the congressional handover of power, and the move helped the lobbying firm stay on top of the new political realities. <ref name=twsM33ljjk>{{cite news

===Examples of lobbying===. 
There are numerous examples of lobbying activity reported by the media. One report chronicled a somewhat unusual alliance of consumer advocates and industry groups to boost funding for the [[Food and Drug Administration]]; the general pattern of lobbying efforts had been to try to reduce the regulatory oversight of such an agency. In this case, however, lobbying groups wanted the federal watchdog agency to have tougher policing authority to avert expensive problems when oversight was lax; in this case, industry and consumer groups were in harmony, and lobbyists were able to persuade officials that higher FDA budgets were in the public interest. <ref name=twsM15>{{cite news

===Effectiveness of lobbying===. 
[[File:USCurrency Federal Reserve.jpg|thumb|right|There is general agreement that money is a key variable in lobbying.]]
The general consensus view is that lobbying generally works overall in achieving sought-after results for clients, particularly since it has become so prevalent with substantial and growing budgets, although there are dissenting views. A study by the investment-research firm Strategas which was cited in ''[[The Economist]]'' and the ''[[Washington Post]]'' compared the 50 firms that spent the most on lobbying relative to their assets, and compared their financial performance against that of the [[S&P 500]] in the stock market; the study concluded that spending on lobbying was a "spectacular investment" yielding "blistering" returns comparable to a high-flying hedge fund, even despite the financial downturn of the past few years. <ref name=twsM23>{{cite news

Still, effectiveness can vary depending on the situational context. One view is that large multiple-issue lobbies tend to be effective in getting results for their clients if they are sophisticated, managed by a legislative director familiar with the art of compromise, and play "political hardball". <ref name=twsL16/> But if such lobbies became too big, such as large industrial trade organizations, they became harder to control, often leading to lackluster results. <ref name=twsL16/> A study in 2001 which compared lobbying activity in US-style congressional versus European-style parliamentary systems, found that in congressional systems there was an advantage favoring the "agenda-setters", but that in both systems, "lobbying has a marked effect on policies". <ref name=twsL24>{{cite news

Studies of lobbying by academics in previous decades painted a picture of lobbying being an ineffectual activity, although many of these studies were done before lobbying became prevalent in American politics. A study in 1963 by by Bauer, Pool, & Dexter suggested lobbyists were mostly "impotent" in exerting influence. <ref name=twsL17/> Studies in the early 1990s suggested that lobbying exerted influence only "marginally", although it suggested that when lobbying activity did achieve political impacts, that the results of the political choices were sufficient to justify the expenditure on lobbying. <ref name=twsL17/> A fairly recent study in 2009 is that Washington lobbies are "far less influential than political rhetoric suggests", and that most lobbying campaigns do not change any views and that there was a strong entrenchment of the [[status quo]]. <ref name=twsL12>{{cite news

There is anecdotal evidence from numerous newspaper accounts of different groups battling that lobbying activity usually achieves results. For example, the [[Barack Obama|Obama]] administration pledged to stop for-profit colleges from "luring students with false promises", but with this threat, the lobbying industry sprang into action with a $16 million campaign, and their efforts succeeded in watering down the proposed restrictions. <ref name=twsM14>{{cite news

Lobbying is a practical necessity for firms that "live and die" by government decisions, such as large government contractors such as Boeing. A study done in 2006 by ''[[Bloomberg News]]'' suggested that lobbying was a "sound money-making strategy" for the 20 largest federal contractors. The largest contractor, Lockheed Martin Corporation, received almost $40 billion in federal contracts in 2003-4, and spent $16 million on lobbying expenses and campaign donations. <ref name=twsM23/> For each dollar of lobbying investment, the firm received $2,517 in revenues, according to the report. <ref name=twsM23/> When the lobbying firm [[Cassidy & Associates]] began achieving results with earmarks for colleges and universities and medical centers, new lobbying firms rose to compete with them to win "earmarks of their own", a clear sign that the lobbying was exceedingly effective. <ref name=twsM33fsa/> . 

==Lobbying controversies==. 
Lobbying has been the subject of much debate and discussion. There is general consensus that lobbying has been a significant [[Political corruption|corrupting influence]] in American politics, although criticism is not universal, and there have been arguments put forward to suggest that the system is working properly.  . 

===Negative image===. 
Generally the image of lobbyists and lobbying in the [[public sphere]] is not a positive one, although this is not a universal sentiment. Lobbyists have been described as a "hired gun" without principles or positions. <ref name=twsL13/> Scandals involving lobbying have helped taint the image of the profession, such as ones involving Jack Abramoff, Randy "Duke" Cunningham, and Bob Nye and others, and which featured words such as "bribery", "lobbyist", "member of Congress" and "prison" tending to appear together in the same articles. <ref name=twsL18/> Negative publicity can sully lobbying's image to a great extent: high-profile cases of lobbying fraud such as Abramoff's;<ref name=twsL18/> dubious father-son exchange-of-favors ties;<ref name=twsL33/> public officials such as [[Newt Gingrich]] being accused and then denying accusations of having done lobbying and earning $1.6 million from "strategic advice". <ref name=twsL35>{{cite news

===Revolving door===. 
[[File:HK 中環 Central 中國銀行大廈 Bank of China Building front door 旋轉門 revolving door June-2010.JPG|thumb|right|The image of a revolving door has been used to describe the relation between working in government and for lobbyists.]]
Since the 1980s, congresspersons and staffers have been "going downtown" -- becoming lobbyists -- and the big draw is money. <ref name=twsN113/> The "lucrative world of K Street" means that former congresspersons with even "modest seniority" can move into jobs paying $1 million or more annually, without including bonuses for bringing in new clients. <ref name=twsN113>{{cite news

}}</ref> The general concern of this revolving-door activity is that elected officials—persons who were supposed to represent the interests of citizens—have instead become entangled with the big-money interests of for-profit corporations and interest groups with narrow concerns, and that public officials have been taken over by private interests. <ref name=twsW11/> . 

In July 2005, [[Public Citizen]] published a report entitled "The Journey from Congress to [[K Street (Washington, D.C.)|K Street]]": the report analyzed hundreds of lobbyist registration documents filed in compliance with the [[Lobbying Disclosure Act]] and the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]] among other sources. It found that since 1998, 43 percent of the 198 members of Congress who left government to join private life have registered to lobby. A similar report from the [[Center for Responsive Politics]] found 370 former members were in the "influence-peddling business", with 285 officially registered as federal lobbyists, and 85 others who were described as providing "strategic advice" or "public relations" to corporate clients. <ref name=twsN113/> ''[[The Washington Post]]'' described these results as reflecting the "sea change that has occurred in lawmakers' attitudes toward lobbying in recent years." The report included a [[case study]] of one particularly successful lobbyist, [[Bob Livingston]], who stepped down as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker-elect]] and resigned his seat in 1999. In the six years since his resignation, [[The Livingston Group]] grew into the 12th largest non-law lobbying firm, earning nearly $40 million by the end of 2004. During roughly the same time period, Livingston, his wife, and his two [[political action committee]]s (PACs) contributed over $500,000 to the campaign funds of various candidates.  . 

Numerous reports chronicle the ''revolving door'' phenomenon. <ref name=twsL13/> A 2011 estimate suggested that nearly 5,400 former congressional staffers had become federal lobbyists over a ten-year period, and 400 lawmakers made a similar jump. <ref name=twsM45>{{cite news

{{Quote|In a lot of areas, the stakes are between big companies, and it's hard to argue that one solution is better than another solution with regard to the consumer's interest ... The issue ... is whether Company A's solution, or Company B's solution, based on their technology or their footprint, is the right one.|Lobbyist Gerald Cassidy<ref name=twsM33fsa/>}} . 

A related but slightly different criticism is that the problem with lobbying as it exists today is that it creates an "inequity of access to the decision-making process". <ref name=twsL19/> As a result, important needs get left out of the political evaluation, such that there are no anti-hunger lobbies or lobbies seeking serious solutions to the problem of poverty. <ref name=twsM33fsa/> Nonprofit advocacy has been "conspicuously absent" from lobbying efforts, according to one view. <ref name=twsL19/> Critics suggest that when a powerful coalition battles a less powerful one, or one which is poorly connected or underfunded, the result may be seen as unfair and potentially harmful for the entire society. The increasing number of former lawmakers becoming lobbyists has led Senator [[Russ Feingold]] (D-WI) to propose paring back the many [[Capitol Hill]] privileges enjoyed by former senators and representatives. His plan would deprive lawmakers-turned-lobbyists of privileges such as unfettered access to otherwise "members only" areas such as the House and Senate floors and the House gym.  . 

===Decision-making issues===. 
[[File:Sign of the Times-Foreclosure.jpg|thumb|right|Studies have linked problems in the housing industry with lobbying efforts.]]
A concern among many critics is that influence peddling hurts overall decision making, according to this criticism. Proposals with merit are dropped in favor of proposals backed by political expediency. <ref name=twsL19/> An example cited in the media is the recent battling between food industry lobbyists and healthcare lobbyists regarding school lunches. A group supported by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] proposed healthier lunches as a way to combat [[childhood obesity]] by limiting the number of potatoes served, limiting salty foods, and adding more fresh vegetables, but this group was countered by a strong food lobby backed by [[Coca-Cola]], [[Del Monte Foods|Del Monte]], and makers of frozen pizza. <ref name=twsM34>{{cite news

}}</ref> But skeptics think that such a move proposed by Republican lawmakers could "usher in a lobbying bonanza from industry and other special-interest groups" to use campaign contributions to reshape the regulatory milieu. <ref name=twsL37/> . 

===Attempts at reform===. 
Critics suggest that Congress has the power to fix itself, but is reluctant to sacrifice money and power. One report suggested that those in control had an "unbroken record of finding ways to navigate around reform laws or turn regulatory standards to their own advantage."<ref name=twsW11/> . 

===Arguments for lobbying===. 
There are counterarguments that the system is working as it should, despite being rather messy. According to this line of argument, the Madisonian view of politics—in which factions were supposed to compete with other factions—is working exactly as it should. Competing factions, or in this case, competing interest groups, square off. Battling happens within the federal government, but instead of by settling arguments by elections, arguments are settled by powerful interest groups fighting each other, often financially. <ref name=twsN411/> And it might appear to members of groups which lost in a lobbying battle that the ''reason'' for their loss was that the other side lobbied unfairly using more money. <ref name=twsN411/> There are numerous instances in which opposed lobbies stalemate, and instances in which these stalemates have been seen as a positive result. And sometimes powerful financial interests lose the battle.  . 

Lobbying brings valuable information to policymakers, according to another argument in favor of lobbying. Since lobbyists often become highly knowledgeable about a specific issue by studying it in depth over years, they can bring considerable expertise to help legislators avoid errors as well as grasp the nuances of complex issues. This information can also help Congress oversee numerous federal agencies which often regulate complex industries and issue highly detailed and specific rulings. <ref name=EpsteinOHalloran/> Accordingly, it is difficult for Congress to keep track of what these agencies do. <ref name=EpsteinOHalloran/> It has been argued that lobbyists can help Congress monitor this activity by possibly raising "red flags" about proposed administrative rulings. <ref name=EpsteinOHalloran>{{cite journal|last=Epstein|first=David|coauthors=Sharyn O'Halloran|title=A Theory of Strategic Oversight: Congress, Lobbyists, and the Bureaucracy|journal=Journal of Law, Economics, & Organization |year=1995| month=October|volume=11|issue=2|pages=227-255 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/764997|accessdate=1 April 2012}}</ref> Further, congresspersons can quickly gauge where they stand about a proposed administrative ruling simply by seeing which lobbying groups support the proposal, and which oppose it. <ref name=EpsteinOHalloran/> . 

Another argument in support of lobbying is that different interest groups and lobbyists, while trying to build coalitions and win support, often amend or soften or change their positions in this process, and that interest groups and lobbyists regulate each other, in a sense. <ref name=EpsteinOHalloran/>  . 

But a more general sentiment supporting the lobbying arrangement is that every citizen can be construed as being "represented" by dozens of  special interests:<ref name=twsL16/> . 

{{Quote|Every citizen is a special interest... Blacks, consumers, teachers, pro-choicers, gun control advocates, handicapped people, aliens, exporters, and salesmen -- are all special interests... There is not an American today who is not represented (whether he or she knows it or not) by at least a dozen special interest groups. ...

Another view in support of lobbying is that it serves a helpful purpose as helping guard against extremism. <ref name=twsL16/> According to this view, lobbying adds "built-in delays" and permits and encourages opposing lobbies to battle. <ref name=twsL16/> In the battling, possibly damaging decrees and incorrect decisions are stymied by seemingly unhelpful delays and waits. <ref name=twsL16/> . 

A slightly different view is that lobbying is no different from other professions: .

==The regulatory environment==. 
===Disclosure and domestic regulations===. 
Generally, the United States requires systematic disclosure of lobbying, and it may be one of the few countries to have such extensive requirements. <ref name=twsM214/> Disclosure in one sense allows lobbyists and public officials to justify their actions under the banner of openness and with full compliance of the law. <ref name=twsL36/> The rules often specify how much a lobbyist can spend on specific activities, and how to report expenses; many of the laws and guidelines are specified in the [[Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995]]. <ref name=twsN511/> Transparency and disclosure requirements mean that there are volumes of statistics available for all kinds of analyses -- by journalists, by the public, by rival lobbying efforts. <ref name=twsN214/> Researchers can subdivide lobbying expenditures by numerous breakdowns, such as by contributions from energy companies. <ref name=twsN214>{{cite news

Sometimes defining clearly who is a "lobbyist" and what precisely are ''lobbying activities'' can be difficult. According to the Lobbying Disclosure Act, several authorized definitions include: . 

* ''Lobbying activities'' means "lobbying contacts and efforts in support of such contacts, including preparation and planning activities, research and other background work that is intended, at the time it is performed, for use in contacts, and coordination with the lobbying activities of others."<ref name=twsM214/>
* ''Lobbying contact'' means "any oral or written communication (including an electronic communication) to a covered executive branch official or a covered legislative branch official". <ref name=twsM214/> . 

Still, distinguishing ''lobbyists'' from a ''strategic adviser'' can be difficult, since the duties of each can often overlap and are hard to define precisely. <ref name=twsN113/> There have been issues raised about what constitutes the difference between a ''lobbyist'' and a ''bundler''; one report described ''bundlers'' as "supporters who contribute their own money to his campaign and solicit it from others", and there was a question whether such persons were really ''lobbyists'' involved with raising campaign monies for the election of [[Barack Obama]], and whether Obama had broken his own pledge not to receive money from lobbyists. <ref name=twsM24>{{cite news

There are numerous regulations governing the practice of lobbying, often ones requiring transparency and disclosure. <ref name=twsN511/> People paid to lobby must register with the secretary of the Senate and the clerk of the House of Representatives within 45 days of contacting a legislator for the first time, or 45 days after being employed. <ref name=twsN511/><ref name=twsL16/> An exception is that lobbyists who earn less than $3,000 per client for each fiscal quarter, or whose total lobbying expenses are less than $11,500 each quarter, do not need to register. <ref name=twsN511/> Part-time lobbyists are exempt from registering unless they spend more than 20% of their working hours doing lobbying activities in any quarter. If lobbyists have two or more contacts with a legislator as a lobbyist, then they must register. <ref name=twsN511/><ref name=twsL16/> Requirements for registering also apply to companies that specialize in lobbying, or ones that have an in-house lobbyist, particularly if they spend more than $11,500 on lobbying. <ref name=twsN511/> Generally, nonprofit organizations, other than churches, are exempt from registering if they hire an outside lobbying firm. <ref name=twsN511/> Filing must be made each quarter, and a separate file is needed for each of the lobbyist's clients, and include information such as the name and title of the client, an estimate of lobbying expenses, and an estimate of income the lobbyist achieved after doing the lobbying. <ref name=twsN511/> . 

States, in addition, are moving in the direction of greater disclosure and transparency regarding lobbying activities. [[California]] has an online database called ''Cal-Access'' although there were reports that it has been underfunded. <ref name=twsM55>{{cite news

Laws requiring disclosure have been more prevalent in the twentieth century. In 1946, there was a so-called "sunshine law" requiring lobbyists to disclose what they were doing, on whose behalf, and how much they received in payment. <ref>1946 law (60 Stat. 839) August 2 1946.

Lobbyists sometimes support rules requiring greater transparency and disclosure: .

J. Cassidy, 2007<ref name=twsM33fsa/>}}. 
Scandals can spur impetus towards greater regulation as well. The [[Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal]], which started in the 1990s and led to a guilt plea in 2006, inspired the 'Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act of 2006' ({{USBill|109|S|2349}}). According to ''[[Time Magazine]]'' the Senate bill:
# barred lobbyists themselves from buying gifts and meals for legislators, but left a loophole in which firms and organizations represented by those lobbyists could still dole out gifts and perks;
# allowed privately funded trips if lawmakers got prior approval from a commissioned ethics committee;
# required lobbyists to file frequent and detailed activity reports and have them posted publicly. The bill was approved in 2006 by a 90-8 vote.  . 

In 1995, the [[104th Congress]] tried to reform Lobbying by passing the ''[[Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995]]'' which defines and requires lobbyists who are compensated for their actions to register with congressional officials. The legislation was later amended by the ''Lobbying Disclosure Technical Amendments Act of 1998''. There were subsequent modifications leading to the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007. <ref name=twsM214/> The ''Lobbying Transparency and Accountability Act of 2006'' ({{USBill|109|HR|4975}}) legislation modified Senate rules, although some senators and a coalition of good-government groups assailed the bill as being too weak. <ref>[http://releases.usnewswire.com/GetRelease.asp?id=63157 Statement of Reform Groups on Lobbying Legislation Passed by Senate], March 29, 2006.

Jack Abramoff, emerging from prison, has spoken publicly about lobbying. In his view, regulations designed to rein in the excesses of lobbying have not been effective, and that reforms and regulations have not cleaned up the system "at all". Abramoff said lobbyists could "find a way around just about any reform Congress enacted", and gave an example: . 

{{Quote|You can't take a congressman to lunch for $25 and buy him a hamburger or a steak or something like that ... But you can take him to a fund-raising lunch and not only buy him that steak, but give him $25,000 extra and call it a fund-raiser -- and have all the same access and all the same interactions with that congressman.|[[Jack Abramoff]], commenting on ''[[60 Minutes]]'', according to ''[[CNN]]''<ref name=twsM111>{{cite news

A similar view suggested that lobbying reform efforts have been "fought tooth and nail to prevent its passage" since the people with the power to reform would curtail their own powers and income flows. <ref name=twsL19/> . 

===Foreign lobbying===. 
Since commerce worldwide is becoming more integrated, with firms headquartered in one country increasingly doing business in many other countries, it is logical to expect that lobbying efforts will reflect the increasing [[globalization]]. Sometimes foreign-owned corporations will want to lobby the United States government, and in such instances, new rules can apply, since it can be particularly thorny resolving whether [[national security]] interests are at stake and how they might be affected.  . 

In 1938, the ''Foreign Agents Registration Act''<ref>(52 Stat. 631) of June 8, 1938</ref> required an explicit listing of all political activities undertaken by a lobbyist on behalf of any foreign principal. <ref name=twsL16/> There had serious concerns about lobbying firms representing foreign entities – and potentially values opposed to American principles - after [[Axis power]] agitprop was planted in American soils during [[World War II]]<ref>The Harvard Law Reviews Association.

July 2007. <http://www.harpers.org/archive/2007/07/0081591></ref> FARA's mandate was to disclose to policymakers the sources of information that influenced public opinions, policies, and law. <ref>Zhang, Juyan.

"Foreign Agents: Updating FARA to Protect American Democracy." University of Pennsylvania Journal of International Law.  pp. 1051-1088,  Fall 2009: 1052</ref> Nonetheless, it was estimated that less than half of foreign lobbyists who should have registered under FARA actually did so. <ref>Silverstein, Ken. "Their Men in Washington: Undercover with D.C.'s lobbyists for hire". Harpers Magazine. July 2007. <http://www.harpers.org/archive/2007/07/0081591></ref> . 

By the 1960s, perceived failures in FARA’s enforcement led to public outcry against lobbying excesses, while revelations of foreign bribery circulated regularly well into the early 1970’s. <ref name="Business Ethics 1997">Keffer, Jone M. and Hill, Roland Paul. "Ethical Approach to Lobbying Activities of Businesses in the United States", Journal of Business Ethics, 16.12/13 (1997): 1371-1379</ref> This prompted legislation proposed to reduce the autonomy of foreign firms, most of which was not ratified for concerns over a lack of constitutionality. <ref name="Business Ethics 1997"/> While the House of Representatives passed a rule<ref>Bill S. 349 in 1994 by a vote of 315-110</ref> to increase public scrutiny of foreign lobbying, one estimate was that about 75% of lobbyists were exempt from a registration requirement, including individuals representing foreign interests. <ref>Dunham, R. S.: 1994, 'Why Lobbying Reform Could Get Lobbied to Death', Business Week, 57</ref>  .
