The '''United States Congress''' is the [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[legislature]] of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] of the [[United States]], consisting of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. The Congress meets in the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] . 

Both Representatives and Senators are chosen through [[direct election]]. There are 535 voting Members of Congress, of which, the House of Representatives has a membership of 435 and the Senate has a membership 100. Members of the House of Representatives serve two-year terms representing the people of a district. Congressional Districts are determined by [[Rep by pop|population]] using the United States Census results and each State in the union having at least one Representative in the Congress. Each state, regardless of population, has two Senators; since there are fifty states, there are one hundred Senators who each serve a six-year term. The terms are staggered, so every two years, approximately one-third of the Senate is up for election. Most incumbents seek re-election, and their historical likelihood of winning subsequent elections exceeds 90%. <ref name=incumbent/> . 

==Overview==. 
[[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]] of the [[Constitution for the United States of America|Constitution]] states "all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives." The House and Senate are equal partners in the legislative process—legislation cannot be enacted without the consent of both chambers. However, the Constitution grants each chamber some unique powers. The Senate ratifies treaties and approves [[President of the United States|presidential]] appointments while the House initiates revenue-raising bills.  The House initiates [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] cases, while the Senate decides impeachment cases. <ref name=tws2010Sep11bb6a>{{cite news

{{Politics of the United States}}
<blockquote>Congress reflects us in all our strengths and all our weaknesses. It reflects our regional idiosyncrasies, our ethnic, religious, and racial diversity, our multitude of professions, and our shadings of opinion on everything from the value of war to the war over values. Congress is the government's most representative body ... Congress is essentially charged with reconciling our many points of view on the great public policy issues of the day. — <small>Smith, Roberts, and Wielen</small><ref name=tws2010Sep11t14aa/></blockquote> .

The Congress of the United States serve two distinct purposes that overlap: local representation to the federal government of a Congressional District by Representatives and a State's at-large representation to the federal government by Senators.  . 

==History==. 
{{Main|History of the United States Congress}}
The [[First Continental Congress]] was a gathering of Representatives from twelve of the thirteen [[British colonization of the Americas|British Colonies in North America]]. <ref name="kramnick">{{cite book |author=Kramnick, Isaac (ed); Thomas Paine |title=Common Sense |publisher=Penguin Classics |year=1982 |page=21}}</ref> On July 4, 1776, the [[Second Continental Congress]] adopted the [[Declaration of Independence of the United States|Declaration of Independence]], referring to the new nation as the "United States of America". The [[Articles of Confederation]] in 1781 created a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] body with equal representation among the states in which each state had a veto over most decisions. With no executive or judiciary, and minimal authority, this government was weak<ref name=WeaknessArticlesConfederation/> and lacked authority to collect taxes, regulate commerce, or enforce laws. <ref name="english-p5-6">English (2003), pp. 5–6</ref><ref>Collier (1986), p. 5</ref> .

[[Political scientist]] Julian E. Zelizer suggested there were four main congressional eras, with considerable overlap, and included the ''formative era'' (1780s–1820s), the ''partisan era'' (1830s–1900s), the ''committee era'' (1910s–1960s), and the ''contemporary era'' (1970s–today). <ref name=tws2010Sep11t14dd2>{{cite news

===The formative era (1780s–1820s)===. 
[[Federalist Party|Federalists]] and [[anti-federalists]] jostled for power in the early years as political parties became pronounced, surprising the Constitution's [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Framers]]. [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s election to the presidency marked a peaceful transition of power between the parties in 1800. [[John Marshall]], 4th Chief Justice of the Supreme Court empowered the courts by establishing the principle of [[judicial review]] in law in the landmark case ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' in 1803, effectively giving the Supreme Court a power to nullify congressional legislation.  . 

===The partisan era (1830s–1900s)===. 
These years were marked by growth in the power of political parties. The watershed event was the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] which resolved the slavery issue and unified the nation under federal authority, but weakened the power of [[states rights]]. A [[Gilded Age]] (1877–1901) was marked by [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] dominance of Congress. During this time, lobbying activity became more intense, particularly during the administration of President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in which influential lobbies advocated for railroad subsidies and tariffs on wool. <ref>Margaret S. Thompson, ''The "Spider Web": Congress and Lobbying in the Age of Grant'' (1985)</ref> Immigration and high birth rates swelled the ranks of citizens and the nation grew at a rapid pace. The [[Progressive Era]] was characterized by strong party leadership in both houses of Congress as well as calls for reform; sometimes reformers would attack lobbyists as corrupting politics. <ref>Elisabeth S. Clemens, ''The People’s Lobby: Organizational Innovation and the Rise of Interest-Group Politics in the United States, 1890–1925'' (1997)</ref> The position of [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] became extremely powerful under leaders such as [[Thomas Brackett Reed|Thomas Reed]] in 1890 and [[Joseph Gurney Cannon]]. The Senate was effectively controlled by a half dozen men.  . 

===The committee era (1910s–1960s)===. 
[[File:United States Capitol - west front.jpg|thumb|The [[United States Capitol]]]]
A system of seniority—in which long-time Members of Congress gained more and more power—encouraged politicians of both parties to serve for long terms. [[United States Congressional committees|Committee]] chairmen remained influential in both houses until the reforms of the 1970s. Important structural changes included the direct election of senators by popular election according to the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]]<ref name=tws2010Sep11t14dd5>{{cite news

===Powers of Congress===. 
{{Main|Powers of the United States Congress}} . 

====Overview of congressional power====. 
[[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I of the Constitution]] sets forth most of the powers of Congress, which include numerous explicit powers enumerated in Section 8. [[Constitutional amendment]]s have granted Congress additional powers. Congress also has [[implied powers]] derived from the Constitution's [[Necessary and Proper Clause]].  . 

Congress has authority over financial and budgetary policy through the enumerated power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States. There is vast authority over budgets, although analyst Eric Patashnik suggested that much of Congress's power to manage the budget has been lost when the welfare state expanded since "entitlements were institutionally detached from Congress's ordinary legislative routine and rhythm."<ref name=tws2010Sep11t14dd2>{{cite news|author= Eric Patashnik|title= The American Congress: The Building of Democracy|publisher= Houghton Mifflin Company|pages= 671–2 |year= 2004 |isbn= 0-618-17906-2 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=_MGEIIwT5pUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Zelizer+Julian+2004+American+Congress+The+Building+of+Democracy#v=onepage&q=Zelizer%20Julian%202004%20American%20Congress%20The%20Building%20of%20Democracy&f=false |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}</ref> Another factor leading to less control over the budget was a [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] belief that balanced budgets were unnecessary. <ref name=tws2010Sep11t14dd2/> .

Representative [[Lee H. Hamilton]] explained how Congress functions within the federal government:
<blockquote>
To me the key to understanding it is balance. The founders went to great lengths to balance institutions against each other—balancing powers among the three branches: Congress, the president, and the Supreme Court; between the House of Representatives and the Senate; between the federal government and the states; among states of different sizes and regions with different interests; between the powers of government and the rights of citizens, as spelled out in the Bill of Rights ...

[[File:Senate in session.jpg|thumb|The [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment trial of President Clinton]] in 1999, [[William H. Rehnquist|Chief Justice William Rehnquist]] presiding.]]
The Constitution concentrates removal powers in the Congress by empowering and obligating the House of Representatives to [[Impeachment in the United States|impeach]] both executive and judicial officials for "Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors." Impeachment is a ''formal accusation'' of unlawful activity by a civil officer or government official. The Senate is constitutionally empowered and obligated to try all impeachments. A simple majority in the House is required to impeach an official; however, a two-thirds majority in the Senate is required for conviction. A convicted official is automatically removed from office; in addition, the Senate may stipulate that the [[defendant]] be banned from holding office in the future. Impeachment proceedings may not inflict more than this; however, a convicted party may face criminal penalties in a normal court of law. In the history of the United States, the House of Representatives has impeached sixteen officials, of whom seven were convicted. Another resigned before the Senate could complete the trial. Only two presidents have ever been impeached: [[Andrew Johnson]] in 1868 and [[Bill Clinton]] in 1999. Both [[trial (law)|trials]] ended in [[acquittal]]; in Johnson's case, the Senate fell one vote short of the two-thirds majority required for [[conviction (law)|conviction]]. In 1974, [[Richard Nixon]] resigned from office after impeachment proceedings in the [[House Judiciary Committee]] indicated he would eventually be removed from office.  . 

The Senate has an important check on the executive power by confirming [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] [[official]]s, [[judge]]s, and other high officers "by and with the advice and consent" of the Senate. It confirms most presidential nominees but rejections are not uncommon. Furthermore, treaties negotiated by the President must be ratified by a two-thirds majority vote in the Senate to take effect. As a result, presidential arm-twisting of senators can happen before a key vote; for example, President Obama's secretary of state, [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], urged her former senate colleagues to approve a nuclear arms treaty with Russia in 2010. <ref name=tws2010Sep11rr>{{cite news

In 1803, the Supreme Court established [[judicial review]] of federal legislation in ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', holding, however, that Congress could not grant unconstitutional power to the Court itself. The Constitution does not explicitly state that the courts may exercise judicial review; however, the notion that courts could declare laws [[unconstitutional]] was envisioned by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding fathers]]. [[Alexander Hamilton]], for example, mentioned and expounded upon the doctrine in [[Federalist No. 78]]. [[Originalism|Originalists]] on the Supreme Court have argued that if the constitution does not say something explicitly it is unconstitutional to infer what it should, might or could have said. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cfif.org/htdocs/legal_issues/legal_updates/us_supreme_court/scalia-constitutional-speech.htm |title=Constitutional Interpretation the Old Fashioned Way |publisher=Center For Individual Freedom |accessdate=September 15, 2007}}</ref> Judicial review means that the Supreme Court can nullify a congressional law. It is a huge check by the courts on the legislative authority and limits congressional power substantially. In 1857, for example, the Supreme Court struck down provisions of a congressional act of 1820 in its [[Dred Scott]] decision. <ref name=tws2010Sep11ss>{{cite news

Investigations are conducted to gather information on the need for future legislation, to test the effectiveness of laws already passed, and to inquire into the qualifications and performance of members and officials of the other branches.

==Structure==. 
{{Main|Structure of the U.S. Congress}}
Congress is split into two branches—House and Senate—and manages the huge task of writing national legislation by dividing work into separate committees which specialize in different areas. Some members of Congress are elected by their peers to be officers of these committees. Further, Congress has ancillary organizations such as the [[Government Accountability Office]] and the [[Library of Congress]] to help provide it with information, and members of Congress have staff and offices to assist them as well. In addition, a vast industry of lobbyists helps members write legislation on behalf of diverse corporate and labor interests.  . 

===Committees===. 
{{Main|United States congressional committee}}
{{Image|Congress Hall committee room 2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photo of a table with chairs.|Second committee room in [[Congress Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]]}} . 

====Specialization====. 
The committee structure permits members of Congress to study a particular subject intensely. It is neither expected nor possible that a member be an expert on all subject areas before Congress. <ref name="english-46">English (2003), pp. 46–47</ref> As time goes by, members develop expertise in particular subjects and their legal aspects. [[United States congressional committee|Committees]] investigate specialized subjects and advise the entire Congress about choices and trade-offs. The choice of specialty may be influenced by the member's constituency, important regional issues, prior background and experience. <ref>English, p. 46</ref> Senators often choose a different specialty from that of the other senator from their state to prevent overlap. <ref>{{cite book |author=Schiller, Wendy J. |title=Partners and Rivals: Representation in U.S. Senate Delegations |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0691048878}}</ref> Some committees specialize in running the business of other committees and exert a powerful influence over all legislation; for example, the House Ways and Means Committee has considerable influence over House affairs. <ref name=tws2010Sep11ff511234>{{cite news

}}</ref> . 

====Power====. 
Committees write legislation. While procedures such as the House discharge petition process can introduce bills to the House floor and effectively bypass committee input, they are exceedingly difficult to implement without committee action. Committees have power and have been called ''independent fiefdoms''. Legislative, oversight, and internal administrative tasks are divided among about two hundred committees and [[United States Congressional subcommittee|subcommittees]] which gather information, evaluate alternatives, and identify problems. <ref name="House_Rules"/> They propose solutions for consideration by the full chamber. <ref name="House_Rules"/> In addition, they perform the function of ''oversight'' by monitoring the executive branch and investigating wrongdoing. <ref name="House_Rules">[http://www.rules.house.gov/archives/98-241.pdf Committee Types and Roles], ''[[Congressional Research Service]]'', April 1, 2003</ref> . 

====Officers====. 
At the start of each two-year session the [[House of Representatives of the United States|House]] elects a [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|speaker]] who does not normally preside over debates but serves as its majority leader. In the [[United States Senate|Senate]], the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] is the [[ex officio]] ''president'' of the Senate. In addition, the Senate elects an officer called the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore]]. ''Pro tempore'' means ''for the time being'' and this office is usually held by the most senior member of the Senate's majority party and customarily keeps this position until there's a change in party control. Accordingly, the Senate does not necessarily elect a new president pro tempore at the beginning of a new Congress.  . 

===Support services===. 
====Library of Congress====. 
{{Main|Library of Congress}}
The Library of Congress was established by an act of Congress in 1800. It is primarily housed in three buildings on [[Capitol Hill]], but also includes several other sites: the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped in Washington, D.C.; the National Audio-Visual Conservation Center in Culpeper, Virginia; a large book storage facility located at Ft. Meade, Maryland; and multiple overseas offices. The Library had mostly law books when it was burned by a British raiding party during the [[War of 1812]], but the library's collections were restored and expanded when Congress authorized the purchase of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s private library. One of the Library's missions is to serve the Congress and its staff as well as the American public. It is the largest library in the world with nearly 150 million items including books, films, maps, photographs, music, manuscripts, graphics, and materials in 470 languages. <ref name=aboutLOC>http://www.loc.gov/about/generalinfo.html</ref> . 

====Congressional Research Service====. 
{{Main|Congressional Research Service}}
The [[Congressional Research Service]] provides detailed, up-to-date and non-partisan research for senators, representatives, and their staff to help them carry out their official duties. It provides ideas for legislation, helps members analyze a bill, facilitates public hearings, makes reports, consults on matters such as parliamentary procedure, and helps the two chambers resolve disagreements. It has been called the "House's think tank" and has a staff of about 900 employees. <ref name="CRS Report about CRS">{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33471.pdf|title=The Congressional Research Service and the American Legislative Process|year=2008|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=July 25, 2009}}</ref> . 

====Congressional Budget Office====.

It was created as an independent nonpartisan agency by the [[Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974]]. It helps Congress estimate revenue inflows from taxes and helps the budgeting process. It makes projections about such matters as the [[national debt]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/aboutcbo/ |title=Congressional Budget Office – About CBO |publisher=Cbo.gov |date= |accessdate=December 20, 2010}}</ref> as well as likely costs of legislation. It prepares an annual ''Economic and Budget Outlook'' with a mid-year update and writes ''An Analysis of the President's Budgetary Proposals'' for the  [[Senate Committee on Appropriations|Senate's Appropriations Committee]]. The [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] and the [[President pro tempore of the Senate|Senate's President pro tempore]] jointly appoint the CBO Director for a four year term.  . 

====Lobbyists====. 
{{Main|Lobbying in the United States}}
Lobbyists represent diverse interests and often seek to influence congressional decisions to reflect their clients' needs. [[Lobby groups]] and their members sometimes write legislation and [[Whip (politics)|whip]] bills. In 2007 there were approximately 17,000 federal lobbyists in Washington. <ref>{{cite book |title=Washington Representatives

===Partisanship versus bipartisanship=== . 

Congress has alternated between periods of constructive cooperation and compromise between parties known as [[bipartisanship]] and periods of fierce political infighting known as [[partisanship]]. The period after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] was marked by partisanship as is the case today. It is generally easier for committees to reach accord on issues when compromise is possible. Some [[Political science|political scientists]] speculate that a prolonged period marked by narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress has intensified partisanship in the last few decades<ref name=tws2010Sep11t14cc577>{{cite news

==Procedures of Congress==. 
{{Main|Procedures of the U.S. Congress}} . 

===Sessions===. 
A term of Congress is divided into two "[[legislative session|sessions]]", one for each year; Congress has occasionally been called into an extra or ''special session''. A new session commences on January 3 each year unless Congress decides differently. The Constitution requires Congress meet at least once each year and forbids either house from meeting outside the Capitol.  . 

===Joint sessions===. 
{{Main|Joint session of the United States Congress}}
Joint Sessions of the United States Congress occur on special occasions that require a concurrent resolution from both House and Senate. These sessions include counting [[electoral votes]] after a presidential election and the president's State of the Union address. The constitutionally-mandated report, normally given as an annual speech, is modeled on Britain's [[Speech from the Throne]], was written by most presidents after [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]] but personally delivered as a spoken oration beginning with [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] in 1913. Joint Sessions and Joint Meetings are traditionally presided over by the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] except when counting presidential electoral votes when the [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] presides.  . 

===Bills and resolutions===. 
[[File:US House Committee.jpg|thumb|right|The House Financial Services committee meets. Committee members sit in the tiers of raised chairs, while those testifying and audience members sit below.]]
Ideas for legislation can come from members, lobbyists, state legislatures, constituents, legislative counsel, or executive agencies. The usual next step is for the proposal to be passed to a committee for review. <ref name=tws2010Sep11bb6c>{{cite news

* '''Joint resolutions'''. There is little difference between a bill and a joint resolution since both are treated similarly; a joint resolution originating from the House, for example, begins "H.J.Res." followed by its number. <ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> . 

* '''Concurrent Resolutions''' affect only both House and Senate and accordingly are not presented to the president for approval later. In the House, it begins with "H.Con.Res."<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> . 

* '''Simple resolutions''' concern only the House or only the Senate and begin with "H.Res."<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> . 

Representatives introduce a bill while the House is in session by placing it in the ''hopper'' on the Clerk's desk. <ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> It's assigned a number and referred to a committee which studies each bill intensely at this stage. <ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Drafting statutes requires "great skill, knowledge, and experience" and sometimes take a year or more. <ref name=tws2010Sep11bb6c/> Sometimes [[lobbying|lobbyists]] write [[legislation]] and submit it to a member for introduction. Joint resolutions are the normal way to propose a constitutional amendment or declare war. On the other hand, concurrent resolutions (passed by both houses) and simple resolutions (passed by only one house) do not have the force of [[law]] but express the opinion of Congress or regulate [[Parliamentary procedure|procedure]]. Bills may be introduced by any member of either house. However, the Constitution provides that: "All bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives." While the Senate cannot originate [[revenue]] and appropriation bills, it has power to amend or reject them. Congress has sought ways to establish appropriate spending levels. <ref name=tws2010Sep11bb6x6>{{cite news

Witnesses and experts can present their case for or against a bill. <ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Then, a bill may go to what's called a ''mark-up'' session where committee members debate the bill's merits and may offer amendments or revisions. <ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Committees may also amend the bill, but the full house holds the power to accept or reject committee amendments. After debate, the committee votes whether it wishes to report the measure to the full house. If a bill is ''tabled'' then it is rejected. If amendments are extensive, sometimes a new bill with amendments built in will be submitted as a so-called ''clean bill'' with a new number. <ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Both houses have procedures under which committees can be bypassed or overruled but they are rarely used. Generally, members who have been in Congress longer have greater seniority and therefore greater power. <ref name=tws2010Sep11qq/> . 

A bill which reaches the floor of the full house can be simple or complex<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> and begins with an [[enacting formula]] such as "Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled." Consideration of a bill requires, itself, a ''rule'' which is a simple resolution specifying the particulars of debate—time limits, possibility of further amendments, and such. <ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Each side has equal time and members can yield to other members who wish to speak. <ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Sometimes opponents seek to ''recommit'' a bill which means to change part of it. <ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Generally, discussion requires a ''quorum'', usually half of the total number of representatives, before discussion can begin, although there are exceptions. <ref name=tws2010Sep11mm>{{cite news

Once a bill is approved by one house, it is sent to the other which may pass, reject, or amend it. For the bill to become law, both houses must agree to identical versions of the bill. <ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> If the second house amends the bill, then the differences between the two versions must be reconciled in a [[United States congressional conference committee|conference committee]], an ''ad hoc'' committee that includes both senators and representatives<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> sometimes by using a ''reconciliation process'' to limit budget bills. <ref name=tws2010Sep11bb6x6/> Both Houses use a budget enforcement mechanism informally known as ''pay-as-you-go'' or ''paygo'' which discourages members from considering acts which increase budget deficits. <ref name=tws2010Sep11bb6x6/> If both houses agree to the version reported by the conference committee, the bill passes, otherwise it fails.  . 

The Constitution specifies that a majority of members known as a ''[[quorum]]'' be present before doing business in each house. However, the rules of each house assume that a quorum is present unless a quorum call demonstrates the contrary. Since representatives and senators who are present rarely demand quorum calls, debate often continues despite the lack of a majority.  . 

Voting within Congress can take many forms, including systems using lights and bells and electronic voting. <ref name=tws2010Sep11bb6x5>{{cite news

}}</ref> Both houses use voice voting to decide most matters in which members shout "aye" or "no" and the presiding officer announces the result. The Constitution, however, requires a [[recorded vote]] if demanded by one-fifth of the members present. If the voice vote is unclear or if the matter is controversial, a recorded vote usually happens. The Senate uses [[roll call]] voting in which a clerk calls out the names of all the senators, each senator stating "aye" or "no" when his or her name is announced. The House reserves roll call votes for the most formal matters, as a roll-call of all 435 representatives takes quite some time; normally, members vote by using an electronic device. In the case of a tie, the motion in question fails. In the Senate, the vice president may cast the tiebreaking vote if he or she is present.  . 

Most votes, including quorum votes, are done electronically, and allow members to vote ''yea'' or ''nay'' or ''present'' or ''open''. <ref name=tws2010Sep11bb6x5/> Members insert a voting ''ID card'' and can change their votes during the last five minutes if they choose; in addition, paper ballots are used on some occasions—''yea'' indicated by green and ''nay'' by red. <ref name=tws2010Sep11bb6x5/> One member can not cast a vote for another. <ref name=tws2010Sep11bb6x5/> Congressional votes are recorded on an online database. <ref name=tws2010Sep11gg>{{cite news

After passage by both houses, a bill is considered to be ''enrolled'' and is sent to the [[President of the United States|president]] for approval. <ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> The president may sign it making it law or [[veto]] it, perhaps returning it to Congress with his objections. A vetoed bill can still become law if each house of Congress votes to override the veto with a two-thirds majority. Finally, the president may do nothing—neither signing nor vetoing the bill—and then the bill becomes law automatically after ten days (not counting Sundays) according to the Constitution. But if Congress is adjourned during this period, presidents may veto legislation passed at the end of a congressional session simply by ignoring it; the maneuver is known as a [[pocket veto]], and cannot be overridden by the adjourned Congress.  .

Nevertheless, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has treated campaign contributions as a [[free speech]] issue. <ref name="tws01oct38"/> Some see money as a good influence in politics since it "enables candidates to communicate with voters."<ref name="tws01oct38"/> Few members retire from Congress without complaining about how much it costs to campaign for reelection. <ref name=tws2010Sep11t14cc/> Critics contend that members of Congress are more likely to attend to the needs of heavy campaign contributors than to ordinary citizens. <ref name=tws2010Sep11t14cc/> . 

Elections are influenced by many variables. Some political scientists speculate there is a ''coattail effect'' (when a popular president or party position has the effect of reelecting incumbents who win by "riding on the president's coattails"), although there is some evidence that the coattail effect is irregular and possibly declining since the 1950s. <ref name=tws2010Sep11jggha/> Some districts are so heavily Democratic or Republican that they are called a [[safe seat]]; any candidate winning the primary will almost always be elected, and these candidates do not need to spend money on advertising. <ref name=tws30sep13>{{cite news

}}</ref> They contend that "Congress is easy to dislike and often difficult to defend" and this perception is exacerbated because many challengers running for Congress run ''against'' Congress, which is an "old form of American politics" that further undermines Congress's reputation with the public:<ref name=tws2010Sep11t14cc/> . 

<blockquote>The rough-and-tumble world of legislating is not orderly and civil, human frailties too often taint its membership, and legislative outcomes are often frustrating and ineffective ... Still, we are not exaggerating when we say that Congress is essential to American democracy. We would not have survived as a nation without a Congress that represented the diverse interests of our society, conducted a public debate on the major issues, found compromises to resolve conflicts peacefully, and limited the power of our executive, military, and judicial institutions ... The popularity of Congress ebbs and flows with the public's confidence in government generally ... the legislative process is easy to dislike—it often generates political posturing and grandstanding, it necessarily involves compromise, and it often leaves broken promises in its trail. Also, members of Congress often appear self-serving as they pursue their political careers and represent interests and reflect values that are controversial. Scandals, even when they involve a single member, add to the public's frustration with Congress and have contributed to the institution's low ratings in opinion polls. <small>—Smith, Roberts & Wielen</small><ref name=tws2010Sep11t14cc/></blockquote> . 

An additional factor that confounds public perceptions of Congress is that Congressional issues are becoming more technical and complex and require expertise in subjects such as [[science]] and [[engineering]] and [[economics]]. <ref name=tws2010Sep11t14cc/> As a result, Congress often cedes authority to experts at the executive branch. <ref name=tws2010Sep11t14cc/> . 

===Smaller states and bigger states===. 
When the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] was ratified in 1787, the ratio of the populations of large states to small states was roughly twelve to one. The [[Connecticut Compromise]] gave every state, large and small, an equal vote in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. <ref name=tws10janx01>{{cite web

===Members and constituents===. 
A major role for members of Congress is providing services to [[constituency|constituents]]. <ref>Charles L.

===Congressional style===. 
One way to categorize lawmakers, according to political scientist [[Richard Fenno]], is by their general motivation: . 

# '''''Reelection.''''' These are lawmakers who "never met a voter they didn't like" and provide excellent constituent services. 
# '''''Good public policy.''''' Legislators who "burnish a reputation for policy expertise and leadership."
# '''''Power in the chamber.''''' Lawmakers who spend serious time along the "rail of the House floor or in the Senate cloakroom ministering to the needs of their colleagues."<ref name=tws2010Sep11t14bb/> Famous legislator [[Henry Clay]] in the mid-19th century was described as an "issue entrepreneur" who looked for issues to serve his ambitions. <ref name=tws2010Sep11t14bb/> . 

==Privileges and pay==. 
===Privileges protecting members===. 
Members of Congress enjoy [[parliamentary privilege]], including [[Parliamentary immunity|freedom from arrest]] in all cases except for [[treason]], [[felony]], and [[breach of the peace]] and freedom of speech in debate. This constitutionally derived immunity applies to members during sessions and when traveling to and from sessions. <ref>Davidson (2006), p. 17</ref> The term ''arrest'' has been interpreted broadly, and includes any detention or delay in the course of [[Police|law enforcement]], including [[Summons|court summons]] and [[subpoena]]s. The rules of the House strictly guard this privilege; a member may not waive the privilege on his or her own, but must seek the permission of the whole house to do so. Senate rules however are less strict and permit individual senators to waive the privilege as they choose.  . 

The Constitution guarantees absolute freedom of debate in both houses, providing in the [[Speech or Debate Clause]] of the Constitution that "for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place." Accordingly, a member of Congress may not be sued in court for [[slander]] because of remarks made in either house, although each house has its own rules restricting offensive speeches, and may punish members who transgress them.  . 

Obstructing the work of Congress is a [[crime]] under [[federal law]] and is known as [[contempt of Congress]]. Each branch has the power to cite individuals for contempt but can only issue a contempt citation—the judicial system pursues the matter like a normal criminal case. If convicted in court, an individual found guilty of contempt of Congress may be imprisoned for up to one year.  . 

The [[franking]] privilege allows members of Congress to send official [[mail]] to constituents at government expense. Though they are not permitted to send election materials, borderline material is often sent, especially in the run-up to an election by those in close races. <ref>English (2003), pp. 24–25</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Simpson, G. R. |title=Surprise! Top Frankers Also Have the Stiffest Challenges |publisher=Roll Call |date=October 22, 1992}}</ref> Indeed, some academics consider free mailings as giving incumbents a big advantage over challengers. <ref name=incumbent/><ref name=tws2010Sep11qaazzx>{{cite news

===Pay and benefits===. 
From 1789 to 1815, members of Congress received only a daily payment of $6 while in session. Members received an annual salary of $1,500 per year from 1815 to 1817, then a per diem salary of $8 from 1818 to 1855; since then they have received an annual salary, first pegged in 1855 at $3,000. <ref name="salaries">[http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/senate_salaries.htm Senate Salaries since 1789.] United States Senate.

Members elected since 1984 are covered by the [[Federal Employees Retirement System]] (FERS). Like other federal employees, congressional retirement is funded through taxes and participants' contributions. Members of Congress under FERS contribute 1.3% of their salary into the FERS retirement plan and pay 6.2% of their salary in Social Security taxes. And like Federal employees, members contribute one-third of the cost of health insurance with the government covering the other two-thirds. <ref>{{Cite news | first=Walter | last=Scott | title=Personality Parade column:Q. Does Congress pay for its own health care? | publisher=Parade | location=New York, NY | page= 2 | date=April 25, 2010  }}</ref> . 

The size of a congressional pension depends on the years of service and the average of the highest three years of his or her salary. By law, the starting amount of a member's retirement annuity may not exceed 80% of his or her final salary. In 2006, the average annual pension for retired senators and representatives under the [[Civil Service Retirement System]] (CSRS) was $60,972, while those who retired under FERS, or in combination with CSRS, was $35,952. <ref>[http://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/RL30631.pdf Retirement Benefits for Members of Congress] (PDF). [[Congressional Research Service]], February 9, 2007. </ref> . 

Members of Congress make fact-finding missions to learn about other countries and stay informed, but these outings can cause controversy if the trip is deemed excessive or unconnected with the task of governing. For example, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported lawmaker trips abroad at taxpayer expense, which included spas, $300-per-night extra unused rooms, and shopping excursions. <ref name=tws17decaafds/> Lawmakers respond that "traveling with spouses compensates for being away from them a lot in Washington" and justify the trips as a way to meet officials in other nations. <ref name=tws17decaafds>{{cite news
