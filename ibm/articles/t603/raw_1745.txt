====Second term====. 
During her second term as mayor, Palin proposed and promoted the construction of a municipal sports center to be financed by a 0.5%<ref name="nytimes090208"/> sales tax increase and $14.7&nbsp; million bond issue. <ref name="wsjhockeyrink">{{cite news| last = Phillips| first = Michael M.| title = Palin's Hockey Rink Leads To Legal Trouble in Town She Led| work = Wall Street Journal| date = September 6, 2008| url = http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122065537792905483.html| accessdate =September 8, 2008}}</ref> Voters approved the measure by a 20 vote margin and the Wasilla Multi-Use Sports Complex (later named the [[Curtis D.

Palin also joined with nearby communities in hiring the [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]]-based lobbying firm of [[R. E. Robertson|Robertson]], Monagle & Eastaugh to lobby for federal funds.

===State-level politics===. 
In 2002, Palin ran for the Republican nomination for [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Alaska|lieutenant governor]], coming in second to [[Loren Leman]] in a five-way Republican primary. <ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.elections.alaska.gov/results/02PRIM/data/results.pdf | title = State of Alaska Primary Election - August 27, 2002 Official Results| date=September 18, 2002 |accessdate =June 11, 2011| publisher = Alaska Division of Elections}}</ref> Following her defeat, she campaigned throughout the state for the nominated Republican governor-lieutenant governor ticket of [[Frank Murkowski]] and Leman. <ref name="ADN_Kizzia_20061024"/> Murkowski and Leman won, Murkowski resigned from his long-held [[U.S. Senate]] seat in December 2002 to assume the governorship. Palin was said to be on the "short list" of possible appointees to Murkowski's U.S. Senate seat,<ref name="ADN_Kizzia_20061024"/> but Murkowski ultimately appointed his daughter, [[Alaska House of Representatives|State Representative]] [[Lisa Murkowski]], as his successor in the Senate. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2010/06/02/palin_murkowski| title=The Palin-Murkowski rivalry, explained| first=Shushannah| last=Walshe| date=June 2, 2010|publisher=Salon| accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref> .

In the [[Alaska gubernatorial election, 2006|November election]], Palin was outspent but victorious, defeating former Democratic governor [[Tony Knowles (politician)|Tony Knowles]] by a margin of 48.3% to 40.9%. <ref name="Johnson" /> She became Alaska's first [[list of female state governors in the United States|female governor]], and, at the age of 42, the youngest governor in Alaskan history, the state's first governor to have been born after Alaska achieved U.S. [[Alaska Statehood Act|statehood]], and the first not to be inaugurated in [[Juneau]] (she chose to have the ceremony held in [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] instead).

Palin declared that top priorities of her administration would be resource development, education and workforce development, public health and safety, and transportation and infrastructure development. She had championed ethics reform throughout her election campaign. Her first legislative action after taking office was to push for a bipartisan ethics reform bill. She signed the resulting legislation in July 2007, calling it a "first step", and declaring that she remained determined to clean up Alaska politics. <ref>{{cite news| last = Halpin | first = James | title = Palin signs ethics reforms | publisher = Anchorage Daily News | date = July 10, 2007 | url = http://www.adn.com/324/story/150137.html | accessdate =September 12, 2008}}</ref> .

====Gubernatorial expenditures====. 
Palin lived in Juneau during the legislative session and lived in Wasilla and worked out of offices in Anchorage the rest of the year. Since the office in Anchorage is 565 miles from Juneau, while she worked there, state officials said she was permitted to claim a $58 ''[[per diem]]'' travel allowance, which she took (a total of $16,951), and to reimbursement for hotels, which she did not, choosing instead to drive about 50&nbsp;miles to her home in Wasilla. <ref name="wash-post-nights">{{cite news| last = Grimaldi| first = James V.| authorlink = James V.

While there is no state sales tax or income tax in Alaska, royalty revenues from the [[Prudhoe Bay Oil Field]] (comprised mostly of state-owned lands) have funded large state budgets since 1980, with the exact amounts largely dependent upon the prevailing [[price of petroleum]]. As a result, state revenues doubled to $10 billion in 2008.

Frank Murkowski submitted 63 earmark requests totaling $350 million, Palin's staff said. That slid to 52 earmarks valued at $256 million in Palin's first year.

====Bridge to Nowhere====.

{{Main|Gravina Island Bridge}}
In 2005, before Palin was elected governor, Congress passed an [[omnibus spending bill]] that contained a $442-million [[earmark (politics)|earmark]] for constructing two Alaska bridges. The [[Gravina Island Bridge]], intended to provide a link between the [[Ketchikan International Airport|Ketchikan airport]] on [[Gravina Island]] and the city of [[Ketchikan]] at a cost of $233 million in Federal grant money, received nationwide attention as a symbol of [[pork-barrel spending]]. As the island only has a population of 50, the bridge became known as the "Bridge to Nowhere." The public furor led to Congress removing the earmarks, but retaining the allotted funds to Alaska as part of its general transportation fund. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/us/23bridge.html| date = September 23, 2007| publisher = New York Times| title = Alaska Seeks Alternative to Bridge Plan| author = Associated Press staff| accessdate = April 3, 2009}}</ref> .

On [[Labor Day]], September 5, 2011, Palin was the featured speaker at a [[Tea Party Express]] rally in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]]'s Victory Park.

She addressed an enthusiastic crowd that the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' estimated to number 1,000 but which the local ''[[New Hampshire Union-Leader]]'' newspaper reported as "at least 500". Many in the crowd chanted "Run, Sarah, run!" during her speech.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} . 

Palin told the rally attendees that it was time to grow the Tea Party movement and it was important for them to avoid internal bickering with Establishment Republicans. <ref>{{cite news|last=Abcarian|first=Robin|title=N.H.
