The '''Bonus Bill of 1817''' was proposed legislation introduced by [[John C. Calhoun]] to provide a federal highway linking the East and South to the West using the earnings ''bonus'' from the [[Second Bank of the United States]]. Opponents feared that providing the means for settlers to travel would drain their population and create competiting states in the area obtained in the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. Though he approved of the goals, President [[James Madison]] vetoed the bill as unconstitutional under [[strict constructionist]] ideals.  . 

Madison's veto message represents an important explication of the Constitution by the "Father of the Constitution." .
