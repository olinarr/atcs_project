'''Earl Benjamin''' "'''Ben'''" '''Nelson''' (born May 17, 1941) is the senior [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Nebraska]], serving since 2001. He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].  . 

Nelson entered politics in 1990, when he was elected the [[List of Governors of Nebraska|37th]] [[Governor of Nebraska]].  He was re-elected in 1994 with 74% of the vote. <ref name="nytimes1994">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E4DE1E39F933A25752C1A962958260 THE 1994 ELECTIONS: CONGRESS; Who Won Where - The Races For Governor - New York Times<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>  Nelson ran for an open seat in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] in 1996, losing to Republican [[Chuck Hagel]], and left the Governor's office in January 1999 due to term limits, after serving two full terms.  Nelson was elected to the U.S. Senate in the [[U.S. Senate election, 2000|2000 election]] after incumbent [[Bob Kerrey]] retired.  . 

On December 27, 2011, Nelson announced that he would not seek a third Senate term in 2012. <ref>Bresnahan, John.  [http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1211/70879.html "Ben Nelson retiring from Senate".]  [http://www.politico.com/ Politico.]  2011-12-27.  Retrieved 2011-12-27. </ref> . 

==Early life and career==. 
Nelson was born in [[McCook, Nebraska|McCook]], in southwestern Nebraska.  He is the only child of Birdella Ruby (née Henderson) and Benjamin Earl Nelson. <ref>[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/senators/nelsonben.htm 1<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref><ref name=whorunsgov>[http://www.whorunsgov.com/Profiles/Ben_Nelson "Ben Nelson (D-Neb.)"].  WhoRunsGov.com. Retrieved 2009-12-12. </ref> He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1963, a [[Master's degree|M.A.]] in 1965, and a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] in 1970 from the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]].  . 

Nelson made his name and money in the insurance industry. After graduating from law school, Nelson landed a job as assistant general counsel for Central National Insurance Group of Omaha. In 1975, he became state insurance director before going back to work for Central National Insurance as an executive vice president and eventually president. <ref name="Lincoln Journal Star 2000">Lincoln Journal Star, "Nelson's Past Motivates Crusade for Senate Seat," Oct. 1, 2000, page 1A</ref> He won his first elected office in 1990 when he became governor of Nebraska.  . 

In 2011, Nelson was named one of the wealthiest members of Congress, with an estimated net worth of at least $6.6 million.  He owns investment and rental properties in Nebraska, in Washington, and in Chicago; he and his wife both have significant holdings of [[Berkshire Hathaway]] stock. <ref>[http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/179087-the-hills-2011-50-wealthiest-congress-rish-list?start=48 "The Hill's 2011 50 Wealthiest in Congress".]  [http://thehill.com/ The Hill.]  2011-09-05.

==Political career== . 

In 1986, Nelson served as state chairman of Democrat [[Helen Boosalis]]'s gubernatorial campaign.  Boosalis was defeated by state treasurer [[Kay Orr]], who captured 53% of the vote to Boosalis's 47%. <ref name=chronicle>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/politics/election/2002nov/bios/sne1dem.dtl "Earl Benjamin Nelson".]  [http://www.sfgate.com/ ''San Francisco Chronicle''.]  Retrieved 2011-10-07. </ref><ref>Walton, Don.

===Governor===. 
Nelson was elected [[List of Governors of Nebraska|governor]] in the state's fourth-closest gubernatorial race in history in 1990. He was easily re-elected in 1994 with 74% of the vote – the largest margin of victory for a governor in half a century. <ref name="nytimes1994"/> During his first race for governor, Nelson ran against incumbent [[Kay A. Orr]], the first [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] woman to be elected Governor in United States history.  . 

During his tenure, Nelson cut spending from the previous administration by 64% while it was scheduled to rise by 13%. <ref>State of Nebraska Annual Budgetary Reports, 1987-1998</ref> He introduced legislation to cut crime through the Safe Streets Act and Juvenile Crime Bill, advocated for low-income families through the Kids Connection health care system, and enacted welfare reforms. He also cut taxes for over 400,000 middle income families in Nebraska. <ref name=autogenerated2>http://nationaljournal.com/pubs/almanac/2002/people/ne/nes2.htm</ref> . 

As governor, Nelson took some conservative stances on issues in right-leaning Nebraska. He pushed welfare reform before it was done at a national level and opposed President [[Bill Clinton]]'s efforts on health care. <ref>Lincoln Journal Star, Oct. 1, 2000, page 1A, "Nelson's Past Motivates Crusade for Senate Seat"</ref> . 

During the 1990 campaign, Nelson attacked Orr's support for a proposed low-level nuclear waste dump in the state. During his tenure, the Nebraska State Department of Environmental Quality denied the dump's application for an operating license, prompting a lawsuit that Nebraska settled for $145 million.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} . 

Nelson ran for a seat in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] in 1996 when fellow Democrat [[Jim Exon]] retired. He was soundly defeated by Republican businessman and Vietnam veteran [[Chuck Hagel]] in one of the political upsets of 1996.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} . 

In 1998, Nelson was ineligible to run for re-election because of Nebraska's term-limits law.  He was succeeded as governor by [[Mike Johanns]], the Republican mayor of [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]]. <ref>[http://www3.nationaljournal.com/members/campaign/1998/bios/johanns.htm "Michael Johanns (R)".]  [http://www3.nationaljournal.com/ National Journal.]  1998-11-04.

===Election to the Senate===. 
[[File:NELSONHOYER.jpg|thumb|right|Senator Ben Nelson with House Majority Leader [[Steny Hoyer]] (D-MD).]]
Nelson was again nominated by the Democrats for the Senate in the [[U.S. Senate election, 2000|2000 election]] after his fellow Democrat, incumbent [[Bob Kerrey]], announced his retirement.  His opponent was [[Nebraska Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Don Stenberg]]. Nelson won that election with 50.99% of the vote after a campaign in which he spent 50% more ($1,004,985) than his opponent. Despite initially pledging to work together,<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/news/vote2000/ne/main.htm Nelson, Hagel pledge to work together<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> Nelson and Hagel had a somewhat frosty relationship. <ref>[http://www.omaha.com/index.php?u_pg=1673&u_sid=2266334 Omaha.com Home Page<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> . 

In November 2004, it was widely rumored that President [[George W. Bush]] would choose Nelson as his [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|agriculture secretary]] in the cabinet. In the end, the position went to Nelson's gubernatorial successor, [[Mike Johanns]].  .

===Judicial appointments=== . 

Nelson was the lead Democratic Senator among the "[[Gang of 14]]," a bloc of 14 Senators who, on May 23, 2005, forged a compromise on the Democrats' use of the judicial [[filibuster]], thus blocking the Republican leadership's attempt to implement the so-called "[[nuclear option]]". Under the agreement among the Gang of 14, Democrats would retain the power to filibuster one of President George W. Bush's judicial nominees only in an "extraordinary circumstance", and the three most conservative Bush [[United States court of appeals|appellate court]] nominees ([[Janice Rogers Brown]], [[Priscilla Owen]] and [[William H. Pryor, Jr.|William Pryor]]) would receive a vote by the full Senate. Subsequently, he was the only Democrat to vote in favor of Brown; he was later the first Democratic senator to support [[Samuel Alito]]'s confirmation to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. Nelson also voted twice, with three other Democrats, to end Senate debate over Bush's [[United Nations]] Ambassador nominee [[John R. Bolton|John Bolton]].  . 

In an [[op-ed]] column, Nelson wrote: "The president's nominees, especially to the Supreme Court, deserve an up-or-down vote, even if the nominee isn't popular with the special-interest groups in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]."<ref>{{cite web| last = Adler| first = Jonathan| title = Nelson on Alito| publisher = ''[[National Review Online]]''| date = November 17, 2005| url = http://bench.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZmRjZjVhNTViODU2YjRiNzc3ZTEyMmJlMjE2Yzc4Zjc=| accessdate = 2009-05-15}}
</ref> . 

===Iraq===. 
On March 15, 2007, Nelson was one of two Democratic Senators to vote against invoking cloture on a resolution aimed at withdrawing most American combat troops from Iraq in 2008. The vote, requiring 60 votes to pass, was 50 to 48 against. <ref name="NYTimes">{{cite news

As a result of traveling to Iraq four times, the latest being in September 2007,<ref>[http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/have-you-been-to-iraq--76-sens.-say-they-have-2007-08-01.html TheHill.com - 'Have you been to Iraq?'{{ndash}} 76 sens. say they have<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> Nelson took the position that a transition of the mission was necessary in Iraq as opposed to a full withdrawal of troops. <ref name=autogenerated1>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0709/13/sitroom.01.html CNN.com - Transcripts<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>  His view was supported by the Jones Commission on September 6, 2007 when General [[James L. Jones]] presented a report to Congress claiming that, "The circumstances of the moment may continue to present the opportunity for considering a shift in the disposition and employment of our forces... such a strategy would include placing increasing responsibilities for the internal security of the nation on the ISF, especially in urban areas. Coalition forces could be re-tasked to better ensure the territorial defense of the state by increasingly concentrating on the eastern and western borders and the active defense of the critical infrastructures essential to Iraq."<ref>Jones Commission Report pg. 127, http://www.c-span.org/pdf/jonesreport090607.pdf</ref> The premise that stability in Iraq would only be achieved through political reconciliation acted on through legislation, a view long held by Nelson, was also recommended by Jones, reporting, "The future of Iraq ... hinges on the ability of the [[Iraqi people]] and the government to begin the process of achieving national reconciliation and to ending sectarian violence."<ref>Jones Commission Report pg. 130, http://www.c-span.org/pdf/jonesreport090607.pdf</ref> . 

In the spring of 2007, Senators Nelson, [[Susan Collins]] of [[Maine]], and [[John Warner]] of [[Virginia]] authored a list of measures, or "benchmarks", that were included in the Iraq Supplemental bill. These benchmarks allowed for progress to be measured in certain areas such as recognition of minority groups, strengthening of internal security forces, and equal distribution of oil revenue. President [[George W. Bush]] and General [[David Petraeus]] were then required to report on the advancement of these "benchmarks". <ref>[http://www.siouxcityjournal.com/articles/2007/03/16/news/nebraska/7a59d60ac1ed1029862572a00001b20b.txt Sioux City Journal: Nelson break ranks on Democratic call for Iraq pull out<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> . 

Nelson and Collins (a Republican) also introduced legislation on July 11, 2007 that would transition U.S. troops out of [[Baghdad]]. The legislation called for turning over internal security efforts to Iraqi forces after which time the U.S. military would secure the borders, protect the infrastructure, and continue to search for [[al-Qaeda]] forces. <ref name=autogenerated1 /> . 

===Taxes===. 
Nelson played a vital role in passing the [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001|2001 tax cut]]. In 2001, Nelson was one of a handful of Democratic Senators that helped craft the proposal to cut taxes by $1.3 trillion that was ultimately signed into law. In addition to passing the third-largest tax cut in American history, the compromise that Nelson supported freed up more funds for special education, agriculture, and defense spending. Provisions of the tax cut included immediate tax relief, accelerated tax relief for middle-income workers and a repeal of the estate tax. <ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9501E2D6103BF932A25756C0A9679C8B63 Congress Adopts Budget Proposal With Big Tax Cut - New York Times<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>  He was also the deciding vote for passage of the [[Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003|2003 tax cut]] which accelerated many of the provisions in the 2001 tax cut in addition to benefits for small businesses. As part of this tax package, Nelson teamed up with Senator Susan Collins to include fiscal relief for states suffering from the downturn in the economy. The final package included $20 billion to ensure that low-income families, children, seniors, and persons with disabilities were able to get the health and social services they needed from the state. <ref>Omaha World Herald, 5/16/2003, "Grassley, Nelson have helped shape tax-cut package in Senate"</ref> . 

In October 2009, the organization [[Americans for Tax Reform]] stated that Nelson was the only Democratic Senator who had signed their [[Taxpayer Protection Pledge]],<ref name ="ATR">{{cite web|title=The Taxpayer Protection Pledge Signers 112th Congressional List|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/atrfiles/files/files/091411-federalpledgesigners.pdf|publisher=Americans for Tax Reform|accessdate=November 30, 2011}}</ref> and launched an advocacy campaign to urge him to oppose the current [[America’s Healthy Future Act|health care reform proposals]] in Congress, which, they asserted, contained "billions of dollars in income tax hikes."<ref>Radman, Adam.

Retrieved November 6, 2009. </ref> . 

===Earmarks===. 
In July 2007, fellow Senator [[Tom Coburn]] criticized [[pork barrel spending]] Nelson had inserted into the 2007 defense spending bill. Coburn alleged that the earmarks would benefit Nelson's son Patrick's employer with millions in federal dollars and that the situation violated terms of the [[Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006]], which was passed by the Senate but has not yet been voted on in the House. Nelson's spokesperson said the Senator did nothing wrong<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,290532,00.html|title=Omaha Company's Windfall, Hiring of Lawmaker's Son Irks Senator|accessdate=2007-07-24 |author=Brendan Dougherty, Michael|publisher=Fox News|date=2007-07-24}}</ref> and was only acting under "an abundance of caution" when he withdrew the amendment after the new Senate Ethics Rules were passed. Some government watchdogs, including [[Public Citizen]], commented that the earmark probably didn't violate ethics rules. <ref>Omaha World Herald, 8/3/2007, "Future of Nelson earmarks unclear", http://www.omaha.com/index.php?u_page=2798&u_sid=10094581</ref>  Additionally, Coburn's motives were called into question by more than one publication, as his earmark blasts fell silent about his own state delegation's earmark requests. <ref>Omaha World Herald editorial 8/16/2007, The Oklahoman 8/6/2007, Senator attacks 'pork'; State avoids extra trims from Coburn</ref> . 

===Health care=== . 

In late 2009, the Senate's 40 Republicans unanimously opposed the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], the Senate's version of health-care legislation.  To end a Republican [[filibuster]] and pass the measure, the Democrats needed the votes of all 58 of their senators, plus those of two independents who caucused with their party.  Nelson was the 60th and last senator to agree to vote for cloture. <ref name=wapohealthdeal>Murray, Shailagh, and Lori Montgomery.  [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/19/AR2009121900797.html?sid=ST2009121900844 "Deal on health bill is reached".]  [http://www.washingtonpost.com/ ''Washington Post''.]  2009-12-20.

According to Nelson, he wanted to ensure that the final version of the law prohibited the use of public funds to pay for abortions. <ref>[http://bennelson.senate.gov/press/speeches/120709-02.cfm "Nelson Speaks on Senate Floor About Nelson–Hatch Amendment".]  Transcript of Nelson's remarks on Senate floor; press release on [http://bennelson.senate.gov/index.cfm Nelson's Senate website.]  2009-12-07. Retrieved 2010-04-26. </ref>
His [[cloture vote]] came after the measure was amended to permit states to opt out of allowing insurance exchange plans to provide abortion coverage.  Persons enrolling in plans that covered abortion costs would pay for that coverage separately from their payment for the rest of the plan. <ref>Kane, Paul.

Retrieved 2010-04-26. </ref>  
The bill also provided full and permanent federal reimbursement for the expenses that Nebraska would incur in its mandated expansion of Medicaid eligibility,<ref name=wapohealthdeal /> 
an amount estimated by the [[Congressional Budget Office]] at $100 million. <ref>O'Brien, Michael.

Retrieved 2010-04-26. </ref> . 

The health-care measure was controversial, and Nelson's vote provoked a strong response.  The Medicaid reimbursement scheme was derided by the measure's opponents as the "[[Nebraska Compromise|Cornhusker Kickback]]". <ref>Frates, Chris.

Among those denouncing the provision was [[Dave Heineman]], Nebraska's Republican governor. <ref>Hayworth, Bret.

[[Pro-life]] organizations also responded negatively to Nelson's vote.  Nebraska Right to Life decried the anti-abortion language in the health-care bill as "bogus",<ref name=betrayed />
and in April 2010 declared that they would never again give their endorsement to Nelson. <ref>Walton, Don.

Nelson's popularity fell among Nebraskans in the wake of his cloture vote.  A December 2009 [[Rasmussen Reports|Rasmussen]] poll indicated that in a hypothetical Nelson–Heineman race, the Republican would get 61% of the vote to Nelson's 30%.  In the same poll, 64% of the Nebraska voters surveyed were opposed to the health-care bill. <ref>[http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections2/election_2012/nebraska/election_2012_nebraska_senate "Election 2012: Nebraska Senate"]  [http://www.rasmussenreports.com/ Rasmussen Reports.]  2009-12-29.

With the victory of Republican [[Scott Brown]] in the special election to fill the Senate seat vacated by the death of Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]], the Democrats lost their filibuster-proof majority.

The measure as ultimately passed eliminated the special Medicaid reimbursement for Nebraska, as Nelson had requested in a letter to Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]] about a month after his crucial cloture vote. <ref name=toast />  Nelson stated that his opposition to the final measure arose from newly-added provisions related to [[student loans]],<ref name=nelsonvotesno /> which would adversely affect Nebraska-based student-lending firm [[Nelnet]]. <ref>Morton, Joseph.

===Other votes===. 
Nelson's votes in the Senate have often placed him at odds with the leadership of his party.  A ''[[National Journal]]'' congressional vote rating from 2006 placed him to the right of five Senate Republicans ([[Gordon Smith (politician)|Gordon Smith]], [[Olympia Snowe]], [[Arlen Specter]], [[Susan Collins]], and [[Lincoln Chafee]]). [[Mary Landrieu]] was the only other Democrat to place to the right of any Republicans (she placed to the right of Chafee). <ref>http://nationaljournal.com/voteratings/pdf/Centrists.pdf</ref> A similar 2007 National Journal congressional vote rating went even
further, placing him to the right of eight Senate Republicans (the
above five as well as [[Richard Lugar]], [[Norm Coleman]], and [[Mike DeWine]]), with Landrieu once again placing to the right of Chafee and
being the only other Democrat to place to the right of any Republicans. <ref>[http://nationaljournal.com/voteratings/sen/cons.htm NATIONAL JOURNAL: 2007 Vote Ratings (03/07/2007)<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> Most recently, the [[American Conservative Union]] rated his overall performance for 2010 at 48 percent, the highest given to any Democratic senator. <ref>[http://www.conservative.org/ratings/ratingsarchive/2010/House-Senate-combo.htm#NE]  [http://www.conservative.org/ The American Conservative Union.]  Retrieved 2011-04-20. </ref> . 

Nelson was one of only two Democratic senators to vote against the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] of 2002. Nelson is strongly opposed to replacing the income tax with a national sales tax, a position that increasingly finds favor with many conservatives. He has voted with Republicans on matters of bankruptcy reform, environmental protection, lawsuit reform, and trade. In 2004 he was one of only three Democratic senators to vote to invoke [[cloture]] on the proposed [[Federal Marriage Amendment]]; in 2006 he was one of only two Democratic Senators to vote that way. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=1&vote=00129 |title=U.S. Senate: Legislation & Records Home > Votes > Roll Call Vote |publisher=Senate.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=1&vote=00142 |title=U.S. Senate: Legislation & Records Home > Votes > Roll Call Vote |publisher=Senate.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> He was the only Democratic senator to vote against a 2006 bill that would have extended federal funding for [[Stem Cell Research]]. He has, however, voted consistently against drilling in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]]. He has also opposed President Bush's plan to send an additional 21,500 troops to Iraq. <ref>[http://bennelson.senate.gov/news/details.cfm?id=267812&& ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> Early in Bush's first term he voted with the majority of his party against scrapping President [[Bill Clinton]]'s expansive new rules on ergonomics regulation for workers; many of his fellow conservative Democrats like [[John Breaux]], [[Max Baucus]], [[Blanche Lincoln]], and [[Zell Miller]] voted with Republicans on the issue.  On April 26, 2010, Nelson was one of two Democratic senators in attendance to vote against the motion to move a financial regulations bill forward, siding with Senate Republicans.  The other was [[Harry Reid]], who voted against his own proposed bill out of procedure.  . 

On August 5, 2010, Nelson was the only Democrat to vote against [[Elena Kagan]] for confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court. <ref>[http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2010/08/supreme-court-justice-elena-kagan-confirmed-by-senate/1 USA Today article on Elena Kagan's confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court]</ref> . 

On December 18, 2010, Nelson voted in favor of the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]]. <ref>[http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/111/senate/2/281?ref=politics "Senate Vote 281 - Repeals ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’".]  [http://www.nytimes.com/ ''New York Times''.]  2011-01-26.

==2006 re-election campaign==. 
{{Main|United States Senate election in Nebraska, 2006}}
[[File:NESen06County.png|thumb|Election results by county for Nelson's 2006 reelection bid]] . 

Nelson was thought to be in danger of losing his seat in [[United States Senate elections, 2006|2006]], as it was thought his successor as governor, [[Mike Johanns]], was almost certain to run against him. However, that speculation ended when Johanns was appointed [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|U.S. Secretary of Agriculture]]. With Johanns' move to Washington, few high-profile Republicans stepped up to run against Nelson, as the state party focused its attention on the [[Nebraska gubernatorial election, 2006|governor's race]]. The Republican nomination was won by [[Pete Ricketts]], a former [[TD Ameritrade]] executive.  . 

In the general election, Nelson was endorsed by the [[National Rifle Association]], Nebraska Right to Life ([[National Right to Life]]'s state affiliate),<ref>http://www.journalstar.com/articles/2006/07/18/local/doc44bc07ad13290863899288.prt</ref> Nebraskans United for Life,<ref>[http://www.nebraskansunitedforlife.org/2006.htm#2006 ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> the [[United States Chamber of Commerce|U.S. Chamber of Commerce]], the [[National Federation of Independent Businesses]],<ref>http://www.journalstar.com/articles/2006/05/30/local/doc447cbf008219e179974789.txt</ref> Nebraska Farmers Union PAC, [[National Farmers Union (United States)|National Farmers Union]] PAC, the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] PAC, the Business-Industry Political Action Committee, and the Omaha Police Union, all of which are conservative-leaning groups.  . 

Nelson easily defeated Ricketts 64-36%, the highest victory margin for a Democratic Senate candidate in Nebraska since [[Edward Zorinsky]] won 66 percent of the vote in his 1982 reelection bid. <ref>[http://www.omaha.com/index.php?u_pg=1673&u_sid=2276806&u_rnd=3460094 ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> In doing so, he received the votes of 42% of Republicans and 73% of Independents on top of 96% of those from his own party. He also won all but 13 counties in the western part of the state, a surprising feat in normally heavily Republican Nebraska. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006//pages/results/states/NE/S/01/epolls.0.html |title=Elections 2006 |publisher=CNN.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006//pages/results/states/NE/S/01/map.html |title=Elections 2006 |publisher=CNN.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> .
