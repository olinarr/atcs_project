====Gulf of Mexico oil spill====. 
On April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore [[drilling rig]] at the [[Macondo Prospect]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], causing a [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|major sustained oil leak]]. The well's operator, [[BP]], initiated a containment and cleanup plan, and began drilling two [[relief well]]s intended to stop the flow. Obama visited the Gulf on May 2 among visits by members of his cabinet, and again on May 28 and June 4. On May 22 he announced a federal investigation and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] [[Ken Salazar]] and concurrent Congressional hearings. On May 27, he announced a 6-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review. <ref>{{Cite news|title=Obama Halts Drilling Projects, Defends Actions|work=National Public Radio|date=May 27, 2010|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127205462&ps=rs}}</ref> As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government. <ref>{{Cite news|first=Patrik|last=Jonsson|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0529/Gulf-oil-spill-Obama-s-big-political-test|title=Gulf oil spill: Obama's big political test|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=May 29, 2010|accessdate=June 6, 2010}}</ref> .

====Israel====. 
[[File:Barack Obama welcomes Shimon Peres in the Oval Office.jpg|thumb|right|Obama meeting with Israeli President [[Shimon Peres]], 2009]]
During the initial years of the Obama administration, the U.S. increased military cooperation with Israel, including a record number of U.S. troops participating in military exercises in the country, increased military aid, and the re-establishment of the [[Joint Political Military Group|U.S.-Israeli Joint Political Military Group]] and the Defense Policy Advisory Group. It was reported high-ranking defense officials from both countries had been making an unusual number of trips between the two countries, including [[Ehud Barak]]. Part of the military aid increase in 2010 was to fund Israel's missile defense shield. Before his retirement in September 2011, Adm. Mike Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made four trips to Israel during his four-year tenure, two of them in 2010. Prior to 2007 no Chairman of the Joint Chiefs had done so for over ten years. <ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703321004575427272550050504.html "U.S., Israel Build Military Cooperation"], Charles Levinson.

===Religious views===. 
Obama is a Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life. He wrote in ''[[The Audacity of Hope]]'' that he "was not raised in a religious household". He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents (whom Obama has specified elsewhere as "non-practicing Methodists and Baptists"), to be detached from religion, yet "in many ways the most spiritually awakened person that I have ever known". He described his father as "raised a Muslim", but a "confirmed atheist" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as "a man who saw religion as not particularly useful". Obama explained how, through working with [[black church]]es as a [[Community organizing|community organizer]] while in his twenties, he came to understand "the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change". <ref name="social change"/> . 

In an interview with the evangelical periodical ''[[Christianity Today]]'', Obama stated: "I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe that that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life."<ref>[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2008/januaryweb-only/104-32.0.html?start=2 Christianity Today: "Q&A: Barack Obama"] Interview by Sarah Pulliam and Ted Olsen, January 23, 2008</ref> . 

On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying "I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't—frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead—being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me."<ref name="APbychoice">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/28/obama-christian-by-choice_n_742124.html?view=print Obama 'Christian By Choice': President Responds To Questioner] by Charles Babington and Darlene Superville, [[Associated Press]], September 28, 2010</ref><ref name="ABCVideobychoice">Video&nbsp;– [http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2010/09/president-obama-i-am-a-christian-by-choicethe-precepts-of-jesus-spoke-to-me.html President Obama: "I am a Christian By Choice"] by [[ABC News]], September 29, 2010</ref> .
