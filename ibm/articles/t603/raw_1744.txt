His warnings of impending [[economic crisis]] and a loss of confidence in the dollar in 2005 and 2006 were at the time derided by many economists, but accelerating dollar devaluation in 2007 led experts like former Federal Reserve chair [[Alan Greenspan]] to reconsider [[hard money (policy)|hard money]] policies such as those of Paul. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/41702/page/3|title=The World in 2030: Greenspan charts our economic course in 'The Age of Turbulence'.

===Lower spending and smaller government===. 
Paul believes the size of the federal government must be decreased substantially. In order to restrict the federal government to what he believes are its [[Constitutionalism|Constitutionally authorized functions]], he regularly votes against almost all proposals for new [[government spending]], [[initiative]]s, or [[taxes]],<ref name="saynot">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/08/AR2006070800966_2.html|title=Congressman Paul's Legislative Strategy?

For example, on January 22, 2007, Paul was the lone member out of 415<ref>{{cite news|url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/110/house/1/votes/45/|title=110th Congress, 1st session, House Vote 45|work=Washington Post|accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref> voting to oppose a House measure to create a [[NARA|National Archives]] exhibit on [[slavery in the U.S.|slavery]] and [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], seeing this as an unauthorized use of taxpayer money.  . 

Paul advocates substantially reducing the government's role in individual lives and in the functions of foreign and domestic [[State (polity)|states]]; he says [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] have lost their commitment to [[limited government]] and have become the party of [[big government]]. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul263.html|last=Paul|first=Ron|title=The Republican Congress Wastes Billions Overseas|publisher=House of Representatives|work=[[Congressional Record]]|date=2005-07-20|accessdate=2007-10-23}}</ref> His 2012 "Plan to Restore America"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ronpaul2012.com/the-issues/ron-paul-plan-to-restore-america/ |title=Ron Paul 'Plan to Restore America'|publisher=Ron Paul 2012 Presidential Campaign Committee |accessdate=January 11, 2012}}</ref> would eliminate five Cabinet-level departments: [[U.S. Department of Energy|Energy]], [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development|HUD]], [[U.S. Department of Commerce|Commerce]], [[U.S. Department of the Interior|Interior]], and [[U.S. Department of Education|Education]].  He has called for elimination of other federal agencies such as the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]],<ref name="google interview"/> and the [[Internal Revenue Service]],<ref name="endthefed"/> calling them "unnecessary bureaucracies". Paul would severely reduce the role of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]; reducing its functions to intelligence-gathering. He would eliminate operations like overthrowing foreign governments and assassinations. He says this activity is kept secret even from Congress and "leads to trouble". <ref>Interview with Ron Paul on PBS Newshour, 2007-10-12. </ref> He also commented, "We have every right in the world to know something about intelligence gathering, but we have to have intelligent people interpreting this information."<ref>September 5 Presidential Debate on Fox News Channel. </ref> . 

Paul calls for the elimination of the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA), which is tasked with coordinating preparedness and relief for natural disasters. He regards the argument for FEMA as “symptomatic of a blind belief in big government's ability to do anything and everything for anyone and everyone....  When people are starving, injured and dying they need speed and efficiency, yet FEMA comes along with forms and policies and rubber stamps.”<ref name=TSTFEMA>{{cite web|last=Paul|first=Ron|title=We're from the Government.

In a speech on June 25, 2003, criticizing giving [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Tony Blair]] a [[Congressional Gold Medal]] of Honor, Paul said, "These medals generally have been proposed to recognize a life of service and leadership, and not for political reasons—as evidenced by the overwhelming bipartisan support for awarding President Reagan, a Republican, a gold medal. These awards normally go to deserving individuals, which is why I have many times offered to contribute $100 of my own money, to be matched by other members, to finance these medals."<ref name="cmh">{{cite news|url=http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2003/cr062503.htm|title=Does Tony Blair Deserve a Congressional Medal?|publisher=House of Representatives|accessdate=2007-03-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070303215217/http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2003/cr062503.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-03-03}}</ref> ''Texas Monthly'' awarded him the "Bum Steer" award for voting against a congressional honor for [[cartoonist]] [[Charles Schulz]], but also noted, "When he was criticized for voting against the [Parks] medal, he chided his colleagues by challenging them to personally contribute $100 to mint the medal.

For example, during 2007, he requested about $400 million in earmarks in bills he voted against. <ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,292334,00.html Fox news earmark report]</ref> A spokesman in the Fox News article says, "Reducing earmarks does not reduce government spending, and it does not prohibit spending upon those things that are earmarked. What people who push earmark reform are doing is they are particularly misleading the public—and I have to presume it's not by accident." One group supporting fiscal conservatism<ref name="cfg"/> finds Paul's actions with earmarks to be contradictory and cites his 2003 speech regarding the award of a Congressional Gold Medal, at which time the Congressman declared, "I will continue in my uncompromising opposition to appropriations not authorized within the enumerated powers of the Constitution;"<ref name="cmh" /> however, Paul himself has inserted appropriations for projects such as the renovation of a movie theater and subsidies for the shrimp industry, whereas reportedly, "neither of which is envisioned in the Constitution as an essential government function". <ref name="chron"/> The Congressman has responded to criticism about earmarks by providing an explanation in his weekly column.

===The Plan To Restore America  (Budget for 2013)===. 
In October 2011, Paul released a federal budget proposal for 2013, entitled the “Plan to Restore America.”<ref name=RPBudget>{{cite web|title=Ron Paul "Plan to Restore America"|url=http://www.ronpaul2012.com/the-issues/ron-paul-plan-to-restore-america/|accessdate=25 January 2012}}</ref><ref name=BudgetPolitico>{{cite journal|last=Hirschhorn|first=Dan|title=Ron Paul Proposes $1T in Specific Budget Cuts|journal=Politico|date=2011-10-17|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1011/66114.html|accessdate=25 January 2012}}</ref><ref name=BudgetNPR>{{cite news|last=James|first=Frank|title=Ron Paul Proposes $1 Trillion in Cuts His First Year in the White House|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2011/10/17/141443375/ron-paul-proposes-1-trillion-cut-his-first-year-in-white-house|accessdate=25 January 2012|newspaper=NPR|date=2011-10-17}}</ref> The plan calls for cutting $1 trillion from the federal budget in the first year, along with other measures which Paul says would balance the federal budget within 3 years. To achieve these goals, the plan would seek . 

Spending Cuts
* eliminate 5 cabinet-level agencies ([[United States Department of Education|Education]], [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior]], [[United States Department of Commerce|Commerce]], [[United States Department of Energy|Energy]], and [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|Housing and Urban Development]])
* privatize the [[FAA]] and the [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]]
* cut the federal workforce by 10%
* cut funding (down from 2006 levels) for the
:: [[Food and Drug Administration]] by 40%
:: [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control]] by 20%
:: [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] by 20%
:: [[National Institutes of Health]] by 20%
:: [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] by 30%
:: [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] by 20%
* cut the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] budget by total 15%; eliminate all foreign war funding
* freeze funding for most other federal agencies at 2006 levels
* eliminate all foreign aid
* eliminate international drug programs
* substantially reduce foreign travel
* eliminate international organizations and commissions
* administer [[Medicaid]] and other joint federal-state social welfare programs ([[State Children's Health Insurance Program|SCHIP]], food stamps, etc) through [[block grant|block-grant]] funding mechanisms to the states . 

Revenue Changes
* cut the top corporate tax rate to 15%  (down from 35%)
* allow companies to repatriate capital without additional taxation
* permanently extend the [[Bush tax cuts|Bush administration tax cuts]]
* eliminate capital gains and dividends taxes
* eliminate estate and gift taxes
* end taxes on personal savings
* sell federal lands and other federal assets . 

Other Economic and Regulatory Measures
* repeal the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|new healthcare law ("Obamacare")]] as well as the [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Dodd-Frank]] and [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act|Sarbanes-Oxley]] financial services and banking regulations
* cancel certain "onerous" regulations instituted under executive order by previous presidents
* conduct a full audit of the Federal Reserve
* seek competing currency legislation "to strengthen the dollar and stabilize inflation" . 

[[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] commitments to older workers and retirees would be honored, while workers younger than 25 would be given the option to opt out of participating in these programs. 
The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] would be the only agency whose funds would be maintained at current levels of growth. 
Federal-state social welfare programs like Medicaid would be shifted from the mandatory section of the budget to the discretionary section, so that Congress would need to approve funding allocations each year. <ref name=BudgetUSNews>{{cite news|last=Kim|first=Mallie Jane|title=Ron Paul $1 Trillion Cut Plan Targets Five Cabinet Departments|url=http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2011/10/17/ron-paul-1-trillion-cut-plan-targets-five-cabinet-departments|accessdate=25 January 2012|newspaper=US News and World Report|date=2011-10-17}}</ref> . 

The president's salary would be cut from $400,000 to approximately $39,000 per year (the median personal income of the American worker), and Congressional pay and perks would be slashed.  . 

Paul has stressed that certain essential responsibilities currently performed by agencies which he proposes to eliminate would be assumed by remaining agencies, or in the case of aviation management (FAA and TSA), would be transferred to the private sector. <ref>{{cite news|last=Paul|first=Ron|title=The Truth about My Student Loan Program|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/story/2011-10-27/ron-paul-budget-plan/50963452/1|accessdate=25 January 2012|newspaper=USA Today|date=2011-10-27}}</ref> . 

Although Paul has often said that his ultimate goal is to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and eliminate the income tax, the Plan to Restore America does not address that specific goal.  . 

On the unveiling of the plan, critics were quick to remark on the negative consequences that changes in the budget of the magnitude being proposed could have in the short term on the economy. [[Kevin Hassett]], economic policy director of the [[American Enterprise Institute]] and chief economic adviser to John McCain's 2000 presidential campaign, praised Paul's aim of reducing the size of government, but worried that, "At the scale he’s talking about, it’s unlikely you could have an immediate reduction in government without hurtling the economy into recession." <ref name=BudgetWaPo>{{cite news|last=Khimm|first=Suzy|title=Ron Paul's Economic Plan|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/ron-pauls-economic-plan/2011/10/17/gIQAPqTYsL_blog.html|accessdate=25 January 2012|newspaper=Washington Post|date=2011-10-18}}</ref> Economist [[Dean Baker]], of the [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]], said that "This is almost having the economy fall off a cliff."<ref name=BudgetWaPo /> .

In the words of the ''[[New York Times]]'', Paul is "not a fan" of the [[Federal Reserve]]. <ref>Chan, Sewell (2010-12-11) [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/weekinreview/12chan.html?src=twrhp The Fed? Ron Paul's Not a Fan], ''[[New York Times]]''</ref> Paul's opposition to the Fed is supported by the [[Austrian Business Cycle Theory]], which holds that instead of containing inflation, by which it means [[monetary inflation]] rather than [[price inflation]], the Federal Reserve, in theory and in practice, is responsible for causing monetary inflation, which in turn usually causes price inflation. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/goldstandard.html|title=Is the Gold Standard History?|author=[[Lew Rockwell|Rockwell, Lew]]|date=2002-09-14|accessdate=2008-02-08|publisher=[[Lew Rockwell]]}}</ref> In addition to eroding the value of individual savings, this creation of monetary inflation leads to [[boom and bust|booms and busts]] in the economy. Thus Paul argues that government, via a [[central bank]] (the Federal Reserve), is the primary cause of economic [[recession]]s and depressions. He believes that economic volatility is decreased when the [[free market]] determines interest rates and money supply. <ref>{{cite news|first=Ron|last=Paul|date=2007-09-11|accessdate=2007-10-23|title=Question and Answer session following Keynote speech at the Johns Hopkins Paul H.

In 1982, Paul was the prime mover in the creation of the [[U.S. Gold Commission]], and in many public speeches Paul has voiced [[Criticism of fractional-reserve banking|concern]] over the dominance of the current [[fractional-reserve banking|banking]] system and called for the return to a [[Hard money (policy)|commodity-backed currency]] through a gradual reintroduction of hard currency, including both gold and silver. <ref name="nyxm"/> A [[commodity]] standard binds [[currency]] issue to the value of that commodity rather than [[Fiat currency|fiat]], making the value of the currency as stable as the commodity.  .

He argues that [[hard money (policy)|hard money]], such as backed by gold or silver, would prevent monetary inflation (and, thus, would inhibit price inflation), but adds, "I wouldn't exactly go back on the gold standard but I would legalize the constitution where gold and silver should and could be [[legal tender]], which would restrain the Federal Government from spending and then turning that over to the Federal Reserve and letting the Federal Reserve print the money."<ref>Interview with Ron Paul after New Hampshire presidential debate on June 5, 2007.

He suggests that current efforts to sustain [[dollar hegemony]], especially since the collapse of the [[Bretton Woods system]] following the United States' suspension of the dollar's conversion to gold in 1971, exacerbate a rationale for war. Consequently, when petroleum producing nations like Iraq, Iran, or Venezuela elect to trade in [[Petroeuro]] instead of [[Petrodollar]], it devalues an already overly inflated dollar, further eroding its supremacy as a global currency. According to Paul, along with vested American interests in oil and plans to "remake the Middle East", this scenario has proven a contributing factor for the war in Iraq and diplomatic tensions with Iran. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2006/cr021506.htm|title=The End of Dollar Hegemony|publisher=House of Representatives|accessdate=2007-03-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070303220038/http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2006/cr021506.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-03-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://recap.fednet.net/archive/Buildasx.asp?sProxy=80_hflr021506a_050.wmv,80_hflr021506a_051.wmv,80_hflr021506a_052.wmv,80_hflr021506a_053.wmv,80_hflr021506a_054.wmv,80_hflr021506a_055.wmv,80_hflr021506a_056.wmv&sTime=00:02:06.0&eTime=00:02:54&duration=00:30:42.0&UserName=reppaultx&sLocation=G&sExpire=0|title=Postcongressional video content|publisher=fednet.net|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060504043753/http://recap.fednet.net/archive/Buildasx.asp?sProxy=80_hflr021506a_050.wmv,80_hflr021506a_051.wmv,80_hflr021506a_052.wmv,80_hflr021506a_053.wmv,80_hflr021506a_054.wmv,80_hflr021506a_055.wmv,80_hflr021506a_056.wmv&sTime=00:02:06.0&eTime=00:02:54&duration=00:30:42.0&UserName=reppaultx&sLocation=G&sExpire=0|archivedate=2006-05-04|accessdate=2011-12-18}}</ref> .

Following the passage of the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act|McCain-Feingold]] campaign finance reform law, he wrote, "First, although the new campaign rules clearly violate the First amendment, they should be struck down primarily because Congress has no authority under Article I of the Constitution to regulate campaigns at all.  Article II authorizes only the regulation of elections, not campaigns, because our Founders knew Congress might pass campaign laws that protect incumbency."<ref>{{cite news|last=Paul|first=Ron|title='Campaign Finance Reform' Muzzles Political Dissent|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20031225160514/http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst2003/tst122203.htm|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=Texas Straight Talk|date=2003-12-23}}</ref>  . 

In 2002, he also joined with others to sue the [[Federal Election Commission]] over provisions of the McCain-Feingold law, arguing for his part that it was a violation of his First Amendment rights for the government to subject him, as a federal elected official seeking re-election, to more stringent campaign requirements, including limitations on the financial contributions he could receive from individual donors, than were placed on news media corporations that were taking positions on public policy issues relevant to campaigns. <ref>{{cite web|title=Paul v.

Commenting on the Supreme Court's ruling in [[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission|Citizens United]], in 2010 Paul said, "You should never restrict lobbying because the Constitution is rather clear about the people being allowed to petition Congress, and whether you're an individual or you belong to a [special interest group] ... you should be allowed to do that."<ref name=Mercola>{{cite news|title=Ron Paul interview by Joseph Mercola|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-IvckPzn8M&feature=channel|accessdate=29 February 2012|date=2010-02-01}}</ref>  He argues that corporations should be able to spend their money in any way that they want. <ref name=Mercola/> He also opposes taxpayer-funded public campaign financing. <ref name=LibDefCampFN>{{cite book|last=Paul|first=Ron|title=Liberty Defined: 50 Essential Issues That Affect Our Freedom|year=2011|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|location=New York|pages=28-31}}</ref> . 

Paul rejects the notion that corporations are people, with collective rights. He says that only individuals have rights; people are individuals, not groups or companies. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHOAH1i7RuI |title=Ron Paul: Corporations are not people |date=January 10, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Keyes|first=Scott|coauthors=Waldron, Travis|title=Ron Paul Breaks with Mitt Romney: 'People are Individuals ...

;Immunity for Whistleblowers . 

At a campaign rally, Paul said that whistleblowers are "the ones who need immunity." Alluding to [[Daniel Ellsberg]] and [[Bradley Manning]], Paul said, "So if we have an American citizen and is willing to take the consequences and practice civil disobedience and say this is what our government's doing, should he be locked up and in prison, or should we see him as a political hero? Maybe he is a true patriot who reveals what's going on in government."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/286472/ron-paul-maybe-wikileakers-are-true-patriots-patrick-brennan|title=Ron Paul: Maybe Wikileakers Are ‘True Patriots'| publisher=National Review Online | date=2011-12-21}}</ref> However, Paul voted against the Offshore Oil and Gas Worker Whistleblower Protection Act of 2010. <ref>{{cite web|title=H.R. 5851: Offshore Oil and Gas Worker Whistleblower Protection Act of 2010|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/vote.xpd?vote=h2010-506|work=House Vote #506, 111th Congress, 2010-07-30|accessdate=2 February 2012}}</ref> . 

===Gun control===. 
Paul has been a lead sponsor of legislation in Congress attempting to maintain individual [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] rights. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gunowners.org/op0636.htm|title=John Dingell -- Congressional Chameleon|last=Pratt|first=Larry|month=September | year=2006|accessdate=2008-10-30}}</ref> He has also fought for the right of [[Aviator|pilots]] to be armed.  . 

In the first chapter of his book, ''Freedom Under Siege'', Paul argued that the purpose of the Second Amendment is to place a check on government [[Tyrant|tyranny]], not to merely grant [[hunting]] rights or allow [[self-defense]]. When asked whether individuals should be allowed to own [[machine gun]]s, Paul responded, "Whether it's an [[automatic weapon]] or not is, I think, irrelevant."<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCM_wQy4YVg Q&A session at Google] time 14:40-16:00</ref> Paul also argues that weapons bans only keep them out of the hands of law abiding citizens, not dangerous criminals. <ref>[http://www.ronpaullibrary.org/document.php?id=301 Assault Weapons and Assaults on the Constitution] Texas Straight Talk</ref> He sees school shootings, plane hijackings, and other such events as a result of prohibitions on self-defense. <ref>[http://www.ronpaullibrary.org/document.php?id=509 Security and Liberty] Texas Straight Talk</ref>  He supports the right of citizens to carry concealed weapons if they are legally owned. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vote-smart.org/npat.php?can_id=296 |title=Project Vote Smart |publisher=Vote-smart.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref> . 

====Jury related issues====. 
Paul believes that [[juries]] deserve the status of [[tribunal]]s, and that jurors have the right to [[Jury nullification|judge the law]] as well as the facts of the case. "The concept of protecting individual rights from the heavy hand of government through the common-law jury is as old as the [[Magna Carta]]. The Founding Fathers were keenly aware of this principle and incorporated it into our Constitution." He notes that this principle is also stated in [[Thomas Paine]]'s ''[[Rights of Man]]'', [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decisions by [[Chief Justice]] [[John Jay]], and writings of [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Paul states that [[judge]]s were not given the right to direct the trial by "instructing" the jury. <ref>{{cite book|author=Paul, Ron|title=Freedom Under Siege: The U.S. Constitution After 200&nbsp;Years|year=1987|publisher=Foundation for Rational Economics and Education|location=Lake Jackson, TX|url=http://www.dailypaul.com/freedom-under-siege/Freedom-Under-Siege-complete.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070620214606/http://www.dailypaul.com/freedom-under-siege/Freedom-Under-Siege-complete.pdf|archivedate=2007-06-20|accessdate=2007-10-23|pages=23–27}}</ref> . 

===Habeas corpus===. 
In the first Republican debate (2007) in California, Paul stated that he would never violate ''[[habeas corpus]]'',<ref name="sullivanhabeas">{{cite web|url=http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2007/05/taking_ron_paul.html|title=Taking Ron Paul Seriously|accessdate=2007-10-23|last=Sullivan|first=Andrew|date=2007-05-11|publisher=[[Atlantic Monthly]]|work=Daily Dish}}</ref> through which detainees can seek relief from unlawful imprisonment.

===Sexual harassment=== . 

In his 1987 book, Freedom Under Siege, Ron Paul expressed the view that those who experience sexual harassment in the work force should remedy the situation by quitting their jobs. He further argued that governmental oversight is warranted only where victims are physically forced into sexual actions. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} . 

===Same-sex marriage===. 
Asked his opinion on [[same-sex marriage]] in October 2011, Paul replied, “Biblically and historically, the government was very uninvolved in marriage. I like that. I don't know why we should register our marriage to the federal government. I think it's a sacrament.” In the same interview, when asked whether he would vote for or against a state constitutional amendment like California's [[Proposition 8]], he said, “Well, I believe marriage is between one man and one woman.”<ref>{{cite news|last=Bailey|first=Sarah Pulliam|title=Q & A: Ron Paul on Leaving the Episcopal Church, and Whether to Legislate Abortion, Narcotics, and Same-Sex Marriage|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2011/octoberweb-only/ron-paul-church-abortion-narcotics-marriage.html|accessdate=26 January 2012|newspaper=Christianity Today|date=2011-10-10}}</ref> . 

In a 2007 interview, Paul said that he supported the right of gay couples to marry, so long as they didn't "impose" their relationship on anyone else, on the grounds of supporting voluntary associations. <ref>{{cite news|title='Ron Paul Unplugged' interview with John Stossel|newspaper=ABC News "20/20"|date=2007-12-07}}</ref>  He also said, "Matter of fact, I'd like to see all governments out of the marriage question. I don't think it's a state function, I think it's a religious function." Paul has stated that in a best case scenario, governments would enforce contracts and grant divorces but otherwise have no say in marriage. <ref name="gaymarriage">{{cite web|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul160.html|title=Eliminate Federal Court Jurisdiction|accessdate=2007-06-06|last=Paul|first=Ron|date=2004-03-02 }}</ref> He has also said he doesn't want to interfere in the free association of two individuals in a social, sexual, and religious sense. <ref name="atgoogle">{{cite news|title=Candidates@Google: Ron Paul|publisher=[[Google]]|date=2007-07-13|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCM_wQy4YVg|accessdate=2007-10-23}}</ref><ref name="nhdebate">{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0706/05/se.01.html|title=Transcript of June 5 "CNN/WMUR/''New Hampshire Union Leader'' Republican presidential debate"|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2007-10-23|date=2007-06-05}}</ref> When asked if he was supportive of gay marriage, Paul responded, "I am supportive of all voluntary associations and people can call it whatever they want."<ref name="atgoogle"/> . 

Paul has also said that at the federal level he opposes “efforts to redefine marriage as something other than a union between one man and one woman.” He believes that recognizing or legislating marriages should be left to the states and local communities, and not subjected to "[[judicial activism]]."<ref name="cultural_conservatives">{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2004/cr093004.htm|title=Cultural Conservatives Lose if Gay Marriage is Federalized|accessdate=2007-03-02|last=Paul|first=Ron|date=2004-09-30 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070207225148/http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2004/cr093004.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-02-07}}</ref> He has said that for these reasons he would have voted for the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], had he been in Congress in 1996. The act allows a state to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states or countries, although a state will usually recognize marriages performed outside of its own jurisdiction. The act also prohibits the U.S. Government from recognizing same-sex marriages, even if a state recognizes the marriage.  . 

He has opposed the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]], which would amend the US Constitution to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman, because he worries that with its passage “liberal social engineers who wish to use federal government power to redefine marriage will be able to point to the constitutional marriage amendment as proof that the definition of marriage is indeed a federal matter!  I am unwilling either to cede to federal courts the authority to redefine marriage, or to deny a state’s ability to preserve the traditional definition of marriage.”<ref name=cultural_conservatives /> . 

Paul has been a cosponsor of the [[Marriage Protection Act]] in each Congress since the bill's original introduction. It would bar federal judges from hearing cases pertaining to the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act. Speaking in support of the Marriage Protection Act in 2004, he urged those of his fellow congressional representatives who “believe Congress needs to take immediate action to protect marriage” to vote for the bill because its passage, requiring only simple majorities in both Houses of Congress, would be much more readily achieved than the passage of the Federal Marriage Amendment, which, as a Constitutional amendment, would require not only much larger majorities in both Houses but also ratification by the state legislatures. <ref name=cultural_conservatives /> . 

In 2005, Paul introduced the [[We the People Act]], which would have removed from the jurisdiction of federal courts "any claim based upon the right of privacy, including any such claim related to any issue of sexual practices, orientation, or reproduction" and "any claim based upon equal protection of the laws to the extent such claim is based upon the right to marry without regard to sex or sexual orientation."<ref name="wtpa"/> If made law, these provisions would remove sexual practices, and particularly [[same-sex union]]s, from federal jurisdiction.  . 

In February 2011, [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Eric Holder]] announced that the Obama administration's [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] had determined that a key provision of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] was unconstitutional and, as a result, the administration would no longer argue in support of the act's constitutionality in court. <ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. Won't Defend Man-Woman Marriage Law|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2011/02/23/US-wont-defend-man-woman-marriage-law/UPI-35481298493231|accessdate=26 January 2012|newspaper=UPI.com|date=2011-02-23}}</ref> Paul issued a statement to Iowa Republicans criticizing the Obama administration's position, saying: "Like the majority of Iowans, I believe that marriage is between one man and one woman and must be protected. I supported the Defense of Marriage Act, which used Congress’ constitutional authority to define what other states have to recognize under the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]], to ensure that no state would be forced to recognize a same sex marriage license issued in another state."<ref>{{cite news|title=Ron Paul Condemns Obama's Decision to Abandon DOMA|url=http://theiowarepublican.com/2011/ron-paul-condemns-obama%E2%80%99s-decision-to-abandon-doma/|accessdate=26 January 2012|newspaper=The Iowa Republican|date=2011-02-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Vander Hart|first=Shane|title=Ron Paul Condemns Obama's Decision to Abandon DOMA|url=http://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2011/02/ron-paul-condems-obamas-decision-to-abandon-doma/|accessdate=26 January 2012|newspaper=Caffeinated Thoughts|date=2011-02-24}}</ref> . 

===Don't Ask, Don't Tell===. 
In the third Republican debate on June 5, 2007, Paul said about the [[Military of the United States|U.S. military's]] "[[don't ask, don't tell]]" policy:
{{Quote|I think the current policy is a decent policy. And the problem that we have with dealing with this subject is we see people as groups, as they belong to certain groups and that they derive their rights as belonging to groups. We don't get our rights because we're gays or women or minorities. We get our rights from our Creator as individuals. So every individual should be treated the same way. So if there is homosexual behavior in the military that is disruptive, it should be dealt with. But if there's heterosexual behavior that is disruptive, it should be dealt with. So it isn't the issue of homosexuality. It's the concept and the understanding of individual rights. If we understood that, we would not be dealing with this very important problem. <ref name="nhdebate"/>}}
Paul elaborated his position in a 65-minute interview at Google, stating that he would not discharge openly gay troops if their behavior was not disruptive. <ref name="atgoogle"/> . 

Ultimately, Paul voted in the affirmative for HR 5136, an amendment that leads to a full repeal of "[[don't ask, don't tell]]", on May 27, 2010. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2010/roll317.xml |title=Final Vote Results for Roll Call 317|publisher=U.S. House of Representatives|date=2010-05-27|accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref> He subsequently voted for the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]] on December 18, 2010.  . 

===Sodomy laws===. 
Paul has been a critic of the Supreme Court's  ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' decision, in which [[sodomy laws]] were ruled unconstitutional under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. In an essay posted to the [[Lew Rockwell]] website, he stated his opposition to what he called ridiculous sodomy laws, but expressed his fear that federal courts were grossly violating their role of strictly interpreting the Constitution, and felt that they were setting a dangerous precedent of what he characterized as legislating from the bench, by declaring privacy in regards to sexual conduct a constitutional right. Ron Paul said:
{{Quote|Consider the Lawrence case decided by the Supreme Court in June. The Court determined that Texas had no right to establish its own standards for private sexual conduct, because gay sodomy is somehow protected under the 14th amendment "right to privacy". Ridiculous as sodomy laws may be, there clearly is no right to privacy nor sodomy found anywhere in the Constitution. There are, however, states' rights – rights plainly affirmed in the Ninth and Tenth amendments. Under those amendments, the State of Texas has the right to decide for itself how to regulate social matters like sex, using its own local standards. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul120.html|title=Federal Courts and the Imaginary Constitution|author=Paul, Ron|publisher=[[Lew Rockwell]]|date=2003-08-12|accessdate=2007-12-11}}</ref>}} . 

==States' powers==. 
Paul's positions on civil liberties are often based on [[states' rights]], certain [[right]]s and [[political power]]s that [[U.S. state]]s possess in relation to the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]].

Paul refers to his background as an [[obstetrician]] as being influential on his view, recalling inadvertently witnessing a late-term abortion performed by one of his instructors during his residency, "It was pretty dramatic for me to see a two-and-a-half-pound baby taken out crying and breathing and put in a bucket."<ref>Caldwell, Christopher. [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/magazine/22Paul-t.html Profile of Ron Paul], ''The New York Times''</ref> During a May 15, 2007, appearance on the [[Fox News]] talk show ''[[Hannity and Colmes]]'', Paul argued that his pro-life position was consistent with his libertarian values, asking, "If you can't protect life then how can you protect liberty?" Furthermore, Paul argued in this appearance that since he believes libertarians support non-aggression, libertarians should oppose abortion because abortion is "an act of aggression" against a fetus, which is alive, human, and he believes possesses legal rights. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/vance/vance133.html|title=Is Ron Paul Wrong on Abortion?|author=Vance, Laurence M.|date=2008-01-29|accessdate=2008-02-11|publisher=[[Lew Rockwell]]}}</ref> . 

Paul has said that the [[9th Amendment to the United States Constitution|ninth]] and [[10th Amendment to the United States Constitution|tenth amendments]] to the [[U.S. Constitution]] do not grant the federal government any authority to legalize or ban [[abortion]], stating that "the federal government has no authority whatsoever to involve itself in the abortion issue."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul301.html|title=Federalizing Social Policy|publisher=Lew Rockwell|accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref> However, this has not stopped Paul from voting in favor of a federal ban on partial-birth abortion in 2000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2000/roll104.xml |title=Final Vote Results for Roll Call 530|publisher=U.S. House of Representatives|date=2000-04-05|accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref> and 2003. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2003/roll530.xml |title=Final Vote Results for Roll Call 530|publisher=U.S. House of Representatives|date=2003-10-02|accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref> . 

In addition to defining human life to begin at [[Conception (biology)|conception]] at the Federal level, Paul's [[Sanctity of Life Act]] would remove challenges to prohibitions on abortion from federal court jurisdiction. <ref name="Govtrack.us"/> In 2005, Paul also introduced the [[We the People Act]], which would have removed "any claim based upon the right of privacy, including any such claim related to any issue of ... reproduction" from the jurisdiction of federal courts.

In order to "offset the effects of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''", Paul voted in favor of the federal [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] of 2003. He has described partial birth abortion as a "barbaric procedure". He also introduced H.R. 4379 that would prohibit the Supreme Court from ruling on issues relating to abortion, [[birth control]], the definition of marriage and [[homosexuality]] and would cause the court's precedents in these areas to no longer be binding. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:H.R.4379:|title=H.R. 4379|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref> He once said, "The best solution, of course, is not now available to us.

However, legislation which Paul has repeatedly introduced into Congress [see the [[We_the_people_act#We_the_People_Act|We The People Act]]] has been criticized for potentially freeing states to ban the prescription or use of contraception, by stripping the federal courts and the Supreme Court of the authority to rule on the constitutionality of such bans. <ref>{{cite news|last=Sheppard|first=Kate|title=Ron Paul vs. Birth Control|url=http://motherjones.com/politics/2012/02/ron-paul-birth-control|accessdate=24 February 2012|newspaper=Mother Jones|date=2012-02-14}}</ref> .

===Stem-cell research===. 
Paul supports [[stem-cell research]] generically, as evidenced by his authoring the [[Legislation sponsored by Ron Paul#Stem-cell research|Cures Can Be Found Act of 2007]] (H.R. 457; H.R. 3444 in 2005), a bill "to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide credits against income tax for qualified stem cell research, the storage of qualified stem cells, and the donation of umbilical cord blood". However, Paul believes the debate over the embryonic category of stem-cell research is another divisive issue over which the federal government has no jurisdiction.  .

Paul joined with conservative colleagues in voting "no" on HR 2560, the Democrats' version of a federal ban on human cloning. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=13311&can_id=296 |title=Project Vote Smart - Representative Ronald Paul on HR 2560 - Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2007 |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref>  The Bush White House had strongly opposed HR 2560, saying "The Administration is strongly opposed to any legislation that would prohibit human cloning for reproductive purposes but permit the creation of cloned embryos or development of human embryo farms for research, which would require the destruction of nascent human life."<ref>[http://www.nrlc.org/Killing_Embryos/SAPonHR2560.html "Statement of Administration Policy on HR 2560"].

===Capital punishment===. 
Paul stated in August 2007 that at the state level "[[Capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment]] is a deserving penalty for those who commit crime", but he does not believe that the federal government should use it as a penalty. <ref>[http://theamericanview.com/index.php?id=898&PHPSESSID=5fcc4750ffc284dbf49756d2142c7cf6 118: Exclusive Interview: Ron Paul On God/Government; Abortion; Homosexuality; And Much More] 12:35</ref> .

Although Paul supports the right of state and local school districts, under the [[10th Amendment]] of the Constitution, to implement [[school voucher|education voucher]] plans, he rejects federal government-controlled school voucher plans, preferring federal education tax credits instead. He regards federal voucher programs as a form of "taxpayer-funded welfare" in which money is taken from middle-class families to unfairly provide private-school educations to a particular group of children favored by politicians and bureaucrats. <ref name=educationbills /> He also worries that with federal school vouchers inevitably come further central government regulation and loss of local control over education. Private, religious schools, for instance, would feel pressured to conform to government dictates in order to become accredited by the Department of Education to qualify for participation in the voucher program. He points to how the federal government has used the threat of cutting off funding to dictate to universities which policies they must accept; he argues that the government would try to do the same with private schools. <ref name=educationbills /> . 

;College and Other Higher-Education . 

Paul asserts that access to “education is not a right.” He opposes all federal government scholarships and government loans for higher education, but is supportive of the offering of financial aid by private organizations. <ref name=Rupani>{{cite news|last=Rupani|first=Meena|title=interview cited in: Rep.

In a March 2, 2011 interview, when asked whether the government should provide financial aid to a poor student with good grades who wants to further his education, Paul responded that no, the government should not because “nobody has a right to someone else's wealth. You have a right to your life and you have a right to your property but you don't have a – education isn't a right. Medical care isn't a right. These are things you have to earn." (He went on to explain that there were no government loans when he went to school, yet education costs were much lower and he was able to finance his medical school education by obtaining private loans through the medical school.)<ref name=Rupani /> .

===Free-market environmentalism===. 
As a [[Free-market environmentalism|free-market environmentalist]], Paul sees [[Pollution|polluters]] as aggressors who should not be granted immunity from prosecution or otherwise insulated from accountability. Paul argues that enforcing private property rights through [[tort]] law would hold people and corporations accountable, and would increase the cost of polluting activities—thus decreasing pollution. <ref>[http://www.ronpaul2012.com/the-issues/energy/ The Issues – Energy] RonPaul2012.com</ref> He claims that environmental protection has failed due to lack of respect for private property: . 

{{Quote|The environment is better protected under private property rights ... We as property owners can't violate our neighbors' property. We can't pollute their air or their water.

He believes that environmental legislation, such as emissions standards, should be handled between the states or regions concerned.

Paul says he opposes government assistance to private businesses intended to help shape research and investment decisions, including to promote alternative energy production and use. During a June 2011 presidential primary campaign debate, Paul said, “There shouldn't be any assistance to private enterprise. It's not morally correct, it's not legal, it's bad economics. It's not part of the Constitution. If you allow an economy to thrive, they'll decide how R&D works or where they invest their monies.

However, in 2008 Paul urged the Department of Energy to approve a federal loan guarantee to help an energy company build two new nuclear reactors in South Texas. Asked to explain the apparent contradiction between his stated opposition to federal financial involvement in private-sector business decisions and his personal intervention in the case of the nuclear company, Paul's campaign issued a statement saying, “As a Congressman and as President, Dr. Paul will work to eliminate all federal intervention in the energy market. However, until that happens, he will do his best to ensure that the money Congress appropriates is spent in the best way possible.”<ref name=WPoilsubsidies /> .

Paul says that he opposes and votes against subsidies for oil and gas companies.

Paul says that when he entered medical practice in the early 1960s, before the Medicare and Medicaid programs were established, the poor and the elderly were hospitalized at about the same rates as they have been under Medicare and Medicaid in the 2000s, and that they received good care. He says further that in those days, doctors and hospitals provided cut-rate or free care to people who did not have health insurance – “every physician understood that he or she had a responsibility toward the less fortunate, and free medical care for the poor was the norm” – and that this was possible because healthcare costs were much lower. At a church charity hospital where he worked in his early years of practice, “nobody was turned away” for lack of ability to pay. <ref name=RPNashua1028/><ref name=RPManifeston/><ref name=RPLibertyDefined/> . 

Paul claims that government meddling in health care delivery is to blame for healthcare costs having skyrocketed over the past few decades. He recalls that in the early 1960s, patients typically paid for basic medical services with cash, as there was almost no government payment for care, and as those Americans who had private insurance were typically only covered for hospitalization and emergency care. <ref name=RPLibertyDefined/><ref name=RPManifeston/>
In that setting, he says, providers almost always charged minimal fees for services in order to improve the chance of being paid. He argues that the emergence of government as a payer for healthcare services in the form of Medicare and Medicaid, along with government policies of the 1970s that led to the expansion of private insurance to cover routine medical services in addition to hospitalization and emergency care, and which required most employers to provide health insurance for their employees, interfered with the traditional physician-patient relationship. The incentive for healthcare providers and patients to keep costs as low as possible was lost. He says that now providers always charge the maximal fees for services, since the government or insurance company can be counted on to pay the bills. <ref name=RPNashua1028/> . 

Paul additionally argues that government contributes to rising healthcare costs through yet other ways, such as through government regulations, one example being restrictions imposed by the Food and Drug Administration on the manufacture and sale of medications and dietary supplements, and through licensing of physicians and other healthcare practitioners, which Paul says interferes with market-based competition for healthcare services. He also criticizes the legal system's approach to the handling of medical malpractice claims, which he says needlessly inflates the cost of healthcare further still. <ref name=RPNashua1028/><ref name=RPLibertyDefined/><ref name=RPManifeston/><ref name=reimpt>{{cite journal|last=Paul|first=Ron|title=Reimportation of FDA-Approved Pharmaceuticals|journal=Congressional Record|date=2001-07-17|volume=147|issue=99|pages=E1345}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Paul|first=Ron|title=Introducing Health Freedom Legislation|journal=Congressional Journal|date=2011-05-27|volume=157|issue=75|pages=E972|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-05-27/html/CREC-2011-05-27-pt1-PgE972-2.htm|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref> . 

===Medical research funding===. 
Paul has long opposed government funding of medical research. Although he considers himself “pro-research,”<ref>{{cite journal|last=Paul|first=Ron|title=Considering the human cloning prohibition act of 2001|journal=Congressional Record, 107th Congress|date=2001-07-31|volume=147|issue=109|pages=H4926|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-07-31/html/CREC-2001-07-31-pt1-PgH4916-2.htm}}</ref> he believes that “all research in a free society should be done privately.” . 

In the mid-1980s, when no effective medication was yet available for AIDS treatment, Paul spoke publicly against all federal funding for AIDS research. <ref>{{cite news|last=Hammer|first=Mike|title=Libertarian Hopeful Eyes 1988 Presidential Race|newspaper=Daily Oklahoman|date=1987-06-06}}</ref> He also wrote, in his book ''Freedom Under Siege'', published in 1987, “Victims of the disease AIDS argue ... for crash research programs (to be paid for by people who don't have AIDS), demanding a cure.... The individual suffering from AIDS certainly is a victim – frequently a victim of his own lifestyle – but this same individual victimizes innocent citizens by forcing them to pay for his care. Crash research programs are hardly something, I believe, the Founding Fathers intended when they talked about equal rights.”<ref>{{cite book|last=Paul|first=Ron|title=Freedom Under Siege|year=1987|publisher=Foundation for Rational Economics|pages=22-23}}</ref>   . 

More recently, Paul has called federal funding for medical research unconstitutional and has complained that “neither party in Washington can fathom that millions and millions of Americans simply don’t want their tax dollars spent on government research of any kind....”<ref name=TSTMTP>{{cite news|last=Paul|first=Ron|title=Missing the Point: Federal Funding of Stem Cell Research|url=http://paul.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1193&Itemid=69|accessdate=18 February 2012|newspaper=Texas Straight Talk|date=2005-05-30}}</ref>  . 

He argues that the availability of federal research funds distorts “the natural market for scientific research” by inducing scientists to eschew pursuit of radical lines of potentially-promising research that might not appeal to politicians and bureaucrats who hold influence over the allocation of grant monies. “Federal funding of medical research guarantees the politicization of decisions about what types of research for what diseases will be funded. Scarce tax resources are allocated according to who has the most effective lobby, rather than on the basis of need or even likely success.

In 2003, Paul went against the majority of Republicans and voted to block implementation of the [[Medicare Part D]] program, which expanded Medicare to cover the costs of medications for the elderly and disabled, and which prohibited the government from negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies to try to get lower prices for the covered medications. <ref>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1: Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h108-1|work=108th Congress, 2003-11-22|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Ron Paul Says when Republicans were in Power, They Expanded Government Role in Health Care|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/25/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-when-republicans-were-power-they-exp/|accessdate=7 February 2012|newspaper=Politifact.com|date=2011-07-16}}</ref> In 2007, he again went against the majority of House Republicans when he voted with all of the Democrats in support of the [[Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007|Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act]], which, if enacted, would have given the government the authority to negotiate Medicare Part D drug prices with the manufacturers. <ref>{{cite web|title=House Vote #4: Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/vote.xpd?vote=h2007-23|work=110th Congress, 2007-01-12|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref> During the 2012 presidential primary campaign, Paul said that although he remains opposed to Medicare Part D, repealing it was not one of his immediate priorities. <ref name=CNNTeapot>{{cite news|title=CNN-Tea Party Republican Debate|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1109/12/se.03.html|accessdate=7 February 2012|newspaper=CNN|date=2011-09-12}}</ref> . 

===Tax credits for healthcare expenses & Children's Health Insurance Program===. 
Paul voted in 2007 and 2009 against reauthorization and expansion of the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program|Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP), which is a joint state-federal program to provide health insurance for children and pregnant women in low-income families who do not qualify for Medicaid. <ref>{{cite web|title=House Vote #1009, H.R. 3963: Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/vote.xpd?vote=h2007-1009|work=110th Congress, 2007-10-25|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=House Vote #982, Veto Override, H.R. 976: Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/vote.xpd?vote=h2007-982|work=110th Congress, 2007-10-18|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=House Vote #906, Agree to Senate Amendments with Amendments: H.R. 976 Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/vote.xpd?vote=h2007-906|work=110th Congress, 2007-09-25|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=House Vote #50, On Motion to Concur in the Senate Amendment: H.R. 2 Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/vote.xpd?vote=h2009-50|work=111th Congress, 2009-02-04|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=House Vote #16 On Passage: H.R. 2: Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/vote.xpd?vote=h2009-16|work=111th Congress, 2009-01-14|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref> . 

He has been a consistent advocate for offering tax credits for healthcare expenses. In each Congress since 2000 Paul has proposed bills that would provide families with tax credits of up to $500 for the healthcare expenses of each dependent family member, and up to $3000 for the care of each dependent with a disability or serious disease such as cancer. <ref>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4799: Family Health Tax Cut Act|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h106-4799|work=106th Congress, 2000.06.29|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1496: Child Health Care Affordability Act|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-1496|work=111th Congress, 2009-03-12|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref> . 

Since 2003, Paul has several times introduced into Congress proposals to provide tax credits for the cost of health insurance premiums, and to increase the allowable tax deduction for healthcare expenses (by removing the 7.5% deduction limit). He has also advocated expanding the tax benefits of health savings accounts. <ref>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1495: Comprehensive Health Care Reform Act of 2009|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-1495|work=111th Congress, 2009-03-12|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1287: Comprehensive Health Care Reform Act of 2003|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h108-1287|work=108th Congress, 2003-03-13|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Paul|first=Ron|title=Put Patients and Doctors Back in Control of Healthcare|journal=Texas Straight Talk|date=2010-05-31|url=http://paul.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1610&Itemid=69|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref> . 

===Discrimination based on genetic predisposition to disease===. 
Paul was the only member of the entire Congress to vote against the [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]] in 2008, which prohibits health insurers and employers from discriminating against an individual on the basis of carrying a gene(s) that is associated with an increased risk for developing a disease. <ref>{{cite web|title=House Vote #234: On Motion to Agree to the Senate Amendment: HR 493 Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/vote.xpd?vote=h2008-234|work=110th Congress, 2008-05-01|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref> His alternative proposal, offered in 2006, would have prohibited genetic-information-based discrimination by federal, state, and local governments or government contractors, but would also have allowed such discrimination by health insurers and other employers. <ref>{{cite web|title=H.R. 6125: Taxpayer Protection from Genetic Discrimination Act of 2006|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-6125|work=109th Congress, 2006-09-20|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref> . 

===Emergency medical care===. 
Paul opposes [[emergency medical treatment and active labor act|the federal law]] that requires physicians to treat all patients who go to emergency rooms seeking medical care regardless of the patient's ability to pay. He asserts that the law is unconstitutional: "The professional skills with which one earns a living are property. Therefore, the clear language of the Takings Clause of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] prevents Congress from mandating that physicians and hospitals bear the entire costs of providing health care to any group."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Paul|first=Ron|title=Introduction of Treat Physicians Fairly Act|journal=Congressional Journal|date=2007-08-02|volume=153|issue=127|pages=E1727}}</ref> He has proposed measures that, if enacted, would shift the burden of paying for such care to the government, by providing physicians with tax credits for 100% of the cost of uncompensated care they provide under such laws, and hospitals with a 100% deduction. <ref>{{cite web|title=H.R. 3344: Treat Physicians Fairly Act of 2007|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-3344|work=110th Congress, 2007-08-02|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1497: Treat Physicians Fairly Act of 2009|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-1497|work=111th Congress, 2009-03-12|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref> . 

===Insurance coverage of pre-existing medical conditions===. 
Paul opposes laws that require health insurance to cover pre-existing conditions. He argues that “once insurance companies are required by government to insure against preconditions, it's no longer insurance – it's a social welfare mandate and will result in bankrupting the insurance companies, or they will be bailed out by a government subsidy, further bankrupting the government. So far no one has mandated insurance companies sell fire insurance to a person whose house is on fire.”<ref name=RPLibertyDefined/> . 

During a primary debate in the 2012 presidential election campaign, Paul was asked who would pay for the medical care of a previously-healthy 30-year-old man without medical insurance who suddenly falls seriously ill and requires six months of intensive medical care. <ref name=CNNTeapot/> Paul said that "what he should do is whatever he wants to do, and assume responsibility for himself." When asked specifically whether the man should just be left to die, Paul then replied that he should not be left to die, but should be able to rely on the kindness of neighbors, friends, churches, and charities, as would have occurred back when Paul worked in a church charity hospital early in his career, at a time when healthcare paid for by the government was not available.  . 

Following the debate, Paul was criticized by some political commentators for his refusal to yield in his opposition to the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|2010 health insurance reform law]] ("Obamacare"), which prohibits insurers from denying coverage on the basis of a pre-existing condition, when it was pointed out that Paul's 2008 presidential campaign chair and friend had contracted a sudden severe illness necessitating a prolonged hospital stay before dying. He had not had any medical insurance through his employer and had been unable to purchase insurance due to a pre-existing condition. Although he had been able to receive medical care he required over the course of his illness, when he died the bills for that care amounted to about $400,000. His friends, including Paul, were able to raise about $50,000, but that still left $350,000 to be passed to his estate — or left unpaid (and passed on to other consumers and taxpayers). <ref>{{cite news|last=Volack|first=Jason M.|title=For Ron Paul, Question about the Uninsured May Have Hit Close to Home|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/09/for-ron-paul-question-about-the-uninsured-may-have-hit-close-to-home/|accessdate=7 February 2012|date=2011-09-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Bookman|first=Jay|title=For Ron Paul, Health-Care Question Struck Close to Home|url=http://blogs.ajc.com/jay-bookman-blog/2011/09/15/for-ron-paul-health-care-question-struck-close-to-home/|accessdate=7 February 2012|newspaper=Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=2011-09-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Sarlin|first=Benjy|title=Ron Paul Says Aide Who Died with $400k Medical Bill Didn't Need Government Help|url=http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/09/ron-paul-says-aide-who-died-with-400k-medical-bill-didnt-need-government-help.php|accessdate=7 February 2012|newspaper=TalkingPointsMemo|date=2011-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Page|first=Clarence|title=Ron Paul's Harsh Definition of 'Freedom'|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-09-18/news/ct-oped-0918-page-20110918_1_ron-paul-health-insurance-tea-party|accessdate=7 February 2012|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=2011-09-18}}</ref> . 

===Medical malpractice law reform===. 
Paul has proposed radical changes in the way [[medical malpractice]] claims are handled. <ref name=RPLibertyDefined/> Under  bills he has introduced multiple times beginning in 2003, a patient planning pregnancy, surgery, or other major medical procedures or medical treatment would be able to buy “negative outcomes” insurance at very low cost. If the patient were to experience a negative outcome in association with the medical procedure or treatment, he or she would then seek compensation through binding [[arbitration]], rather than through a medical malpractice trial before a jury. Paul claims that “using insurance, private contracts, and binding arbitration to resolve medical disputes benefits patients, who receive full compensation in a timelier manner than under the current system,” as well as physicians and hospitals, since their litigation costs, and malpractice insurance premiums, would be markedly reduced. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Paul|first=Ron|title=Freedom from Unnecessary Litigation Act|journal=Congressional Record|date=2003-03-12|volume=149|issue=40|pages=E437-438}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1249: Freedom from Unnecessary Litigation Act|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h108-1249|work=108th Congress, 2003-03-12|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1498: Freedom from Unnecessary Litigation Act of 2009|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-1498|work=111th Congress, 2009-03-12|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref> . 

===Proposal to eliminate Medicare===. 
Paul proposes that all government funding of medical care be eliminated (with the exception, perhaps, of care for veterans). His Plan to Restore America budget proposal would begin a phase out of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] starting in  2013, when workers younger than 25 would be able to opt out of participating in the program. <ref name=RPBudget/> He says that during the transition period, the commitments for coverage under Medicare that have already been made to older workers could be honored by cutting other government spending, such as by closing all US military bases overseas and ceasing to engage in foreign military “adventurism.” . 

===Food and Drug Administration policy===. 
Paul proposes sharply reducing the government's regulation of medications and health supplements by reducing the role of, and ultimately eliminating, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). <ref name=RPRehm>{{cite news|title=Rep. Ron Paul Liberty Defined (interview by Diane Rehm)|accessdate=7 February 2012|newspaper=WAMU The Diane Rehm Show|date=2011-05-03}}</ref> In a 2011 interview, Paul said, "Well, the FDA just serves the drug companies, you know.... [and] they also prevent drugs from coming on the market [until] 10, 15 years later than other countries have it. So, yes, government just gets in the way on so many of those things."<ref name=RPRehm/> He favors allowing FDA-approved prescription drugs to be imported from foreign countries and sold at a lower cost than the same drugs otherwise sell for in the US<ref name=reimpt/> – thereby allowing international markets to set drug prices in the US market – a practice that has been prohibited by the FDA. In the interest, as he sees it, of fighting for greater freedom of choice for consumers, he has also introduced bills that would significantly reduce the government's ability to prevent manufacturers or sellers of dietary supplements and certain other health products from making what government regulators believe to be false or misleading claims about the health effects of the products. He essentially feels that consumers should be able to buy whatever health aids they want from whomever they want, without the need for guidance by the government. <ref>{{cite web|last=Paul|first=Ron|title=Statement Introducing Health Freedom Legislation|url=http://paul.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1872&Itemid=60|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref> . 

===Physician licensure===. 
Paul argues against the prevailing system of government licensure of physicians and other healthcare practitioners. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Paul|first=Ron|title=More Government Won't Help|journal=Congressional Record|date=2009-09-23|volume=155|issue=135|pages=H9873-9874|url=http://paul.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=53&Itemid=60|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref> In a 2007 interview, Paul accused the medical profession of choosing to maintain a strict licensing system that permits only a small number of individuals to practice in order to be able to charge much higher fees. <ref name=RPKnoy/> He insisted that with a truly competitive marketplace for health services, a patient with a sore throat, for instance, would be able to be seen by a nurse more rapidly than by a medical doctor and treated by the nurse for only a fraction of the cost of what a medical doctor would charge. "Patients can sort this out. I mean, they're not going to go to the nurse if they need brain surgery. They can go there for a sore throat."<ref name=RPKnoy/> He believes that patients would be best served by healthcare practitioners operating under the rules of the free market in voluntary contractual arrangements. Paul feels that anyone who claims to be a healthcare practitioner (whether of allopathic, homeopathic, or naturopathic medicine) should be able to offer healthcare services, without interference from the “nanny state.”<ref name=RPLibertyDefined/> . 

===Marijuana===. 
Paul favors the right to use marijuana as a medical option. He was cosponsor of H.R. 2592, the States' Rights to [[Medical Marijuana]] Act. <ref>[http://cannabisnews.com/news/13/thread13529.shtml "Medical Marijuana Takes Center Stage On The Hill"] at Cannabis News, accessed on 19 August 2007</ref> He is currently a supporter of the [[Personal Use of Marijuana by Responsible Adults Act of 2008]]. He also believes [[marijuana]] should be completely legal at the federal level.{{cn|date=March 2012}} . 

===Drug prohibition===. 
Paul contends that [[prohibition (drugs)|prohibition]] of drugs is ineffective and advocates ending the [[War on Drugs]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst2004/tst051704.htm|title=The War on Drugs is a War on Doctors|author=Paul, Ron|publisher=[[U.S. House of Representatives]]|date=2004-04-17|accessdate=2008-03-08|work=[[Congressional Record]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080301111938/http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst2004/tst051704.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2001/10/30/war-on-terror-as-bad-as-war-on-drugs/|title=War on Terror As Bad As War on Drugs|author=Paul, Ron|work=Counterpunch|date=2001-10-30|accessdate=2011-12-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst2004/tst041904.htm|title=The Federal War on Pain Relief|author=Paul, Ron|publisher=[[U.S. House of Representatives]]|date=2004-04-19|accessdate=2008-03-08|work=[[Congressional Record]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080301113508/http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst2004/tst041904.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-03-01}}</ref> "Prohibition doesn't work. Prohibition causes crime." He believes that drug abuse should be treated as a medical problem: "We treat alcoholism now as a medical problem and I, as a physician, think we should treat drug addiction as a medical problem and not as a crime." The [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]] does not [[9th Amendment to the United States Constitution|enumerate]] or [[10th Amendment to the United States Constitution|delegate]] to Congress the authority to ban or regulate drugs in general.  . 

Paul believes in personal responsibility, but also sees inequity in the current application of drug enforcement laws, noting in 2000, "Many prisoners are non-violent and should be treated as patients with addictions, not as criminals. Irrational mandatory minimal sentences have caused a great deal of harm. We have non-violent drug offenders doing life sentences, and there is no room to incarcerate the rapists and murderers."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2000/cr020200.htm|title=A Republic, If You Can Keep It|date=2000-02-02|accessdate=2008-02-11|author=Paul, Ron|publisher=[[U.S. House of Representatives]]|work=[[Congressional Record]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080202084638/http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2000/cr020200.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-02-02}}</ref> . 

When asked about his position on implementing the [[10th Amendment to the United States Constitution|tenth amendment]], Paul explained, "Certain medical procedures and medical choices, I would allow the states to determine that. The state law should prevail not the Federal Government." Speaking specifically about [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] raids on [[medical marijuana]] clinics Paul said, "They're unconstitutional", and went on to advocate [[states' rights]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst2003/tst052603.htm|title=The Federal Government Bully in State and Local Elections|publisher=[[U.S. House of Representatives]]|author=Paul, Ron|date=2003-05-26|accessdate=2008-03-08|work=[[Congressional Record]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080301112717/http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst2003/tst052603.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-03-01}}</ref> and personal choice: "You're not being [[compassionate conservatism|compassionate]] by taking medical marijuana from someone who's suffering from cancer or AIDS ... People should have freedom of choice. We certainly should respect the law and the law says that states should be able to determine this." . 

===Veterans' hospital access===. 
Paul believes that the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] should not be building more hospitals, and that VA hospitals should instead be phased out. He believes that government should pay to treat veterans in private hospitals, arguing they will get better care more cost-effectively. <ref>Paul, Ron (2002-11-11) [http://www.antiwar.com/paul/paul52.html "Honoring Our Military Veterans"], Anti-war.com. Retrieved 2010-05-18. </ref> . 

===Government non-intervention in medical field===. 
Paul has also stated that "The government shouldn't be in the medical business." He also thinks that the talk about [[Swine influenza|swine flu]] and getting vaccinated by the Federal Government is being blown out of proportion. <ref>Malcolm, Andrew (2009-04-30) [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/04/ron-paul-swine-flu-federal-government.html "Ron Paul pooh-poohs swine flu; yet another grab for more Fed control!"], Los Angeles Times. </ref> . 

Paul, was asked a hypothetical question at a Tea Party debate by CNN host Wolf Blitzer about how society should respond if a healthy 30-year-old man who decided against buying health insurance suddenly requires intensive care for six months. Paul said it shouldn't be the government's responsibility. "That's what freedom is all about, taking your own risks," Paul said. Paul mentioned he does not believe society should let the aforementioned hypothetical man die but emphasized that churches and communities – rather than governments – should take care of those in need. <ref>Hartman, Rachel Rose (September 13, 2011).

==Election law==. 
===Ballot access===. 
As a former [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] candidate for President, Paul has been a proponent of [[ballot access]] law reform, and has spoken out on numerous election law reform issues.  . 

In 2003, he introduced H. R. 1941, the Voter Freedom Act of 2003, that would have created uniform ballot access laws for [[independent (politician)|independent]] and [[Third party (United States)|third political party]] candidates in Congressional elections. He supported this bill in a speech before Congress in 2004. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2004/cr071504.htm|title=End the Two-Party Monopoly!|publisher=House of Representatives|work=[[Congressional Record]]|date=2004-07-15|accessdate=2007-10-23|last=Paul|first=Ron |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930110358/http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2004/cr071504.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-30}}</ref> In 2007 he reintroduced a similar version of the bill.  . 

===Voting Rights Act===. 
In 2006, Paul joined 32 other members of Congress in opposing the renewal of the 1965 [[Voting Rights Act]], originally passed to remove barriers to voting participation for minorities. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.congress.org/congressorg/issues/votes/?votenum=374&chamber=H&congress=1092|title=Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act
|publisher=Congress.org|accessdate=2007-06-08}}</ref> Paul has indicated that he did not object to the voting rights clauses, but rather to restrictions placed on property rights by the bill. <ref name="votingrightsact">{{cite web|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul188.html|title=The Trouble With Forced Integration|accessdate=2007-07-11|author=Paul, Ron|date=2004-07-03|publisher=Lew Rockwell}}</ref> He felt the federal interference mandated by the bill was costly and unjustified because the situation for minorities voting is much different than when the bill was passed 40 years ago. Many of Texas' Republican representatives voted against the bill, because they believe it specifically singles out some Southern states, including Texas, for federal Justice Department oversight that makes it difficult for localities to change the location of a polling place or other small acts without first receiving permission from the federal government. <ref name="southernobjections">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/21/AR2006062101910.html|title=GOP Rebellion Stops Voting Rights Act|accessdate=2007-07-11|author=Babington, Charles |date=2006-06-22|work=The Washington Post}}</ref> The bill also mandated bilingual voting ballots upon request, which Paul objected to on the grounds that one of the requirements of gaining United States citizenship is ability to read in English, and that as it currently stands it often forces large expenditures to prepare materials that are in some cases never used. <ref name="kingletter">{{cite web|url=http://www.proenglish.org/issues/ballots/kingletter.pdf|format=PDF|title=King letter|accessdate=2007-07-11|date=2006-02-03|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927005428/http://www.proenglish.org/issues/ballots/kingletter.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}</ref> . 

===Civil Rights Act of 1964===. 
Paul opposes the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] on the grounds that it was an unconstitutional infringement on liberty and by leading to quotas has in his view increased racial disharmony. <ref name="votingrightsact"/> . 

===State representation===. 
Paul would like to restore State representation in Congress. During a speech in New Hampshire in February 2007 Paul called for a repeal of the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|seventeenth amendment]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Libertarian+candidate+in+%2788%2c+Paul+eyes+GOP+nomination&articleId=1ea4b86c-ef92-4a1c-9bff-1328cfbc16f2|title=Libertarian candidate in '88, Paul eyes GOP nomination|work=New Hampshire Union Leader|location=Manchester|first=Benjamin|last=Kepple|accessdate=2011-12-18|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070304082936/http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Libertarian+candidate+in+%2788%2c+Paul+eyes+GOP+nomination&articleId=1ea4b86c-ef92-4a1c-9bff-1328cfbc16f2|archivedate=2007-03-04}}</ref> which replaced state election of U.S. Senators with popular election. Instead Paul would have members of state legislatures vote for U.S. Senators as they had done under [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 3, Clause 1: Composition and selection|Article One, Section 3]]. Direct popular representation would be retained in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]. Paul believes that increased representation of state interests at the federal level encourages greater sharing of power between state and federal government. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://centre.telemanage.ca/links.nsf/articles/E381FC8AD15A01BB852569020076F31E|title=Public letter by Congressman Ron Paul on the World Trade Organization|accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref> . 

===Electoral college===. 
In 2004, he spoke out against efforts to abolish the [[United States Electoral College|electoral college]], stating that "Democracy, we are told, is always good. But the founders created a constitutionally limited republic precisely to protect fundamental liberties from the whims of the masses, to guard against the excesses of democracy. The electoral college likewise was created in the Constitution to guard against majority tyranny in federal elections. The President was to be elected by the states rather than the citizenry as a whole, with votes apportioned to states according to their representation in Congress."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst2004/tst122704.htm|title=Hands Off the Electoral College|publisher=House of Representatives|accessdate=2011-10-01|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070303213432/http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst2004/tst122704.htm|deadurl=yes|archivedate = 2007-03-03}}</ref> . 

==Foreign policy==. 
Paul's views are generally attributed to those of [[non-interventionism]], which is the belief that the United States should avoid entangling alliances with other nations, but still retain diplomacy, and avoid all wars not related to direct territorial self-defense.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Paul is quoted as stating "America [should] not interfere militarily, financially, or covertly in the internal affairs of other nations", while advocating "open trade, travel, communication, and diplomacy with other nations". <ref>[http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul375.html], [[Lew Rockwell|LewRockwell.com]] (2007-03-16)</ref>  [[Ronald Reagan]] spoke in support of Paul's foreign policy views in the early 1980s, stating "Ron Paul is one of the outstanding leaders fighting for a stronger national defense.

We need to keep him fighting for our country."<ref>[http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/02/when-ronald-reagan-endorsed-ron-paul/70913/], [[The Atlantic]] (2011-02-07)</ref>  [[Daniel Ellsberg]], famous for releasing the [[Pentagon Papers]], has said of Paul in 2010: "On foreign policy, on the Constitution, on Homeland Security, on intervention, he speaks very well."<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036677/ns/msnbc_tv-countdown_with_keith_olbermann/#40613791 Countdown with Keith Olbermann], [[MSNBC]] (2010-12-10)</ref> Ohio Democratic Congressman [[Dennis Kucinich]] has said that he and Paul "agree tremendously on international policy". <ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py8cXlLyX18 Dennis Kucinich asked about Ron Paul on Free Minds TV], ''[[YouTube]]'' (2007-12-15)</ref> . 

===Non-intervention===. 
Paul's stance on foreign policy is one of consistent [[United States non-interventionism|non-intervention]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst2002/tst091602.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020923122526/http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst2002/tst091602.htm|archivedate=2001-09-23|title=Entangling Alliances Distort our Foreign Policy|last=Paul|first=Ron|work=Texas Straight Talk|publisher=House of Representatives|date=2002-09-16}}</ref><ref name=patriotism>{{cite news|title=Patriotism|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul388.html|work=[[Congressional Record]]|publisher=House of Representatives|author=Paul, Ron|date=2007-05-22|accessdate=2007-10-23}}</ref> opposing [[wars of aggression]] and [[entangling alliances]] with other nations. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/foreign-policy-rp.html|title=The Foreign Policy of Ron Paul|author=Rockwell, Lew|publisher=Lew Rockwell|date=2007-05-21|accessdate=2007-11-06}}</ref> . 

Paul advocates bringing troops home from U.S. military bases in [[Korea]], [[Japan]], and [[Europe]], among others. <ref name=townhall2/> He also proposes that the U.S. stop sending what he deems massive, unaccountable [[foreign aid]]. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22342301/|title='Meet the Press' transcript for Dec. 23, 2007: Representative Ron Paul (R-TX), John Harwood and Chuck Todd|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|work=Meet the Press|author=Russert, Tim|date=2007-12-23|accessdate=2008-02-08}}</ref> The ''[[National Journal]]'' labeled Paul's overall foreign policies in 2010 as more conservative than 60% of the House and more [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] than 40% of the House (53% and 47%, respectively, in 2009). <ref name=aap2012 /> For 2008, his ratings were 57% more conservative and 42% more liberal (48% and 52%, respectively, in 2007). <ref name="AAP 2010">{{cite book |title=[[Almanac of American Politics]] 2010 |year=2009 |publisher=National Journal |page=1445}}</ref> . 

In an October 11, 2007 interview with ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Paul said, "There's nobody in this world that could possibly attack us today... we could defend this country with a few good submarines. If anybody dared touch us we could wipe any country off of the face of the earth within hours. And here we are, so intimidated and so insecure and we're acting like such bullies that we have to attack third-world nations that have no military and have no weapons."<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/11/AR2007101101555.html Ron Paul: Give Peace a Chance], The Washington Post, October 11, 2007</ref>
====Afghanistan====. 
Paul voted with the majority for the original [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]] in Afghanistan. <ref name="AUMF">{{cite web|title=Key Vote (How all members voted): Authorization for Use of Military Force|url=http://www.vote-smart.org/issue_keyvote_member.php?cs_id=V3064|publisher=[[Project Vote Smart]]|accessdate=2007-10-23|date=2005-02-03|archivedate=2007-11-04|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071104024813/http://www.vote-smart.org/issue_keyvote_member.php?cs_id=V3064}}</ref> considering that it was a response to the [[September 11 attacks]]. But over the years even though he initially supported the [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|War in Afghanistan]], Paul also advocates withdrawing troops from Afghanistan because he believes a decade of war in Afghanistan is enough.  . 

Paul also stated, . 

“There really is nothing for us to win in Afghanistan. Our mission has morphed from apprehending those who attacked us, to apprehending those who threaten or dislike us for invading their country, to remaking an entire political system and even a culture … This is an expensive, bloody, endless exercise in futility. Not everyone is willing to admit this just yet. But every second they spend in denial has real costs in lives and livelihoods … Many of us can agree on one thing, however. Our military spending in general has grown way out of control.” . 

====Iraq====. 
Paul was the only [[Republican Party (United States) presidential candidates, 2008|2008 Republican presidential candidate]] who voted against the [[Iraq Resolution|Iraq War Resolution]] in 2002,<ref name=war0902>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2002/cr090402.htm|title=Arguments Against a War in Iraq|accessdate=2007-10-23|date=2002-09-04|author=Paul, Ron|publisher=[[U.S. House of Representatives]]|work=[[Congressional Record]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930110713/http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2002/cr090402.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-30}}</ref><ref name=war1002>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2002/cr100802.htm|title=Statement Opposing the use of Military Force against Iraq|accessdate=2007-10-23|author=Paul, Ron|date=2002-10-08|publisher=[[U.S. House of Representatives]]|work=[[Congressional Record]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930111604/http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2002/cr100802.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-30}}</ref> and he opposed the U.S. presence in [[Iraq]], charging the government with using the [[War on Terror]] to curtail [[civil liberties]].

====Israel====. 
Paul argues that if the United States cares about Israel, the U.S. should allow them to be more independent.  He states that "the surrounding Arab nations get seven times as much aid as Israel gets and also a recent study came out that showed that for every dollar you give to an Arab nation it prompts Israel to spend 1.4 dollars."<ref name=MikeChurch20110617>{{Cite interview|title=''"Ron Paul Interviewed by Mike Church"''|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_be9XZ_4_c|date=2011-06-17|first=Ron|last=Paul|accessdate=2012-01-01|interviewer=[[Mike Church]]|program=''The Mike Church Show''|at=Occurs at 4:28–5:57}}</ref> Paul would not stop Israel from defending its interests in any way it saw fit. <ref name=MikeChurch20110617 /> . 

{{Quote|Our foreign military aid to Israel is actually more like corporate welfare to the U.S. military industrial complex, as Israel is forced to purchase only U.S. products with the assistance.

{{Quote|We have adopted a foreign policy that has left Israel surrounded by militaristic nations while undermining Israel's sovereignty by demanding that its foreign and defense policies be essentially pre-approved in Washington. That is a bad deal for Israel, as sovereign nations must determine on their own what is a most appropriate national defense. On foreign policy as well, the U.S. steps in to prevent Israel from engaging in dialogue with nations of which the U.S. administration disapproves. <ref name=JVLRP08 />}} . 

Paul was in Congress when Israel [[Operation Opera|bombed Iraq's Osirak nuclear plant]] in 1981 and—unlike the United Nations and the Reagan administration—defended its right to do so. He says Saudi Arabia has an influence on Washington equal to Israel's. He votes against support for Israel due to his opposition to foreign aid by the US in general. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/magazine/22Paul-t.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Christopher | last=Caldwell |authorlink=Christopher Caldwell | title=The Antiwar, Anti-Abortion, Anti-Drug-Enforcement- Administration, Anti-Medicare Candidacy of Dr. Ron Paul | date=2007-07-22}}</ref> . 

In an interview with Don Imus, Paul was asked for his view of the [[Gaza flotilla raid]]. He responded, "...I think it's absolutely wrong to prevent people that are starving and having problems, that are almost like in concentration camps, and saying yes we endorse this whole concept that we can't allow ships to go in there in a humanitarian way..."
Imus remarked, "They are allowing humanitarian aid in... what they're concerned about is weapons falling into the hands of Hamas..." Paul responded, "Well, they're an elected government, I mean Hamas; We have thousands of our soldiers dying to say that we want elections and we want democracy, so we finally get one in Palestine, and they elect Hamas, and then all of a sudden whoa you've elected the wrong people..."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF3w3fAOUWk|title=Ron Paul: U.S. Shouldn't Support Israel's Gaza Blockade|date=2010-06-03}}</ref> . 

At the ABC News Iowa Republican Debate, Paul was asked if he agreed with Newt Gingrich's "characterization, that the Palestinians are an invented people." Paul responded, "No, I don't agree with that. And that's just stirring up trouble. And I believe in a non-interventionist foreign policy. I don't think we should get in the middle of these squabbles. But to go out of our way and say that so-and-so is not a real people?

====Cuba====. 
Paul advocates ending the [[United States embargo against Cuba]], arguing, "Americans want the freedom to travel and trade with their Cuban neighbors, as they are free to travel and trade with Vietnam and China. Those Americans who do not wish to interact with a country whose model of governance they oppose are free to boycott. The point being – it is Americans who live in a free country, and as free people we should choose who to buy from or where to travel, not our government....

====The World Trade Organization====. 
Paul states that the WTO is a barrier to free trade and that the economic argument for free trade should be no more complex than the moral argument. {{Quote|Tariffs are taxes that penalize those who buy foreign goods. If taxes are low on imported goods, consumers benefit by being able to buy at the best price, thus saving money to buy additional goods and raise their standard of living.

He voted against the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA), holding that it increased the size of government, eroded U.S. sovereignty, and was unconstitutional. <ref name="cafta"/> He has also voted against the [[Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement|Australia–U.S. FTA]], the [[United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement|U.S.–Singapore FTA]], and the [[US-Chile Free Trade Agreement|U.S.–Chile FTA]], and voted to withdraw from the [[WTO]]. He believes that "fast track" powers, given by [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] to the [[President of the United States|President]] to devise and negotiate FTAs on the country's behalf, are unconstitutional, and that Congress, rather than the executive branch, should construct FTAs. <ref name="dobbs423"/> . 

Paul also has a 57% voting record in favor of free trade in the House of Representatives, according to the [[Cato Institute]]. <ref>(2011-08-19)  [http://www.cato.org/trade-immigration/congress/ "Free Trade, Free Markets: Rating the Congress"]. </ref> . 

===Borders and immigration===. 
Paul considers it a "[[Boondoggle (project)|boondoggle]]" for the U.S. to spend much money policing other countries' borders (such as the [[Iraq]]–[[Syria]] border) while leaving its own borders porous and unpatrolled;<ref name=crazed>{{cite news|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul137.html|title=Crazed Foreign Aid|first=Ron|last=Paul|publisher=[[U.S. House of Representatives]]|work=[[Congressional Record]]|date=2007-10-17|accessdate=2008-02-08}}</ref> he argues the U.S.–Mexico border can be crossed by anyone, including potential terrorists. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul269.html|title=Immigration and the Welfare State|first=Ron|last=Paul|date=2005-08-09|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref> During the [[Cold War]], he supported Reagan's [[Strategic Defense Initiative]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Ron_Paul.htm|title=Ron Paul On the Issues|publisher=On the Issues}}</ref> intended to replace the "strategic offense" doctrine of [[mutual assured destruction]] with strategic defense.  . 

Paul favors legal [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]] to the United States—today, approximately 1 million people per year—<ref>{{cite web|title=Yearbook of Immigration Statistics: 2010|publisher=U.S. Department of Homeland Security|url=http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/statistics/yearbook/2010/table01.xls}}</ref> and opposes illegal immigration. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.yahoo.com/top-republican-2012-presidential-hopefuls-immigration-221100104.html|title=Top Republican 2012 Presidential Hopefuls on Immigration|author=Sylvia Cochran|publisher=[[Yahoo!

Paul believes [[illegal immigration|illegal aliens]] take a toll on [[Social welfare provision|welfare]] and Social Security and would end such benefits, concerned that uncontrolled immigration makes the U.S. a magnet for illegal aliens, increases welfare payments, and exacerbates the strain on an already highly unbalanced federal budget. <ref name=immig>{{cite news|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul269.html|title=Immigration and the Welfare State|author=Paul, Ron|publisher=[[Lew Rockwell]]|date=2005-08-09|accessdate=2007-10-23}}</ref> . 

Paul believes that illegal immigrants should not be given an "unfair advantage" under law. <ref>[http://youtube.com/watch?v=C4c9S9meOng Ron Paul on Immigration]{{dead link|date=October 2011}} [[YouTube]]</ref> He has advocated for a "coherent immigration policy", and has spoken strongly against [[amnesty]] for illegal aliens because he believes it undermines the [[rule of law]], grants [[pardon]]s to lawbreakers,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul150.html|title=Ron Paul on Amnesty|accessdate=2007-04-02}}</ref> and [[subsidy|subsidizes]] more illegal immigration. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/2020/Stossel/story?id=3985423|title=Ron Paul Unplugged: Cutting Benefits for Illegal Immigrants: John Stossel Interviews Ron Paul on Amnesty, Immigration|author=[[John Stossel|Stossel, John]], and Binkley, Gena|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=2007-12-12|accessdate=2007-02-08}}</ref> Paul voted for the [[Secure Fence Act of 2006]], authorizing an additional 700 miles (1100 kilometers) of double-layered fencing between the U.S. and Mexico mainly because he wanted enforcement of the law and opposed amnesty, not because he supported the construction of a border fence. <ref name="Ron Paul on Immigration">{{cite news|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/01/ron_paul_on_immigration.html|title=Ron Paul on Immigration}}</ref> . 

Paul believes that [[Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act|mandated hospital emergency treatment for illegal aliens]] should be ceased and that assistance from charities should instead be sought because there should be no federal mandates on providing health care for illegal aliens. <ref name="Ron Paul on Immigration"/> . 

Paul also believes children born in the U.S. to illegal aliens should not be granted automatic [[jus soli (U.S.)|birthright citizenship]]. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul346.html|title=Ron Paul on Birth Right Citizenship}}</ref> He has called for a new Constitutional amendment to revise [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|fourteenth amendment]] principles and "end automatic birthright citizenship",<ref>{{cite web|title=Rethinking Birthright Citizenship|first=Ron|last=Paul|url=http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst2006/tst100206.htm|publisher=House of Representatives|work=Texas Straight Talk|date=2006-10-02|accessdate=2007-05-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070430013426/http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst2006/tst100206.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-04-30}}</ref> and believes that welfare issues are directly tied to the illegal immigration problem. <ref>[http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul269.html Immigration and the Welfare State] Lew Rockwell.com</ref> . 

===Terrorism===. 
====Letters of marque and reprisal====. 
Calling the [[September 11, 2001, attacks]] an act of "air piracy", Paul introduced the Marque and Reprisal Act of 2001. [[Letters of marque and reprisal]], authorized by [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|article I, section 8 of the Constitution]], would have targeted specific terrorist suspects instead of invoking war against a foreign state. <ref name="rppr01"/> Paul reintroduced this legislation as the Marque and Reprisal Act of 2007. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.03216:|title=Marque and Reprisal Act of 2007}}</ref> He voted with the majority for the original [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]] in Afghanistan. <ref name="AUMF"/> In April 2009, following the [[Maersk Alabama hijacking]], he proposed issuing letters of marque to combat the problem of [[piracy in Somalia]]. <ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jyG7EtPtRN_AdgusdTswFk5JDJuw "US lawmaker: Bring back private pirate hunters"], Associated Press, 2010-04-15</ref> . 

====Airport security====. 
Following the [[9/11 attacks]], Paul "opposed the [[Transportation Security Administration|federalization]] of airport security, the creation of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|DHS]] and increased police state measures, but did propose legislation that would allow airline pilots to begin carrying firearms in cockpits", on the theory that "it's much harder for terrorists to commandeer an airplane when pilots can fight back."<ref>Hunter, Jack (2011-01-14) [http://www.amconmag.com/blog/2011/01/14/second-amendment-remedies/ Second Amendment Remedies], ''[[The American Conservative]]''</ref> . 

====Investigation====. 
Paul supports reopening investigation into the attacks to discover why the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] did not act on 70 internal field tips: "We had one FBI agent, I think sent dozens and dozens of memos to his superiors saying that there are people trying to fly airplanes but not land them, and nobody would pay any attention."<ref name="gallagher">{{cite web|url=http://ronpaulaudio.com|title=Ron Paul Audio|work=Mike Gallagher Radio Show|date=2007-07-19}}</ref> He also advocates investigating why the various intelligence agencies could not collaborate on information to prevent the attacks while spending $40 billion per year. <ref name="gallagher"/><ref name="reason911">{{cite news|url=http://www.reason.com/blog/show/120338.html|title=Ron Paul on 9/11 and Eric Dondero|work=Reason|date=2007-05-22|accessdate=2007-10-08}}</ref> He has called the [[9/11 Commission Report]] a "charade", saying "spending more money abroad or restricting liberties at home will do nothing to deter terrorists, yet this is exactly what the 9-11 Commission recommends."<ref name="charade">{{cite news|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul200.html|title=The 9-11 Commission Charade|first=Ron|last=Paul}}</ref> . 

====Rejection of 9/11 conspiracy theory====. 
Paul does not believe the [[World Trade Center]] and [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] attacks were a [[Conspiracy (political)|government conspiracy]] and has explicitly denied being a [[9/11 truth movement|9/11 "truther"]], arguing that the issue is not a conspiracy but a failure of bureaucracy. <ref name="gallagher"/><ref name="reason911"/> He believes the [[9/11 Commission Report]]'s main goal was "to protect the government and to protect their ineptness—not […] to do this so they can use this as an excuse to spread the war […] Some who did want to spread the war would use it as an opportunity. But, it wasn't something that was deliberately done."<ref name="gallagher"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/representativepress2/RonPaul.html?attredirects=0|title=Ron Paul says 9/11 was ineptness and NOT "an Inside Job"|date=2007-10-04|accessdate=2007-10-08|last=Gill|first=Steve|work=Steve Gill}}</ref> He does not think the government would have staged such an attack. <ref>{{cite news|title=Fox News Interview|date=2007-08-05|publisher=Fox News Channel}}</ref> When asked whether "9/11 was orchestrated by the government", Paul responded, "Absolutely not."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=de1_1185477767|title=LiveLeak Exclusive: Interview with Ron Paul|last=Wasson|first=Shawn}}</ref> Paul has stated that he is concerned that someone might create a "contrived [[Gulf of Tonkin Incident|Gulf of Tonkin]]-type incident" to justify the invasion of Iran or suspend the democratic process, adding, "Let's hope I'm wrong about this one."<ref name=escalation/> . 

====Operation to kill Osama bin Laden====. 
In May 2011, Paul said he would not have ordered [[Death of Osama bin Laden|the raid that killed]] [[Osama bin Laden]], calling the operation "absolutely not necessary". <ref>{{cite news|author=AP |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/05/12/ron-paul-ordered-bin-laden-raid/ |title=Ron Paul: I Would Not Have Ordered Bin Laden Raid |publisher=Foxnews.com |date=2010-04-07 |accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref> Instead he would have done it differently, stating that America should have worked with the Pakistani Authorities who in the past had arrested [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] and other terrorists who were then tried in court. Paul also stated that other alternatives were viable that were less of a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} . 

====Operation to kill Anwar al-Awlaki====. 
On September 30, 2011, Paul said "If the American people accept this blindly and casually – have a precedent of an American president assassinating people who he thinks are bad. I think that's sad."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/09/ron-paul-on-awlaki-killing-sad-precedent |title=Ron Paul on Awlaki Killing: 'Sad' Precedent |publisher= ABC News |date=2011-09-30|first=Jason M.|last=Volack |accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref> .
