They told me over and over again that they want a Senator who comes back home. <ref>http://www.richardmourdock.com/news/state-treasurer-richard-mourdock-officially-announces-his-2012-us-senatorial-bid</ref>” He also released results from a poll conducted by Wilson Research Strategies on behalf of Mourdock.
