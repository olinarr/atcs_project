In [[United States]] politics, an '''earmark''' is a legislative (especially [[United States Congress|congressional]]) provision that directs approved funds to be spent on specific projects, or that directs specific exemptions from taxes or mandated fees. <ref>[http://earmarks.omb.gov/earmarks_definition.html Earmarks]. Earmarks.omb.gov (November 12, 2010). Retrieved November 16, 2010. </ref> The term "earmark" is used in this sense in several countries, such as the US and South Africa. <ref>http://www.treasury.gov.za/public%20comments/Discussion%20Paper%20Carbon%20Taxes%2081210.pdf</ref> . 

Earmarks come in two varieties: Hard earmarks, or "Hardmarks," found in legislation and Soft earmarks, or "Softmarks" found in the text of congressional committee reports. Hard earmarks are binding and have the effect of law; soft earmarks do not have the effect of law but by custom are acted upon as if they were binding. <ref>[http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/m012606.pdf Earmarks in Appropriation Acts: FY1994, FY1996, FY1998, FY2000, FY2002, FY2004, FY2005], January 26, 2006</ref> Typically, a legislator seeks to insert earmarks that direct a specified amount of money to a particular organization or project in their home state or district.  . 

==Definition==. 
Congressional earmarks are often loosely defined as guarantees of federal expenditures to particular recipients in appropriations-related documents.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The federal Office of Management and Budget defines earmarks as funds provided by Congress for projects or programs where the congressional direction (in bill or report language) circumvents Executive Branch merit-based or competitive allocation processes, or specifies the location or recipient, or otherwise curtails the ability of the Executive Branch to manage critical aspects of the funds allocation process.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} . 

Attempts have been made to define earmarks in ethics and budget reform legislation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} However, due to the controversial nature of earmarks and the effects these definitions would have on congressional power, none of these has been widely accepted.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} . 

Despite the lack of a consensus definition, the definition most widely used was developed by the [[Congressional Research Service]], the public policy research arm of the U.S. Congress: . 

<blockquote>
"Provisions associated with legislation (appropriations or general legislation) that specify certain congressional spending priorities or in revenue bills that apply to a very limited number of individuals or entities. Earmarks may appear in either the legislative text or report language (committee reports accompanying reported bills and joint explanatory statement accompanying a conference report)."<ref>[http://www.opencrs.com/rpts/RL33295_20060306.pdf Comparison of Selected Senate Earmark Reform Proposals<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
</blockquote> . 

In the [[United States]] legislative appropriations process, [[United States Congress|Congress]] is required, by the limits specified under [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 9: Limits on Congress|Article I, Section 9]] of the [[United States Constitution]], to pass legislation directing all appropriations of money drawn from the U.S. Treasury. This provides Congress with the power to earmark funds it appropriates to be spent on specific named projects. The earmarking process has become a regular part of the process of allocating funds within the Federal government.  . 

Earmarking differs from the broader appropriations process in which Congress grants a yearly lump sum of money to a Federal agency. These monies are allocated by the agency according to its legal authority and internal budgeting process. With an earmark, Congress directs a specified amount of money from an agency's budget to be spent on a particular project. In the past Members of the Congress did not have to identify themselves or the project; however, as a result of recent reforms in Congress, earmarks are associated with requesting members in conference reports and members must certify that they and their immediate families have no direct financial interest in the earmark.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} . 

Earmarks have often been treated as being synonymous with "[[pork barrel]]" legislation. <ref>''E.g.'', Diana Marrero, "[http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2008-03-22-earmarks_N.htm Alaska 1st, Ariz. last in pork spending]", ''USA Today'', March 22, 2008 ("pork-barrel spending, otherwise known as earmarks"). Retrieved November 4, 2009. </ref> Despite considerable overlap,<ref>''E.g'', Ronald D. Utt, "[http://www.heritage.org/research/budget/bg1266.cfm How Congressional Earmarks and Pork-Barrel Spending Undermine State and Local Decisionmaking]"; The Heritage Foundation, April 2, 1999 ("'pork' . . . often manifests itself as a specific line item, or 'earmark.'"). Retrieved November 4, 2009. </ref> the two are not the same: what constitutes an earmark is an objective determination, while what is "pork-barrel" spending is subjective. <ref>For one view, see Citizens Against Government Waste, [http://www.cagw.org/site/PageServer?pagename=reports_pigbook2006#criteria 2006 Pig Book Summary]. Retrieved November 4, 2009. </ref> One legislator's "pork" is another's vital project. <ref>Judy Sarasohn, "[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/16/AR2006081601488.html Putting the Pork in One Barrel]", ''The Washington Post'', August 17, 2006. </ref> . 

In March 2010, the House Appropriations Committee implemented rules to ban earmarks to for-profit corporations. According to the New York Times, approximately 1,000 such earmarks were authorized in the previous year, worth $1.7 billion. <ref>Eric Lichtblau, "[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/12/us/politics/12lobby.html New Earmark Rules Have Lobbyists Scrambling]", ''The New York Times'', March 11, 2010. </ref> . 

==Defense==. 
Scott Frisch and Sean Kelly point out that directing money to particular purposes is a core constitutional function of Congress. If Congress does not make a specific allocation, the task falls to the executive branch; there is no guarantee that the allocation made by executive agencies will be superior to Congress's. <ref>http://www.cheesefactoriesonthemoon.com</ref> Presidents and executive officials can use the allocation of spending to reward friends and punish enemies. <ref>Scott A. Frisch and Sean Q Kelly, "Cheese Factories on the Moon: Why Earmarks are Good for American Democracy" (Boulder, CO: Paradigm Publishers, 2010)ISBN 978-1-59451-731-0{{Page needed|date=November 2010}}</ref> The process of earmarking has been substantially reformed since the beginning of the 110th Congress. Members of Congress must post all their requests on their websites and they must sign a certification letter (then put online) indicating that neither they nor their spouse has financial interest in the earmark request. <ref>[http://appropriations.house.gov/pdf/EarmarkAnnouncement3-11-09.pdf ]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref> Many members have instituted an applications process that their constituents must undergo for earmark requests. <ref>[http://www.nationaljournal.com/njmagazine/st_20090314_4955.php Earmarks Are A Model, Not A Menace - Sunday, November 7, 2010].
