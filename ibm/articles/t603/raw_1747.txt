The '''Project On Government Oversight''' ('''POGO'''), founded in 1981, is an independent [[non-profit organization]] in the United States which investigates and seeks to expose corruption and other misconduct.  POGO assists [[whistleblower]]s and investigates [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agencies]], [[United States Congress|Congress]], and government contractors.   POGO is currently led by executive director Danielle Brian.  . 

==Scope and methods==. 
POGO’s range of investigations includes: [[Military budget of the United States|national defense]] and [[United States Department of Homeland Security|homeland security]]; abuse in [[Government procurement in the United States|government contracting]]; excessive secrecy that fails to consider the [[public interest]]; and mismanagement of [[natural resources]] by federal agencies. POGO uses [[investigative journalism]] techniques to shed light on the government's activities, including working with [[whistleblower]]s and anonymous sources and accessing information through the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA).  POGO’s Federal Contractor Misconduct Database<ref>[http://www.contractormisconduct.org Federal Contractor Misconduct Database]</ref> is often used by investigative journalists and others who are interested in contractor misconduct.  . 

Corporate whistleblowers and government insiders bring POGO many of its investigative topics. POGO informs the public of its findings, mainly through reports that contain extensive documentation and recommendations for how to solve the problems identified. Once a report has been released, more insiders usually approach POGO to provide further documentation and information.  . 

==History==. 
===Early history===. 
While working for the National Taxpayers Legal Fund, Dina Rasor led its investigation into the [[C-5A]] transport aircraft. In February 1981 Rasor started "Project on Military Procurement", as an arm of the Fund. <ref name="Rasor">Webbe, Stephen (January 14, 1982).

===Whistleblower award incident===. 
In the 1990s POGO investigated<!--expand a bit, please - received tips about?--> the [[Department of the Interior]] [[Mineral Management Service]]'s collection of oil royalties.  POGO and other plaintiffs sued the 14<!-- per this source, others say 15 --> largest oil and gas companies for defrauding the government by underpaying royalties owed for drilling on Federal lands, under the [[False Claims Act]]. <ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Justice Department joins suit alleging royalty fraud|date=March 2, 1998|publisher=[[PennWell Corporation]]|work=[[Oil & Gas Journal]] |url=http://www.ogj.com/index/article-display/21169/articles/oil-gas-journal/volume-96/issue-9/in-this-issue/drilling/us-justice-department-joins-suit-alleging-royalty-fraud.html |archivedate=2010-10-01 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5t9jcVIYy |accessdate=2010-10-01}}</ref>  
In 1998 POGO shared proceeds of the settlement of that lawsuit with two whistleblowers, federal employees, in the amount of $383,600 each for their assistance leading up to the lawsuit. This resulted in a preliminary investigation and report in 2000<ref>Thompson, Paul (July 20, 2000).

which alleged that POGO's payments were for influence on [[Department of the Interior]] actions and policies.  While calling the payments "a mistake", committee member U.S. Senator [[Jeff Bingaman]] disputed any claims of influence, citing the timeline of events. <ref>Bingaman, Jeff (U.S. Sen) (September 5, 2000).

In 2003 the United States Department of Justice, under George W.

On August 3, 2010, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the District Court judge’s jury instructions which had prevented POGO from defending itself in the civil suit. The Court struck down the DOJ’s position that POGO’s intent was not relevant – a position that had prevented POGO from using the word “whistleblower” in its defense.  Accordingly, the jury verdict was vacated by the Court. <ref>{{cite web| url=http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/201008/08-5182-1258669.pdf |title= Project on Government Oversight, Appellant |format=PDF |date=August 3, 2010|publisher=United States Court of Appeals|accessdate=August 3, 2010}}</ref> . 

===The Art of Anonymous Activism=== . 

In 2002 the watchdog groups POGO, [[Government Accountability Project]], and [[Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility]], co-published the book ''The Art of Anonymous Activism: Serving the Public while Surviving Public Service.''

POGO investigates military weapons to expose improper influence by some defense contractors on [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] decision making. For example, POGO has claimed that members of the [[United States Congress]] ardently support [[weapons systems]] built or maintained in their districts, regardless of effectiveness or even Pentagon requests for these weapons. POGO believes that this behavior leads to misspending on military weapons programs, placing tax dollars and [[defense (military)|national defense]] at risk. <ref>[http://www.pogo.org/investigations/national-security/ "National Security Investigations."] The Project On Government Oversight. </ref> . 

POGO has a history of investigating and actively opposing the production of weapons that it believes to be wasteful or inefficient.

POGO investigated the [[Department of the Interior]]'s [[Minerals Management Service]], which manages natural resources on the nation's [[outer continental shelf]].

POGO has pushed for stronger oversight of the financial bailout and stimulus package. <!-- already cited above--> In 2009, POGO helped uncover payments totaling approximately $1.2 billion dollars paid to at least 30 companies that had violated the law through the stimulus package. <ref>[http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2009/10/26/Suspect-contractors-got-stimulus-contracts/UPI-28971256565674 "Suspect Contractors Got Stimulus Contracts"].

Retrieved 2010-07-28. </ref> POGO also wrote letters to Congress calling for strong oversight of financial industry representatives that give the government advice on the bailout and stimulus packages, citing this as a potential conflict of interest that could lead to pro-industry policies that do not help the taxpayer. <ref>Eviatar, Daphne (May 19, 2009).

In 2009, POGO sent a letter to Congress criticizing the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] for failing to implement more than half of the recommendations made to it by its Inspector General<ref>Johnson, Fawn. (December 17, 2009) [http://www.nasdaq.com/aspx/stock-market-news-story.aspx?storyid=200912171553dowjonesdjonline000580&title=group-alleges-slack-sec-response-to-internal-watchdog "Group Alleges Slack SEC Response to Internal Watchdog"]. [NASDAQ]. </ref> According to POGO, in the past 2 years, the SEC had taken no action on 27 out of 52 recommended reforms suggested in Inspector General reports, and still had a "pending" status on 197 of the 312 recommendations made in audit reports. Some of these recommendations included imposing disciplinary action on SEC employees who receive improper gifts or other favors from financial companies and investigating and reporting the causes of the failures to detect the Madoff ponzi scheme. <ref>Brian, Danielle.

POGO made several recommendations that were ultimately included in the [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], including promoting stronger whistleblower protections and rewards for financial industry employees, giving the Government Accountability Office the power to audit the [[Federal Reserve]], creating a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and giving [[Inspector Generals]] more independence. <ref>[http://www.pogo.org/pogo-files/alerts/financial-oversight/fo-fra-20100715.html "POGO Recommended Transparency and Accountability Measures in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act."] Project On Government Oversight.
