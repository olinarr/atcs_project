'''Childfree''' (sometimes spelled '''child-free''') also known as '''voluntary childlessness'''<ref>{{cite book|last=Chauncey|first=Laurie|title=Voluntary Childlessness in the United States: Recent Trends by Cohort and Period|year=2006|publisher=Louisiana State University|url=http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04032006-173356/unrestricted/Chancey_Thesis.pdf|accessdate=17 October 2011|format=Thesis}}</ref>  is a form of [[childlessness]]. The term was coined in the English language late in the 20th century<ref>The term does not appear, for example, in the 1971 edition of the ''Oxford English Dictionary''{{cite book| title=Oxford English Dictionary | publisher=Oxford University Press|date=1971|pages=343| unused_data=Library of Congress Catalogue Card Number= 76-188038}}</ref> and is used to describe people who have made a personal decision not to have [[child|children]].  The term childfree also describes domestic and urban environments in which children are not welcome. In this sense, the term is the opposite of child-friendly, which describes environments that are safe and welcoming for children. <ref> Following the historical research of P. Aries [''Centuries of Childhood'' London: Cape, 1962 ISBN 0-14-081101-X ] sociologists argue that the child as a social role and childhood as a social category separate from adults began to develop in the eighteenth century among the nobility. … Before this period, children were more thoroughly integrated into the world of adults.” Abercrombie, Nicholas, Stephen Hill and Bryan S. Turner,''The Penguin Dictionary of Sociology'' (Fourth Edition) London, p. 46 ISBN 0-14-051380-9</ref> The meaning of the term childfree extends to encompass the children of others (in addition to one’s own children) and this distinguishes it further from the more usual term "childless", which is traditionally used to express the idea of having no children, whether by choice or by circumstance. <ref> The obsolete term “childerless”, meaning “without children” is given, for example in {{cite book| title=Oxford English Dictionary | publisher=Oxford University Press|date=1971|pages=343| unused_data=Library of Congress Catalogue Card Number= 76-188038}}</ref> . 

The availability of reliable contraception along with [[elderly care|support provided in old age]] by systems other than traditional familial ones has made childlessness an option for some people in [[developed country|developed countries]]. In most societies and for most of human history choosing to be childfree was both difficult and undesirable. To accomplish the goal of remaining childfree, some individuals undergo [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|medical sterilization]] or relinquish their children for [[adoption]].  . 

The term 'child free' is also used in Australia to indicate parents who are without children at the current time. This may be due to them living elsewhere on a permanent basis or a short-term solution such as childcare (Australian Institute of Family Studies, 2011).  . 

== History (Religion) == . 

[[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] wrote in the year 388 of the [[Manichaeism|Manichaeans]], who believed that it was immoral to create children, and thus (according to their belief system) trap souls in mortal bodies. <ref name=augustine /> To try to prevent this they practiced [[calendar-based methods|periodic abstinence]]. <!--

Christian sects whose views could be seen as supporting a childfree position include the [[Shakers]], a Protestant sect that opposed procreation, along with the [[Skoptsy]] and the [[Catharism|Cathars]]. In 12th and 13th centuries, the Cathars were a community which might have understood the contemporary idea of childfree. They accommodated sexual relations but considered procreation undesirable on theological grounds, regarding all matter as intrinsically evil. Most childless communities, such as monasteries or other religious communities, chose celibacy and organised single sex accommodation as means of achieving childlessness but did not regard children as undesirable. Such religious communities were childless (but not necessarily childfree) in order to devote their time to the service or worship of God or even to the care of other people’s children. They also had concerns about legal requirements to bequeath the community's property to offspring.  .

== Statistics and research ==. 
Overall, researchers have observed childfree couples to be more [[educated]], more likely to be employed in [[professional]] and [[management]] occupations, more likely for both spouses to earn relatively high incomes, to live in [[urban area]]s, to be less [[religious]], to subscribe to less traditional [[gender roles]], and to be less conventional. <ref name="blackwell-synergy.com">{{Cite journal|last = Park |first = Kristin | title = Choosing Childlessness: Weber's Typology of Action and Motives of the Voluntarily Childless | journal = Sociological Inquiry | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 372 | publisher = Blackwell Synergy | month = August | year = 2005| url =http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1475-682X.2005.00127.x |doi = 10.1111/j.1475-682X.2005.00127.x | accessdate = 2006-12-12 |first1 = Kristin }}</ref> Economist [[David Foot (economist)|David Foot]] of the [[University of Toronto]] concluded that the female's education is the most important determinant of the likelihood of her [[Fertility|reproducing]].

In 2003, a U.S. Census study  found that a record 19% of U.S. women age 40–44 did not have children (compared with 10% in 1976). Being childless was considered bizarre in the 1950s. <ref name="Long Road">{{cite news

The number of women in the U.S. who are without children is unknown, but the National Center of Health Statistics confirms that the percentage of American women of childbearing age who define themselves as childfree (or voluntarily childless) rose sharply in the 1990s—from 2.4 percent in 1982 to 4.3 percent in 1990 to 6.6 percent in 1995.  . 

== Controversy ==. 
Controversy surrounding the childfree state segments into criticism based on socio-political, feminist, or religious reasons.  . 

=== Feminism ===. 
Childfreedom may no longer be considered the 'best' way to be feminist. Once a paragon of [[second-wave feminism]], the nullipara (childless or childfree woman) is not typically described in [[third-wave feminism]] as being superior to, or more feminist than, women who choose to have children. Feminist author Daphne DeMarneffe links larger feminist issues to both the devaluation of motherhood in contemporary society, as well as the delegitimization of "maternal desire" and pleasure in motherhood. <ref>{{Cite news| first=Daphne| last=DeMarneffe| title=Maternal Desire: On Children, Love, and the Inner Life |publisher=Back Bay Books/Little, Brown, and Company|year=2005}}</ref> In third-wave handbook ''Manifesta: Young Women, Feminism, and the Future'', authors Jennifer Baumgardner and Amy Richards explore the concept of third-wave feminists reclaiming "girlie" culture, along with reasons why women of Baby Boomer and [[Generation X]] ages may reject motherhood because, at a young and impressionable age, they witnessed their own mothers being devalued by society and family. <ref>{{Cite news| first=Jennifer, Amy| last=Baumgardner, Richards| title= Manifesta: Young Women, Feminism, and the Future |publisher=Farrar, Straus, and Giroux| year=2000}}</ref> In many societies, it may be possible, then, to uphold feminist ideals and still be a mother.  . 

On the other hand, in "The Bust Guide to the New Girl Order"<ref>{{Cite news| first=Debbie, Marcelle| last=Stoller, Karp | title= The Bust Guide to the New Girl Order |publisher=Penguin| year=1999}}</ref> and in ''[[Utne Reader]]'' magazine, third-wave feminist writer [[Tiffany Lee Brown]] described the joys and freedoms of childfree living, freedoms such as travel previously associated with males in Western culture. In "Motherhood Lite," she celebrates being an aunt, co-parent, or family friend over the idea of being a mother. <ref>http://www.utne.com/2001-01-01/motherhood-lite.aspx</ref> . 

=== The "selfish" issue ===. 
Some opponents of the childfree choice consider such a choice to be "[[selfishness|selfish]]". The rationale of this position is the assertion that raising children is a very important activity (childfree author [[Virginia Postrel]] calls it "the most important work most people will ever do"), and so not engaging in this activity must therefore mean living one's life in service to one's self. The value judgment behind this idea is that individuals should endeavor to make some kind of meaningful contribution to the world, but also that the best way to make such a contribution is to have children.  For some people, one or both of these assumptions may be true, but others prefer to direct their time, energy, and talents elsewhere, in many cases toward improving the world that today's children occupy (and that future generations will inherit). <ref name=English>{{Cite news|first=Jane|last=English|title=Childlessness Transformed: Stories of Alternative Parenting| url=http://www.eheart.com/BOOKS/childless/index.html |publisher=Earth Heart|date=December 1986}}</ref> . 

Proponents of childfreedom posit that choosing ''not'' to have children is no more or less selfish than choosing to have children. In fact, choosing to have children may be the more selfish choice, especially when poor parenting risks creating many long term problems for both the children themselves and society at large. <ref>{{Cite news| first=Catherine| last=Leone| title=Fairness, Freedom and Responsibility: The Dilemma of Fertility Choice in America |publisher=Washington State University|date=December 1989}}</ref> As philosopher [[David Benatar]]<ref name=Benatar>{{Cite news| first=David| last=Benatar| title=Better Never to Have Been| publisher=Oxford University Press| date=2006-10-19}}</ref> explains, at the heart of the decision to bring a child into the world often lies the parents' own desires (to enjoy child-rearing), rather than the potential person's interests. 
At very least, Benatar believes this illustrates why a childfree person may be just as altruistic as any parent.  . 

There is also the question as to whether having children really is such a positive contribution to the world in an age when there are many concerns about [[overpopulation]], [[pollution]] and depletion of [[non-renewable resources]]. Some critics counter that such analyses of having children may understate its potential benefits to society (e.g. a greater labor force, which may provide greater opportunity to solve social problems) and overstate the costs. That is, there is often a need for a non-zero [[birth rate]]. <ref>http://www.slate.com/id/2037/</ref> . 

=== Overpopulation ===. 
{{See|Overpopulation}}
Some of the childfree believe that overpopulation is a serious problem and some question the fairness of what they feel amount to subsidies for having children, such as the [[Earned Income Tax Credit]] (US), free K–12 education paid for by all taxpayers, family medical leave, and other such programs. <ref name=Burkett>{{Cite news| first=Eleanor| last=Burkett| title=The Baby Boon| publisher=Simon & Schuster| date=2002-04}}</ref>
Others, however, do not believe overpopulation to be a problem in itself; regarding such problems as overcrowding, global warming, and straining food supplies to be problems of public policy and/or technology. <ref>{{Cite news|title=Overpopulation Myths |work=Daily Policy Digest, International Issues |publisher=National Center for Policy Analysis |date=1995-10-05 |url=http://www.ncpa.org/sub/dpd/index.php?page=article&Article_ID=13087 |accessdate=12 December 2006}}</ref> . 

Some have argued that this sort of [[conscientiousness]] is self-eliminating (assuming it is heritable), so by avoiding reproduction for ethical reasons the childfree will only aid deterioration of concern for the environment and future generations. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hardin |first=Garrett |date= December 13, 1968 |title=The Tragedy of the Commons |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |url=http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html |accessdate= 2008-01-25}}</ref> . 

=== Government and taxes ===. 
Some childfree individuals regard governmental or employer-based incentives offered only to parents—such as a per-child income tax credit, preferential absence planning, employment legislation, or special facilities—as intrinsically discriminatory, arguing for their removal, reduction, or the formation of a corresponding system of matching incentives for other categories of social relationships. Childfree advocates argue that other forms of caregiving have historically not been considered equal—that "only babies count"—and that this is an outdated idea that is in need of revision. Caring for [[Human care|sick, disabled]], or [[Elderly care|elderly]] dependents entails significant financial and emotional costs but is not currently subsidized in the same manner. This commitment has traditionally and increasingly fallen largely on women, contributing to the [[feminization of poverty]] in the U.S. <ref>{{cite conference|first=Carol|last=Levine|title=Panel Presentation: Long Term Care and Caregiving|location=[[White House|1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, D.C]]|url=http://www.rehab.research.va.gov/register/levine.htm}}</ref> . 

The focus on personal acceptance is mirrored in much of the literature surrounding choosing not to reproduce. Many early books were grounded in [[feminism|feminist]] theory and largely sought to dispel the idea that womanhood and motherhood were necessarily the same thing, arguing, for example, that childfree people face not only social discrimination but political discrimination as well. <ref name=Burkett /> . 

=== Religion ===. 
Religions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam place a high value on children and their central place in marriage.   In numerous works, including an Apostolic letter written in 1988,<ref>{{Cite journal
  | author = [[Pope John Paul II]]
  | title =Apostolic letter Mulieris Dignitatem

  | accessdate=12 December 2006}}</ref> [[Pope John Paul II]] has set forth the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] emphasis on the role of children in family life. However, the Catholic Church also stresses the value of [[chastity]] in the non-married state of life and so approves of nominally childfree ways of life for the single. Some religious interpretations hold that any couple who marries with the intention of not producing children is not married within the church.  . 

There are, however, some debates within religious groups about whether a childfree lifestyle is acceptable. Another view, for example, is that the biblical text Gen. 1:28 "Be fruitful and multiply," is really not a command but a blessing formula and that while there are many factors to consider as far as people's motives for remaining childless, there are many valid reasons, including dedicating one's time to demanding but good causes, why Christians may choose to remain childless for a short time or a lifetime. <ref>{{Cite news

== Organizations and political activism ==. 
Childfree individuals do not necessarily share a unified political or economic philosophy, and most prominent childfree organizations tend to be social in nature. Childfree social groups first emerged in the 1970s, most notable among them The National Organization for Non-Parents and [[No Kidding!]] in North America where numerous books have been written about childfree people and where a range of social positions related to childfree interests have developed along with political and social activism in support of these interests. The term "childfree" was used in a July 3, 1972 [[Time (magazine)|Time]] article on the creation of the National Organization for Non-Parents. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,877830,00.html | work=Time | title=Behavior: Down with Kids | date=1972-07-03}}</ref> It was revived in the 1990s when Leslie Lafayette formed a later childfree group, the Childfree Network. <ref>{{Cite news| first=Madelyn| last=Cain| title= The Childless Revolution |publisher=Purseus Publishing| year=2001}} page 20. </ref> . 

The National Organization for Non-Parents (N.O.N.) was begun in Palo Alto, CA by [[Ellen Peck]] and Shirley Radl in 1972.  N.O.N. was formed to advance the notion that men and women could choose not to have children—to be childfree.  Changing its name to The [[National Alliance for Optional Parenthood]], it continued into the early 1980s both as a support group for those making the decision to be childfree and an advocacy group fighting pronatalism (attitudes/advertising/etc. promoting or glorifying parenthood).  According to its bylaws, the purpose of the National Alliance for Optional Parenthood was to educate the public on non-parenthood as a valid lifestyle option, support those who choose not to have children, promote awareness of the overpopulation problem, and assist other groups that advanced the goals of the organization. N.O.N.'s offices were located in Reisterstown, MD; then Baltimore, MD; and, ultimately, in Washington, D.C. N.O.N. designated August 1 as Non-Parents' Day.Just as people with children come from all shades of the political spectrum and temper their beliefs accordingly, so do the childfree. For example, while some childfree people think of [[government]] welfare to parents as "lifestyle subsidies," others accept the need to assist such individuals but think that their lifestyle should be equally compensated. Still others accept the need to help out such individuals and also do not ask for subsidies of their own.  . 

There are suggestions of an emergence of political cohesion, for example an Australian Childfree Party (ACFP) proposed in Australia as a childfree political party, promoting the childfree lifestyle as opposed to the family lifestyle.  Increasing politicization and [[Mass media|media]] interest has led to the emergence of a second wave of childfree organizations that are openly political in their raisons d'être, with a number of attempts to mobilize political pressure groups in the U.S.  The first organization to emerge was [[Great Britain|British]], known as [[Kidding Aside]].  The childfree movement has not had significant political impact.  .
