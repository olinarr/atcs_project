== Historical backdrop ==. 
{{seealso|History of birth control}}
Some of the beliefs held among Quiverfull adherents have been held among various Christians during prior eras of [[Christian history|history]]. As birth control methods advanced during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many conservative Christian movements issued official statements against their use. Some contend that Quiverfull's 'internal growth' model is a manifestation of a broader trend reflected in such groups as the ultra-Orthodox Jews, Salafi Muslims, Orthodox Calvinists of Holland and Laestadian Lutherans of Finland. <ref> Kaufmann, Eric. 2011.

=== Anglican allowance of birth control and feminism ===. 
In 1930 the [[Lambeth Conference]] issued a statement permitting birth control "Where there is a clearly felt moral obligation to limit or avoid parenthood, complete abstinence is the primary and obvious method," but if there was morally sound reasoning for avoiding abstinence, "the Conference agrees that other methods may be used, provided that this is done in the light of Christian principles." [http://anglicanhistory.org/misc/contraception/ Primary materials] on the contemporary debate indicate a wide variety of opinion on the matter. Coinciding, a [[feminists|feminist]] movement that began about a decade earlier under [[American Birth Control League]] (which eventually became [[Planned Parenthood]]) founder [[Margaret Sanger]] emerged to advocate for modern birth control. <ref name="lobbying">{{cite journal | author=Benjamin, Hazel C.| title=Lobbying for Birth Control| journal=The Public Opinion Quarterly| year=1938| volume=2| issue=1| pages=48–60| doi=10.1086/265152| jstor=2745054}}</ref><ref name="sanger1">{{cite book | title=Birth Control in America: The Career of Margaret Sanger| last=Kennedy| first=David M.| date=1970 (2001)| publisher=Yale University Press (ACLS History E-Book Project)| isbn=1-59740-178-1}}</ref>  In the decades that followed, birth control became gradually accepted among Protestants, even among the most conservative evangelicals. <ref name="flann">{{cite journal | author=Campbell, Flann| title=Birth Control and the Christian Churches| journal=Population Studies| year=Nov., 1960| volume= 14| issue= 2| pages=131–147| doi=10.2307/2172010| jstor=2172010}}</ref><ref name="allen">{{cite journal | author=Allen, James E.| title=Family Planning Attitudes of Seminary Students| journal=Review of Religious Research| year=1976| volume=9| issue=1| pages=52–55| doi=10.2307/3509598| jstor=3509598}}</ref><ref name="affiliation">{{cite journal | author=Goldschneider, Calvin, and William D.

=== Early Quiverfull authors ===. 
[[File:Mary pride thewayhome.jpg|120px|thumb|Mary Pride's first book, ''The Way Home: Beyond Feminism Back to Reality'' (1985), is credited as helping to spearhead the Quiverfull movement.]]
:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''Main article: [[Mary Pride]]''
:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''Also see: [[Feminism]], [[Anti-feminism]], and [[Birth control]]'' . 

Within that context, Quiverfull as a modern [[Christian movements|Christian movement]] began to emerge. <ref name="explaindiffs">{{cite journal | author=Marcum, John P.| title=Explaining Fertility Differences among U.S. Protestants| journal=Social Forces| year=1981| volume=60| issue=2| pages=532–543| doi=10.2307/2578449| jstor=2578449}}</ref> While a newsletter by Nancy Campbell espoused Quiverfull ideas early, and Campbell is in measure responsible for formulating them, the movement sparked most fully after the 1985 [[publication]] of [[Mary Pride|Mary Pride’s]] book ''The Way Home: Beyond Feminism, Back to Reality.'' . 

In her book, Pride chronicled her journey away from what she labeled [[feminist]] and anti-natal ideas of [[happiness]], within which she had lived as an [[activist]] before her [[Christian conversion|conversion]] to [[Christian right|conservative]] [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christianity]] in 1977, toward her discovery of happiness surrounding what she said was the biblically mandated role of wives and mothers as bearers of children and workers in the home under the [[Traditional authority|authority]] of a [[husband]]. Pride wrote that such a lifestyle was generally biblically required of all married Christian women but that most Christian women had been unknowingly duped by feminism, especially in their acceptance of birth control. <ref name="consvprots"/><ref name="pride">{{cite book | title=The Way Home: Beyond Feminism, Back to Reality| last=Pride| first=Mary| year=1985| publisher=Good News Publishers| location=Wheaton, IL| isbn=0-89107-345-0}}

[[File:Fullquiverofarrows.jpg|thumb|120px|left|The Christian quiverfull movement derives its name from [[Psalms|Psalm]] 127:3-5, where many children are metaphorically referred to as the arrows in a full quiver.]]
As the basis for her arguments, Pride selected numerous [[Bible verses]] to lay out what she felt was the biblical role of women. These included verses she saw as containing her ideas of childbearing and non-usage of [[birth control]], which she argued were opposed to what she called "the feminist agenda" by which she had formerly lived.  Pride's explanations became a spearheading basis of Quiverfull.  . 

The name of the Quiverfull movement comes from the [[Old Testament]] Bible verses in Psalm 127:3-5 that Pride cited in ''The Way Home''. <ref name="pride"/> . 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD:<br>
and the fruit of the womb is his reward. <br>
As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man;<br>
so are children of the youth. <br>
Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them:<br>
they shall not be ashamed,<br>
but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.[[King James Version|KJV]]
</BLOCKQUOTE> . 

Pride stated in her book, "The church’s sin which has caused us to become unsavory salt incapable of uplifting the society around us is selfishness, lack of love, refusing to consider children an unmitigated blessing. In a word, family planning."<ref name="pride"/> . 

=== Consolidation and growth of the movement===. 
After the publication of Pride’s ''The Way Home'', various church women and others took up her book and ideas and spread them through informal [[social network]]s. Around this time, numerous church [[pastor]]s issued [[sermon]]s in accord with Pride's ideas and various small publications and a few Quiverfull-oriented books emerged.  . 

As the [[Internet]] expanded several years later, the informal networks gradually took on more organized forms as Quiverfull adherents developed numerous Quiverfull-oriented organizations, books, [[listserv]]es, [[websites]], and [[Digest size|digests]], most notably ''The Quiverfull Digest''. The largely decentralized "Quiverfull" movement resulted. <ref name="joyce"/><ref name="nightline2">{{cite book | title=The More the Holier?| date=January 3, 2006| publisher=ABC News Nightline}}</ref> . 

From their onset, Quiverfull ideas have sometimes had a polarizing effect between Christians who hold to the position and those who are skeptical of or disagree with them. <ref name="consvprots">{{cite journal | author=Christopher G. Ellison and Patricia Goodson| title=Conservative Protestantism and Attitudes toward Family Planning in a Sample of Seminarians| journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion| year=1997| volume=36| issue=4| pages=512–529| doi=10.2307/1387687| jstor=1387687}}</ref><ref name="protsandfp">{{cite journal | author=Goodman, Patricia| title=Protestants and Family Planning| journal=Journal of Religion and Health| year=1997| volume=36| issue= 4| url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/gg08414n38g4x820/fulltext.pdf| pages=353–366| doi=10.1023/A:1027437310363|format=PDF}}</ref> . 

== Motivations ==. 
=== Obedience to God ===. 
Quiverfull authors and adherents express their core motivation as a desire to obey God's commands as stated in the Bible. Among these commands, "be fruitful and multiply",{{bibleref2c|Gen|1:22;8:17;9:1}} "behold, children are a gift of the Lord"),{{bibleref2c|Psalm|127:3}} and passages showing God acting to open and close the womb{{bibleref2c|Gen|20:18;29:31;30:22}}{{bibleref2c|1Sam|1:5-6}}{{bibleref2c|Isaiah|66:9}} are interpreted as giving basis for their view. Quiverfull adherents typically maintain that their philosophy is first about an open, accepting and obedient attitude toward the possibility of birthing children. Within the view, this attitude may result in many, few or even no children, because God Himself maintains sole provenance over conception and birth. The duty of the Quiverfull adherent is only to maintain an "open willingness" to joyfully receive and not thwart however many children God chooses to bestow. Contraception in all its forms is seen as inconsistent with this attitude and is thus entirely avoided, as is [[abortion]].  . 

=== Missionary effort ===. 
Quiverfull's principal authors and its adherents also describe their motivation as a [[missionaries|missionary effort]] to raise up many Christian children to advance the cause of the Christian religion. <ref name="hess"/> Its distinguishing viewpoint is to eagerly receive children as blessings from God,<ref name="hess"/><ref name="campN"/> eschewing all forms of [[contraception]], including [[natural family planning]] and [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]]. <ref name="joyce"/><ref name="pride"/> . 

=== Population and demography === . 

According to journalist Kathryn Joyce, writing in the magazine ''[[The Nation]]'': "[T]he Quiverfull mission is rooted in faith, the unseen, its mandate to be fruitful and multiply," even if it "has tangible results as well."<ref name="joyce"/> Although Joyce claims that "Population is a preoccupation for many Quiverfull believers... [and] [t]he motivations aren't always racist, but the subtext of "race suicide" is often there."<ref name="joyce"/> Still, she asserts, "This is what Quiverfull is about: faith, pure and simple."<ref name="joyce"/> Others remark that Quiverfull resembles other world-denying fundamentalist movements that grow through internal reproduction and membership retention such as ultra-Orthodox Jews, Amish, Laestadian Lutherans in Finland and Salafis in the Muslim world. Many are thriving as seculars and moderates have transitioned to below-replacement fertility. <ref> Kaufmann, Eric. 2011.

== Beliefs ==. 
[[File:Fullquiver.jpg|thumb|120px|left|The cover of the 1990 ''A Full Quiver: Family Planning and the Lordship of Christ'' by Rick and Jan Hess.]] . 

The principal Quiverfull belief is that Christians should maintain a strongly welcoming attitude toward the possibility of bearing children. With minor exceptions, adherents reject birth control use as completely incompatible with this belief.  . 

===Majority doctrine=== . 

Most Quiverfull adherents regard children as unqualified blessings, gifts that should be received happily from God. Quiverfull authors Rick and Jan Hess argued for this belief in their 1990 book.  . 

<blockquote>
"Behold, children are a gift of the Lord." (Psa. 127:3) Do we really believe that? If children are a gift from God, let’s for the sake of argument ask ourselves what other gift or blessing from God we would reject. Money? Would we reject great wealth if God gave it? Not likely! How about good health? Many would say that a man’s health is his most treasured possession. But children? Even children given by God? "That’s different!" some will plead! All right, is it different? God states right here in no-nonsense language that children are gifts. Do we believe His Word to be true?<ref name="hess"/>
</blockquote>
Quiverfull authors such as Pride, Provan, and Hess extend this idea to mean that if one child is a blessing, then each additional child is likewise a blessing and not something to be viewed as economically burdensome or unaffordable. When a couple seeks to control family size via birth control they are thus "rejecting God's blessings" he might otherwise give and possibly breaking his commandment to "be fruitful and multiply". <ref name="hess"/><ref name="pride"/><ref name="provan">{{cite book | title=The Bible and Birth Control| last=Provan| first=Charles D.| year=1989| publisher=Zimmer Printing| location=Monongahela, PA| isbn=99917-998-3-4}}. Quote and its chapter available at http://www.jesus-passion.com/contraception.htm</ref><ref name="bythedozen">{{cite journal | author=Robben, Donetta| title=Blessings by the Dozen| journal=American Life League Magazine| year=2006| volume=Sept.-Oct.| url=http://www.clmagazine.org/backissues/2006septoct_10-13blessingsbythedozen.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>
[[File:Charles D. Provan - The Bible and Birth Control.jpg|120px|thumb|[[Charles D. Provan]]'s 1989 ''The Bible and Birth Control'' is credited as strengthening the theological justification for the Quiverfull movement.]]
Accordingly, Quiverfull theology opposes the general acceptance among Protestant Christians of deliberately limiting family size or spacing children through birth control. For example, Mary Pride argued, "God commanded that sex be at least potentially fruitful (that is, not deliberately unfruitful).... All forms of sex that shy away from marital fruitfulness are perverted."<ref name="pride"/> Adherents believe that God himself controls via [[Divine Providence|Providence]] how many and how often children are conceived and born, pointing to Bible verses that describe God acting to "open and close the womb" (see [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2020:18;&version=49; Genesis 20:18], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2029:31;&version=49; 29:31], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2030:22;&version=49; 30:22]; [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%201:5-6;&version=49; 1 Samuel 1:5-6]; [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2066:9;&version=49; Isaiah 66:9]). <ref name="hess"/><ref name="scott">{{cite book | title=Birthing God's Mighty Warriors| last=Scott| first=Rachel| year=2004| publisher=Xulon Press| location=Longwood, FL| isbn = 1-59467-465-5}}</ref> Hess and Hess state that couples "just need to trust God to provide them with the perfect number of children for their situation."<ref name="hess"/> . 

Some Quiverfull adherents base their rejection of birth control upon the belief that the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis creation]] and post-[[Noah|Noahic flood]] Bible passages to "be fruitful and multiply" (see [http://bible.cc/genesis/1-22.htm Genesis 1:22]; [http://bible.cc/genesis/9-7.htm 9:7]) are un-rescinded biblical commandments. For example, [[Charles D. Provan]] argues: . 

<blockquote>
"Be fruitful and multiply" ... is a command of God, indeed the first command to a married couple. Birth control obviously involves disobedience to this command, for birth control attempts to prevent being fruitful and multiplying. Therefore birth control is wrong, because it involves disobedience to the Word of God. Nowhere is this command done away with in the entire Bible; therefore it still remains valid for us today. <ref name="provan"/>
</blockquote> . 

Quiverfull advocates such as Hess and Hess and [[Rachel Giove Scott]] believe that the [[Devil in Christianity|Devil]] deceives Christian couples into using birth control so that children God otherwise willed to create are prevented from being born. <ref name="hess"/><ref name="scott"/> A Quiverfull adherent quoted in 1991 in the ''[[Calgary Herald]]'' made the statement: "Children are made in God's image, and the enemy hates that image, so the more of them he can prevent from being born, the more he likes it."<ref name="QF-Canda">{{cite journal | author=Joe Woodward| title=The godliness of fertility: A growing Protestant movement is rediscovering the sanctification available in large families| journal=Calgary Herald| year=Mar. 31, 2001| url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=207093851&sid=1&Fmt=3&clientId=6993&RQT=309&VName=PQD| pages=OS.10}}</ref> . 

====Infertility====. 
Adherents view [[barrenness]], referred to as an "empty quiver" by adherents, as something to be accepted from God if that is His choice, while also making it a matter of prayer in the belief that God may wish to miraculously intervene.  Quiverfull sees [[infertility| infertility treatments]] as a usurpation of God's [[Divine Providence|providence]] and accordingly reject them. Adoption is viewed as a positive option in which couples also rely on God's providence to send children. Biblical references to God's love for the orphan and to the belief that people are saved through adoption into God's family are often noted.  . 

Some circles do accept medical interventions, if they are not inherently abortifacient, since improving opportunities for pregnancy is not seen to guarantee it any more than with any healthy couple.  Also, some reproductive health problems may be symptomatic of other health problems that need to be addressed generally.  . 

===Minority doctrine===. 
Not all Quiverfull families and authors would agree with each statement made by the movement's principal authors.  . 

Samuel Owens considers that some aspects of a fallen universe may possibly sometimes justify an option to use a [[Beginning of pregnancy controversy|non&ndash;potentially abortive birth control method]]. Example situations include serious illnesses, inevitable Caesarian sections, and other problematic situations, such as disabling mental instability and serious marital disharmony. Owens additionally argues that birth control may be permissible for married couples called to a "higher moral purpose" than having children, such as caring long-term for many [[orphan]]s or serving as career [[missionary|missionaries]] in a dangerous location. <ref name="Owen">{{cite book | title=Letting God Plan Your Family| last=Owen, Jr.| first=Samuel A.| year=1990| publisher=Crossway Books| location=Wheaton, IL| isbn = 0-89107-585-2}}</ref> . 

Despite some variances, all Quiverfull families and authors agree that God's normative ideal for happy, healthy and prosperous married couples is to take no voluntary actions to prevent having children. <ref name="hess"/><ref name="campN"/> . 

== Practices ==. 
===Non-use of contraception===. 
:''Also see: [[Fertility]] and [[Infertility]], and [[Christian views on contraception#Protestant Christianity|Protestant views on contraception]]''
Quiverfull adherents maintain that God "opens and closes the womb" of a woman on a case-by-case basis, and that attempts to regulate fertility are a subjugation of divine power. Thus, the defining practice of a Quiverfull married couple is not to use any form of birth control and to maintain continual "openness to children", to the possibility of [[Conception (biology)|conception]], during routine [[sexual intercourse]] irrespective of timing of the month during the [[ovulation]] cycle. This is considered by Quiverfull adherents to be a principal, if not the primary, aspect of their Christian calling in submission to the lordship of [[Christ]]. <ref name="joyce2">{{cite web|url=http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/blog/2006/11/30/quiverfull-more-children-for-gods-army|title=Quiverfull: More Children For God's Army|accessdate=2007-01-09|publisher=RH Reality Check|author=Kathryn Joyce}}</ref> . 

Some Quiverfull adherents advocate for [[child spacing]] through [[breastfeeding]], so return of fertility after childbirth could be delayed by [[lactational amenorrhea method|lactational amenorrhea]], although this is far from certain.  . 

===Family organization, homeschooling, homesteading=== . 

:''Also see: [[Dominionism]], and [[Patriarchy]]'' . 

Quiverfull authors and adherents advocate for and seek to model [[Nativism (politics)|a return to]] [[Biblical Patriarchy]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Mary Pride recently distanced herself from the patriarchy movement in an article for Practical Homeschooling. In her article, she clearly stated her disapproval of the movement, and sets the record straight that she should not be considered a founder of it. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.home-school.com/Articles/phs89-marypride.html |title=Homeschool World: Practical Homeschooling Articles: Patriarchy, Meet Matriarchy |publisher=Home-school.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19}}</ref> . 

Quiverfull authors typically organize family governance with the mother as a [[homemaker]] under the [[authority]] of her [[husband]] with the children under the authority of both. Parents seek to largely shelter their children from aspects of culture they as parents deem adversarial to their religious beliefs. Additionally, Quiverfull families strongly incline toward [[homeschooling]] and toward [[homesteading]] in a [[rural]] area. However, exceptions exist in substantial enough proportion that these latter two items are general and often idealized correlates to Quiverfull practices and not integral parts of them. <ref name="patri">{{cite journal | author=Biggar, R.J., and M.

===Sterilization reversals=== . 

Quiverfull adherents Brad and Dawn Irons run ''Blessed Arrows Sterilization Reversal Ministry''. The couple advocates for Quiverfull ideas while providing funding, physician referrals, and support to Protestants wishing to undergo [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] reversal surgery. <ref name="reverse">{{cite web|url=http://www.blessedarrows.org/|title=Blessed Arrows: A Sterilization Reversal Ministry|accessdate = 2006-10-14|publisher=Brad and Dawn Irons|author=Brad and Dawn Irons}}</ref>
Protestants such as [[Bill Gothard]] also advocate for reversals, saying that sterilized couples have "cut off children" but should instead devote themselves to "raising up godly seed".  .

Meyers examines the biblical and theological arguments that Pride puts forth and carefully points out what he considers to be shortcomings of her interpretations. <ref name="JJMeyers">{{cite book | title=Does the Bible Forbid Family Planning?: A Biblical and Theological Evaluation of Mary Pride's Arguments Against All Forms of Birth Control| last=Meyers| first=Jeffrey J.| year=1990| publisher=Biblical Horizons| location=Niceville, FL}}

[[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]]'s ''Desiring God Ministries'' made some comments that relate to Quiverfull by saying that: . 

<blockquote>
"just because something is a gift from the Lord does not mean that it is wrong to be a steward of when or whether you will come into possession of it. It is wrong to reason that since ''A'' is good and a gift from the Lord, then we must pursue as much of ''A'' as possible. God has made this a world in which tradeoffs have to be made and we cannot do everything to the fullest extent. For kingdom purposes, it might be wise not to get married. And for kingdom purposes, it might be wise to regulate the size of one's family and to regulate when the new additions to the family will likely arrive. As Wayne Grudem has said, 'it is okay to place less emphasis on some good activities in order to focus on other good activities.'"<ref name="piper">{{cite web|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/QuestionsAndAnswers/ByTopic/45/1440_Does_the_Bible_permit_birth_control/|title=Does the Bible permit birth control?|accessdate = 2006-10-27|publisher=Desiring God|year=2006|author=Desiring God Staff|work=Questions and Answers}}</ref>

Cheryl Lindsey Seelhoff, a former ardent Quiverfull adherent, mother by birth of eleven children, and former editor of ''Gentle Spirit Magazine'', argues that the Quiverfull movement is one "in which women and children are routinely and systematically subordinated and subjugated by the men in their lives - fathers, husbands, older sons,. . .pastors, elders, leaders - as a matter of biblical principle."<ref name="Seelhoff-3">{{cite journal | author=Cheryl Lindsey Seelhoff| title=I Name (and Blame) the Patriarchs, Part 2: Fallacies About the Full Quiver Movement| journal=Of Our Backs Feminist Newsjournal| date=November 29, 2006| url=http://womensspace.wordpress.com/2006/11/29}}</ref>  Seelhoff charges that Quiverful adherents "never talk about the victims of the movement," other than to distance themselves from the charges by explaining that the victims are aberrations. <ref name="Seelhoff-1">{{cite journal | author=Cheryl Lindsey Seelhoff| title=I Name the Patriarchs, Part I: The Truth About "Full Quiver" Families| journal=Women's Space Word Press| date=November 14, 2006| url=http://womensspace.wordpress.com/2006/11/14/i-name-the-patriarchy-part-i-the-truth-about-full-quiver-women/}}</ref><ref name="Seelhoff-2">{{cite journal | author=Cheryl Lindsey Seelhoff| title=Confronting the Religious Right| journal=Of Our Backs Feminist Newsjournal| year=2006| volume=36| issue=3}}</ref> . 

==Quiverfull in U.S. national press== . 

While Quiverfull had previously garnered some attention in the Christian press,<ref name="cbn"/><ref name="ct">{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2006/august/15.26.html|title=The Case for Kids|accessdate=2006-12-21|publisher=Christianity Today|date=1 August 2006|author=Leslie Leyland Fields}}</ref> the Canadian press in March 2001,<ref name="QF-Canda"/> and in various scholarly pieces, it began to receive focused attention in the U.S. national press in 2004.  . 

=== ''New York Times'' === . 

In an article on December 7, 2004, ''[[New York Times]]'' journalist [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] described a rising movement he called simply "[[natalism]]" and sought to show how in the future it could shift the U.S. political landscape from a philosophy of [[liberalism]] to [[conservatism]]. Brooks concluded, "Natalists are associated with [[Red states and blue states|red America]], but they're not launching a [[jihad]]". <ref name="joyce"/><ref name="nytimes"/> . 

=== ABC Good Morning America === . 

On July 25, 2005, ABC Good Morning America segment, "Is eight really enough?" Deborah Roberts interviews Rachel Scott, author of "Birthing God's Mighty Warriors".

=== ''The Nation'' === . 

Journalist [[Kathryn Joyce]] connected Brooks' "natalism" with Quiverfull and disagreed with him in her November 9, 2006, 5-page article on Quiverfull in ''[[The Nation]]''. Joyce emphasized that the movement uses what she described as "[[military-industrial]] terminology" to articulate the belief that "only a determination among Christian women to take up their submissive, motherly roles with a 'military air'" and within a milieu of becoming "maternal missionaries" will lead to what Joyce described as Quiverfull's "Christian army" achieving cultural "victory."<ref name="joyce"/> . 

=== ''Newsweek'' === . 

Four days later, on November 13, 2006, ''[[Newsweek]]'' provided a 2-page piece on Quiverfull, characterizing the movement as conservatives who are "reacting to revolutionary changes in women's social roles and seeking to re-impose a more traditional order". The piece ended by quoting a Quiverfull family describing themselves as "exponentially happier" after the wife relinquished control of her womb to God. <ref name="newsweek">{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15701301/site/newsweek/|title=Making Babies the Quiverfull Way|accessdate=2006-12-21|publisher=Newsweek Magazine|date=13 November 2006|author=Eileen Finan |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070103185954/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15701301/site/newsweek/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-01-03}}</ref>  On March 17, 2009, ''Newsweek'' published a second piece on Quiverfull through their website. <ref name="newsweek2">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2009/03/16/extreme-motherhood.html|title=Extreme Motherhood:Inside the Duggar Family's Conservative Ideology|accessdate=16 February 2011|publisher=Newsweek Magazine|date=17 March 2009|author=Kathryn Joyce}}</ref> .

===Quiverfull responses=== . 

In the proximate aftermath of the U.S. national print articles, responses from Quiverfull adherents in ''The Quiverfull Digest'' ranged from "feeling betrayed" to assertions that the articles were "fair". <ref name="QFDigest">{{cite web|url=http://www.quiverfull.com/digest.php|title=The Quiverfull Digest|accessdate=Fall-Winter 2006|publisher=The Quiverfull Digest|year=2006}}</ref> Additionally, a few disagreeing Quiverfull adherents undertook [[apologetic]] responses on the Internet discussion forums provided by the latter national publishers in immediate on-site connection with their articles. <ref name="joyce"/><ref name="newsweek"/> .

==Notable former adherents==. 
*'''[[Andrea Yates]]''' - a woman from Houston, Texas, USA, who, after suffering for years with very severe postpartum depression and psychosis, drowned her five young children in a bathtub on June 20, 2001.  Her first psychiatrist, Dr. Eileen Starbranch, warned Yates and her husband against having more children, stating in Yates's medical record two days later, '"Apparently patient and husband plan to have as many babies as nature will allow! This will surely guarantee future psychotic depression."<ref>O'Malley, p. 41; Yates' husband takes stand, CBS News, Feb. 26, 2002 [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/02/28/national/main502440.shtml Article]</ref><ref>{{cite journal

For instance, Andrea Yates, the Texas mother who received national attention in the United States for drowning her five children in a bathtub in the 1990s, is a perfect example of the mental and emotional strain the Quiverfull lifestyle can have on a woman. Few people realize Yates and her husband subscribed to the movement's beliefs, and this places further emphasis on the need to highlight the ideology of this movement.
