'''Natalism''' (also called '''pronatalism''' or the '''pro-birth''' position) is a belief that promotes [[human reproduction]]. The term is taken from the Latin adjective form for "birth", ''natalis''. Natalism promotes [[child-bearing]] and glorifies [[parent]]hood. It typically advocates policies such as limiting access to [[abortion]] and [[contraception]], as well as creating financial and social incentives for the population to reproduce.  . 

==Philosophy==. 
The degree of natalism is individual; the extreme end is "Natalism" as a [[life stance]] (with capitalized first letter by [[life stance orthography]]), which holds natalism as of [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|ultimate importance]] and everything else is only good to the extent it serves this purpose. The more moderate stance holds that there ought to be a higher rate of [[population growth]] than what is currently mainstream in industrialized countries. Philosophic motivations for natalism may include that of considering [[value (ethics)|value]] in bringing [[potential person|potential future persons]] into existence.  . 

==In religion==. 
Many religions, including [[Islam]], [[Judaism]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ca2/NipponDawn/torah.html|title=Joys of A Large Family|accessdate=2008-11-12|author= Twerski, Rebbetzin Feige}}</ref> and some forms of [[Christianity]], such as [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html|title=Humanae Vitae: Encyclical of Pope Paul VI on the Regulation of Birth|author=Pope Paul VI|authorlink=Pope Paul VI|date=1968-07-25|accessdate=2008-11-12|publisher=[[Vatican Publishing House|Libreria Editrice Vaticana]]|location=[[Vatican City]]}}</ref> with its [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacrament of marriage]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_31121930_casti-connubii_en.html|title=Casti Connubii: Encyclical of Pope Pius XI on Christian Marriage|author=Pope Pius XI|authorlink=Pope Pius XI|date=1930-12-31|accessdate=2008-11-12|publisher=[[Vatican Publishing House|Libreria Editrice Vaticana]]|location=[[Vatican City]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_jp-ii_exh_19811122_familiaris-consortio_en.html|title=Apostolic Exhortation Familiaris Consortio: On the Role of the Christian Family in the Modern World|author=Pope John Paul II|authorlink= Pope John Paul II|date=1981-11-22|accessdate=2008-11-12|publisher=[[Vatican Publishing House|Libreria Editrice Vaticana]]|location=[[Vatican City]]}}</ref> encourage procreation.  .

A recent movement among conservative Protestants, known as the [[Quiverfull|Quiverfull movement]], advocates for large families. 
Some scholars remark that Quiverfull resembles other world-denying fundamentalist movements that grow through internal reproduction and membership retention such as ultra-Orthodox Jews, Amish, Laestadian Lutherans in Finland and Salafis in the Muslim world. Many are thriving as seculars and moderates have transitioned to below-replacement fertility. <ref>Kaufmann, Eric. 2011.

The canonical text of Hinduism known as <i>manusmriti</i> (<i>The Code of Manu</i>) also encourages reproduction, equating childbearing with the gods' acts of creation as in verses 88-90: "He who persistently performs acts leading to future births (pravritta) becomes equal to the gods; but he who is intent on the performance of those causing the cessation of existence, nivritta indeed, passes beyond the reach of the five elements."<ref>http://www.bergen.edu/phr/121/ManuGC.pdf</ref> Furthermore in verse 227: "That trouble and pain which the parents undergo on the birth of their children cannot be compensated even in a hundred years." However, there is a strong tradition of [[Celibacy#Hinduism|celibacy in Hinduism]] practiced by ascetics.  . 

==Natalistic politics==. 
{{See|Population decline}} . 

Nativity in the Western world dropped during the [[interwar period]]. Swedish sociologists [[Alva|Alva Myrdal]] and [[Gunnar Myrdal]] published [[Crisis in the Population Question]] in 1934, suggesting an extensive [[welfare state]] with free healthcare and childcare, to level the number of children at a reproductive level for all social classes. [[Demographics of Sweden|Swedish fertility]] rose throughout World War II (as [[Sweden during World War II|Sweden was largely unharmed by the war]]) and peaked in 1946.  . 

Today, Sweden has generous family politics, as well as a growing population.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} . 

Many countries with [[population decline]] offer incentives to the people to have large families as a means of [[Population decline#National_efforts_to_reverse_declining_populations|national efforts to reverse declining populations]]. Some nations such as [[Japan]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], and [[Taiwan]] have implemented, or tried to implement, interventionist natalist policies, creating incentives for larger families among "native stock."{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  Immigrants are generally not part of natalist policies.  . 

Another government which has openly advocated natalism is the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]], following a tremendous loss of their population to the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. The government encouraged married couples to produce as many children as possible to replace population lost to the war. As a result of this natalist attitude, Iran has experienced a [[youth bulge]], with approximately 75% of its population under the age of 30 as of 2007.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} .

The birthrate surge taxed the public services received by the ''[[decreţei]]'' ("Scions of the decree [770]") generation. 
The [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]] was followed by a fall in population growth.  . 

According to [[Tibetologist]] [[Melvyn Goldstein]], natalist feelings run high in China's [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet region]], among both ordinary people and government officials. Seeing [[population control]] "as a matter of power and ethnic survival" rather than in terms of ecological [[sustainability]], Tibetans have successfully argued for an exemption of [[Tibetan people|their ethnicity]] from usual Chinese [[family planning]] policies, such as the [[one-child policy]]. <ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1525/as.1991.31.3.00p0043x|title=China's Birth Control Policy in the Tibet Autonomous Region|journal=[[Asian Survey]]|authorlink=Melvyn Goldstein|first=Melvyn|last=Goldstein|first2=Beall|last2=Cynthia|year=1991|month=March|volume=31|issue=3|pages=285–303}}</ref> Natalist literature among the Tibetan exile community discourages [[miscegenation|sex with foreigners]], however it is not particularly successful. <ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1525/var.2006.22.2.34|title=Reproducing Identity: Using Images to Promote Pronatalism and Sexual Endogamy among Tibetan Exiles in South Asia by Gareth Barkin & Geoff Childs|date=2006-03-30|publisher=[[Visual Anthropology]]}}</ref> .

The article is referred to in an analysis of the [[Quiverfull]] movement. <ref>[http://www.thenation.com/docprint.mhtml?i=20061127&s=joyce The Nation accessed 21 Jan 06]</ref> However, the figures identified for the demographic are extremely low.  . 

Paid [[Parental leave|maternity and paternity leave policies]] can also be used as an incentive. For example, Sweden has generous parental leave where parents are entitled to share 16 months paid leave per child, the cost divided between both employer and State.  . 

Some countries offer a one off [[Baby Bonus|financial payment]] to encourage couples to bear more children.  .

In the United States, [[Rick Santorum]] made natalism part of his platform for his [[Rick Santorum presidential campaign, 2012|2012 presidential campaign]]. <ref name="santorum">{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-live/2012/01/santorum-more-babies-please-110897.html|title=Santorum: More babies, please!}}</ref> This is not an isolated case. Many of those categorized in the General Social Survey as "Fundamentalist Protestant" are more or less natalist, and have a higher birth rate than "Moderate" and "Liberal" Protestants. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6385.2010.00517.x/abstract|title=Modern Protestant Natalism, Dialog 2010}}</ref> . 

==Antinatalism==. 
{{Main| antinatalism}}
{{Refimprove|date=September 2010}} . 

Official anti or pro-natalist policies can be oppressive of [[reproductive rights]], depending on how they are structured and enforced.  . 

Antinatalism may also be included in concern of [[overpopulation]] and its effects, e.g. as a [[mitigation of global warming]] and societal or [[moral decline]].  . 

==Egoistic natalism==. 
Although generally it refers to humanity as a whole, one variant of natalism promotes self-reproduction, even if it may inhibit other people's reproduction. For instance, some men have used their own sperm to [[artificially inseminate]] women, without their consent,<ref>Nelson, Rick.  ''The Babymaker: Fertility Fraud and the Fall of Doctor [[Cecil Jacobson]]'', 1993. ISBN 0-553-56162-6</ref> and egoistic natalism may have been the motive.  . 

However, natalism generally refers to the reproduction of the large-scale population.  .
