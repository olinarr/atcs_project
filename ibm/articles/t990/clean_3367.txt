Antinatalism is a philosophical position that assigns a negative value to birth, standing in opposition to natalism. It has been advanced by figures such as Arthur Schopenhauer [REF]. Groups that encourage antinatalism, or pursue antinatalist policies, include the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement and the Club of Rome.

Some supporters of the antinatalist position assert that antinatalist policies could solve problems such as overpopulation, famine,[REF] and depletion of non-renewable resources [REF]. Some countries, such as India and China, have policies aimed at reducing the number of children per family, in an effort to curb serious overpopulation concerns and heavy strain on national resources, although these policies cannot be interpreted as discouraging all birth in general [REF]. Paul Ehrlich, in his book The Population Bomb, argued that rapidly increasing population would soon create a crisis, and advocated coercive antinatalist policies on a global level in order to avert a Malthusian catastrophe. Although no crisis occurred in the timeframe he expected (his predictions, coming in 1968, anticipated disaster by the late eighties), he stands by the book and maintains that without future depopulation efforts the problem will worsen [REF]. 

Other proponents of antinatalism appeal to ethics; David Benatar, for example, argues from the hedonistic premise that the infliction of harm is morally wrong and to be avoided. He argues that the birth of a new person always entails nontrivial harm to that person, and therefore there is a moral imperative not to procreate [REF].

Criticism of antinatalism may come from views that hold value in bringing potential future persons into existence, but there are also views holding that there is no such obligation [REF]. .
