In [[Greek mythology]], '''Silenus''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] Σειληνός) was a companion and [[tutor]] to the [[wine]] [[Greek god|god]] [[Dionysus]].  . 

==Evolution of the character==. 
The original Silenus resembled a [[folklore]] man of the forest with the ears of a horse and sometimes also the tail and legs of a horse. <ref>The Oxford Classical Dictionary</ref> The later Sileni were drunken followers of Dionysus, usually bald and  fat with thick lips and squat noses, and having the legs of a human. Later still, the plural "Sileni" went out of use and the only references were to one individual named Silenus, the teacher and faithful companion of the wine-god Dionysus. <ref>Kerenyi, p. 177. </ref> . 

A notorious consumer of wine, he was usually drunk and had to be supported by [[satyr]]s or carried by a [[donkey]]. Silenus was described as the oldest, wisest and most drunken of the followers of Dionysus, and was said in [[Orphic]] hymns to be the young god's tutor. This puts him in a company of phallic or half-animal tutors of the gods, a group that includes [[Priapus]], [[Hermaphroditus]], [[Cedalion]] and [[Chiron]], but also includes [[Pallas (son of Lycaon)|Pallas]], the tutor of [[Athena]]. <ref>Kerenyi, p. 177. </ref> . 

When intoxicated, Silenus was said to possess special knowledge and the power of prophecy. The Phrygian [[Midas|King Midas]] was eager to learn from Silenus and caught the old man by lacing a fountain from which Silenus often drank. As Silenus fell asleep, the king's servants seized and took him to their master.  .

Silenus shared with the king a pessimistic philosophy: ''That the best thing for a man is not to be born, and if already born, to die as soon as possible''. <ref>{{cite web |author=Plutarch |title=Consolation to Apollonius |work=The Morals, vol. 1 |publisher=Online Library of Liberty |date=1878 translation |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1211&chapter=91420&layout=html&Itemid=27 |accessdate=October 6, 2009}} (See section 27.)</ref> . 

An alternative story was that when lost and wandering in [[Phrygia]], Silenus was rescued by peasants and taken to [[Midas|King Midas]], who treated him kindly. In return for Midas' hospitality Silenus told him some tales and Midas, enchanted by Silenus’s fictions, entertained him for five days and nights. <ref>Thompson, J. [http://www.mythopoetry.com/mythopoetics/scholar09_thompson.html 'Emotional Intelligence/Imaginal Intelligence'] in Mythopoetry Scolar Journal, Vol 1, 2010</ref>  Dionysus offered Midas a reward for his kindness towards Silenus, and Midas chose the power of turning everything he touched into [[gold]]. Another story was that Silenus had been captured by two shepherds, and regaled them with wondrous tales.  . 

In [[Euripides]]'s [[satyr play]] ''[[Cyclops (play)|Cyclops]]'', Silenus is stranded with the Satyrs in [[Sicily]], where they have been [[Slavery|enslaved]] by the [[Cyclops]]. They are the comic elements of the story, which is basically a play on  [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' IX. Silenus refers to the satyrs as his children during the play. Silenus also appears in [[Emperor Julian the Apostate]]'s satire, ''The Caesars'', where he sits next to the gods and offers up his comments on the various rulers under examination. He essentially serves as Julian's voice of critique for Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Augustus, Marcus Aurelius (whom he reveres as a fellow philosopher-king), and Constantine I. <ref>[http://www.mountainman.com.au/essenes/Julian_Caesares_Symposium_Kronia.htm ''The Caesars'' on-line English translation]. </ref> . 

[[Image:Head of Silenus - Project Gutenberg eText 19115.png|thumb|A ''poinçon'' bearing the head of Silenus in relief, discovered in Roman strata at Holt, Cheshire, is believed to be an artist's die, from which potters' sunk dies would be cast, for appliqués]] . 

Silenus was also possibly a [[Latin]] term of abuse around 211 BC, being used in [[Plautus]]' ''[[Rudens]]'' to describe Labrax, a treacherous [[pimp]] or ''leno'', as "...a pot-bellied old Silenus, bald head, beefy, bushy eyebrows, scowling, twister, god-forsaken criminal"<ref>Plautus</ref>.  . 

==In art==. 
Silenus commonly figures in Roman bas-reliefs of the train of Dionysus, a subject for [[Sarcophagus|sarcophagi]], embodying the transcendent promises of Dionysian cult. The figure reappears with the [[Renaissance]]: a [[court dwarf]] posed for the Silenus-like figure astride a tortoise at the entrance to the [[Boboli Gardens]], Florence. [[:Image:Rubens Der trunkene Silen.jpg|''The Drunken Silenus'']], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], painted in 1616-17 is conserved in the [[Alte Pinakothek]], Munich.

==In later literature and art== . 

[[Carl Linnaeus]] used the feminine form ''[[Silene]]'' as the name of a genus of flowering plant. <ref>Umberto Quattrocchi, ''CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names'', 1999, ISBN 0-8493-2678-8, '''4''':2482</ref> . 

Silenus appears in the writings of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], who endorsed his most famous dictum that "the best thing for a man is not to be born". Via Schopenhauer, Nietzsche discusses the "wisdom of Silenus" in ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]''.  . 

During late 19th century Germany and [[Vienna Secession|Vienna]], symbolism from ancient Greece was reinterpreted through a new [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] prism. Around the same time [[Vienna Secession]] artist [[Gustav Klimt]] uses the irreverent, chubby-faced Silenus as a motif in several works to represent "buried instinctual forces". <ref>[[Carl Emil Schorske|Carl Schorske]] ''[[Fin-de-Siècle Vienna|Fin-de-Siècle Vienna - Politics and Culture]]'', 1980, page 221</ref> . 

In 1884 [[Thomas Woolner]] published a long narrative poem about Silenus. In [[Oscar Wilde]]'s 1890 novel ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'', Lord Henry Wooton turns praise of folly into a philosophy which mocks "slow Silenus" for being sober.  . 

In [[Brian Hooker (poet)|Brian Hooker]] 's 1923 English translation of [[Edmond Rostand]]'s ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'', Cyrano disparagingly refers to the ham actor Montfleury as "That Silenus who cannot hold his belly in his arms." . 

Silenus is a character, along with [[Dionysus|Bacchus]], in the [[C.S. Lewis]] fantasy novel ''[[Prince Caspian]]'', the second book (or fourth, depending on the order they are arranged) in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' series.  . 

In the [[Percy Jackson]] series written by [[Rick Riordan]], Silenus is a satyr who dies during the battle against [[Cronus]].  . 

Martin Silenus is the satyr-like and alcohol-appreciating poet-pilgrim in American writer [[Dan Simmons]]' ''[[Hyperion Cantos]]''.  . 

Silenus appears as an amorous satyr in the children's story "Odysseus in the Serpent Maze," by [[Jane Yolen]] and Robert J. Harris.  . 

Professor Silenus is a Character from Evelyn Waugh's first novel, [[Decline and Fall]]. He features as the disaffected architect of King's Thursday and provides the Novel with one of its primary motifs. In the prophetic style of the traditional greek Silenus he informs the protagonist that life is , "a great disc of polished wood that revolves quickly. At first you sit down and watch the others. They are all trying to sit in the wheel, and they keep getting flung off, and that makes them laugh, and you laugh too. It's great fun . . . Of course at the very centre there's a point completely at rest, if one could only find it. . . . Lots of people just enjoy scrambling on and being whisked off and scrambling on again. . . . But the whole point about the wheel is that you needn't get on it at all. . . . People get hold of ideas about life, and that makes them think they've got to join in the game, even if they don't enjoy it. It doesn't suit everyone . . ."<ref>Through Comedy toward Catholicism: A Reading of Evelyn Waugh's Early Novels, Michael Gorra, Contemporary Literature, Vol. 29, No. 2 (Summer, 1988), pp. 201-220 http://www.jstor.org/pss/1208437</ref> .
