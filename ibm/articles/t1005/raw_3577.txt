The '''Greensboro massacre''' occurred on November 3, 1979 in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], United States. Five protest marchers were shot and killed by members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and the [[American Nazi Party]]. The protest was the culmination of attempts by the [[Communist Workers Party (US)|Communist Workers Party]] to organize mostly black industrial workers in the area. <ref name="democracy"/>  .

==Rally==. 
Hostility between the groups flared in July 1979 when protesters disrupted a screening of the 1915 epic, ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' directed by [[D. W. Griffith]], a cinematographic portrayal of the formation of a [[Ku Klux Klan]]. Taunts and inflammatory rhetoric were exchanged during the ensuing months. On November 3, 1979 a rally and march of industrial workers and Communists was planned in Greensboro against the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. The ''Death to the Klan March'' was to begin in a predominantly black housing project called Morningside Homes.  Communist organizers publicly challenged the Klan to present themselves and "face the wrath of the people". <ref name="chronology">{{cite web | title= Chronology of the November 3, 1979 Greensboro Massacre and its Aftermath | url=http://www.ibiblio.org/prism/jan98/chron.html | publisher=The Prism | accessdate = 2007-09-27}}</ref> During the rally, a caravan of cars containing Klansmen and members of the [[American Nazi Party]] drove by the housing projects where the Communists and other anti-Klan activists were congregating. Several marchers began to attack the Klansmens' cars with small wooden sticks or by throwing rocks. According to white supremacist Frazier Glenn Miller, the first shots were fired from a handgun by an anti-Klan demonstrator. <ref name="closure">{{cite news| author=F. Glenn Miller |title=A White Man Speaks Out  |url=http://whty.org/book/06.htm |date=2005-03-06 |accessdate=2010-08-25 }}</ref> However several witnesses reported Klansman Mark Sherer fired the first shot (into the air). <ref name="commission">{{cite web | title= Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission Final Report | url= http://www.greensborotrc.org/1979_sequence.pdf |accessdate = 2011-04-02}}</ref> Klansmen and Nazis fired with shotguns, rifles and pistols. Cauce, Waller and Sampson were killed at the scene.  Smith was shot in the forehead when she peeked from her hiding place. Eleven others were wounded. One of them, Dr. Michael Nathan, later died from his wounds at a hospital. <ref name="closure">{{cite news| author=Darryl Fears |title=Seeking Closure on 'Greensboro Massacre'  |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A10392-2005Mar5.html |work=Washington Post |date=2005-03-06 |accessdate=2007-09-27 }}</ref>  Most of the armed confrontation was filmed by four local news camera crews.  . 

===Role of the police===. 
One of the most questionable aspects of the shoot-out is the role of the police. Police would normally have been present at such a rally. However, no police were present, which allowed the assailants to escape. A police detective and a police photographer did follow the Klan and [[neo-Nazi]] caravan to the site, but did not attempt to intervene. Edward Dawson, a Klansmen turned police informant,<ref name="democracy"/> was in the lead car of the caravan. <ref name="closure"/> Two days prior to the march, one of the Klansmen went to the police station and obtained a map of the march and the rally. <ref name="chronology"/> Bernard Butkovich, an undercover agent for the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATFE) later testified that he was aware that Klansmen and members of the American Nazi Party unit he had infiltrated would confront the demonstrators. In a previous testimony, the neo-Nazis claimed the agent encouraged them to carry firearms to the anti-Klan demonstration. <ref name="agent">{{cite news|title=Agent Tells Of '79 Threats By Klan And Nazis  |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00D1EFA3E5F0C718DDDAC0894DD484D81&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fK%2fKu%20Klux%20Klan |work=The New York Times |date=1985-05-12 |accessdate=2007-09-27 }}</ref> .

Forty Klansmen and neo-Nazis, and several Communist marchers were involved in the shootings; sixteen Klansmen and Nazis were arrested and the six best cases were brought to trial first. <ref name="democracy">{{cite web | author = Mark Hand | title= The Greensboro Massacre | url=

===Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission===. 
In 2005, [http://www.gtcrp.org Greensboro residents], inspired by post-[[apartheid]] South Africa,{{citation needed|date = November 2011}} initiated a [[Truth and reconciliation commission|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] to take public testimony and examine the causes and consequences of the massacre; the efforts of the Commission were officially opposed by the Greensboro City Council.{{citation needed|date = November 2011}} . 

The Commission determined that Klan members went to the rally intending to provoke a violent confrontation, and that they fired on demonstrators. In addition, the Commission found that the violent rhetoric of the Communist Workers Party and the Klan contributed in varying degrees to the violence, and that the protesters had not fully secured the community support of the Morningside Homes residents, many of whom did not approve of the protest because of its potential for violent confrontation.{{citation needed|date = November 2011}} . 

The Commission also found that the Greensboro Police Department had infiltrated the Klan and, through a paid informant, knew of the white supremacists’ plans and the strong potential for violence.{{citation needed|date = November 2011}} The informant had formerly been on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's payroll but had maintained contact with his agent supervisor. Consequently, the FBI was also aware of the impending armed confrontation. <ref>{{cite journal |last=Bermanzohn |first=Sally Avery |title=A Massacre Survivor Reflects on the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission |journal=Radical History Review |issue=97 |page=103 |year=2007 |month=Winter |accessdate=2009-05-31 |quote= In sum, the GPD instigated and facilitated the attack with the knowledge of federal agents in the FBI and the ATF |url=http://rhr.dukejournals.org/cgi/reprint/2007/97/102}}</ref> . 

The Commission further established that some activists in the crowd fired back after they were attacked. <ref name="commission">{{cite web | title= Truth Commission Blames Cops in ‘Greensboro Massacre’ | url=

==Trivia==. 
The British band [[Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark]] wrote the track "88 Seconds in Greensboro" about the incident.  It was on their album ''[[Crush (OMD album)|Crush]]'' and was the [[B-side]] for the UK version of the single for "[[If You Leave]]".  . 

Another British band, [[Pop Will Eat Itself]], has a track called "88 Seconds... & Still Counting", from their 1990 album ''[[Cure For Sanity]]'', which also mentions the incident.  . 

Greensboro band [http://theothermothers.com The Othermothers] featured a track about the incident, "88 Seconds (I Wanna Go To The Rodeo)" on their 1985 EP "No Place Like Home".  .
