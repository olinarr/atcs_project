{{Apartheid}} . 

The '''Truth and Reconciliation Commission''' (TRC) was a court-like [[restorative justice]]<ref>Suffolk University, College of Arts & Sciences, Center for Restorative Justice, [http://www.suffolk.edu/research/6953.html What is Restorative Justice?]</ref> body assembled in [[South Africa]] after the abolition of [[apartheid]].  Witnesses who were identified as victims of gross human rights violations were invited to give statements about their experiences, and some were selected for public hearings. Perpetrators of violence could also give testimony and request [[amnesty]] from both civil and criminal prosecution.  . 

The TRC, the first of the nineteen held internationally to stage public hearings, was seen by many as a crucial component of the [[Transitional justice|transition]] to full and free [[democracy]] in South Africa.  Despite some flaws, it is generally (although not universally) thought to have been successful. <ref>[http://ictj.org/publication/truth-telling-identities-and-power-south-africa-and-guatemala "Truth Telling, Identities, and Power in South Africa and Guatemala"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''</ref> . 

==Creation and mandate==. 
The TRC was set up in terms of the ''Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act'', No. 34 of 1995, and was based in [[Cape Town]].  The mandate of the commission was to bear witness to, record and in some cases grant amnesty to the perpetrators of crimes relating to human rights violations, as well as reparation and rehabilitation.  The TRC had a number of high profile members: [[Archbishop]] [[Desmond Tutu]] (chairman), Dr. [[Alex Boraine]] (Deputy Chairman), [[Mary Burton]], [[Advocate]] [[Chris de Jager]], [[Bongani Finca]], [[Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela]], [[Sisi Khampepe]], Richard Lyster<!-- NB: If you want to wikilink Richard Lyster, please ensure that the article you link to is not about Sir Richard Earl Lyster (c.1480 – 14 March 1554) :-) --Djmackenzie, 24 April 2009 -->, [[Wynand Malan]], [[Reverend]] [[Khoza Mgojo]], [[Hlengiwe Mkhize]], [[Dumisa Ntsebeza]] (head of the Investigative Unit), Dr. Wendy Orr, Advocate [[Denzil Potgieter]], [[Mapule Ramashala]], Dr. [[Fazel Randera]], [[Yasmin Sooka]] and [[Glenda Wildschut]].  . 

==Committees==. 
The work of the TRC was accomplished through three committees: . 

*The Human Rights Violations Committee investigated human rights abuses that occurred between 1960 and 1994. 
*The Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee was charged with restoring victims' dignity and formulating proposals to assist with rehabilitation. 
*The Amnesty Committee considered applications from individuals who applied for amnesty in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  . 

Public hearings of the Human Rights Violations Committee and the Amnesty Committee were held at many venues around South Africa, including Cape Town (at the University of the Western Cape), Johannesburg (at the Central Methodist Mission), and Randburg (at the Rhema Bible Church).  . 

The commission was empowered to grant [[amnesty]] to those who committed abuses during the apartheid era, as long as the crimes were politically motivated, proportionate, and there was full disclosure by the person seeking amnesty.  . 

To avoid [[victor's justice]], no side was exempt from appearing before the commission. The commission heard reports of human rights violations and considered amnesty applications from all sides, from the apartheid state to the liberation forces, including the [[African National Congress]].  . 

A total of 5,392 amnesty applications were refused, granting only 849 out of the 7,112 (which includes the number of additional categories, such as ''withdrawn''). <ref>Department of Justice and Constitutional Development of the Republic of South Africa, The Truth and Reconciliation Official Website, available at http://www.justice.gov.za/trc/amntrans/index.htm [last accessed 02 October 2001]. </ref> . 

==Impact==. 
The TRC's emphasis on reconciliation is in sharp contrast to the approach taken by the [[Nuremberg Trials]] after World War II and other de-Nazification measures.  Because of the perceived success{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} of the reconciliatory approach in dealing with human-rights violations after political change either from internal or external factors, other countries have instituted similar commissions, though not always with the same scope or the allowance for charging those currently in power.  The success of the "TRC method" versus the "Nuremberg method" of prosecution is open for debate.  . 

In a survey study by Jay and Erika Vora, the effectiveness of the TRC Commission was measured on a variety of levels, namely its usefulness in terms of bringing out the truth of what had happened during the apartheid regime, the feelings of reconciliation that could be linked to the Commission, and the positive effects both domestically and internationally that the Commission brought about in a variety of ways from the political environment of South Africa to the economic one.  The opinions of three ethnic groups were measured in this study: the [[Anglo-African|English]], the [[Afrikaners]], and the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]]. <ref name=vora>Vora, Jay A. and Erika Vora. 2004. "The Effectiveness of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission: Perceptions of Xhosa, Afrikaner, and English South Africans." ''Journal of Black Studies'' 34.3: 301-322. 
</ref> . 

The effectiveness of the Commission in bringing out truth can be viewed in the following statement from an article by Jay and Erika Vora: . 

<blockquote>
All participants perceived the TRC to be effective in bringing out the truth, however, in varying degrees. The Afrikaners perceived the TRC to be less effective in bringing out the truth than the English participants and much less effective than did the Xhosa... <ref name="vora"/>
</blockquote> . 

The differences in opinions about the effectiveness can be attributed to how each group viewed the proceedings.  Some viewed them as not entirely accurate as many people would lie in order to keep themselves out of trouble while receiving amnesty for their crimes, given that the Commission would grant amnesty to some with consideration given to the weight of the crimes committed.  . 

The TRC was viewed as much less effective in bringing about reconciliation by each group, with the two white groups about par and the Xhosa viewing the TRC as less effective than the other two ethnic groups.  Some said that the proceedings only helped to remind them of the horrors that had taken place in the past when they had been working to forget such things.  Thus, the TRC's effectiveness in terms of achieving those very things within its title is still debatable. <ref name="vora"/> . 

==Media coverage==. 
The hearings were initially set to be heard ''[[in camera]]'', but the intervention of 23 non-governmental organisations eventually succeeded in gaining media access to the hearings. On 15 April 1996 the South African National Broadcaster televised the first two hours of the first human rights violation committee hearing live. With funding from the Norwegian government, radio continued to broadcast live throughout. Additional high-profile hearings, such as Winnie Mandela's testimony, were also televised live. The rest of the hearings were presented on television each Sunday from April 1996 to June 1998 in hour-long episodes of the "Truth Commission Special Report" by progressive Afrikaner journalist [[Max du Preez]], former editor of the [[Vrye Weekblad]]. <ref>[http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reports/98-4NRwint98/Thloloe.html ]{{Dead link|date=September 2009}}</ref>  The producers of the program included Anneliese Burgess, Jann Turner, Benedict Motau, Gael Reagon, Rene Schiebe and Bronwyn Nicholson, a production assistant. <ref>[http://www.jannturner.co.za/films.php ]{{Dead link|date=September 2009}}</ref> . 

Various films have been made about the commission:
*''[[Confronting the Truth]]'' by [[Steve York]]. 2006, documentary, produced in association with the [[United States Institute of Peace]]. 
*''[[Facing the Truth (PBS series)|Facing the Truth]]'' (1999) by [[Bill Moyers]]. 2-part PBS series. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/pov/tvraceinitiative/facingthetruth/ |title=Facing the Truth |publisher=Pbs.org |date=1999-03-30 |accessdate=2009-09-19}}</ref>
*''[[Forgiveness (2004 film)|Forgiveness]]'' (2004) directed by Ian Gabriel. A South African feature film starring South African–born actor [[Arnold Vosloo]] as a disgraced ex-cop seeking forgiveness from the family of the activist he killed under the Apartheid regime. With Quanita Adams and Zane Meas. 
*''[[In My Country]]'' (2004), very loosely based on ''[[Country of My Skull]]'', an autobiographical text by [[Antjie Krog]] which dealt with her coverage of the hearings, starring [[Samuel L. Jackson]] and [[Juliette Binoche]]
*''[[Long Night's Journey into Day]]'' (2000) by [[Frances Reid]]. Documentary. <ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0236447/ Long Night's Journey into Day]</ref>
*''[[Red Dust (2004 film)|Red Dust]]'' (2004), based on the novel of the same title by Gillian Slovo, starring [[Hilary Swank]], Jamie Bartlett and [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]]
*''[[Zulu Love Letter]]'' (2004) directed by Ramadan Suleman and starring Pamela Nomvete.  . 

Several plays have been produced about the TRC:
*"[[Truth in Translation]]" (2006), by Paavo Tom Tammi, in collaboration with  American director, [[Michael Lessac]] and the company of Colonnades Theatre Lab, South Africa. 
*''[[Ubu and the Truth Commission]]'' (1997), by Jane Taylor and [[William Kentridge]]. 
*''Nothing but the Truth'' (2002), by [[John Kani]]
*''[[The Story I Am About to Tell]]'', created in collaboration with the Khulumani support group
*''[[The Dead Wait]]'', by [[Paul Herzberg]] . 

Some of Ingrid de Kok's poetry in ''Terrestrial Things'' (2002) deals with the TRC (e.g. The Archbishop Chairs the First Session, The Transcriber Speaks, The Sound Engineer).  . 

==Criticisms==. 
A 1998 study by South Africa's Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation & the Khulumani Support Group,<ref name=csvr>{{cite web|url=http://www.csvr.org.za/papers/papkhul.htm|title=Survivors' Perceptions of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and Suggestions for the Final Report|publisher=Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation|accessdate=2006-12-26 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060925181412/http://www.csvr.org.za/papers/papkhul.htm |archivedate = September 25, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.khulumani.net/home.html |title=Home &#124; South, Pdf, Litigation, Apartheid, Khulum |publisher=Khulumani |date= |accessdate=2009-09-19| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080521103450/http://www.khulumani.net/home.html| archivedate = May 21, 2008}}</ref> which surveyed several hundred victims of human-rights abuse during the Apartheid era, found that most felt that the TRC had failed to achieve reconciliation between the black and white communities.  Most believed that justice was a prerequisite for reconciliation rather than an alternative to it, and that the TRC had been weighted in favour of the perpetrators of abuse. <ref name=storey>{{cite journal|title=A Different Kind of Justice: Truth and Reconciliation in South Africa
|first=Peter |last=Storey |url=http://gbgm-umc.org/NWO/99ja/different.html|journal=The Christian Century|date=September 10–17, 1997| accessdate=2006-12-26}}</ref><ref>As [[William Kentridge]], director of ''Ubu and the Truth Commission'', put it, "A full confession can bring [[amnesty]] and immunity from prosecution or civil procedures for the crimes committed.  Therein lies the central irony of the Commission.  As people give more and more evidence of the things they have done they get closer and closer to amnesty and it gets more and more intolerable that these people should be given amnesty." (Kentridge 2007, p. viii)</ref> . 

Another dilemma facing the TRC was how to do justice to the testimonials of those witnesses for whom translation was necessary.  It was believed that, with the great discrepancy between the emotions of the witnesses and those translating them, much of the impact was lost in interlingual rendition.  A briefly tried solution was to have the translators mimic the witnesses' emotions, but this proved disastrous and was quickly scrapped. <ref>Kentridge 2007, p. xiv. </ref> . 

While former president [[F.W. de Klerk]] appeared before the commission and reiterated his apology for the suffering caused by apartheid, many black South Africans were angered at amnesty being granted for human rights abuses committed by the apartheid government.  The BBC described such criticisms as stemming from a "basic misunderstanding" about the TRC's mandate,<ref name=bbc>{{cite news|first=Greg |last=Barrow|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1998/10/98/truth_and_reconciliation/142673.stm|title=South Africans reconciled? Special Report|date=30 October 1998|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2006-12-26}}</ref> which was to uncover the truth about past abuse, using amnesty as a mechanism, rather than to punish past crimes.  . 

Among the highest-profile of these objections were the criticisms levelled by the family of prominent anti-apartheid activist [[Steve Biko]], who was killed by the security police, and whose story was later featured in the film ''[[Cry Freedom]]''. <ref name=biko>{{cite web|url=http://sahistory.org.za/pages/people/biko,s.htm|title=Stephen Bantu Biko|publisher=South African History Online|accessdate=2006-12-26| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060924120312/http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/people/biko,s.htm| archivedate = September 24, 2006}}</ref>  Biko's family described the TRC as a "vehicle for political expediency", which "robbed" them of their right to justice. <ref name=Biko>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19970911/ai_n14132136|title=Apartheid enforcer sticks to 'farcical' story on Biko killing|publisher=Findarticles.com|accessdate=2007-10-24| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071110010302/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19970911/ai_n14132136| archivedate = November 10, 2007}}</ref>  The family opposed amnesty for his killers on these grounds and brought a legal action in South Africa's highest court, arguing that the TRC was unconstitutional.  . 

On the other side of the spectrum, former apartheid [[State President of South Africa|State President]] [[P.W. Botha]] defied a subpoena to appear before the commission, calling it a "circus".  His defiance resulted in a fine and suspended sentence, but these were overturned on appeal. <ref name=pwbotha>{{cite web|url=http://africanhistory.about.com/od/biography/a/BioPWBotha_3.htm|title=PW Botha - A Biography|first=Alistair|last=Boddy-Evans|publisher=About.com|accessdate=2006-12-26}}</ref> . 

Playwright Jane Taylor, responsible for the acclaimed ''[[Ubu and the Truth Commission]]'', found fault with the Commission's lopsided influence: . 

<blockquote>The TRC is unquestionably a monumental process, the consequences of which will take years to unravel.  For all its pervasive weight, however, it infiltrates our culture asymmetrically, unevenly across multiple sectors. Its place in small rural communities, for example, when it establishes itself in a local church hall, and absorbs substantial numbers of the population, is very different from its situation in large urban centres, where its presence is marginalised by other social and economic activities. <ref>Taylor 2007, p. v. </ref></blockquote> . 

[[John Pilger]], an internationally significant journalist, castigates the Truth and Reconciliation Commission for allowing the easy transition from white exclusive capitalism to multiracial capitalism, and for failing to cause the trial of criminals, particularly murderers. <ref>John Pilger 1998, ''Apartheid did not die'' (television programme), [http://www.johnpilger.com/videos/apartheid-did-not-die Johnpiler.com], footage prior to 18:00. </ref> .
