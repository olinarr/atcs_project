'''Memorialization''' generally refers to the process of preserving memories of people or events. It can be a form of address or petition, or a ceremony of remembrance. <ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/memorialization "Memorialize"], ''Merriam Webster Dictionary''</ref>  . 

==Memorialization as a Human Right==. 
Memorialization is a universal need for both those being memorialized and those who are grieving. Although historically it was limited to the elite and only practiced in the highest societal classes, it is now considered a fundamental [[human right]] for all people. <ref>[http://www.memorialized.com/ ''Memorialized.com'']</ref>  . 

==Memorialization and Transitional Justice==. 
In the context of [[transitional justice]], memorialization is used to honor the victims of  human rights abuses.   Memorials can help governments reconcile tensions with victims by demonstrating respect and acknowledging the past. They can also help to establish a record of history, and to  prevent the recurrence of abuse. <ref>[http://ictj.org/our-work/transitional-justice-issues/truth-and-memory "Truth and Memory"], ''[[International Center for Transitional Justice]] (ICTJ)''</ref>   . 

Memorials can also be serious social and political forces in democracy-building efforts. <ref>[http://ictj.org/publication/memorialization-and-democracy-state-policy-and-civic-action "Memorialization and Democracy: State Policy and Civic Action"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ)''</ref>   . 

Memorials are also a form of [[Reparations (transitional justice)|reparations]], or compensation efforts that seek to address past [[human rights violations]]. They aim to provide compensation for losses endured by victims of abuse, and remedy prior wrongdoing. They also publicly recognize that victims’ are entitled to redress and respect. The [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/remedy.htm United Nations Basic Principles on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation] recognizes “commemorations and tributes to the victims” as a form of reparation. <ref>[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/remedy.htm], ''Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights''</ref>    . 

There are numerous  types of memorials used as [[transitional justice]] initiatives. These include architectural memorials, museums, and other commemorative events.  For instance, in northern [[Uganda]], monuments, annual prayer ceremonies, and a mass grave were created in response to the war conducted by and against the [[Lord’s Resistance Army]] there. <ref>[http://ictj.org/publication/we-can%E2%80%99t-be-sure-who-killed-us-memory-and-memorialization-post-conflict-northern-uganda "We Can’t Be Sure Who Killed Us: Memory and Memorialization in Post-conflict Northern Uganda"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ)''</ref>   . 

Another example is the Museum of Memory and Human Rights in [[Chile]], which was created to document abuses by the former [[military dictatorship]] there. <ref>[http://www.museodelamemoria.cl/ MUSEO DE LA MEMORIA Y LOS DERECHOS HUMANOS]</ref> . 

==Challenges of Memorialization==. 
Memorialization can arouse controversy and present certain risks. In unstable political situations, memorials may increase desire for revenge and catalyze further violence. They are highly politicized processes that represent the will of those in power. They are thus difficult to shape, and international relief workers, [[peacekeepers]], and [[NGOs]] risk being drawn into disputes about the creation or maintenance of memorial sites. Yet they also have the potential to redress historical grievances and enable societies to progress. <ref>[http://www.usip.org/publications/urge-remember-role-memorials-social-reconstruction-and-transitional-justice "The Urge to Remember: The Role of Memorials in Social Reconstruction and Transitional Justice"]''United States Institute of Peace''</ref> .
