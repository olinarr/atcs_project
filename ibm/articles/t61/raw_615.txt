'''Cheating at the Paralympic Games''' has caused scandals that have significantly changed the way in which the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) manages the events. Testing for [[doping (sport)|performance-enhancing drugs]] has become increasingly strict and more widespread throughout the Games, with [[powerlifting]] seeing the most positive results. Competitors without disabilities have also competed in some [[Paralympic Games]], with the [[Spain at the Paralympic Games|Spanish entry]] in the intellectually disabled [[basketball]] tournament at the [[2000 Summer Paralympics]] being the most controversial.  . 

==Doping==.

Some [[professional sports|professional]] and [[amateur sports|amateur]] sporting competitions randomly sample athletes to eliminate the use of [[doping (sport)|performance-enhancing drugs]], and the Paralympic Games are no different. The first positive results came in the [[1992 Summer Paralympics|1992 Barcelona Games]] with five athletes found to have used banned substances. <ref name="AccessAu">Korte, Tim. 7 March 2002. "[http://www.accessibility.com.au/news/sport/para_cheat.htm Cheating Plagues Paralympic Athletes]". Accessed 15 August 2007. </ref> The 2000 Sydney Games saw fourteen athletes return a positive test, ten of which were in the [[powerlifting]] competition. <ref name="EuroVance">Vance, Nicki. [[European Paralympic Committee]]. "[http://www.europaralympic.org/doping/dossier/dossier_doping_control.htm Doping control at the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games]. Accessed 15 August 2007. </ref> . 

The Sydney 2000 Doping Control Program had the responsibility of ensuring that the games met the International Paralympic Medical and Anti-Doping Code and, for the first time in the sport, out-of-competition (OOC) testing was introduced. This meant that the testing window was much wider, with any competitor being called for a test at any point throughout the Games.  . 

Nine powerlifters returned positive results before the competition and were promptly ejected. One further powerlifter and an athlete gave positive results after winning medals. <ref name="EuroVance" /> . 

In the [[2002 Winter Paralympics|Salt Lake City Winter Paralympics]] in 2002 German cross country skier [[Thomas Oelsner]] gave a positive result after winning two gold medals. He was suspended for two years from all IPC events. <ref name="SaltLakeOelsner">Maffly, Bryan. ''The Salt Lake Tribune''. 13 March 2002.

==Intellectual disability==.

===Basketball controversy===. 
The 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney, which had already seen controversy with numerous positive drug tests, would be the venue for one of the most scandalous events in the sport's history. Spain was stripped of their intellectual disability [[basketball]] gold medals shortly after the Games closed<ref name="BBC141200">[[BBC News]]. 14 December 2000. "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1071059.stm Spain ordered to return golds]". Accessed 14 August 2007</ref> after Carlos Ribagorda, a member of the victorious team and an undercover journalist, revealed to the Spanish business magazine ''Capital'' that most of his colleagues had not undergone medical tests to ensure that they had a disability.  The IPC investigated the claims and found that the required mental tests, which should show that the competitors have an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]] of no more than 70,<ref name="CNNSI">[[Rick Reilly|Reilly, Rick]]. ''[[CNN Sports Illustrated]]''. 5 December 2000. "[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/magazine/life_of_reilly/news/2000/12/05/life_of_reilly/ Paralympic Paradox]". Accessed 14 August 2007. </ref> were not conducted by the Spanish Paralympic Committee (CPE). Ribagorda alleged that some Spanish participants in the [[table tennis]], [[track and field]], and [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] events were also not disabled, meaning that five medals had been won fraudulently. <ref name="CNNSI" /><ref name="CBC">''CBC Sports''. 30 November 2000. "[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2000/11/30/para001130.html Spanish Paralympic exec resigns amid scandal]". Accessed 14 August 2007. </ref>  . 

He went on to say that the Spanish Federation for Mentally Handicapped Sports (FEDDI) deliberately chose to sign up athletes who were not intellectually disabled to "win medals and gain more sponsorship". <ref name="BBC241100">[[BBC News]]. 24 November 2000. "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1039129.stm Spain in Paralympics scandal]". Accessed 14 August 2007. </ref> Fernando Martin Vicente, president of the FEDDI and vice-president of CPE, initially denied the allegations. <ref name="BBC241100" /> After it was confirmed that 10 of the 12 competitors in the winning team were not disabled,<ref name="BBC141200" /> Martin Vicente publicly apologised for the error and accepted total responsibility, resigning just before the findings were officially released. <ref name="CBC" />  . 

Two weeks later the team was officially disqualified and was ordered to return the gold medals. <ref name="BBC141200" /> The controversy has been cited as one of the "most outrageous sporting moments" in history. <ref name="30outrage">''Observer Sport Monthly''. 31 October 2004. "[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1337336,00.html The 30 most outrageous sporting moments, part 2]". Accessed 14 August 2007. </ref> . 

===IPC reaction===. 
{{Out of date|section|date=November 2010}}
The IPC announced that, due to serious difficulties in determining the eligibility of athletes, it was suspending all official sporting activities involving an intellectual disability. <ref name="NYT">''[[The New York Times]]''. 30 January 2001. "[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9F06E4DB1E3FF933A05752C0A9679C8B63&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fP%2fParalympic%20Games  PLUS: PARALYMPICS; Paralympic Group Orders Suspensions]".

Following an anti-corruption drive, the International Sports Federation for Persons with an Intellectual Disability (INAS-FID) lobbied to have these athletes reinstated. Beginning in 2004, athletes with an intellectual disability began to be re-integrated into Paralympic sport competitions, although they remain excluded from the Paralympic Games.
