{{see also|Prohibition (drugs)}}
'''Drug prohibition law''' is [[Prohibitionist|prohibition-based]] [[law]] by which [[government]]s prohibit, except under [[licence]], the production, supply, and possession of many, but not all, substances which are recognised as [[drug]]s, and which corresponds to international [[treaty]] commitments in the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961]]<ref>[http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/single-convention.html ''Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961'', United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) website, accessed 6 February 2009]</ref>, the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances 1971]]<ref>[http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/psychotropics.html ''Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971'', United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) website, accessed 6 February 2009]</ref>, and the [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances 1988]]<ref>[http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/illicit-trafficking.html ''Convention against the Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988'', United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) website, accessed 6 February 2009]</ref>.  . 

When produced, supplied or possessed under licence, otherwise prohibited drugs are known as controlled drugs. The aforementioned legislation is the [[cultural]] [[institution]] and [[social fact]] that de facto divides world [[drug trade]] as illegal vs [[legal drug trade|legal]], according to [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] issues.  . 

The [[United Nations]] has its own [[United Nations International Drug Control Programme|drug control programme]], as part of the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC)<ref>[http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/about-unodc/index.html ''About UNODC'', United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime website, accessed 9 February 2009]</ref>, which was formerly called the United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention (ODCCP), and the [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]]<ref>[http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/commissions/CND/index.html ''The Commission on Narcotic Drugs'', United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime website, accessed 13 February 2009]</ref> is the central drug policy-making body within the United Nations system.  . 

The [[International Narcotics Control Board]] (INCB)<ref>[http://www.incb.org/ International Narcotics Control Board website, accessed 13 February 2009]</ref> is an independent and [[quasi-judicial]] control organ for the implementation of the United Nations drug control conventions.  . 

It is important to note that there are several different sets of "schedules", or lists, of controlled drugs.  One is the INCB [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Schedules of drugs|schedules]] (four schedules numbered I-IV), while another is the United States' [[Controlled Substances Act]] [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedules of controlled substances|schedules of controlled substances]] (five schedules, numbered I-V). Other countries also have different classifications and numbers of lists, such as those of the [[Controlled Drug|United Kingdom]] and [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act|Canada]].  . 

== History and founding principles ==. 
{{Expand section|date=February 2009}} . 

Drug prohibition law is based on the view that some drugs, notably [[opium poppy]], [[coca]], and substances derived from these [[plant]]s, are so [[Substance dependence|addictive]] or dependence inducing and so dangerous, in terms of potential effects on the [[health]], [[morality]] and [[behaviour]] of users, that they should be rarely, if ever, used.  . 

[[Psychotropic substances]] covered by drug control law include [[psilocybin mushrooms]] and [[lysergic acid diethylamide]] (LSD).  . 

The following treaties are no longer in force, being superseded in 1961 by the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]]: . 

* [[International Opium Convention]], signed at [[The Hague]] on 23 January 1912
* [[Agreement concerning the Manufacture of, Internal Trade in and Use of Prepared Opium]], signed at [[Geneva]] on 11 February 1925
* [[Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs]], signed at Geneva on 13 July 1931
* [[Agreement for the Control of Opium Smoking in the Far East]], signed at [[Bangkok]] on 27 November 1931 . 

== Licensing == . 

Otherwise prohibited drugs may be licensed for medical, research and industrial purposes.  . 

[[Pharmaceutical companies]], also known as drug companies, work under drug control licenses.  . 

[[Hemp]] production from [[cannabis]] is an example of an industrial purpose.  . 

== Recreational and self-medicational drug use == . 

[[Recreational drug use|Recreational use]] and [[Self-medication|self-medicational use]] are not licensed under drug prohibition laws, although other drugs, not covered by such laws, may be legally available for this purpose. [[Alcohol]] and [[tobacco]] are notable examples of legally available recreational drugs. [[Aspirin]] is an example of a drug legally available for self-medicational purposes.  . 

Health, moral, and behavior issues, and legal issues, are associated with alcohol and tobacco use, but these are not addressed through drug prohibition laws.  . 

Addiction to a prohibited drug may not be considered a legitimate reason for using it, even if the drug is obtained from a licensed source, or a substitute may be provided, for example, [[methadone]] instead of [[heroin]]. Generally, however, those addicted to prohibited drugs are expected to find other ways of coping with their addictions, or to risk suffering the law enforcement penalties associated with illegal possession.  . 

== Enforcement == . 

There is an extensive illegal trans-national industry supplying prohibited drugs for recreational use {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. Thus, while drug prohibition laws remain in force, there is perpetual law enforcement action directed against the illegal industry, which also impacts supply for self-medication.  . 

Although it is directed against illegal recreational drugs, and not against drugs licensed under prohibition laws or against drugs beyond the scope of prohibition laws, the law enforcement is sometimes called the ''[[war on drugs]]''.  .

In the [[United Kingdom]], where the principal piece of drug prohibition legislation is the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]]<ref name="UK 1">[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/legResults.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=The+Misuse+of+Drugs+Act+1971&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&TYPE=QS&NavFrom=0&activeTextDocId=1367412&PageNumber=1&SortAlpha=0 ''Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (c.38)'', the text of the act, OPSI website, accessed 27 January 2009]</ref>, criticism includes:
* ''[[Drug classification: making a hash of it?]]'', Fifth Report of Session 2005–06, House of Commons [[Science and Technology Committee]], which said that the present system of drug classification is based on historical assumptions, not scientific assessment<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmsctech/1031/1031.pdf ''Drug classification: making a hash of it?'', Fifth Report of Session 2005–06, House of Commons Science and Technology Committee, accessed 29 January 2009]</ref>
*  ''Development of a rational scale to assess the harm of drugs of potential misuse'', David Nutt, Leslie A. King, William Saulsbury, Colin Blakemore, [[The Lancet]], 24 March 2007, said the act is "not fit for purpose" and "the exclusion of alcohol and tobacco from the Misuse of Drugs Act is, from a scientific perspective, arbitrary"<ref>{{cite pmid|17382831}}</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6474053.stm?ls#drugs ''Scientists want new drug rankings'', BBC News website, 23 March 2007, accessed 27 January 2009]</ref>
*  The ''[[Drug Equality Alliance (DEA)]]'' argue that the Government is administering the Act arbitrarily, contrary to its purpose, contrary to the original wishes of Parliament and therefore illegally. They are currently assisting and supporting several legal challenges to this alleged maladministration. <ref>http://www.drugequality.org/cases.htm</ref> .
