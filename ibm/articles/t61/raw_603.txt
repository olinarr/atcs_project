Since their discovery, '''[[anabolic steroids]]''' (AAS) have been widely used as an '''[[ergogenic aid]]''' to improve performance in [[sports]], to improve one's physical appearance, as [[self-medication]] to recover from injury, and as an anti-aging aid.  . 

Use of anabolic steroids for purposes other than treating medical conditions is controversial and, in some cases, illegal. Major sports organizations have moved to ban the use of anabolic steroids. There is a wide range of health concerns for users. Legislation in many countries restricts and criminalizes AAS possession and trade. A political counter current has formed in some of these countries.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}.  .

Performance-enhancing substances have been used for thousands of years in [[traditional medicine]] by societies around the world, with the aim of promoting vitality and strength. <ref name=ADH>{{cite web| title = A short doping history| publisher = Anti-Doping Hotline| url = http://www.dopingjouren.se/page.asp?page=history| accessdate = 2007-04-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071008174029/http://www.dopingjouren.se/page.asp?page=history |archivedate = 2007-10-08}}</ref> The use of [[gonadal]] [[hormone]]s pre-dates their identification and isolation.

Testosterone, the most active anabolic-androgenic steroid produced by Leydig cells in the testes, was first isolated in 1935 and [[chemical synthesis|chemically synthesized]] later in the same year. Synthetic derivatives of testosterone quickly followed. By the end of the following decade, both testosterone and its derivatives were applied with varying degrees of success for a number of medical conditions. It was not until the 1950s, however, that athletes began to discover that anabolic steroids could increase their [[muscle|muscle mass]]. According to sports physician [[John Bosley Ziegler|John Ziegler]], the first confirmed use of an anabolic steroid in an international athletic competition was at the weightlifting championships in Vienna in 1954, when the Russians weightlifters used testosterone. <ref name=science176>{{cite journal | author = Wade N | year = 1972 | title = Anabolic steroids: doctors denounce them, but athletes aren't listening | jstor = 1734568 | journal = Science | volume = 176 | issue = | pages = 1399–1403 |bibcode=1972Sci...176.1399W | doi=10.1126/science.176.4042.1399}}</ref> . 

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the use of anabolic steroids was confined largely to the professional levels of sport. In the [[Eastern bloc]], programs of training went as far as forcing some athletes to take anabolic steroids.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In the United States, sports physicians, including Ziegler, and medical texts were still widely proclaiming that anabolic steroids were ineffective in helping athletes gain muscle. These doctors did acknowledge the usefulness of anabolic steroids for debilitated patients. The package insert for [[Dianabol]], a common anabolic steroid used at the time, stated, "Anabolic steroids do not enhance athletic ability."<ref name=science176/> Despite these warnings, use of anabolic steroids began in competition bodybuilding, in [[track and field]] events, such as the [[shot put]], and in other sports where performance depended on muscle strength or speed of recovery during training. <ref name=kanayama08>{{cite journal |author=Kanayama G, Hudson JI, Pope HG |title=Long-term psychiatric and medical consequences of anabolic-androgenic steroid abuse: a looming public health concern? |journal=Drug Alcohol Depend |volume=98 |issue=1-2 |pages=1–12 |year=2008 |month=November |pmid=18599224 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2008.05.004 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0376-8716(08)00191-9 |pmc=2646607}}</ref> . 

At the end of the 1960s, ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' published a study on the effects of [[Dianabol]] on athletes. This [[open label]] study, conducted by J.P. O'Shea and colleagues at [[Oregon State University]], confirmed the muscle building effects of anabolic steroids on athletes that followed a high protein diet. <ref>L. C. Johnson and J. P.

At the beginning of the 1970s, sporting organizations, including the [[IOC]] and [[NCAA]], declared the use of anabolic steroids unethical, but with no effective means of testing athletes, the issue remained academic. <ref name=science176/> . 

== Protocols ==. 
=== Steroid cycle ===. 
A steroid cycle refers to the frequency or schedule of an individual's steroid use. Different anabolic steroids vary in [[half-life]], and thus individuals typically use each steroid at different intervals of time.  Some individuals also take multiple types of steroids at a time, known as "steroid stacking."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.steroid-cycles.com/|title=Steroid Cycles|publisher=Steroid-Cycles.com|accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref>  . 

The complete time interval of an individual's use typically lasts 6–12 weeks. <ref name="pmid11929356">{{cite journal |author=Kutscher EC, Lund BC, Perry PJ |title=Anabolic steroids: a review for the clinician |journal=[[Sports Med]] |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=285–96 |year=2002 |pmid=11929356 |doi= 10.2165/00007256-200232050-00001|url=}}</ref> . 

== Prevalence and user profiles ==.

It is difficult to determine what percent of the population have used anabolic steroids.

Anabolic steroids have been used by athletes in many professional sports, including [[cricket]], [[track and field]], [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]], [[bodybuilding]], [[shot put]], [[cycling]], [[baseball]], [[wrestling]], [[mixed martial arts]], [[boxing]], and [[football]]. Such use is prohibited by many of the professional and amateur associations that organize these sports.  . 

Anabolic steroid use occurs among adolescents, especially by those participating in competitive sports. It has been suggested that the prevalence of use among high-school students in the U.S. may be as high as 2.7%. <ref>{{cite journal|author=Hickson R, Czerwinski S, Falduto M, Young A

== Legal status and politics == . 

The legal status of anabolic steroids varies from country to country. In the U.S., anabolic steroids are listed as Schedule III [[controlled substances]] under the [[Controlled Substances Act]], which makes the possession of such substances without a prescription a federal crime punishable by up to seven years in prison. <ref name="usdoj"/> In Canada, anabolic steroids and their derivatives are part of the Controlled drugs and substances act and are [[Schedule IV (Canada)|Schedule IV]] substances, meaning that it is illegal to obtain or sell them without a prescription. However, possession is not punishable, a consequence reserved for schedule I, II or III substances. Those guilty of buying or selling anabolic steroids in Canada can be imprisoned for up to 18 months. Importing or exporting anabolic steroids also carry similar penalties. <ref>{{cite web |url= http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowFullDoc/cs/C-38.8//20070425/en?command=home&caller=SI&fragment=anabolic&search_type=all&day=25&month=4&year=2007&search_domain=cs&showall=L&statuteyear=all&lengthannual=50&length=50|title= Controlled Drugs and Substances Act|publisher = Canada Department of Justice|accessdate= 2007-04-25}}</ref> Anabolic steroids are also illegal without prescription in Australia,<ref>{{cite web| title = Steroids| publisher = Australian Institute of Criminology| year = 2006| url = http://www.aic.gov.au/research/drugs/types/steroids.html| accessdate =2007-05-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070405033442/http://www.aic.gov.au/research/drugs/types/steroids.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-04-05}}</ref> Argentina, Brazil, and Portugal,<ref>{{cite web| title = Library of congress search| publisher = Library of congress| url = http://www.glin.gov/search.action?searchDetails.andSubjectTerms=true&searchDetails.hitsPerPage=10&searchDetails.includeAbstractFields=false&searchDetails.includeAllFields=true&searchDetails.includeNameFields=false&searchDetails.includeNumberFields=false&searchDetails.includeTitleFields=false&searchDetails.issuanceDateFrom=&searchDetails.issuanceDateTo=&searchDetails.offset=0&searchDetails.publicationDateFrom=&searchDetails.publicationDateTo=&searchDetails.publicationJurisdictionExclude=false&searchDetails.publicationLanguage=&searchDetails.queryString=steroid&searchDetails.queryType=ALL&searchDetails.searchAll=true&searchDetails.searchJudicialDecisions=false&searchDetails.searchLaws=false&searchDetails.searchLegalLiterature=false&searchDetails.searchLegislativeRecord=false&searchDetails.showSummary=true&searchDetails.sortOrder=default&searchDetails.subjectTerm=%5B%5D&searchDetails.subjectTerms=&searchDetails.summaryLanguage=&searchDetails.activeDrills=&searchDetails.offset=0&showSummary=true&refineQuery=anabolic&refineQueryType=ALL&refine=Refine+Search| accessdate =2007-05-06 }}</ref> and are listed as Schedule&nbsp;4 [[Controlled Drug]]s in the United Kingdom. However, anabolic steroids are readily available without a prescription in some countries, such as Mexico and Thailand.  . 

=== United States ===. 
The United States first considered classifying anabolic steroids as a controlled substance in the late 1980s after a controversy over [[Ben Johnson (sprinter)|Ben Johnson's]] victory at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]]. During deliberations, the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA), [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), and the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] (NIDA) all opposed listing anabolic steroids as controlled substances. These organizations argued that use of these drugs  does not lead to the physical or psychological dependence required for such scheduling under the Controlled Substance Act. However, anabolic steroids were added to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act in the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 1990. <ref name="congress">{{USBill|101|HR|4658}}</ref> The same act also introduced more stringent controls with higher criminal penalties for offenses involving the illegal distribution of anabolic steroids and human growth hormone. By the early 1990s, after non-medical use of anabolic steroids was criminalized in the U.S., several pharmaceutical companies stopped manufacturing or marketing the products. Some brand names included Ciba, Searle, and Syntex. In the Controlled Substances Act, anabolic steroids are defined to be any drug or hormonal substance chemically and pharmacologically related to testosterone (other than [[estrogen]]s, [[progestin]]s, and [[corticosteroid]]s) that promote muscle growth. The act was amended by the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004, which added [[prohormone]]s to the list of [[controlled substance]]s, with effect from January 20, 2005. <ref name="usdoj">{{cite web | url=http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/cngrtest/ct031604.html | title=News from DEA, Congressional Testimony, 03/16/04 | accessdate=2007-04-24}}</ref> . 

====Movement for decriminalization====. 
=== United Kingdom === . 

In the United Kingdom, anabolic steroids are classified as class C drugs for their illegal abuse potential, which puts them in the same class as [[benzodiazepines]]. In 2008, a study published in the ''[[The Lancet|Lancet]]'' suggested that anabolic steroids are less dangerous than most other illegal substances, and some legal ones. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6474053.stm | work=BBC News | title=Scientists want new drug rankings | date=2007-03-23 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> .

In September 2007, the DEA completed an 18-month international investigation of illicit anabolic steroid use in which 124 arrests were made. The investigation targeted more than 25 Chinese companies which produced raw materials for producing steroids and [[Growth hormone treatment|human growth hormone]]. The companies exported raw products to Mexico, where the consumer products were packaged. The investigation, dubbed "Operation Gear Grinder," was the largest anabolic steroid operation in the United States, and involved China, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Germany, and Thailand, among other countries.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The investigation also focused on online message boards where advice was given on how to use anabolic steroids. The DEA also intercepted thousands of e-mails in the course of the investigation. The [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] has stated that the e-mails intercepted were compiled into a massive database of names which could lead to months or years of future arrests of steroid users. <ref>{{cite news | first=Pete | last=YOST | coauthors= | title=DEA Announces Wide-Ranging Steroid Busts | publisher=[[Associated press]] | url =http://www.sfgate.com/flat/archive/2007/09/24/news/archive/2007/09/24/national/w073110D79.html | accessdate = 2007-09-24 | date=2007-09-24}}</ref><ref name=Assael>{{cite news | first=Shaun | last=Assael| title='Raw Deal' busts labs across U.S., many supplied by China | date=2007-09-24 | url =http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=3033532 | work =ESPN The Magazine | pages = | accessdate = 2007-09-24 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Josh | last=Peter | title='Roids raids' | date=2007-09-24 | publisher= | url =http://sports.yahoo.com/top/news?slug=jo-steroids092407&prov=yhoo&type=lgns | work =Yahoo!

===Production===. 
Anabolic steroids are produced in pharmaceutical laboratories, but in nations where stricter laws are present, they are also produced in small homemade laboratories. <ref name=Assael/> Common problems associated with illegal drug trades, such as chemical substitutions, cutting, and diluting, affect illegal anabolic steroids, so that when they reach the distribution level, the quality may be compromised and the drugs may be dangerous. In the 1990s, most U.S. producers such as [[Ciba]], [[Searle (company)|Searle]] and [[Syntex]] stopped making and marketing anabolic steroids within the U.S. However, in many other regions, particularly Eastern Europe, they are still mass produced. European anabolic steroids are the source of most medical grade anabolic steroids sold illegally in North America.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}  . 

Anabolic steroids are still in wide use for veterinary purposes, and often contain the same components as those prepared for humans, but without the same quality control. <ref>{{cite web| title = Steroids| work = North Eastern AIDS Prevention Program| publisher = Victoria Australia Department of Human Services| url = http://www.dhs.vic.gov.au/neapp/steroids.htm|accessdate = 2007-04-24 }}</ref> These can also be dangerous, as they may have been produced and handled in cruder and less sterile environments. <ref>{{cite web| title = Anabolic Steroid Abuse and Violence| publisher = NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research| month = July | year = 1997|url=http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/bocsar/ll_bocsar.nsf/vwFiles/cjb35.pdf/$file/cjb35.pdf| format = PDF|accessdate = 2007-05-06 }}</ref> . 

===Distribution===. 
In the U.S., Canada, and Europe, illicit steroids are purchased just like any other illegal drug. Dealers are able to obtain the steroids from a number of sources. Illegal anabolic steroids are sometimes sold at gyms, competitions, and through the mail, but may also be obtained through pharmacists, veterinarians, and physicians. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gdcada.org/statistics/steroids.htm |title=Steroids |accessdate=2007-09-13 |work=National Institute on Drug Abuse |publisher=GDCADA |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070911222757/http://www.gdcada.org/statistics/steroids.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-11}}</ref> In addition, a significant number of counterfeit products are sold as anabolic steroids, particularly via mail order from websites posing as overseas pharmacies. Individuals also produce fake steroids and attempt to sell them over the Internet, causing a wide variety of health concerns.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} In the U.S., black market importation continues from Mexico, Thailand, and other countries where steroids are not illegal. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/reports/DEA/a0719/app2.htm |title=The Drug Enforcement Administration's International Operations (Redacted) |accessdate=2007-09-13 |work=Office of the Inspector General |publisher=USDOJ }}</ref> .
