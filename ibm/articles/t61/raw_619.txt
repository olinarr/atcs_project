In [[pharmacology]], a drug is "a [[chemical]] substance used in the treatment, cure, prevention, or diagnosis of disease or used to otherwise enhance physical or mental well-being."<ref name="diccom" /> Drugs may be prescribed for a limited duration, or on a regular basis for [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic disorders]]. <ref name="ahsci">[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/drug "Drug."] ''The American Heritage Science Dictionary'', [[Houghton Mifflin Company]], via dictionary.com.

Drugs are usually distinguished from [[endogenous]] biochemicals by being introduced from outside the organism.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} For example, [[insulin]] is a hormone that is synthesized in the body; it is called a hormone when it is synthesized by the pancreas inside the body, but if it is introduced into the body from outside, it is called a drug.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
Many natural substances, such as [[beer]]s, [[wine]]s, and [[psychoactive mushrooms]], blur the line between food and recreational drugs, as when ingested they affect the functioning of both [[mind]] and [[body]] and some substances normally considered drugs such as DMT (Dimethyltryptamine) are actually produced by the human body in trace amounts.  . 

== Etymology ==. 
Drug is thought to originate from Old French "drogue", possibly deriving later into "droge-vate" from Middle Dutch meaning "dry barrels", referring to medicinal plants preserved in them. <ref name="etymonline-drug">{{OEtymD|drug}}</ref> . 

== Medication ==. 
[[File:Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium) pills.JPG|thumb|right|[[Nexium]] pills 40 mg<br> (esomeprazole magnesium)]]
{{Main|pharmaceutical drug}}
A ''medication'' or ''medicine'' is a drug taken to cure and/or ameliorate any symptoms of an [[illness]] or medical condition, or may be used as [[preventive medicine]] that has future benefits but does not treat any existing or pre-existing diseases or symptoms.  . 

Dispensing of medication is often regulated by [[government]]s into three categories—''[[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]]'' (OTC) medications, which are available in [[pharmacy|pharmacies]] and supermarkets without special restrictions, ''[[behind-the-counter]]'' (BTC), which are dispensed by a [[pharmacist]] without needing a doctor's prescription, and ''[[prescription medication|prescription only medicine]]s'' (POM), which must be prescribed by a licensed [[medical professional]], usually a [[physician]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} . 

In the United Kingdom, BTC medicines are called [[pharmacy medicine]]s which can only be sold in registered pharmacies, by or under the supervision of a pharmacist. These medications are designated by the letter P on the label. <ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.mhra.gov.uk/SearchHelp/Glossary/GlossaryP| title = Glossary of MHRA terms - P| publisher = [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|MHRA]]| accessdate = 2008-11-05}}</ref> The range of medicines available without a prescription varies from country to country.  . 

Medications are typically produced by pharmaceutical companies and are often [[patent]]ed to give the developer exclusive rights to produce them, but they can also be derived from naturally occurring substance in plants called [[herbal medicine]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Those that are not patented (or with expired patents) are called [[generic drug]]s since they can be produced by other companies without restrictions or licenses from the patent holder.  . 

== Spiritual and religious use ==. 
{{Main|Entheogen}}
The spiritual and religious use of drugs has been occurring since the dawn of our species. Drugs that are considered to have spiritual or religious use are called entheogens. Some religions are based completely on the use of certain drugs. Entheogens are mostly [[hallucinogen]]s, being either [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelics]] or [[deliriant]]s, but some are also [[stimulant]]s and [[sedative]]s.  . 

== Self-improvement ==. 
{{Main|Nootropic}}
Nootropics, also commonly referred to as "smart drugs", are drugs that are claimed to improve human cognitive abilities. Nootropics are used to improve memory, concentration, thought, mood, learning, and many other things. Some nootropics are now beginning to be used to treat certain diseases such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. They are also commonly used to regain brain function lost during aging. Similarly, Drugs such as [[steroids]] improve human physical capabilities and are sometimes used (legally or not) for this purpose, often by professional athletes.  . 

== Recreational drug use ==. 
[[Image:Papierosa 1 ubt 0069.jpeg|thumb|The [[cigarette]] is the common pharmaceutical form of [[tobacco]] – one of the world’s best selling drugs. <ref>According to the [http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=567 statistic] of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] the production quantity in 2006 of coffee was 7.8 million tonnes and of tobacco was 6.7 million tonnes. </ref>]]

{{Main|Recreational drug use}}
{{Further2|[[Prohibition of drugs]]}}
Recreational drugs use is the use of psychoactive substances to have fun, for the experience, or to enhance an already positive experience. National laws prohibit the use of many different recreational drugs and medicinal drugs that have the potential for recreational use are heavily regulated. Many other recreational drugs on the other hand are legal, widely culturally accepted, and at the most have an age restriction on using and/or purchasing them. These include alcohol, tobacco, betel nut, and caffeine products in the west, and in other localised areas of the world drugs such as Khat are common. Because of the legal status of many drugs, recreational drug use is controversial, with many governments not recognising spiritual or other perceived uses for drugs and classing them under illegal recreational use.  . 

==Administering drugs==. 
Drugs, both medicinal and recreational, can be administered in a number of ways. Many drugs can be administered in a variety of ways rather than just one. 
*[[Bolus (medicine)|Bolus]]
*[[Inhalation|Inhaled]], (breathed into the lungs), as an [[aerosol]] or dry powder. (This includes smoking a substance)
*[[Injection (medicine)|Injected]] as a solution, suspension or emulsion either: [[intramuscular]], [[intravenous]], [[intraperitoneal]], [[intraosseous]]. 
*[[Insufflation (medicine)|Insufflation]], or snorted into the nose. 
*[[Mouth|Oral]]ly, as a liquid or solid, that is absorbed through the [[intestine]]s. 
*[[Rectum|Rectally]] as a [[suppository]], that is absorbed by the rectum or colon. 
*[[Sublingual administration|Sublingually]], diffusing into the blood through tissues under the tongue. 
*[[Topical]]ly, usually as a [[cream]] or [[ointment]]. A drug administered in this manner may be given to act locally or systemically. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nursingtimes.net/nursing-practice-clinical-research/the-administration-of-medicine/288560.article |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}</ref>
*[[Vagina]]lly as a [[suppository]], primarily to treat vaginal infections.  . 

== Legal definition of drugs ==. 
Some governments define the term drug by law. In the United States, the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] definition of "drug" includes "articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals" and "articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals."<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/opacom/laws/fdcact/fdcact1.htm "Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act"] (Website.) U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Retrieved on 24 September 2007. </ref> Consistent with that definition, the U.S. separately defines [[narcotic]] drugs and controlled substances, which may include non-drugs, and explicitly excludes [[tobacco]], [[caffeine]] and [[alcoholic beverage]]s. <ref>[http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/csa/802.htm "21 USC Sec. 802."] (Website.) U.S. Department of Justice. Retrieved on 24 September 2007. </ref> . 

== Governmental controls ==. 
{{Globalize|section|date=November 2009}}
In [[Canada]] the government has moved to remove the influence of drug companies on the medical system.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  “The influence that the pharmaceutical companies, the for-profits, are having on every aspect of medicine ... is so blatant now you'd have to be deaf, blind and dumb not to see it,” said [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] editor Dr. Catherine DeAngelis. <ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26622463/ "Med schools, journals fight big pharma's sway"] (Website.) MSNBC. Retrieved on 11 November 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-09-10-doctors-drugmakers_N.htm "Medical schools, journals start to fight drug industry influence"] (Website.)
