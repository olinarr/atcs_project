'''Recreational drug use''' is the use of a [[drug]] with the intention of creating or enhancing [[recreation]]al experience. 
Drugs commonly considered capable of recreational use include [[alcohol]], [[tobacco]], [[caffeine]], and drugs within the scope of the [[United Nations]] [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] and [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]]. [[Psychopharmacology|Psychopharmacologist]] [[Ronald K. Siegel]] refers to intoxication as the "fourth drive", arguing that the human instinct to seek mind-altering substances ([[psychoactive drug]]s) has so much force and persistence that it functions like the human desire to satisfy hunger, thirst, and the need for shelter. <ref>{{cite book |last=Siegel |first=Ronald K |title=Intoxication: The universal drive for mind-altering substances |publisher=Park Street Press |year=2005 |location=Vermont |pages=vii |isbn=1-59477-069-7 |nopp=true}}</ref> . 

==Definition==. 
{{Main|Responsible drug use}}
The concept of "responsible drug use" is that a person can use recreational drugs with reduced or eliminated risk of negatively affecting other aspects of one's life or other people's lives. In general, this takes place at a party or party-like event. Advocates of this philosophy point to the many well-known artists and intellectuals who have used drugs, experimentally or otherwise, with few detrimental effects on their lives. Critics argue that the drugs are escapist — and dangerous, unpredictable and sometimes addictive, and have negative and profound effects in geographic areas well beyond the location of the user. These criticisms can apply to a number of non-drug-related addictions and behavioral abuse disorders. Responsible drug use becomes drug abuse only when the use of the substance significantly interferes with the user's daily life.  . 

Responsible drug use advocates that users should not take drugs at the same time as activities such as driving, swimming, operating machinery, or other activities that are unsafe without a sober state. Responsible drug use is emphasized as a primary prevention technique in harm-reduction drug policies. Harm-reduction policies were popularized in the late 1980s, although they began in the 1970s counter-culture where users were distributed cartoons explaining responsible drug use and consequences of irresponsible drug use. <ref>{{cite book |title=The Sociology of American Drug Use |pages=366 |author=Charles E. Faupel |coauthors=Alan M. Horowitz, Greg S. Weaver |publisher=McGraw Hill}}</ref> Another issue is that the illegality of drugs in itself may also cause social and economic consequences for those using them — the drugs may be "cut" with adulturants and the purity varies wildly, making overdoses more likely — and legal regulation of drug production and distribution would alleviate these and other dangers of illegal drug use. <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=13237193 |title=Failed states and failed policies, How to stop the drug wars |accessdate=2009-03-10 |date=2009-03-05 |work=The Economist}}</ref> Harm reduction seeks to minimize the harm that can occur through the use of various drugs, whether legal (e.g., alcohol and nicotine), or illegal (e.g., heroin and cocaine). For example, people who inject illicit drugs can minimize harm to both themselves and members of the community through proper injecting technique, using new needles and syringes each time, and proper disposal of all injecting equipment.  .

===Common psychoactives===. 
The drugs most popular for recreational use worldwide are:<ref>Lingeman, Drugs from A-Z A Dictionary, Penguin ISBN 0 7139 0136 5</ref> {{Update after|2010|11|13}}
* [[caffeine]] and [[theobromine]] (from [[coffee]], [[tea]], [[cocoa solids|cocoa]] and other plant sources) – legal in all parts of the world, but not consumed by members of some religions. 
* [[cannabis]] (in the form of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] or [[hashish]]. Contains [[cannabinoid]]s, primarily THC – [[tetrahydrocannabinol]]. Illegal in most parts of the world. 
* [[ethanol]] (ethyl [[alcohol]], commonly referred to as simply alcohol, produced through fermentation by yeast in [[alcoholic beverage]]s such as wine and beer) – legal but regulated in most parts of the world, and illegal in [[Islamic dietary laws#Alcohol|several Muslim countries]] such as Pakistan, Libya, Sudan, and Saudi Arabia; not consumed by members of some religions. It acts as a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist. In chemistry, [[alcohol]] can refer to more than ethyl alcohol. [[Methanol]] (methyl alcohol, or wood alcohol) is poisonous. 
* tobacco (contains [[nicotine]] and [[beta-carboline]] [[alkaloid]]s) – legal but regulated in most parts of the world and not consumed by members of some religions. <ref name= "MAAOI">MAOI action of Beta-Carbolines in Tobacco, http://www.biopsychiatry.com/maoi-smoke.htm</ref> {{Better source|date=May 2010}}
* [[opiates]] and [[opioids]] – in general legal by prescription only, for relief of pain. Opiates used for recreational purposes are [[morphine]] and [[codeine]]. Opioids include [[heroin]] (diacetylmorphine, not used in medicine in most countries), [[oxycodone]], [[hydromorphone]], [[hydrocodone]] (''[[Vicodin]]''), [[fentanyl]], [[pethidine]], [[tramadol]] and others. See also: [[naloxone]]/[[naltrexone]] (antidotes for opioids), [[opiate replacement therapy]], [[opium]], [[opium poppy|poppy]] and [[poppy tea]]. 
* [[cocaine]] – a [[sympathomimetic]] [[stimulant]] derived from the [[coca plant]] in South America. Use of the stimulating coca leaf (e.g. chewing it, often with [[slaked lime]] to increase [[bioavailability]]), but not cocaine, is legal in Peru and Bolivia. Cocaine is illegal in most parts of the world. It was formerly used in medicine and dentistry for local anesthesia. Derivatives such as [[lidocaine]] and [[novocaine]] are now used instead.  . 

Other popular drugs are:
* [[amphetamine]] (''[[Adderall]]''), [[methamphetamine]] (''Desoxyn''), [[methylphenidate]] (''Ritalin'', ''Concerta'') – stimulants (sympathomimetic), all three are prescribed for [[ADHD]]
* [[modafinil]] and its active enantiomer, [[armodafinil]] – [[eugeroic]] stimulants, prescription drugs
* [[MDPV]] with effects similar to amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine and methylphenidate
* [[MDMA]] – a stimulant ([[entactogen]]) and a [[psychedelic]] ([[phenethylamine]]), in ecstasy pills (described below) or in crystal form; illegal virtually everywhere
* ecstasy (xtc, extasy) pills – often equated with [[MDMA]], although they may contain other stimulants and/or psychedelics, and sometimes also dangerous [[adulterants]] (see the section below with list of substances in ecstasy)
* [[LSD]] – a psychedelic [[tryptamine]], also [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]]; [[2C (psychedelics)|2C family]], [[2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine|DOB]], [[4-chloro-2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine|DOC]], [[2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine|DOI]], [[2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine|DOM]] – psychedelic [[phenethylamines]]
* [[psilocybin mushrooms]] (containing [[psilocybin]] and [[psilocin]], tryptamines) and other [[psychoactive mushrooms]]
* [[tranquilizers]] ([[sedatives]], most of them are prescription drugs): [[barbiturates]], [[benzodiazepines]], [[nonbenzodiazepines]] and others (including [[gamma-hydroxybutyrate|GHB]], known for its use as a [[date-rape drug]], but also as a [[party drug]])
* [[kava]] – [[sedative]] plant
* following [[dissociatives]]: [[ketamine]], [[phencyclidine]] (PCP), [[nitrous oxide]] ([[laughing gas]]), [[alkyl nitrates]] ([[Poppers]]), [[diethyl ether]]
* [[khat]] containing [[cathine]] and [[cathinone]] ([[stimulants]])
* over-the-counter medications (in some countries they might be prescription drugs): [[dextromethorphan]] (DXM, [[dissociative]]), codeine ([[opiate]], often with [[paracetamol]] to discourage recreational use), some [[deliriants]] ([[benzydamine]], [[dimenhydrinate]] and [[diphenhydramine]]) and stimulants ([[ephedrine]] and [[pseudoephedrine]])
* recreational [[designer drugs]] (e.g. [[Benzylpiperazine|BZP]], [[mephedrone]]) and [[synthetic cannabis]]
* [[salvia divinorum]] containing Salvinorin A producing dissociative effects and hallucinations
* [[nutmeg]] (the spice found in groceries) containing [[myristicin]] – a [[deliriant]]
* widespread plants – for example those from ''[[Solanaceae]]'' [[family (biology)|family]] (e.g. [[datura]], [[Atropa belladonna|deadly nightshade]]) which contain following [[deliriants]]: [[atropine]], [[hyoscyamine]] and [[scopolamine]] ([[pilocarpine]] is antidote in overdoses)
* inhalants – solvents, propellants and fumes of glues containing these, but also nitrous oxide ([[laughing gas]]), [[Poppers]] (alkyl nitrites), diethyl ether and others (see also the section about them) . 

Drugs most often associated with a particular [[route of administration]]:
* [[intravenous injection]] – [[morphine]] and heroin, less commonly other opioids or stimulants like cocaine or amphetamine, but almost every substance (with some exceptions) can be injected; see also the article [[Drug injection]]
* [[smoking]] (see also the section below) – tobacco, cannabis, [[opium]], methamphetamine, [[crack cocaine]] and brown sugar heroin
* [[insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]] – [[snuff]] (tobacco), amphetamine and cocaine
* [[inhalation]] – all inhalants (listed above), as the name suggests
* most drugs are primarily (although not necessarily) taken orally, including caffeine, ethanol, hash cakes (cannabis), nutmeg, datura, psilocybin mushrooms, [[coca plant|coca]] leaves, [[poppy tea]], [[laudanum]], [[gamma-hydroxybutyrate|GHB]], PCP, [[LSD]], ketamine, [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]] pills with various substances (mainly stimulants and psychedelics), prescription and over-the-counter drugs (ADHD and narcolepsy medications, sleeping pills, anxiolytics, sedatives, cough suppressants, benzydamine, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, morphine, codeine, opioids and others).  . 

===List of substances in ecstasy pills===. 
A partial list of substances known to have been detected in ecstasy tablets includes: . 

* [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|MDMA]]
* [[Methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]], [[Methylenedioxyethylamphetamine|MDEA]], [[Methylbenzodioxolylbutanamine|MBDB]], [[Methylenedioxyhydroxyamphetamine|MDOH]]
* [[methylone]], [[ethylone]], [[butylone]]
* [[amphetamine]], methamphetamine
* ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, [[phenylpropanolamine]]
* [[Paramethoxyamphetamine|PMA]], [[Paramethoxymethamphetamine|PMMA]], [[Paramethoxyethylamphetamine|PMEA]], [[4-Methylthioamphetamine|4-MTA]], [[mephedrone]], [[methedrine]]
* [[Benzylpiperazine|BZP]], [[Trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine|TFMPP]], [[Dibenzylpiperazine|DBZP]], [[Methylbenzylpiperazine|MBZP]], [[meta-Chlorophenylpiperazine|mCPP]], [[Methylenedioxybenzylpiperazine|MDBZP]], [[para-Methoxyphenylpiperazine|meOPP]], [[para-Fluorophenylpiperazine|pFPP]]
* [[2C-B]], [[2C-E]], [[2C-I]], [[2C-T-2]], [[2C-T-7]], [[5-MeO-DiPT]], [[Alphamethyltryptamine|AMT]]
* [[dextromethorphan]], [[ketamine]]
* [[Acetaminophen|paracetamol]], [[ibuprofen]], caffeine
* various non-psychoactive (but possibly dangerous) [[adulterants]] . 

Certain other agents such as [[cocaine]] and heroin are rarely, if ever found in such tablets; it would not make economic sense for distributors to sell them as a relatively cheaper drug, ecstasy.  . 

There have been a number of deaths attributed to [[para-Methoxyamphetamine|PMA]], a potent and highly neurotoxic hallucinogenic amphetamine, being sold as ecstasy. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Refstad S |title=Paramethoxyamphetamine (PMA) poisoning; a 'party drug' with lethal effects |journal=Acta Anaesthesiol Scand |volume=47 |issue=10 |pages=1298–9 |year=2003 |pmid=14616331 |doi= 10.1046/j.1399-6576.2003.00245.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lamberth PG, Ding GK, Nurmi LA |title=Fatal paramethoxy-amphetamine (PMA) poisoning in the Australian Capital Territory |journal=Med. J. Aust. |volume=188 |issue=7 |page=426 |year=2008 |pmid=18393753}}</ref> PMA is unique in its ability to quickly elevate body temperature and heart rate at relatively low doses, especially in comparison to MDMA. Hence, a user believing he is consuming two 120&nbsp;mg pills of MDMA could actually be consuming a dose of PMA that is potentially lethal, depending on the purity of the pill. Not only does PMA cause the release of serotonin but it also acts as a [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor|monoamine oxidase inhibitor, MAOI]]. When combined with an MDMA or an MDMA-like substance, [[serotonin syndrome]] can result. <ref>J Pharm Pharmacol. 1980 Apr;32(4):262-6. </ref> Combining MAO inhibitors with certain legal prescription and over the counter medications can also lead to (potentially fatal) serotonin syndrome.  .

===Other psychoactives===. 
====Depressants====. 
[[Depressant]]s are psychoactive drugs that temporarily diminish the function or activity of a specific part of the body or mind. <ref name="urlMSDS Glossary">{{cite web |url= http://www.utexas.edu/safety/ehs/msds/glossary/?page=d |title=MSDS Glossary |accessdate=2009-01-01}}</ref> Examples of these kinds of effects may include anxiolysis, sedation, and hypotension. Due to their effects typically having a "down" quality to them, depressants are also occasionally referred to as "downers". Stimulants or "uppers", which increase mental and/or physical function, are in stark contrast to depressants and are considered to be their functional opposites. Depressants are widely used throughout the world as [[prescription medicine]]s and as [[prohibition (drugs)|illicit substances]]. When these are used, effects may include [[anxiolysis]], [[analgesia]], [[sedation]], [[somnolence]], cognitive/memory impairment, [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], muscle relaxation, lowered [[blood pressure]]/[[heart rate]], [[respiratory depression]], [[anesthesia]], and [[anticonvulsant]] effects. Some are also capable of inducing feelings of [[euphoria]]. Depressants exert their effects through a number of different pharmacological mechanisms, the most prominent of which include facilitation of [[GABA]] and/or [[opioid]] activity, and inhibition of [[adrenergic]], [[histamine]] and/or [[acetylcholine]] activity.  . 

=====Antihistamines=====. 
[[Antihistamine]]s (or "histamine antagonists") inhibit the release or action of [[histamine]]. "Antihistamine" can be used to describe any histamine antagonist, but the term is usually reserved for the [[H1 antagonist|classical antihistamines]] that act upon the [[histamine H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub> histamine receptor]]. Antihistamines are used as treatment for [[allergies]]. Allergies are caused by an excessive response of the body to [[allergens]], such as the [[pollen]] released by grasses and trees. An allergic reaction causes release of histamine by the body. Other uses of antihistamines are to help with normal symptoms of insect stings even if there is no allergic reaction. Their recreational appeal exists mainly due to their [[anticholinergic]] properties, that induce [[anxiolysis]] and, in some cases such as [[diphenhydramine]], [[chlorpheniramine]], and [[orphenadrine]], a characteristic euphoria at moderate doses.  . 

Hallucinations and possibly delirium resembling the effects of [[Datura stramonium]] can result if the drug is taken in much higher than therapeutical dosages.  . 

Antihistamines are widely available over the counter at drug stores (without a prescription), in the form of allergy medication and some cough medicines. They are sometimes used in combination with other substances such as alcohol. 
The most common unsupervised use of antihistamines in terms of volume and percentage of the total is perhaps in parallel to the medicinal use of some antihistamines to stretch out and intensify the effects of opioids and depressants. The most commonly used are [[hydroxyzine]], mainly to stretch out a supply of other drugs, as in medical use, and the above-mentioned ethanolamine and alkylamine-class first-generation antihistamines, which are - once again as in the 1950s - the subject of medical research into their anti-depressant properties.  . 

For all of the above reasons, the use of medicinal scopolamine for recreational uses is also seen.  . 

=====Analgesics=====. 
[[Analgesic]]s (also known as "painkillers") are used to relieve [[pain]] (achieve [[wikt:analgesia|analgesia]]). The word ''analgesic'' derives from Greek "αν-" (''an-'', "without") and "άλγος" (''álgos'', "pain"). Analgesic drugs act in various ways on the [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] and [[central nervous system|central]] nervous systems; they include [[paracetamol]] (para-acetylaminophenol, also known in the US as acetaminophen), the [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs) such as the [[salicylate]]s, and [[opioid]] drugs such as [[hydrocodone]], [[codeine]], [[heroin]] and [[oxycodone]]. Some further examples of the [[Brand|brand name]] [[prescription medication|prescription]] [[opiate]]s and [[opioid]] analgesics that may be used recreationally include Vicodin, Lortab, Norco (hydrocodone), Avinza, Kapanol (morphine), Opana, Paramorphan (oxymorphone), Dilaudid, Palladone (hydromorphone), and OxyContin (oxycodone), [[kratom]].  . 

=====Tranquilizers=====. 
[[Tranquilizer]]s ([[gamma-Aminobutyric acid#GABAergic Drugs|GABAergics]]):
* [[Barbiturate]]s
* [[Benzodiazepine]]s
* [[Nonbenzodiazepine]]s
* [[Ethanol]]
* Others

** [[Valerian (herb)|valerian]] (from ''[[Valeriana officinalis]]'') . 

====Hallucinogens====. 
[[Hallucinogen]]s can be divided into three broad categories: [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]]s, [[dissociative]]s, and [[deliriant]]s. They can cause subjective changes in [[perception]], [[thought]], [[emotion]] and [[consciousness]]. Unlike other psychoactive drugs such as [[stimulants]] and [[opioids]], hallucinogens do not merely amplify familiar states of mind but also induce experiences that differ from those of ordinary consciousness, often compared to non-ordinary forms of consciousness such as [[trance]], [[meditation]], conversion experiences, and [[dream]]s.  . 

Psychedelics, dissociatives, and deliriants have a long worldwide history of use within medicinal and religious traditions. They are used in [[shamanic]] forms of ritual [[healing]] and [[divination]], in [[initiation rites]], and in the religious rituals of [[syncretistic]] movements such as [[União do Vegetal]], [[Santo Daime]], and the [[Native American Church]]. When used in religious practice, psychedelic drugs, as well as other substances like [[tobacco]], are referred to as [[entheogens]].  . 

Starting in the mid-20th century, psychedelic drugs have been the object of extensive attention in the Western world. They have been and are being explored as potential therapeutic agents in treating [[clinical depression|depression]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[Obsessive-compulsive disorder]], [[alcoholism]], and [[opioid addiction]]. Yet the most popular, and at the same time most stigmatized, use of psychedelics in Western culture has been associated with the search for direct [[religious experience]], enhanced [[creativity]], personal development, and "mind expansion". The use of psychedelic drugs was a major element of the 1960s [[counterculture]], where it became associated with various social movements and a general atmosphere of rebellion and strife between generations.

====Stimulants====. 
[[Stimulant]]s, also known as "psychostimulants",<ref name="dorlands">{{cite web |url=http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands_split.jsp?pg=/ppdocs/us/common/dorlands/dorland/seven/000088218.htm |title=Dorlands Medical Dictionary:psychostimulant}}</ref> induce [[euphoria]] with improvements in mental and physical function, such as enhanced alertness, wakefulness, and locomotion. Due to their effects typically having an "up" quality to them, stimulants are also occasionally referred to as "uppers". [[Depressant]]s or "downers", which decrease mental and/or physical function, are in stark contrast to stimulants and are considered to be their functional opposites.  . 

Stimulants enhance the activity of the [[central nervous system|central]] and [[peripheral nervous system]]s. Common effects may include increased [[alertness]], [[awareness]], [[wakefulness]], [[endurance]], [[productivity]], and [[motivation]], [[arousal]], [[animal locomotion|locomotion]], [[heart rate]], and [[blood pressure]], and a diminished desire for [[food]] and [[sleep]].  . 

Use of stimulants may cause the body to reduce significantly its production of natural body chemicals that fulfill similar functions. Until the body reestablishes its normal state, once the effect of the ingested stimulant has worn off the user may feel depressed, lethargic, confused, and miserable. This is referred to as a "crash", and may provoke reuse of the stimulant.  . 

Examples include:
* [[Sympathomimetic]]s ([[catecholaminergic]]s) &mdash; e.g. amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, [[methylphenidate]], [[ephedrine]], [[pseudoephedrine]]
* [[Entactogen]]s ([[serotonergic]]s, primarily phenethylamines) &mdash; e.g. [[MDMA]]

===Inhalants===. 
[[Inhalants]] are [[gas]]es, [[aerosol]]s, or solvents that are breathed in and absorbed through the lungs. While some "inhalant" drugs are used for [[List of medical inhalants|medical purposes]], as in the case of nitrous oxide, a dental anesthetic, inhalants are used as [[recreational drug]]s for their intoxicating effect. Most inhalant drugs that are used non-medically are ingredients in household or industrial chemical products that are not intended to be concentrated and inhaled, including organic [[solvent]]s (found in cleaning products, fast-drying glues, and [[nail polish]] removers), fuels ([[gasoline]] (petrol) and [[kerosene]]), and propellant gases such as [[Freon]] and compressed [[hydrofluorocarbon]]s that are used in aerosol cans such as hairspray, whipped cream, and non-stick cooking spray. A small number of recreational inhalant drugs are pharmaceutical products that are used illicitly, such as anesthetics (ether and nitrous oxide) and volatile anti-[[angina pectoris|angina]] drugs ([[poppers|alkyl nitrites]]).  . 

The most serious inhalant abuse occurs among children and teens who "[...] live on the streets completely without family ties."<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.drugabuse.gov/pdf/monographs/148.pdf Epidemiology of Inhalant Abuse: An International Perspective, 148<!--Bot generated title-->]</ref> Inhalant users inhale [[vapor]] or aerosol propellant gases using plastic bags held over the mouth or by breathing from a solvent-soaked rag or an open container. The effects of inhalants range from an alcohol-like intoxication and intense euphoria to vivid [[hallucination]]s, depending on the substance and the dosage. Some inhalant users are injured due to the harmful effects of the solvents or gases, or due to other chemicals used in the products that they are inhaling. As with any recreational drug, users can be injured due to dangerous behavior while they are intoxicated, such as driving under the influence. Computer cleaning dusters are dangerous to inhale, because the gases expand and cool rapidly upon being sprayed. In some cases, users have died from [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] (lack of oxygen), pneumonia, cardiac failure or arrest,<ref name="gdcada.org">http://www.gdcada.org/statistics/inhalants.htm</ref> or aspiration of vomit.  . 

Examples include: . 

* [[chloroform]]
* diethyl ether
* [[laughing gas]] ([[nitrous oxide]])
* [[Poppers]] ([[alkyl nitrite]]s)
* [[solvent]]s and [[propellant]]s (including [[propane]], [[butane]], [[freon]], [[gasoline]], [[kerosene]], [[toluene]]) and the [[fumes]] of [[glue]]s containing them .

===Australia===. 
:''See also'': [[Illicit drug use in Australia]]
Marijuana is the most popular drug in Australia tried by more than 7 million Australians in a lifetime, with ecstasy being the second most popular tried by 2 million people. By age 20, 37% of the population have tried illicit drugs, and by age 40, this is just shy of 60%. <ref>{{cite news|title=The great debate that no one's talking about|date=December 3, 2011|work=Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/the-great-debate-that-no-ones-talking-about-20111203-1ocag.html|accessdate=3 December 2011}}</ref> . 

===Ireland===. 
:''See also'': [[Illicit drug use in Ireland]]
A 2008 study in the [[Republic of Ireland]] found that for teenagers aged 15–19:<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0523/drugs.html RTÉ News - Half of young people use drink, drugs]</ref>
* 86% drink alcohol (the legal alcohol purchase age and public [[legal drinking age|drinking age]] is 18.)
** 51% [[binge drink]] (defined as five drinks or more at occasion) at least once a month. 
** 19% binge drink once a week. 
** On a typical drinking occasion, the average amount of alcoholic beverages consumed is 5.75 pints. 
** The average age for taking a first alcoholic drink is 13½. 
* 50% have used illegal drugs at least once. 
** 41% have used cannabis at least once. 
** The average age of first illegal drug use is 14½.  . 

[[Northern Ireland]] has the highest rate of recreational drug use among teenagers in the [[European Union]]. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/8265831.stm | work=BBC News | title=NI child drug use 'highest in EU' | date=2009-09-21 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref> . 

===United States===. 
Since 1937, 20% to 37% of the youth in the United States have used cannabis. One in four high school seniors has used the drug in the past month; one in ten 8th-graders has done so. <ref>[http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/History/whiteb1.htm Charles Whitebread: The History of the Non-Medical Use of Drugs in the United States]</ref>{{Update after|2010|11|13}} In the 1960s, the number of Americans who had tried cannabis at least once increased over twentyfold. <ref name=inciardi>{{cite book |last=Inciardi |first=James A. |title=The War on Drugs II |publisher=Mayfield Publishing Company |year=1992 |page=42 |isbn=1-55934-016-9}}</ref> Between 1972 and 1988, the use of cocaine increased more than fivefold. <ref>[http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR331/ Controlling Cocaine: Supply Versus Demand Programs]</ref> The usage pattern of methamphetamine is significantly dropping in teens, and the usage pattern of ecstasy is not currently rising.  . 

==Movements==. 
There have been many movements calling for the legalization of recreational drugs (the most notable one being cannabis). Examples of such movements are the [[Worldwide Marijuana March]], Hemp Day, and 4/20. Several movements that call for the legalization of drugs, not from an argument of their safety but rather from an argument that this issue should be considered a medical one and not a criminal one, also exist, primarily in North America. One such organization is the [[Students for Sensible Drug Policy]] (SSDP). The British drug reform group Transform believes that taxation and regulation of drugs by the government would significantly decrease crime while increasing the health of drug users and addicts. <ref>http://www.tdpf.org.uk/Policy_General_AftertheWaronDrugsReport.htm</ref> Impact varies from country to country, depending on its legality. Also, there are many anti-drug movements, specifically [[Straight Edge]] and The Partnership For A Drug Free America, calling for the continuation of its current illegality.  . 

In a blog article titled "Drugs and the meaning of life", author and neuroscientist [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] argues ''"The fact that we pointlessly ruin the lives of nonviolent drug users by incarcerating them, at enormous expense, constitutes one of the great moral failures of our time.''" He says that he dreads the thought of his daughter's ever taking an interest in crack cocaine. On the other hand, he feels that she might be missing out if she never tried [[psychedelics]] like psilocybin. Harris also laments that a drug's legality, social status, and risks of harm rarely correlate reasonably. <ref>[http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/drugs-and-the-meaning-of-life/ samharris.org, blog, "Drugs and the meaning of life".]</ref> . 

==Risks and harm==. 
[[File:HarmCausedByDrugsTable.svg|thumb|When overall harm to society and the drug user are considered together, alcohol is by far the most damaging (despite being legal more often than the other drugs)]]
The amount and type of risks that come with recreational drug use vary widely with the drug. There are many factors in the environment and the user that interact with each drug differently. Overall, some studies suggest that alcohol is one of the most dangerous of all recreational drugs; only heroin, crack cocaine, and methamphetamines are judged to be more harmful. Experts in the UK offer that some drugs that may be causing less harm, to fewer users (although they are also used less frequently in the first place) include psilocybin mushrooms, LSD, and ecstasy. These drugs are not without their own particular risks. <ref>[http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2010/11/drugs_cause_most_harm "Drug harms in the UK: a multi-criteria decision analysis", by David Nutt, Leslie King and Lawrence Phillips, on behalf of the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs. The Lancet.]</ref> .
