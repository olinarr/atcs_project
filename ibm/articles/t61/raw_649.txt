'''Substance abuse''', also known as '''[[drug abuse]]''', refers to a maladaptive pattern of use of a substance (drug) that is not considered dependent. {{vague|date=November 2011}}   Substance abuse/drug abuse is not limited to mood-altering or psycho-active drugs.  Activity is also considered substance abuse when inappropriately used (as in steroids for performance enhancement in sports).  Therefore, mood-altering and psychoactive substances are not the only drugs of abuse.  Substance abuse often includes problems with impulse control and impulsivity.  . 

The term "drug abuse" does not exclude dependency, but is otherwise used in a similar manner in nonmedical contexts. The terms have a huge range of definitions related to taking a [[psychoactive drug]] or [[performance enhancing drug]] for a non-therapeutic or non-medical effect. All of these definitions imply a negative judgment of the drug use in question (compare with the term [[responsible drug use]] for alternative views). Some of the drugs most often associated with this term include [[Ethanol|alcohol]], [[amphetamines]], [[barbiturate]]s, [[benzodiazepine]]s (particularly [[temazepam]], [[nimetazepam]], and [[flunitrazepam]]), [[cocaine]], [[methaqualone]], and [[opioids]]. Use of these drugs may lead to criminal penalty in addition to possible physical, social, and psychological harm, both strongly depending on local jurisdiction. <ref name="mosby">(2002). ''Mosby's Medical, Nursing, & Allied Health Dictionary''. Sixth Edition. Drug abuse definition, p. 552. Nursing diagnoses, p. 2109. ISBN 0-323-01430-5. </ref>  Other definitions of drug abuse fall into four main categories: public health definitions, mass communication and vernacular usage, medical definitions, and political and criminal justice definitions.  . 

Substance abuse is a form of [[substance-related disorder]].  . 

==Classification==. 
===Public health definitions===. 
[[File:Spectrum Diagram.PNG|thumb|Source: [http://www.cfdp.ca/bchoc.pdf A Public Health Approach to Drug Control in Canada, Health Officers Council of British Columbia, 2005]]]
[[Public health]] practitioners have attempted to look at drug abuse from a broader perspective than the individual, emphasizing the role of society, culture and availability. Rather than accepting the loaded terms alcohol or drug "abuse," many public health professionals have adopted phrases such as "substance and alcohol type problems" or "harmful/problematic use" of drugs.  . 

The Health Officers Council of [[British Columbia]] — in their 2005 policy discussion paper, ''[http://www.cfdp.ca/bchoc.pdf A Public Health Approach to Drug Control in Canada]'' — has adopted a public health model of psychoactive substance use that challenges the simplistic black-and-white construction of the binary (or complementary) [[antonym]]s "use" vs. "abuse". This model explicitly recognizes a spectrum of use, ranging from beneficial use to [[Substance dependence|chronic dependence]] (see diagram to the right).  . 

===Medical definitions===. 
In the modern medical profession, the three most used diagnostic tools in the world, the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM),the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and ICRIS Medical organization Related Health Problems]] (ICD), no longer recognize 'drug abuse' as a current medical diagnosis. Instead, DSM has adopted ''substance abuse''<ref name = "DSM4"/> as a blanket term to include drug abuse and other things. ICD refrains from using either "substance abuse" or "drug abuse", instead using the term "harmful use" to cover physical or psychological harm to the user from use. Physical dependence, abuse of, and withdrawal from drugs and other miscellaneous substances is outlined in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) ). Its section [[Substance dependence]] begins with:
::''"'''Substance dependence''' When an individual persists in use of alcohol or other drugs despite problems related to use of the substance, [[substance dependence]] may be diagnosed. Compulsive and repetitive use may result in tolerance to the effect of the drug and withdrawal symptoms when use is reduced or stopped. These, along with Substance Abuse are considered Substance Use Disorders...."'' <ref name = "DSM4"/> . 

However, other definitions differ; they may entail psychological or physical ''[[substance dependence|dependence]]'',<ref name="DSM4">[http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/subdep.htm DSM-IV & DSM-IV-TR:Substance Dependence]</ref> and may focus on treatment and prevention in terms of the social consequences of substance uses.  . 

===Drug misuse===. 
Drug misuse is a term used commonly for [[prescription medication]]s with clinical efficacy but abuse potential and known adverse effects linked to improper use, such as psychiatric medications with [[sedative]], [[anxiolytic]], [[analgesic]], or [[stimulant]] properties. Prescription misuse has been variably and inconsistently defined based on drug prescription status, the uses that occur without a prescription, intentional use to achieve intoxicating effects, route of administration, co-ingestion with [[alcohol]], and the presence or absence of abuse or dependence symptoms. <ref name=misuse>{{Cite journal|author=Barrett SP, Meisner JR, Stewart SH |title=What constitutes prescription drug misuse?

Canada: Thompson Delmar Learning</ref> . 

===As a value judgment===. 
[[File:HarmCausedByDrugsTable.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Legal drugs are not necessarily safer. A study in 2010 asked drug-harm experts to rank various illegal and legal drugs. Alcohol was found to be the most dangerous by far.]] [[Philip Jenkins]] points out that there are two issues with the term "drug abuse". First, what constitutes a "drug" is debatable. For instance, [[Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]], a naturally occurring substance in the central nervous system is considered a drug, and is illegal in many countries, while [[nicotine]] is not officially considered a drug in most countries. Second, the word "abuse" implies a recognized standard of use for any substance. Drinking an occasional glass of wine is considered acceptable in most Western countries, while drinking several bottles is seen as an abuse. Strict temperance advocates, which may or may not be religiously motivated, would see drinking even one glass as an abuse, and some groups even condemn [[caffeine]] use in any quantity. Similarly, adopting the view that any (recreational) use of [[marijuana]] or [[amphetamines]] constitutes drug abuse implies that we have already decided that the substance is harmful, even in minute quantities. <ref>Philip Jenkins, ''Synthetic panics: the symbolic politics of designer drugs'', NYU Press, 1999, ISBN 0-8147-4244-0, pp. ix-x</ref> . 

==Signs and symptoms==. 
Depending on the actual compound, drug abuse including alcohol may lead to health problems, [[social problems]], [[morbidity]], [[injuries]], [[unprotected sex]], [[violence]], [[deaths]], [[motor vehicle accidents]], [[homicides]], [[suicides]], [[physical dependence]] or [[Substance dependence|psychological addiction]]. <ref>{{Cite journal|author=Burke PJ, O'Sullivan J, Vaughan BL |title=Adolescent substance use: brief interventions by emergency care providers |journal=Pediatr Emerg Care |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=770–6 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16280955 |doi= |url=}}</ref> . 

There is a high rate of suicide in [[alcoholics]] and other drug abusers. The reasons believed to cause the increased risk of suicide include the [[long-term abuse of alcohol]] and other drugs causing physiological distortion of brain chemistry as well as the social isolation. Another factor is the acute intoxicating effects of the drugs may make suicide more likely to occur. Suicide is also very common in [[adolescent]] alcohol abusers, with 1 in 4 suicides in adolescents being related to alcohol abuse. <ref name="understanding_suicidal_behaviour_a02">{{Cite book| last1 = O'Connor | first1 = Rory | last2 = Sheehy | first2 = Noel | title = Understanding suicidal behaviour | url = http://books.google.com/?id=79hEYGdDA3oC | date = 29 January 2000 | publisher = BPS Books | location = Leicester | isbn = 978-1-85433-290-5 | pages = 33–36 }}</ref> In the USA approximately 30 percent of suicides are related to alcohol abuse. Alcohol abuse is also associated with increased risks of committing criminal offences including [[child abuse]], [[domestic violence]], [[rapes]], [[burglaries]] and [[assaults]]. <ref name="drug_use_a_reference_handbook">{{Cite book| last1 = Isralowitz | first1 = Richard | title = Drug use: a reference handbook | url = http://books.google.com/?id=X0mxxfbIbp4C | year = 2004 | publisher = ABC-CLIO | location = Santa Barbara, Calif. | isbn = 978-1-57607-708-5 | pages = 122–123}}</ref> . 

Drug abuse, including alcohol and prescription drugs can induce symptomatology which resembles mental illness. This can occur both in the intoxicated state and also during the [[withdrawal]] state. In some cases these substance induced psychiatric disorders can persist long after detoxification, such as prolonged psychosis or [[major depression|depression]] after amphetamine or cocaine abuse. A [[protracted withdrawal syndrome]] can also occur with symptoms persisting for months after cessation of use. [[Benzodiazepines]] are the most notable drug for inducing prolonged withdrawal effects with symptoms sometimes persisting for years after cessation of use. Abuse of [[hallucinogens]] can trigger delusional and other psychotic phenomena long after cessation of use and [[cannabis]] may trigger panic attacks during intoxication and with use it may cause a state similar to [[dysthymia]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. Severe anxiety and depression are commonly induced by sustained alcohol abuse which in most cases abates with prolonged abstinence. Even moderate alcohol sustained use may increase anxiety and depression levels in some individuals. In most cases these drug induced psychiatric disorders fade away with prolonged abstinence. <ref>{{Cite book|last1=Evans |first1=Katie |last2=Sullivan |first2=Michael J. |title=Dual Diagnosis: Counseling the Mentally Ill Substance Abuser |url=http://books.google.com/?id=lvUzR0obihEC |edition=2nd |date=1 March 2001 |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-57230-446-8 |pages=75–76 |chapter= |chapterurl= }}</ref> . 

Drug abuse makes [[central nervous system]] (CNS) effects, which produce changes in mood, levels of awareness or perceptions and sensations. Most of these drugs also alter systems other than the CNS. Some of these are often thought of as being abused. Some drugs appear to be more likely to lead to uncontrolled use than others. <ref name="jaffe">Jaffe, J.H. (1975). Drug addiction and drug abuse. In L.S. Goodman & A. Gilman (Eds.) ''The pharmacological basis of therapeutics (5th ed.)''. New York: MacMillan. pp. 284–324. </ref> . 

Traditionally, new pharmacotherapies are quickly adopted in primary care settings, however; drugs for substance abuse treatment have faced many barriers. [[Naltrexone]], a drug originally marketed under the name "ReVia," and now marketed in intramuscular formulation as "Vivitrol" or in oral formulation as a generic, is a medication approved for the treatment of alcohol dependence.  This drug has reached very few patients. This may be due to a number of factors, including resistance by [[Addiction Medicine]] specialists and lack of resources. <ref name="bcsse">Board on Behavioral, Cognitive, and Sensory Sciences and Education (BCSSE).(2004)  ''[http://www.nap.edu/books/0309091284/html/ New Treatments for Addiction: Behavioral, Ethical, Legal, and Social Questions]''. The National Academies Press. pp. 7–8, 140–141</ref> . 

The ability to recognize the signs of drug use or the symptoms of drug use in family members by parents and spouses has been affected significantly by the emergence of [[home drug test]] technology which helps identify recent use of common street and prescription drugs with near lab quality accuracy.  .

The initiation of drug and alcohol use is most likely to occur during adolescence, and some experimentation with substances by older adolescents is common. For example, results from 2010 [[Monitoring the Future]] survey, a nationwide study on rates of substance use in the United States, show that 48.2% of 12th graders report having used an illicit drug at some point in their lives. <ref name=MTF2010/> In the 30 days prior to the survey, 41.2% of 12th graders had consumed alcohol and 19.2% of 12th graders had smoked [[tobacco cigarette]]s. <ref name=MTF2010> Johnston, L. D., O’Malley, P. M., Bachman, J. G., & Schulenberg, J. E. (2011).

Studies have shown that the large majority of adolescents will phase out of drug use before it becomes problematic. Thus, although rates of overall use are high, the percentage of adolescents who meet criteria for substance abuse is significantly lower (close to 5%).{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} According to BBC, "Worldwide, the UN estimates there are more than 50 million regular users of morphine diacetate (heroin), cocaine and synthetic drugs."<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/world/2000/drugs_trade/default.stm Drug Trade]".

==History==. 
===APA, AMA, and NCDA=== . 

In 1932, the American Psychiatric Association created a definition that used legality, social acceptability, and cultural familiarity as qualifying factors:
{{quote|…as a general rule, we reserve the term drug abuse to apply to the illegal, nonmedical use of a limited number of substances, most of them drugs, which have properties of altering the mental state in ways that are considered by social norms and defined by statute to be inappropriate, undesirable, harmful, threatening, or, at minimum, culture-alien."}}<ref>Glasscote, R.M., Sussex, J.N., Jaffe, J.H., Ball, J., Brill, L. (1932). '''''The Treatment of Drug Abuse for people like you...:''' Programs, Problems, Prospects''. Washington, D.C.: Joint Information Service of the American Psychiatric Association and the National Association for Mental Health. </ref> . 

In 1966, the [[American Medical Association]]'s Committee on Alcoholism and Addiction defined abuse of stimulants (amphetamines, primarily) in terms of 'medical supervision':
{{quote|…'use' refers to the proper place of stimulants in medical practice; 'misuse' applies to the physician's role in initiating a potentially dangerous course of therapy; and 'abuse' refers to self-administration of these drugs without medical supervision and particularly in large doses that may lead to psychological dependency, tolerance and abnormal behavior.}} . 

In 1973, the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse stated:
<blockquote>...drug abuse may refer to any type of drug or chemical without regard to its pharmacologic actions. It is an eclectic concept having only one uniform connotation: societal disapproval. ... The Commission believes that the term drug abuse must be deleted from official pronouncements and public policy dialogue. The term has no functional utility and has become no more than an arbitrary codeword for that drug use which is presently considered wrong. <ref>Second Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse; Drug Use In America: Problem In Perspective (March 1973), p.13</ref></blockquote> . 

===DSM===. 
The first edition of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (published in 1952) grouped alcohol and drug abuse under Sociopathic Personality Disturbances, which were thought to be symptoms of deeper psychological disorders or moral weakness.  . 

The third edition, published in 1980, was the first to recognize substance abuse (including drug abuse) and substance dependence as conditions separate from substance abuse alone, bringing in social and cultural factors. The definition of dependence emphasised tolerance to drugs, and withdrawal from them as key components to diagnosis, whereas abuse was defined as "problematic use with social or occupational impairment" but without withdrawal or tolerance.  . 

In 1987, the [[DSM-III]]R category "psychoactive substance abuse," which includes former concepts of drug abuse is defined as "a maladaptive pattern of use indicated by...continued use despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent social, occupational, psychological or physical problem that is caused or exacerbated by the use (or by) recurrent use in situations in which it is physically hazardous." It is a residual category, with dependence taking precedence when applicable. It was the first definition to give equal weight to behavioural and physiological factors in diagnosis.  . 

By 1988, the DSM-IV defines substance dependence as "a syndrome involving compulsive use, with or without tolerance and withdrawal"; whereas substance abuse is "problematic use without compulsive use, significant tolerance, or withdrawal." Substance abuse can be harmful to your health and may even be deadly in certain scenarios . 

By 1994, The fourth edition of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM) issued by the [[American Psychiatric Association]], the DSM-IV-TR, defines substance dependence as "when an individual persists in use of alcohol or other drugs despite problems related to use of the substance, [[substance dependence]] may be diagnosed."  followed by criteria for the diagnose<ref name="DSM4"/> . 

DSM-IV-TR defines substance abuse as:<ref name="fn_3">American Psychiatric Association (1994). ''Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders'' (4th edition). Washington, DC. </ref> . 

:*A. A maladaptive pattern of substance use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by one (or more) of the following, occurring within a 12-month period:
::#Recurrent substance use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home (e.g., repeated absences or poor work performance related to substance use; substance-related absences, suspensions or expulsions from school; neglect of children or household)
::#Recurrent substance use in situations in which it is physically hazardous (e.g., driving an automobile or operating a machine when impaired by substance use)
::#Recurrent substance-related legal problems (e.g., arrests for substance-related disorderly conduct)
::#Continued substance use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the substance (e.g., arguments with spouse about consequences of intoxication, physical fights)
:*B. The symptoms have never met the criteria for Substance Dependence for this class of substance.  . 

The fifth edition of the DSM ([[DSM-5]]), planned for release in 2013, is likely to have this terminology revisited yet again. Under consideration is a transition from the abuse/dependence terminology. At the moment, abuse is seen as an early form or less hazardous form of the disease characterized with the dependence criteria. However, the APA's 'dependence' term, as noted above, does not mean that physiologic dependence is present but rather means that a disease state is present, one that most would likely refer to as an addicted state. Many involved recognize that the terminology has often led to confusion, both within the medical community and with the general public. The American Psychiatric Association requests input as to how the terminology of this illness should be altered as it moves forward with DSM-5 discussion.  . 

==Society and culture==. 
===Legal approaches===. 
:''Related articles: [[Drug control law]], [[Prohibition (drugs)]], [[Arguments for and against drug prohibition]]'' . 

Most governments have designed [[legislation]] to criminalize certain types of drug use. These drugs are often called "illegal drugs" but generally what is illegal is their [[license|unlicensed]] production, distribution, and possession. These drugs are also called "controlled substances".  Even for simple possession, legal punishment can be quite severe (including the [[death penalty]] in some countries). Laws vary across countries, and even within them, and have fluctuated widely throughout history.  . 

Attempts by government-sponsored drug control policy to interdict drug supply and eliminate drug abuse have been largely unsuccessful. 
In spite of the huge efforts by the U.S., drug supply and purity has reached an all time high, with the vast majority of resources spent on interdiction and law enforcement instead of [[public health]]. <ref>{{Cite journal|author=Copeman M |title=Drug supply and drug abuse |journal=CMAJ |volume=168 |issue=9 |pages=1113; author reply 1113 |year=2003 |month=April |pmid=12719309 |pmc=153673 |doi= |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12719309}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Wood E, Tyndall MW, Spittal PM, ''et al.'' |title=Impact of supply-side policies for control of illicit drugs in the face of the AIDS and overdose epidemics: investigation of a massive heroin seizure |journal=CMAJ |volume=168 |issue=2 |pages=165–9 |year=2003 |month=January |pmid=12538544 |doi= |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12538544 |pmc=140425}}</ref>  In the [[United States]], the number of nonviolent drug offenders in prison exceeds by 100,000 the total incarcerated population in the [[EU]], despite the fact that the EU has 100 million more citizens.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} . 

Despite drug legislation (or perhaps because of it), large, organized criminal [[drug cartel]]s operate worldwide. Advocates of decriminalization argue that drug prohibition makes drug dealing a lucrative business, leading to much of the associated criminal activity.  . 

===Cost=== . 

It is important to obtain estimates of the costs of problems stemming from substance abuse. In order to make informed decisions when allocating scarce resources, policymakers must have a sound understanding of the relative costs of drug-related interventions. Other things being equal, the lower the cost, the more cost-effective a program or intervention will be, or the higher the net economic benefits it will generate. An appropriate drug policy relies on the assessment of drug related public expenditure on efficiency grounds. This is not feasible without giving a preliminary clear and well-defined classification system where costs are properly identified.  . 

Labelled drug-related expenditures are defined as the direct ex-ante planned spending that reflects the voluntary engagement of the state in the field of illicit drugs. Direct public expenditures explicitly labeled as drug-related can be easily traced back by exhaustively reviewing official accountancy documents such as national budgets and year-end reports. Unlabelled expenditure refers to unplanned spending and is estimated through modeling techniques, based on a top-down budgetary procedure. Starting from overall aggregated expenditures, this procedure estimates the proportion causally attributable to substance abuse (Unlabelled Drug-related Expenditure = Overall Expenditure × Attributable Proportion). For example, to estimate the prison drug-related expenditures in a given country, two elements would be necessary: the overall prison expenditures in the country for a given fiscal year, and the attributable proportion of inmates due to drug-related issues. The product of the two will give a rough estimate that can be compared across different countries. <ref name=Prieto/> . 

====Europe==== . 

As part of the reporting exercise corresponding to 2005, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction's network of national focal points set up in the 27 European Union (EU) Member States, Norway, and the candidates countries to the EU, were requested to identify labeled drug-related public expenditure, at the country level. <ref name=Prieto/> . 

This was reported by 10 countries categorized according to the functions of government, amounting to a total of EUR 2.17 billion. Overall, the highest proportion of this total came within the government functions of Health (66%) (e.g. medical services), and Public Order and Safety (POS) (20%) (e.g. police services, law courts, prisons). By country, the average share of GDP was 0.023% for Health, and 0.013% for POS. However, these shares varied considerably across countries, ranging from 0.00033% in Slovakia, up to 0.053% of GDP in Ireland in the case of Health, and from 0.003% in Portugal, to 0.02% in the UK, in the case of POS; almost a 161-fold difference between the highest and the lowest countries for Health, and a 6-fold difference for POS. Why do Ireland and the UK spend so much in Health and POS, or Slovakia and Portugal so little, in GDP terms? . 

To respond to this question and to make a comprehensive assessment of drug-related public expenditure across countries, this study compared Health and POS spending and GDP in the 10 reporting countries. Results found suggest GDP to be a major determinant of the Health and POS drug-related public expenditures of a country. Labelled drug-related public expenditure showed a positive association with the GDP across the countries considered: r = 0.81 in the case of Health, and r = 0.91 for POS. The percentage change in Health and POS expenditures due to a one percent increase in GDP (the income elasticity of demand) was estimated to be 1.78% and 1.23% respectively.  . 

Being highly income elastic, Health and POS expenditures can be considered luxury goods; as a nation becomes wealthier it openly spends proportionately more on drug-related health and public order and safety interventions. <ref name=Prieto>Prieto L.

==Treatment==. 
Treatment for substance abuse is critical for many around the world. Often a formal intervention is necessary to convince the substance abuser to submit to any form of treatment. Behavioral interventions and medications exist that have helped many people reduce, or discontinue, their substance abuse. From the [[applied behavior analysis]] literature, [[behavioral psychology]], and from randomized [[clinical trials]], several evidenced based interventions have emerged:
* [[Integrative behavioral couples therapy|Behavioral Marital Therapy]]
* [[Motivational Interviewing]]
