'''Gene doping''' is defined by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] as "the non-therapeutic use of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, [[genes]], genetic elements, or of the modulation of [[gene expression]], having the capacity to improve athletic performance". [http://www.wada-ama.org/rtecontent/document/2008_List_En.pdf] A complex [[ethical]] and [[philosophical]] issue is what defines "gene doping", especially in the context of [[bioethical]] debates about [[human enhancement]]. <ref name="Miah 2004">{{cite book| author = [[Andy Miah|Miah, Andy]]| title = Genetically Modified Athletes: Biomedical Ethics, Gene Doping and Sport| publisher = Routledge| year = 2004| isbn = 0-415-29880-6}}</ref>  The idea stems from research done in the 1970s to treat human diseases by fixing the underlying genes. <ref>FRIEDMANN, THEODORE. 2010. How close are we to gene doping? Hastings Center Report 40, (2) (03): 20-2, http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=aph&AN=49164747&site=ehost-live. </ref>
An example of gene doping could involve the recreational use of [[gene therapy|gene therapies]] intended to treat muscle-wasting disorders.  Other applications include increasing muscle growth, blood production, endurance, oxygen dispersal and pain perception.  Many of these chemicals may be indistinguishable from their natural counterparts. In such cases, nothing unusual would enter the [[bloodstream]] so officials would detect nothing in a [[blood test|blood]] or [[urine test]]. <ref>Barry, Patrick. 2008. Finding the golden genes. Science News 174, (3) (Aug. 2): 16-21, http://www.jstor.org/stable/20494726. </ref> Other more invasive tests would still most likely be unable to detect the foreign gene. The new gene may be identical to the natural gene and may not be in every cell of the body. Some viruses target certain organs, such as the kidney or liver, thus only samples taken from these areas could lead to detection. <ref>A case in gene doping: Repoxygen. (cover story). 2008.

The historical development of policy associated with gene doping began in 2001 when the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) Medical Commission met to discuss the implications of gene therapy for sport.  It was shortly followed by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA), which met in 2002 to discuss genetic enhancement at [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] in New York.  Also in 2002, the United States [[The President's Council on Bioethics|President’s Council on Bioethics]] met twice to discuss the ethics of genetic technology related to sport. In 2003, WADA decided to include a prohibition of gene doping within their [[World Anti-Doping Code]], which is formalized in its 2004 World Anti-Doping Code.  Further, the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) met in 2003 and 2004 to discuss the science and ethics of gene transfer technology for sport.  . 

The [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) has already asked scientists to help find ways to prevent gene therapy from becoming the newest means of doping. In December 2005, the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] hosted its second landmark meeting on gene doping, which took place in Stockholm. At this meeting, the delegates drafted a declaration on gene doping which, for the first time, included a strong discouragement of the use of genetic testing for performance. In September 2010 a WADA funded research project reported for the first time that the direct and long-term detection of gene doping by the abuse of gene transfer techniques is possible in conventional blood samples. <ref>http://www.nature.com/gt/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/gt2010122a.html</ref>  . 

The first product to be associated with genetic doping emerged on the approach to the [[2006 Winter Olympics|Turin 2006 Olympic Winter Games]], where [[repoxygen]] was discussed as a possible substance in use at the Games.  .

"The transfer of cells or genetic elements or the use of cells, genetic elements or pharmacological agents to modulating expression of endogenous genes having the capacity to enhance athletic performance, is prohibited” .
