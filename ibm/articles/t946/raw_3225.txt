[[File:2010 BCS Champ.jpg|thumb|260px|50-yard line action for the national championship in Pasadena California, January 7, 2010]]  . 

The '''BCS National Championship Game''', or '''BCS National Championship''', is the final [[bowl game]] of the annual [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS) and is intended by the organizers of the BCS to determine the U.S. [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national champion]] of the [[Football Bowl Subdivision|NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]] (formerly known as NCAA Division I-A). The participants are the two highest-ranked teams in the BCS standings at the end of the regular [[college football]] season, currently determined by averaging the results of the final weekly [[Coaches' Poll|''USA Today'' Coaches' Poll]], [[Harris Interactive Poll]] of media, former players and coaches, and the average of six participating [[Sports rating system|computer rankings]].  . 

Since the formation of the [[Bowl Championship Series]], there have been several controversies regarding the schools selected to participate in the BCS National Championship Game. Most notably, following the [[2003 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2003]] season, the [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] ranking system selected the #3 ranked school in the [[AP Poll#College football|Associated Press writers' poll]], the [[2003 Oklahoma Sooners football team|University of Oklahoma]], over the #1 ranked school in that poll, the [[2003 USC Trojans football team|University of Southern California]], to participate in the National Championship Game (the [[2004 Sugar Bowl|Nokia Sugar Bowl]]) despite Oklahoma's decisive loss to [[2003 Kansas State Wildcats football team|Kansas State]] in the [[2003 Big 12 Championship Game]]. 2003 is the only season, to date, since the inception of the BCS in which the national championship has been split, with [[2003 LSU Tigers football team|Louisiana State University]] winning the BCS national championship and the University of Southern California winning the [[AP National Championship Trophy|AP national championship]] and the [[Grantland Rice Award|FWAA national championship]].  . 

The [[2012 BCS National Championship Game|BCS National Championship]] for the [[2011 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2011]] season at the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]] in [[New Orleans, LA]] was held on January 9, 2012, sponsored by [[Allstate]], and televised on the [[ESPN]] television network. The [[2011 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama Crimson Tide]] defeated the [[2011 LSU Tigers football team|LSU Tigers]] 21-0 in the first shutout in BCS National Championship history. The game was also the  first time that two teams from the same conference (and also from the same division of the same conference) met for the BCS National Championship.  . 

==History==. 
{{expand section|date=November 2010}}
The first BCS Championship Game was played at the conclusion of the [[1998 NCAA Division I-A football season|1998 college football season]] in accordance with an agreement by the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] Conference, the  [[Pac-12|Pac-10 (now Pac-12)]] Conference, and the [[Rose Bowl Game]] to join the  "[[Bowl Alliance]]" system.  The expanded format was called the [[Bowl Championship Series]].  . 

The Bowl Alliance and its predecessor, the [[Bowl Coalition]], featured championship games from 1992 through 1997. However, these did not ensure a matchup between the top two ranked teams because of the lack of participation by the Big Ten and Pac-10.  Presentation of the crystal football trophy, first awarded at the end of the 1992 season, continues to be awarded to the BCS National Championship Game winner.  . 

The BCS National Championship Game was initially rotated among the four participating bowl games: the (Rose Bowl, [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]], [[Fiesta Bowl]], and [[Sugar Bowl]]).  However, beginning with the [[2006 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2006 season]], the BCS National Championship Game became a separate bowl game unto itself, following New Year's Day.  The BCS National Championship Game rotates its location among the Orange, Sugar, Fiesta, and Rose Bowl venues; however, the BCS National Championship Game is not coupled with those Bowls. For example, the 2011 Fiesta Bowl was a separate event from the 2011 BCS National Championship Game.  .

==Criticisms and controversy==. 
{{Main|College football playoff debate|BCS controversies}}
{{criticism section|date=November 2010}} . 

Critics of the current BCS championship argue against the [[internal validity]] of the current BCS ''National Championship'', which is awarded to the winner of a single postseason game, the BCS National Championship game. Critics lament that the participants in this game are decided based upon polls and computers; not by previous on-field competition as is this the case in other major sports and other levels of college football which employ playoff format championships. Often, the BCS system leads to controversies in which multiple teams finish seasons with equal records, and voters must distinguish the worthiness of their participation in the BCS National Championship game. Without providing any objective criteria for evaluation of these teams, the BCS also forces voters to impose their own standards and tiebreakers. Critics note that the system inherently fosters [[selection bias]], and therefore, lacks [[external validity]]. <ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=forde_pat&id=3403542&sportCat=ncf Eight-team playoff would be ideal for college football – columnist – ESPN]. Sports.espn.go.com (2008-05-20). Retrieved on 2010-11-21. </ref> . 

Controversies concerning inclusion in the BCS National Championship Game are numerous. In [[2001 NCAA Division I-A football season|2001]], for example, [[University of Oregon|Oregon]], second ranked in the [[AP poll]], was bypassed in favor of [[Nebraska Cornhuskers|Nebraska]] despite Nebraska's loss in its final regular season game to the University of Colorado. In 2003, USC was not included in the [[2004 Sugar Bowl|BCS Championship Game]], but beat Michigan in the [[2004 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]] and ended up #1 in the Associated Press final poll. The following season, in [[2004 NCAA Division I-A football season|2004]], undefeated [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn University]], [[Boise State University]] and [[University of Utah]] teams were left out of the National Championship Game (the [[FedEx]] Orange Bowl), although those teams were undefeated as well. In 2008, the University of Utah was excluded from the BCS championship for a second time despite being the only undefeated Division I-A team at the end of the season and finished second behind 13–1 Florida. In 2009, five schools finished the regular season undefeated: Alabama, Texas, [[University of Cincinnati|Cincinnati]], [[Texas Christian University]], and Boise State; however, the BCS selected traditional powers Alabama and Texas to participate in the BCS National Championship Game as they were the top two teams in the BCS rankings.  . 

Many critics of the Bowl Championship Series favor a larger championship tournament with eight to sixteen teams, similar to that administered by the NCAA for its [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS)]], [[Division II (NCAA)|Division II]], and [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] football championships. Others favor adopting the incremental step of adding a single post-bowl championship game between the winners of two BCS games among the top four ranked teams in the BCS standings, the so-called "plus one" option. The SEC and ACC conferences have recently pushed for some form of playoff system. On June 24, 2009, the BCS presidential oversight committee rejected the [[Mountain West Conference]]'s proposed eight-team playoff plan. <ref>[http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-newswire25-2009jun25,0,6369590.story College football: BCS presidents reject playoff plan], ''Los Angeles Times'', June 25, 2009</ref> . 

In 2009, the NCAA ruled that former USC running back Reggie Bush was retroactively ineligible for the 2004 BCS National Championship Game, the 2005 Orange Bowl vs. Oklahoma, for receiving various illegal benefits.  In May 2011, the NCAA rejected all appeals of USC's penalties, which included Bush's ineligibility and a two-year bowl ban.  On June 6, 2011, the University of Southern California became the first school to lose a Bowl Championship Series National Championship due to NCAA sanctions, as the BCS President's Oversight Committee stripped USC of the 2004 title.  There will be no 2004 champion.  . 

In addition, the BCS also nullified USC's participation in the 2006 Rose Bowl. (See attributions 1 and 2.) . 

==Future==. 
The game's location rotates among the sites of the BCS bowls. Future scheduled sites are as follows (note the years shown are for the game, which occurs in the calendar year following the corresponding NCAA football season): . 

*[[Sun Life Stadium]] in [[Miami Gardens, Florida]] in 2013 ([[Discover Financial|Discover]] BCS National Championship Game)
*[[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] in [[Pasadena, California]] in 2014 ([[Vizio]] BCS National Championship Game) . 

The title sponsor of the BCS National Championship Game each year is the same as that of the bowl game in that year's host location. Thus, the 2007 game was the Tostitos BCS National Championship Game, after the title sponsor of the Fiesta Bowl. The following year saw it become the Allstate BCS National Championship, and the 2009 game bears the FedEx brand. The 2010 game had [[Citigroup|Citi]] as its title sponsor. <ref>[http://www.allstatesugarbowl.org/Allstate%20Sugar%20Bowl%20Press%20Release.pdf Allstate press release, March 22, 2006]</ref> . 

Based upon television contracts between the BCS and the [[Pasadena Tournament of Roses]] with [[ESPN]], the BCS will retain its current format through at least the 2014 season, when the game will be sponsored by [[Vizio]]. <ref>Chris Casacchia,[http://www.ocbj.com/news/2010/oct/19/vizio-inc-nabs-four-year-rose-bowl-presenting-spon/ Vizio Nabs Four-Year Rose Bowl Presenting Sponsorship], ''Orange County Business Journal'', October 19, 2010</ref> .

==Media coverage==. 
===Television===. 
From 1999 through 2006, [[College Football on ABC|ABC]] broadcast eight BCS National Championship Games pursuant to broadcasting rights negotiated with the BCS and the Rose Bowl, whose rights were offered separately. Beginning with the 2006–07 season, [[Fox Sports (USA)|FOX]] obtained the BCS package, consisting of the Orange Bowl, Fiesta Bowl, Sugar Bowl, and the BCS National Championship Games hosted by these bowls, with ABC retaining the rights to the Rose Bowl and BCS National Championship Games hosted by the Rose Bowl (such as the 2010 edition) . 

On November 18, 2008, the BCS announced that [[College Football on ESPN|ESPN]] had won the television rights to the BCS National Championship Game (as well as the other four BCS bowls) for 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. The contract with ESPN is notable as it makes the BCS National Championship Game the most prominent annual sporting event not to be shown over [[broadcast television]]. <ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3710477 ESPN, BCS agree to four-year deal for television, radio, digital rights]</ref> .

==Related national championship selections==. 
{{see also|College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS}} . 

Since there is no [[College football playoff debate|NCAA Division I FBS playoff]], the BCS National Championship game is one of several national championship selection processes in existence.  . 

The [[American Football Coaches Association]] (AFCA) participate in a weekly [[Coaches' Poll]] published by ''[[USA Today]]''; for its final poll of the season, the AFCA is contractually bound to select the BCS National Champion as the national champion<ref>O'Toole, Thomas. (2009-01-14) [http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/2009-01-13-bcs-coaches_N.htm Role of coaches' poll in BCS under review]. Usatoday.Com. Retrieved on 2010-11-21. </ref> Thus, the winner of the game is awarded the [[AFCA National Championship Trophy]] in a postgame ceremony.  . 

The BCS National Champion is also automatically awarded the [[National Football Foundation]]'s [[MacArthur Trophy]]. <ref>[http://www.footballfoundation.com/Macarthurhist.php MacArthur Trophy] at the [[National Football Foundation]]</ref>  . 

The [[Associated Press]] and the [[Football Writers Association of America]] are independent and may award their national championship trophies to a school other than the BCS National Championship Game winner.  .
