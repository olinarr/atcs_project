[[File:2010 BCS Champ.jpg|thumb|290px|BCS Championship game at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]], [[Pasadena, California]], January 7, 2010]]
The '''Bowl Championship Series''' ('''BCS''') is a selection system that creates five bowl match-ups involving ten of the top ranked teams in the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS), including an opportunity for the top two to compete in the BCS National Championship Game.  . 

The BCS relies on a combination of polls and computer selection methods to determine relative team rankings, and to narrow the field to two teams to play in the [[BCS National Championship Game]] held after the other college bowl games. The [[American Football Coaches Association]] is contractually bound to vote the winner of this game as the BCS National Champion and the contract signed by each conference requires them to recognize the winner of the BCS National Championship game as the official and only Champion. The BCS was created to end split championships and for the Champion to win the title on the field between the two teams selected by the BCS. In that regard it has failed, as the [[2003 NCAA Division I-A football season]] ended with a split championship.  . 

The system also selects match-ups for the other prestigious BCS [[bowl game]]s. The ten teams selected include the conference champion from each of the six [[Automatic Qualifying conference]]s plus four others. The BCS was created by formal agreement by those six conferences (the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|Atlantic Coast]], [[Big East Conference|Big East]], [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]], [[Big 12 Conference|Big 12]], Pacific-10 [now [[Pacific-12 Conference|Pacific-12]]], and [[Southeastern Conference|Southeastern]] conferences) and the three FBS [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|independent schools]], and has evolved to allow other conferences to participate to a lesser degree.  . 

It has been in place since the [[1998 NCAA Division I-A football season|1998 season]]. Prior to its formation, the Associated Press’s number one and two teams met in bowl games only eight times in 56 seasons. In contrast, since the creation of the BCS, number one has played number two 12 years in a row by BCS measurements and nine times according to the AP Poll. Prior to the [[2006 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2006 season]] eight teams competed in four BCS Bowls. The BCS replaced the [[Bowl Alliance]], in place from 1995–1997, which followed the [[Bowl Coalition]], in place from 1992–1994.  . 

==History leading to creation of the BCS==. 
The [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) is the only NCAA-sponsored sport without an organized tournament to determine its champion. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meridianmagazine.com/sports/031128ncaa.html |title=Sports :NCAA Football Tournament: An Imagined Solution to a Real Problem |publisher=Meridian Magazine |date= |accessdate=2009-11-19}}</ref> Instead, the postseason has historically consisted of individual [[bowl game]]s.  . 

The bowl system began in 1902 with the East-West game in Pasadena, California. Held on [[New Year's Day]] in conjunction with the [[Tournament of Roses]], this was an exhibition game between a highly rated team from the west coast and a team east of the [[Mississippi River]]. In this first game, representing the East, the [[University of Michigan]] [[Michigan Wolverines|Wolverines]], No. 1 and undefeated, having not been so much as scored upon all season, defeated the West's [[Stanford University]] Indians (later renamed [[Stanford Cardinal|Cardinal]]) by a score of 49–0. The lopsided score led to Stanford calling for an end to the game during the third quarter, and also led to the post-season football game not being played again until 1916.  . 

This was an ideal time for a postseason game, as fans could take off work or school during this holiday period to travel to the game. The game was renamed the [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] in the late 1920s due to the shape of the new stadium built in Pasadena.  By the 1930s, the [[Cotton Bowl Classic]], [[Orange Bowl]], and the [[Sugar Bowl]] were also held on January 1 to showcase teams from other regions of the country.  . 

By the 1940s, college football conferences began signing contracts that tied their championship team to a particular bowl.  In 1947, the [[Big Ten Conference]] and the [[Pacific Coast Conference]], a forerunner of today's [[Pacific-12 Conference]], agreed to commit their champions to play in the Rose Bowl every year, an agreement that continued under the BCS. This system raised the possibility that the two top-ranked teams in the final poll would not play each other in a bowl game. Indeed, the two top-ranked teams in the final regular-season [[AP Poll]] had only played each other in a bowl six times since the AP began releasing its final poll after the bowl games in 1968. Under the circumstances, it was also possible to have a split national championship.  . 

In 1991, the [[University of Miami]] [[Miami Hurricanes football|Hurricanes]] and the [[University of Washington]] [[Washington Huskies football|Huskies]] were considered the strongest teams in the nation.  Since the Huskies were locked into the Rose Bowl as the Pacific 10 Conference champion against Big Ten champion Michigan, they could not play Miami, who played in the Orange Bowl.  Both teams won their bowl games convincingly and shared the national championship, Miami winning the [[Associated Press]] poll and Washington earning the top spot in the Coaches Poll.  A split national championship has happened on many occasions since then, as well. (See: [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship]] for a compilation of past "national champions" since 1869.) . 

Other teams have won the national championship despite playing presumably weaker schedules than other championship contenders. The [[BYU Cougars]] ended the 1984 season as the only undefeated and untied team in the nation as a member of the [[Western Athletic Conference]]. The Cougars opened the season with a 20–14 victory over #3 Pittsburgh, and won the [[Holiday Bowl]] against a 6–5 Michigan team that had been ranked as high as #2 that season. As the #4 ranked team at the end of the regular season, the [[University of Washington]] [[Washington Huskies football|Huskies]] were offered a slot against BYU in the Holiday Bowl; Washington declined, preferring instead to play in the more lucrative [[Orange Bowl]] where they beat #2 Oklahoma to complete a Pac-10 sweep of New Year's Day bowls (USC Rose and UCLA Fiesta).  Washington (11–1) was voted #2 following the bowl season with their only blemish a late season loss at Pac-10 champ USC.  Coupled with the 1983 season of 11 consecutive wins, BYU finished the 1984 season with a 24 game winning streak and was a near-unanimous choice as national champion in final polls.  . 

To address these problems, five conferences, six bowl games, and leading independent [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish|Notre Dame]] joined forces to create the [[Bowl Coalition]], which was intended to force a ''de facto'' "national championship game" between the top two teams. By entirely excluding all the other conferences, the Bowl Coalition also made it impossible for a non-Bowl Coalition team to win a national championship. This system was in place from the 1992 season through the 1994 season. While traditional tie-ins between conferences and bowls remained, a team would be released to play in another bowl if it was necessary to force a championship game. However, this system did not include the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] and [[Pacific-12 Conference|Pac-10]] champions, as both were obligated to play in the Rose Bowl. The Coalition made several unsuccessful attempts to get the Tournament of Roses Association, which operates the Rose Bowl, to release the Big Ten and Pac-10 champions if necessary to force a championship game.  In 1994, undefeated [[Penn State Nittany Lions|Penn State]], from the Big Ten, played Oregon in the Rose Bowl while undefeated Nebraska played Miami in the Orange Bowl. In a system that paired top-ranked teams, Penn State would have played Nebraska for the national championship.  . 

The Bowl Coalition was restructured into the [[Bowl Alliance]] for the 1995 season, involving five conferences (reduced to four for the 1996 season) and three bowls (Fiesta, Sugar, and Orange). The championship game rotated among these three bowls. It still did not, however, include the Pac-10 or Big Ten champions, the Rose Bowl, or any non-Bowl Alliance teams.  . 

After a protracted round of negotiations, the Bowl Alliance was reformed into the '''Bowl Championship Series''' for the 1998 season; former [[Southeastern Conference]] commissioner [[Roy Kramer]] is considered to be the "father" of the BCS. <ref>{{cite news|last=Carey|first=Jack|title=Man behind creation of BCS pleased with results |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/bowls/2007-12-06-bcs2-football_N.htm|accessdate=7 January 2011|newspaper=USA Today|date=8 December 2007}}</ref> The Tournament of Roses Association agreed to release the Big Ten and Pac-10 champions if it was necessary to force a national championship game.  In return, the Rose Bowl was added to the yearly national championship rotation, and the game was able to keep its coveted exclusive TV time slot on the afternoon of New Year's Day. However, beginning with the [[2006 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2006 season]], the BCS National Championship Game became a separate event played at the same site as a host bowl a week following New Year's Day. The new Bowl Championship Series not only included the Big Ten and the Pac-10 conferences but also teams from mid-major conferences, based on performance.  . 

No mid-major however, or team from any conference outside of the 6 aligned conferences, has ever played in the BCS Championship Game, causing increasing controversy. This controversy has become even more intense in light of the 4–1 record that mid-major teams have against teams from the 6 automatic qualifying conferences in the BCS Bowl games they ''have'' been allowed to play in. The performances and perfect record of Texas Christian University in the 2010 season, and Boise State University in the season prior to that has also fueled the controversy surrounding the perceived inequalities that the BCS seems to perpetuate (see [[Bowl Championship Series#Controversies|BCS Controversies]] below or in this [[BCS controversies|more detailed separate article]]). However, little headway has been made to institute an alternative system like a playoff tournament, given the entrenched vested economic interests in the various bowls.  .

}} . 

In the current BCS format, four bowl games and the National Championship Game are considered "BCS bowl games." The four bowl games are the [[Rose Bowl Game]] in [[Pasadena, California]], the [[Sugar Bowl]] in [[New Orleans]], the [[Fiesta Bowl]] in [[Glendale, Arizona]] and the [[Orange Bowl]] in [[Miami Gardens, Florida]]. In the first eight seasons of the BCS contract, the championship game was rotated among the four bowls, with each bowl game hosting the national championship once every four years.  . 

Starting with the 2007 BCS, the site of the game that served as the last game on January 1 (or if January 1 fell on a Sunday, January 2) in the BCS then served as the host facility of the new stand-alone BCS National Championship game played on January 8 of that year, one week following the playing of the traditional bowl game which would follow the Rose Bowl with the exception of the games to be played in 2010. There are also thirty [[Automatic bids to college bowl games|non-BCS bowls]].  . 

Initial plans were for the additional BCS bowl game to be held at the site of that year's championship game, such that the additional, non-championship bowl be named after the original bowl (e.g. the Sugar Bowl when the championship is in New Orleans), and have the extra game just be called "The National Championship Game". Later, the BCS considered having cities bid to be the permanent site of the new BCS game, and to place the new game in the title rotation. In the end, the BCS opted for its original plan.  . 

The [[Oklahoma Sooners football|University of Oklahoma]] is the only school to appear in all five BCS Bowls, playing in the [[2007 Fiesta Bowl|2007]], [[2008 Fiesta Bowl|2008]] and [[2011 Fiesta Bowl]], the [[2004 Sugar Bowl]], the [[2001 Orange Bowl|2001]] and [[2005 Orange Bowl]], the [[2003 Rose Bowl]], and the [[2009 BCS National Championship Game]]. Oklahoma’s record stands at 3–5 with a 1–3 record in National Title games. The [[Miami Hurricanes football|University of Miami]] has appeared in every BCS bowl except for the standalone National Championship Game, although Miami did appear in the national championship when that designation was assigned to the original four bowls in rotation. Miami played in the [[2001 Sugar Bowl]], [[2002 Rose Bowl]] (national championship), [[2003 Fiesta Bowl]] (national championship), and [[2004 Orange Bowl]].  . 

===Television=== . 

Initially, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] held the rights to all four original BCS games, picking up the Fiesta and Orange Bowls from their former homes at [[CBS]], and continuing their lengthy relationships with the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose]] and Sugar Bowls. This relationship continued through the bowl games of January, 2006.  . 

Beginning with the 2006–07 season through the 2009–10 season, any BCS game (including the National Championship Game) hosted by the Fiesta, Orange or Sugar Bowls aired on the [[Fox Network]] while games hosted by the [[Pasadena Tournament of Roses]] were shown on ABC. Starting with the 2010–2011 season, [[ESPN]] will air all BCS games, including the Rose Bowl. The TV deal expires with the January 2014 games. <ref name="ESPN BCS" /> . 

===Selection of teams===. 
A set of rules is used to determine which teams compete in the BCS bowl games. <ref name="bcsrules">"[http://www.bcsfootball.org/news/story?id=4819597 BCS selection procedures]" Bowl Championship Series, 26 April 2010. </ref> . 

Certain teams are given automatic berths depending on their BCS ranking and conference, as follows:
*The top two teams are given automatic berths in the BCS National Championship Game. 
*The champion of a [[BCS conference]]<ref name="bcsconfdef">This article uses "BCS conference" in its popular sense, referring strictly to the six conferences that earn automatic berths in BCS bowl games. The BCS itself officially considers all FBS conferences to be "BCS conferences", using the terms "AQ" (automatic qualifier) and "non-AQ" to distinguish between conferences that automatically earn BCS bowl berths and those that do not. </ref> ([[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]], [[Big 12 Conference|Big 12]], [[Big East Conference|Big East]], [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]], [[Pacific-12 Conference|Pac-12]], and [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]]) is guaranteed an automatic BCS bowl bid. 
*Due to the "Notre Dame rule",<ref name="mandel20100818">{{cite news | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/stewart_mandel/08/18/byu.mwc/index.html | title=Would BYU be Notre Dame as a football independent ... or Navy? | accessdate=March 31, 2011 | author=Mandel, Stewart | date=2010-08-18 | publisher=Time Inc.}}</ref> independent [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] receives an automatic berth if it finishes in the top eight. 
*The highest-ranked champion of a non-BCS conference will receive an automatic berth if:
** It is ranked in the top 12, or
** Ranked in the top 16 and higher than at least one BCS conference champion. 
* No more than one such team from [[Conference USA]], the [[Mid-American Conference]], the [[Mountain West Conference]], the [[Sun Belt Conference]], and the [[Western Athletic Conference]] shall earn an automatic berth in any year. However, a second team from one of these conferences may qualify as a BCS at-large. 
* No more than two teams from any one conference may receive berths in BCS games unless two non-champions from a BCS conference finish as the top two teams in the final BCS standings, in which case they will meet in the National Title Game while their conference champion will play in their conference's BCS bowl game. 
*The third-ranked team will receive an automatic berth if it has not already received one, if it is a member of a BCS conference, and provided that its conference has not already earned two automatic berths, if there is room. 
*If the third-ranked team did not require a berth using the previous provision, then the fourth-ranked team will receive an automatic berth if it has not already received one, if it is a member of a BCS conference, and provided that its conference has not already earned two automatic berths, if there is room.  . 

After the automatic berths have been granted, the remaining berths, known as "at-large" berths, are filled from a pool of teams who are ranked in the top 14 and have at least nine wins.  The actual teams that are chosen for the at-large berths are determined by the individual bowl committees.  . 

If fewer than 10 teams are eligible for selection, then an at-large team will be any Football Bowl Subdivision team that is bowl-eligible, has won at least nine regular-season games, and is among the top 18 teams in the final BCS Standings, though any at-large team ranked in the top 14 will be guaranteed a bid over at-large teams ranked lower than 14th. If fewer than 10 teams are eligible after expanding the at-large pool to 18 teams, then the at-large pool will continue to be expanded by four additional positions in the BCS Standings until 10 or more teams are eligible. No team ranked lower than 14 has used this rule to earn an at-large bid, although several teams ranked lower than 14 have received a bid for winning their conference, as the rule was not in place in the early years of the BCS.  . 

All BCS conferences except the Big East have contracts for their champions to participate in specific BCS bowl games. Unless their champion is involved in the BCS National Championship game, the conference tie-ins are:
*Rose Bowl – Big Ten champion vs. Pac-12 champion
*Fiesta Bowl – Big 12 champion vs. at large
*Orange Bowl – ACC champion vs. at large
*Sugar Bowl – SEC champion vs. at large . 

The Big East champion takes one of the remaining spots.  . 

If the Pac-12 or Big Ten champion is picked for the BCS National Championship Game, then the Rose Bowl must choose the highest-ranked school from a non-AQ conference instead of the respective conference's #2 team if there is a non-AQ school ranked at least #4 in the final BCS standings. This was the case in 2010, when the [[Oregon Ducks]] made it to the national championship, permitting the #3 [[TCU Horned Frogs]] to attend, and win, the 2011 Rose Bowl. The Rose Bowl is permitted to override this provision if it has been taken within the previous four seasons.  . 

All 11 conferences compete for an opportunity to earn AQ status. As agreed by all 11 conferences, the results of the 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007 regular seasons were evaluated to determine which conferences earned automatic qualification. Three criteria were used: Rank of the highest-ranked team, rank of all conference teams, and number of teams in the top 25. The six conferences which met that standard are the current BCS conferences.  . 

The 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 seasons will be used to determine if another conference achieves automatic qualification for the BCS games that will conclude the 2012 and 2013 seasons.  . 

==Rankings==. 
For the portions of the ranking that are determined by polls and computer-generated rankings, the BCS uses a series of [[Borda count]]s to arrive at its overall rankings. This is an example of using a [[voting system]] to generate a complete ordered list of winners from both human and computer-constructed votes.  Obtaining a fair ranking system is a difficult mathematical problem and numerous algorithms have been proposed for ranking college football teams in particular.  One example is the "random-walker rankings" studied by applied mathematicians Thomas Callaghan, [[Peter Mucha]], and [[Mason Porter]] that employs the science of [[Complex Networks|complex networks]].  . 

===1998–2003===. 
The BCS formula calculated the top 25 teams in poll format.  After combining a number of factors, a final point total was created and the teams that received the 25 lowest scores were ranked in descending order.  The factors were:
*Poll average: Both the [[Associated Press|AP]] and ESPN-''[[USA Today]]'' coaches polls were averaged to make a number which is the poll average. 
*Computer average: An average of the rankings of a team in three different [[sports rating system|computer polls]] were gathered ([[Jeff Sagarin]]/''[[USA Today]]'', Anderson-Hester/''[[Seattle Times]]'', and ''[[New York Times]]''), with a 50% adjusted maximum deviation factor. (For instance, if the computers had ranked a team third, fifth, and twelfth, the poll which ranked the team twelfth would be adjusted to rank the team sixth.)
*Strength of Schedule: This was the team's NCAA rank in strength of schedule divided by 25.  A team's strength of schedule was calculated by win/loss record of opponents (66.6%) and cumulative win/loss record of team's opponents' opponents (33.3%). The team who played the toughest schedule was given .04 points, second toughest .08 points, and so on. 
Margin of victory is a key component in the decision of the computer rankings to determine the BCS standings. 
*Losses: One point was added for every loss the team has suffered during the season. All games are counted, including Kickoff Classics and conference title games. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fansonly.com/schools//md/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/061098aaa.html |title=New Formula for Football Championship Announced :: Top bowl game to be chosen by polls, computers, formulas |publisher=Fansonly.com |date=June 10, 1998 |accessdate=May 1, 2009}}</ref> . 

Before the 1999–2000 season, five more computer rankings were added to the system: Richard Billingsley, Richard Dunkel, [[Kenneth Massey]], Herman Matthews/''[[Scripps Howard]]'', and [[David Rothman (statistician)|David Rothman]]. The lowest ranking was dropped and the remainder averaged.  . 

Beginning in 2001, The Peter Wolfe and Wes Colley/''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' computer rankings were used in place of the ''NYT'' and Dunkel rankings. The change was made because the BCS wanted computer rankings that did not depend heavily on margin of victory. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/ncf/s/2001/0712/1225482.html |title=BCS formula still subject of debate |publisher=ESPN.com |date=September 16, 2002 |accessdate=May 1, 2009}}</ref> The highest and lowest rankings were discarded, and the remainder averaged. A team's poll average, computer average, strength of schedule points, and losses were added to create a subtotal.  . 

Also in 2001, a quality win component was added. If a team beat a team which was in the top 15 in the BCS standings, a range of 1.5 to .1 points was subtracted from their total.  Beating the #1 ranked team resulted in a subtraction of 1.5 point, beating the #2 team resulted in a deduction of 1.4 points, and so on. Beating the #15 ranked team would have resulted in a deduction of .1 points.  A team would only be awarded for a quality win once if it beat a Top 10 team more than once (such as in the regular season and a conference championship game), and quality wins were determined using a team's current subtotal, not the ranking when the game was played. The subtotal ranks were used to determine quality win deductions to create a team's final score.  . 

The BCS continued to purge ranking systems which included margin of victory, causing the removal of the Matthews and [[David Rothman (statistician)]] ratings before the 2002 season. Sagarin provided a BCS-specific formula that did not include margin of victory, and the ''New York Times'' index returned in a form without margin of victory considerations. In addition, a new computer ranking, the Wesley Colley Matrix, was added. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyorange.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&uStory_id=22d3b932-8bfc-4123-8def-1c0a962fe5b2 |title=Big East takes charge of BCS<!- bot-generated title -> |publisher=The Daily Orange |date=January 3, 2003 |accessdate=May 1, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The lowest ranking was dropped and the remaining six averaged. Also in 2002, the quality win component was modified such that the deduction for beating the #1 team in the BCS would be 1.0, declining by 0.1 increments until beating the 10th ranked team at 0.1. Teams on probation were not included in the BCS standings, but quality win points were given to teams who beat teams on probation as if they were ranked accordingly in the BCS.  . 

===2004–present===. 
[[File:LSU - OSU 1.JPG|thumb|LSU vs. Ohio State in the [[2008 BCS National Championship Game]]]]
In response to the controversy created by the voters in the AP poll naming USC as the No. 1 ranked team at the end of the year,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://badgerherald.com/sports/2005/01/17/ap_removes_poll_from.php | title=AP removes poll from BCS formula | publisher=Badger Herald | author=Patrick Klemz | date=January 17, 2005 | accessdate=October 8, 2007}}</ref>  the formula was rewritten.  Supporters of USC and the media in general criticized the fact that polls were not weighted more heavily than computer rankings and this criticism led to the new algorithm.  . 

*Harris Interactive Poll: A team's score in the Harris poll will be divided by 2,875, which is the maximum number of points any team can receive if all 115 voting members rank the same team as Number 1. Example: 2,875 / 2,875 = 1.0. If a team receives a total of 115 voting points, an average of 25th place, their BCS quotient of this component would be .04. (1.0 / 25 = 0.04). <ref>http://www.collegefootballpoll.com/bcs_explained.html Retrieved 2012-01-04</ref>
*Coaches' Poll: This is calculated in the same manner as the AP Poll number. For LSU, their final regular-season number in this poll would have been 99.4 (1,516 out of 1,525 possible points). 
*Computer Average: The BCS used six ranking systems: [[Jeff Sagarin]], [http://andersonsports.com/football/ACF_frnk.html Anderson/Hester], [http://www.cfrc.com/ Richard Billingsley], [http://www.colleyrankings.com/ Colley Matrix], [http://www.masseyratings.com/ Kenneth Massey], and [http://prwolfe.bol.ucla.edu/cfootball/home.htm Dr. Peter Wolfe]. A team's highest and lowest computer ranking will be discarded from figuring a team's computer poll average. Points will be assigned in inverse order of ranking from 1–25. The four remaining computer scores will be averaged and the total will be calculated as a percentage of 100. <ref>[http://www.bcsfootball.org/news/story?id=4765872 BCS computer rankings] BCSfootball.org. Retrieved 2011-08-11. </ref>  . 

All three components – The Harris Interactive Poll, the USA Today Coaches Poll and the computer rankings – shall be added together and averaged for a team's ranking in the BCS standings. The team with the highest average shall rank first in the BCS standings.  . 

For USC, dropping their highest and lowest computer rankings would have left them with four third-place finishes, worth 23 points each for a total of 92, while LSU would have had four second-place finishes for a total of 96. The BCS [[arithmetic mean|averaged]] the three numbers obtained above, divided the result by 100, and converted it to a decimal fraction. This system placed twice as much emphasis on polls than computer rankings (since there were two polls and an average of six computer rankings), and made it highly unlikely that the top team in both polls would be denied a place in the title game, as it happened in 2003–04.  . 

The BCS formula for the 2005–06 season was the same as 2004–05, except that the [[Harris Interactive College Football Poll]] replaced the AP poll. {{ref|BCS1}} {{ref|HIP1}} The Harris Interactive College Football Poll's maximum point value was 2,825<ref>[http://msn.foxsports.com/id/7894701_37_1.pdf] {{dead link|ate=December 2011|date=December 2011}}</ref> and for the Coaches' Poll, it was 1,550. The Harris Interactive College Football Poll was created expressly to replace the AP Poll after the Associated Press refused the use of its poll as a component of the BCS formula.  Before the 2006–07 season, the maximum point value of the Harris Poll was increased to 2,850 and the USA Today/Coaches' Poll was increased to 1,575.  . 

In the week of April 20, 2009, Bowl Championship Series commissioners were meeting for its annual spring meetings in [[Pasadena, California]] in conjunction with the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]]'s staging the [[2010 BCS National Championship Game|2010 BCS title game]]. The commissioners considered a proposal from the [[Mountain West Conference]], which  would establish an eight-team playoff and provide better accesses to the four BCS bowl games for the five conferences that do not have automatic bids. The proposal also included a motion to replace the BCS rankings with a selection and a motion to change the automatic qualifier criteria to better reflect inter-conference performance. The BCS rejected the proposal in June 2009, citing a "lack of overall support" among the member conferences. <ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=4285164 Bowl Championship Series rejects Mountain West's playoff proposal – ESPN].

††Although the Mountain West and WAC do not automatically qualify for BCS bowls, some of their appearances are not considered at-large bids because of the rule allowing the highest ranked conference champion from a non-automatic-qualifying conference to receive an automatic bid if they are in the top 12.

==Controversies==. 
{{Main|BCS controversies}} . 

===Criticism===. 
The primary criticism of the BCS centers around the validity of the annual BCS national championship pairings and its designated ''National Champions''. Many critics focus on the BCS methodology itself, which employs subjective voting assessments, while others note the ability for undefeated teams to finish seasons without an opportunity to play in the ''national championship'' game. In fact, in the last 6 seasons of Division I FBS football, there have been more undefeated non-BCS champions than undefeated BCS champions. Other criticisms involve discrepancies in the allocation of monetary resources from BCS games, as well as the determination of non-championship BCS game participants, which need not comply with the BCS rankings themselves. <ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=4030992 Prospect of antitrust lawsuit from Utah increases pressure on BCS – ESPN]. Sports.espn.go.com (2009-03-31). Retrieved on 2011-12-05. </ref>  In the 2010–2011 bowl season, for example, the six automatic-qualifier (AQ) conferences were given $145.2 million in revenue from the BCS while the five non-AQ conferences received only $24.7 million. <ref name="Murphy, Austin 2011, p. 23">Murphy, Austin, "Under Attack", ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', 2 May 2011, p. 23. </ref> . 

A recent survey conducted at the [[Quinnipiac University]] found that 63% of individuals interested in college football preferred a playoff system to the BCS, while only 26% favored the status quo. <ref>[http://www.sltrib.com/sports/ci_14087869 Utah News – Salt Lake City News, Sports, Entertainment, Business – The Salt Lake Tribune]. Sltrib.com (2009-12-29). Retrieved on 2011-12-05. </ref> President [[Barack Obama]] has been vocal about his opposition to the BCS. During an appearance on [[Monday Night Football]] during the [[2008 presidential campaign]] season, ESPN's [[Chris Berman]] asked Obama to name one thing about sports he would like to change. <ref name=obama1>{{cite news |title=McCain, Obama are ‘Monday Night Football’ halftime show |first=Diane |last=Pucin |work=Los Angeles Times |date=November 4, 2008 |page=D-1 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/nov/04/sports/sp-media4 |quote=I think it is about time we had playoffs ... I'm fed up with these computer rankings and this and that and the other. Get eight teams – the top eight teams right at the end. You got a playoff. }}</ref> Obama responded that he did not like using computer rankings to determine bowl games, and he supported having a college football playoff for the top eight teams. <ref name=obama1/> When [[Steve Kroft]] asked then-President-elect Obama about the subject during an interview on [[60 Minutes]], Obama reiterated his support of eight-team playoff; although he has said it is not a legislative priority. <ref>{{cite news |first=Wyndam |last=Makowsky |title=Between the lines: Barack to BCS: time for change |work=The Stanford Daily |publisher=The Stanford Daily Publishing Corporation |date=November 18, 2008 |url=http://www.stanforddaily.com/cgi-bin/?p=1548 |quote=Kroft: As president of the United States, what can you do, or what do you plan to do, about getting a college football playoff for the national championship? Obama: Eight teams. That would be three rounds, to determine a national champion. It would add three extra weeks to the season. You could trim back on the regular season. }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=President-elect Obama makes another play for college football playoff |work=ESPN |date=November 15, 2008 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3704864 }}</ref> . 

Longtime college football announcer [[Brent Musburger]] also voiced his support for a playoff in an interview with the [[Chicago Sun-Times]]. "My dream scenario – and it's not going to happen – would be to take eight conference champions, and only conference champions, and play the quarterfinals of a tournament on campuses in mid-December," Musburger said. "The four losers would remain bowl-eligible. The four winners would advance to semifinals on New Year's Day with exclusive TV windows.

Joe Barton (R-TX), ranking member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, announced that he would hold anti-trust hearings on the BCS, again based on the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and its provisions outlawing non-competitive trusts, beginning in May 2010. <ref>T[http://www.star-telegram.com/news/story/1792536.html "Barton Says BCS 'Is Simply A Cartel, Much Like OPEC' And Doesn't Give TCU A Fair Shake"]. he Fort Worth Star Telegram, November 26, 2009</ref> Meanwhile, various organizations, including the BCS, are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to lobby the federal government both in support and in opposition to a college football playoff system. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2009/12/bcs-becomes-political-football.html |title=BCS Becomes Political Football as Lobbyists Blitz Congress |agency=Capital Eye |publisher=Center for Responsive Politics |author=Dave Levinthal |date=December 17, 2009 }}</ref> . 

According to [[CBSSports.com]] wire reports and information obtained by the [[Associated Press]], Senator Orin Hatch received a letter from the justice department concerning the possibility of a legal review of the BCS. The letter, received on January 29, 2010, states that the Obama administration will explore options to establish a college football playoff including (a) an anti-trust lawsuit against the BCS, (b) legal action under [[Federal Trade Commission]] consumer protection laws, (c) encouragement of the NCAA to take control of the college football postseason, (d) the establishment of an agency to review the costs and benefits of adopting a playoff system, and (e) continued legislation in favor of a playoff system. Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich writes, "The administration shares your belief that the lack of a college football national championship playoff ...raises important questions affecting millions...." BCS Executive Director Bill Hancock responded to the letter that the BCS complies with all laws and is supported by the participating Division I universities. <ref>[http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/story/12858012/obama-administration-considering-action-on-bcs Obama administration considering action on BCS – NCAA Football]. CBSSports.com (2010-01-29). Retrieved on 2011-12-05. </ref> . 

In April 2011, Utah attorney general [[Mark Shurtleff]] announced he would file an antitrust lawsuit against the BCS for, "serious antitrust violations that are harming taxpayer-funded institutions to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars."  The announcement followed the April 12, 2011 delivery of a letter to the US Department of Justice signed by 21 "high-profile" economists and antitrust experts asking for an investigation into the BCS' anticompetitive practices. <ref name="Murphy, Austin 2011, p. 23"/> . 

===Allegations of corruption and financial impropriety===. 
The BCS bowls have been accused of promoting the BCS system because they and their executive officers greatly benefit financially from the system.  Bowl executives, such as John Junker of the [[Fiesta Bowl]], are often paid unusually high salaries for employees of non-profit organizations.  To promote support for their bowls and the BCS system, these highly-paid executives allegedly give lavish gifts to politicians, collegiate sports executives, and university athletic directors. <ref name="Murphy, Austin 2011, pp. 20">Murphy, Austin, and Michael McKnight, "A Bowl Full of Trouble", ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', 4 April 2011, pp. 20–21. </ref> . 

In response, a pro-playoff organization, called Playoff PAC, in September 2010 filed a complaint with the [[Internal Revenue Service]].  The complaint alleges that the top BCS bowls, with the exception of the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]], routinely abuse favorable tax status by using charitable donations to give gifts and compensation to college athletic officials.  In one example detailed in the complaint, the [[Orange Bowl]] treated its executive staff and invited college athletic directors to a four day [[Royal Caribbean International|Royal Caribbean]] cruise in which no business meetings were held. <ref name="Murphy, Austin 2011, pp. 20"/> . 

===Illegal teams and vacation of wins/participation=== . 

Over the last two years, an increasing eye has been getting turned toward programs which have earned BCS bowl bids by illegal conduct under the rules and regulations of the NCAA.  . 

In the summer of 2011 alone, in addition to the allegations noted above with respect to the Fiesta Bowl: . 

*USC's final appeals were exhausted in the [[Reggie Bush]] situation, with all penalties standing, including a two-year bowl ban and vacation of 14 wins, including a national championship and the entire following season.  As a result, the BCS, in a first-time action, vacated the ''participation'' of USC's participation in their 2004–2005 National Championship Game win and the 2005–2006 National Championship Game loss to Texas.  The 2004–2005 BCS National Championship will remain permanently vacant. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcsfootball.org/news/story?id=6632189|title=BCS Group vacates USC 2004–05 national championship following NCAA denial of appeal|date=June 6, 2011|work=bcsfootball.org}}</ref> . 

*In December 2010, five Ohio State University players were implicated in an illegal-benefits scandal preceding the 2011 Sugar Bowl.  Though the five players were suspended for five games apiece, not only was Ohio State still allowed to play in the 2011 Sugar Bowl, but so were the five players.  After defeating Arkansas, the scandal grew, including open deception by Ohio State coach Jim Tressel.  As a result, Tressel has been forced out and, on July 11, 2011, Ohio State University vacated all of its wins in an effort to reduce their penalties in an upcoming August, 2011 NCAA meeting. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/08/ohio-state-vacates-2011-sugar-bowl_n_893371.html|title=Ohio State Vacates 2011 Sugar Bowl, 2010 Football Wins|date=07/8/2011|work=Huffington Post}}</ref>  The BCS has taken no action at this time, awaiting the NCAA's penalties before it does.  . 

*On July 14, 2011, after the completion of a long investigation into athletics at Georgia Tech, the NCAA found that, while there was no conclusive evidence that Georgia Tech had used an ineligible player for the last two regular-season games of the 2009 year and their [[ACC Championship Game]] victory, the administration had been less cooperative than the NCAA had wished.  As a result, those three games have been vacated by the NCAA. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/6769894/ncaa-places-georgia-tech-yellow-jackets-four-years-probation|title=NCAA places Georgia Tech on probation|date=July 18, 2011|work=ESPN College Sports}}</ref>  The BCS has taken no action at this time, awaiting the results of Georgia Tech's NCAA appeal.  . 

===Support===. 
While there is substantial criticism aimed at the BCS system from coaches, media, and fans alike, there is also support for the system. [[Tim Cowlishaw]] of [[The Dallas Morning News]] cites several advantages that the BCS has over a [[playoff]] system. Under the BCS, a single defeat is extremely detrimental to a team's prospects for a national championship,<ref>Isaac Luber 
[http://bleacherreport.com/articles/80246-college-football-and-feeling-the-pain-of-a-late-season-loss College Football and Feeling the Pain of a Late-Season Loss]. Bleacherreport.com. November 11, 2008. Retrieved on 2011-12-05. </ref> although critics point out regularly that history shows non-BCS conference teams are hurt far more than BCS teams when they lose a game.  Supporters contend that this creates a substantial incentive for teams to do their best to win every game. Under a playoff system, front-running teams could be in a position of safety at the end of the regular season and could pull or greatly reduce their use of top players in order to protect them from injuries or give them recovery time (this happens frequently in the [[National Football League|NFL]]). <ref>John Oehser [http://web.archive.org/web/20110708185739/http://cache.colts.com/modules/article7_print.cfm?news_id=0ccb9424-c337-4fbe-876e-02e21b755afc Time to Shine]. Colts.com. December 26, 2008</ref> This may be less likely to happen under the BCS system where a team in the running for a #1 or #2 ranking at the end of the year would likely be punished in the polls for a loss, potentially eliminating them from contention.  . 

While the BCS routinely involves controversy about which two teams are the top teams, in rare instances there is a clear-cut top two; the BCS ensures these top two will play each other for the championship. For example, USC and Texas in 2005 were the only undefeated teams; both teams were only tested a couple of times all season and mauled every other opponent they faced by large margins. Had this scenario occurred before the inception of the BCS, the teams would have been unable to play each other due to contractual obligations with the major bowls and there either would have been dual national champions or Texas would have been denied the title despite their record and talent. Under the BCS system however, these two teams got to play for the championship. <ref>[http://wwwc.house.gov/judiciary/Legacy/delany090403.htm Statement Of James E. Delany]. house.gov. Retrieved on 2011-12-05. </ref> . 

The NCAA, the governing organization of most collegiate sports, has no official process for determining its FBS (Div. 1-A) champion. Instead, FBS champions are chosen by what the NCAA calls in its official list of champions "selecting organizations". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaa.com/history/football-fbs.html |title=NCAA History – Past Football Champions |publisher=NCAA.com |date= |accessdate=May 1, 2009}}</ref> . 

According to its website, the BCS:
"...is managed by the commissioners of the 11 NCAA Division I-A conferences, the director of athletics at the University of Notre Dame, and representatives of the bowl organizations. 
"...is a five-game arrangement for post-season college football that is designed to match the two top-rated teams in a national championship game and to create exciting and competitive match-ups between eight other highly regarded teams in four other games". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/definition |title=The BCS is ... |work=BCSfootball.org |date= |accessdate=January 11, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> . 

==BCS Buster==. 
[[Image:UteFansRush.JPG|thumb|right|[[Utah Utes]] fans rush the field and carry the goalpost after defeating rival [[2004 Utah Utes football team#BYU|BYU]], completing a perfect [[2004 Utah Utes football team|regular season]], and becoming the first BCS Buster by clinching a spot in the [[2005 Fiesta Bowl]] (hence the [[sombrero]]).]]
The term "BCS Buster" refers to any team other than [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] not from a BCS conference that manages to earn a spot in a BCS bowl game. <ref name="BCSbusterUtah">{{cite web | url=http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,600103700,00.html | title=Utes had a Fiesta in 2004 | publisher=Deseret Morning News | author=Dirk Facer | date=January 10, 2005 | accessdate=October 8, 2007}}</ref> These teams are often referred to as non-BCS when discussed outside of the post-season structure.  . 

With the exception of Notre Dame, it is generally extremely difficult for a non-BCS team to reach a BCS bowl, while it is much easier for a BCS conference team (see rules above) to do so due to the inherent bias built into the rules of the BCS system. This makes becoming a BCS Buster very  noteworthy. Despite the fact that there have been a number of eligible non-AQ Conference teams, only seven teams (from only four schools – Utah, TCU, Boise State and Hawaii) have succeeded in becoming BCS Busters. No team outside the 6 BCS Conference have ever been in the BCS Championship, while a team from the SEC has been in the Championship game every year since 2006. This consistent selection of one Conference's teams, and other questionable selections, have been one area of intense criticism of the BCS system and its exclusionary tendencies.  . 

The [[Utah Utes football|University of Utah]] football program became the first BCS Buster in 2004 after an undefeated season, despite harder limits in place before the addition of a 5th bowl in 2006 made BCS Busters more commonplace.  They also became the first team to repeat in 2008. The [[2004 Utah Utes football team|Utes]] played in the 2005 Tostitos [[Fiesta Bowl]],<ref name="BCSbusterUtah" /> and beat their opponent, the [[2004 Pittsburgh Panthers football team|Pittsburgh Panthers]], 35–7.  During the 2008 season, the [[2008 Utah Utes football team|Utes]] finished their regular season schedule undefeated (8–0 in the Mountain West Conference and 12–0 overall) and earned a berth in the [[2009 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]] against [[2008 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]], winning 31–17. Both the number of Top 25 teams (4) and Top 10 teams (2) Utah defeated that year, equalled the number of such ranked teams defeated by eventual one-loss champion [[2008 Florida Gators football team|Florida]].  That season, no other team besides the Gators or Utes defeated four ranked teams.  Ironically, the strength of schedule argument was often cited by those arguing that Utah did not deserve to be crowned [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|National Champions]].  In the 2011 season, the Utes began competing as members of the [[Pacific-12 Conference]], one of the six conferences with an automatic BCS tie in.  . 

In 2006, [[2006 Boise State Broncos football team|Boise State]] became the second BCS Buster after a 12–0 regular season and subsequent Fiesta Bowl berth against the [[2006 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma Sooners]]. The Broncos [[2007 Fiesta Bowl|won 43–42 in overtime]] in what many fans, pundits and others consider to be one of the best Bowl games in history.  . 

In 2007, [[2007 Hawaii Warriors football team|Hawaii]] also finished the regular season at 12–0, but were defeated by the [[2007 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia Bulldogs]] 41–10 in the [[2008 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]]. This remains the only loss to date by a BCS Buster to an opponent from an automatic qualifying conference.  . 

The 2009 season was the first in which two teams from non–BCS conferences earned BCS bowl berths. [[2009 TCU Horned Frogs football team|TCU]], which finished the regular season 12–0 as champions of the Mountain West, earned the automatic BCS berth with a #4 finish in the final BCS rankings. Two slots behind the Horned Frogs were WAC champions [[2009 Boise State Broncos football team|Boise State]], which finished at 13–0 for its second consecutive unbeaten regular season and fourth in six years. The Broncos defeated the Frogs 17–10 in the [[2010 Fiesta Bowl]], which marked the first BCS matchup between non-AQ schools, and the first time in BCS history that two unbeaten teams met in a BCS game other than the title match. This pairing created considerable controversy as the BCS Conferences and the selection committees were accused of cowardice, pairing the two BCS Busters against each other so that the risk of BCS Conference teams losing was eliminated. This game remains a controversial saga in the history of the BCS.  . 

In 2010, [[2010 TCU Horned Frogs football team|TCU]] was the only non–BCS conference team to get a BCS bowl berth. [[2010 Boise State Broncos football team|Boise State]] was ranked in the top five for most of the season, but a late-season overtime loss to [[2010 Nevada Wolf Pack football team|Nevada]] knocked the Broncos out of serious contention for a BCS bowl bid, despite having still been technically eligible for one.  TCU would defeat Wisconsin 21–19 in the [[2011 Rose Bowl]], once again calling into question the claim of BCS Conference superiority, and doing so with an entirely new level of quality of play. There was a strong movement to lobby those voting in the AP poll, which is not bound to vote for the BCS Championship winner as the Coaches Poll is, to vote TCU first and split the National Championship. While TCU got a few first place votes, this effort did not change the outcome of the AP poll, with TCU ending up the season in the #2 spot in all of the major polls and the BCS rankings. As [[Utah Utes football|Utah]] did, [[TCU Horned Frogs football|TCU]] will soon join a conference with an automatic BCS tie in when they join the [[Big 12 Conference]] beginning with the 2012 season.  . 

BCS Busters are currently 5–2 in BCS bowls, and 4–1 in BCS bowls against opponents from BCS conferences.  . 

The following table shows all 19 teams that were eligible to become BCS Busters, including the seven that succeeded.  .
