[[Poverty]] is the state of human beings who are poor. That is, they have little or no material means of surviving—little or no food, shelter, clothes, healthcare, education, and other physical means of living and improving one's life. Some definitions of poverty, are relative, rather than absolute, poverty reduction would not be considered to apply to measures which resulted in absolute decreases in living standards, but tecnhnically lifted people out of poverty.  . 

Poverty reduction measures are those that raise, or are intended to raise, the material level of living. Of course, some people undertake [[poverty|voluntary poverty]] due to religious or philosophical beliefs. For example, Christian monks and nuns take a [[religious vows|"vow of poverty"]] by which they renounce luxury. Poverty reduction measures have no role in regard to voluntary poverty.  . 

Poverty reduction measures and other attempts to change the economies of modern [[hunter-gatherer]]s are not addressed in this article. Hunter-gatherers, also called "foragers" live off wild plants and animals, for example, the [[Hadza people]] of Tanzania and the [[Bushmen]] of southern Africa. Theirs is a special case in which their poverty relative to the [[developed country|developed countries]] is intertwined with their traditional way of life. Governmental attempts to modernize the economies of the [[Hadza people]], the [[Bushmen]], and other hunter-gatherers have resulted in political, legal, and cultural controversies. They have often met with failure.  . 

Poverty occurs in both [[developing country|developing countries]] and [[developed country|developed countries]]. While poverty is much more widespread in developing countries, both types of countries undertake poverty reduction measures.  . 

Poverty has historically been accepted as inevitable as non-industrialized economies produced very little while populations grew almost as fast making wealth scarce. <ref>"Under traditional (i.e., nonindustrialized) modes of economic production, widespread poverty had been accepted as inevitable. The total output of goods and services, even if equally distributed, would still have been insufficient to give the entire population a comfortable standard of living by prevailing standards. With the economic productivity that resulted from industrialization, however, this ceased to be the case" [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], "Poverty"</ref> Geoffrey Parker wrote that "In [[Antwerp]] and [[Lyon]], two of the largest cities in western Europe, by 1600 three-quarters of the total population were too poor to pay taxes, and therefore likely to need relief in times of crisis."<ref>[[Geoffrey Parker (historian)|Geoffrey Parker]] (2001).

Today, continued economic development is constrained by the lack of [[economic freedom]]s. Economic liberalization requires extending [[property rights]] to the poor, especially to [[land rights|land]]. <ref name=landrights>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3006562.stm Land rights help fight poverty]</ref> [[Financial services]], notably [[savings]], can be made accessible to the poor through technology, such as [[mobile banking]]. <ref name=time.com>http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1918733,00.html Microfinance’s next step: deposits</ref><ref name=safaricom>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8194241.stm Africa’s mobile banking revolution</ref> Inefficient institutions, corruption and political instability can also discourage investment. [[Aid]] and government support in health, education and [[infrastructure]] helps growth by increasing [[human capital|human]] and [[physical capital]]. <ref name=krugman/> . 

Poverty alleviation also involves improving the living conditions of people who are already poor. [[Aid]], particularly in medical and scientific areas, is essential in providing better lives, such as the [[Green Revolution]] and the eradication of [[smallpox]]. <ref name=newsweek/><ref name=aid>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4210122.stm Why aid does work]</ref> Problems with today's [[development aid]] include the high proportion of [[tied aid]], which mandates receiving nations to buy products, often more expensive, originating only from donor countries. <ref name=tiedaid/> Nevertheless, some believe ([[Peter Singer]] in his book [[The Life You Can Save]]) that small changes in the way each of us in affluent nations lives our lives could solve world poverty.  . 

==Economic liberalization==. 
Extending property rights protection to the poor is one of the most important poverty reduction strategies a nation can implement. <ref name=cato/> Securing property rights to land, the largest asset for most societies, is vital to their economic freedom. <ref name=cato/><ref name=newsweek>http://www.newsweek.com/id/160070 How to spread democracy</ref> The [[World Bank]] concludes that increasing land rights is ‘the key to reducing poverty’ citing that land rights greatly increase poor people’s wealth, in some cases doubling it. <ref name=landrights>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3006562.stm Land rights help fight poverty</ref> It is estimated that state recognition of the property of the poor would give them assets worth 40 times all the foreign aid since 1945. <ref name=cato/> Although approaches varied, the [[World Bank]] said the key issues were security of tenure and ensuring land transactions were low cost. <ref name=landrights/> In China and [[India]], noted reductions in poverty in recent decades have occurred mostly as a result of the abandonment of [[collective farming]] in China and the cutting of government red tape in India. <ref name=bbc1>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5407770.stm Can aid bring an end to poverty65]</ref> . 

New enterprises and foreign investment can be driven away by the results of inefficient institutions, corruption, the weak rule of law and excessive bureaucratic burdens. <ref name=cato/><ref name=krugman/> It takes two days, two bureaucratic procedures, and $280 to open a business in Canada while an entrepreneur in Bolivia must pay $2,696 in fees, wait 82 business days, and go through 20 procedures to do the same. <ref name=cato/> Such costly barriers favor big firms at the expense of small enterprises where most jobs are created. <ref name=cato/> In [[India]] before economic reforms, businesses had to bribe government officials even for routine activities, which was in effect a tax on business. <ref name=krugman/> . 

However, ending government sponsorship of social programs is sometimes advocated as a [[free market]] principle with tragic consequences. For example, the [[World Bank]] presses poor nations to eliminate subsidies for [[fertilizer]] that many farmers cannot afford at market prices. The reconfiguration of public financing in former [[Soviet]] states during their [[transition economy|transition to a market economy]] called for reduced spending on health and education, sharply increasing poverty. <ref name=malawi/><ref>''Transition: The First Ten Years – Analysis and Lessons for Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union'', The World Bank, Washington, DC, 2002, p. 4. </ref><ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E0D8163FF931A25753C1A9669C8B63 Study Finds Poverty Deepening in Former Communist Countries]".

Trade liberalization increases total surplus of trading nations. [[Remittance]]s sent to poor countries, such as [[India]], are sometimes larger than [[foreign direct investment]] and total [[remittances]] are more than double [[aid]] flows from [[OECD]] countries. <ref name=remittance>[http://www.economist.com/research/articlesBySubject/displaystory.cfm?subjectid=894664&story_id=14586906 Migration and development: The aid workers who really help]</ref> Foreign investment and export industries helped fuel the economic expansion of [[Four Asian Tigers|fast growing Asian nation]]s. <ref name=vogel991>Vogel, Ezra F. 1991.

==Capital, infrastructure and technology==. 
[[File:World GDP Per Capita 1500 to 2000, Log Scale.png|200px|thumb|World GDP per capita (log scale)]]
[[Image:World GDP per capita 1500 to 2003.png|200px|thumb|World GDP per capita]]
Long run economic growth per person is achieved through increases in capital (factors that increase productivity), both human and physical, and technology. <ref name=krugman/> Improving [[human capital]], in the form of health, is needed for economic growth. Nations do not necessarily need wealth to gain health. <ref>[http://www.dcp2.org/main/Home.html Disease Control Priorities Project]</ref> For example, [[Sri Lanka]] had a [[maternal mortality rate]] of 2% in the 1930s, higher than any nation today. <ref name=post>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/02/AR2006040200813.html Saving millions for just a few dollars]</ref> It reduced it to .5-.6% in the 1950s and to 0.6% today. <ref name=post/> However, it was spending less each year on [[maternal health]] because it learned what worked and what did not. <ref name=post/> Knowledge on the cost effectiveness of healthcare interventions can be elusive but educational measures to disseminate what works are available, such as the disease control priorities project.[http://www.dcp2.org/main/Home.html] Promoting hand washing is one of the most cost effective health intervention and can cut [[child mortality|death]]s from the major childhood diseases of [[diarrhea]] and [[pneumonia]] by half. <ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7670855.stm Millions mark UN hand washing day</ref> . 

Human capital, in the form of education, is an even more important determinant of economic growth than physical capital. <ref name=krugman/> [[Deworming]] children costs about 50 cents per child per year and reduces non-attendance from [[anemia]], illness and [[malnutrition]] and is only a twenty-fifth as expensive to increase school attendance as by constructing schools. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/22/books/review/Kristof-t.html?_r=1&ref=global- How can we help the world’s poor]</ref> . 

UN economists argue that good infrastructure, such as roads and information networks, helps market reforms to work. <ref name=bbc2/> China claims it is investing in railways, roads, ports and rural telephones in African countries as part of its formula for economic development. <ref name=bbc2>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolpda/ukfs_news/hi/newsid_6079000/6079838.stm China becomes Africa's suitor]</ref> It was the technology of the [[steam engine]] that originally began the dramatic decreases in poverty levels. Cell phone technology brings the market to poor or rural sections. <ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0604/p01s02-woaf.html?page=2 Give cash not food]</ref> With necessary information, remote farmers can produce specific crops to sell to the buyers that brings the best price. <ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0223/p01s04-woaf.html Market approach recasts often-hungry Ethiopia as potential bread basket]</ref> . 

Such technology also helps bring economic freedom by making [[financial services]] accessible to the poor. Those in poverty place overwhelming importance on having a safe place to [[savings|save]] money, much more so than receiving loans. <ref name="time.com"/> Also, a large part of [[microfinance]] loans are spent on products that would usually be paid by a [[checking account|checking]] or [[savings account]]. <ref name=time.com/> [[Mobile banking]] addresses the problem of the heavy regulation and costly maintenance of [[saving account]]s. <ref name=time.com/> Mobile financial services in the [[developing world]], ahead of the [[developed world]] in this respect, could be worth $5 billion by 2012. <ref name=m-banking>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8100388.stm Africa pioneers mobile bank push</ref> [[Safaricom]]’s [[M-Pesa]] launched one of the first systems where a network of agents of mostly shopkeepers, instead of bank branches, would take [[Deposit account|deposits]] in cash and translate these onto a virtual account on customers' phones. [[Cash]] transfers can be done between phones and issued back in cash with a small commission, making [[remittance]]s safer. <ref name="safaricom"/> . 

==Employment and Productivity==. 
Economic growth has the indirect potential to alleviate poverty, as a result of a simultaneous increase in employment opportunities and increase [[labour productivity]]. <ref name=ODI2>Claire Melamed, Renate Hartwig and Ursula Grant 2011. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5752&title=jobs-growth-poverty-employment Jobs, growth and poverty: what do we know, what don't we know, what should we know?] London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> A study by researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] (ODI) of 24 countries that experienced growth found that in 18 cases, poverty was alleviated. <ref name=ODI2/> However, employment is no guarantee of escaping poverty, the [[International Labour Organisation]] (ILO) estimates that as many as 40% of workers as poor, not earning enough to keep their families above the $2 a day poverty line. <ref name=ODI2/> For instance, in [[India]] most of the chronically poor are wage earners in formal employment, because their jobs are insecure and low paid and offer no chance to accumulate wealth to avoid risks. <ref name=ODI2/> This appears to be the result of a negative relationship between employment creation and increased productivity, when a simultaneous positive increase is required to reduced poverty. According to the [[UNRISD]], increasing labour productivity appears to have a negative impact on job creation: in the 1960s, a 1% increase in output per worker was associated with a reduction in employment growth of 0.07%, by the first decade of this century the same productivity increase implies reduced employment growth by 0.54%. <ref name=ODI2/> . 

Increases in employment without increases in productivity leads to a rise in the number of "working poor", which is why some experts are now promoting the creation of "quality" and not "quantity" in labour market policies. <ref name=ODI2/> This approach does highlight how higher productivity has helped reduce poverty in East Asia, but the negative impact is beginning to show. <ref name=ODI2/> In [[Viet Nam]], for example, employment growth has slowed while productivity growth has continued. <ref name=ODI2/> Furthermore, productivity increases do not always lead to increased wages, as can be seen in the US, where the gap between productivity and wages has been rising since the 1980s. <ref name=ODI2/> The ODI study showed that other sectors were just as important in reducing unemployment, as [[manufacturing]]. <ref name=ODI2/> The [[services sector]] is most effective at translating productivity growth into employment growth. Agriculture provides a safety net for jobs and economic buffer when other sectors are struggling. <ref name=ODI2/> This study suggests a more nuanced understanding of economic growth and quality of life and poverty alleviation.  . 

===Helping farmers===. 
Raising farm incomes is described as the core of the antipoverty effort as three quarters of the poor today are farmers. 
<ref name=agriculture>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/world/africa/20worldbank.html|title=World Bank report puts agriculture at core of antipoverty effort|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2011-05-27|first=Celia W.|last=Dugger|date=2007-10-20}}</ref> Estimates show that growth in the agricultural productivity of small farmers is, on average, at least twice as effective in benefiting the poorest half of a country’s population as growth generated in nonagricultural sectors.

Improving water management is an effective way to help reduce poverty among farmers. With better water management, they can improve productivity and potentially move beyond subsistence-level farming. During the Green Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, for example, irrigation was a key factor in unlocking Asia's agricultural potential and reducing poverty. Between 1961 and 2002, the irrigated area almost doubled, as governments sought to achieve food security, improve public welfare and generate economic growth. In South Asia, cereal production rose by 137% from 1970 to 2007. This was achieved with only 3% more land. <ref>Mukherji, A. [http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Other/index.aspx Revitalising Asia’s Irrigation: To sustainably meet tomorrow’s food needs] 2009, [[IWMI]] and [[FAO]]</ref> . 

The [[International Water Management Institute]] in [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka]] aims to improve the management of land and water resources for food, livelihoods and the environment. One project its scientists worked on demonstrates the impact that improving water management in agriculture can have. The study, funded by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, initially upgraded and irrigated the irrigation system on the Walawe Left Bank, Sri Lanka, in 1997. In 2005, irrigation was extended to a further area. An analysis of the whole are was carried out in 2007 and 2008. This study found that access to irrigation provided families with opportunities to diversify their livelihood activities and potentially increase their incomes. For example, people with land could reliably grow rice or vegetables instead of working as labourers or relying on rainfall to water their crops. Those without land could benefit by working within new inland fisheries. Within the project's control area, 57% of households were below the poverty line in 2002 compared with 43% in 2007. <ref>[http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/Landing_Pages/WIB8.aspx ''Water, poverty and equity'']. Water Issue Brief, Issue 8, 2010. </ref> . 

==Growth vs. State Intervention: Comparative Perspective in China, India, Brazil==. 
A 2011 World Bank research article, “A Comparative Perspective on Poverty Reduction in Brazil, China, and India,” looked at the three nations’ strategies and their relative challenges and successes. During their reform periods, all three have reduced their poverty rates, but through a different mix of approaches. The report used a common poverty line of $1.25 per person, per day, at purchasing parity power for consumption in 2005. Using that metric and evaluating the period between 1981 and 2005, the poverty rate in China dropped from 84% to 16%; India from 60% to 42%; and Brazil from 17% to 8%. The report sketches an overall scorecard of the countries on the two basic dimensions of pro-poor growth and pro-poor policy intervention: “China clearly scores well on the pro-poor growth side of the card, but neither Brazil nor India do; in Brazil’s case for lack of growth and in India’s case for lack of poverty-reducing growth. Brazil scores well on the social policies side, but China and India do not; in China’s case progress has been slow in implementing new social policies more relevant to the new market economy (despite historical advantages in this area, inherited from the past regime) and in India’s case the bigger problems are the extent of capture of the many existing policies by non-poor groups and the weak capabilities of the state for delivering better basic public services.”<ref>{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/international/poverty-reduction-brazil-china-india/ |title = Comparative Perspective on Poverty Reduction in Brazil, China, and India |publisher=Journalist's Resource.org }}</ref> . 

==Aid==. 
{{main|Aid}} . 

===Welfare===. 
{{Main|Welfare's effect on poverty}}
Aid in its simplest form is a [[basic income grant]], a form of [[social security]] periodically providing citizens with money. In pilot projects in [[Namibia]], where such a program pays just $13 a month, people were able to pay [[tuition]] fees, raising the proportion of children going to school by 92%, child [[malnutrition]] rates fell from 42% to 10% and economic activity grew 10%. <ref name=Spiegel>http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,642310,00.html A new approach to aid: How a basic income program saved a Namibian village</ref><ref name="Namibians line up">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7415814.stm Namibians line up for free cash</ref> Aid could also be rewarded based on doing certain requirements. [[Conditional Cash Transfer]]s, widely credited as a successful anti-poverty program, is based on actions such as enrolling children in school or receiving [[vaccination]]s. <ref name=Brazil>[http://origin.csmonitor.com/2008/1113/p01s03-woam.html?page=1 Brazil becomes antipoverty showcase]</ref> In [[Mexico]], for example, the country with the largest such program, dropout rates of 16–19 year olds in rural area dropped by 20% and children gained half an inch in height. <ref name=csm>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0921/p06s10-woam.html Latin America makes dent in poverty with ‘conditional cash’ programs]</ref> Initial fears that the program would encourage families to stay at home rather than work to collect benefits have proven to be unfounded. Instead, there is less excuse for neglectful behavior as, for example, children are prevented from begging on the streets instead of going to school because it could result in suspension from the program. <ref name=csm/> . 

[[Welfare states]] have an effect on poverty reduction. Currently modern, expansive welfare states that ensure economic opportunity, independence and security in a near universal manner are still the exclusive domain of the [[Developed countries|developed nations]]. <ref name="Esping-Andersen">Esping-Andersen, G. (1990). ''The three worlds of welfare capitalism''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. </ref> commonly constituting at least 20% of GDP, with the largest [[Scandinavia]]n welfare states constituting over 40% of GDP. <ref name="Barr">Barr, N. (2004). ''The economics of the welfare state''. New York: Oxford University Press (USA). </ref> These modern welfare states, which largely arose in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, seeing their greatest expansion in the mid 20th century, and have proven themselves highly effective in reducing relative as well as absolute poverty in all analyzed high-income OECD countries. <ref name="Kenworthy">Kenworthy, L.

Philosopher [[Thomas Pogge]] is a supporter of gathering funds for the poor by using a sort of [[Global Resources Dividend]].  . 

===Development aid===. 
{{See also|Development aid|Tied aid}}
A major proportion of aid from donor nations is ‘tied’, mandating that a receiving nation buy products originating only from the donor country. <ref name=tiedaid>[http://ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=24509 Tied aid strangling nations, says UN]</ref> This can be harmful economically. <ref name=tiedaid/> For example, [[Eritrea]] is forced to spend aid money on foreign goods and services to build a network of railways even though it is cheaper to use local expertise and resources. <ref name=tiedaid/> Money from the United States to fight AIDS requires it be spent on U.S brand name drugs that can cost up to $15,000 a year compared to $350 a year for [[generic drug|generics]] from other countries. <ref name=tiedaid/> Only [[Norway]], Denmark, [[Netherlands]] and Britain have stopped tying their aid. <ref name=tiedaid/> . 

Some [[think tanks]] and NGOs have argued that Western monetary aid often only serves to increase poverty and social inequality, either because it is conditioned with the implementation of harmful economic policies in the recipient countries,<ref>[http://www.heritagekonpa.com/archives/Haiti;s%20rice%20farmers%20suffered%20since%20trade%20barrier%20in%201994.htm Haiti's rice farmers and poultry growers have suffered greatly since trade barriers were lowered in 1994.] By Jane Regan</ref> or because it's tied with the importing of products from the donor country over cheaper alternatives. <ref name=tiedaid/> Sometimes foreign aid is seen to be serving the interests of the donor more than the recipient,<ref>[http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Debt/USAid.asp US and Foreign Aid], GlobalIssues.org</ref> and critics also argue that some of the foreign aid is stolen by corrupt governments and officials, and that higher aid levels erode the quality of governance. Policy becomes much more oriented toward what will get more aid money than it does towards meeting the needs of the people. <ref name="ABC-myth">[http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=1955664&page=1 MYTH: More Foreign Aid Will End Global Poverty]</ref> Problems with the aid system and not aid itself are that the aid is excessively directed towards the salaries of consultants from donor countries, the aid is not spread properly, neglecting vital, less publicized area such as agriculture, and the aid is not properly coordinated among donors, leading to a plethora of disconnected projects rather than unified strategies. <ref name=aid/> . 

Supporters of aid argue that these problems may be solved with better [[audit]]ing of how the aid is used. <ref name="ABC-myth" /> Immunization campaigns for children, such as against [[polio]], [[diphtheria]] and [[measles]] have save millions of lives. <ref name=aid/> Aid from non-governmental organizations may be more effective than governmental aid; this may be because it is better at reaching the poor and better controlled at the grassroots level. <ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=1955664&page=1 Does Foreign Aid Reduce Poverty? Empirical Evidence from Nongovernmental and Bilateral Aid]</ref> As a point of comparison, the annual world military spending is over $1 trillion. <ref>[http://yearbook2006.sipri.org/ SIPRI Yearbook 2006]</ref> . 

===Debt relief===. 
{{See also|Debt relief}}
One of the proposed ways to help poor countries that emerged during the [[Brady Plan|1980s]] has been [[debt relief]]. Given that many less developed nations have gotten themselves into extensive debt to banks and governments from the rich nations, and given that the interest payments on these debts are often more than a country can generate per year in profits from exports, cancelling part or all of these debts may allow poor nations "to get out of the hole". <ref>World Bank and International Monetary Fund. 2001. ''Heavily Indebted Poor Countries, Progress Report.'' Retrieved from http://worldbank.org. </ref> If poor countries do not have to spend so much on debt payments, they can use the money instead for priorities which help reduce poverty such as basic health-care and education. <ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4081220.stm African debt relief</ref> Many nations began offering services, such as free health care even while overwhelming the health care infrastructure, because of savings that resulted from the rounds of [[debt relief]] in 2005. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4883062.stm Zambia overwhelmed by free health care]</ref> . 

== The role of education and skillbuilding as precursors to economic development ==. 
Universal public education has some role in preparing youth for basic academic skills and perhaps many trade skills, as well. Apprenticeships clearly build needed trade skills. If modest amounts of cash and land can be combined with a modicum of agricultural skills in a temperate climate, subsistence can give way toward modest societal wealth. As has been mentioned, education for women will allow for reduced family size—an important poverty reduction event in its own right. While all components mentioned above are necessary, the portion of education pertaining to the variety of skills needed to build and maintain the infrastructure of a developing (moving out of poverty) society: building trades; plumbing; electrician; well-drilling; farm and transport mechanical skills (and others) are clearly needed in large numbers of individuals, if the society is to move out of poverty or subsistence. Yet, many well-developed western economies are moving strongly away from the essential apprenticeships and skill training which affords a clear vocational path out of modern urban poverty.  . 

===Microloans===. 
{{See also|Microfinance}}
One of the most popular of the new technical tools for economic development and poverty reduction are microloans made famous in 1976 by the [[Grameen Bank]] in Bangladesh. The idea is to loan small amounts of money to farmers or villages so these people can obtain the things they need to increase their economic rewards. A small pump costing only $50 could make a very big difference in a village without the means of [[irrigation]], for example. A couple of hundred dollars for a small bridge linking a village to a city where it can market farm products is another example. <ref>http://microcreditsummit.org</ref><ref>http://www.grameen-info.org</ref> A specific example is the [[Thailand|Thai]] government's People's Bank which is making loans of $100 to $300 to help farmers buy equipment or seeds, help street vendors acquire an inventory to sell, or help others set up small shops. [[IFAD|The International Fund for Agricultural Development]] [[IFAD Vietnam|(IFAD) Vietnam]] country programme supports operations in 11 poor provinces. Between 2002 and 2010 around 1,000 saving and credit groups (SCGs) were formed, with over 17,000 members; these SCGs increased their access to [[microcredit]] for taking up small-scale farm activities. <ref>RIDP, PCR and Validation, 2010. </ref> . 

==Empowering women==. 
The [[empowerment]] of women has relatively recently become a significant area of discussion with respect to development and economics; however it is often regarded as a topic that only addresses and primarily deals with [[gender inequality]]. Because women and men experience poverty differently, they hold dissimilar poverty reduction priorities and are affected differently by development interventions and poverty reduction strategies. <ref name="ReferenceA">Zuckerman, Elaine. 2002 “Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers and Gender”. Berlin, Germany: Conference on Sustainable Poverty Reduction and PRSPs. </ref> In response to the socialized phenomenon known as the [[feminization of poverty]], policies aimed to reduce poverty have begun to address poor women separately from poor men. <ref name="ReferenceA"/> In addition to engendering poverty and poverty interventions, a correlation between greater gender equality and greater poverty reduction and economic growth has been illustrated by research through the [[World Bank]], suggesting that promoting [[gender equality]] through empowerment of women is a qualitatively significant poverty reduction strategy. <ref>World Bank. 2001a “Engendering Development: Through Gender Equality in Rights, Resources, and Voice”. Policy Research Report. Oxford University Press. </ref> . 

===Gender equality===. 
Addressing gender equality and empowering women are necessary steps in overcoming poverty and furthering development as supported by the human development and [[capabilities approach]] and the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. <ref>U.N. General Assembly, 55th Session. “United Nations Millennium Declaration.” (A/55/L.2). 8 September 2000. </ref> Disparities in the areas of education, [[mortality rates]], health and other social and economic indicators impose large costs on well-being and health of the poor, which diminishes productivity and the potential to reduce poverty. <ref name="ReferenceA"/> The limited opportunities of women in most societies restrict their aptitude to improve economic conditions and access services to enhance their well-being. <ref name="ReferenceA"/> . 

====Mainstreaming gender====. 
[[Gender mainstreaming]], the concept of placing gender issues into the mainstream of society, was established by the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women as a global strategy for promoting gender equality; the UN conference emphasized the necessity to ensure that gender equality is a primary goal in all areas of social and economic development, which includes the discussion of poverty and its reduction. <ref>International Labour Organization. 1996. “Definition of Gender Mainstreaming” <http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/gender/newsite2002/about/defin.htm></ref> Correspondingly, the [[World Bank]] also created objectives to address poverty with respect to the different effects on women. <ref name="Muwanigwa, Virginia 2002">Muwanigwa, Virginia. 2002. “Gender Considerations in Poverty Alleviation”. Harere, Zimbabwe. </ref> One important goal was the revision of laws and administrative practices to ensure women’s equal rights and access to economic resources. <ref name="Muwanigwa, Virginia 2002"/> Mainstreaming strengthens women’s active involvement in poverty alleviation by linking women’s capabilities and contributions with macro-economic issues. <ref name="Muwanigwa, Virginia 2002"/>  The underlying purpose of both the UN and World Bank policies speaks to the use of discussion of gender issues in the promotion of gender equality and reduction of poverty.  . 

===Strategies to empower women===. 
Several platforms have been adopted and reiterated across many organizations in support of the empowerment of women with the specific aim of reducing poverty. Encouraging more economic and political participation by women increases financial independence from and social investment in the government, both of which are critical to pulling society out of poverty. <ref>Narayan, Deepa and Nicholas Stern. 2002. “Empowerment and Poverty Reduction: A Sourcebook”, pp. 1–272. Washington DC: World Bank. </ref> . 

====Economic participation====. 
Women’s [[economic empowerment]], or ensuring that women and men have equal opportunities to generate and manage income, is an important step to enhancing their development within the household and in society. <ref name="UNICEF 2007. pp. 36">UNICEF. 2007. “Equality in Employment,” in The State of the World’s Children, pp. 36–49. New York: UNICEF. </ref> Additionally, women play an important economic role in addressing poverty experienced by children. <ref name="UNICEF 2007. pp. 36"/> By increasing female participation in the [[labor force]], women are able to contribute more effectively to economic growth and [[income distribution]] since having a source of income elevates their financial and social status. <ref name="UNICEF 2007. pp. 36"/> However, women’s entry into the paid labor force does not necessarily equate to reduction of poverty; the creation of decent employment opportunities and movement of women from the informal work sector to the formal labor market are key to poverty reduction. <ref>Chen, Martha, Joann Vanek, Francie Lund, James Heintz with Renana Jhabvala, and Christine Bonner. 2005. “Employment, Gender, and Poverty,” in Progress of the World’s Women, pp. 36–57. New York: United Nations Development Fund for Women. </ref> Other ways to encourage female participation in the workforce to promote decline of poverty include providing childcare services, increasing educational quality and opportunities, and furthering [[entrepreneurship]] for women. <ref name="UNICEF 2007. pp. 36"/>
Protection of [[property rights]] is a key element in economically empowering women and fostering economic growth overall for both genders. With legitimate claims to land, women gain bargaining power, which can be applied to their lives outside of and within the household. <ref>Agarwal, Bina. 1994. “Land Rights for Women: Making the Case,” in A Field of One’s Own: Gender and Land Rights in South Asia, pp. 1–50. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press. </ref> The ability and opportunity for women to lawfully own land also decreases the asset gap that exists between women and men, which promotes gender equality. <ref name="UNICEF 2007. pp. 36"/> . 

====Political participation====. 
Political participation is supported by organizations such as IFAD as one pillar of gender equality and women’s empowerment. <ref>IFAD. 2007. “Strategy and Approach: Gender equality and women’s empowerment”. 21 Mar. 2011. <http://www.ifad.org/gender/approach/index.htm>. </ref> Sustainable economic growth requires poor people to have influence on the decisions that affect their lives; specifically strengthening women’s voices in the political process builds social independence and greater consideration of gender issues in policy. <ref>IFAD. 2007. “Strategy and Approach: Gender equality and women’s empowerment”. 21 Mar. 2011. <http://www.ifad.org/gender/approach/index.htm>. </ref> In order to promote women’s political empowerment, the [[United Nations Development Programme]] advocated for several efforts: increase women in public office; strengthen advocate ability of women’s organizations; ensure fair legal protection; and provide equivalent health and education. <ref>“Women's Empowerment – UNDP Democratic Governance Group Focus Area.” UNDP | United Nations Development Programme. Web. 21 Mar. 2011. <http://www.undp.org/governance/focus_womens_empowerment.shtml>. </ref> Fair political representation and participation enable women to lobby for more female-specific poverty reduction policies and programs.  . 

==Good institutions==. 
{{See also|Political corruption}}
Efficient institutions that are not corrupt and obey the [[rule of law]] make and enforce good laws that provide security to property and businesses. Efficient and fair governments would work to invest in the long-term interests of the nation rather than plunder resources through corruption. <ref name=krugman/> Researchers at [[UC Berkeley]] developed what they called a "Weberianness scale" which measures aspects of [[bureaucracies]] and governments which [[Max Weber]] described as most important for [[rational-legal authority|rational-legal]] and efficient government over 100 years ago. Comparative research has found that the scale is correlated with higher rates of economic development. <ref>Evans, Peter, and James E. Rauch. 1999. "Bureaucracy and Growth: A Cross-National Analysis of the Effects of 'Weberian' State Structures on Economic Growth." ''American Sociological Review'', 64:748–765. </ref> With their related concept of good governance [[World Bank]] researchers have found much the same: Data from 150 nations have shown several measures of good governance (such as accountability, effectiveness, rule of law, low corruption) to be related to higher rates of economic development.

Funds from [[aid]] and [[natural resources]] are often diverted into private hands and then sent to banks overseas as a result of graft. <ref name=economist>[http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13278728 Banks, graft and development]</ref> If Western banks rejected stolen money, says a report by [[Global Witness]], ordinary people would benefit “in a way that aid flows will never achieve”. <ref name=economist/> The report asked for more regulation of banks as they have proved capable of stanching the flow of funds linked to terrorism, [[money-laundering]] or [[tax evasion]]. <ref name=economist/> . 

Some, like [[Thomas Pogge]], call for a global organization that can manage some form of [[Global Resources Dividend]], which could evolve in complexity with time.  . 

Examples of good governance leading to economic development and poverty reduction include [[Thailand]], Taiwan, [[Malaysia]], South Korea, and [[Vietnam]], which tend to have a strong government, called a ''hard state'' or ''[[development state]]''. These “hard states” have the will and authority to create and maintain policies that lead to long-term development that helps all their citizens, not just the wealthy. Multinational corporations are regulated so that they follow reasonable standards for [[wage|pay]] and labor conditions, pay reasonable taxes to help develop the country, and keep some of the profits in the country, reinvesting them to provide further development.  . 

The [[United Nations Development Program]] published a report in April 2000 which focused on good governance in poor countries as a key to economic development and overcoming the selfish interests of wealthy elites often behind state actions in developing nations. The report concludes that “Without [[good governance]], reliance on [[trickle-down economics|trickle-down]] economic development and a host of other strategies will not work.”<ref name="undp2000">United Nations Development Report. 2000. ''Overcoming Human Poverty: UNDP Poverty Report 2000.'' New York: United Nations Publications. </ref> Despite the promise of such research several questions remain, such as where good governance comes from and how it can be achieved. The comparative analysis of one sociologist<ref name=kerbo>Kerbo, Harold. 2006. World Poverty in the 21st century. New York: McGraw-Hill. </ref> suggests that broad historical forces have shaped the likelihood of good governance. Ancient civilizations with more developed government organization before [[colonialism]], as well as elite responsibility, have helped create strong states with the means and efficiency to carry out development policies today. On the other hand strong states are not always the form of political organization most conducive to economic development. Other historical factors, especially the experiences of colonialism for each country, have intervened to make a strong state and/or good governance less likely for some countries, especially in Africa. Another important factor that has been found to affect the quality of institutions and governance was the pattern of colonization (how it took place) and even the identity of colonizing power. International agencies may be able to promote good governance through various policies of intervention in developing nations as indicated in a few African countries, but comparative analysis suggests it may be much more difficult to achieve in most poor nations around the world. <ref name=kerbo>Kerbo, Harold. 2006. World Poverty, in the 21st century. New York: McGraw-Hill. </ref> . 

==Other approaches== . 

Another approach that has been proposed for alleviating poverty is [[Fair Trade]] which advocates the payment of an above market price as well as social and environmental standards in areas related to the production of goods. The efficacy of this approach to poverty reduction is controversial.  . 

Community and monetary economist [[Thomas H. Greco, Jr.]] has argued that the mainstream [[international finance|global economy]] with its debt-based currency has built-in structural incentives that create poverty through keeping money scarce. Greco points to the success of modern [[barter]] clubs and historical local currencies such as the [[Wörgl Experiment]] at revitalizing stagnant local economies, and calls for the creation of [[community currency]] as a means to reduce or eliminate poverty. <ref>Thomas Greco, Jr., ''Money Understanding and Creating Alternatives to Legal Tender'', Chelsea Green Publishing, 2001. ISBN 9781890132378. </ref> . 

The [[Toronto Dollar]] is an example of a [[local currency]] oriented towards reducing poverty. Toronto Dollars are sold and redeemed in such a way that raise funds which are then given as grants to local charities, primarily ones oriented towards reducing poverty. <ref name="milestone">[http://www.thestar.com/printArticle/347455 Barbara Turnbull, "Milestone for the `Toronto Dollar'", ''Toronto Star'', 22 Mar. 2008.]</ref> Toronto Dollars also provide a means to create an [[incentive]] for welfare recipients to work: Toronto dollars can be given as gifts to welfare recipients who perform volunteer work for charitable and non-profit organizations, and these gifts do not affect welfare benefits. <ref>[http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/view/58941 Mark Herpel, "The Toronto Dollar: Community Alternative Dollar", ''California Chronicle'', 18 Apr. 2008.]</ref> . 

Some have argued for radical economic change in the system. There are several fundamental proposals for restructuring existing economic relations, and many of their supporters argue that their ideas would reduce or even eliminate poverty entirely if they were implemented. Such proposals have been put forward by both left-wing and right-wing groups: socialism, communism, [[anarchism]], [[libertarianism]], [[binary economics]] and [[participatory economics]], among others.  . 

Inequality can be reduced by [[progressive taxation]], [[wealth tax]], and [[inheritance tax]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} . 

In law, there has been a move to establish the absence of poverty as a [[human right]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} . 

The IMF and member countries have produced [[Poverty Reduction Strategy]] papers or PRSPs. <ref>[http://www.imf.org/external/np/prsp/prsp.asp Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP)]</ref> . 

In his book [http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/endofpoverty/ "The End of Poverty"],<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1034738,00.html The End of Poverty] by JEFFREY D. SACHS for time.com</ref> a prominent economist named [[Jeffrey Sachs]] laid out a plan to eradicate global poverty by the year 2025. Following his recommendations, international organizations such as the [http://www.globalsolidaritynetwork.org Global Solidarity Network] are working to help eradicate poverty worldwide with intervention in the areas of housing, food, education, basic health, agricultural inputs, safe drinking water, transportation and communications.  . 

The [[Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign]] is an organization in the United States working to secure freedom from poverty for all by organizing the poor themselves. The Campaign believes that a human rights framework, based on the value of inherent dignity and worth of all persons, offers the best means by which to organize for a political solution to poverty.Makes camps of antipoverty.  . 

===Climate change adaptation===. 
Researcher at a leading global think-tank, the [[Overseas Development Institute]], suggests that far more effort should be done to better coordinate and integrate [[Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper|poverty reduction strategies]] with climate change adaptation. <ref name=ODI>Martin Prowse, Natasha Grist and Cheikh Sourang (2009) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=3290&title=climate-change-poverty-strategies Closing the gap between climate adaptation and poverty reduction frameworks] London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> The two issues are argued to be currently only dealt with in parallel as most poverty reduction strategy papers ignore climate change adaptation altogether, while National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) likewise do not deal directly with poverty reduction. Adaptation-poverty linkages were found to be strongest in NAPAs from sub-Saharan Africa LDCs. <ref name=ODI/> . 

===Bicycles===. 
Experiments done in Africa ([[Uganda]] and [[Tanzania]]) and [[Sri Lanka]] on hundreds of households have shown that a bicycle can increase the income of a poor family by as much as 35%. <ref>{{cite web

For example, road investments in India were a staggering 3–10 times more effective than almost all other investments and subsidies in rural economy in the decade of 1990s. What a road does at a macro level to increase transport, the bicycle supports at the micro level. The bicycle, in that sense, can be one of the best means to eradicate poverty in poor nations.  .
