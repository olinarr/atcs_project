In [[international relations]], '''aid''' (also known as '''international aid''', '''overseas aid''', or '''foreign aid''') is a voluntary transfer of [[resources]] from one [[country]] to another, given at least partly with the objective of benefiting the recipient country. <!--
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Long REFERENCE begins: . 

--><ref>The Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development defines its aid measure, Official Development Assistance (ODA), as follows: "ODA consists of flows to developing countries and multilateral institutions provided by official agencies, including state and local governments,
or by their executive agencies, each transaction of which meets the
following test: a) it is administered with the promotion of the economic
development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective,
and b) it is concessional in character and contains a grant element of at
least 25% (calculated at a rate of discount of 10%)." (OECD, ''The DAC in Dates'', 2006. Section, "1972".)
<P>
Former USAID official Carol Lancaster, in her book ''Foreign Aid'' (2007) defines foreign aid as: "a voluntary transfer of public resources, from a government to another independent government, to an NGO, or to an international organization (such as the World Bank or the UN Development Program) with at least a 25 percent grant element, one goal of which is to better the human condition in the country receiving the aid." (p 9.)
<P>
Both definitions employ the concept that benefit to the people of the receiving country must be one but not necessarily the only objective.

It may have other functions as well: it may be given as a signal of [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] approval, or to strengthen a [[military]] [[Allies|ally]], to reward a [[government]] for behaviour desired by the [[Donation|donor]], to extend the donor's cultural influence, to provide [[infrastructure]] needed by the donor for resource extraction from the recipient country, or to gain other kinds of [[commerce|commercial]] access. <ref>Lancaster, p 13, writes, "For much of the period of this study [World War Two to the present] foreign aid was used for four main purposes: diplomatic [in which she includes a government's international security and political interests abroad], developmental, humanitarian relief and commercial."
</ref>  
[[Humanitarianism]] and [[altruism]] are, nevertheless, significant [[motivation]]s for the giving of aid. <ref>Lancaster, pp 4, 5. </ref>  . 

Aid may be given by individuals, private organisations, or governments. Standards delimiting exactly the kinds of transfers that count as aid vary. For example, aid figures may or may not include transfers for military use: to cite one instance, the United States included military assistance in its aid figure until 1957 but no longer does. <ref>Lancaster, p 67: "In 1957 the administration (with congressional support) separated economic from military assistance and created a Development Loan Fund (DLF) to provide concessional credits to developing countries world-wide (i.e. not, as in the past, just those in areas of potential conflict with Moscow) to promote their long-term growth. </ref>
The most widely used measure of aid, "[[Official Development Assistance]]" (ODA) is such a figure. It is compiled by the [[Development Assistance Committee]] of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]. The [[United Nations]], the [[World Bank]], and many [[scholar]]s use the DAC's ODA figure as their main aid figure because it is easily available and reasonably consistently calculated over time and between countries. <ref>Lancaster uses either ODA or ODA plus OA ("Official Assistance" -- another DAC government-aid category) as her main statistic. She considers it better to add the OA but very often just uses the ODA figure alone; eg., for Table 1.1 (p 13), Table 2.2 (p 39) and Table 2.3 (p 43). In any case the difference is now moot since the DAC recently merged the two categories.

The DAC consists of 22 of the wealthiest Western industrialised countries plus the [[European Union|EU]]; it is a forum in which they
coordinate their aid policies.  .

===Humanitarian aid===. 
{{main|Humanitarian aid}}
Humanitarian aid or ''emergency aid'' is rapid assistance given to people in immediate distress by individuals, organisations, or governments to relieve suffering, during and after man-made emergencies (like [[war]]s) and [[natural disaster]]s. The term often carries an international connotation, but this is not always the case. It is often distinguished from [[development aid]] by being focussed on relieving suffering caused by natural disaster or conflict, rather than removing the root causes of poverty or vulnerability. 
[[File:Flickr - The U.S. Army - Humanitarian aid in Rajan Kala, Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|U.S. Soldiers unload humanitarian aid for distribution to the town of Rajan Kala, Afghanistan, Dec. 5, 2009]]
The provision of [[humanitarian aid]] or [[humanitarian response]] consists of the provision of vital services (such as food aid to prevent [[starvation]]) by aid agencies, and the provision of funding or in-kind services (like logistics or transport), usually through aid agencies or the government of the affected country. Humanitarian aid is distinguished from [[humanitarian intervention]], which involves armed forces protecting civilians from violent oppression or [[genocide]] by state-supported actors.  . 

The [[Geneva Conventions]] give a mandate to the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|International Committee of the Red Cross]] and other impartial humanitarian organizations to provide assistance and protection of civilians during times of war.  The ICRC, has been given a special role by the [[Geneva Conventions]] with respect to the visiting and monitoring of prisoners of war.  . 

The United Nations [[Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] (OCHA) is mandated to coordinate the international humanitarian response to a natural disaster or complex emergency acting on the basis of the [http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=A/RES/46/182 United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/182].  . 

[http://www.sphereproject.org/ The Sphere Project] handbook, ''Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response,'' which was produced by a coalition of leading non-governmental humanitarian agencies, lists the following principles of humanitarian action:
# The right to live with dignity. 
# The distinction between combatant and non-combatants. 
# The principle of [[non-refoulement]].  . 

===Development aid===. 
[[File:ODA percent of GNI 2009.png|thumb|320px|Official Development Assistance (ODA) measured in [[Gross national income|GNI]] in 2009. Source: OECD]]
{{main|Development aid}}
Development aid is aid given by [[developed countries]] to support development in general which can be [[economic development]] or social development in [[developing countries]]. It is distinguished from [[humanitarian aid]] as being aimed at alleviating poverty in the long term, rather than alleviating suffering in the short term.  . 

[[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA), mentioned above, is a commonly used measure of developmental aid. Development aid is given by governments through individual countries' [[international aid agencies]] and through [[multilateral]] institutions such as the [[World Bank]], and by individuals through [[:Category:Development charities|development charities]] such as [[ActionAid]], [[Caritas internationalis|Caritas]], [[CARE (relief agency)|Care International]] or [[Oxfam]].  . 

The offer to give development aid has to be understood in the context of the [[Cold War]]. The speech in which [[Harry Truman]] announced the foundation of [[NATO]] is also a fundamental document of development policy:
<blockquote>In addition, we will provide military advice and equipment to free nations which will cooperate with us in the maintenance of peace and security. Fourth, we must embark on a bold new program for making the benefits of our scientific advances and industrial progress available for the improvement and growth of underdeveloped areas. More than half the people of the world are living in conditions approaching misery. Their food is inadequate. They are victims of disease. Their economic life is primitive and stagnant. Their poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous areas. For the first time in history, humanity possesses the knowledge and skill to relieve the suffering of these people. </blockquote> . 

==Sources==. 
Aid from various sources can reach recipients through bilateral or multilateral delivery systems. ''Bilateral'' refers to government to government transfers. ''Multilateral'' institutions, such as the World Bank or [[UNICEF]], pool aid from one or more sources and disperse it many recipients.  . 

===Official Development Assistance (ODA)===. 
{{Main|Official development assistance}}
ODA refers to aid from national governments for humanitarian purposes and for promoting economic development and welfare in low and middle income countries. ODA can be bilateral or multilateral. This aid is given as either [[grant (money)|grant]]s, where no repayment is required, or concessional [[loan]]s, where interest rates are lower than market rates. Loan repayments to multilateral institutions are pooled and redistributed as new loans. Additionally, debt relief, partial or total cancellation of loan repayments, is often added to total aid numbers even though it is not an actual transfer of funds. The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]'s [[Development Assistance Committee]] puts foreign aid into three categories: . 

*[[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA): Development aid provided to [[developing countries]] (on the "Part I" list) with the clear aim of [[economic development]]
*''Official Aid'' (OD): Development aid provided to developed countries (on the "Part II" list) and [[international organizations]]
*''Other Official Flows'' (OOF): Aid which does not fall into the other two categories, either because it is not aimed at development, or it consists of more than 75% loan (rather than grant).  . 

Aid is often ''pledged'' at one point in time, but ''disbursements'' (financial transfers) might not arrive until later.  . 

===Private giving===. 
Private giving includes aid from charities, philanthropic organizations or businesses to recipient countries or programs within recipient counties.  . 

===What is excluded===. 
Most monetary flows between nations are not counted as aid. These include market based flows such as [[foreign direct investment]]s and [[portfolio investment]]s. [[Remittance]]s from migrant workers to their home countries are not counted in aid numbers even though, by volume, it is twice as large as what is counted as aid. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/research/articlesBySubject/displaystory.cfm?subjectid=894664&story_id=14586906|title=Migration and development: The aid workers who really help|publisher=economist.com|accessdate=2012-01-16|date=2009-10-08}}</ref> Additionally, military support is not counted.  . 

== Receiving aid==. 
===Types===. 
*Project aid: Aid is given for a specific purpose e.g. building materials for a new school. 
*Programme aid: Aid is given for a specific sector e.g. funding of the education sector of a country. 
*[[Budget support]]: A form of Programme Aid that is directly channelled into the financial system of the recipient country. 
*Sector-wide Approaches (SWAPs): A combination of Project aid and Programme aid/Budget Support e.g.  support for the education sector in a country will include both funding of education projects (like school buildings) and provide funds to maintain them (like school books). 
*[[Technical assistance]]: Educated personnel, such as doctors are moved into developing countries to assist with a program of development. Can be both programme and project aid. 
*Food aid: Food is given to countries in urgent need of food supplies, especially if they have just experienced a natural disaster. Food aid can be provided by importing food from the donor, buying food locally, or providing cash. 
*[[International research]], such as research that went into the [[green revolution]] and many [[vaccine]]s.  . 

===Aid conditionality===. 
{{Main|Conditionality}}
{{Seealso|Tied aid}}
A major proportion of aid from donor nations is [[tied aid|tied]], mandating that a receiving nation spend on products and expertise originating only from the donor country. 
<ref name=tiedaid>{{cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=24509|title=Tied aid strangling nations, says UN|publisher=ispnews.net|accessdate=2011-05-27}}</ref> For example, [[Eritrea]] is forced to spend aid money on foreign [[goods and services]] to build a network of [[railway]]s even though it is cheaper to use local expertise and resources. <ref name=tiedaid/> [[United States|US]] law requires [[food aid]] be spent on buying food at home, instead of where the hungry live, and, as a result, half of what is spent is used on [[transport]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/160075|title=Let them eat micronutrients|publisher=newsweek.com|accessdate=2011-05-27}}</ref> . 

The [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]], as primary holders of developing countries' debt, attach [[structural adjustment]] [[Conditionality|conditionalities]] to loans which generally include the elimination of state subsidies and  the [[privatization]] of [[state services]]. For example, the [[World Bank]] presses poor nations to eliminate subsidies for [[fertilizer]] even while many farmers cannot afford them at market prices. <ref name=Malawi>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/world/africa/02malawi.html|title=Ending famine simply by ignoring the experts|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2011-05-27|first=Celia W.|last=Dugger|date=2007-12-02}}</ref> In the case of [[Malawi]], almost five million of its 13 million people used to need emergency food aid. However, after the government changed policy and subsidies for fertilizer and seed were introduced, farmers produced record-breaking corn harvests in 2006 and 2007 as production leaped to 3.4 million in 2007 from 1.2 million in 2005, making Malawi a major food exporter. <ref name=Malawi/> In the former [[Soviet]] states, the reconfiguration of public financing in their [[transition economy|transition to a market economy]] called for reduced spending on health and education, sharply increasing poverty. <ref name=Soviet>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E0D8163FF931A25753C1A9669C8B63|title=Study Finds Poverty Deepening in Former Communist Countries|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2011-05-28|date=2000-10-12}}</ref><ref>''Transition: The First Ten Years – Analysis and Lessons for Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union'', The World Bank, Washington, DC, 2002, p. 4. </ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/966616.stm|title=Child poverty soars in eastern Europe|publisher=BBC News|date=2000-10-11|accessdate=2011-05-27}}</ref> . 

== Criticism of aid ==. 
Aid is seldom given from motives of pure [[altruism]]; for instance it is often given as a means of supporting an ally in [[international politics]]. It may also be given with the intention of influencing the political process in the receiving nation. Whether one considers such aid helpful may depend on whether one agrees with the agenda being pursued by the donor nation in a particular case. During the conflict between [[communism]] and [[capitalism]] in the twentieth century, the champions of those ideologies, the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], each used aid to influence the internal politics of other nations, and to support their weaker allies. Perhaps the most notable example was the [[Marshall Plan]] by which the [[United States]], largely successfully, sought to pull [[Europe]]an nations toward capitalism and away from communism. Aid to underdeveloped countries has sometimes been criticized as being more in the interest of the donor than the recipient, or even a form of [[neocolonialism]]. <ref>S.K.B. Asante, "International Assistance and International Capitalism: Supportive or Counterproductive?", in Gwendolyn Carter and Patrick O'Meara (eds) ''African Independence: The First Twenty-Five Years'', 1985; Bloomington, Indiana, USA; Indiana University Press. p. 249. </ref>
[[File:Marshallplanhilfe.gif|thumb|190px|[[Marshall Plan]] aid to Germany, West Berlin, 1949]]
S.K.B'. Asante lists some specific motives a donor may have for giving aid: defense support, market expansion, foreign investment, missionary enterprise, cultural extension. <ref>Asante, p. 251. </ref>  In recent decades, aid by organizations such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] has been criticized as being primarily a tool used to open new areas up to global capitalists, and being only secondarily, if at all, concerned with the wellbeing of the people in the recipient countries.  . 

Besides criticism of motive, aid may be criticized simply on the grounds that it is not effective: i.e., it did not do what it was intended to do or help the people it was intended to help. This is essentially an ''economic'' criticism of aid. The two types of criticism are not entirely separate: critics of the ideology behind a piece of aid are likely to see it as ineffective; and indeed, ineffectiveness must imply some flaws in the ideology. Statistical studies have produced widely differing assessments of the correlation between aid and economic growth, and no firm consensus has emerged to suggest that foreign aid generally does boost growth. Some studies find a positive correlation, but others find either no correlation or a negative correlation. In the case of Africa, Asante (1985) gives the following assessment:  . 

<blockquote>Summing up the experience of African countries both at the national and at the regional levels it is no exaggeration to suggest that, on balance, foreign assistance, especially foreign capitalism, has been somewhat deleterious to African development. It must be admitted, however, that the pattern of development is complex and the effect upon it of foreign assistance is still not clearly determined. But the limited evidence available suggests that the forms in which foreign resources have been extended to Africa over the past twenty-five years, insofar as they are concerned with economic development, are, to a great extent, counterproductive. <ref>Asante, p. 265. </ref></blockquote> . 

The economist [[William Easterly]] and others have argued that aid can often distort incentives in poor countries in various harmful ways. Aid can also involve inflows of money to poor countries that have some similarities to inflows of money from natural resources that provoke the [[resource curse]]. <ref>Collier, Paul (2005). Is Aid Oil? An analysis of whether Africa can absorb more aid. Centre for the study of African Economies, Oxford University. </ref><ref>Djankov, Montalvo, Reynal-Querol (2005). [http://www.econ.upf.edu/docs/papers/downloads/870.pdf The curse of aid.] The World Bank. </ref> . 

Many individuals<ref name="Global Issues">[http://www.globalissues.org/article/35/foreign-aid-development-assistance], An article on Global Issues about the lack of adequate aid that also criticises U.S. Aid for the policy conditionalities that often accompany it</ref> and organizations criticize U.S. Aid. Emergency funds from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, for instance, are linked to a wide range of free-market policy prescriptions that some argue interfere in a country's sovereignty. Policy prescriptions from outsiders can do more harm as they might not fit the local environment. The IMF can be good at helping countries over a short problematic financial period, but for poor countries with long lasting issues it can cause harm.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} In his book ''The White Man's Burden'', Easterly argued that if the IMF only gave adjustment loans to countries that can repay it, instead of  forgiving debts or lending repetitively even if conditions are not met, it would maintain its credibility.  . 

In addition to the above criticisms, the logistics in which aid delivery occurs can be problematic. An earthquake in 2003 in [[Bam, Iran]] left tens of thousands of people in need of disaster zone aid. Although aid was flown in rapidly, regional belief systems, cultural backgrounds and even language seemed to have been omitted as a source of concern. Items such as religiously prohibited pork, and non-generic forms of medicine that lacked multilingual instructions came flooding in as relief. An implementation of aid can easily be problematic, causing more problems than it solves. <ref>Habibzadeh, Yadollahie, Kucheki (2008). [http://proxy.lib.sfu.ca/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=cmedm&AN=18675688&site=ehost-live  International aid in disaster zones: help or headache?] Lancet. </ref> . 

[[James Shikwati]], a [[Kenya]]n economist, has argued that foreign aid causes harm to the recipient nations, specifically because aid is distributed by local politicians, finances the creation of corrupt government such as that led by Dr Fredrick Chiluba in Zambia bureaucracies, and hollows out the local economy.  In an interview in Germany's ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' magazine, Shikwati uses the example of food aid delivered to Kenya in the form of a shipment of [[maize|corn]] from America. Portions of the corn may be diverted by corrupt politicians to their own tribes, or sold on the black market at prices that undercut local food producers. Similarly, Kenyan recipients of donated Western clothing will not buy clothing from local tailors, putting the tailors out of business. <ref>Thilo Thielke (interviewer), translated by Patrick Kessler. [http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,363663,00.html "For God's Sake, Please Stop the Aid!"]</ref>  In an episode of ''[[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]]'', [[John Stossel]] demonstrated the existence of secret government bank accounts which concealed foreign aid money destined for private purposes.  . 

Some believe that aid is offset by other economic programs such as [[agricultural subsidies]]. [[Mark Malloch Brown]], former head of the United Nations Development Program, estimated that farm subsidies cost poor countries about US$50 billion a year in lost agricultural exports: . 

<blockquote>
"It is the extraordinary distortion of global trade, where the West spends $360 billion a year on protecting its agriculture with a network of subsidies and tariffs that costs developing countries about US$50 billion in potential lost agricultural exports. Fifty billion dollars is the equivalent of today's level of development assistance."<ref>[http://content.undp.org/go/newsroom/2002/november/mmb-uganda.en;jsessionid=axbWzt8vXD9] Address by Mark Malloch Brown, UNDP Administrator, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda, 12 November 2002</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/05/opinion/05KRIS.html?ex=1027081396&ei=1&en=6415bc0232476bf2] "Farm Subsidies That Kill", July 5, 2002, By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, New York Times 
</ref> 
</blockquote> . 

Some have argued that the major international aid organizations have formed an aid [[cartel]]. <ref>[http://www.nyu.edu/fas/institute/dri/Easterly/File/Easterly_FP_article_2002.pdf] The cartel of good intentions, Foreign Policy, Washington, Jul/Aug 2002, Authors: William Easterly, Issue: 131, Pagination: 40-49, ISSN:  00157228</ref> . 

Another criticism is that financial flows from foreign aid can provoke effects that are similar to the [[resource curse]]. <ref>{{citation|url = http://www.econ.upf.edu/docs/papers/downloads/870.pdf|title = The curse of aid|last1 = Djankov|first1 = S|last2 = Montalvo|first2 = J G|last3 = Reynal-Querol|first3 = M|journal = Journal of Economic Growth|volume = 13|number = 3|pages = 169–94|year = 2008|publisher = Springer}}</ref> . 

In response to aid critics, a movement to reform U.S. foreign aid has started to gain momentum. In the United States, leaders of this movement include the [[Center for Global Development]], [[Oxfam America]], the [[Brookings Institution]], [[InterAction]], and [[Bread for the World]]. The various organizations have united to call for a new [[Foreign Assistance Act]], a national development strategy, and a new cabinet-level department for development. <ref>Loewenberg, Samuel (June 10, 2008) [http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0608/10968.html Coalition seeks cabinet-level foreign aid]. [[Politico.com]]. Retrieved Dec. 4, 2008. </ref> . 

===Beyond aid===. 
As a result of these numerous criticisms, other proposals for supporting developing economies and poverty stricken societies. Some analysts, such as researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]], argue that current support for the developing world suffers from a '''policy incoherence''' and that while some policies are designed to support the third world, other domestic policies undermine its impact,<ref name=ODI>Alan Hudson and Linnea Jonsson (2009) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=3288&title=beyond-aid-policy-coherence ‘Beyond Aid’ for sustainable development] London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> examples include:
* encouraging developing economies to develop their agriculture with a focus on exports is not effective on a global market where key players, such as the US and EU, heavily subsidise their products
* providing aid to developing economies' health sectors and the training of personnel is undermined by migration policies in developed countries that encourage the migration of skilled health professionals . 

One measure of this policy incoherence is the [[Commitment to Development Index|Commitment to Development Index (CDI)]] published by the [[Center for Global Development]] .  The index measures and evaluates 22 of the world's richest countries on policies that affect developing countries, in addition to simply aid.  It shows that development policy is more than just aid; it also takes into account trade, investment, migration, environment, security, and technology.   . 

Thus, some states are beginning to go ''Beyond Aid'' and instead seek to ensure there is a policy coherence, for example see [[Common Agricultural Policy]] reform or [[Doha Development Round]]. This approach might see the nature of aid change from loans, debt cancellation, budget support etc., to supporting developing countries. This requires a strong political will, however, the results could potentially make aid far more effective and efficient. <ref name=ODI/> . 

==Aid inefficiencies and possible improvements==. 
===Aid destinations===. 
It is true that aid is rarely given for motives of pure altruism.  However, it is important to look at where aid goes. For example, “only about one fifth of U.S. aid goes to countries classified by the OECD as ‘least developed.’”<ref name="Singer"/> This “pro-rich” trend is not unique to the United States. <ref name="Singer">Singer, Peter. 2009. The Life You Can Save. New York:Random House. </ref><ref name="Sachs">Sachs, Jeffrey D. 2005. The End of Poverty: Economic Possibilities for Our Time. New York: Penguin Books. </ref> According to Collier, “the middle income countries get aid because they are of much more commercial and political interest than the tiny markets and powerlessness of the bottom billion.”<ref name="Collier">Collier, Paul. 2007. The Bottom Billion: Why the Poorest Countries are Failing and What Can Be Done About It. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press. </ref> What this means is that, at the most basic level, aid is not targeting the most extreme poverty. <ref name="Singer"/><ref name="Sachs"/> . 

The form of aid must also be considered.  The [[World Bank]], until recently, issued only loans, meaning that the country must repay both the loan and the interest rates.  In contrast, the [[European Commission]] issues grants, which countries need not worry about paying back.  This means that “loans have been going to the poorest countries and the grants to the middle-income countries.”<ref name="Collier"/> . 

Furthermore, consider the breakdown, where aid goes and for what purposes.  In 2002, total gross foreign aid to all developing countries was $76 billion.  Dollars that do not contribute to a country’s ability to support basic needs interventions are subtracted.  Subtract $6 billion for debt relief grants. Subtract $11 billion, which is the amount developing countries paid to developed nations in that year in the form of loan repayments.  Next, subtract the aid given to middle income countries, $16 billion.  The remainder, $43 billion, is the amount that developing countries received in 2002.  But only $12 billion went to low-income countries ($15 billion for all developing countries) in a form that could be deemed budget support for basic needs. <ref name="Sachs"/> . 

When aid is given to the [[Least Developed Countries]] who have good governments and strategic plans for the aid, it is thought that it is more effective. <ref name="Sachs"/> . 

===Aid outcomes and implications===. 
The basic criticism of aid is that it neither goes where it was intended nor helps those intended.  According to Collier, there are four known traps that contribute this problem.  The first such trap is known as the conflict trap.  Aid should not be used to finance military endeavors.  It is difficult to “design aid in such a way that it works even in the environments of poor governance and poor policy that are most at risk of conflict.”<ref name="Collier"/>  The second trap is called the natural resource trap.  Countries that are resource rich already have a large volume of capital flowing into their economies.  However, it is not being used to its potential.  The third trap occurs when a country is entirely landlocked, making it difficult for the country to engage in global trade. <ref name="Collier"/> . 

The fourth trap is that of bad governance.  However, “there are three ways in which aid can potentially help turnarounds: incentives, skills, and reinforcement.”<ref name="Collier"/> Policy conditionalities, or [[structural adjustments]], were reservations put on aid until a government agreed to aid implemented in the 1980s.  This did not work.  Aid needs to somehow provide incentives for giving the people power.  Power needs to be transferred from the governments to the people. <ref name="Collier"/> Aid should be restructured in order to allow for skills building in country.  According to Collier, “technical assistance is not negligible – money spent on countries with the skilled people who constitute technical assistance is a quarter of total aid flows.”<ref name="Collier"/> The problem is not that too little money is being provided, rather that technical assistance is not country specific.  Aid is also given as budget support, reinforcement for failing states.  There is an opportune moment for assisting failing states but it must be done at the right time.  Aid cannot be continually poured into failing states and be expected to produce a turnaround.  However  if aid is given at the opportune political moment, it can support turnarounds.  Collier suggests that when that moment occurs “pour in the technical assistance as quickly as possible to help implement reform” and “then, after a few years, start pouring in the money for the government to spend.”<ref name="Collier"/> . 

===Actual impact===. 
Peter Singer argues that over the last three decades, “aid has added around one percentage point to the annual growth rate of the bottom billion.” He argues that this has made the difference between “stagnation and severe cumulative decline.”<ref name="Singer"/>  Aid can make progress towards reducing poverty worldwide, or at least help prevent cumulative decline.  . 

===Improving the economic efficiency of aid===. 
Currently, donor institutions make proposals for aid packages to recipient countries.  The recipient countries then make a plan for how to use the aid based on how much money has been given to them.  Alternatively, NGO's receive funding from private sources or the government, and then implement plans to end their specific issues. In the views of many scholars, this system is inherently ineffective. <ref name="Sachs"/>  If we hope to eliminate poverty, we must reexamine how we distribute funding, and how we attack problems.  . 

According to Sachs, we should redefine how we think of aid.  The first step should be to learn what developing countries hope to accomplish and how much money they need to accomplish those goals.  Goals should be made with the [[Millennium Development Goals]] in mind for these furnish real metrics for providing basic needs.  The “actual transfer of funds must be based on rigorous, country-specific plans that are developed through open and consultative processes, backed by good governance in the recipient countries, as well as careful planning and evaluation.”<ref name="Sachs"/> . 

Possibilities are also emerging as some developing countries are experiencing rapid economic growth, they are able to provide their own expertise gained from their recent transition. This knowledge transfer can be seen in donors, such as Brazil, whose $1 billion in aid outstrips that of many traditional donors. <ref name="ODI1">Cabral and Weinstock 2010.

===Various academic theories===. 
Since the 1960s, improving the efficiency of foreign aid has been a common topic of academic research. There is debate on whether foreign aid is efficacious, but for the purposes of this article we will ignore that. Given that schema, a common debate is over which factors influence the overall economic efficiency of foreign aid. Indeed, there is debate about whether aid impact should be measured empirically at all, but again, we will limit our scope to increasing the economic efficiency.  . 

===Philosophy===. 
At the forefront of the aid debate has been the conflict between professor [[William Easterly]] of New York University <ref>http://williameasterly.org</ref> and his ideological opposite, Jeffrey Sachs, from Columbia University. Easterly advocates the "searcher's" approach, while Sachs advocates a more top down, broad planned approach. We will discuss both of these at length. <ref>http://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/1770</ref> . 

===“Searchers Approach”===. 
William Easterly offers a nontraditional, and somewhat controversial “searching” approach to solving poverty, as opposed to the “planned” approach in his famous critique of the more traditional Owen/Sachs, The White Man’s Burden. Traditional poverty reduction, Easterly claims is based on the idea that we know what is best for those countries, which are impoverished. He claims that they know what’s best. Having a top down “master plan,” he claims, is inefficient. His alternative, called the “Searchers” approach, uses a bottom up strategy.  That is, this approach starts by surveying the poor in the countries in question, and then tries to directly aid individuals, rather than governments. Local markets are a key incentive structure. The primary example is of Mosquito nets in Malawi. In this example, an [[NGO]] sells Mosquito nets to rich Malawians, and uses the profits to subsidize cheap sales to the impoverished. Hospital nurses are used as middle-women, profiting a few cents on every net sold to a patient. This incentive structure has seen the usage of nets in Malawi spike over 40% in less than 7 years. <ref name="Easterly 2007">{{cite book

====Aspects of “Searcher’s Approach”====. 
=====Bottom up philosophy=====. 
One of the central tenets in Easterly’s approach is a more bottom up philosophy of aid. This applies not only to the identification of problems, but to the actual distribution of capital to the areas in need. In effect, Easterly would have countries go to the area which needed aid, collect information about the problem, find out what the population wanted, and then work from there. In keeping with this, funds would also be distributed from the bottom up, rather than being given to a specific government. <ref name="Easterly 2007"/> . 

=====Utilize aid organizations, and local frameworks=====. 
Easterly also advocates working through currently existing 
Aid organizations, and letting them compete for funding. Utilizing preexisting national organizations and local frameworks would not only help give target populations a voice in implementation and goal setting, but is more efficient economically. Easterly argues that the preexisting frameworks already "know" what the problems are, as opposed to outside [[NGO]]s who tend to "guess". 
<ref name="Easterly 2007"/> . 

=====Aid individuals, not governments=====. 
Easterly strongly discourages aid to government as a rule. He believes,
for several reasons, that aid to small “bottom up” organizations and 
Individual groups is a better philosophy than to large governments. <ref name="Easterly 2007"/> . 

=====Independent evaluation=====. 
Easterly states that for far too long, inefficient aid organizations have been funded, and that this is a problem. The current system of evaluation for most aid 
organizations is internal. Easterly claims that the process is biased because organizations have a large incentive to represent their progress in a positive light. What he proposes as an alternative is an independent auditing system for aid organizations. Before receiving funding, the organization would state their goals and how they expect to measure and achieve them. If they do not meet their goals, Easterly proposes we shift our funding to organizations who are successful. This would prompt organizations to either become efficient, or obsolete. <ref name="Easterly 2007"/> . 

=====Compartmentalized goals=====. 
Easterly believes that aid goals should be small. In his opinion, one of the main failings of aid lies in the fact that we create large, utopian lists of things we hope to accomplish, without the means to actually see them to fruition. Rather than establish a utopian vision for a particular country, Easterly insists that we shift our focus to the most basic needs and improvements.If we feed, clothe, vaccinate, build infrastructure, and support markets, the macroscopic results will follow. <ref name="Easterly 2007"/> . 

=====Use the market=====. 
 The “Searching Approach” is intrinsically tied to the market. Easterly 
 claims that the only way for poverty to truly end is for the poor to be 
 given the capability to lift themselves out of poverty, and then for it to
 happen. Philosophically, this sounds like the traditional [[bootstrapping|“bootstrap” 
 theory]], but it isn’t. What he says is that the poor should be given the
 fiscal support to create their market, which would give them the ability to
 become self reliant in the future. <ref name="Easterly 2007"/> . 

======Ideas======. 
 In the end of his book, Easterly proposes a voucher system for foreign
 aid. The poor would be distributed a certain amount of vouchers, 
 which would act as currency, redeemable to aid organizations for 
 services, medicines, and the like. These vouchers would then be 
 redeemed by the aid organizations for more funding. In this way,
 the aid organization would be forced to compete, if by proxy. <ref name="Easterly 2007"/> . 

===Proscriptive "Ladder Approach" ===. 
 Sachs presents a near dichotomy to Easterly. Sachs presents a broad, 
 proscriptive solution to poverty. In his book, The End of Poverty, he explains
 how throughout history, countries have ascended from poverty by following  
 a relatively simple model. First, you promote agricultural development, then
 industrialize, embrace technology, and finally become modern. This is
 the standard “western” model of development that has been followed by 
 countries such as China and India. Sachs main idea is that there should have a 
 broad analytical “checklist” of things a country must attain before it can 
 reach the next step on the ladder to development. Western nations should 
 donate a percentage of their GDP as determined by the UN, and pump money 
 into helping impoverished countries climb the ladder. Sachs insists that if followed, his strategy would eliminate poverty by 2025.  .

}}</ref> . 

====Top down====. 
 Sachs advocates using a top down methodology, utilizing broad ranging plans 
 developed by external aid organizations like the UN and World Bank. To Sachs, these plans are essential to a coherent and timely eradication of poverty.He surmises that if donor and recipient countries follow the plan, they will be able to climb out of poverty.  . 

<ref name="Sachs 2005"/> . 

====Use external framework====. 
 Part of Sachs’ philosophy includes strengthening the International Monetary
 Fund, World Bank, and the United Nations. If those institutions are given the 
 power to enact change, and freed from mitigating influences, then they will
 be much more effective. Sachs does not find fault in the international organizations themselves. Instead, he blames the member nations who compose them. The powerful nations of  the world must make a commitment to end poverty, then stick to it.  . 

<ref name="Sachs 2005"/> . 

====Aid through existing governments====. 
 Sachs believes it is best to empower countries by utilizing their existing governments, rather than trying to circumnavigate them. He remarks that while the 
 corruption argument is logically valid in that corruption harms the efficiency of aid, levels of corruption tend to be much higher on average for countries with low levels of GDP. He contends that this hurdle in government should not disqualify entire populations for much needed aid from the west.  . 

<ref name="Sachs 2005"/> . 

====Self evaluation====. 
 Sachs does not see the need for independent evaluators, and sees them as a 
 detractor to proper progress. He argues that many facets of aid cannot be 
 effectively quantified, and thus it is not fair to try to put empirical 
 benchmarks on the effectiveness of aid. <ref name="Sachs 2005"/> . 

====Optimism====. 
 Sachs’ view makes it a point to attack and attempt to disprove many of the 
 ideas that the more “pessimistic” Easterly stands on.  . 

 First, he points to economic freedom. One of the common threads of logic 
 In aid is that countries need to develop economically in order to rise from 
 Poverty. On this, there is not a ton of debate. However, Sachs contends that 
 Easterly, and many other neo-Liberal economists believe high levels of 
 Economic freedom in these emerging markets is almost a necessity to 
 Development. Sachs himself does not believe this. He cites the lack of 
 Correlation between the average degrees of Economic Freedom in countries 
 And their yearly GDP growth, which in his data set is completely 
 Inconclusive.  . 

 Also, Sachs contends that democratization is not an integral part of having 
 Efficient aid distribution. Rather than attach strings to our aid dollars, or only
 Working with democracies or “good governments”, Sachs believes we should 
 Consider the type of government in the needy country as a secondary 
 Concern.  . 

 Sachs’ entire approach stands on the assertion that abject poverty could be 
 Ended worldwide by 2025. <ref name="Sachs 2005"/> . 

===Economic efficiency===. 
====David Dollar====. 
Dollar/Collier showed that current allocations of aid are allocated inefficiently. They came to the conclusion that aid money is given in many cases as an incentive to change policy, and for political reasons, which in many cases can be less efficient than the optimal condition. They agree that bad policy is detrimental to economic growth, which is a key component of poverty reduction, but have found that aid dollars do not significantly incentivize governments to change policy. In fact, they have negligible impact. As an alternative, Dollar proposes that aid be funneled more towards countries with “good” policy and less than optimal amounts of aid for their massive amounts of poverty. With respect to “optimal amounts” Dollar calculated the marginal productivity of each additional dollar of foreign aid for the countries sampled, and saw that some countries had very high rates of marginal productivity (each dollar went further), while others [with particularly high amounts of aid, and lower levels of poverty] had low [and sometimes negative] levels of [[marginal productivity]]. In terms of economic efficiency, aid funding would be best allocated towards countries whose marginal productivities per dollar were highest, and away from those countries who had low to negative marginal productivities.  The conclusion was that while an estimated 10 million people are lifted from poverty with current aid policies, that number could be increased to 19 million with efficient aid allocation. <ref>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292101001878</ref> . 

====Dalgaard====. 
In a followup study to Collier, Dalgaard finds that regardless of policies and utility, aid seems to be less efficient per dollar in the tropics. He states that aid dollars are likely to be just as effective anywhere, so there must be a mitigating externality that is not being accounted for. <ref>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0297.2004.00219.x/full</ref> . 

====“New Conditionality”====. 
New Conditionality is the term used in a paper to describe somewhat of a compromise between Dollar and Hansen. Paul Mosely describes how policy is important,  and that aid distribution is improper. However, unlike Dollar, “New Conditionality” claims that the most important factors in efficiency of aid are income distributions in the recipient country and corruption. <ref>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0297.2004.00220.x/full</ref> . 

====McGillivray====. 
One of the problems in foreign aid allocation is the marginalization of the fragile state. The fragile state, with its high volatility, and risk of failure scares away donors. The people of those states feel harm and are marginalized as a result. Additionally, the fate of neighboring states is important, as economies of the directly adjacent states to those impoverished, volatile “fragile states” can be negatively impacted by as much as 1.6% of their GDP per year. This is no small figure.  McGillivray advocates for the reduced volatility of aid flows, which can only be attained through analysis and coordination. <ref>http://www.ineesite.org/uploads/documents/store/doc_1_Aid_Allocation_and_FS.pdf</ref> . 

====Beynon====. 
Beynon revisits Collier/Dollar’s “efficient aid allocation” and finds much of the same results, although he believes that the model needs to be more robust, with more samplings, and take into account other Millennium Development Goals. <ref>http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/download/1861.pdf</ref> . 

===Aid conditionality=== . 

Aid often comes with conditions on its allocation. This is called Aid Conditionality. The two types of conditionality are Outcome and Process based conditionality. Outcome conditionality ties aid to a certain goal, while process conditionality ties aid to a certain method of implementation. These two forms of conditionality are often seen together. The problem with aid conditionality is that it not only restricts the local legislatures in how they shape their own country, but often removes local populations from the goal setting and decision making process entirely. <ref>http://www.unrisd.org/80256B3C005BCCF9/(httpAuxPages)/D636C818D6CA3D97C12577890035C09B?OpenDocument</ref> . 

Academic research has shown that in many instances, aid is conditionally tied due to political motives, rather than notions of proper policy and implementation.  . 

====Economic motive as a condition for aid====. 
Economic objectives have overshadowed foreign aid assistance since the 1970s. Anup Asha in her article,[http://www.globalissues.org/article/35/ Aid for Development Assistance], noted that donor countries condition their recipients to only purchase their products or hire their expertise to qualify for aid. She further argues that while the European Union and the US strongly advocate for trade liberalization when awarding development aid assistance to developing countries, they heavily subsidizes their agricultural sectors by about $ 35-40 billion and $190 per year respectively. As a result of these disguised policies it was discovered that developing countries in 2002 alone made a transfer of about $200 billion to donor countries. This shift in development aid assistance and of course a cause of its inherent failure has drawn lots of criticism especially from the UN. In his 2003 a dress to [http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0310/S00333.htm the UN assembly] , Kofi Anan  sheds more light to the situation saying; "even taking all subtlety and nuance into account," developing countries made the sixth consecutive and largest ever transfer of funds to "other countries" in 2002, a sum totalling "almost $200 billion." “Funds should be moving from developed countries to developing countries, but these numbers tell us the opposite is happening…. Funds that should be promoting investment and growth in developing countries, or building schools and hospitals, or supporting other steps towards the Millennium Development Goals, are, instead, being transferred abroad.” . 

A notable example of this is US aid to fund HIV/AIDS treatment in Africa. According to Thalif Deen's [http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=24509] Tied Aid Strangling Nations,Washington conditioned African governments to purchase anti- HIV/AIDS drugs only from American companies which costs $15,000 annually to a patient who lives below a $1.00 a day compared to purchasing South African made generic drugs that would cost $350 annually. This ultimately makes the poor country worse off. 
An empirical evidence that illustrates this point is shown by the Reality of Aid 2000 publication (Earthscan publication 2000,p.&nbsp;81) in their section of US Aid that "71.6% of US bilateral aid commitments were tied to the purchase of goods and services from the Us".This conditionality completely ignores the objective of aid to finance development because the prescribed purchase of goods and services from the US will be  more expensive than the locally available alternatives.This strategy in effect ensures that the US gets back its money into its economy.  . 

The European Union double standard of trade policy mentioned above is more illustrated in its trade with Latin America. In their April 2002 publication,[http://www.oxfam.org.uk/what_we_do/issues/trade/bp22_eutrade.htm Oxfarm Report] reveals that aid tied to trade Liberalization by the donor countries such as the EU with the aim of achieving economic objective is becoming detrimental to developing countries.For example, the EU subsidizes its agricultural sectors in the expense of Latin America who must liberalize trade in order to qualify for aid. Latin America having, a comparative advantage on agriculture and mainly forms its export sector losts $ 4bn annually due to the EU farm subsidy policies. The aid money actually, instead of being used to finance other development infrastructure, ends up being used to fund terms of trade deficit brought about by trade liberalization. This inequalities and many others imposed upon developing countries have actually benefited the donor rather than the recipient.This cases clearly illustrate the evolution of development aid assistance from providing financial resource to fuel development to being a foreign policy tool used by donor countries to promote their domestic interests. while this can be considered controversial issues, addressing them  adequately may help attain some effectiveness in development aid assistance goals.  . 

====Aid and UNSC votes====. 
Axel Dreher showed that over the period 1951-2004, there was a robust positive relationship between United Nations Security Council membership and participation in Internation Monetary Fund programs.  Additionally, conditions placed on Security Council member nations' aid are lower in number and severity. 
<ref>http://wwz.unibas.ch/fileadmin/wwz/redaktion/dekanat/Forschungsseminar_HS09/Sturm_EER09.pdf</ref>
Member nations of the UNSC received on average .8 more World Bank loans per year. 
<ref>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1011972</ref> . 

====Aid conditionality and good governance====. 
Seemingly in support of Bill Easterly's searcher's approach, Carlos Santiso found evidence that conditionality is quite harmful to development, and advocates a "radical approach in which donors cede control to the recipient country".  . 

Santiso also argues that neither good governance or democracy is sustainable without the other.
