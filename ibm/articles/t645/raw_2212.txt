Currently total social welfare expenditure constitutes roughly 35% of [[GDP]], with purely public expenditure constituting 21%, publicly supported but privately provided welfare services constituting 10% of GDP and purely private services constituting 4% of GDP.  This compares to France and Sweden whose welfare spending ranges from 30% to 35% of GDP. <ref name="Alber">Alber, J. (1988). Is There a Crisis of the Welfare State?

== Analysis ==. 
Although the United States has higher income inequality than many European countries, its welfare programs do not engage in as much income redistribution. In 1998, the United States government's expenditures on subsidies and transfers constituted 11 percent of its GDP, whereas the average government expenditures on subsidies and transfers constituted 19% GDP in countries in the European Union(Alesina, Glaeser, Sacerdote (2000)). Many scholars believe that this is because the United States has a lower level of "reciprocal altruism," and that this is in part a result of its ethnic heterogeneity.  A history of perceived high income mobility has promoted a normative belief in American culture that the individual who works hard and perseveres will experience a rise in income, and consequently, economic inequality is often viewed as the just cumulative result of varying degrees of personal responsibility <ref name="McNamee"> Stephen J. McNamee & Robert K. Miller (2009) The Meritocracy Myth. Rowman & Littlefield Publishers</ref>.  Some recent studies, however, have shown that income mobility in the U.S. is lower than in Europe today.  Asian countries such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore have low taxes including a flat income tax; they have low social spending of which very little is categorized as redistribution; all the while income equality is acceptable and income mobility is high.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} . 

The American welfare state was designed to address market shortcomings and do what private enterprises cannot or will not do themselves. Unlike welfare states built on [[social democracy]] foundations it was not designed to promote a redistribution of political power from capital to labor; nor was it designed to mediate class struggle. <ref name="Esping-Andersen"/> Income redistribution, through programs such as the EITC, has been defended on the grounds that the market cannot provide goods and services universally{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, while interventions going beyond transfers are justified by the presence of [[imperfect information]], [[imperfect competition]], [[incomplete markets]], [[externalities]], and the presence of [[public good]]s. The welfare state, whether through charitable redistribution or regulation that favors smaller players, is motivated by reciprocal altruism. <ref name="Barr"/> . 

The U.S. government generally refrains from intervention beyond the provision of transfers if markets can produce a given good or service efficiently.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} There does, however, remain considerable debate on whether the U.S. government is intervening sufficiently to address market shortcomings. Some argue that an expansion of the welfare state is desirable because the market cannot or will not satisfactorily ameliorate unjust economic and social inequality.  Others argue that the welfare state has grown too large, and a more laissez-faire form of capitalism is desirable. <ref name="Behravesh">Behravesh, N. (2008).

==Social insurance==. 
{{main|Social Security (United States)}} . 

The [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] program mainly refers to the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program, and possibly the unemployment insurance program.  . 

[[Retirement Insurance Benefits]] (RIB), also known as Old-age Insurance Benefits, are a form of social insurance payments made by the U.S. Social Security Administration paid based upon the attainment old age (62 or older).  . 

[[Social Security Disability Insurance]] (SSD or SSDI) is a federal insurance program that provides [[income supplement]]s to people who are physically restricted in their ability to be [[employed]] because of a notable [[disability]], usually a [[physical disability]].  . 

[[Unemployment benefits#United States|Unemployment insurance]], also known as unemployment compensation, provides for money from the United States and the state by a worker who has become unemployed through no fault of their own.  .

{{main|Supplemental Security Income|Temporary Assistance for Needy Families}} . 

The [[Supplemental Security Income]] (SSI) program provides stipends to low-income people who are either aged (65 or older), blind, or disabled.  . 

The [[Temporary Assistance for Needy Families]] (TANF) provides cash assistance to indigent American families with dependent children.  . 

==Healthcare==. 
{{main|Health care in the United States|Medicare (United States)|Medicaid}} . 

[[Health care in the United States]] is provided by many separate legal entities. [[Health care]] facilities are largely owned and operated by the [[private sector]]. [[Health insurance in the United States]] is now primarily provided by the government in the public sector, with 60-65% of healthcare provision and spending coming from programs such as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]], [[TRICARE]], the [[Children's Health Insurance Program]], and the [[Veterans Health Administration]].  . 

[[Medicare]] is a [[social insurance]] program administered by the [[United States government]], providing [[health insurance]] coverage to people who are aged 65 and over; to those who are under 65 and are permanently physically disabled or who have a congenital physical disability; or to those who meet other special criteria like the [[End Stage Renal Disease (US Federal Program)|End Stage Reneal Disease]] program (ESRD). Medicare in the United States somewhat resembles a [[single-payer health care]] system but is not. Before Medicare, only 51% of people aged 65 and older had health care coverage, and nearly 30% lived below the federal poverty level.  . 

[[Medicaid]] is a health program for certain people and families with low incomes and resources. It is a [[means test|means-test]]ed program that is jointly funded by the state and federal governments, and is managed by the states. <ref>[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidGenInfo/ Medicaid General Information] from the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] . (CMS) website</ref>  People served by Medicaid are [[Citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizens]] or legal permanent residents, including low-income adults, their children, and people with certain [[Disability|disabilities]]. Poverty alone does not necessarily qualify someone for Medicaid. Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health-related services for people with limited income in the United States.  . 

The [[Children's Health Insurance Program]] (CHIP) is a program administered by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] that provides [[matching funds]] to states for [[health insurance]] to families with children. <ref>Sultz, H., & Young, K. Health Care USA Understanding its Organization and Delivery pg. 257</ref> The program was designed to cover uninsured children in families with incomes that are modest but too high to qualify for Medicaid.  . 

==Education==. 
{{main|Education in the United States}}
[[File:UCBerkeleyCampus.jpg|thumb|[[University of California, Berkeley]] is one of the oldest public universities in the U.S.]] . 

Per capita spending on tertiary education is among the highest in the world{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. Public education is managed by individual states, municipalities and regional school districts. As in all developed countries, [[Primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]] is free, universal and mandatory. Parents do have the option of [[home-schooling]] their children, though some states, such as [[California]] (until a 2008 legal ruling overturned this requirement), require parents to obtain teaching credentials before doing so. Experimental programs give lower-income parents the option of using government issued vouchers to send their kids to private rather than public schools in some states/regions.  . 

As of 2007, more than 80% of all primary and secondary students were enrolled in public schools, including 75% of those from households with [[Income in the United States|incomes]] in the [[Affluence in the United States|top 5%]]. Public schools commonly offer after-school programs and the government subsidizes private after school programs, such as the [[Boys & Girls Clubs of America|Boys & Girls Club]]. While pre-school education is subsidized as well, through programs such as [[Head Start program|Head Start]], many Americans still find themselves unable to take advantage of them. Some education critics have therefore proposed creating a comprehensive transfer system to make pre-school education universal, pointing out that the financial returns alone would compensate for the cost.  . 

Tertiary education is not free, but is subsidized by individual states and the federal government. Students may attend public institutions or private institutions. Some of the costs at public institutions is carried by the state.  . 

The government also provides grants, scholarships and subsidized loans to most students. Those who do not qualify for any type of aid, can obtain a government guaranteed loan and tuition can often be deducted from the [[Income tax in the United States|federal income tax]]. Despite subsidized attendance cost at public institutions and tax deductions, however, tuition costs have risen at three times the rate of [[median household income]] since 1982. <ref name="NYT">{{cite news|url=http://community.nytimes.com/article/comments/2008/12/03/education/03college.html?permid=51|title=NYT on increase in tuition|accessdate=2009-01-15 | work=The New York Times | first=Tamar | last=Lewin}}</ref> In fear that many future Americans might be excluded from tertiary education, progressive Democrats have proposed increasing financial aid and subsidizing an increased share of attendance costs. Some Democratic politicians and political groups have also proposed to make public tertiary education free of charge, i.e. subsidizing 100% of attendance cost.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} . 

==Food assistance==. 
{{main|Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|WIC|l2=Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children}} . 

In the U.S., financial assistance for food purchasing for [[Poverty|low- and no-income]] people is provided through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as the Food Stamp Program. <ref>[http://www.fns.usda.gov/fns/ "Nutrition Assistance Program Home Page"], U.S. [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] (official website), March 3, 2011 (last revised). Accessed March 4, 2011. </ref> This is a [[Administration of federal assistance in the United States|federal aid]] program is administered by the [[Food and Nutrition Service]] of the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]], but benefits are distributed by the individual [[U.S. state]]s. It is historically and commonly known as the Food Stamp Program. To be eligible for food stamps, the recipients must have incomes below 130 percent of the poverty line, and also own few assets. <ref name=Eckholm>{{cite news |title=Food stamp use in U.S. at record pace as jobs vanish |author=Erik Eckholm |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/31/world/americas/31iht-31foodstamps.11544038.html |work=The New York Times |date=March 31, 2008 |accessdate=January 30, 2012}}</ref> Since the economic downturn began in 2008, the use of food stamps has increased. <ref name=Eckholm/> As of 2011, the U.S. government spends approximately $111 billion per year on federal and state food programs and over 46 million people received food stamps. <ref name=Zozak>{{cite news |title=The Myth of Starving Americans |author=Warren Zozak |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204573704577185553258224344.html?mod=googlenews_wsj |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=January 30, 2012 |accessdate=January 30, 2012}}</ref> . 

Conservative commentators have argued that there is fraudulent use of the food stamp program, including selling food stamps for money and individuals applying more than once for assistance, leading to a greater burden for taxpayers. <ref name=Zozak/> According to The Heritage Foundation, $2.5 billion is spent on improper use of food stamps. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.heritage.org/2011/12/09/food-stamp-fraud-costing-taxpayers-billions/ |title=Food Stamp Fraud Costing Tax Payers Billions |author=Rachel Sheffield |date=December 9, 2011 |work=The Foundry |publisher=The Heritage Foundation |accessdate=January 30, 2012}}</ref> Reforms of the program have been suggested, including the requirement that able-bodied, non-elderly applicants for food stamps demonstrate that they are working or looking for work. <ref name=Zozak/> . 

The [[WIC|Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children]] (WIC) is a [[child nutrition programs|child nutrition program]] for healthcare and nutrition of low-income pregnant women, breastfeeding women, and infants and children under the age of five. The eligibility requirement is a family income  below 185% of the [[Poverty_in_the_United_States#Recent_poverty_rate_and_guidelines|U.S. Poverty Income Guidelines]], but if a person participates in other benefit programs, or has family members who participate in the Food Stamp Program, Medicaid, or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, they automatically meet the eligibility requirements.  . 

==Housing==. 
{{main|Public housing in the United States|Section 8 (housing)}} . 

The [[Housing and Community Development Act of 1974]] created [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8 housing]], the payment of [[renting|rent]] assistance to private landlords on behalf of low-income households.  .
