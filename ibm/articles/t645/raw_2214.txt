'''Poverty'''  is the state of one who lacks a certain amount of material possessions or money. <ref name=britannica>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/473136/poverty|title=Poverty (sociology)|publisher=britannica.com|accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref> [[Poverty threshold|Absolute poverty]] or '''destitution''' refers to the one who lacks [[basic needs|basic human needs]], which commonly includes [[drinking water|clean and fresh water]], [[nutrition]], [[health care]], [[education]], clothing and shelter. About 1.7 billion people are estimated to live in absolute poverty today. [[Relative poverty]] refers to lacking a usual or socially acceptable level of resources or income as compared with others within a society or country. <ref name=britannica/>
For most of history poverty had been mostly accepted as inevitable as traditional modes of production were insufficient to give an entire population a comfortable [[standard of living]]. <ref name=britannica/><ref name="macroeconomics1">Krugman, Paul, and Robin Wells. Macroeconomics. 2. New York City: Worth Publishers, 2009.

The supply of basic needs can be restricted by constraints on government services such as [[political corruption|corruption]], [[Developing countries' debt|debt]] and [[Conditionality|loan conditionalities]] and by the [[brain drain]] of health care and educational professionals. Strategies of increasing income to make basic needs more affordable typically include [[welfare]], [[economic freedom]], and providing [[financial services]]. Today, [[poverty#Poverty reduction|poverty reduction]] is a major goal and issue for many international organizations such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[World Bank]].  . 

==Etymology==. 
The [[English language|English]] word "poverty" came from [[Latin]] ''pauper'' = "poor", via [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] povert. There are several definitions of poverty depending on the context of the situation in is placed in and the views of the person giving the definition.  .

===Definitions===. 
[[United Nations]]: Fundamentally, poverty is a denial of choices and opportunities, a violation of human dignity. It means lack of basic capacity to participate effectively in society. It means not having enough to feed and clothe a family, not having a school or clinic to go to, not having the land on which to grow one’s food or a job to earn one’s living, not having access to credit. It means insecurity, powerlessness and exclusion of individuals, households and communities. It means susceptibility to violence, and it often implies living in marginal or fragile environments, without access to clean water or sanitation. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unyin/documents/ydiDavidGordon_poverty.pdf|title=Indicators of Poverty & Hunger|publisher=un.org|accessdate=2011-05-27}}</ref> . 

[[World Bank]]: Poverty is pronounced deprivation in well-being, and comprises many dimensions. It includes low incomes and the inability to acquire the basic goods and services necessary for survival with dignity. Poverty also encompasses low levels of health and education, poor access to clean water and sanitation, inadequate physical security, lack of voice, and insufficient capacity and opportunity to better one’s life.

===Absolute poverty===. 
Poverty is usually measured as either [[absolute poverty|absolute]] or [[relative poverty]] (the latter being actually an index of income inequality). Absolute poverty refers to a set standard which is consistent over time and between countries. The [[World Bank Group|World Bank]] defines [[extreme poverty]] as living on less than US $1.25 ([[Purchasing power parity|PPP]]) per day, and ''moderate poverty'' as less than $2 or $5 a day (but note that a person or family with access to subsistence resources, e.g. [[subsistence farmers]], may have a low cash income without a correspondingly low standard of living – they are not living "on" their cash income but using it as a top up). It estimates that "in 2001, 1.1 billion people had consumption levels below $1 a day and 2.7 billion lived on less than $2 a day."<ref name="worldbank-Poverty">{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/0,,contentMDK:20153855~menuPK:373757~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:336992,00.html |title=The World Bank, 2007, Understanding Poverty |publisher=Web.worldbank.org |date=2005-04-19 |accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref> A ''dollar a day'', in nations that do not use the [[U.S. dollar]] as currency, does not translate to living a day on the amount of local currency as determined by the [[exchange rate]]. <ref name=dollar>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7122356.stm|title=When a dollar a day means 25 cents|publisher=bbcnews.com|accessdate=2011-05-28|first=Mukul|last=Devichand|date=2007-12-02}}</ref> Rather, it is determined by the [[purchasing power parity]], which would look at how much local currency is needed to buy the same things that a dollar could buy in the [[United States]]. <ref name=dollar/> Usually, this would translate to less local currency than the exchange rate in poorer countries as the United States is a more expensive country. <ref name=dollar/> .

Other human development indicators have also been improving. [[Life expectancy]] has greatly increased in the developing world since [[World War II]] and is starting to close the gap to the developed world.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} [[Child mortality]] has decreased in every developing region of the world.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The proportion of the world's population living in countries where per-capita food supplies are less than 2,200 calories (9,200 [[kilojoule]]s) per day decreased from 56% in the mid-1960s to below 10% by the 1990s. Similar trends can be observed for literacy, access to clean water and electricity and basic consumer items. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VC6-4F02KWN-8&_user=10&_coverDate=01%2F01%2F2005&_rdoc=1&_fmt=summary&_orig=browse&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=3c12cc79f8121ee4e000396b0273a1eb |title=World Development Volume 33, Issue 1 , January 2005, pages 1–19, Why Are We Worried About Income? Nearly Everything that Matters is Converging |publisher=Sciencedirect.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref> . 

There are various criticisms of these measurements. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://socialanalysis.org/ |title=Institute of Social Analysis |publisher=Socialanalysis.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref> Shaohua Chen and Martin Ravallion note that although "a clear trend decline in the percentage of people who are absolutely poor is evident ... with uneven progress across regions...the developing world outside China and India has seen little or no sustained
progress in reducing the number of poor".  . 

Since the world's population is increasing, a constant number living in poverty would be associated with a diminishing proportion. Looking at the percentage living on less than $1/day, and if excluding China and India, then this percentage has decreased from 31.35% to 20.70% between 1981 and 2004. <ref name=1980s/> . 

The 2007 World Bank report "Global Economic Prospects" predicts that in 2030 the number living on less than the equivalent of $1 a day will fall by half, to about 550 million. An average resident of what we used to call the Third World will live about as well as do residents of the Czech or Slovak republics today. Much of Africa will have difficulty keeping pace with the rest of the developing world and even if conditions there improve in absolute terms, the report warns, Africa in 2030 will be home to a larger proportion of the world's poorest people than it is today....  . 

===Relative poverty===. 
Relative poverty views poverty as socially defined and dependent on [[social context]], hence relative poverty is a measure of income inequality. Usually, relative poverty is measured as the percentage of population with income less than some fixed proportion of median income. There are several other different [[income inequality metrics]], for example the [[Gini coefficient]] or the [[Theil Index]].  . 

Relative poverty measures are used as official poverty rates in several developed countries. As such these poverty statistics measure inequality rather than material deprivation or hardship. The measurements are usually based on a person's yearly income and frequently take no account of total wealth. The main [[poverty line]] used in the [[OECD]] and the [[European Union]] is based on "economic distance", a level of income set at 60% of the median household income. <ref>{{cite news

===Other aspects===. 
Economic aspects of poverty focus on material needs, typically including the necessities of daily living, such as [[food]], clothing, shelter, or safe [[drinking water]]. Poverty in this sense may be understood as a condition in which a person or community is lacking in the [[basic needs]] for a minimum standard of well-being and life, particularly as a result of a persistent lack of income.  . 

Analysis of social aspects of poverty links conditions of scarcity to aspects of the distribution of resources and power in a society and recognizes that poverty may be a function of the diminished "capability" of people to live the kinds of lives they value. The social aspects of poverty may include lack of [[information access|access to information]], [[education]], [[health care]], or [[political power]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paho.org/english/sha/be_v23n1-glossary.htm |title=A Glossary for Social Epidemiology |publisher=World Health Organization |date=March 2002 |accessdate=2011-06-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journalofpoverty.org/JOPPURP/JOPPURP.HTM |title=Journal of Poverty |publisher=Journal of Poverty |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref> . 

Poverty may also be understood as an aspect of unequal [[social status]] and inequitable social relationships, experienced as social exclusion, dependency, and diminished capacity to participate, or to develop meaningful connections with other people in society. <ref>H Silver, 1994, social exclusion and [[Solidarity (sociology)|social solidarity]], in International Labour Review, 133 5–6</ref><ref>G Simmel, The poor, Social Problems 1965 13</ref><ref>P Townsend, 1979, Poverty in the UK, Penguin</ref> Such social exclusion can be minimized through strengthened connections with the mainstream, such as through the provision of [[relational care]] to those who are experiencing poverty.

The World Bank's "Voices of the Poor," based on research with over 20,000 poor people in 23 countries, identifies a range of factors which poor people identify as part of poverty. These include: . 

* Precarious livelihoods
* Excluded locations
* Physical limitations
* Gender relationships
* Problems in social relationships
* Lack of security
* Abuse by those in power
* Dis-empowering institutions
* Limited capabilities
* Weak community organizations . 

David Moore, in his book ''The World Bank'', argues that some analysis of poverty reflect pejorative, sometimes racial, stereotypes of impoverished people as powerless victims and passive recipients of aid programs. <ref>Chapter on Voices of the Poor in David Moore's edited book The World Bank: Development, Poverty, Hegemony (University of KwaZulu-Natal Press, 2007)</ref> . 

Ultra-poverty, a term apparently coined by Michael Lipton,<ref>Lipton, Michael (1986), 'Seasonality and ultra-poverty', Sussex, IDS Bulletin 17.3</ref> connotes being amongst poorest of the poor in low-income countries. Lipton defined ultra-poverty as receiving less than 80 percent of minimum caloric intake whilst spending more than 80% of income on food. Alternatively a 2007 report issued by International Food Policy Research Institute defined ultra-poverty as living on less than 54 cents per day. <ref>International Food Policy Research Institute, [http://www.ifpri.org/publication/worlds-most-deprived The World's Most Deprived. Characteristics and Causes of Extreme Poverty and Hunger], Washington: IFPRI Oct 2007</ref> . 

==Characteristics==. 
The effects of poverty may also be causes, as listed above, thus creating a "poverty cycle" operating across multiple levels, individual, local, national and global.  . 

===Health===. 
{{Main|Diseases of poverty}}
One third of deaths – some 18 million people a year or 50,000 per day – are due to poverty-related causes: in total 270 million people, most of them women and children, have died as a result of poverty since 1990. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/whr/1999 |title=The World Health Report, World Health Organization (See annex table 2) |publisher=Who.int |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref> Those living in poverty suffer disproportionately from hunger or even [[starvation]] and disease. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0724/p01s01-wogi.html |title=Rising food prices curb aid to global poor |publisher=Csmonitor.com |date=2007-07-24 |accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref>

Women who have born children into poverty may not be able to nourish the children efficiently and provide adequate care in infancy.

Research has found that there is a high risk of educational underachievement for children who are from low-income housing circumstances. This often is a process that begins in [[primary school]] for some less fortunate children. Instruction in the US educational system, as well as in most other countries, tends to be geared towards those students who come from more advantaged backgrounds. As a result, these children are at a higher risk than other children for retention in their grade, special placements during the school's hours and even not completing their high school education. <ref name="SYF">Huston, A. C. (1991). Children in Poverty: Child Development and Public Policy. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]]. </ref> There are indeed many explanations for why students tend to drop out of school. For children with low resources, the risk factors are similar to others such as juvenile delinquency rates, higher levels of [[teenage pregnancy]], and the economic dependency upon their low income parent or parents. <ref name="SYF" />
Families and society who submit low levels of investment in the education and development of less fortunate children end up with less favorable results for the children who see a life of parental employment reduction and low wages. Higher rates of early [[pregnancy|childbearing]] with all the connected risks to family, health and well-being are majorly important issues to address since education from preschool to high school are both identifiably meaningful in a life. <ref name="SYF" /> . 

Poverty often drastically affects children's success in school. A child's "home activities, preferences, mannerisms" must align with the world and in the cases that they do not these students are at a disadvantage in the school and most importantly the classroom. <ref name="ANF">Solley, Bobbie A. (2005). When Poverty's Children Write: Celebrating Strengths, Transforming Lives. Portsmouth, NH: Heinemann, Inc. </ref> Therefore, it is safe to state that children who live at or below the poverty level will have far less success educationally than children who live above the poverty line. Poor children have a great deal less healthcare and this ultimately results in many absences from the academic year. Additionally, poor children are much more likely to suffer from hunger, fatigue, irritability, headaches, ear infections, flu, and colds. <ref name="ANF" /> These illnesses could potentially restrict a child or student's focus and concentration.  .

==Poverty reduction==. 
{{main|Poverty reduction}}
{{see also|Aid|Development aid}}
Various poverty reduction strategies are broadly categorized here based on whether they make more of the [[basic needs|basic human needs]] available or increase the [[disposable income]] needed to purchase those needs. Some basic needs, such as improving access to education, may also help increase income.  . 

===Increasing the supply of basic needs===. 
Before the [[industrial revolution]], poverty had been mostly accepted as inevitable as economies produced little, making wealth scarce. <ref name="britannica"/>  The initial industrial revolution led to high economic growth and eliminated mass absolute poverty in what is now considered the developed world. <ref name=britannica/> . 

====Food and other goods====. 
Agricultural technologies such as [[nitrogen fertilizer]]s, [[pesticide]]s and new [[irrigation]] methods have dramatically reduced [[Famine|food shortages]] in modern times by boosting yields past previous constraints. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97jan/borlaug/borlaug.htm |title=Forgotten benefactor of humanity |publisher=Theatlantic.com |date=|accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Justin Rowlatt |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ethicalman/2009/03/is_the_green_movement_part_of_the_problem.html|title=BBC Ethical Man |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2009-03-24 |accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref> [[Mass production]] of goods in places such as rapidly industrializing [[China]] has made what were once considered luxuries, such as vehicles and computers, inexpensive and thus accessible to many who were otherwise too poor to afford them. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/27/world/asia/27laos.html|title=In Laos, Chinese motorcycles change lives|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2011-05-27|first=Thomas|last=Fuller|date=2007-12-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0625/p12s01-woaf.html?page=2 |title=China boosts African economies, offering a second opportunity |publisher=Csmonitor.com|date=2007-06-25 |accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref> . 

====Health care and education====. 
[[Image:Nigerian Surgery Table.jpg|thumb|right|Hardwood surgical tables are commonplace in rural Nigerian clinics.]]
{{See also|Health care system|Primary education}}
[[Infectious diseases]] such as [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]] can perpetuate poverty by diverting health and economic resources from investment and productivity; malaria decreases GDP growth by up to 1.3% in some developing nations and [[AIDS]] decreases African growth by 0.3–1.5% annually. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/211/44385.html |title=Economic costs of AIDS |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |date=2003-07-23 |accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=11832956 |title=The economic and social burden of malaria |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date=2010-09-03 |accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wpro.who.int/media_centre/press_releases/pr_20020916.htm |title=Poverty Issues Dominate WHO Regional Meeting |publisher=Wpro.who.int |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref> Nations do not necessarily need wealth to gain health. <ref name="Disease Control Priorities Project">{{cite web|url=http://www.dcp2.org/main/Home.html|title=Disease Control Priorities Project|publisher=dcp2.org|accessdate=2011-06-21}}</ref> For example, [[Sri Lanka]] had a [[maternal mortality rate]] of 2% in the 1930s, higher than any nation today. <ref name=post>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/02/AR2006040200813.html|title=Saving millions for just a few dollars|publisher=washingtonpost.com |date=2006-04-03 |accessdate=2011-06-21|first=David|last=Brown}}</ref> It reduced it to 0.5–0.6% in the [[1950s]] and to .06% today while spending less each year on [[maternal health]] because it learned what worked and what did not. <ref name=post/> Cheap [[water filter]]s and promoting hand washing are some of the most cost effective health interventions and can cut [[child mortality|death]]s from [[diarrhea]] and [[pneumonia]]. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8399692.stm|title=India's Tata launches water filter for rural poor|publisher=BBC News|date=2009-12-07|accessdate=2011-06-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7670855.stm|title=Millions mark UN hand washing day|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-10-15|accessdate=2011-06-21}}</ref> Knowledge on the cost effectiveness of healthcare interventions can be elusive and educational measures have been made to disseminate what works, such as the [[Copenhagen Consensus]]. <ref name="Disease Control Priorities Project"/> . 

Strategies to provide education cost effectively include [[deworming]] children, which costs about 50 cents per child per year and reduces non-attendance from [[anemia]], [[illness]] and [[malnutrition]], while being only a twenty-fifth as expensive as increasing school attendance by constructing schools. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/22/books/review/Kristof-t.html?_r=1&ref=global-|title=How can we help the world’s poor|publisher=NYTimes|date=2009-11-20|accessdate=2011-06-21}}</ref> A study by [[Oxford University]] shows that schoolgirl absenteeism could be cut in half by providing free [[sanitary towel]]s. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8488375.stm|title=Sanitary pads help Ghana girls go to school|publisher=BBC News|date=2010-01-29|accessdate=2011-06-21}}</ref> Also, when women are given more capabilities and opportunities, they seem more altruistic in helping the family and more likely to prioritize education. <ref name=empower/> . 

Desirable actions such as enrolling children in school or receiving vaccinations can be encouraged by a form of aid known as [[Conditional Cash Transfer]]s. <ref name=Brazil>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/1113/p01s03-woam.html?page=1|title=Brazil becomes antipoverty showcase|publisher=csmonitor.com|date=2008-11-13|accessdate=2011-06-21}}</ref> In [[Mexico]], for example, dropout rates of 16-19 year olds in rural area dropped by 20% and children gained half an inch in height. <ref name=csm>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0921/p06s10-woam.html|title=Latin America makes dent in poverty with ‘conditional cash’ programs|publisher=csmonitor.com|date=2009-09-21|accessdate=2011-06-21}}</ref> Initial fears that the program would encourage families to stay at home rather than work to collect benefits have proven to be unfounded. Instead, there is less excuse for neglectful behavior as, for example, children stopped begging on the streets instead of going to school because it could result in suspension from the program. <ref name=csm/> . 

====Removing constraints on government services====.

The [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]], as primary holders of developing countries' debt, attach [[structural adjustment]] [[Conditionality|conditionalities]] to loans which generally include the elimination of state subsidies and  the [[privatization]] of [[state services]].

{{Main|Guaranteed minimum income|Social security|Welfare}}
A [[guaranteed minimum income]] ensures that every citizen will live be able to purchase a desired level of basic needs. A more specific policy, called a [[basic income]] (or [[negative income tax]]) is a system of [[social security]], that periodically provides each [[citizen]], rich or poor, with a sum of money that is [[sufficient]] to live on. In parts of [[Namibia]], where such a program pays only $13 a month, people were able to pay tuition fees, raising the proportion of children going to school by 92%, while child malnutrition rates fell from 42% to 10% and economic activity grew by 10%. <ref name=Spiegel>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,642310,00.html|title=A new approach to aid: How a basic income program saved a Namibian village|publisher=spiegel.de|accessdate=2011-05-28}}</ref><ref name="Namibians line up">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7415814.stm|title=Namibians line up for free cash|publisher=bbcnews.com|accessdate=2011-05-28|date=2008-05-23}}</ref> Proponents argue that a basic income is more economically efficient than a [[minimum wage]] and [[unemployment benefit]]s, as the minimum wage effectively imposes a high marginal tax on employers, causing [[deadweight loss|losses in efficiency]].  .

====Economic freedoms====. 
{{see also|Economic freedom|Red tape}}
In [[Canada]], it takes two days, two registration procedures, and $280 to open a business{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} while an entrepreneur in [[Bolivia]] must pay $2,696 in fees, wait 82 business days, and go through 20 procedures to do the same.

{{See also|Microcredit}}
Another form of aid is microloans, made famous by the [[Grameen Bank]], where small amounts of money are loaned to farmers or villages, mostly women, who can then obtain physical capital to increase their economic rewards. For example, the [[Thailand|Thai]] government's People's Bank, makes loans of $100 to $300 to help farmers buy equipment or seeds, help street vendors acquire an inventory to sell, or help others set up small shops. However, microlending has been criticized for making hyperprofits off the poor even from its founder, [[Muhammad Yunus]] and in India which has seen a growing wave of defaults and suicides. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/06/business/global/06micro.html|title=Microlenders, honored with Nobel, are struggling|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2011-05-27|first=Vikas|last=Bajaj|date=2011-01-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/world/asia/18micro.html|title=India microcredit faces collapse from defaults|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2011-05-27|first1=Lydia|last1=Polgreen|first2=Vikas|last2=Bajaj|date=2010-11-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/15/opinion/15yunus.html|title=Sacrificing microcredit for megaprofits|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2011-05-27|first=Muhammad|last=Yunus|date=2011-01-14}}</ref> .

====Remittances====.

The World Bank says foreign workers sent $328 billion from richer to poorer countries last year, more than double the $120 billion in official aid flows from [[OECD]] members.

Among some individuals, poverty is considered a necessary or desirable condition, which must be embraced to reach certain spiritual, moral, or intellectual states. Poverty is often understood to be an essential element of [[nekkhamma|renunciation]] in religions such as [[Buddhism]] (only for monks, not for lay persons) and [[Jainism]], whilst in [[Roman Catholicism]] it is one of the [[evangelical counsels]].  . 

[[Benedict XVI]] distinguishes “poverty ''chosen''” (the poverty of spirit proposed by Jesus), and “poverty ''to be fought''” (unjust and imposed poverty). He considers that the moderation implied in the former favors solidarity, and is a necessary condition so as to fight effectively to eradicate the abuse of the latter. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2009/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20090101_world-day-peace_en.html|title=World Peace Day Address 2009|publisher=The Vatican|date=2009-01-01 |accessdate=2011-06-21}}</ref> .

Argues that ideal measures of poverty should: (1) measure comparative historical variation effectively; (2) be relative rather than absolute; (3) conceptualize poverty as social exclusion; (4) assess the impact of taxes, transfers, and state benefits; and (5) integrate the depth of poverty and the inequality among the poor. Next, this article evaluates sociological studies published since 1990 for their consideration of these criteria. This article advocates for three alternative poverty indices: the interval measure, the ordinal measure, and the sum of ordinals measure. Finally, using the [[Luxembourg Income Study]], it examines the empirical patterns with these three measures, across advanced capitalist democracies from 1967 to 1997. Estimates of these poverty indices are made available. </small>
