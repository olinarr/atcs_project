'''''Of The Social Contract, Or Principles of Political Right''''' (''Du contrat social ou Principes du droit politique'') ([[1762]]) by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], is the book in which Rousseau theorized about the best way in which to set up a political [[community]] in the face of the problems of commercial society which he had already identified in his ''[[Discourse on Inequality]]'' ([[1754]]).  .

The ''Social Contract'' was a progressive work that helped inspire political reforms or revolutions in [[Europe]], especially in [[France]]. ''The Social Contract'' argued against the idea that monarchs were divinely empowered to legislate; as Rousseau asserts, only the people, in the form of the sovereign, have that all powerful ''right''.  . 

:''The heart of the idea of the social contract may be stated simply: Each of us places his person and authority under the supreme direction of the [[general will]], and the group receives each individual as an indivisible part of the whole...'' . 

==Overview==. 
[[File:Rousseau pirated edition.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Title page of a pirated edition of the ''Social Contract'', probably printed in Germany. <ref>R.A. Leigh, Unsolved Problems in the Bibliography of J.-J. Rousseau, Cambridge, 1990, plate 22. </ref>]]
The stated aim of the ''Social Contract'' is to determine whether there can be a legitimate political authority. In order to accomplish more and remove himself from the [[state of nature]], man must enter into a Social Contract with others. In this social contract, everyone will be free because all forfeit the same amount of freedom and impose the same duties on all. Rousseau also argues that it is illogical for a man to surrender his freedom for [[slavery]]; and so, the participants must be free. Furthermore, although the contract imposes new laws, especially those safeguarding and regulating [[property]], a person can exit it at any time (except in a time of need, for this is desertion), and is again as free as when he was born.  . 

Rousseau posits that any administration, whatever form it takes, should be divided into two parts. First, there must be the [[sovereign]] (which Rousseau states must consist of the whole population) who represents the [[general will]] and is the legislative power within the state. The second division is that of the [[government]], being distinct from the sovereign. This division must be since the sovereign cannot deal with particular matters (it is then acting as particular wills and not the general will — the sovereign is no longer whole and therefore ruined), like applications of the law. Therefore a government must be separate from that of the sovereign body.  . 

Rousseau claims that the size of the territory to be governed often decides the nature of the government. Since a government is only as strong as the people, and this strength is absolute, the larger the territory the more strength the government must be able to exert over the populace. In his view, a monarchical government is able to wield the most power over the people since it has to devote less power to itself, while a democracy the least. In general, the larger the [[bureaucracy]], the more power required for government discipline. Normally, this relationship requires the state to be an [[aristocracy]] or [[monarchy]]. It is important to note here that when Rousseau talks of aristocracy and monarchy he does not necessarily mean they are not a democracy in the sense we see it now - the aristocracy or monarch could be elected, being like Cabinet Governments or Presidents are today - when Rousseau uses the word democracy he refers to a [[direct democracy]] rather than a [[representative democracy]] like most democratic states have today. In light of all this, Rousseau argues that, like his native [[Geneva]], small [[city-states]] are the form of nation in which freedom can best flourish. For any state large enough to require intermediaries between the people and the government, an elected aristocracy may be preferable, and in very large states a benevolent monarch; but even monarchical rule, to be legitimate, must be subordinate to the sovereign rule of law.  .
