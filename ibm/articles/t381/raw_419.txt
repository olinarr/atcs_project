{{Monarchism|expanded=Related}} . 

A '''monarchy''' is a form of [[government]] in which [[sovereignty]] is actually or nominally embodied in a single individual (the [[monarch]]). <ref>Stuart Berg Flexner and Leonore Crary Hauck, editors, Random House Unabridged Dictionary, 2nd Ed., Random House, New York (1993)</ref> . 

Forms of monarchy differ widely based on the level of legal autonomy the monarch holds in governance, the method of selection of the monarch, and any predetermined limits on the length of their tenure.   When the monarchs has no or few legal restraints in state and political matters, it is called an ''[[absolute monarchy]]'' and is a form of [[autocracy]].  Cases in which the monarch's discretion is formally limited (most common today) are called ''[[constitutional monarchies]]''.  In ''[[hereditary monarchies]]'', the office is passed through inheritance within a family group, whereas ''[[elective monarchies]]'' are selected by some system of voting.  Historically these systems are most commonly combined, either formally or informally, in some manner.   (For instance, in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are considered eligible, whereas many hereditary monarchies have legal requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors that act both as ''de facto'' elections and to create situations of rival claimants whose [[legitimacy]] is subject to effective election.)  Finally, there are situations in which the expiration of a monarch’s [[reign]] is set based either on the calendar or on the achievement of certain goals (repulse of invasion, for instance.)  The effect of historical and geographic difference along each of these three axes is to create widely divergent structures and traditions defining “monarchy.”  .

Monarchy was the most common form of government into the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent, at least at the national level. Where it exists, it now often takes the form of [[constitutional monarchy]], in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no political power pursuant to a constitution or tradition which allocates governing authority elsewhere. Currently, 44 sovereign nations in the world have [[List of current sovereign monarchs|monarchs]] acting as heads of state, 16 of which are [[Commonwealth realm]]s that recognize Queen [[Elizabeth II]] as their head of state. All [[Monarchies in Europe|European monarchies]] are constitutional ones, with the exception of the [[Vatican City]], but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, Jordan, Malaysia and Morocco "reign, but do not rule" although there is considerable variation in the amount of authority they wield. Although they reign under constitutions, the monarchs of [[Brunei]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Swaziland]] appear to continue to exercise more political influence than any other single source of authority in their nations, either by constitutional mandate or by tradition. It is currently being used in England.  .

== Etymology ==. 
The word ''monarch'' ({{lang-la|monarcha}}) comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''monàrches'', ''μονάρχης'' (from ''mònos'', ''μόνος'', "one/singular," and ''àrchon'', ''ἄρχων'', "leader/ruler/chief") which referred to a single, at least nominally absolute  ruler. In current usage the word ''monarchy'' generally refers to a traditional system of hereditary rule, as elective monarchies are rare in the modern period.  . 

==History==. 
[[Tribal kingship]] is often connected to [[sacred king|sacral]] functions, so that the king acts as a priest, or is considered of [[imperial cult|Divine ancestry]]. The sacral function of kingship was transformed into the notion of "[[Divine right of kings]]" in the Christian Middle Ages, while the [[Chinese emperor|Chinese]], [[Japanese emperor|Japanese]] and [[Kingdom of Nepal|Nepalese]] monarchs continued to be considered [[List of people who have been considered deities|living Gods]] into the modern period.  . 

The system of monarchy since antiquity has contrasted with forms of [[democracy]], where executive power is wielded by assemblies of free citizens. In antiquity, monarchies were [[Abolished monarchy|abolished]] in favour of such assemblies in [[Ancient Rome]] ([[Roman Republic]], 509 BC), [[Ancient Athens]] ([[Athenian democracy]], 500 BC).  . 

In [[Germanic antiquity]], [[Germanic king|kingship]] was primarily a sacral function, and the king was elected from among eligible members of royal families by the [[thing (assembly)|thing]]. 
Such ancient "parliamentarism"  declined during the European Middle Ages, but it survived in forms of regional assemblies, such as the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]], the Swiss [[Landsgemeinde]] and later [[Tagsatzung]], and the High Medieval [[Medieval commune|communal movement]] linked to the rise of medieval [[town privileges]].  . 

The modern resurgence of parliamentarism and anti-monarchism began with the overthrow of the [[English monarchy]] by the [[Parliament of England]] in 1649, followed by the [[American Revolution]] of 1776 and the [[French Revolution]] of 1792. Much of 19th century politics was characterized by the division between anti-monarchist [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicalism]] and monarchist [[Conservativism]].  . 

Many countries [[Abolished monarchy|abolished the monarchy]] in the 20th century and became [[republic]]s, especially in the wake of either [[World War I]] or [[World War II]]. 
Advocacy of republics is called [[republicanism]], while advocacy of monarchies is called [[monarchism]].  . 

==Characteristics and role==. 
[[File:Emperor Jimmu.jpg|200px|thumb|left|A 19th century portrayal of [[Emperor Jimmu]], the first [[Emperor of Japan]].]] . 

Monarchies are associated with political or sociocultural [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary rule]], in which monarchs rule for life (although some monarchs do not hold lifetime positions, such as the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] of [[Malaysia]], who serves a five-year term) and pass the responsibilities and power of the position to their children or family when they die. Most monarchs, both historically and in the modern day, have been born and brought up within a [[royal family]], the center of the [[royal household]] and [[Noble court|court]]. Growing up in a royal family (when present for several [[generation]]s it may be called a [[dynasty]]), and [[heir apparent|future monarch]]s were often trained for the responsibilities of expected future rule.  . 

Different systems of [[Order of succession|succession]] have been used, such as [[proximity of blood]], [[primogeniture]], and [[agnatic seniority]] ([[Salic law]]). While traditionally most modern monarchs have been male, many female monarchs also have ruled in history; the term [[queen regnant]] may refer to a ruling monarch, while a [[queen consort]] may refer to the wife of a reigning king. Form of governments may be hereditary without being considered monarchies, such as that of [[family dictatorship]]s<ref>Examples include [[Oliver Cromwell]] and John Morgan was also there along with [[Richard Cromwell]] in the [[Commonwealth of England]], [[Kim il-Sung]] and [[Kim Jong-il]] in [[North Korea]], the [[Somoza family]] in [[Nicaragua]], [[François Duvalier]] and [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]] in [[Haiti]], and [[Hafez al-Assad]] and [[Bashar al-Assad]] in [[Syria]]. </ref> or [[Political family|political families]] in many [[Democracy|democracies]]. <ref>For example, the [[Kennedy family]] in the United States and the [[Nehru-Gandhi family]] in [[India]]. See [[list of political families]]. </ref> . 

The principal advantage of hereditary monarchy is the immediate continuity of leadership, usually with a short [[interregnum]] (as seen in the classic phrase "[[The King is dead. Long live the King!]]").  . 

Some monarchies are non-hereditary. In an [[elective monarchy]], monarchs are [[Election|elected]], or appointed by some body (an [[electoral college]]) for life or a defined period, but otherwise serve as any other monarch. Three elective monarchies exist today, [[Malaysia]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] are twentieth-century creations, while one (the [[Pope|papacy]]) is ancient.  . 

A [[self-proclaimed monarchy]] is established when a person claims the monarchy without any historical ties to a previous dynasty. [[Napoleon I of France]] declared himself [[List of French monarchs|Emperor of the French]] and ruled the [[First French Empire]] after previously calling himself [[First Consul]] following his seizure of power in the coup of [[18 Brumaire]]. [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]] of the [[Central African Republic]] declared himself "Emperor" of the [[Central African Empire]]. [[Yuan Shikai]] crowned himself Emperor of the short-lived "[[Empire of China (1915–1916)|Empire of China]]" a few years after the [[Republic of China]] was founded.  . 

=== Powers of monarch ===. 
Today, the extent of a monarch's powers varies:
*In an [[absolute monarchy]], the monarch rules as an [[Autocracy|autocrat]], with absolute power over the state and government&mdash;for example, the right to [[rule by decree]], promulgate [[law]]s, and impose [[punishment]]s. Absolute monarchies are not necessarily [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]]; the [[Enlightened absolutism|enlightened absolutists]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] were monarchs who allowed various freedoms. 
*In a [[constitutional monarchy]] the monarch is subject to a [[constitution]]. The monarch serves as a ceremonial [[figurehead]] [[symbol]] of national unity and state continuity. The monarch is nominally [[sovereignty|sovereign]] but the electorate, through their [[parliament]]/[[legislature]], exercise usually limited political sovereignty. Constitutional monarchs have limited [[political power]], except in Japan, where the constitution grants no power to the Emperor.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Typical monarchical powers include granting [[pardon]]s, granting [[honour system|honours]], and [[reserve power]]s, e.g. to dismiss the [[prime minister]], refuse to dissolve parliament, or [[veto]] legislation ("withhold [[Royal Assent]]"). They often also have privileges of [[inviolability]], [[sovereign immunity]], and an [[official residence]]. A monarch's powers and influence may depend on tradition, precedent, popular opinion, and [[law]]. 
*In other cases the monarch's power is limited, not due to constitutional restraints, but to effective [[Military dictatorship|military rule]]. In the late [[Roman Empire]], the [[Praetorian Guard]] several times deposed [[Roman Emperor]]s and installed new emperors. The Hellenistic kings of [[Macedon]] and of [[Epirus]] were elected by the army, which was similar in composition to the ''[[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|ecclesia]]'' of [[democracies]], the council of all free citizens; military service often was linked with citizenship among the male members of the royal house. Military domination of the monarch has occurred in modern [[Thailand]] and in [[medieval Japan]] (where a hereditary military chief, the [[shogun]] was the de facto ruler, although the [[Emperor of Japan|Japanese emperor]] nominally ruled). In [[Italian fascism|Fascist Italy]] the [[House of Savoy|Savoy]] monarchy under King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] coexisted with the [[Italian Fascist Party|Fascist]] single-party rule of [[Benito Mussolini]]; [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] under the [[Iron Guard]] and [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] during the first months of the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|Colonels' regime]] were much the same way. [[Spain under Franco|Spain under Francisco Franco]] was officially a monarchy, although there was no monarch on the throne. Upon his death, Franco was succeeded as head of state by the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] heir, [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]], who proceeded to [[Spanish transition to democracy|make Spain a democracy]] with himself as a figurehead constitutional monarch.{{citation needed|whole item|date=December 2011}} . 

=== Person of monarch ===. 
[[File:Ruling-monarchs.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Postcard of ruling monarchs, taken in 1908 between February (accession of [[Manuel II of Portugal|King Manuel II of Portugal]]) and November (death of [[Guangxu Emperor]]).]] . 

Most states only have a single person acting as monarch at any given time, although two monarchs have ruled simultaneously in some countries, a situation known as [[diarchy]]. Historically this was the case in the ancient [[Greek city-state]] of [[Sparta]] or 17th-century Russia, and there are examples of joint sovereignty of spouses or relatives (such as [[William and Mary]] in the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]]). Other examples of joint sovereignty include [[Tsar]]s [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] and [[Ivan V of Russia|Ivan V]] of [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[Joanna of Castile]] of the [[Crown of Castile]].  . 

[[Andorra]] currently is the world's sole constitutional diarchy or co-principality. Located in the [[Pyrenees]] between [[Spain]] and [[France]], it has two co-princes: the [[Diocese of Urgell|Bishop of Urgell]] (a [[prince-bishop]]) in Spain and the [[President of France]]. It is the only situation in which an independent country's monarch is [[Democracy|democratically]] elected by the citizens of another country.  . 

In a [[personal union]], separate independent states share the same crown with one person as the  monarch. The sixteen separate [[Commonwealth realm]]s are sometimes described as being in a personal union with Queen Elizabeth II as monarch, however, legally each Commonwealth Realm has its own crown or monarchy, so they can also be described as being in a ''Shared Monarchy''.  . 

A [[regent]] may rule when the monarch is a [[Minor (law)|minor]], absent, or debilitated.  . 

A [[pretender]] is a claimant to an abolished throne or to a throne already occupied by somebody else.  . 

[[Abdication]] is when a monarch resigns.  . 

Monarchs often take part in certain ceremonies, such as a [[coronation]].  . 

=== Role of religion ===. 
Monarchy, especially absolute monarchy, sometimes is linked to [[Religion|religious]] aspects; many monarchs once claimed the right to rule by the will of a [[deity]] ([[Divine Right of Kings]], [[Mandate of Heaven]]), a special connection to a deity ([[sacred king]]) or even purported to be divine kings, or [[incarnation]]s of deities themselves ([[imperial cult]]). Many European monarchs have been styled ''[[Fidei defensor]]'' (Defender of the Faith); some hold official positions relating to the [[state religion]] or established church.  . 

In the Western [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] political tradition, a morally-based, ''balanced'' monarchy is stressed as the ideal form of government, and little reverence is paid to modern-day ideals of egalitarian democracy: e.g. [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]] unapologetically declares: "Tyranny is wont to occur not less but more frequently on the basis of polyarchy [rule by many, i.e. oligarchy or democracy] than on the basis of monarchy." (''On Kingship''). However, Thomas Aquinas also stated that the ideal monarchical system would also have at lower levels of government both an aristocracy and elements of democracy in order to created a balance of power. The monarch would also be subject to both natural and divine law, as well, and also be subject to the [[Catholic Church|Church]] in matters of religion.  . 

In [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''De Monarchia'', a spiritualized, imperial Catholic monarchy is strongly promoted according to a [[Ghibelline]] world-view in which the "royal religion of [[Melchizedek]]" is emphasized against the sacerdotal claims of the rival papal ideology.  . 

In [[Muslim World]], The [[King of Saudi Arabia]] is a head of state who is both a absolute monarch of country, and [[Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques]] of Islam (خادم الحرمين الشريفين).  . 

=== Titles of monarchs ===. 
Monarchs have various [[title]]s, including [[king]] or [[Queen regnant|queen]], [[prince]] or [[princess]] ([[Sovereign Prince of Monaco]]), [[emperor]] or [[empress]] ([[Emperor of Japan]], [[Emperor of India]]), or even [[duke]] or [[grand duke]] ([[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]]) or duchess. Many monarchs also are distinguished by [[Style (manner of address)|styles]], such as "[[Majesty]]", "[[Royal Highness]]" or "[[By the Grace of God]]". Islamic monarchs use titles such as [[Shah]], [[Caliph]], [[Sultan]], [[Emir]] and [[Sheikh]].  In Mongolian or Turkic lands, the monarch may use the title [[Khan (title)|Khan]] or [[Khagan]].  . 

Sometimes titles are used to express claims to territories that are not held in fact (for example, [[English claims to the French throne]]) or titles not recognized ([[antipope]]s).  . 

=== Dependent monarchies ===. 
In some cases monarchs are dependent on other powers (see [[vassal]]s, [[suzerainty]], [[puppet state]], [[hegemony]]). In the British colonial era [[indirect rule]] under a [[paramount power]] existed, such as the [[princely state]]s under the [[British Raj]].  . 

In [[Botswana]], [[South Africa]], [[Ghana]] and [[Uganda]], the ancient kingdoms and [[chiefdom]]s that were met by the colonialists when they first arrived on the continent are now constitutionally protected as regional and/or sectional entities. Furthermore, in [[Nigeria]], though the hundreds of [[List of Nigerian traditional states|sub-regional polities]] that exist there are not provided for in the current constitution, they are nevertheless legally recognised aspects of the structure of governance that operates in the nation. In addition to these five countries, peculiar monarchies of varied sizes and complexities exist in various other parts of [[Africa]].  . 

== Succession ==. 
The rules for selection of monarchs varies from country to country. In constitutional monarchies the rule of succession generally is embodied in a law passed by a representative body, such as a [[parliament]].  . 

=== Hereditary monarchies ===. 
In a [[hereditary monarchy]], the position of monarch is inherited according to a statutory or customary [[order of succession]], usually within one [[royal family]] tracing its origin through a historical [[dynasty]] or bloodline. This usually means that the heir to the throne is known well in advance of becoming monarch to ensure a smooth succession.   . 

[[Primogeniture]], in which the eldest child of the monarch is first in line to become monarch, is the most common system in hereditary monarchy. The order of succession is usually affected by rules on gender. Historically "agnatic primogeniture"  or "patrilineal primogeniture" was favoured, that is inheritance according to seniority of birth among the sons of a monarch or [[paterfamilias|head of family]], with sons and their male issue inheriting before brothers and their issue, and [[patrilineality|male-line]] males inheriting before females of the male line. <ref name="Murphy">{{cite web| last = Murphy| first = Michael Dean| title = A Kinship Glossary: Symbols, Terms, and Concepts| url = http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/436/kinship.htm| accessdate = 2006-10-05 }}</ref> This is the same as semi-Salic primogeniture. Complete exclusion of females from [[dynasty|dynastic]] succession is commonly referred to as application of the [[Salic law]] (see ''[[Terra salica]]'').   . 

Before primogeniture was enshrined in European law and tradition, kings would often secure the succession by having their successor (usually their eldest son) crowned during their own lifetime, so for a time there would be two kings in [[coregency]] &ndash; a senior king and a junior king.  Examples include [[Henry the Young King]] of England and the early [[House of Capet|Direct Capetians]] in France.  . 

Sometimes, however, primogeniture can operate through the female line. In some systems a female may rule as monarch only when the male line dating back to a common ancestor is exhausted.  In 1980, [[Sweden]] became the first European monarchy to declare equal (full cognatic) primogeniture, meaning that the eldest child of the monarch, whether female or male, ascends to the throne. <ref>SOU 1977:5 ''Kvinnlig tronföljd'', p.16. </ref> Other kingdoms (such as the [[Netherlands]] in 1983, [[Norway]] in 1990, [[Belgium]] in 1991, and the [[United Kingdom]] in 2011) have since followed suit. Sometimes [[religion]] is affected; under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] all [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] and all persons who have married Roman Catholics are ineligible to be the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]] and are skipped in the order of succession.  . 

In the case of the absence of children, the next most senior member of the collateral line (for example, a younger sibling of the previous monarch) becomes monarch. In complex cases, this can mean that there are closer blood relatives to the deceased monarch than the next in line according to primogeniture. This has often led, especially in Europe in the [[Middle Ages]], to conflict between the principle of primogeniture and the principle of [[proximity of blood]], with outcomes that were idiosyncratic{{clarify|idiosyncratic outcomes|date=December 2011}}.  . 

Other hereditary systems of succession included [[tanistry]], which is semi-elective and gives weight to merit and [[Agnatic seniority]].  In some monarchies, such as [[Saudi Arabia]], succession to the throne usually first passes to the monarch's next eldest brother, and only after that to the monarch's children (agnatic seniority).  . 

=== Elective monarchies===. 
In an [[elective monarchy]], monarchs are [[Election|elected]], or appointed by some body (an [[electoral college]]) for life or a defined period, but otherwise serve as any other monarch. There is no popular vote involved in elective monarchies, as the elective body usually consists of a small number of eligible people. Historical examples of elective monarchy include the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s (chosen by [[prince-elector]]s, but often coming from the same dynasty), and the [[Royal elections in Poland|free election]] of kings of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. For example, [[Pepin the Short]] (father of [[Charlemagne]]) was elected [[List of Frankish kings|King of the Franks]] by an assembly of Frankish leading men; [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]] of Poland was an elected king, as was [[Frederick I of Denmark]]. [[Germanic peoples]] had elective monarchies.  . 

Three elective monarchies exist today. The [[pope]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (who rules as [[Sovereign]] of the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]]) is elected to a life term by the [[College of Cardinals]]. In [[Malaysia]], the federal king, called the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] ("Paramount Ruler") is elected for a five-year term from and by the hereditary rulers (mostly [[sultan]]s) of nine of the federation's constitutive [[States of Malaysia|states]], all on the [[Malay peninsula]]. The [[United Arab Emirates]] also has a procedure for electing its monarch.  . 

Appointment by the current monarch is another system, used in [[Jordan]]. In this system, the monarch chooses the successor, who is always his relative.  . 

{{see also|jure uxoris}} . 

== Current monarchies ==. 
Currently there are 44 (or 45) nations in the world with a monarch as head of state. They fall roughly into the following categories: . 

* '''[[Commonwealth realm]]s'''. The sixteen Commonwealth realms ([[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Australia]], [[Bahamas]], [[Barbados]], [[Belize]], [[Canada]], [[Grenada]], [[Jamaica]], [[New Zealand]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[Tuvalu]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]) all share Queen [[Elizabeth II]] as monarch in a [[personal union]] arrangement. They all share a common British inheritance and have evolved out of the [[British Empire]] into membership of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] as fully independent states where they retain Queen Elizabeth as head of state; unlike other members of the Commonwealth of Nations which are either dependencies, republics or have a different royal house. All sixteen realms are constitutional monarchies and full democracies where the queen has limited powers or a largely ceremonial role. The queen is head of the established Protestant Christian [[Church of England]] in the United Kingdom however, the other monarchies do not have an established church.  . 

* '''Other European constitutional monarchies'''. [[Andorra]], [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Spain]], and [[Sweden]] are fully democratic states in which the monarch has a limited or largely ceremonial role. There is generally a Christian religion established as the official church in each of these countries. This is a form of [[Protestantism]] in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands, while Belgium, Luxembourg, Andorra, and Spain are [[Roman Catholic]] countries.  . 

* '''European Constitutional/Absolute Monarchies''' [[Prince of Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein]] and [[Prince of Monaco|Monaco]] are constitutional monarchies in which the Prince retains many powers of an absolute monarch. For example the [[Liechtenstein constitutional referendum, 2003|2003 Constitution referendum]] which gives the [[Prince of Liechtenstein]] the power to veto any law that the [[Landtag]] proposes and the Landtag can veto any law that the Prince tries to pass. The Prince can hire or dismiss any elective member or government employee from his or her post. However what makes him not an absolute monarchy is that the people can call for a referendum to end the monarchy's reign. The [[Prince of Monaco]] has simpler powers but can not hire or dismiss any elective member or government employee from his or her post, but he can elect the [[Minister of State of Monaco|minister of state]], [[Politics of Monaco|government council]] and judges. Both [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco|Albert II]] and [[Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein|Hans-Adam II]] have quite a bit of political power, but they also own huge tracts of land and are shareholders in many companies.  . 

* '''Islamic monarchies'''. These Islamic monarchs of [[Bahrain]], [[Brunei]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Malaysia]], [[Morocco]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]] generally retain far more powers than their European or Commonwealth counterparts. Brunei, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia remain absolute monarchies; Bahrain, Kuwait and United Arab Emirates are classified as mixed, meaning there are representative bodies of some kind, but the monarch retains most of his powers. Jordan, Malaysia and Morocco are constitutional monarchies, but their monarchs still retain more substantial powers than European equivalents. Malaysia could also be considered as an East Asian constitutional monarchy (see next).  . 

* '''East Asian constitutional monarchies'''. [[Bhutan]], [[Cambodia]], [[Japan]], [[Thailand]] have constitutional monarchies where the monarch has a limited or ceremonial role. Bhutan, Japan, and Thailand are countries that were never colonised by European powers, but have changed from traditional absolute monarchies into constitutional ones during the twentieth century. Cambodia had its own monarchy after independence from France, which was deposed after the Khmer Rouge came into power and the subsequent invasion by Vietnam. The monarchy was subsequently restored in the peace agreement of 1993. [[Shintoism]] is the established religion in Japan, while Bhutan, Cambodia and Thailand are all [[Buddhist]] countries. However, most Japanese people practice Buddhism and Shinto simultaneously.  . 

* '''Other monarchies'''. Five monarchies do not fit into one of the above groups by virtue of geography or class of monarchy: [[Tonga]] and [[Samoa]] in [[Polynesia]]; [[Swaziland]] and [[Lesotho]] in Africa; and the [[Vatican City]] in Europe. Of these, Lesotho and Tonga are constitutional monarchies, while  Swaziland and Vatican City are absolute monarchies. Samoa falls into neither class, as one of the Four Paramount Chiefs of the country is elected to hold the position of [[O le Ao o le Malo]], or "Chieftain of the Government".  This position is not required by the Samoan constitution, which is why Samoa is officially classified as a republic rather than a constitutional monarchy. The [[pope]] is monarch of Vatican City by virtue of his position as head of the [[Catholic Church]]; he is an elected rather than hereditary ruler.  .
