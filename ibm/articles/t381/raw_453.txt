The '''Australian Monarchist League''' is a [[non-profit organisation]], headquartered in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], promoting the [[monarchy of Australia]], and providing information to members of the public about Australian history and the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]]. The organisation was part of the "no" campaign in the [[Australian republic referendum, 1999|1999 republic referendum]], which asked whether Australia should become a republic and whether Australia should alter the constitution to insert a [[preamble]]. Neither of the amendments passed.  . 

==Structure== . 

The Australian Monarchist League is incorporated as an association in [[New South Wales]], and were originally founded as a branch of the [[London]]-based [[International Monarchist League]] (IML). However, in 1993, the League severed affiliation with the IML, established itself as an independent Australian body. (A separate organisation, the [[International Monarchist League in Australia|Monarchist League in Australia]], was formed in 2006 as an affiliate of the IML). <ref name="Mitchell2006-06-11">{{cite news | last = Mitchell | first = Alex | date = 11 June 2006 | title = Naming tiff divides wild colonial fan groups | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | location = [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/naming-tiff-divides-wild-colonial-fan-groups/2006/06/10/1149815366716.html | accessdate = 19 December 2009 }}</ref> The organisation is not formally associated with any political party or other organisation, and it has no paid staff, relying on volunteers to keep the group functioning. <ref name="AboutUs">{{cite web | title = About Us | work = Australian Monarchist League | url = http://www.monarchist.org.au/aboutus.html | accessdate = 23 December 2009 }}</ref> Philip Benwell, a [[merchant banker]], has served on a volunteer basis as the national chairman and spokesman for the league for over ten years. <ref name="AMLPhilipBenwell">{{cite web | title = Philip Benwell | work = The Australian Monarchist League | url = http://www.monarchist.org.au/philip-benwell.html | accessdate = 4 January 2010 }}</ref> .

=== 1999 republic referendum ===. 
{{main|Australian republic referendum, 1999|Australian Constitutional Convention 1998}}
During the 1999 republic referendum on the future of Australia's [[constitutional monarchy]], the league took what was seen as a hardline approach, focusing on defending the monarchy â€“ an approach that was quite different to the one that was favoured by some involved in the No campaign, who tended towards downplaying the monarchy and emphasising the weaknesses of the republican models on offer. <ref name="Symons1999-03-02">{{cite news | last = Symons | first = Emma-Kate | date = 2 March 1999 | title = Queen ignored in fight against republic | work = [[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]] | location = [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] | page = 18 }}</ref> As a result, it was an alternative organisation, [[Australians for Constitutional Monarchy]], who were chosen by then Prime Minister [[John Howard]] to help head up the No campaign (along with those supporting an elected head of state). <ref name="Warhurst2009-08-27">{{cite news | last = Warhurst | first = John | date = 27 August 2009 | title = League's booklet sets battlelines for the monarchy debate | work = [[The Canberra Times]] | location = [[Canberra]], [[Australia]]}}</ref> Nevertheless, the Australian Monarchist League played a role in the proceedings, including Benwell privately taking the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] to the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] in an unsuccessful attempt to gain a firmer definition of what would count as a "yes" vote in the referendum, arguing that the planned approach (accepting any vote in which the voter's intention was clear) was such that the counting would be weighted towards "yes" and "opened the door for electoral fraud". <ref name="Benwell1999-11-04">{{cite news | last = Benwell | first = Philip | date = 4 November 1999 | title = Valid votes | work = [[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] | location = [[Adelaide]], [[Australia]] | page = 17 }}</ref><ref name="Crabb1999-11-04">{{cite news | last = Crabb | first = Annabel | date = 4 November 1999 | title = The Republic Vote Monarchist league's non non to oui oui | work = [[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] | location = [[Adelaide]], [[Australia]] | page = 7 }}</ref><ref name="Hilferty1999-11-03">{{cite news | last1 = Hilferty | first = Tim | last2 = Luff | first2 = David | date = 3 November 1999 | title = Queen case claims bias | work = [[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]] | location = [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] | page = 8 }}</ref><ref name="HobartMercury1999-11-05">{{cite news | date = 5 November 1999 | title = Setback for monarchists | work = [[The Mercury (Hobart)|Hobart Mercury]] | location = [[Hobart]], [[Australia]] }}</ref> . 

=== Recent activities ===. 
Both prior and subsequent to the referendum, the Australian Monarchist League has acted to protect the image of the constitutional monarchy. In 2005 the organisation lodged formal complaints about an image depicting [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] by photographer [[Erwin Olaf]] at the Australian Centre for Photography. <ref name="O'Connor2005-08-12">{{cite news | last = Shaunagh | first = O'Connor | date = 12 August 2005 | title = A right royal shocker | work = [[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]] | location = [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] | page = 87 }}</ref> Similarly, they wrote to the Japanese ambassador in 1998 after [[Toyota]] ran an advertisement showing a [[Range Rover]] with the words "Don't worry, Your Majesty, you're not the only British export that's had its day", resulting in Toyota withdrawing the advertisement;<ref name="Watson-Smyth1998-03-20">{{cite news | last = Watson-Smyth | first = Kate | date = 20 March 1998 | title = Ford forced to pull Full Monty ad | work = [[The Independent]] | location = [[London]], [[United Kingdom]] | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/ford-forced-to-pull-full-monty-ad-1151187.html | accessdate = 4 January 2010 }}</ref> and in 2008 complained to both the [[Coopers Brewery]] and the [[Advertising Standards Bureau (Australia)|Advertising Standards Bureau]] after Coopers ran an advertisement stating "Forget the monarchy, support the publicans", forcing its withdrawal. <ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/07/28/2316512.htm?site=local Monarchists upset by beer ad], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]], 28 July 2008</ref> . 

Along with their actions during the referendum, the League have been active in protecting the symbols of Australia's constitutional monarchy; they acted to ensure that the pledge of loyalty to the monarch remained a part of [[Scouts Australia]],<ref name="Harvey2000-06-24">{{cite news | last = Harvey | first = Claire | date = 24 June 2000 | title = Scouts prepared to back Queen | work = [[The Australian|The Weekend Australian]] | location = [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] | page = 18 }}</ref> and spoke against the removal of references to the Queen from the Victorian legal system. <ref name="HeraldSun2009-12-19">{{cite news | date = 19 December 2009 | title = Smokers, royalists butted out | work = [[Herald Sun]] | location = [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] | page = 9 }}</ref> Aside from campaigning, the AML distributed copies of [[William Dargie|William Dargie's]] portrait of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] after the Commonwealth Government Bookshops ceased selling photographs of the monarch. <ref name="AMLAboutUs">{{cite web | title = About Australian Monarchist League | work = Australian Monarchist League | url = http://www.monarchist.org.au/aboutus.html | accessdate = 5 January 2010 }}</ref> .
