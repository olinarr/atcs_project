During the [[French Revolution]], the '''proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy''' was a proclamation by the [[National Convention]] of France announcing that it had abolished the French monarchy on 21 September 1792.  . 

==Prelude==. 
The Convention's députés were instructed to put an end to the crisis that had broken out since the prevented [[flight to Varennes]] of [[Louis XVI]] (June 1791) and the bloody capture of the [[Tuileries]] ([[10 August (French Revolution)|10 August]] 1792). Their middle class origin and their political activity meant that most of them bore no sympathy for the monarchy and the victory at the [[battle of Valmy]] on 20 September (the revolution's first military success) occurred on the same day as their meeting, thus confirming their convictions.  . 

== Proposition for abolition ==. 
When the député for Paris, [[Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois]], proposed abolition he met with little resistance – at most [[Claude Basire]], friend of [[Georges Jacques Danton]], tried to temper the enthusiasm, recommending a discussion before any decision. However, abbé [[Henri Grégoire]], [[constitutional bishop]] of [[Blois]], replied strongly to any suggestion of discussion:
{{Cquote|What need do we have of discussion when everyone is in agreement? Kings are as much monsters in the moral order as in the physical order. The Courts are a workshop for crime, the foyer for corruption and the den of tyrants. The history of kings is the [[martyrology]] of nations!}}
[[Jean-François Ducos]] supported him in affirming that any discussion would be useless "after the lights spread by 10 August". This summary argument served as a debate and the decision taken was unanimous, giving birth to the [[First French Republic]]. Surprised by its own daring and needing to convince itself this was the right decision, the Convention decided to date all official acts not from 1789 (i.e. making 1792 "year 4 of liberty") but from the pronouncement (making the year after it "year 1 of the Republic").  .
