{{Politics of New Zealand}}
The '''monarchy of New Zealand'''{{spaced ndash}}also referred to as ''The Crown in Right of New Zealand'', ''Her Majesty in Right of New Zealand'', or ''The Queen in Right of New Zealand''{{spaced ndash}}is the [[constitution]]al system of government in which a [[Heredity|hereditary]] [[monarch]] is the [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] and [[head of state]] of the [[Realm of New Zealand]],<small><ref name=Buck1>{{cite web| url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/NewZealand/NewZealand.aspx| last=The Royal Household| title=The Queen and the Commonwealth > Queen and New Zealand| publisher=Queen's Printer| accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref><ref name=EIIR2.1>{{Citation| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom| publication-date=13 December 1986| title=Constitution Act, 1986| series=2.1| publication-place=Wellington| publisher=Queen's Printer for New Zealand| url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1986/0114/latest/whole.html#dlm94204| accessdate=30 December 2009| ref=CITEREF_Elizabeth_II_1986}}</ref></small> forming the core of the country's [[Westminster system|Westminster-style]] [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[democracy]]. The Crown is thus the foundation of the [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[Legislature|legislative]], and [[Judiciary|judicial]] branches of the [[Politics of New Zealand|New Zealand government]]. <small><ref>{{citation| last=Cabinet Office| authorlink=Cabinet of New Zealand| title=Cabinet Manual| year=2008| pages=1–2| publisher=Queen's Printer| url=http://cabinetmanual.cabinetoffice.govt.nz/files/manual.pdf| isbn=978-0-477-10067-0| accessdate=31 December 2009| ref=CITEREF_Cabinet_Office_2008}}</ref></small></small> . 

While [[Royal Assent]] and the [[royal sign-manual]] are required to enact laws, [[letters patent]], and [[Order in Council|Orders in Council]], the authority for these acts stems from the New Zealand populace,<small><ref name=CO3>{{Harvnb| Cabinet Office| 2008| p=3}}</ref></small> and, within the [[Convention (norm)#Government|conventional]] stipulations of [[constitutional monarchy]], the sovereign's direct participation in any of these areas of governance is limited, with most related powers entrusted for exercise by the elected [[Parliament of New Zealand|parliamentarians]], the [[Minister of the Crown|ministers of the Crown]] generally drawn from amongst them, and the [[Politics of New Zealand#Judiciary|judges]] and [[Justice of the Peace#New Zealand|Justices of the Peace]].  . 

The New Zealand monarchy has its roots in the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British crown]], from which it has evolved to become a distinctly New Zealand institution, represented by unique symbols. The New Zealand monarch{{spaced ndash}}since 6 February 1952, [[Elizabeth II]]{{spaced ndash}}is today [[Personal union|shared]] equally with [[Commonwealth realm|fifteen other countries]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], all being independent and the monarchy of each legally distinct. For New Zealand, the monarch is officially titled ''Queen of New Zealand'', and she, her [[List of New Zealand monarchs#List of Royal Consorts of New Zealand|consort]], and other members of the New Zealand Royal Family undertake various public and private functions across New Zealand and on behalf of the country abroad. However, the Queen is the only member of the Royal Family with any [[Constitution of New Zealand|constitutional]] role. While several powers are the sovereign's alone, because she lives predominantly in the United Kingdom, most of the royal constitutional and ceremonial duties in New Zealand and [[Niue]] are carried out by the Queen's [[viceroy]], the [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor-General]] and the [[Queen's Representative]] in [[The Cook Islands]]. <small><ref>{{Harvnb| Cabinet Office| 2008| p=7}}</ref></small> As the territories of the Realm of New Zealand are not sovereign, they do not have a viceregal representation.  . 

==International and domestic aspects==. 
:''Further information: [[Commonwealth realm#Relationship of the realms|Commonwealth realm > Relationship of the realms]]''
New Zealand shares the same monarch with each of 15 monarchies in the 54-member [[Commonwealth of Nations]], a grouping known informally as the [[Commonwealth realm]]s. The emergence of this arrangement paralleled the evolution of New Zealand nationalism following the end of the [[World War I|First World War]] and culminated in the passage of the [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947|Statute of Westminster Adoption Act]] in 1947, since when the pan-national Crown has had both a shared and separate character,<small><ref>{{cite journal| last=Trepanier| first=Peter| title=Some Visual Aspects of the Monarchical Tradition| journal=Canadian Parliamentary Review| volume=27| issue=2| page=28| publisher=Commonwealth Parliamentary Association| location=Ottawa| year=2004| url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/27/2/27n2_04e_trepanier.pdf| accessdate=8 October 2009}}</ref></small> and the sovereign's role as monarch of New Zealand has been distinct to his or her position as monarch of the United Kingdom. <small><ref name=Buck1 /></small> The monarchy thus ceased to be an exclusively British institution, and in New Zealand became a New Zealand establishment, though it is still often misnomered as "British" in both legal and common language, for reasons historical, political, and of convenience; this conflicts with not only the government's recognition and promotion of a distinctly New Zealand Crown, but also the sovereign's distinct New Zealand title.  . 

Effective with the [[Constitution Act 1986]], no British or other realm government can advise the sovereign on any matters pertinent to New Zealand, meaning that on all matters of the New Zealand state, the monarch is advised solely by New Zealand [[Minister of the Crown|Ministers of the Crown]]. <small><ref name=Buck2>{{cite web| url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/NewZealand/TheQueensroleinNewZealand.aspx| last=The Royal Household| title=The Queen and the Commonwealth > Queen and New Zealand > The Queen's role in New Zealand| publisher=Queen's Printer| accessdate=1 January 2010}}</ref></small> As the monarch lives predominantly outside of New Zealand, one of the most important of these state duties carried out on the advice of the Prime Minister of New Zealand is the appointment of the [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor-General]], who performs most of the Queen's domestic duties in her absence. <small><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gg.govt.nz/role| last=Office of the Governor-General of New Zealand| authorlink=Governor-General of New Zealand| title=Role & Functions > The Role of the Governor-General| publisher=Queen's Printer| accessdate=15 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Citation| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom| publication-date=28 October 1983| title=Letters Patent Constituting the Office of Governor-General of New Zealand| series=I-IV| publication-place=Wellington| publisher=Queen's Printer for New Zealand| url=http://cabinetmanual.cabinetoffice.govt.nz/files/manual.pdf| accessdate=4 January 2010| ref=CITEREF_Elizabeth_II_1983}}</ref><ref name=CO8>{{Harvnb| Cabinet Office| 2008| p=8}}</ref></small> All royal powers in New Zealand may be carried out by both the monarch and Governor-General, and, in New Zealand law, the offices of monarch and Governor-General are fully interchangeable, mention of one always simultaneously including the other. <small><ref>{{Harvnb| Elizabeth II| 1986| loc=3.2}}</ref></small> . 

=== Cost ===. 
The sovereign similarly only draws from New Zealand coffers for support in the performance of her duties when in New Zealand or acting as Queen of New Zealand abroad; New Zealanders do not pay any money to the Queen or any other member of the Royal Family, either towards personal income or to support royal residences outside of New Zealand. Normally, tax dollars pay only for the costs associated with the Governor-General and Queen's Representative as instruments of the Queen's authority, including travel, security, residences, offices, ceremonies, and the like. Supporters of the monarchy argue it costs New Zealand taxpayers only a small outlay for royal engagements and tours, and the expenses of the Governor-General's establishment. Monarchy New Zealand states "[t]his figure is about one dollar per person per year", about $4.3 million per annum. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monarchy.org.nz/cost.html|title=Cost of the Monarchy|publisher=[[Monarchy New Zealand]]|year=2009|accessdate=2010-10-02}}</ref> An analysis by the Republican Movement of the 2010 Budget shows the office of Governor-General costs New Zealand taxpayers about $7.6 million in ongoing costs and $11 million for Government House upgrades, a total of $18.6 million. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.govt.nz/budget/2010/estimates/est10pmcab.pdf|title=Vote Prime Minister and Cabinet|publisher=[[New Zealand Treasury]]|pages=269–270|date=May 2010|accessdate=2010-10-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.republic.org.nz/defendingthemonarchy#cost|title=Defending the monarchy - the cost|publisher=[[Republican Movement of Aotearoa New Zealand]]|year=2010|accessdate=2010-09-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1005/S00221.htm|title=Governor-General more expensive|date=20 May 2010|publisher=[[Scoop.co.nz]]|author=Republican Movement}}</ref> These figures are disputed by Monarchy New Zealand, who claim the Republican Movement "arbitrarily inflated the cost of the Governor-General". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monarchy.org.nz/images/documents/press/28%20October%202010.pdf|title=Monarchy New Zealand Calls for the Resignation of Republican Chair|date=28 October 2010|accessdate=15 November 2010}}</ref> . 

===Succession===. 
Succession is by [[Primogeniture|male-preference primogeniture]] governed by both the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], and [[Bill of Rights 1689]], legislation that limits the succession to the natural (i.e. non-[[Adoption|adopted]]), legitimate descendants of [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia, Electress of Hanover]], and stipulates that the monarch cannot be a [[Roman Catholic]], nor married to one, and must be in communion with the [[Church of England]] upon ascending the throne. Though, via [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947|adopting the Statute of Westminster]] and the [[Imperial Laws Application Act 1988]], these constitutional documents as they apply to New Zealand now lie within the full control of the [[Parliament of New Zealand|New Zealand parliament]],<small><ref name=CO2>{{Harvnb| Cabinet Office| 2008| p=2}}</ref></small> New Zealand also agreed not to change its rules of succession without the unanimous consent of the other realms, unless explicitly leaving the shared monarchy relationship; a situation that applies [[Symmetry|symmetrically]] in all the other realms, including the United Kingdom, and has been likened to a [[treaty]] amongst these countries. <small><ref name=ODonohue>{{cite court| litigants=Tony O'Donohue v. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada| vol=41404 (ON S.C.)| pinpoint=S.33| court=Ontario Superior Court of Justice| year=2003| url=http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2003/2003canlii41404/2003canlii41404.html| accessdate=16 May 2009}}</ref></small> Thus, New Zealand's line of succession remains identical to [[Succession to the British Throne|that of the United Kingdom]]. As such, the rules for succession are not fixed, but may be changed by a constitutional amendment; in December 2009, Prime Minister [[John Key]] expressed his support for proposed removal of male-preference primogeniture and anti-Catholic provisions in the succession laws. <small><ref name=succession>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=10612784|date=1 December 2009|title=NZ supports change to royal-succession rules|author=Audrey Young|publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]]}}</ref></small> The Constitution Act 1986 specifies that should a regent be installed in the United Kingdom, that individual will carry out the functions of the monarch of New Zealand. <small><ref>{{Harvnb| Elizabeth II| 1986| loc=4.1}}</ref></small>
[[File:Charles, Prince of Wales.jpg|thumb|left|[[Charles, Prince of Wales]], is the [[heir apparent]] to the New Zealand throne.]] . 

Upon a ''[[demise of the Crown]]'' (the death or abdication of a sovereign), the late sovereign's heir immediately and automatically succeeds, without any need for confirmation or further ceremony{{spaced ndash}}hence arises the phrase "[[The King is dead. Long live the King!]]." It is customary, though, for the accession of the new monarch to be publicly [[Proclamation|proclaimed]] by the Governor-General on behalf of the [[Executive Council of New Zealand]]. Following an appropriate period of [[mourning]], the monarch is also [[coronation of the British monarch|crowned]] in the United Kingdom in an ancient ritual, but one not necessary for a sovereign to reign. <small>{{#tag:ref|For example, [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] was never crowned, yet was undoubtedly king during his short time on the throne.|group=n|name=EdVIII1}}</small> Other than a transfer of all royal powers and functions to the new monarch from his or her predecessor, no other law or office is affected, as all references in legislation to previous monarchs, whether in the masculine (e.g. ''His Majesty'') or feminine (e.g. ''the Queen''), continue to mean the reigning sovereign of New Zealand. <small><ref name=EIIR35.1>{{Harvnb| Elizabeth II| 1986| loc=5.1-2}}</ref></small> After an individual ascends the throne, he or she typically continues to reign until death, being unable to unilaterally abdicate per the tenets of constitutional monarchy. <small>{{#tag:ref|The only New Zealand monarch to abdicate, Edward VIII, did so with the authorization of the New Zealand government granted in [[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936|His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act, 1936]].|group=n|name=EdVIII2}}</small> . 

===Title===. 
{{See|List of titles and honours of Queen Elizabeth II}}
One of the first post-Second World War examples of New Zealand's status as an independent monarchy was the alteration of the monarch's title by the [[Royal Titles Act 1953]]. For the first time, the official New Zealand title mentioned New Zealand separately from the United Kingdom and the other realms, to highlight the monarch's role specifically as Queen of New Zealand, as well as the shared aspect of the Crown throughout the realms; the title at that time was: ''"Elizabeth II, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Her Other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith"''. Since the passage of the [[Royal Titles Act 1974]], the monarch's title in New Zealand has been ''Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God Queen of New Zealand and Her Other Realms and Territories, [[Head of the Commonwealth]], [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]]''.  . 

Although the Queen's New Zealand title includes the phrase ''Defender of the Faith'', neither the Queen nor the Governor-General has any religious role in New Zealand; there has never been an [[established church]] in the country. This is one of the key differences from the Queen's role in England, where she is [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]].  . 

==Representation of the state==. 
As the living [[Metaphor|embodiment]] of [[the Crown]], the sovereign is regarded as the [[personification]], or [[legal person]]ality, of the New Zealand state,<small><ref name=Buck2 /></small> with the state therefore referred to as ''Her Majesty The Queen in Right of New Zealand'',<small>{{#tag:ref|For example, if a lawsuit is filed against the government, the respondent is formally described as ''Her Majesty the Queen in Queen in Right of New Zealand'', or simply ''[[Queen regnant|Regina]].|group=n|name=Pers2}}<ref>{{Citation| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom| title=Guarantee Eligibility Certificate| date=21 May 2004| page=1| place=Wellington| publisher=Queen's Printer for New Zealand| url=http://www.treasury.govt.nz/economy/guarantee/pdfs/wfec-bnz-2j.pdf| accessdate=16 May 2009}}</ref></small> or ''The Crown''. As such, the monarch is the employer of all government staff (including the viceroys, judges, members of the [[New Zealand Defence Force]], [[police]] officers, and [[Parliament of New Zealand|parliamentarians]]), the guardian of foster children (''[[Crown ward]]s''), as well as the owner of all state lands (''[[Crown land]]''), buildings and equipment (''Crown held property''), state owned companies (''[[Crown entity|Crown entities]]''),<small><ref>{{Harvnb| Cabinet Office| 2008| p=41}}</ref></small> and the [[copyright]] for all government publications (''[[Crown copyright]]''). This is all in his or her position as sovereign, and not as an individual; all such property is held by the Crown in perpetuity and cannot be sold by the sovereign without the proper advice and consent of his or her ministers.  . 

As the embodiment of the state, the monarch tops the [[New Zealand order of precedence]], and is also the locus of [[Oath of Allegiance (New Zealand)|oaths of allegiance]],<small><ref>{{Citation| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom| publication-date=24 Octiber 1957| title=Oaths and Declarations Act 1957| series=17| publication-place=Wellington| publisher=Queen's Printer for New Zealand| url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1957/0088/latest/DLM314553.html| accessdate=1 January 2010| ref=CITEREF_Elizabeth_II_1957}}</ref></small> required of many employees of the Crown,<small><ref>{{Harvnb| Elizabeth II| 1957| loc=22-25}}</ref></small> as well as by new [[citizenship|citizens]], as per the [[Oath of citizenship (New Zealand)|Oath of Citizenship]] laid out in the [[New Zealand nationality law|Citizenship Act]]. This is done in [[wikt:reciprocal|reciprocation]] to the sovereign's [[Coronation]] Oath, wherein he or she promises "to govern the Peoples of... New Zealand... according to their respective laws and customs."<small><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.oremus.org/liturgy/coronation/cor1953b.html| title=The Form and Order of Service that is to be performed and the Ceremonies that are to be observed in the Coronation of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in the Abbey Church of St. Peter, Westminster, on Tuesday, the second day of June 1953| publisher=Anglican Liturgical Library| accessdate=16 May 2009}}</ref></small> . 

==Constitutional role==. 
[[Constitution of New Zealand|New Zealand's constitution]] is made up of a variety of statutes and conventions that are either British or New Zealand in origin,<small><ref name=CO2 /></small> and together give New Zealand a [[parliamentary system]] of government wherein the role of the Queen is both legal and practical. The Crown is regarded as a [[corporation]], with the sovereign, in the position of [[head of state]],<small><ref name=EIIR2.1 /></small> as the centre of a construct in which the power of the whole is shared by multiple institutions of government acting under the sovereign's authority. <small><ref name=Murdoch>{{cite journal| last=Cox| first=Noel| title=Black v Chrétien: Suing a Minister of the Crown for Abuse of Power, Misfeasance in Public Office and Negligence| journal=Murdoch University Electronic Journal of Law| volume=9| issue=3| page=12| publisher=Murdoch University| location=Perth| date=September 2002| url=http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v9n3/cox93.html| accessdate=17 May 2009}}</ref></small> Though this power stems from [[People#In law|the people]], all New Zealanders live under the authority of the monarch.  . 

The vast powers that belong to the Crown are collectively known as the [[Royal Prerogative]],<small><ref name=CO8 /></small> the exercise of which does not require parliamentary approval, though it is not unlimited; for example, the monarch does not have the prerogative to impose and collect new taxes without the authorization of an [[Act of Parliament]]. The consent of the Crown must, however, be obtained before either of the houses of parliament may even debate a bill affecting the sovereign's prerogatives or interests, and no act of parliament binds the Queen or her rights unless the act states that it does.  . 

===Executive===. 
The [[government of New Zealand]] is defined by the constitution as the Queen acting on the advice of [[Executive Council of New Zealand|her Executive Council]]. <small><ref>{{Harvnb| Elizabeth II| 1986| loc=3A.1}}</ref></small> One of the main duties of the Crown is to ensure that a democratically elected government is always in place, which means appointing a [[prime minister]] to thereafter head the [[New Zealand Cabinet|Cabinet]]{{spaced ndash}}a committee of the Executive Council charged with [[Advice (constitutional)|advising]] the Crown on the exercise of the Royal Prerogative,<small><ref>{{Harvnb| Elizabeth II| 1983| loc=VII}}</ref></small> and legally required to keep the Governor-General up to date on state affairs. <small><ref name=CO9>{{Harvnb| Cabinet Office| 2008| p=9}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb| Elizabeth II| 1983| loc=XVI}}</ref></small> The Queen is informed by her viceroy of the swearing-in and resignation of prime ministers and other members of the [[Cabinet of New Zealand|ministry]], remains fully briefed through regular communications from her New Zealand ministers, and holds audience with them whenever possible. <small><ref name=Buck1 /></small>
[[File:NewZealandCabinet.jpg|thumb|right|The ministers of the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fifth Labour Government]] with then [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor-General]] Dame [[Silvia Cartwright]], 20 October 2005.]] . 

In the construct of [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[responsible government]], the ministerial advice tendered is typically binding, meaning the monarch ''reigns'' but does not ''rule''. However, the Royal Prerogative belongs to the Crown and not to any of the ministers,<small><ref name=Murdoch /></small> and the royal and viceroyal figures may unilaterally use these powers in exceptional [[constitutional crisis]] situations,<small><ref name=Murdoch /><ref name=CO9 /><ref name=GGRole>{{cite web| url=http://www.gg.govt.nz/role/index.htm| last=Office of the Governor-General of New Zealand| authorlink=Governor-General of New Zealand| title=Role & Functions > The Constitutional Role of the Head of State| publisher=Queen's Printer| accessdate=15 January 2010}}</ref></small> thereby allowing the monarch to make sure that the government conducts itself in compliance with the constitution. There are also a few duties which must be specifically performed by, or bills that require assent by, the Queen; these include applying the [[royal sign-manual]] and [[Seal of New Zealand]] to the appointment papers of governors-general, the confirmation of awards of [[Orders, decorations, and medals of New Zealand|New Zealand Royal Honours]],<small><ref>{{Harvnb| Cabinet Office| 2008| p=14}}</ref></small> and the approval of any change in her New Zealand title.  . 

====Foreign affairs====. 
The Royal Prerogative also extends to foreign affairs: the sovereign or the Governor-General negotiates and ratifies treaties, alliances, and international agreements, on the advice of the Cabinet. The Governor-General, on behalf of the Queen, also accredits New Zealand High Commissioners and ambassadors, and receives similar diplomats from foreign states. In 2005, the [[Letter of credence|Letters of Credence and Recall]] were altered so as to run in the name of the incumbent Governor-General, instead of following the usual international process of the letters being from one head of state to another. In addition, the issuance of passports falls under the Royal Prerogative, and, as such, all [[New Zealand passport]]s are issued in the monarch's name and remain her property.  . 

===Parliament===. 
The sovereign is one of the two components of [[Parliament of New Zealand|parliament]],<small><ref name=GGRole /></small> but the monarch and viceroy do not participate in the legislative process save for the granting of [[Royal Assent]], which is necessary for a bill to be enacted as law; either figure or a delegate may perform this task, and the viceroy has the option of deferring assent to the sovereign. The Crown is further responsible for summoning, [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|proroguing]], and [[dissolution of Parliament|dissolving]] the House of Representatives,<small><ref>{{Harvnb| Cabinet Office| 2008| p=75}}</ref></small> after which the Governor-General usually [[Writ of election|calls for a general election]]. The new parliamentary session is marked by either the monarch or the Governor-General reading the [[Speech from the Throne]];<small><ref>{{Harvnb| Cabinet Office| 2008| p=87}}</ref></small> as the both are traditionally barred from the House of Representatives, this ceremony, as well as the bestowing of Royal Assent, takes place in the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council Chamber]]; the monarch has formally opened parliament on five occasions: January 1954, February 1963, March 1970, February 1986, and February 1990. <small><ref>New Zealand Official Year Book 1990</ref></small> Despite the sovereign's exclusion, Members of Parliament must still express their loyalty to her and defer to her authority, as the Oath of Allegiance must be recited by all new parliamentarians before they may take their seat, and the [[Official Opposition (Canada)|official opposition]] is traditionally dubbed as ''[[Loyal opposition|Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition]]''.  . 

===Courts===. 
The sovereign is responsible for rendering justice for all her subjects, and is thus traditionally deemed the ''fount of justice''. However, she does not personally rule in judicial cases; instead the judicial functions of the Royal Prerogative are performed in trust and in the Queen's name by Officers of Her Majesty's Court. The monarch is immune from criminal prosecution, the notion in common law being that the sovereign "can do no wrong"; the monarch cannot be prosecuted in her own courts for criminal offences. Civil lawsuits against the Crown in its public capacity (that is, lawsuits against the Queen-in-Council) are permitted; however, lawsuits against the monarch personally are not cognizable. The monarch, and by extension the Governor-General, also grants immunity from prosecution, exercises the ''[[Pardon#Canada|Royal Prerogative of Mercy]]'',<small><ref name=CO8 /></small> and may pardon offences against the Crown, either before, during, or after a trial.  . 

As the judges and courts are the sovereign's judges and courts, and as all law in New Zealand derives from the Crown, the monarch stands to give legitimacy to courts of justice, and is the source of their judicial authority. The [[Coat of Arms of New Zealand|Arms of Her Majesty in Right of New Zealand]] is always displayed in New Zealand courtrooms.  . 

===The Crown and the New Zealand Defence Force===. 
[[File:HM King George VI visits No 617 Sqn RAF.jpg|thumb|right|[[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] speaks with a [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] Flight Lieutenant at [[RAF Scampton]], 27 May 1943.]]

The Crown also sits at the pinnacle of the [[New Zealand Defence Force]].

One particular area of note is that the country's only currently ranked [[Admiral of the Fleet]] is [[Prince Philip]], the Queen's consort. This title is held in conjunction with those of [[Field Marshal]] and [[Marshal of the Royal New Zealand Air Force]].  . 

===The Crown and Māori===. 
Māori interaction with the Crown dates back to 1832, when [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]] in his [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|British Council]] appointed [[James Busby]] as [[Resident (title)|Resident]], to address concerns on the part of Māori in the [[Bay of Islands]] over expanding European settlements in that area. On 28 October 1835, Busby oversaw a ''hui'' (forum) held at Waitangi, at which a flag was selected for New Zealand and a [[Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand|declaration of independence]] written by Busby was signed by 36 Māori chiefs; both were acknowledged the following year by the King in a letter from [[Charles Grant, 1st Baron Glenelg|Lord Glenelg]]. <small><ref>{{Citation| last=The Lord Glenelg| author-link=Charles Grant, 1st Baron Glenelg| date=25 May 1836| contribution=EXTRACT of a DESPATCH from Lord GLENELG to Major-General Sir RICHARD BOURKE, New South Wales| title=Documents > Declaration of Independence| place=London| publication-place=Christchurch| publisher=Waitangi Associates| url=http://www.waitangi.co.nz/declarationindependence.htm#Extract| accessdate=11 January 2010}}</ref></small> . 

As a result the declaration's ratification by the House of Commons in 1836, officials in the Colonial Office determined in 1839 that a treaty of cessation would need to be signed with Māori for the British Crown to acquire sovereignty over New Zealand. <small><ref>{{cite book |last=Orange |first=Claudia |title=An Ilustrated History of the Treaty of Waitangi |year=2004 |publisher=Bridget Williams Books |location=Wellington |isbn=1-877242-16-0 |page=42}}</ref></small> The [[Treaty of Waitangi]] was signed in 1840 by representatives of the British Crown and over 500 Māori chiefs, and is considered the [[founding document]] of the nation. <small><ref>{{Harvnb| Cabinet Office| 2008| p=1}}</ref></small> The Treaty identifies the Crown's right to [[Kawanatanga]] or Governorship, leading one Maori academic to argue that Kawanatanga, or the New Zealand Government, is party to the Treaty. <small><ref>{{Citation| last=Jackson| first=Moana| author-link=Moana Jackson| publication-date=1996| editor-last=Trainor| editor-first=Luke| title=Republicanism in New Zealand| page=119| publication-place=Palmerston North| publisher=Dunmore Press| isbn=978-0864692566}}</ref></small> . 

Since the treaty's implementation, a number of petitions have been made by Māori directly to the sovereign in [[London]], whom they felt they had a [[Special Relationship|special relationship]], the first coming from northern chiefs in 1852. This and all subsequent appeals were directed back to the sovereign's New Zealand ministers for advice on how to proceed. <small><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/node/2150| last=History Group of the New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage| title=Politics and government > Maori leadership > Maori King movement - 1860-94 > Normalising relations| publisher=Queen's Printer for New Zealand| accessdate=2 January 2010}}</ref></small> The results were not always favorable to Māori, who have communicated their discontent to the monarch or other royals; in response to a refusal by the Executive Council in 1981 to allow [[Mana Motuhake]] direct access to Queen Elizabeth II, Māori activist [[Dun Mihaka]] offered a traditional rebuke by baring his buttocks at Prince Charles and Princess Diana. In a later incident Mihaka attempted to crash into the Queen's motorcade; he was intercepted by Police before this happened. <small><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1866667_1866668_1866592,00.html|title=Top 10 Odd Protests - Down (Under) And Dirty|accessdate=8 January 2010|date=15 December 2008|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref></small> . 

In the [[Māori language]], the Queen is sometimes referred to as ''Te kōtuku-rerenga-tahi'', meaning "the [[Great Egret|white heron]] of a single flight"; in Māori proverb, the rare white heron is a significant bird seen only once in a lifetime. <small><ref name=Buck2 /></small> In 1953, for her [[Coronation]], Queen Elizabeth II was given a kiwi feather ''[[Korowai]]'', or cloak,<small><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/NewZealand/Symbolsandceremonies.aspx| last=Royal Household| title=The Queen and the Commonwealth > Queen and New Zealand > Symbols and ceremonies| publisher=Queen's Printer| accessdate=2 January 2010}}</ref></small> which she wears when attending a ''[[pōwhiri]]'', or Māori welcoming ceremony, also speaking partly in Māori. <small><ref name=NZRV>{{cite web| url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/NewZealand/Royalvisits.aspx| last=Royal Household| title=The Queen and the Commonwealth > Queen and New Zealand > Royal visits| publisher=Queen's Printer| accessdate=2 January 2010}}</ref></small> . 

===Cook Islands, Niue, and the territories===. 
{{See|Monarchy of the Cook Islands}}
The sovereign of New Zealand also serves as the monarch of the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]], territories in [[Associated state|free association]] with New Zealand within the larger [[Realm of New Zealand]]. <small><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ck/govt.htm#hea| title=Government of the Cook Islands| publisher=Jarvy Web| accessdate=2 January 2010}}</ref><ref name=UVWLR>{{Cite journal| last=Townend| first=Andrew| title=The Strange Death of the Realm of New Zealand: The Implications of a New Zealand Republic for the Cook Islands and Niue| journal=Victoria University of Wellington Law Review| issue=34| publisher=Victoria University of Wellington| location=Wellington| year=2003| url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/nz/journals/VUWLRev/2003/34.html#Heading16| accessdate=2 January 2010}}</ref></small> The New Zealand monarchy, however, is unitary throughout all jurisdictions in the country, with the [[Head of state|headship of state]] being a part of all equally. As such, the sovereignty of the Cook Islands and Niue is passed on not by the Governor-General or parliament of New Zealand, but through the overreaching Crown itself as a part of the executive, legislative, and judicial operations in all three areas. Though singular, linking the governments of New Zealand, Niue, and the Cook Islands, the Crown is thus "divided" into three legal jurisdictions.  . 

The [[Queen's Representative]] serves as the viceroy of the Cook Islands and the Governor-General of New Zealand,<small><ref>{{Citation| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom| publication-date=1981| title=Constitution of the Cook Islands| series=3.1| publication-place=Avarua| publisher=Queen's Printer for the Cook Islands| url=http://www.paclii.org/cgi-paclii/disp.pl/ck/legis/num_act/cotci327/cotci327.html?query=cotci327| accessdate=2 January 2010}}</ref></small> represented by the State Services Commissioner,<small><ref>{{Citation| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom| publication-date=30 March 1988| title=State Sector Act 1988| series=3| publication-place=Wellington| publisher=Queen's Printer for New Zealand| url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1988/0020/latest/whole.html?search=ts_act_Niue+Constitution+Act_resel&p=1#dlm129110| accessdate=2 January 2010}}</ref></small> represents the Queen in Niue,<small><ref name=UVWLR /><ref>{{Citation| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom| publication-date=29 August 1974| title=Niue Constitution Act 1974| series=Schedule 2.I.1| publication-place=Wellington| publisher=Queen's Printer for New Zealand| url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1974/0042/latest/whole.html?search=ts_act_Niue+Constitution+Act_resel&p=1#DLM412787| accessdate=2 January 2010}}</ref></small> carrying out all the monarch's constitutional and ceremonial duties of state on her behalf.

==Cultural role==. 
===Royal presence and duties===. 
{{See|List of Commonwealth visits made by Queen Elizabeth II}}
Members of the Royal Family have been present in New Zealand since the late 1800s, their reasons including participating in military manoeuvres, serving as viceroy, or undertaking official royal tours. Usually important milestones, anniversaries, or celebrations of [[Culture of New Zealand|New Zealand culture]] will warrant the presence of the monarch, while other royals will be asked to participate in lesser occasions. ''Official duties'' involve the sovereign representing the New Zealand state at home or abroad, or her relations as members of the Royal Family participating in government organized ceremonies either in New Zealand or elsewhere. <small>{{#tag:ref|Though the Royal Family represents other countries abroad, as directed by their respective cabinets, and typically the Governor-General will undertake [[state visit]]s and other foreign duties on behalf of the Queen of New Zealand,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gg.govt.nz/role/functions.htm| last=Office of the Governor-General of New Zealand| authorlink=Governor-General of New Zealand| title=Role & Functions " The Governor-General’s Three Roles| publisher=Queen's Printer| accessdate=15 January 2010}}</ref> members of the Royal Family will also take part in New Zealand events overseas. For example, on 11 November 2006, Queen Elizabeth II{{spaced ndash}}accompanied by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; Prince Charles, Prince of Wales; [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|The Duchess of Cornwall]]; Prince William; [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]]; and Princess Anne, Princess Royal{{spaced ndash}}dedicated the New Zealand war memorial in [[London]]'s [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], reviewing a royal [[Honor guard|Guard of Honour]] formed by the largest contingent of New Zealand forces seen in the UK since Her Majesty's Coronation in 1953. <ref>{{Cite news| title=Queen honours New Zealand's dead| publisher=BBC| date=11 November 2006| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6139656.stm| accessdate=17 November 2006}}</ref>|group=n|name=Duties}}</small> The advice of the New Zealand Cabinet is the impetus for royal participation in any New Zealand event. Such events have included centennials and bicentennials; [[Waitangi Day]]; the openings of [[Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth]] and other games; anniversaries of Māori treaty signings; awards ceremonies; [[Normandy Landings|D-Day]] commemorations; anniversaries of the monarch's accession; and the like. Conversely, ''unofficial duties'' are performed by Royal Family members on behalf of New Zealand organizations of which they may be [[Patronage|patrons]], through their attendance at charity events, visiting with members of the New Zealand Defence Force as Colonel-in-Chief, or marking certain key anniversaries. The invitation and expenses associated with these undertakings are usually borne by the associated organization.  . 

Since 1869, when [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Alfred]], one of Queen Victoria's sons arrived on New Zealand's shores, more than fifty tours of New Zealand by a member of the Royal Family have taken place, though only five of those occurred before 1953. After Alfred came [[George V of the United Kingdom|The Duke]] and [[Mary of Teck|Duchess of Cornwall and York]] (later King George V and Queen Mary) in 1901; [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince Edward, Prince of Wales]] (later King Edward VIII), in 1920; [[George VI of the United Kingdom|The Duke]] and [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Duchess of York]] (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth) in 1927; and [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]], from 1934 to 1935. Queen Elizabeth II was the first reigning monarch of New Zealand to tour the country, becoming such when she arrived during her 1953-1954 global tour; she broadcast from Government House in [[Auckland]] her annual [[Royal Christmas Message]].  . 

Queen Elizabeth also toured New Zealand on a number of other occasions: between 6 and 18 February 1963, she attended celebrations at [[Waitangi, Northland|Waitangi]] and the [[Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council]] was founded as the nation's gift to the monarch; from 12 to 30 March 1970, the Queen, accompanied by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]], participated in the [[James Cook]] bicentenary celebrations; between 30 January and 8 February 1974, and she attended and closed [[1974 British Commonwealth Games|that year's Commonwealth Games]] in [[Christchurch]] and participated in [[Waitangi Day|New Zealand Day]] events at Waitangi. As part of a Commonwealth-wide tour for [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|her Silver Jubilee]], Elizabeth was in New Zealand from 22 February to 7 March 1977; she made a brief visit, between 12 and 20 October, following a [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] (CHOGM) in [[Melbourne]]; marked the centennial of the [[New Zealand Police]] during a tour from 22 February to 2 March 1986; the Queen closed the [[1990 Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games]] in Auckland and, with her son, [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]], took part in events marking the sesquicentennial of the Treaty of Waitangi between 1 and 16 February 1990; between 1 and 10 November 1995, she attended the CHOGM in Auckland and opened the newly refurbished parliament buildings; and, as part of her global tour for [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|her Golden Jubilee]], Elizabeth was in New Zealand from 22 to 27 February 2002. <small><ref>{{cite web| last=The Department of Internal Affairs| authorlink=Department of Internal Affairs (New Zealand)| title=Visits to New Zealand by The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh| publisher=Queen's Printer}}</ref></small> .

References to the monarchy are commonplace in public life in New Zealand. Her portrait is often found in [[Government Buildings|government buildings]], [[military installation]]s, and schools. There are references to [[St Edward's Crown]], on the [[Coat of Arms of New Zealand|New Zealand's Royal Coat of Arms]], on various medals, and awards.  . 

These latter cases reflect the monarch's place as the ceremonial head of the [[New Zealand honours system]]. As such, only she can approve the creation of an [[honour]], which she does as requested by the government of New Zealand. Although, the Governor-General administers most responsibilities relating to New Zealand honours on the Queen's behalf.  . 

The use of the term 'Royal', as in the [[Royal New Zealand Navy]] and [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]], and oaths taken by politicians, judges, members of the armed forces and new citizens are to the Queen. The Queen's portrait appears on some [[postage stamp]]s, the obverse (front) of [[New Zealand dollar|New Zealand coins]], and all banknotes feature the portrait of the Queen as the watermark. However, only the $20 banknote bears her image as the main feature.  . 

In New Zealand, unlike in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Queen's Birthday|Queen's Official Birthday]] is a [[Holiday|public holiday]] and is celebrated in the first Monday in June. Republican Movement surveys conducted in 2009 and 2010 showed there had been no official civic celebrations or plans to celebrate the Queen's birthday on the day, apart from the Queen's Birthday Honours list. <ref name="rudman">{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/opinion/news/article.cfm?c_id=466&objectid=10650210&pnum=0|title=Clear signal from Her at the Palace|author=[[Brian Rudman]]|publisher=[[New Zealand Herald]]}}</ref> . 

[[God Save the Queen]] remains one of the [[National Anthems]], along with [[God Defend New Zealand]] but has been generally restricted to Official occasions where the Monarch or the Vice-Regal representative, the Governor General, are being either honoured or in attendance for a particular purpose.  . 

==History==. 
Monarchy in New Zealand dates back to the first half of the nineteenth century.  . 

After [[Captain Cook]]'s exploration of New Zealand in the late eighteenth century, an increasing number of European settlers came to New Zealand. In 1833, with growing lawlessness amongst traders and settlers, the [[British government]] appointed [[James Busby]] as [[British Resident]] to protect British trading interests.  . 

Despite Busby's presence, trouble increased. In 1840, the British Government sent [[Captain William Hobson]] to New Zealand as [[Lieutenant Governor]], to acquire the [[sovereignty]] of New Zealand, by way of a treaty with the native [[Māori people|Māori]] chiefs.  . 

The [[Treaty of Waitangi]] was signed on 6 February 1840, at [[Waitangi, Northland|Waitangi]] in the [[Bay of Islands]]. Over five hundred Māori chiefs signed the treaty as it was taken around the country during the next eight months.  . 

Following the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, the islands of New Zealand became a [[British colony]].  . 

In 1907, New Zealand achieved the status of [[Dominion]], which meant it was a country of the [[British Empire]] and later the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], with autonomy in domestic and foreign affairs. The term fell into disuse after the [[Second World War]].  . 

In 1917, letters patent of [[George V]] set out the powers, duties and responsibilities of the Governor-General (as the Sovereign's representative) and the Executive Council.  . 

In 1926, the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926|Balfour Declaration]] at the Imperial Conference in London confirmed the status of New Zealand, along with that of [[Australia]], the [[Irish Free State]], [[Canada]], [[South Africa]] and [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], as self-governing Dominions under the [[British Crown]].  . 

The [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster in 1931]], an act of the British Parliament, gave legal form to this declaration. It gave New Zealand and other Dominions the authority to make their own laws. New Zealand ratified the Statute in 1947, after the passing of the [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947]]

The Royal Titles Act 1953 first introduced a New Zealand royal title for use by the Queen, and the Royal Titles Act 1974 altering the style borne by the Queen in New Zealand.

A [[Queen's Personal New Zealand Flag|personal flag]] for use by the Queen in New Zealand was adopted in 1962. It features the shield design of the [[Coat of arms of New Zealand|New Zealand coat of arms]] in the form of an oblong or square. Superimposed in the centre is a dark blue roundel bearing an initial E surmounted by a Royal crown within a gold chaplet of roses.  . 

More recently, the [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1986|Constitution Act 1986]] has become the principal formal statement of New Zealand's constitution. This Act recognises that the Queen, the Sovereign in right of New Zealand, is the Head of State of New Zealand and that the Governor-General appointed by her is her representative. Each can, in general, exercise all the powers of the other. However the appointment of the governor-general is only done by the Queen, on the advice of the Prime Minister.  . 

==Debate==. 
There is less agitation for ending the monarchy of New Zealand and creating a [[Republicanism in New Zealand|New Zealand republic]] than in neighbouring [[Australia]], where [[Republicanism in Australia|Australian republicanism]] is stronger. Supporters of the monarchy claim that for New Zealand, "...monarchy summarises the inheritance of a thousand years of constitutional government and our links with a glorious past,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/mar/09/monarchy.tobymanhire|title=What the New Zealand press said about ......

Neither [[New Zealand National Party|National]] or [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]], the two major [[Political parties in New Zealand|political parties]] currently in parliament have a stated policy of creating a republic, although [[Peter Dunne]]'s [[United Future]] does and some Members of Parliament have publicly expressed their personal support for a republic. In contrast, some members have also expressed support for the monarchy. Former Deputy Prime Minister [[Michael Cullen (politician)|Michael Cullen]] declared that he supported the monarchy, stating in 2004 he was "a sort of token monarchist in the Cabinet these days."<small><ref name="quotecullen">{{cite book|publisher=Clerk of the House of Representatives| title= Daily Hansard: Clerk of the House of Representatives|date=16 December 2004}}</ref></small> However, in 2010 he repudiated that stance, taking the view that New Zealand should move towards a republic once the Queen's reign ends. <small><ref name="cullen_2">{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10669598|title=Cullen: New Zealand should be republic|publisher=[[Herald on Sunday]]|date=29 August 2010|accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref></small> Presently, Prime Minister John Key has said he is "not convinced [a republic] will be a big issue in the short term,"<small><ref>{{Cite news| title=Strong backing for MMP referendum| publisher=TVNZ| date=23 June 2008| url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/1866364| accessdate=13 July 2008}}</ref></small> but does believe that a republic is "inevitable."<small><ref name=johnkey2>{{Citation| last=Smith| first=Peter| title=Key knocking on door of government| newspaper=Financial Times| date=1 September 2008| url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4cc53226-77bc-11dd-be24-0000779fd18c.html?nclick_check=1| accessdate=4 September 2008}}</ref></small> There are two special-interest groups representing both sides of the debate in New Zealand, and argue the issue in the media from time to time: the [[Monarchy New Zealand]] and the [[Republican Movement of Aotearoa New Zealand]].  .
