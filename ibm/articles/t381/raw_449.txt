{{Monarchism |expanded=all}} . 

'''Monarchism''' is the advocacy of the establishment, preservation, or restoration of a [[monarchy]] as a [[form of government]] in a nation.  A '''monarchist''' is an individual who supports this form of government out of principle, independent from the person, the [[monarch]].  . 

In this system, the Monarch may be the person who sits on the throne, a [[pretender]], or someone who would otherwise inhabit the throne but has been deposed.  . 

In 1687-88, the [[Glorious Revolution]] and the overthrow of King [[James II of England|James II]] established the principles of [[constitutional monarchy]], which would later be worked out by [[Montesquieu]] and other thinkers. However, [[absolute monarchy]], theorized by [[Hobbes]] in the ''[[Leviathan (book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651), remained a dominant principle. In the 18th century, [[Voltaire]] and others encouraged "[[enlightened absolutism]]", which was embraced by the [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II]] and [[Catherine II of Russia]].  . 

[[Absolute monarchy|Absolutism]] continued to be the dominant political principle of [[sovereignty]] until the 1789 [[French Revolution]] and the [[regicide]] against [[Louis XVI]], which established the concept of [[popular sovereignty]] upheld by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. [[Monarchy]] began to be contested by the [[Republicanism|Republican principe]]. [[Counterrevolutionaries]], such as [[Joseph de Maistre]] or [[Louis de Bonald]], sought the restoration of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'', divided in the three [[estates of the realm]], and the [[Divine Right of Kings|divine right of kings]].  . 

Following the ousting of [[Napoleon I]] in 1814, the Coalition [[Bourbon Restoration|restored the Bourbon Dynasty]] in pushing [[Louis XVIII]] to the French throne. The ensuing period, called the [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]], was characterized by a sharp [[Conservatism|conservative]] reaction and the re-establishment of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], supported by the [[ultramontanism]] movement, as a power in [[France|French]] politics. After the 1830 [[July Revolution]] and the overthrow of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]], the [[legitimist]] branch was defeated and the [[Orleanist]]s, gathered behind [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]], accepted the principle of [[constitutional monarchy]].  . 

The [[Revolutions of 1848|Spring of Nations]] in 1848 then set the signal for a new wave of [[revolution]]s against the [[Europe]]an monarchies.  . 

[[World War I]] and its aftermath saw the end of three major European monarchies, the Russian [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] dynasty, the German [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] dynasty and the Austro-Hungarian [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] dynasty. In [[History of Russia|Russia]], the [[February Revolution|1917 February revolution]] resulted in the [[abdication]] of [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and the establishment of [[Soviet Union|Bolshevik Russia]] and a [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] between the Bolshevik [[Red Army]] and the monarchist [[White Army]] from 1917 to 1921.  . 

The rise of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] in 1919 saw an increase in support for monarchism, however efforts by Hungarian monarchists failed to bring back a royal head of state, and the monarchists settled for a [[regent]], Admiral [[Miklós Horthy]], to represent the monarchy until it could be restored. Horthy was regent from 1920 to 1944. In [[Germany]] a number of monarchists gathered around the [[German National People's Party]] which demanded the return of the [[Hohenzollern]] monarchy and an end to the [[Weimar Republic]]. The party retained a large base of support until the rise of [[Nazism]] in the 1930s.  . 

With the arrival of [[Communism]] in [[Eastern Europe]] by 1945, the remaining Eastern European monarchies such as the [[Kingdom of Romania]], the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] and the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] were all abolished and replaced by [[socialist republics]].  . 

The aftermath of [[World War II]] also saw the return of monarchist and republican rivalry in [[Italy]], in which a referendum was held on whether Italy should remain a monarchy or become a republic. The republican side won the referendum (by a narrow margin) and the modern Republic of Italy was created.  . 

Monarchism as a political force internationally has substantially diminished since the end of the Second World War, though it had an important role in the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]] and also played a role in the modern political affairs of [[Nepal]].  Nepal was one of the last states to have had an absolute monarch, which continued until King [[Gyanendra of Nepal]] was peacefully deposed in May 2008 and Nepal became a federal republic.  One of the world's oldest monarchies was abolished in [[Ethiopia]] in 1974 with the fall of Emperor [[Haile Selassie]].  . 

== Constitutional monarchies ==. 
{{Main|Constitutional monarchy}} . 

Constitutional monarchies form the majority of the current monarchies. Since the middle of the 19th century, some monarchists have stopped defending monarchy on the basis of abstract, universal principles applicable to all nations, or even on the grounds that a monarchy would be the best or most practical [[government]] for the nation in question, but on local symbolic grounds that they would be a particular nation's link to the past.  . 

The [[International Monarchist League]], founded in 1943, which has been very influential in Canada and Australia, has always sought to promote monarchy on the grounds that it strengthens popular liberty, both in a democracy and in a dictatorship, because by definition the monarch is not beholden to politicians.  . 

Hence, post-19th century debates on whether to preserve a [[monarchy]] or to adopt a [[Republicanism|republican]] form of government have often been debates over national identity, with the [[monarch]] generally serving as a symbol for other issues.  . 

For example, in countries like [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] anti-monarchist talk is often centered around the perceived symbolism of a monarch contrasting with those nation's political culture of [[egalitarianism]]. In [[Belgium]], another factor are the anti-Belgian sentiments of the separatist [[Flemish movement]].  . 

In [[Canada]] and [[Australia]], by contrast, debates over monarchy represent or represented debates whose driving force concerned each nation's relationship with the [[United Kingdom]] and the cultural heritage that that represents. In a nation like [[Saudi Arabia]], finally, opposition to the monarchy may be synonmous with advocacy of [[democracy]] or [[Islamic fundamentalism]]. As monarchies take many different forms, so too do pro- and anti-monarchy debates.  . 

[[Otto von Habsburg]] advocated a form of constitutional monarchy based on the primacy of the supreme judicial function, with hereditary succession. [[Mediation]] by a [[tribunal]] is warranted if suitability is problematic.&nbsp;[http://home1.gte.net/eskandar/ottohabsburg.html].  .
