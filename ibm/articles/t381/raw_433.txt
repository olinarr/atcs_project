The '''royal prerogative''' is a body of customary authority, privilege, and immunity, recognized in [[common law]] and, sometimes, in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions possessing a monarchy as belonging to the [[sovereign]] alone. <ref>In [[Commonwealth]] realms, the wording ''[[the crown]]'' is usually used in this context instead of ''king'' or ''queen''</ref> It is the means by which some of the [[executive (government)|executive]] powers of government, possessed by and vested in a monarch with regard to the process of governance of their state, are carried out. Individual prerogatives can be abolished by Parliament, although in the United Kingdom special procedure applies.  . 

Though some [[republic]]an heads of state possess similar powers, they are not coterminous, containing a number of fundamental differences, and may be either more or less extensive (cf. [[reserve power]]s).  . 

In England, while prerogative powers were originally exercised by the monarch acting alone, without an observed requirement for  [[Parliament of England|parliament]]ary consent (after [[Magna Carta]]), since the accession of the [[George I of Great Britain|House of Hanover]] they have been generally exercised on the advice of the  [[Prime Minister]] or the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]], who in turn is accountable to Parliament, exclusively so, except in matters of the Royal Family, since at least the time of [[Queen Victoria]].  . 

Typically in [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] that are [[constitutional monarchies]], such as those of [[List of Danish monarchs|Denmark]], [[Emperor of Japan|Japan]] or [[King of Sweden|Sweden]], the royal prerogative serves as a prescribed ceremonial function of the [[nation state|state power]].  . 

==Definition==. 
In the [[Kingdom of England]] (up to 1707), the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] (1707–1800) and the [[United Kingdom]] (since 1801), the royal prerogative historically was one of the central features of the [[realm]]'s governance.  . 

Constitutional theorist [[AV Dicey]] gives the standard definition of what prerogative powers are: . 

{{quote|... the remaining portion of the Crown's original authority, and it is therefore ... the name for the residue of discretionary power left at any moment in the hands of the Crown, whether such power be in fact exercised by the King himself or by his Ministers. <ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmpubadm/422/42204.htm House of Commons – Public Administration – Fourth Report<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>}} . 

The scope of the royal prerogative is difficult to determine. It is clear that the existence and extent of the power is a matter of common law, making the courts the final arbiter of whether or not a particular type of prerogative exists.  . 

==Ministerial exercise of  the monarch's prerogatives==. 
Today, some prerogatives are directly exercised by ministers without the approval of Parliament, including, in the United Kingdom, the powers to regulate the civil service, issue passports and grant honours. <ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/public_administration_select_committee/pasc_19.cfm UK Parliament – PASC 19<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Some prerogative powers are exercised nominally by the monarch, but on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], with whom the monarch meets weekly, and on the advice of [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom]]. Some{{which?|date=February 2011}} key areas of the British system of government are still carried out by means of the royal prerogative, but its usage has been diminishing as functions are progressively made statutory.  . 

Contrary to widespread belief, the royal prerogative is not constitutionally unlimited. While the sovereign has the right to promulgate (i.e., create and proclaim) new law, it is a form of reserve power not constitutionally used. (Her Majesty, as Head of State of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms, has the right to use the royal prerogative over any nation where she is Head of State.) . 

In the [[Case of Proclamations]] (1611) during the reign of King [[James I of England|James I/VI]], English common law courts judges emphatically asserted that they possessed the right to determine the limits of the royal prerogative. Since the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688), which brought co-monarchs Queen [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] and King [[William III of England|William III]] to power; this interpretation of there being a separate and distinct power of the Judiciary has not been challenged by [[the Crown]].  It has been accepted that it is emphatically the province of the Court(s) to say what the law is, or means.  This is a crucial corollary and foundation to the concept of the Judicial Power; and its distinct and separate nature from the Executive Power possessed by the Crown itself, or its Ministers.  .

===United Kingdom===.

===Canada===. 
In Canada, for the most part, the royal prerogative is the same as that in the United Kingdom, as constrained by constitutional convention,<ref>{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year= 2010 |title= British and Canadian Experience with the royal prerogative |journal= Canadian Parliamentary Review |volume= |issue= Summer 2010 |pages= 18–24 |publisher= Parliament of Canada |doi= |url= http://www2.parl.gc.ca/sites/lop/infoparl/33/2/33n2_10e_Hicks.pdf |accessdate= 2011-04-18}}</ref> although its exercise is through the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] or the [[Lieutenant governor (Canada)|lieutenant governor]]s of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]]. The royal prerogative in Canada is largely set out in Part III of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'', particularly section 9. <ref>[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-2.html#anchorbo-ga:s_9 Canada Department of Justice, ''Constitution Acts, 1867 to 1982'']</ref><ref name="Law Times">{{cite news |title= War power and the royal prerogative |publisher=Law Times |date=2006-05-01 |url=http://www.lawtimesnews.com/20060501549/Headline-News/War-power-and-the-Royal-Prerogative |accessdate=2011-04-18}}</ref> Other sections, such as 15, sets out the royal prerogative in relation to the [[Canadian Forces|armed forces]]. <ref name="Law Times"/> The royal prerogative in Canada even extends to the granting of honours, as explained by the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] in [[Black v. Chrétien]] (regarding [[Conrad Black]]'s entitlement to an appointment to the [[House of Lords]] while a Canadian citizen). <ref name="Law Times"/> Other royal prerogatives, such as the prerogative of mercy, also carry over into the Canadian context. <ref>{{cite web|author=Cloverdale ARPA |url=http://arpacanada.ca/index.php/issuesresearch/pro-life/81-latimers-appeal-for-the-royal-prerogative-of-mercy |title=Latimer's Appeal for the royal prerogative of Mercy |publisher=ARPA Canada |date= |accessdate=2011-04-18}}</ref> . 

The power to issue passports also remains under the royal prerogative in Canada. The terms for the issuing of passports by the Minister of Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Crown are set out in the ''Canadian Passport Order'',<ref>''Canadian Passport Order'', SI/81-86. </ref> issued by the Governor-in-Council under the royal prerogative.  The [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]] has used the royal prerogative on one occasion to deny passports to a Canadian citizen whom the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] held, and released, from the American prison in the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] base at [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]]. <ref>''[http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/en/2006/2006fc727/2006fc727.html Khadr v. Canada (Attorney General)]'', 2006 FC 727, para. 12. </ref> [[Abdurahman Khadr]] was denied a passport by the Canadian government.  The Federal Court of Canada on judicial review quashed the Minister's refusal of a passport and ordered that the application be re-considered. <ref>''[http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/en/2006/2006fc727/2006fc727.html Khadr v. Canada (Attorney General)]'', 2006 FC 727, para. 134. </ref> . 

===Other Commonwealth realms===. 
In the other [[Commonwealth realms]], the royal prerogative varies significantly from the prerogative in the United Kingdom, and is exercised by the Monarch's representative, the [[Governor-General]]. The [[Constitution]] of a Commonwealth realm may sharply limit the prerogative in ways that do not apply in the United Kingdom and many governmental acts which would be done under the prerogative in the United Kingdom are given effect by the Constitution or Acts of Parliament in a Commonwealth realm.  . 

===British dependencies===. 
Generally, [[The Crown|the Crown]] retains all the power of the state in a Crown colony (even if in practice it is not directly exercised), which was later renamed ‘dependent territory’ in 1983 and has been known as ‘overseas territory’ since 2002.  Thus the royal prerogative is in theory an unlimited, arbitrary authority. <ref>[[Campbell v. Hall]], 1774</ref>  In [[British overseas territories]] however, each inhabited territory has a constitution by which the territory is governed locally.  . 

The absoluteness of the royal prerogative in the colonies was however defeated in the case of ''[[Campbell v. Hall]]'' in 1774. This case decided that once a colony gained a representative assembly (or once the governor has been instructed to call one), the royal authority is limited to the familiar prerogatives; without the assembly's consent the Crown could not raise taxation nor change the law. Several of the colonies of the British West Indies thus became "settled colonies", and reverted to "crown colony" status only by Act of Parliament in the nineteenth century. <ref>e.g. The St. Vincent and Grenada Constitution Act 1876 (39 & 40 Vict. c. 47)</ref> . 

In August 2009 the government of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], a UK dependency, was revested in the [[Governor#British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations|governor]], on the advice of the [[Government of the United Kingdom]], under an [[Order in Council]]<ref>The Turks and Caicos Islands Constitution (Interim Amendment) Order 2009</ref> of 18 March 2009, which suspended and amended parts of the Islands' constitution, and vacated all the offices of [[Government minister|ministers]] and the House of Assembly. This was not itself an exercise of the royal prerogative, as it was made under "the West Indies Act 1962 and of all other powers enabling Her to do so". However, in effect the order extended the royal prerogative in the Islands, vesting wide discretionary legislative and executive powers in [[Majesty|Her Majesty]]'s governor. The governor remains subject to the amended constitution, and in practice to the instructions of [[Queen regent|the Queen]]'s [[Foreign Office]] in the UK.  . 

In the case of the [[Chagos Archipelago]], in 2000, the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales]] ruled that a local ordinance made by the Commissioner of the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] exiling the islanders was unlawful, a decision which was accepted by the British [[Foreign Secretary]] [[Robin Cook]]. That Order was legislation passed under authority given by the royal prerogative, not an exercise of the prerogative itself, and was overturned as being beyond the powers given. After this decision, the British government issued an [[Order in Council]], a primary exercise of the royal prerogative, to achieve the same objective. This Order was also ruled unlawful by the [[High Court of England and Wales|High Court]], a ruling upheld in the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]].  However on Wednesday, 22 October 2008, the government won its appeal in the [[Judicial Committee of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] against the previous rulings. The House decided by a three-to-two majority that the Order in Council was a lawful exercise of authority. <ref>[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hdjVkpT6_bzQxOkAQiXHQRIerOtw Britain wins appeal over Chagos islanders' return home]</ref><ref>[http://ukpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5jAGxtNEsx6bLfJqWoxpoftSmC98A Chagos islanders cannot return home]</ref> In their speeches, the Law Lords admitted the government of the day was morally wrong to force out some 2,000 residents of the Chagos Archipelago, a British Crown colony, to make way for a US air base in the 1960s. Nevertheless, the majority could not find legal fault in the Order.  . 

==Spain==. 
{{also|Monarchy of Spain}} . 

The [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]], Title II ''The Crown'', Article 62, delineates the powers of the king, while Title IV ''Government and Administration'', Article 99, defines the king's role in government. <ref name="Wiki Source Spa Constitution 78">[http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Constituci%C3%B3n_espa%C3%B1ola_de_1978:_04 Título II.

Del Poder Judicial]</ref> However, by [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] established by [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]], the king exercises his prerogatives having solicited government advice while maintaining a politically [[non-partisan]] and independent monarchy. Receiving government advice does not necessarily bind the monarch into executing the advice, except where prescribed by the constitution.  .
