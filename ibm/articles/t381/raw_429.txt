{{Forms of government}} . 

'''Constitutional monarchy''' (or '''limited monarchy''') is a form of [[government]] in which a [[monarch]] acts as [[head of state]] within the parameters of a [[constitution]], whether it be a written, [[Uncodified constitution|uncodified]], or blended constitution. This form of government differs from [[absolute monarchy]] in which an absolute monarch serves as the source of power in the state and is not legally bound by any constitution and has the powers to regulate his or her respective government.  . 

Most constitutional monarchies employ a [[parliamentary system]] in which the monarch may have strictly ceremonial duties or may have reserve powers, depending on the constitution. Under most modern constitutional monarchies there is also a [[prime minister]] who is the head of government and exercises effective political power. There also exist today several [[federal constitutional monarchies]]. In these countries, each subdivision has a distinct government and head of government, but all subdivisions share a monarch who is head of state of the federation as a united whole.  . 

Contemporary constitutional monarchies include the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Commonwealth realms]], [[Belgium]], [[Bhutan]], [[Bahrain]], [[Cambodia]], [[Denmark]], [[Japan]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Lesotho]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Malaysia]], [[Monaco]], [[Morocco]], the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Spain]], [[Swaziland]], [[Sweden]], and [[Thailand]].  . 

The latest country that was completely transformed from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional democratic monarchy is [[Bhutan]].  . 

==Constitutional and absolute monarchy==. 
===Constitutional monarchy in the European tradition===. 
In Britain, the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 led to a constitutional monarchy restricted by laws such as the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] and the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], although limits on the power of the monarch ('a limited monarchy') are much older than that (see [[Magna Carta]]). With the Hanoverian accession in Britain onwards, monarchs saw their powers pass further to their ministers, and Royal neutrality in politics became cemented from around the start of the reign of [[Queen Victoria]] (though she had her personal favorites) and enlargements to the franchise. Today, the role is by convention effectively ceremonial. <ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/HowtheMonarchyworks/Whatisconstitutionalmonarchy.aspx| accessdate=11 March 2010| title=What is constitutional monarchy?| publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy}}</ref> Instead, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] and the [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]] - chiefly in the office of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] - exercise their powers under [[Royal Prerogative|'Royal (or Crown) Prerogative']]: on behalf of the Monarch and through powers still formally possessed by the Monarch. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/monarchy/| accessdate=13 September 2011| title=Monarchy - Background| publisher=politics.co.UK}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/crown-prerogative/| accessdate=13 September 2011| title=Crown Prerogative | publisher=Official website of the UK Parliament}}</ref> No person may accept significant public office without swearing an [[Oath of Allegiance (United Kingdom)|oath of allegiance to the Queen]]. <ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/rp2001/rp01-116.pdf RESEARCH PAPER 01/116]</ref>   . 

Constitutional monarchy occurred first in continental Europe, briefly in the early years of the [[French revolution]], but much more widely afterwards. [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] is considered the first monarch proclaiming ''himself'' as an embodiment of the nation, rather than as a divinely-appointed ruler; this interpretation of monarchy is germane to continental constitutional monarchies. G.W.F. [[Hegel]], in his ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]'' (1820), gave it a philosophical justification that concurred with evolving contemporary political theory and the Protestant Christian view of natural law. Hegel's forecast of a constitutional monarch with very limited powers whose function is to embody the national character and provide constitutional continuity in times of emergency was reflected in the development of constitutional monarchies in Europe and Japan. His forecast of the form of government suitable to the modern world may be seen as prophetic: the largely ceremonial offices of president in some modern parliamentary democracies in Europe and e.g. Israel can be perceived as elected or appointed versions of Hegel's constitutional monarch; the Russian and French presidents, with their stronger powers, may also be regarded in Hegelian terms as wielding powers suitable to the embodiment of the national will.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} . 

===Modern constitutional monarchy===. 
As originally conceived, a constitutional monarch was quite a powerful figure, head of the [[executive branch]] even though his or her power was limited by the constitution and the elected parliament. Some of the framers of the US Constitution may have conceived of the president as being an elected constitutional monarch, as the term was understood in their time, following [[Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu's]] account of the separation of powers. <ref>[[Baron de Montesquieu]], ''The Spirit of Laws''.  Legal Classics Library, 1924. </ref> . 

The present concept of constitutional monarchy developed in the United Kingdom, where it was the democratically elected parliaments, and their leader, the [[prime minister]], who had become those who exercised power, with the monarchs voluntarily ceding it and contenting themselves with the titular position.  In many cases even the monarchs themselves, while still at the very top of the political and social hierarchy, were given the status of "servants of the people" to reflect the new, egalitarian view. In the course of [[France]]'s [[July Monarchy]], [[Louis-Philippe I, King of the French|Louis-Philippe I]] was styled "King of the French" rather than "King of France".  . 

Following the [[Unification of Germany]], [[Otto von Bismarck]] rejected the British model. In the kind of constitutional monarchy established under the [[Constitution of the German Empire]] which Bismarck inspired, the [[Kaiser]] retained considerable actual executive power, and the [[Reichskanzler|Prime Minister]] needed no parliamentary vote of confidence and ruled solely by the imperial mandate. However, this model of constitutional monarchy was discredited and abolished following Germany's defeat in the [[First World War]]. Later on, [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] could also be considered as a "constitutional monarchy" of a kind, in the sense that there was a [[King of Italy|king]] as the titular head of state while actual power was held by [[Benito Mussolini]] under a constitution. This eventually discredited the Italian monarchy and led to its abolition in 1946. After the Second World War, surviving European monarchies almost invariably adopted some variant of the constitutional monarchy model originally developed in Britain.  . 

In present terms, the difference between a [[parliamentary democracy]] that is a constitutional monarchy and one that is a [[republic]] is sometimes considered more one of detail than of substance. In both cases, the titular head of state - monarch or president - serves the traditional role of embodying and representing the nation, while the actual governing is carried out by a cabinet composed predominantly of elected [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]]. In some cases, constitutional monarchies have been dubbed "[[crowned republic]]s". <ref>{{Cite book| last=Boyce| first=Peter| title=The Queen's Other Realms| publisher=Federation Press| year=2008| location=Annandale| page=1| url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=kY-Tk0-quyoC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false| isbn=9781862877009}}</ref> . 

However, there are three important factors that set aside monarchies such as the [[United Kingdom]] from systems where greater power might otherwise rest with [[Parliament]]. These are the issue of [[Royal Prerogative]] where the reigning monarch may continue to exercise power under certain very limited circumstances, [[Sovereign Immunity]] where they are considered to have ''done no wrong'' under the law, and may avoid both taxation and planning permission for example, and considerable '''ceremonial power''' where the executive, judiciary, police and armed forces owe [[allegiance]] to the Crown.  . 

Today constitutional monarchies are mostly associated with [[Western European]] countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Spain]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Monaco]], [[Liechtenstein]], and [[Sweden]]. However, the two most populous constitutional monarchies in the world are in Asia: Japan and Thailand. In such cases it is the [[prime minister]] who holds the day-to-day powers of governance, while the King or Queen (or other monarch, such as a Grand Duke, in the case of Luxembourg, or Prince in the case of Monaco and Liechtenstein) retains only residual (but not always minor) powers.  The powers of the monarch differ between countries. In the Netherlands, Denmark and in Belgium, for example, the Monarch formally appoints a representative to preside over the creation of a [[coalition government]] following a parliamentary election, while in [[Norway]] the King chairs special meetings of the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]].  . 

In nearly all cases, the monarch is still the nominal chief executive, but is bound by [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] to act on the advice of the Cabinet.  Only a few monarchies (most notably [[Japan]] and [[Sweden]]) have amended their constitutions so that the monarch is no longer even the nominal chief executive.  . 

The most significant family of constitutional monarchies in the world today are the sixteen [[Commonwealth realm]]s under [[Elizabeth II]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/QueenandCommonwealth/WhatisaCommonwealthRealm.aspx|title=Website of the British Monarchy: What is a Commonwealth realm?|accessdate=19 September 2010}}</ref> Unlike some of their continental European counterparts, the Monarch and her Governors-General in the Commonwealth realms hold significant "reserve" or "prerogative" powers, to be wielded in times of extreme emergency or constitutional crises usually to uphold parliamentary government. An instance of a Governor General exercising his power was during the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]], when the Australian Prime Minister of the time, [[Gough Whitlam]], was dismissed by the Governor-General. The Australian senate had threatened to block the Government's budget by refusing to pass the associated appropriation bills. On 11 November 1975, Whitlam intended to call a half-Senate election in an attempt to break the deadlock. When he went to seek the Governor-General's approval of the election, the Governor-General instead dismissed him as Prime Minister, and shortly thereafter installed leader of the opposition [[Malcolm Fraser]] in his place. Acting quickly before all parliamentarians became aware of the change of government, Fraser and his allies were able to secure passage of the appropriation bills, and the Governor-General dissolved Parliament for a [[double dissolution]] election. Fraser and his government were returned with a massive majority. This led to much speculation among Whitlam's supporters as to whether this use of the Governor-General's reserve powers was appropriate, and whether [[Republicanism in Australia|Australia should become a republic]]. Among supporters of constitutional monarchy however, the experience confirmed the value of the monarchy as a source of checks and balances against elected politicians who might seek powers in excess of those conferred by their respective constitutions, and ultimately as a safeguard against dictatorship.  . 

In Thailand's constitutional monarchy, the monarch is recognized as the Head of State, Head of the Armed Forces, Upholder of the Buddhist Religion, and Defender of the Faith. The current King, [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]], is the longest reigning current monarch in the world and in all of Thailand's history. <ref name="longestthai">{{cite web |year=1996 |url=http://www.worldhop.com/Journals/J5/ROYAL.HTM |title=A Royal Occasion speeches |publisher=Worldhop.com Journal |accessdate=2006-07-05}}</ref> Bhumibol has reigned through several political changes in the Thai government. He has played an influential role in each incident, often acting as mediator between disputing political opponents. (See Bhumibol's role in [[Bhumibol_Adulyadej#Role_in_Thai_politics|Thai Politics]].) While the monarch retains some powers from the constitution, most particular is [[Lèse majesté]] which protects the image and ability of the monarch to play a role in politics and carries modest criminal penalties for violators. Generally, the Thai people are reverent of Bhumibol. Much of his social influence comes from that and the fact that the royal family is often involved in socio-economic improvement efforts.  . 

In both the United Kingdom and elsewhere, a common debate centres around when it is appropriate for a monarch to use his or her political powers. When a monarch does act, political controversy can often ensue, partially because the neutrality of the crown is seen to be compromised in favour of a [[partisan (political)|partisan]] goal, while some [[political scientist]]s champion the idea of an "interventionist monarch" as a check against possible illegal action by politicians. There are currently 44 monarchies, and most of them are constitutional monarchies.  .

==Former monarchies==. 
* The [[History of China#Imperial era|Chinese Empire]] - last Imperial Chinese rule was by the [[Qing Dynasty]] 清朝 1644–1912 - During its reign, the Qing Dynasty became highly integrated with Chinese culture. However, its military power weakened during the 19th century, and faced with international pressure, massive rebellions and defeats in wars, the Qing Dynasty declined after the mid-19th century. The Qing Dynasty was overthrown following the Xinhai Revolution, when the Empress Dowager Longyu abdicated on behalf of the last emperor, Puyi, on February 12, 1912. 
* The [[Korean Empire]] (Korean: 대한제국, Hanja: 大韓帝國) from 1897 to 1910 - was an empire of [[Korea]] that succeeded the [[Joseon Dynasty]] that ruled the nation over the past 500 years. On August 22, 1910, the Korean Empire was annexed by [[Japan]] with the [[Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty]], beginning a 35-year period of [[Korea under Japanese rule]]. 
* The [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], formed after the [[Union of Lublin]] in 1569 and lasting until the final partition of the state in 1795, operated much like many modern European constitutional monarchies (into which it was officially changed by the establishment of the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791]], which historian [[Norman Davies]] calls "the first constitution of its kind in Europe"<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jrVW9W9eiYMC&pg=PA699 |first=Norman |last=Davies |title=Europe: A History |year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=699 |isbn=0198201710}}</ref>). The legislators of the unified state truly did not see it as a monarchy at all, but as ''a republic under the presidency of the King''. Poland-Lithuania also followed the principle of "Rex regnat et non gubernat", had a bicameral parliament, and a collection of entrenched legal documents amounting to a constitution along the lines of the modern [[United Kingdom]]. The King was elected, and had the duty of maintaining the people's rights. 
* The [[Anglo-Corsican Kingdom]] was a brief period in the [[history of Corsica]] (1794–1796) when the island broke with [[Revolutionary France]] and sought military protection from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. Corsica became an independent kingdom under [[George III]] of England, but with its own elected parliament and a written constitution guaranteeing local autonomy and democratic rights. 
* [[France]], several times during the 19th century. [[Napoleon I of France|Napoléon Bonaparte]] proclaimed himself Emperor of the French in what was ostensibly a constitutional monarchy, though modern historians often class his reign as a military dictatorship. The [[Bourbon Restoration]] (under [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] and [[Charles X of France|Charles X]]), the [[July Monarchy]] (under [[Louis-Philippe]]), and the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] (under [[Napoleon III]]) were also constitutional monarchies, although the power of the monarch varied considerably between them. 
* The [[German Empire]] from 1871 to 1918, (as well as earlier confederations, and the monarchies it consisted of) was also a constitutional monarchy—see [[Constitution of the German Empire]]. 
* Prior to the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979, [[Iran]] was a constitutional monarchy under [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi]], which had been originally established during the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]] in 1906. 
* [[Portugal]] between 1822-1823, 1826-1828 and finally from 1834 until 1910, when [[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel II]] was overthrown by a military coup. 
* [[Kingdom of Serbia]], until 1918, when it merged with the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs into the unitary Yugoslav Kingdom, that was led by the Serbian dynasty of [[Karadjordjevic]]
* [[Mexico]] was twice an [[Mexican Empire|Empire]]. First from July 21, 1822, to March 19, 1823, with [[Agustín de Iturbide]] serving as emperor. Then, with the help of the Austrian and Spanish crowns, [[Napoleon III of France]] installed [[Maximilian of Habsburg]] as Emperor of Mexico. This attempt to create a European-style monarchy lasted three years, from 1864 to 1867. 
* [[Brazil]] from 1815 (United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and Algarves) until 1822, with the proclamation of independence and rise of the [[Empire of Brazil]] by [[Pedro I of Brazil]]. The empire ended in 1889, when [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] was deposed by a military coup. 
* [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]] was a constitutional monarchy from the unification of the smaller independent chiefdoms of O{{okina}}ahu, Maui, Moloka{{okina}}i, Lāna{{okina}}i, and the Hawai{{okina}}i (or the "Big Island") in 1810 until the overthrow of [[Liliuokalani of Hawaii|Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani]] in 1893 by conspirators from United States. 
* The [[Grand Principality of Finland]] was a constitutional monarchy though its ruler, [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], was simultaneously an [[Autocracy|autocrat]] and [[Absolute monarchy|absolute ruler]] in [[Russia]]. 
* The [[Kingdom of Laos]] was a constitutional monarchy until 1975, when [[Savang Vatthana|Sisavang Vatthana]] was forced to abdicate by the communist, the [[Pathet Lao]]. 
* The [[Kingdom of Hungary]].  In 1848–1849 and 1867–1918 as part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. In the interwar period (1920–1944) [[Hungary]] remained a constitutional monarchy without a reigning monarch. 
* [[Montenegro]] until 1918 when it merged with [[Serbia]] and other areas to form [[Yugoslavia]]. 
* [[Yugoslavia]] until 1945 when [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]] was deposed by the communist government. 
* [[Kingdom of Romania]] until 1947 when [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]] was forced to abdicate at gunpoint by the communists. 
* [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] until 1946 when [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Tsar Simeon]] was deposed by the communist assembly. 
* [[Greece]] until 1967 when [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II]] was deposed by the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|military government]]. The decision was formalised by a [[Greek plebiscite, 1974|plebiscite]] in 05/04/1974. 
* [[Italy]] until June 2, 1946, when a referendum proclaimed the end of the Kingdom and the beginning of the Republic. 
* Many [[Commonwealth republic]]s were constitutional monarchies for some period after their independence. 
*[[Nepal]] until May 28, 2008, when [[Gyanendra of Nepal|King Gyanendra]] was deposed, and the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal was declared. 
*[[Iceland]] The Act of Union, a 1 December 1918 agreement with Denmark, established Iceland as a sovereign kingdom united with Denmark under a common king. Iceland abolished the monarchy and became a republic on 17 June 1944 after the Icelandic constitutional referendum, 24 May 1944. 
*[[Kingdom of Mysore]] . 

==Other situations==. 
* [[Andorra]] is the only monarchy where the head of state is vested jointly in two individuals: co-princes (Bishop of Urgell, President of France)
* [[Andorra]], [[Monaco]] and [[Liechtenstein]] are the only countries with a reigning [[Prince]]. 
* [[Japan]] is the only country with a reigning [[Emperor]]. 
* [[Luxembourg]] is the only country with a reigning [[Grand Duke]].  .
