The '''French Revolution''' ({{lang-fr|Révolution française}}; 1789–1799), was a period of [[Political radicalism|radical]] social and political upheaval in [[History of France|France]] that had a major impact on France and indeed all of [[History of Europe|Europe]]. The [[absolute monarchy]] that had ruled France for centuries collapsed in three years. French society underwent an epic transformation as [[feudalism|feudal]], aristocratic and religious privileges evaporated under a sustained assault from [[Political radicalism|radical]] [[left-wing#History of the term|left-wing]] political groups, [[Sans-culottes|masses on the streets]], and peasants in the countryside. Old ideas about tradition and hierarchy – of [[monarchy]], [[aristocracy]] and [[Clericalism|religious authority]] – were abruptly overthrown by new [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles of [[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|equality]], [[citizenship]] and [[inalienable rights]].  . 

{{History of France}} . 

The French Revolution began in 1789 with the convocation of the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] in May. The first year of the Revolution saw members of the [[Third Estate]] proclaiming the [[Tennis Court Oath]] in June, the [[Storming of the Bastille|assault on the Bastille]] in July, the passage of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] in August, and an [[The Women's March on Versailles|epic march on Versailles]] that forced the royal court back to Paris in October. The next few years were dominated by tensions between various [[The Legislative Assembly and the fall of the French monarchy|liberal assemblies]] and a [[right-wing]] monarchy intent on thwarting major reforms.  . 

A [[First French Republic|republic]] was proclaimed in September 1792 and [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]] was executed the next year. External threats also played a dominant role in the development of the Revolution. The [[French Revolutionary Wars]] started in 1792 and ultimately featured [[Military history of France|spectacular French victories]] that facilitated the conquest of the [[Italian Peninsula]], the [[Low Countries]] and most territories west of the [[Rhine]] – achievements that had defied previous French governments for centuries.  . 

Internally, popular sentiments radicalized the Revolution significantly, culminating in the rise of [[Maximilien Robespierre]] and the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]] and virtual dictatorship by the [[Committee of Public Safety]] during the [[Reign of Terror]] from 1793 until 1794 during which between 16,000 and 40,000 people were killed. <ref>Donald Greer, ''The Incidence of the Terror during the French Revolution: A Statistical Interpretation'' (1935). </ref> After the fall of the Jacobins and the execution of Robespierre, the [[French Directory|Directory]] assumed control of the French state in 1795 and held power until 1799, when it was replaced by the Consulate under [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].  . 

After the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and ensuing rise and fall of Napoleon's [[First French Empire]], a [[Bourbon Restoration|restoration of absolutist monarchy]] was followed by two further successful smaller revolutions ([[July Revolution|1830]] and [[French Revolution of 1848|1848]]).  This meant the 19th century and process of [[modern France]] taking shape saw France again successively governed by a similar cycle of [[July Monarchy|constitutional monarchy]] (1830–48), fragile [[French Second Republic|republic (Second Republic)]] (1848–1852), and [[Second French Empire|empire (Second Empire)]] (1852–1870). 
The [[modern history|modern era]] has unfolded in the shadow of the French Revolution. The growth of republics and [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]], the spread of [[secularism]], the development of modern [[ideology|ideologies]] and the invention of [[total war]]<ref>{{Cite book |title=The First Total War: Napoleon's Europe and the birth of warfare as we know it |last=Bell|first=David Avrom |year=2007 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |location=New York |isbn=0618349650 |page=51 |url= |quote=The French Revolution, which began in 1789 and led to the total war of 1792–1815.... }}</ref> all mark their birth during the Revolution.  . 

==Causes==. 
{{Main|Causes of the French Revolution}}
[[File:Ludvig XVI av Frankrike porträtterad av AF Callet.jpg|thumb|The government of King [[Louis XVI of France]] faced a fiscal crisis in the 1780s.]]
Adherents of most historical models identify many of the same features of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' as being among the causes of the Revolution. Economic factors included [[hunger]] and [[malnutrition]] in the most destitute segments of the population, due to rising bread prices (from a normal 8 [[Solidus (coin)|sous]] for a four-pound loaf to 12 sous by the end of 1789),<ref>Hibbert. Pg 96. </ref> after several years of poor [[grain]] harvests. Bad harvests (caused in part by extreme weather from [[El Niño]] along with volcanic activity at [[Laki]] and [[Grímsvötn]] in 1783–1784), rising food prices, and an inadequate transportation system that hindered the shipment of bulk foods from rural areas to large population centers contributed greatly to the destabilization of French society in the years leading up to the Revolution.  . 

Another cause was the state's effective bankruptcy due to the enormous cost of previous wars, particularly the financial strain caused by French participation in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The national debt amounted to some 1,000–2,000&nbsp;million {{citation needed|date=April 2011}} [[livre tournois|livres]]. The social burdens caused by war included the huge war debt, made worse by the loss of France's colonial possessions in North America and the growing commercial dominance of Great Britain. France's inefficient and antiquated financial system was unable to manage the [[government debt|national debt]], something which was both partially caused and exacerbated by the burden of an inadequate system of taxation. To obtain new money to head off default on the government's loans, the king called an [[Assembly of Notables]] in 1787.  . 

Meanwhile, the royal court at [[Versailles]] was seen as being isolated from, and indifferent to, the hardships of the lower classes. While in theory [[King Louis XVI]] was an absolute monarch, in practice he was often indecisive and known to back down when faced with strong opposition. While he did reduce government expenditures, opponents in the [[parlement]]s successfully thwarted his attempts at enacting much needed reforms. Those who were opposed to Louis' policies further undermined royal authority by distributing pamphlets (often reporting false or exaggerated information) that criticized the government and its officials, stirring up public opinion against the monarchy. <ref name="britannicatraite">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/602094/traite|title=Encyclopædia Britannica&nbsp;— Traite|accessdate=16 October 2008}}</ref> . 

Many other factors involved resentments and aspirations given focus by the rise of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals. These included resentment of royal [[political absolutism|absolutism]]; resentment by peasants, laborers and the [[bourgeoisie]] toward the traditional [[manorialism|seigneurial]] privileges possessed by the nobility; resentment of the Church's influence over public policy and institutions; aspirations for [[freedom of religion]]; resentment of aristocratic bishops by the poorer rural clergy; aspirations for social, political and economic equality, and (especially as the Revolution progressed) [[republicanism]]; hatred of Queen [[Marie-Antoinette]], who was falsely accused of being a spendthrift and an [[Holy Roman Empire|Austrian]] spy; and anger toward the King for firing finance minister [[Jacques Necker]], among others, who were popularly seen as representatives of the people. <ref>William Doyle, ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'' (2nd ed. 2003), pp.73–74</ref> . 

==Pre-revolution==. 
===Financial crisis===. 
[[File:Troisordres.jpg|thumb|Caricature of the Third Estate carrying the First Estate (clergy) and the Second Estate (nobility) on its back.]]
[[Louis XVI]] ascended to the throne amidst a [[financial crisis]]; the state was nearing bankruptcy and outlays outpaced income. <ref>Frey, p. 3</ref> This was because of France’s financial obligations stemming from involvement in the [[Seven Years War]] and its participation in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/history/european/frenchrev/section1.html|title=France's Financial Crisis: 1783–1788|accessdate=26 October 2008}}</ref> In May 1776, finance minister [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] was dismissed, after he failed to enact reforms. The next year, [[Jacques Necker]], a foreigner, was appointed Comptroller-General of Finance. He could not be made an official minister because he was a Protestant. <ref name="Hib35">Hibbert, p. 35, 36</ref> . 

Necker realized that the country's extremely [[regressive tax|regressive]] tax system subjected the lower classes to a heavy burden,<ref name="Hib35"/> while numerous exemptions existed for the nobility and clergy. <ref name="Frey2">Frey, p. 2</ref> He argued that the country could not be taxed higher; that tax exemptions for the nobility and clergy must be reduced; and proposed that borrowing more money would solve the country's fiscal shortages. Necker published a report to support this claim that underestimated the deficit by roughly 36&nbsp;million livres, and proposed restricting the power of the ''[[parlement]]s''. <ref name="Hib35"/> . 

This was not received well by the King's ministers and Necker, hoping to bolster his position, argued to be made a minister. The King refused, Necker was fired, and [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne]] was appointed to the Comptrollership. <ref name="Hib35"/> Calonne initially spent liberally, but he quickly realized the critical financial situation and proposed a new [[tax code]]. <ref name="D34">Doyle, ''The French Revolution: A very short introduction'', p. 34</ref> . 

The proposal included a consistent [[Land value tax|land tax]], which would include taxation of the nobility and clergy. Faced with opposition from the parlements, Calonne organised the summoning of the [[Assembly of Notables]]. But the Assembly failed to endorse Calonne's proposals and instead weakened his position through its criticism. In response, the King announced the calling of the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General for May 1789]], the first time the body had been summoned since 1614. This was a signal that the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon monarchy]] was in a weakened state and subject to the demands of its people. <ref name="D36">Doyle 2003, p. 93</ref> . 

===Estates-General of 1789===. 
{{Main|Estates-General of 1789}}
The Estates-General was organized into three estates: the clergy, the nobility, and the rest of [[France]]. <ref name="Frey 4"/> On the last occasion that the Estates-General had met, in 1614, each estate held one vote, and any two could override the third. The ''Parlement'' of Paris feared the government would attempt to [[gerrymandering|gerrymander]] an assembly to rig the results. Thus, they required that the Estates be arranged as in 1614. <ref name="D38">Doyle 2001, p. 38</ref>
The 1614 rules differed from practices of local assemblies, where each member had one vote and [[Estates of the realm|third estate]] membership was doubled. For example, in the [[Dauphiné]] the provincial assembly agreed to double the number of members of the third estate, hold membership elections, and allow one vote per member, rather than one vote per estate. <ref>Doyle 1989, p.89</ref> . 

The "Committee of Thirty," a body of liberal Parisians, began to agitate against voting by estate. This group, largely composed of the wealthy, argued for the Estates-General to assume the voting mechanisms of Dauphiné. They argued that ancient precedent was not sufficient, because "the people were sovereign."<ref name="Neely 56">Neely, p. 56</ref> Necker convened a Second Assembly of Notables, which rejected the notion of double representation by a vote of 111 to 333. <ref name="Neely 56"/> The King, however, agreed to the proposition on 27 December; but he left discussion of the weight of each vote to the Estates-General itself. <ref name=h42>Hibbert, pp.42–45</ref> . 

Elections were held in the spring of 1789; suffrage requirements for the Third Estate were for French-born or naturalised males only, at least 25 years of age, who resided where the vote was to take place and who paid taxes. 
<blockquote>
''Pour être électeur du tiers état, il faut avoir 25 ans, être français ou naturalisé, être domicilié au lieu de vote et compris au rôle des impositions.''<ref>[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/suffrage_universel/suffrage-1789.asp Assemblée Nationale (French)]</ref>
</blockquote> . 

Strong turnout produced 1,201 delegates, including: "291 nobles, 300 clergy, and 610 members of the Third Estate."<ref name=h42/> To lead delegates, "Books of grievances" (''cahiers de doléances'') were compiled to list problems. <ref name="Frey 4">Frey, pp. 4, 5</ref> The books articulated ideas which would have seemed radical only months before; however, most supported the monarchical system in general. Many assumed the Estates-General would approve future taxes, and Enlightenment ideals were relatively rare. <ref name="D38"/><ref name="Neely35">Neely, pp. 63, 65</ref> . 

Pamphlets by liberal nobles and clergy became widespread after the lifting of press censorship. <ref name="Neely 56"/> The [[Abbé Sieyès]], a theorist and Catholic clergyman, argued the paramount importance of the Third Estate in the pamphlet ''Qu'est-ce que le tiers état?'' ("[[What is the Third Estate?]]"), published in January 1789. He asserted: "What is the Third Estate? Everything. What has it been until now in the political order? Nothing. What does it want to be? Something."<ref name="D38"/><ref>Furet, p. 45</ref> . 

[[File:Estatesgeneral.jpg|thumb|right|The meeting of the Estates General on 5 May 1789 in [[Versailles]].]]
The Estates-General convened in the Grands Salles des Menus-Plaisirs in [[Versailles]] on 5 May 1789 and opened with a three-hour speech by Necker. The Third Estate demanded that the verification of deputies' credentials should be undertaken in common by all deputies, rather than each estate verifying the credentials of its own members internally; negotiations with the other estates failed to achieve this. <ref name="Neely35"/> The commoners appealed to the clergy who replied they required more time. Necker asserted that each estate verify credentials and "the king was to act as arbitrator."<ref name="Hib54">Hibbert, p. 54</ref> Negotiations with the other two estates to achieve this, however, were unsuccessful. <ref>Schama 2004, p.300–301</ref> . 

===National Assembly (1789)===. 
{{Main|National Assembly (French Revolution)}}
[[Image:Le Serment du Jeu de paume.jpg|thumb|right|The National Assembly taking the [[Tennis Court Oath]] (sketch by [[Jacques-Louis David]]).]] . 

On 10 June 1789, Abbé Sieyès moved that the Third Estate, now meeting as the ''Communes'' (English: "Commons"), proceed with verification of its own powers and invite the other two estates to take part, but not to wait for them. They proceeded to do so two days later, completing the process on 17 June. <ref>John Hall Stewart. ''A Documentary Survey of the French Revolution''. New York: Macmillan, 1951, p. 86. </ref> Then they voted a measure far more radical, declaring themselves the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], an assembly not of the Estates but of "the People." They invited the other orders to join them, but made it clear they intended to conduct the nation's affairs with or without them. <ref>Schama 2004, p.303</ref> . 

In an attempt to keep control of the process and prevent the Assembly from convening, Louis XVI ordered the closure of the Salle des États where the Assembly met, making an excuse that the carpenters needed to prepare the hall for a royal speech in two days. Weather did not allow an outdoor meeting, so the Assembly moved their deliberations to a nearby indoor [[real tennis]] court, where they proceeded to swear the [[Tennis Court Oath]] (20 June 1789), under which they agreed not to separate until they had given France a constitution. <ref name="Schama">Schama 2004, p.312</ref> . 

A majority of the representatives of the clergy soon joined them, as did 47 members of the nobility. By 27 June, the royal party had overtly given in, although the military began to arrive in large numbers around Paris and Versailles. Messages of support for the Assembly poured in from Paris and other French cities. <ref name="Schama" /> . 

==National Constituent Assembly (1789–1791)==. 
{{Main|National Constituent Assembly}} . 

===Storming of the Bastille===. 
{{Main|Storming of the Bastille}}
By this time, Necker had earned the enmity of many members of the French court for his overt manipulation of public opinion. [[Marie Antoinette of Austria|Marie Antoinette]], the King's younger brother the [[Charles X of France|Comte d'Artois]], and other conservative members of the King's [[privy council]] urged him to dismiss Necker as financial advisor. On 11 July 1789, after Necker published an inaccurate account of the government's debts and made it available to the public, the King fired him, and completely restructured the finance ministry at the same time. <ref>Schama 2004, p.317</ref> . 

Many Parisians presumed Louis's actions to be aimed against the Assembly and began open rebellion when they heard the news the next day. They were also afraid that arriving soldiers – mostly foreign mercenaries – had been summoned to shut down the [[National Constituent Assembly]]. The Assembly, meeting at Versailles, went into nonstop session to prevent another eviction from their meeting place. Paris was soon consumed by riots, chaos, and widespread looting. The mobs soon had the support of some of the [[Gardes Françaises|French Guard]], who were armed and trained soldiers. <ref>Schama 2004, p.331</ref>
[[Image:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] of 26 August 1789]]
On 14 July, the insurgents set their eyes on the large weapons and ammunition cache inside the [[Bastille]] fortress, which was also perceived to be a symbol of royal power. After several hours of combat, the prison fell that afternoon. Despite ordering a cease fire, which prevented a mutual massacre, Governor Marquis [[Bernard de Launay]] was beaten, stabbed and decapitated; his head was placed on a pike and paraded about the city. Although the fortress had held only seven prisoners (four forgers, two noblemen kept for immoral behavior, and a murder suspect), the Bastille served as a potent symbol of everything hated under the ''[[Ancien Régime]]''. Returning to the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]] (city hall), the mob accused the ''[[Provost (civil)|prévôt des marchands]]'' (roughly, mayor) [[Jacques de Flesselles]] of treachery and butchered him. <ref>Schama 2004, p.344</ref> . 

The King, alarmed by the violence, backed down, at least for the time being. The [[Marquis de la Fayette]] took up command of the National Guard at Paris. [[Jean-Sylvain Bailly]], president of the Assembly at the time of the [[Tennis Court Oath]], became the city's mayor under a new governmental structure known as the ''commune''. The King visited Paris, where, on 17 July he accepted a [[Flag of France|tricolore]] [[cockade]], to cries of ''Vive la Nation'' ("Long live the Nation") and ''Vive le Roi'' ("Long live the King"). <ref>Schama 2004, p.357</ref> . 

Necker was recalled to power, but his triumph was short-lived. An astute financier but a less astute politician, Necker overplayed his hand by demanding and obtaining a general amnesty, losing much of the people's favour.  . 

As civil authority rapidly deteriorated, with random acts of violence and theft breaking out across the country, members of the nobility, fearing for their safety, fled to neighboring countries; many of these ''[[émigré]]s'', as they were called, funded counter-revolutionary causes within France and urged foreign monarchs to offer military support to a [[counter-revolution]]. <ref>Lefebvre, pp.187–188. </ref> . 

By late July, the spirit of [[popular sovereignty]] had spread throughout France. In rural areas, many commoners began to form militias and arm themselves against a foreign invasion: some attacked the [[chateau|châteaux]] of the nobility as part of a general agrarian insurrection known as ''"la Grande Peur"'' ("the [[Great Fear]]"). In addition, wild rumours and paranoia caused widespread unrest and civil disturbances that contributed to the collapse of law and order. <ref>Hibbert, 93</ref> . 

===Working toward a constitution===. 
{{Main|French Revolution from the abolition of feudalism to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy}} . 

On 4 August 1789, the National Constituent Assembly abolished [[feudalism]] (although at that point there had been sufficient peasant revolts to almost end feudalism already), in what is known as the [[August Decrees]], sweeping away both the seigneurial rights of the Second Estate and the [[:wikt:tithe|tithe]]s gathered by the First Estate. In the course of a few hours, nobles, clergy, towns, provinces, companies and cities lost their special privileges.  . 

On 26 August 1789, the Assembly published the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], which comprised a statement of principles rather than a constitution with legal effect. The National Constituent Assembly functioned not only as a legislature, but also as a [[Constituent assembly|body to draft a new constitution]].  . 

Necker, Mounier, Lally-Tollendal and others argued unsuccessfully for a senate, with members appointed by the crown on the nomination of the people. The bulk of the nobles argued for an aristocratic [[upper house]] elected by the nobles. The popular party carried the day: France would have a single, unicameral assembly. The King retained only a "suspensive veto"; he could delay the implementation of a law, but not block it absolutely. The Assembly eventually replaced the historic [[Provinces of France|provinces]] with 83 ''départements,'' uniformly administered and roughly equal in area and population.  . 

Amid the Assembly's preoccupation with constitutional affairs, the financial crisis had continued largely unaddressed, and the deficit had only increased. [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Honoré Mirabeau]] now led the move to address this matter, and the Assembly gave Necker complete financial dictatorship.  . 

===Women's March on Versailles===. 
{{Main|The Women's March on Versailles}}
[[File:Women's March on Versailles01.jpg|thumb|Engraving of the Women's March on Versailles, 5 October 1789]] . 

Fueled by rumors of a reception for the King's bodyguards on 1 October 1789 at which the national cockade had been trampled upon, on 5 October 1789 crowds of women began to assemble at Parisian markets. The women first marched to the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]], demanding that city officials address their concerns. <ref>Doyle 1989, p.121</ref> The women were responding to the harsh economic situations they faced, especially bread shortages. They also demanded an end to royal efforts to block the National Assembly, and for the King and his administration to move to Paris as a sign of good faith in addressing the widespread poverty.  . 

Getting unsatisfactory responses from city officials, as many as 7,000 women joined the march to Versailles, bringing with them cannons and a variety of smaller weapons. Twenty thousand National Guardsmen under the command of La Fayette responded to keep order, and members of the mob stormed the palace, killing several guards. <ref>Doyle 1989, p.122</ref> La Fayette ultimately persuaded the king to accede to the demand of the crowd that the monarchy relocate to Paris.  . 

On 6 October 1789, the King and the royal family moved from Versailles to Paris under the "protection" of the National Guards, thus legitimizing the National Assembly.  . 

===Revolution and the Church===. 
{{Main|Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|Civil Constitution of the Clergy}}
[[Image:Decret de l'Assemblée National qui supprime les Ordres Religieux et Religieuses.jpg|thumb| In this caricature, monks and nuns enjoy their new freedom after the decree of 16 February 1790]] . 

The Revolution caused a massive shift of power from the Roman Catholic Church to the state. Under the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'', the Church had been the largest single landowner in the country, owning about 10% of the land in the kingdom. <ref name="ReferenceA">Censer and Hunt, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution, 4. </ref> The Church was exempt from paying taxes to the government, while it levied a [[tithe]]—a 10% tax on income, often collected in the form of crops—on the general population, which it then redistributed to the poor. <ref name="ReferenceA"/> The power and wealth of the Church was highly resented by some groups. A small minority of Protestants living in France, such as the [[Huguenots]], wanted an anti-Catholic regime and revenge against the clergy who discriminated against them. Enlightenment thinkers such as [[Voltaire]] helped fuel this resentment by denigrating the Catholic Church and destabilizing the French monarchy. <ref>Censer and Hunt, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution, 16. </ref> As historian [[John McManners]] argues, "In eighteenth-century France throne and altar were commonly spoken of as in close alliance; their simultaneous collapse ... would one day provide the final proof of their interdependence."<ref>John McManners, The French Revolution and the Church, 5. </ref> . 

This resentment toward the Church weakened its power during the opening of the [[Estates General (France)|Estates General]] in May 1789. The Church composed the [[First Estate]] with 130,000 members of the clergy. When the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] was later created in June 1789 by the [[Third Estate]], the clergy voted to join them, which perpetuated the destruction of the Estates General as a governing body. <ref>John McManners, The French Revolution and the Church, 50, 4. </ref> The National Assembly began to enact social and economic reform. Legislation sanctioned on 4 August 1789 abolished the Church's authority to impose the tithe. In an attempt to address the financial crisis, the Assembly declared, on 2 November 1789, that the property of the Church was "at the disposal of the nation."<ref>National Assembly legislation cited in John McManners, The French Revolution and the Church, 27. </ref> They used this property to back a new currency, the [[assignats]]. Thus, the nation had now also taken on the responsibility of the Church, which included paying the clergy, caring for the poor, the sick and the orphaned. <ref>John McManners, The French Revolution and the Church, 27. </ref> In December, the Assembly began to sell the lands to the highest bidder to raise revenue, effectively decreasing the value of the assignats by 25% in two years. <ref name="ReferenceB">Censer and Hunt, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution, 61. </ref> In autumn 1789, legislation abolished [[monastic vows]] and on 13 February 1790 all religious orders were dissolved. <ref>Emmet Kennedy, A Cultural History of the French Revolution, 148. </ref> [[Monk]]s and [[nun]]s were encouraged to return to private life and a small percentage did eventually marry. <ref name="ReferenceC">Censer and Hunt, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution, 92. </ref> . 

The [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]], passed on 12 July 1790, turned the remaining clergy into employees of the state. This established an election system for parish priests and bishops and set a pay rate for the clergy. Many Catholics objected to the election system because it effectively denied the authority of the Pope in Rome over the French Church. Eventually, in November 1790, the National Assembly began to require an oath of loyalty to the Civil Constitution from all the members of the clergy. <ref name="ReferenceC"/> This led to a schism between those clergy who swore the required oath and accepted the new arrangement and those who remained loyal to the Pope. Overall, 24% of the clergy nationwide took the oath. <ref>Emmet Kennedy, A Cultural History of the French Revolution, 151. </ref> Widespread refusal led to legislation against the clergy, "forcing them into exile, deporting them forcibly, or executing them as traitors."<ref name="ReferenceB"/> [[Pope Pius VI]] never accepted the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, further isolating the Church in France. During the [[Reign of Terror]], extreme efforts of de-Christianization ensued, including the imprisonment and massacre of priests and destruction of churches and religious images throughout France. An effort was made to replace the Catholic Church altogether, with civic festivals replacing religious ones. The establishment of the [[Cult of Reason]] was the final step of radical de-Christianization. These events led to a widespread disillusionment with the Revolution and to counter-rebellions across France. Locals often resisted de-Christianization by attacking revolutionary agents and hiding members of the clergy who were being hunted. Eventually, [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] and the [[Committee of Public Safety]] were forced to denounce the campaign,<ref>Censer and Hunt, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution, 92–94. </ref> replacing the Cult of Reason with the [[deist]] but still non-Christian [[Cult of the Supreme Being]]. The [[Concordat of 1801]] between Napoleon and the Church ended the de-Christianization period and established the rules for a relationship between the Catholic Church and the French State that lasted until it was abrogated by the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] via the [[separation of church and state]] on 11 December 1905. The persecution of the Church led to a counter-revolution known as the [[War in the Vendee|Revolt in the Vendée]], whose suppression is considered by some to be the first modern [[Genocides in history|genocide]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.  . 

===Intrigues and radicalism===. 
Factions within the Assembly began to clarify. The [[aristocracy|aristocrat]] [[Jacques Antoine Marie de Cazalès]] and the [[abbé]] [[Jean-Sifrein Maury]] led what would become known as the [[right-wing politics|right wing]], the opposition to revolution (this party sat on the right-hand side of the Assembly). The "Royalist democrats" or ''monarchiens'', allied with [[Jacques Necker|Necker]], inclined toward organising France along lines similar to the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British constitution]]al model; they included [[Jean Joseph Mounier]], the [[Trophime-Gérard, marquis de Lally-Tollendal|Comte de Lally-Tollendal]], the [[Stanislas Marie Adelaide, comte de Clermont-Tonnerre|comte de Clermont-Tonnerre]], and [[Pierre Victor, baron Malouet|Pierre Victor Malouet, comte de Virieu]].  . 

The "National Party", representing the centre or centre-left of the assembly, included [[Honoré Mirabeau]], La Fayette, and Bailly; while [[Adrien Duport]], [[Antoine Pierre Joseph Marie Barnave|Barnave]] and [[Alexandre Lameth]] represented somewhat more extreme views. Almost alone in his radicalism on the left was the [[Arras, France|Arras]] lawyer [[Maximilien Robespierre]]. Abbé [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès|Sieyès]] led in proposing legislation in this period and successfully forged consensus for some time between the political centre and the [[left-wing politics|left]]. In Paris, various committees, the mayor, the assembly of representatives, and the individual districts each claimed authority independent of the others. The increasingly middle-class [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] under La Fayette also slowly emerged as a power in its own right, as did other self-generated assemblies. 
[[Image:Federation.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Fête de la Fédération]]'' on 14 July 1790 celebrated the establishment of the constitutional monarchy]]
The Assembly abolished the symbolic paraphernalia of the ''Ancien Régime''— armorial bearings, liveries, etc. – which further alienated the more conservative nobles, and added to the ranks of the ''[[émigré]]s''. On 14 July 1790, and for several days following, crowds in the [[Champ de Mars]] celebrated the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille with the ''[[Fête de la Fédération]]''; [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]] performed a [[mass (liturgy)|mass]]; participants swore an oath of "fidelity to the nation, the law, and the king"; the King and the royal family actively participated. <ref>Schama 2004, p.433–434</ref> . 

The electors had originally chosen the members of the [[French Estates-General|Estates-General]] to serve for a single year. However, by the terms of the [[Tennis Court Oath]], the ''communes'' had bound themselves to meet continuously until France had a constitution. Right-wing elements now argued for a new election, but Mirabeau prevailed, asserting that the status of the assembly had fundamentally changed, and that no new election should take place before completing the constitution.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} . 

In late 1790, the French army was in considerable disarray. The military officer corps was largely composed of noblemen, who found it increasingly difficult to maintain order within the ranks. In some cases, soldiers (drawn from the lower classes) had turned against their aristocratic commanders and attacked them. At [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], General [[François Claude Amour, marquis de Bouillé|Bouillé]] successfully put down one such rebellion, only to be accused of being anti-revolutionary for doing so. This and other such incidents spurred a mass desertion as more and more officers defected to other countries, leaving a dearth of experienced leadership within the army. <ref name = "Mignet-Chap3">{{cite book|author=Mignet, François|title=Histoire de la Révolution française|year=1824|page=Chapter III|nopp=true}}</ref> . 

This period also saw the rise of the political "clubs" in French politics. Foremost among these was the [[Jacobin Club]]; 152 members had affiliated with the Jacobins by 10 August 1790. The Jacobin Society began as a broad, general organization for political debate, but as it grew in members, various factions developed with widely differing views. Several of these fractions broke off to form their own clubs, such as the [[Club of '89]]. <ref>Schama 2004, p.449</ref> . 

Meanwhile, the Assembly continued to work on developing a constitution. A new judicial organisation made all magistracies temporary and independent of the throne. The legislators abolished hereditary offices, except for the monarchy itself. [[Jury trial]]s started for criminal cases. The King would have the unique power to propose war, with the legislature then deciding whether to declare war. The Assembly abolished all internal trade barriers and suppressed guilds, masterships, and workers' organisations: any individual gained the right to practice a trade through the purchase of a license; strikes became illegal. <ref>Schama 2004, p.442</ref> . 

In the winter of 1791, the Assembly considered, for the first time, legislation against the ''émigrés''. The debate pitted the safety of the Revolution against the liberty of individuals to leave. Mirabeau prevailed against the measure, which he referred to as "worthy of being placed in the code of [[Draco (lawgiver)|Draco]]". <ref name = "Mignet-Chap3"/> But Mirabeau died on 2 April 1791 and, before the end of the year, the new Legislative Assembly adopted this draconian measure. <ref>Schama 2004, p.496</ref> . 

===Royal flight to Varennes===. 
{{Main|Flight to Varennes}}
[[File:Retour Varennes 1791.jpg|thumb|The return of the royal family to Paris on 25 June 1791, after their failed flight to Varennes]]
Louis XVI, egged on by Marie Antoinette and other members of his family, opposed the course of the Revolution, but rejected the potentially treacherous aid of the other monarchs of Europe. He cast his lot with [[François Claude Amour, marquis de Bouillé|General Bouillé]], who condemned both the emigration and the Assembly, and promised him refuge and support in his camp at [[Montmédy]]. On the night of 20 June 1791, the royal family fled the [[Tuileries Palace]] dressed as servants, while their servants dressed as nobles.  . 

However, late the next day, the King was recognised and arrested at [[Varennes]] (in the [[Meuse]] [[département in France|''département'']]). He and his family were brought back to Paris under guard, still dressed as servants. [[Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve|Pétion]], [[Marie Victor de Fay, Marquis de Latour-Maubourg|Latour-Maubourg]], and [[Antoine Pierre Joseph Marie Barnave]], representing the Assembly, met the royal family at [[Épernay]] and returned with them. From this time, Barnave became a counselor and supporter of the royal family. When they returned to Paris, the crowd greeted them in silence. The Assembly provisionally suspended the King. He and Queen [[Marie Antoinette of Austria|Marie Antoinette]] remained held under guard. <ref>Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition</ref><ref>Lindqvist, Herman (1991). Axel von Fersen.

===Completing the constitution===. 
{{Main|French Revolution from the summer of 1790 to the establishment of the Legislative Assembly#The Last Days of the National Constituent Assembly|l1=The Last Days of the National Constituent Assembly}}
As most of the Assembly still favoured a [[constitutional monarchy]] rather than a republic, the various groups reached a compromise which left Louis XVI as little more than a figurehead: he was forced to swear an oath to the constitution, and a decree declared that retracting the oath, heading an army for the purpose of making war upon the nation, or permitting anyone to do so in his name would amount to abdication. <ref name = "Mignet-Chap4">{{cite book|author=Mignet, François|title=Histoire de la Révolution française|year=1824|page=Chapter IV|nopp=true}}</ref> . 

However, [[Jacques Pierre Brissot]] drafted a petition, insisting that in the eyes of the nation Louis XVI was deposed since his flight. An immense crowd gathered in the [[Champ de Mars]] to sign the petition. [[Georges Danton]] and [[Camille Desmoulins]] gave fiery speeches. The Assembly called for the municipal authorities to "preserve public order". The National Guard under La Fayette's command confronted the crowd. The soldiers responded to a barrage of stones by firing into the crowd, killing between 13 and 50 people. <ref>Schama 2004, p.481</ref> . 

In the wake of this massacre the authorities closed many of the patriotic clubs, as well as radical newspapers such as [[Jean-Paul Marat]]'s ''[[L'Ami du Peuple]]''. Danton fled to England; Desmoulins and Marat went into hiding.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} . 

Meanwhile, a new threat arose from abroad: [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II]], [[Frederick William II of Prussia]], and the King's brother [[Charles X of France|Charles-Philippe, comte d'Artois]], issued the [[Declaration of Pillnitz]], which considered the cause of Louis XVI as their own, demanded his absolute liberty and implied an invasion of France on his behalf if the revolutionary authorities refused its conditions. <ref>Schama 2004, p.500</ref> The French people expressed no respect for the dictates of foreign monarchs, and the threat of force merely hastened their militarisation. <ref>Soboul (1975), pp. 226–227. </ref> . 

Even before the "Flight to Varennes", the Assembly members had determined to debar themselves from the legislature that would succeed them, the [[French Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]]. They now gathered the various constitutional laws they had passed into a single constitution, showed remarkable strength in choosing not to use this as an occasion for major revisions, and submitted it to the recently restored Louis XVI, who accepted it, writing "I engage to maintain it at home, to defend it from all attacks from abroad, and to cause its execution by all the means it places at my disposal". The King addressed the Assembly and received enthusiastic applause from members and spectators. With this capstone, the National Constituent Assembly adjourned in a final session on 30 September 1791. <ref>Lefebvre, p. 212. </ref> . 

Mignet argued that the "constitution of 1791... was the work of the middle class, then the strongest; for, as is well known, the predominant force ever takes possession of institutions... In this constitution the people was the source of all powers, but it exercised none."<ref name="Mignet-Chap4" /> . 

==Legislative Assembly (1791–1792)==. 
===Failure of the constitutional monarchy===. 
{{Main|The Legislative Assembly and the fall of the French monarchy}}
Under the [[French Constitution of 1791|Constitution of 1791]], France would function as a [[constitutional monarchy]]. The King had to share power with the elected [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]], but he still retained his royal veto and the ability to select ministers. The Legislative Assembly first met on 1 October 1791, and degenerated into chaos less than a year later. In the words of the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]]: "In the attempt to govern, the Assembly failed altogether. It left behind an empty [[treasury]], an undisciplined army and navy, and a people debauched by safe and successful riot."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/French_Revolution|title=French Revolution|publisher=About LoveToKnow 1911|accessdate=10 April 2009}}</ref> The Legislative Assembly consisted of about 165 [[Feuillant (political group)|Feuillant]]s (constitutional monarchists) on the [[Right-wing politics|right]], about 330 [[Girondist]]s (liberal republicans) and [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]]s (radical revolutionaries) on the [[Left-wing politics|left]], and about 250 deputies unaffiliated with either faction.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Early on, the King vetoed legislation that threatened the ''émigrés'' with death and that decreed that every [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy|non-juring clergyman]] must take within eight days the civic oath mandated by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Over the course of a year, such disagreements would lead to a [[constitutional crisis]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} . 

===Constitutional crisis===. 
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}
{{Main|10 August (French Revolution)|September Massacres|Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy}}
[[Image:Jacques Bertaux - Prise du palais des Tuileries - 1793 .jpg|thumb|On 10 August 1792 the Paris Commune stormed the Tuileries Palace and massacred the [[Swiss Guard]]s]]
On the night of 10 August 1792, [[Fédéré|insurgents and popular militias]], supported by the revolutionary [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Paris Commune]], assailed the Tuileries Palace and massacred the [[Swiss Guard]]s who were assigned for the protection of the king. The royal family ended up prisoners and a [[Rump legislature|rump session]] of the Legislative Assembly suspended the monarchy; little more than a third of the deputies were present, almost all of them Jacobins. <ref>Pfeiffer, L. B., "The Uprising of June 20, 1792," p.221. New Era Printing Company, Lincoln: 1913."</ref> . 

What remained of a national government depended on the support of the insurrectionary Commune. The Commune sent gangs into the prisons to try arbitrarily and butcher 1400 victims, and addressed a circular letter to the other cities of France inviting them to follow this example. The Assembly could offer only feeble resistance. This situation persisted until the [[French National Convention|Convention]], elected by universal male suffrage and charged with writing a new constitution, met on 20 September 1792 and became the new ''de facto'' government of France. The next day it [[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|abolished the monarchy]] and declared a republic. This date was later retroactively adopted as the beginning of [[Year One]] of the [[French Republican Calendar]].  . 

==War and Counter-Revolution (1792–1797)==. 
{{Main|French Revolutionary Wars|French Counter-Revolution}}
[[File:French Revolution revolutionary uniform.jpg|thumb|A uniform from the French Revolution period.]]
The politics of the period inevitably drove France towards war with Austria and its allies. The King, many of the Feuillants and the Girondins specifically wanted to wage war. The King (and many Feuillants with him) expected war would increase his personal popularity; he also foresaw an opportunity to exploit any defeat: either result would make him stronger. The Girondins wanted to [[export the Revolution]] throughout Europe and, by extension, to defend the Revolution within France. The forces opposing war were much weaker. Barnave and his supporters among the Feuillants feared a war they thought France had little chance to win and which they feared might lead to greater radicalization of the revolution. On the other end of the political spectrum [[Maximilien_Robespierre#Opposition_to_war_with_Austria|Robespierre opposed a war on two grounds]], fearing that it would strengthen the monarchy and military at the expense of the revolution, and that it would incur the anger of ordinary people in Austria and elsewhere. The Austrian emperor [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], brother of [[Marie Antoinette of Austria|Marie Antoinette]], may have wished to avoid war, but he died on 1 March 1792. <ref>Schama 2004, p.505</ref> France preemptively declared war on Austria (20 April 1792) and [[Prussia]] joined on the Austrian side a few weeks later. The invading Prussian army faced little resistance until checked at the [[Battle of Valmy]] (20 September 1792), and forced to withdraw.  . 

The new-born Republic followed up on this success with a series of victories in Belgium and the [[Rhineland]] in the fall of 1792. The French armies defeated the Austrians at the [[Battle of Jemappes]] on 6 November, and had soon taken over most of the Austrian Netherlands. This brought them into conflict with Britain and the [[Dutch Republic]], which wished to preserve the independence of the southern Netherlands from France. After the king's execution in January 1793, these powers, along with Spain and most other European states, joined the war against France. Almost immediately, French forces faced defeat on many fronts, and were driven out of their newly conquered territories in the spring of 1793. At the same time, the republican regime was forced to deal with rebellions against its authority in much of western and southern France. But the allies failed to take advantage of French disunity, and by the autumn of 1793 the republican regime had defeated most of the internal rebellions and halted the allied advance into France itself.  . 

The stalemate was broken in the summer of 1794 with dramatic French victories. They defeated the allied army at the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Battle of Fleurus]], leading to a full Allied withdrawal from the Austrian Netherlands. They followed up by a campaign which swept the allies to the east bank of the Rhine and left the French, by the beginning of 1795, conquering Holland itself. The House of Orange was expelled and replaced by the [[Batavian Republic]], a French satellite state. These victories led to the collapse of the coalition against France. Prussia, having effectively abandoned the coalition in the fall of 1794, made peace with revolutionary France at [[Peace of Basel|Basel]] in April 1795, and soon thereafter Spain, too, made peace with France. Of the major powers, only Britain and Austria remained at war with France.  .

It was during this time that ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' was first sung. Originally titled ''Chant de guerre pour l'Armée du Rhin'' ("War Song for the [[Army of the Rhine (France)|Army of the Rhine]]"), the song was written and composed by [[Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle]] in 1792. It was adopted in 1795 as the nation's first anthem.  .

{{Main|Execution of Louis XVI}}
{{See also|Maximilien_Robespierre#Execution_of_Louis_XVI|l1=Robespierre and the Execution of Louis XVI}}
In the [[Brunswick Manifesto]], the Imperial and Prussian armies threatened retaliation on the French population if it were to resist their advance or the reinstatement of the monarchy. This [[Armoire de fer|among other things]] made Louis appear to be conspiring with the enemies of France. 17 January 1793 saw Louis condemned to death for "conspiracy against the public liberty and the general safety" by a close majority in Convention: 361 voted to execute the king, 288 voted against, and another 72 voted to execute him subject to a variety of delaying conditions. The former Louis XVI, now simply named ''Citoyen Louis Capet'' (Citizen Louis Capet), was executed by [[guillotine]] on 21 January 1793 on the ''Place de la Révolution'', former ''Place Louis XV'', now called the [[Place de la Concorde]]. <ref>Doyle 2002, p. 196</ref> Royalty across Europe was horrified and many heretofore neutral countries soon joined the war against revolutionary France.  . 

===Economy===. 
When war went badly, prices rose and the ''[[sans-culottes]]''&nbsp;— poor labourers and radical Jacobins – rioted; counter-revolutionary activities began in some regions. This encouraged the Jacobins to seize power through a parliamentary [[coup d'état|''coup'']], backed up by force effected by mobilising public support against the [[Girondist]] faction, and by utilising the mob power of the Parisian ''sans-culottes''. An alliance of Jacobin and ''sans-culottes'' elements thus became the effective centre of the new government. Policy became considerably more radical, as [[General maximum|"The Law of the Maximum"]] set food prices and led to executions of offenders. <ref>White, E. "The French Revolution and the Politics of Government Finance, 1770–1815."  ''The Journal of Economic History'' 1995, p 244</ref> This policy of price control was coeval with the [[Committee of Public Safety]]'s rise to power and the [[Reign of Terror]]. The Committee first attempted to set the price for only a limited number of grain products but, by September 1793, it expanded the "maximum" to cover all foodstuffs and a long list of other goods. <ref>Schuettinger, Robert. "Forty Centuries of Wage and Price Controls."  Heritage Foundation, 2009. p. 45</ref> Widespread shortages and famine ensued. The Committee reacted by sending [[dragoon]]s into the countryside to arrest farmers and seize crops. This temporarily solved the problem in Paris, but the rest of the country suffered. By the spring of 1794, forced collection of food was not sufficient to feed even Paris and the days of the Committee were numbered. When Robespierre went to the guillotine in July of that year the crowd jeered, "There goes the dirty maximum!"<ref>Bourne, Henry. "Maximum Prices in France."  American Historical Review, October 1917, p. 112. </ref> . 

===Reign of Terror===. 
{{Main|Reign of Terror}}
[[Image:Cruikshank - The Radical's Arms.png|thumb|Satirical cartoon from England lampooning the excesses of the Revolution as symbolized through the [[guillotine]]: between 18,000 and 40,000 people were executed during the Reign of Terror]]
[[File:Jacques-Louis David - Marie Antoinette on the Way to the Guillotine.jpg|thumb|Queen Marie Antoinette on the way to the guillotine on 16 October 1793 (drawing by [[Jacques-Louis David]])]]
The [[Committee of Public Safety]] came under the control of [[Maximilien Robespierre]], a lawyer, and the Jacobins unleashed the Reign of Terror (1793–1794). According to archival records, at least 16,594 people died under the [[guillotine]] or otherwise after accusations of counter-revolutionary activities. <ref name = "Gough-p77">{{cite book|author=Gough, Hugh|title=The Terror in the French Revolution|year=1998|page=77}}</ref>  A number of historians note that as many as 40,000 accused prisoners may have been summarily executed without trial or died awaiting trial. <ref name = "Gough-p77"/><ref>Doyle 1989, p. 258</ref> . 

On 2 June 1793, Paris sections&nbsp;— encouraged by the ''[[enragés]]'' ("enraged ones") [[Jacques Roux]] and [[Jacques Hébert]] – took over the [[French Convention|Convention]], calling for administrative and political purges, a low fixed price for bread, and a limitation of the electoral [[suffrage|franchise]] to ''[[sans-culottes]]'' alone. <ref>Schama 2004, p.616</ref> With the backing of the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]], they managed to persuade the Convention to arrest 31 Girondin leaders, including [[Jacques Pierre Brissot]]. Following these arrests, the Jacobins gained control of the Committee of Public Safety on 10 June, installing the ''revolutionary dictatorship''. On 13 July, the assassination of [[Jean-Paul Marat]]&nbsp;— a Jacobin leader and journalist known for his bloodthirsty rhetoric&nbsp;— by [[Charlotte Corday]], a Girondin, resulted in further increase of Jacobin political influence. [[Georges Danton]], the leader of the [[10 August (French Revolution)|August 1792 uprising]] against the [[Louis XVI of France|King]], undermined by several political reversals, was removed from the Committee and Robespierre, "the Incorruptible", became its most influential member as it moved to take radical measures against the Revolution's domestic and foreign enemies. <ref>Schama 2004, p.641</ref> . 

Meanwhile, on 24 June, the Convention adopted the first republican constitution of France, variously referred to as the [[French Constitution of 1793]] or Constitution of the Year I. It was progressive and radical in several respects, in particular by establishing [[universal suffrage|universal male suffrage]]. It was ratified by public [[referendum]], but normal legal processes were suspended before it could take effect. <ref>Schama 2004, p.637</ref> . 

===War in the Vendée===. 
{{Main|War in the Vendée}}
[[File:BatailleduMans1793.jpg|thumb|left|The [[War in the Vendée]] was a royalist uprising that was suppressed by the republican forces in 1796]]
In [[Vendée]], peasants revolted against the French Revolutionary government in 1793. They resented the changes imposed on the Roman Catholic Church by the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] (1790) and broke into open revolt in defiance of the Revolutionary government's military [[conscription]]. <ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE2DB1231F934A25755C0A96F948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all In a Corner of France, Long Live the Old Regime], [[New York Times]]</ref> This became a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]], known as the [[War in the Vendée]]. <ref>McPhee, Peter [http://www.h-france.net/vol4reviews/mcphee3.html Review of Reynald Secher, A French Genocide: The Vendée] H-France Review Vol. 4 (March 2004), No. 26</ref> North of the [[Loire river|Loire]], similar revolts were started by the so-called [[Chouannerie|Chouans]] (royalist rebels). <ref>Hibbert, p. 321. </ref> . 

After the defeat at [[Savenay]], when regular warfare in the Vendée was at an end, the French general [[Francois Joseph Westermann]] is argued by some historians to have penned a letter (its veracity is disputed)<ref>Frédéric Augris, Henri Forestier, général à 18 ans, Éditions du Choletais, 1996</ref><ref>Jean-Clément Martin, Contre-Révolution, Révolution et Nation en France, 1789-1799, éditions du Seuil, collection Points, 1998, p. 219</ref> to the Committee of Public Safety, stating:
<blockquote>"There is no more Vendée. It died with its wives and its children by our free sabres. I have just buried it in the woods and the swamps of Savenay. According to the orders that you gave me, I crushed the children under the feet of the horses, massacred the women who, at least for these, will not give birth to any more brigands. I do not have a prisoner to reproach me. I have exterminated all. The roads are sown with corpses. At Savenay, brigands are arriving all the time claiming to surrender, and we are shooting them non-stop... Mercy is not a revolutionary sentiment."''<ref>Davies, Norman. ''Europe: A history'' Pimlico, (1997). p. 705</ref><ref>Schama 2004, p.666</ref></blockquote>
Other historians doubt the authenticity of this document and point out that the claims in it were patently false&nbsp;— there were in fact thousands of living Vendean prisoners, the revolt had been far from crushed, and the Convention had explicitly decreed that women, children and unarmed men were to be treated humanely. <ref>Jean-Clément Martin, Guerre de Vendée, dans l'Encyclopédie Bordas, Histoire de la France et des Français, Paris, Éditions Bordas, 1999, p 2084, et Contre-Révolution, Révolution et Nation en France, 1789–1799, p.218. </ref> It has been hypothesized that if the letter is authentic, Westermann may have been attempting to exaggerate the intensity of his actions and his success, because he was eager to avoid being purged for his opposition to ''[[sans-culotte]]'' generals (he was later guillotined together with Danton's group). <ref>Jean-Clément Martin, ''Violence et Révolution. Essai sur la naissance d'un mythe national'', éditions du Seuil, 2006, p. 181</ref> . 

The revolt and its suppression, including both combat casualties and massacres and executions on both sides, are thought to have taken between 117,000 and 250,000 lives (170,000 according to the latest estimates). <ref>117,000 according to Reynald Secher, ''La Vendée-Vengé, le Génocide franco-français'' (1986); 200,000–250,000 according to Jean-Clément Martin, ''La Vendée et la France'', Éditions du Seuil, collection Points, 1987; 200,000 according to Louis-Marie Clénet, ''La Contre-révolution'', Paris, PUF, collection Que sais-je?, 1992; 170,000 according to Jacques Hussenet (dir.), ''« Détruisez la Vendée ! » Regards croisés sur les victimes et destructions de la guerre de Vendée'', La Roche-sur-Yon, Centre vendéen de recherches historiques, 2007, p.148. </ref> Because of the extremely brutal forms that the Republican repression took in many places, certain historians such as [[Reynald Secher]] have called the event a "[[genocide]]". This description has become popular in the mass media,<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE2DB1231F934A25755C0A96F948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all In a Corner of France, Long Live the Old Regime].

Facing local revolts and foreign invasions in both the East and West of the country, the most urgent government business was the war. On 17 August, the Convention voted for general [[conscription]], the ''[[levée en masse]]'', which mobilized all citizens to serve as soldiers or suppliers in the war effort.  . 

The [[National Convention]] subsequently enacted more legislation, voting on 9 September to establish ''sans-culottes'' paramilitary forces, ''revolutionary armies'', and to force farmers to surrender [[grain]] demanded by the government. On 17 September, the ''[[Law of Suspects]]'' was passed, which authorized the charging of counter-revolutionaries with "crimes against liberty." On 29 September, the Convention extended price limits from grain and bread to other household goods and established the [[General maximum|Law of the Maximum]], intended to prevent price gouging and supply food to the cities. <ref>Schama 2004, p.646</ref> . 

=== The guillotine as a symbol ===. 
The [[guillotine]] became the symbol of a string of executions. Louis XVI had already been guillotined before the start of the terror; Queen Marie Antoinette, Barnave, Bailly, Brissot and other leading Girondins, [[Louis Philip II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe Égalité]] (despite his vote for the death of the King), [[Madame Roland]] and many others were executed by guillotine. The [[Revolutionary Tribunal]] summarily condemned thousands of people to death by the guillotine, while mobs beat other victims to death.  . 

At the peak of the terror, the slightest hint of counter-revolutionary thoughts or activities (or, as in the case of [[Jacques Hébert]], revolutionary zeal exceeding that of those in power) could place one under suspicion, and trials did not always proceed according to contemporary standards of [[due process]]. Sometimes people died for their political opinions or actions, but many for little reason beyond mere suspicion, or because some others had a stake in getting rid of them. Most of the victims received an unceremonious trip to the guillotine in an open wooden cart (the [[tumbrel]]). In the rebellious provinces, the government representatives had unlimited authority and some engaged in extreme repressions and abuses. For example, [[Jean-Baptiste Carrier]] became notorious for the ''[[Drownings at Nantes|Noyades]]'' ("drownings") he organized in [[Nantes]];<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/97009/Jean-Baptiste-Carrier Jean-Baptiste Carrier], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''</ref> his conduct was judged unacceptable even by the Jacobin government and he was recalled. <ref>Soboul (1975), p. 384. </ref> . 

Another [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] uprising was made possible by the installment of the [[French Republican Calendar|Republican Calendar]] on 24 October 1793. Against Robespierre's concepts of [[Deism]] and [[Virtue]], Hébert's (and Chaumette's) [[atheism|atheist]] movement initiated a religious campaign to [[Christianity|dechristianize]] society. The climax was reached with the celebration of the flame of Reason in [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] Cathedral on 10 November. <ref>Schama 2004, p.658</ref>
[[File:Fête de l'Etre suprême 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Cult of the Supreme Being|Festival of the Supreme Being]] on 8 June 1794]]
The Reign of Terror ultimately weakened the revolutionary government, while temporarily ending internal opposition. The Jacobins expanded the size of the army, and [[Lazare Carnot|Carnot]] replaced many aristocratic officers with soldiers who had demonstrated their patriotism, if not their ability. The Republican army was able to throw back the Austrians, [[Prussia]]ns, British, and Spanish. At the end of 1793, the army began to prevail and revolts were defeated with ease. The [[Ventôse Decrees]] (February–March 1794) proposed the confiscation of the goods of exiles and opponents of the Revolution, and their redistribution to the needy. However this policy was never fully implemented. <ref>Schama 2004, p.689</ref> . 

In the spring of 1794, both extremist ''enragés'' such as Hébert and moderate [[The Mountain|Montagnard]] ''indulgents'' such as Danton were charged with counter-revolutionary activities, tried and guillotined. On 7 June Robespierre, who had previously condemned the ''[[Cult of Reason]]'', advocated a new state religion and recommended the Convention acknowledge the existence of the "Supreme Being". <ref>Schama 2004, p.706</ref> . 

===Thermidorian Reaction===. 
{{Main|Thermidorian Reaction}}
[[File:Execution robespierre, saint just....jpg|thumb|The execution of Robespierre on 28 July 1794 marked the end of the Reign of Terror]]
On 27 July 1794, the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] led to the arrest and execution of Robespierre, [[Louis de Saint-Just]], and other leading Jacobins. The new government was predominantly made up of Girondists who had survived the Terror, and after taking power, they took revenge as well by persecuting even those Jacobins who had helped to overthrow Robespierre, banning the Jacobin Club, and executing many of its former members in what was known as the [[White Terror]]. <ref>Soboul (1975), pp. 425–428. </ref><ref>Schama, p.852. </ref> . 

In the wake of excesses of the Terror, the Convention approved the new "Constitution of the Year III" on 22 August 1795. A French [[plebiscite]] ratified the document, with about 1,057,000 votes for the constitution and 49,000 against. <ref name = "Doyle-p320">Doyle 1989, p.320</ref>  The results of the voting were announced on 23 September 1795, and the new constitution took effect on 27 September 1795. <ref name = "Doyle-p320"/> . 

==The Constitutional Republic: The Directory (1795–1799)==. 
{{Main|French Directory}}
The new constitution created the ''Directoire'' ({{lang-en|Directory}}) and the first [[bicameral legislature]] in French history. <ref>Cole et al 1989, p.39</ref> The parliament consisted of two houses: the ''Conseil des Cinq-Cents'' (Council of the Five Hundred), with 500 representatives, and the ''Conseil des Anciens'' (Council of Elders), with 250 senators. Executive power went to five "directors," named annually by the ''Conseil des Anciens'' from a list submitted by the ''Conseil des Cinq-Cents''. Furthermore, the [[universal suffrage|universal male suffrage]] of 1793 was replaced by limited suffrage based on property. <ref>Doyle, ''Oxford History'' (2003) pp 318–40</ref> . 

With the establishment of the Directory, contemporary observers might have assumed that the Revolution was finished. Citizens of the war-weary nation wanted stability, peace, and an end to conditions that at times bordered on chaos. Those who wished to restore the monarchy and the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' by putting [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] on the throne, and those who would have renewed the Reign of Terror were insignificant in number. The possibility of foreign interference had vanished with the failure of the [[First coalition|First Coalition]]. The earlier atrocities had made confidence or goodwill between parties impossible. The same instinct of self-preservation which had led the members of the Convention to claim so large a part in the new legislature and the whole of the Directory impelled them to keep their predominance. However, many French citizens distrusted the Directory,<ref>Doyle, ''Oxford History'' p.331</ref> and the directors could achieve their purposes only by extraordinary means. They habitually disregarded the terms of the constitution, and, even when the elections that they rigged went against them, the directors routinely used draconian police measures to quell dissent. Moreover, to prolong their power the directors were driven to rely on the military, which desired war and grew less and less civic-minded. <ref>Doyle, ''Oxford History'', p.332</ref> . 

Other reasons influenced them in the direction of war. State finances during the earlier phases of the Revolution had been so thoroughly ruined that the government could not have met its expenses without the plunder and the tribute of foreign countries. If peace were made, the armies would return home and the directors would have to face the exasperation of the rank-and-file who had lost their livelihood, as well as the ambition of generals who could, in a moment, brush them aside. [[Paul François Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras|Barras]] and [[Jean-François Rewbell|Rewbell]] were notoriously corrupt themselves and screened corruption in others. The patronage of the directors was ill-bestowed, and the general maladministration heightened their unpopularity. <ref>Doyle, ''Oxford History'', pp. 322–23</ref>
[[Image:Bouchot - Le general Bonaparte au Conseil des Cinq-Cents.jpg|thumb|Napoléon Bonaparte in the ''coup d'état'' of 18 Brumaire, which marked the end of the revolution]] . 

The constitutional party in the legislature desired toleration of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy|nonjuring clergy]], the repeal of the laws against the relatives of the [[émigré]]s, and some merciful discrimination toward the émigrés themselves. The directors baffled all such endeavours. On the other hand, the socialist conspiracy of [[François-Noël Babeuf|Babeuf]] was easily quelled. Little was done to improve the finances, and the [[assignat]]s continued to fall in value.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} . 

The new [[regime|régime]] met opposition from remaining Jacobins and the royalists. The army suppressed riots and counter-revolutionary activities. In this way the army and its successful general, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] eventually gained total power.  . 

On 9 November 1799 (18 Brumaire of the Year VIII) [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] staged the ''[[18 Brumaire|coup of 18 Brumaire]]'' which installed the [[French Consulate|Consulate]]. This effectively led to Bonaparte's dictatorship and eventually (in 1804) to his proclamation as ''Empereur'' (emperor), which brought to a close the specifically [[republicanism|republic]]an phase of the French Revolution. <ref>David Nicholls, ''Napoleon: a biographical companion'' (1999) p. </ref> . 

==Symbolism in the French Revolution==. 
[[Image:Sans-culotte.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Early depiction of the tricolour in the hands of a ''[[sans-culotte]]'' during the French Revolution]]
The French Revolution was a time of upheaval, especially towards traditional ideology, in almost every sense: the current monarch, [[King Louis XVI]], was executed; the Catholic Church was all but abolished; a new [[French Republican Calendar|calendar]] was created; and a new Republican government was established. In order to effectively illustrate the differences between the new Republic and the old regime, the leaders needed to implement a new set of symbols to be celebrated instead of the old religious and monarchical symbolism. To this end, symbols were borrowed from historic cultures and redefined, while those of the old regime were either destroyed or reattributed acceptable characteristics. These revised symbols were used to instill in the public a new sense of tradition and reverence for the Enlightenment and the Republic. <ref name="autogenerated1">Censer and Hunt, "How to Read Images" LEF CD-ROM</ref> . 

===Fasces===. 
[[Fasces]], likes many other symbols of the French Revolution, are Roman in origin. Fasces are a bundle of birch rods containing an axe. In Roman times, the fasces symbolized the power of magistrates who could order the beating of a criminal, representing union and accord with the Roman Republic. <ref name="autogenerated1"/> The French Republic continued this Roman symbol to represent state power, justice, and unity. During the French Revolution the fasces image is seen in conjunction with many other symbols. This is seen with many emblems of the French Revolution. Though seen throughout the French Revolution, perhaps the most well known French reincarnation of the fasces is the Fasces surmounted by a Phrygian cap. This image has no display of an axe or a strong central state; rather, it symbolizes the power of the liberated people by placing the Liberty Cap on top of the classical symbol of power. <ref name="autogenerated1"/> . 

===Liberty cap===. 
The Liberty cap, also known as the [[Phrygian cap]], or [[Pileus (hat)|pileus]], is a brimless, felt cap that is conical in shape with the tip pulled forward. The cap was originally worn by ancient Romans and Greeks. <ref>Encyclopædia Britannica [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/460407/pileus entry]</ref> The cap implies ennobling effects, as seen in its association with Homer’s [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] and the mythical twins, [[Castor and Pollux]]. The emblem’s popularity during the French Revolution is due in part to its importance in ancient Rome: its use alludes to the Roman ritual of manumission of slaves, in which a freed slave receives the bonnet as a symbol of his newfound liberty. The Roman tribune [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus]] incited the slaves to insurrection by displaying a pileus as if it were a standard. <ref>Harden, "Liberty Caps and Liberty Trees" 90</ref> The pileus cap is often red in color. This type of cap was worn by revolutionaries at the fall of the Bastille. According to the Revolutions de Paris, it became "the symbol of the liberation from all servitudes, the sign for unification of all the enemies of despotism."<ref name="autogenerated1"/> The pileus competed with the Phrygian cap, a similar cap that covered the ears and the nape of the neck, for popularity. The Phrygian cap eventually supplanted the pileus and usurped its symbolism, becoming synonymous with republican liberty. <ref name="autogenerated1"/> . 

===Liberty Tree===. 
The Liberty Tree, officially adopted in 1792, is a symbol of the everlasting Republic, national freedom, and political revolution. <ref name="autogenerated1"/> It has historic roots in revolutionary France as well as America, as a symbol that was shared by the two nascent republics. <ref>Harden, "Liberty Bells and Liberty Trees" 75–77</ref> The tree was chosen as a symbol of the French Revolution because it is a symbol of fertility in French folklore,<ref>Ozouf, "Festivals and the French Revolution" 123</ref> which provided a simple transition from revering it for one reason to another. The American colonies also used the idea of a Liberty Tree to celebrate their own acts of insurrection against the British, starting with the Stamp Act riot in 1765. <ref name=autogenerated2>Harden, "Liberty Bells and Liberty Trees" 75</ref> The riot culminated in the hanging in effigy of two Stamp Act politicians on a large elm tree. The elm tree began to be celebrated as a symbol of Liberty in the American colonies. <ref name=autogenerated2 />  It was adopted as a symbol that needed to be living and growing, along with the Republic. To that end, the tree is portrayed as a sapling, usually of an oak tree in French interpretation. <ref>Harden, "Liberty Bells and Liberty Trees" 88</ref> The Liberty Tree serves as a constant celebration of the spirit of political freedom.  . 

===Hercules===. 
The symbol of [[Hercules]] was first adopted by the [[Old Regime]] to represent the monarchy. <ref>Hunt 1984, 89. </ref>  Hercules was an ancient Greek hero who symbolized strength and power. The symbol was used to represent the sovereign authority of the King over France during the reign of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon monarchs]]. <ref name=autogenerated6>Hunt 1984, 101–102</ref>  However, the monarchy was not the only ruling power in French history to use the symbol of Hercules to declare its power.  . 

During the Revolution, the symbol of Hercules was revived to represent nascent revolutionary ideals. The first use of Hercules as a revolutionary symbol was during a festival celebrating the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly’s]] victory over federalism on 10 August 1793. <ref name=autogenerated4>Hunt 1984, 96</ref>  This Festival of Unity consisted of four stations around Paris which featured symbols representing major events of the Revolution which embodied revolutionary ideals of liberty, unity, and power. <ref name=autogenerated5>Censer and Hunt 2001, 92</ref>  The statue of Hercules, placed at the station commemorating the fall of [[Louis XVI]], symbolized the power of the French people over their former oppressors. The statue’s foot was placed on the throat of the [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]], which represented the tyranny of federalism which the new [[French First Republic|Republic]] had vanquished. <ref name=autogenerated4 />  In one hand, the statue grasped a club, a symbol of power, while in the other grasping the fasces which symbolized the unity of the French people. <ref>Hunt 1984, 97</ref>  The image of Hercules assisted the new Republic in establishing its new Republican moral system. <ref name=autogenerated5 />  Hercules thus evolved from a symbol of the sovereignty of the monarch into a symbol of the new sovereign authority in France: the French people. <ref>Hunt 1984, 103</ref>  This transition was made easily for two reasons. First, because Hercules was a famous mythological figure, and had previously been used by the monarchy, he was easily recognized by educated French observers. <ref name=autogenerated6 />  It was not necessary for the revolutionary government to educate the French people on the background of the symbol. Additionally, Hercules recalled the classical age of the Greeks and the Romans, a period which the revolutionaries identified with [[Republicanism|republican]] and [[Democracy|democratic]] ideals. These connotations made Hercules an easy choice to represent the powerful new sovereign people of France.  . 

During the more [[Reign of Terror|radical phase]] of the Revolution from 1793 to 1794, the usage and depiction of Hercules changed. These changes to the symbol were due to revolutionary leaders believing the symbol was inciting violence among the common citizens. <ref name=autogenerated3>Hunt 1984, 113</ref> The triumphant battles of Hercules and the overcoming of enemies of the Republic became less prominent. In discussions over what symbol to use for the Seal of the Republic, the image of Hercules was considered but eventually ruled out in favor of [[Marianne]]. <ref name=autogenerated3 /> Hercules was on the coin of the Republic. <ref name=autogenerated3 /> However, this Hercules was not the same image as that of the pre-Terror phases of the Revolution. The new image of Hercules was more domesticated. He appeared more paternal, older, and wiser, rather than the warrior-like images in the early stages of the French Revolution. <ref name=autogenerated3 /> Unlike his 24 foot statue in the Festival of the Supreme Being, he was now the same size as Liberty and Equality. <ref name=autogenerated3 /> Also the language on the coin with Hercules was far different than the rhetoric of pre-revolutionary depictions. On the coins the words, "uniting Liberty and Equality" were used. <ref name=autogenerated3 /> This is opposed to the forceful language of early Revolutionary rhetoric and rhetoric of the Bourbon monarchy. By 1798, the [[Council of Ancients]] had discussed the "inevitable" change from the problematic image of Hercules, and Hercules was eventually phased out in favor of an even more docile image. <ref name=autogenerated3 /> . 

==Role of women==. 
Women had no political rights in pre-Revolutionary France; they could not vote or hold any political office. They were considered "passive" citizens; forced to rely on men to determine what was best for them in the government. It was the men who defined these categories, and women were forced to accept male domination in the political sphere. <ref>Scott "Only Paradoxes to Offer" 34–35</ref> The ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', published by a group of philosophers over the years 1751–1777, summarized French male beliefs of women. A woman was a "failed man," the fetus not fully developed in the womb. "Women’s testimony is in general light and subject to variation; this is why it is taken more seriously than that of men" as opposed to men, upon whom "Nature seems to have conferred… the right to govern." In general, "men are more capable than women of ably governing particular matters". <ref>Encyclopedia "Woman"</ref> Instead, women were taught to be committed to their husbands and "all his interests… [to show] attention and care… [and] sincere and discreet zeal for his salvation." A woman’s education often consisted of learning to be a good wife and mother; as a result women were not supposed to be involved in the political sphere, as the limit of their influence was the raising of future citizens. <ref>Marquise de Maintenon, "Writings" 321</ref> . 

When the Revolution opened, some women struck forcefully, using the volatile political climate to assert their active natures. In the time of the Revolution, women could not be kept out of the political sphere; they swore oaths of loyalty, "solemn declarations of patriotic allegiance, [and] affirmations of the political responsibilities of citizenship." Throughout the Revolution, women such as [[Pauline Léon]] and her [[Society of Revolutionary Republican Women]] fought for the right to bear arms, used armed force and rioted. <ref>Dalton "Madame Roland" 262</ref> . 

Even before Léon, some liberals had advocated equal rights for women including [[women's suffrage]]. [[Marquis de Condorcet|Nicolas de Condorcet]] was especially noted for his advocacy, in his articles published in the ''Journal de la Société de 1789'', and by publishing ''De l'admission des femmes au droit de cité'' [http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/book-sum/condorcet4.html ("For the Admission to the Rights of Citizenship For Women")] in 1790.  . 

===Feminist agitation===. 
{{Main|Militant Feminism in the French Revolution}}
The March to Versailles is but one example of feminist militant activism during the French Revolution. While largely left out of the thrust for increasing rights of citizens, as the question was left indeterminate in the Declaration of the Rights of Man,<ref name="Rebel Daughters pg. 79">Rebel Daughters: Women and the French Revolution Edited by Sara E Melzer and Leslie W. Rabine pg. 79</ref> activists such as [[Pauline Léon]] and [[Anne Josephe Theroigne de Mericourt|Théroigne de Méricourt]] agitated for full citizenship for women. <ref name="Olwen W pg. 23">Women and the Limits of Citizenship in the French Revolution by Olwen W. Hufton pg. 23–24</ref> Women were, nonetheless, "denied political rights of ‘active citizenship’ (1791) and democratic citizenship (1793)."<ref name="Rebel Daughters pg. 79"/> . 

Pauline Léon, on 6 March 1792, submitted a petition signed by 319 women to the National Assembly requesting permission to form a garde national in order to defend Paris in case of military invasion. <ref name="Olwen W pg. 23"/>  Léon requested permission be granted to women to arm themselves with pikes, pistols, sabers and rifles, as well as the privilege of drilling under the French Guards. Her request was denied. <ref>Rebel Daughters by Sara E Melzer and Leslie W. Rabine pg. 89</ref>  Later in 1792, Théroigne de Méricourt made a call for the creation of "legions of amazons" in order to protect the revolution. As part of her call, she claimed that the right to bear arm would transform women into citizens. <ref>Women and the Limits of Citizenship by Olwen W. Hufton pg. 23–24</ref> . 

On 20 June 1792 a number of armed women took part in a procession that "passed through the halls of the Legislative Assembly, into the Tuilleries Gardens, and then through the King’s residence."<ref>Rebel Daughters by Sara E Melzer and Leslie W. Rabine pg. 91</ref>  Militant women also assumed a special role in the funeral of [[Jean-Paul Marat|Marat]], following his murder on 13 July 1793. As part of the funeral procession, they carried the bathtub in which Marat had been murdered as well as a shirt stained with Marat’s blood. <ref>Women and the Limits of Citizenship by Olwen W. Hufton pg. 31</ref> . 

The most radical militant feminist activism was practiced by the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women, which was founded by Léon and her colleague, Claire Lacombe on 10 May 1793. <ref>Rebel Daughters by Sara E Melzer and Leslie W. Rabine pg. 92</ref> The goal of the club was "to deliberate on the means of frustrating the projects of the enemies of the Republic." Up to 180 women attended the meetings of the Society. <ref>Deviant Women of the French Revolution and the Rise of Feminism by Lisa Beckstrand pg. 17</ref>  Of special interest to the Society was "combating hoarding [of grain and other staples] and inflation."<ref>Women and the Limits of Citizenship by Olwen W. Hufton pg. 25</ref> . 

Later, on 20 May 1793, women were at the fore of a crowd that demanded "bread and the Constitution of 1793."<ref>Gender, Society and Politics: France and Women 1789–1914 by James H. McMillan pg. 24</ref> When their cries went unnoticed, the women went on a rampage, "sacking shops, seizing grain and kidnapping officials."<ref>Gender, Society and Politics by McMillan pg. 24</ref> . 

Most of these outwardly activist women were punished for their actions. The kind of punishment received during the Revolution included public denouncement, arrest, execution, or exile. Théroigne de Méricourt was arrested, publicly flogged and then spent the rest of her life sentenced to an insane asylum. Pauline Léon and Claire Lacombe were arrested, later released, and continued to receive ridicule and abuse for their activism. Many of the women of the Revolution were even publicly executed for "conspiring against the unity and the indivisibility of the Republic". <ref>Deviant Women by Beckstrand pg. 20</ref> . 

These are but a few examples of the militant feminism that was prevalent during the French Revolution. While little progress was made toward gender equality during the Revolution, the activism of French feminists was bold and particularly significant in Paris.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} . 

===Women writers===. 
[[File:Marie-Olympe-de-Gouges.jpg|thumb|Olympe de Gouges was the author of the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]'' in 1791]]
While some women chose a militant, and often violent, path, others chose to influence events through writing, publications, and meetings. [[Olympe de Gouges]] wrote a number of plays, short stories, and novels. Her publications emphasized that women and men are different, but this shouldn’t stop them from equality under the law. In her "Declaration on the Rights of Woman" she insisted that women deserved rights, especially in areas concerning them directly, such as divorce and recognition of illegitimate children. De Gouges also expressed non-gender political views; even before the start of the terror, Olympe de Gouges addressed Robespierre using the pseudonym "Polyme" calling him the Revolution’s "infamy and shame." She warned of the Revolution’s building extremism saying that leaders were "preparing new shackles if [the French people’s liberty were to] waver." Stating that she was willing to sacrifice herself by jumping into the Seine if Robespierre were to join her, de Gouges desperately attempted to grab the attention of the French citizenry and alert them to the dangers that Robespierre embodied. <ref>De Gouges "Writings" 564–568</ref> In addition to these bold writings, her defense of the king was one of the factors leading to her execution. An influential figure, one of her suggestions early in the Revolution, to have a voluntary, patriotic tax, was adopted by the National Convention in 1789. <ref>Mousset "Women’s Rights" 49</ref> . 

[[Madame Roland]] (aka Manon or Marie Roland) was another important female activist. Her political focus was not specifically on women or their liberation. She focused on other aspects of the government, but was a feminist by virtue of the fact that she was a woman working to influence the world. Her personal letters to leaders of the Revolution influenced policy; in addition, she often hosted political gatherings of the Brissotins, a political group which allowed women to join. While limited by her gender, Madame Roland took it upon herself to spread Revolutionary ideology and spread word of events, as well as to assist in formulating the policies of her political allies. Though unable to directly write policies or carry them through to the government, Roland was able to influence her political allies and thus promote her political agenda. Roland attributed women’s lack of education to the public view that women were too weak or vain to be involved in the serious business of politics. She believed that it was this inferior education that turned them into foolish people, but women "could easily be concentrated and solidified upon objects of great significance" if given the chance. <ref>Dalton "Madame Roland" 262–267</ref> As she was led to the scaffold, Madame Roland shouted "O liberty! What crimes are committed in thy name!" Witnesses of her life and death, editors, and readers helped to finish her writings and several editions were published posthumously. While she did not focus on gender politics in her writings, by taking an active role in the tumultuous time of the Revolution, Roland took a stand for women of the time and proved they could take an intelligent active role in politics. <ref>Walker "Virtue" 413–416</ref> . 

Though women did not gain the right to vote as a result of the Revolution, they still greatly expanded their political participation and involvement in governing. They set precedents for generations of feminists to come.  . 

===Counter-revolutionary women=== . 

A major aspect of the French Revolution was the [[dechristianisation]] movement, a movement that many common people did not agree with. Especially for women living in rural areas of France, the demise of the [[Catholic Church]] meant a loss of normalcy. For instance, the ringing of Church bells resonating through the town called people to confession and was a symbol of unity for the community. <ref name="Hufton, Olwen pg. 106-107">Hufton, Olwen. Women and the Limits of Citizenship 1992 pg. 106-107</ref> With the onset of the [[dechristianisation]] campaign the Republic silenced these bells and sought simultaneously to silence the religious fervor of the majority [[Catholic]] population. <ref name="Hufton, Olwen pg. 106-107"/> When these revolutionary changes to the Church were implemented, it spawned a [[counter-revolutionary]] movement, particularly amongst women. Although some of these women embraced the political and social amendments of the Revolution, they opposed the dissolution of the Catholic Church and the formation of revolutionary cults like the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]] advocated by [[Robespierre]]. <ref>Desan pg. 452</ref> As Olwen Hufton argues, these women began to see themselves as the “defenders of faith”. <ref name="Hufton, Olwen pg. 303">Hufton, Olwen. “In Search of Counter-Revolutionary Women.” 1998 pg. 303</ref> They took it upon themselves to protect the Church from what they saw as a heretical change to their faith, enforced by revolutionaries.  . 

Counter-revolutionary women resisted what they saw as the intrusion of the state into their lives. <ref name="Hufton, Olwen pg. 104">Hufton, Olwen. Women and the Limits of Citizenship 1992 pg. 104</ref> Economically, many peasant women refused to sell their goods for [[assignats]]  because this form of currency was unstable and was backed by the sale of confiscated Church property. <ref name="Hufton, Olwen pg. 303"/> By far the most important issue to counter-revolutionary women was the passage and the enforcement of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] in 1790. In response to this measure, women in many areas began circulating anti-oath pamphlets and refused to attend masses held by priests who had sworn oaths of loyalty to the Republic. <ref name="Hufton, Olwen pg. 104"/> This diminished the social and political influence of the juring priests because they presided over smaller congregations and counter-revolutionary women did not seek them for baptisms, marriages or confession. <ref>Hufton, Olwen. “In Search of Counter-Revolutionary Women.” 1998 pg. 311</ref> Instead, they secretly hid [[nonjuring]] priests and attended clandestine traditional masses. <ref>Hufton, Olwen. Women and the Limits of Citizenship 1992 pg. 105</ref> These women continued to adhere to traditional practices such as Christian burials and naming their children after saints in spite of revolutionary decrees to the contrary. <ref>Hufton, Olwen. “In Search of Counter-Revolutionary Women.” 1998 pg. 304</ref> . 

It was this determined resistance to the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] and the [[dechristianisation]] campaigns that played a major role in the re-emergence of the Catholic Church as a prominent social institution. In fact, Olwen Hufton notes about the Counter-Revolutionary women: “for it is her commitment to her religion which determines in the post-Thermidorean period the re-emergence of the Catholic Church…”. <ref>Hufton, Olwen. “In Search of Counter-Revolutionary Women.” 1998 pg. 305</ref>  Although they struggled, these women were eventually vindicated in their bid to reestablish the Church and thereby also to reestablish traditional family life and social stability. <ref>Hufton, Olwen. Women and the Limits of Citizenship 1992 pg. 130</ref> This was seen in the [[Concordat of 1801]], which formally reinstated the Catholic Church in France. <ref>Hufton, Olwen. “In Search of Counter-Revolutionary Women.” 1998 pg. 326</ref> This act came after years of failed attempts at [[dechristianisation]] or state-controlled religion, which were thwarted in part due to the resistance of devout counter-revolutionary women. After the upheaval of the revolutionary period, the reestablishment of the Church was seen by many people as a welcome return to normalcy.  . 

==Legacy==. 
{{Main|Historiography of the French Revolution}}
The French Revolution has received enormous amounts of historical attention, both from the general public and from scholars and academics. The views of historians, in particular, have been characterized as falling along ideological lines, with disagreement over the significance and the major developments of the Revolution. <ref>Rude p. 12-4</ref> [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] argued that the Revolution was a manifestation of a more prosperous middle class becoming conscious of its social importance. <ref>Rude, p. 15</ref> Other thinkers, like the conservative [[Edmund Burke]], maintained that the Revolution was the product of a few conspiratorial individuals who brainwashed the masses into subverting the old order—a claim rooted in the belief that the revolutionaries had no legitimate complaints. <ref>Rude, p. 12</ref> Other historians, influenced by [[Marxism|Marxist]] thinking, have emphasized the importance of the peasants and the urban workers in presenting the Revolution as a gigantic [[class struggle]]. <ref>Rude, p. 17</ref> In general, scholarship on the French Revolution initially studied the political ideas and developments of the era, but it has gradually shifted towards [[social history]] that analyzes the impact of the Revolution on individual lives. <ref>Rude, p. 12-20</ref> . 

Historians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in [[human history]], and the end of the [[early modern period]], which started around 1500, is traditionally attributed to the onset of the French Revolution in 1789. <ref>Frey, Foreword</ref> The Revolution is, in fact, often seen as marking the "dawn of the [[modern history|modern era]]". <ref>Frey, Preface</ref> Within France itself, the Revolution permanently crippled the power of the [[aristocracy]] and drained the wealth of the Church, although the two institutions survived despite the damage they sustained. After the collapse of the [[First French Empire|First Empire]] in 1815, the French public lost the rights and privileges earned since the Revolution, but they remembered the participatory politics that characterized the period, with one historian commenting: "Thousands of men and even many women gained firsthand experience in the political arena: they talked, read, and listened in new ways; they voted; they joined new organizations; and they marched for their political goals. Revolution became a tradition, and [[republicanism]] an enduring option."<ref>Hanson, p. 189</ref> Some historians argue that the French people underwent a fundamental transformation in self-identity, evidenced by the elimination of privileges and their replacement by [[human rights|rights]] as well as the growing decline in social deference that highlighted the principle of equality throughout the Revolution. <ref>Hanson, 191</ref> The Revolution represented the most significant and dramatic challenge to political absolutism up to that point in history and, despite its failures, spread democratic ideals throughout Europe and ultimately the world. <ref name="RiemerSimon1997">{{cite book|last1=Riemer|first1=Neal|last2=Simon|first2=Douglas|title=The New World of Politics: An Introduction to Political Science|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gKa3FTpH49oC&pg=PA106|accessdate=18 October 2011|date=28 January 1997|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-939693-41-2|page=106}}</ref>  It had a profound impact on the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] and its ideas inspired [[Mao Zedong]] in his efforts at constructing a communist state in China. <ref>Hanson, 193</ref> .
