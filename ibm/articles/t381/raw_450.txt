A '''monarch''' is the [[person]] who heads a [[monarchy]]. This is a [[form of government]] in which a [[state (polity)|state]] or [[polity]] is ruled or controlled by an individual who typically [[inheritance|inherits]] the throne by [[Rights|birth]] and rules for [[Life tenure|life]] or until [[abdication]]. Monarchs may be [[Autocracy|autocrats]] ([[absolute monarchy]]) or [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] [[head of state|heads of state]] who exercise little or no power or only [[reserve power]], with actual [[authority]] vested in a [[parliament]] or other body ([[constitutional monarchy]]).  . 

==Etymology==. 
The word monarch is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''μονάρχης'' (from ''μόνος'', "one/singular," and ''ἄρχων'', "leader/ruler/chief") through the [[Latin]]: ''monarcha'' (mono: "one" + arch "chief")  which referred to a single, at least nominally, absolute ruler.  In current usage the word monarchy generally refers to a traditional system of hereditary rule, as elective monarchies are rare in the modern period.  . 

==Characteristics== . 

Most states have at most one monarch at any given time, although a [[regent]] may rule when the monarch is a [[Minor (law)|minor]], not present, or otherwise incapable of ruling. Two monarchs have ruled simultaneously in some countries, as in the ancient [[Greek city-state]] of [[Sparta]] or the joint sovereignty of spouses or relatives (e.g. [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] of [[Kingdom of England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], [[Peter I of Russia|Peter]] and [[Ivan V of Russia|Ivan]] of [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]], [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]] and [[Joanna of Castile|Joanna]] of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], etc.).  . 

Monarchs have various titles — [[king]] or [[Queen regnant|queen]], [[prince]] or [[princess]] (e.g. [[Sovereign Prince of Monaco]]), [[Malik]] or [[Malikah]] (e.g. Maliks of Middle eastern Mamlakahs), [[emperor]] or [[empress]] (e.g. [[Emperor of Japan]], [[Emperor of India]]), [[Shah of Iran]], [[archduke]], [[duke]] or [[grand duke]] (e.g. [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]]). '''''Prince''''' is sometimes used as a generic term to describe any monarch regardless of title, especially in older texts.  . 

Many monarchs are distinguished by [[title]]s and [[Style (manner of address)|styles]]. They often take part in certain ceremonies, such as a [[coronation]].  . 

Monarchy is associated with political or sociocultural in nature [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary rule]]; most monarchs, both historically and in the modern day, have been born and brought up within a [[royal family]] (over a period of time called a [[dynasty]]) and trained for future duties. Different systems of [[Order of succession|succession]] have been used, such as [[proximity of blood]], [[primogeniture]], and [[agnatic seniority]] ([[Salic law]]). While traditionally most monarchs have been male, female monarchs have also ruled in history; the term [[queen regnant]] refers to a ruling monarch, as distinct from a [[queen consort]], the wife of a reigning king.  . 

Some monarchies are non-hereditary. In an [[elective monarchy]], the monarch is [[election|elected]] but otherwise serves as any other monarch. Historical examples of elective monarchy include the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s (chosen by [[prince-elector]]s but often coming from the same dynasty) and the [[Royal elections in Poland|free election]] of kings of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Modern examples include the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] of [[Malaysia]] and the [[pope]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], who serves as [[Sovereign]] of the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]] and is elected to a life term by the [[College of Cardinals]].  . 

Monarchies have existed throughout the world, although in recent centuries many states have abolished the monarchy and become [[republic]]s. Advocacy of republics is called [[republicanism]], while advocacy of monarchies is called [[monarchism]]. The principal advantage of hereditary monarchy is the immediate continuity of leadership, with a usually short [[interregnum]] (as illustrated in the classic phrase "[[:The King is dead. Long live the King.|The [old] King is dead. Long live the [new] King!]]"). However, this only applies in the case of autocratic rule. In cases where the monarch serves mostly as a ceremonial figure (e.g. most modern constitutional monarchies) real leadership does not depend on the monarch.  .

A form of government may in fact be hereditary without being considered monarchy, such as [[family dictatorship]] or [[political family|political families]] present in some nominally [[democracy|democratic]] countries.  . 

==Classification==. 
A particular case is the French [[List of Co-Princes of Andorra|co-prince]] of [[Andorra]], a position held by the elected [[President of France]]. Nonetheless, he is still generally considered a monarch because of the traditional use of a monarchical title (even though Andorra is, strictly speaking, a [[diarchy]].) Similarly, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] of [[Malaysia]] is considered a monarch despite only holding the office for five years at a time. On the other hand, several [[President for Life|life-time dictators]] around the world have not been formally classified as monarchs, even if succeeded by their children, but that may be more to do with international political sensitivities than with semantics.  . 

== Succession ==. 
Hereditary succession within one family has been most common. The usual hereditary succession is based on some cognatic principles and on seniority, though sometimes merit has played a part. Thus, the most common hereditary system in feudal Europe was based on cognatic primogeniture where a lord was succeeded by his eldest son or, if he had no son, by either his brother, his daughters or sons of daughters. The system of [[tanistry]] was semi-elective and gave weight also to merits and capability.  . 

The [[Salic|Quasi-Salic]] succession provided firstly for male members of the family to succeed, and secondarily males descended from female lines. In most feudal fiefs, females (such as daughters and sisters) were allowed to succeed, should the male line fail, but usually the husband of the heiress became the real lord and most often also received the title, ''[[jure uxoris]]''. Great Britain and Spain today continue this model of succession law, in the form of [[cognatic primogeniture]]. In more complex medieval cases, the sometimes conflicting principles of [[proximity of blood|proximity]] and [[primogeniture]] battled, and outcomes were often idiosyncratic.  . 

As the average life span among the nobility increased (thanks to lords limiting their personal participation in dangerous battles, and generally improved sustenance and living conditions among the wealthy), an eldest son was more likely to reach majority age before the death of his father, and primogeniture became increasingly favoured over proximity, tanistry, seniority and election.  . 

Later, when lands were strictly divided among noble families and tended to remain fixed, ''agnatic primogeniture'' (practically the same as [[Salic Law]]) became more usual: the succession would go to the eldest son of the monarch, or, if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the nearest male relative through the male line, to the total exclusion of females.  . 

In some countries however, inheritance through the female line was never wholly abandoned, so that if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the eldest daughter and to her posterity. (This, ''cognatic primogeniture'', was the rule that let [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] become Queen.) . 

In 1980, [[Sweden]] became the first monarchy to declare ''equal primogeniture'' or ''full cognatic primogeniture'', meaning that the eldest child of the monarch, whether female or male, ascends to the throne. <ref>SOU 1977:5 ''Kvinnlig tronföljd'', p. 16. </ref> Other kingdoms (the [[Netherlands]] in 1983, [[Norway]] in 1990, [[Belgium]] in 1991 and [[Denmark]] in 2009) have since followed suit.  . 

In some monarchies, such as [[Saudi Arabia]], succession to the throne usually first passes to the monarch's next eldest brother, and only after that to the monarch's children (''agnatic seniority''). In some other monarchies (e.g. [[Jordan]]), the monarch chooses who will be his successor, who need not necessarily be his eldest son.  . 

Whatever the rules of succession, there have been many cases of a monarch being overthrown and replaced by a usurper who would then often install his own family as the ruling monarchy.  .

==Monarchs in Africa==. 
{{See|Monarchies in Africa}}
{{See|History of Africa}} . 

A series of [[Pharaoh]]s ruled [[Ancient Egypt]] over the course of three millennia (circa 3150 BC to 31 BC) until it was conquered by the [[Roman Empire]]. In the same time period several kingdoms flourished in the nearby [[Nubia]] region, with at least one of them, that of the so-called [[A-Group]] culture, apparently influencing the customs of Egypt itself.  . 

[[West Africa]] hosted the [[Kanem Empire]] (700 - 1376) and its successor, the [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]] principality which survives to the present day as a part of the Federation of [[Nigeria]].  . 

In [[East Africa]], the [[Aksumite Empire]] and later the [[Ethiopian Empire]] (1270–1974) were ruled by a series of monarchs. [[Haile Selassie]], the last Emperor of Ethiopia, was deposed in a [[communist]] [[coup]].  . 

[[Central Africa|Central]] and [[Southern Africa]] were largely isolated from other regions until the modern era, but they did later feature kingdoms like the [[Kingdom of Kongo]] (1400–1914).  . 

As part of the [[Scramble for Africa]], Europeans conquered, bought, or established African kingdoms and styled themselves as monarchs.  . 

Currently the African nations of [[Morocco]], [[Lesotho]] and [[Swaziland]] are sovereign monarchies under dynasties that are native to the continent. Places like [[St. Helena]], [[Ceuta]], [[Melilla]] and the [[Canary Islands]] are ruled by the [[Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] and the [[King of Spain]], while so-called sub-national monarchies of varying sizes can be found all over the rest of the continent e.g. the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] city-state of [[Akure Kingdom|Akure]] in south-western [[Nigeria]] is something of an elective monarchy, with its reigning [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]] having to be chosen by an electoral college of nobles from amongst a finite collection of royal princes and princesses of the realm.  . 

==Monarchs in Europe==. 
[[File:Elizabeth II greets NASA GSFC employees, May 8, 2007 edit.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Queen of United Kingdom]] (as well as [[Queen of Canada|Canada]], [[Queen of Australia|Australia]], and other [[Commonwealth realm]]s)]]
{{See|Monarchies in Europe}} . 

Prince was a common title within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], along with a number of higher titles listed below. Such titles were granted by the Emperor, while the titulation of rulers of sovereign states was generally left to their own discretion, most often choosing ''King'' or ''Queen''. Such titulations could cause [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] problems, and especially the elevation to [[Emperor]] or [[Empress]] was seen as an offensive action.  . 

During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries most small monarchies in Europe disappeared, merging to form larger entities, and so ''King'' is the most common title for male rulers and ''Queen'' has become the most common title today for female rulers.  . 

{{As of|2010}} in Europe there are twelve monarchies: seven [[monarchy|kingdom]]s, one [[grand duchy]], one [[papacy]], and two [[principalities]], as well as the [[diarchy]] of [[Andorra]].  . 

==Monarchs in Asia==. 
[[Image:Crown Prince & Princess & Emperor Showa & Empress Kojun wedding 1959-4.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Japanese emperor [[Hirohito]], Crown Prince [[Akihito]], Empress [[Empress Kōjun|Nagako]], and Crown Princess [[Michiko]], 1959]]
{{See|Monarchies in Asia}}
In China, before the abolition of the monarchy in 1912, the [[Emperor of China]] was traditionally regarded as the ruler of "[[Tianxia|All under heaven]]". "King" is the usual translation for the term ''wang'' 王, the sovereign before the [[Qin dynasty]] and during the [[Ten Kingdoms]] period. During the early [[Han dynasty]], China had a number of small kingdoms, each about the size of a [[county]] and subordinate to the Empress or Emperor of China.  . 

The Japanese monarchy is now the only monarchy to still use the title of Emperor. Between 1925 and 1979, Iran was ruled by an Emperor that used the title of "Shahanshah" (or "King of Kings" in Persian). 
[[Thailand]] and Bhutan are like the UK in that they are constitutional monarchies ruled by a King. [[Saudi Arabia]] and many other Middle Eastern monarchies are ruled by a [[Malik]] and parts of the [[United Arab Emirates]], such as [[Dubai]], are still ruled by monarchs.  . 

[[Oman]] is led by Monarch Sultan [[Qaboos bin Said Al Said]]. The [[Kingdom of Jordan]] is one of the [[Middle East]]'s more modern monarchies is also ruled by a [[Malik]]. In Arab and arabized countries, [[Malik]] (absolute King) is absolute word to render a monarch and is superior to all other titles. [[Nepal]] abolished their monarchy in 2008. Sri Lanka had a complex system of monarchies from 543BC to 1815. Between 47BC-42BC Anula of Sri Lanka became the country's first female head of state as well as Asia's first head of state.{{dubious|date=September 2010}} . 

In Malaysia's constitutional monarchy, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (The Supreme Lord of the Federation) is de facto rotated every five years among the nine Rulers of the Malay states of Malaysia (those nine of the thirteen states of Malaysia that have hereditary royal rulers), elected by Majlis Raja-Raja (Conference of Rulers). Under Brunei Darussalam's 1959 constitution, His Majesty Paduka Seri Baginda, Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzaddin Waddaulah is the head of state with full executive authority, including emergency powers, since 1962. The Prime Minister of Brunei is a title held by the Sultan of Brunei. As the prime minister, the Sultan presides over the cabinet.  . 

==Monarchs in the Americas==. 
{{See|Monarchies in the Americas}}
The concept of monarchy existed in the Americas long before the arrival of European colonialists. <ref>[http://www.carsten-rex.de/History/history.html Canada: History]</ref><ref>[http://www.macleans.ca/switchboard/article.jsp?content=20031027_68038_68038 Ferguson, Will; ''The Lost Kingdom''; ''Macleans'', October 27, 2003]</ref> When the Europeans arrived they referred to these tracts of land within territories of different aboriginal groups to be kingdoms, and the leaders of these groups were often referred to by the Europeans as Kings, particularly hereditary leaders. <ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/mi4/polcrt/4Chiefs.html The Four Indian Kings]</ref> . 

Pre-colonial titles that were used included:
* [[Cacique]] – Aboriginal [[Hispaniola]] and [[Borinquen]]
* [[Tlatoani]] – [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]]s
* [[Ajaw]] – [[Maya civilization|Maya]]
* [[Qhapaq Inka]] – [[Inca Empire|Tawuantin Suyu]] (Inca Empire)
* [[Morubixaba]] – [[Tupi people|Tupi]] tribes
* [[Sha-quan]] – King of the world used in some America Indian tribes . 

The first local monarch to emerge in North America after colonization was [[Agustín I of Mexico|Augustin I]], who declared himself [[Mexican Empire|Emperor of Mexico]] in 1822. Mexico again had an emperor, [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] from 1863 to 1867. In South America, Brazil had a Portuguese royal house ruling as emperor between 1822 and 1889, under Emperors [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]] and [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]].  . 

These American emperors were deposed due to complex issues, including pressure from the highly [[republic]]an [[United States]], which had declared it independent of the British monarch in 1776. The British, worried about U.S. colonial expansion, invasion following the [[American Civil War]], and the fact that the U.S. had aided the Mexican republican rebels in overthrowing Maximilian I, pushed for the union of the Canadian provinces into a country in 1867. With [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], Canada became a self-governing nation which was considered a kingdom in its own right,<ref>[http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/special/royalvisit/ENGLISH.pdf The Crown in Canada]</ref> though it remained subordinate to the [[United Kingdom]]; thus, [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] was monarch of Canada, but not sovereign of it. It was not until the passing of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] that Canada was considered to be under a distinct Canadian Crown, separate to that of the British, and not until 1953 that the Canadian monarch, at the time [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]], was [[Style of the Canadian Sovereign|titled by Canadian law]] as Queen of Canada.  . 

Between 1931 and 1983 nine other previous British colonies attained independence as kingdoms, all, including Canada, in a [[personal union]] relationship under a shared monarch. Therefore, though today there are legally ten American monarchs, one person occupies each distinct position.  .

==Titles and precedence==. 
{{For|commonly used names for specific monarchs|List of monarchs by nickname}} . 

The ''normal'' monarch title in Europe — ''i.e.'', the one used if the monarch has no higher title — is [[prince]] or [[princess]], by convention. As an absolute ruler, a monarch can choose a title. However, titles are usually defined by tradition and diplomatic considerations.  . 

Note that some of these titles have several meanings and do not necessarily designate a monarch. A [[Prince]] may be a person of royal blood (some languages uphold this distinction, see [[Fürst]]). A [[Duke]] may be a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Peerage|peer]]. In [[Imperial Russia]], a [[Grand Duke]] was a son or grandson of the [[Tsar]] or Tsarina. Holders of titles in these alternative meanings did not enjoy the same status as the monarchs of the same title.  . 

Within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], there were even more titles that were used occasionally for monarchs although they were normally noble; [[Margrave]], [[Count Palatine]], and [[Landgraf|Landgrave]]. A monarch with such a low title was still regarded as more important than a noble Duke.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} . 

The table below lists titles in [[order of precedence]]. According to [[protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]] any holder of a title of monarchy took precedence over all holders of a lower title. Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom]] was arguably the most powerful monarch of her time, but at banquets was seated below all the Emperors until she took the title of [[Empress of India]].  .

==Use of titles by non-sovereigns==. 
It is not uncommon that people who are not generally seen as monarchs nevertheless use monarchical titles. There are at least five cases of this:
* Claiming an existing title, challenging the current holder. This has been very common historically. For centuries, the [[British monarchy|British monarch]] used, among his other titles, the title [[King of France]], despite the fact that he had had no authority over French territory since the fifteenth century. Such as any one of the numerous [[antipope]]s who have claimed the [[Holy See]]. 
* Retaining the title of an extinct monarchy. This can be coupled with a claim that the monarchy was in fact never, or should never have been, extinct. An example of the first case is the [[Seborga|Prince of Seborga]]. Examples of the second case are several [[List of monarchs who lost their thrones or abdicated in the 20th century|deposed monarchs]] or otherwise [[pretender|pretenders to thrones of abolished monarchies]], ''e.g.,'' [[Leka, Crown Prince of Albania]] who is styled by some as the "King of The Albanians." Retaining the title of an extinct monarchy can, however, be totally free of claims of sovereignty, for example it was customary of numerous European Monarchies to include "King of Jerusalem" in their full titles. When it comes to deposed monarchs, it is customary to continue the usage of their monarchical title (''e.g.,'' [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II, King of the Hellenes]]) as a [[courtesy title]], not a constitutional office, for the duration of their lifetime. However the title then dies with them and cannot be used by anyone else unless the crown is restored constitutionally. Monarchs who have ''freely'' [[abdicate]]d lose their right to use their former title. However where a monarch abdicated under duress (''e.g.'', [[Michael I of Romania]]), it is customary to see the abdication as invalid and to treat them as deposed monarchs entitled to use their monarchical style for their lifetime. 
* Inventing a new title. This is common by founders of [[micronation]]s, and also may or may not come with a claim of sovereignty. When it does, it is disregarded by state leaders. A notable example is [[Paddy Roy Bates]], styling himself the "Prince of Sealand," but not recognized as such by any national government, thus failing at least the [[constitutive theory of statehood|constitutive condition for statehood]] (see [[Principality of Sealand|Sealand]] for a fuller discussion of his claims). Another known example is that of [[Emperor Norton|Norton I]], who invented the title "Emperor of the United States of America" and later declared himself "Protector of Mexico."
* Usage of a monarchical title by a fictional character. This is common in [[fairy tale]]s and other works geared to children, as well as works of [[fantasy]]. Examples include [[Princess Leia]] and [[Princess Summerfall Winterspring]]. 
* [[Honorific nicknames in popular music]] and other aspects of popular culture, such as "King of Rock and Roll".  .
