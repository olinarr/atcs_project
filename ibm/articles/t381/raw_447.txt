A '''hereditary dictatorship''', or '''family dictatorship''', in political science terms a '''personalistic regime''', is a form of [[dictatorship]] that occurs in a nominally or formally [[republic]]an regime, but operates in practice like an [[absolute monarchy]], in that political power passes within the dictator's family. Thus, although the key leader is a called [[president]] or [[prime minister]] rather than a [[king]] or [[emperor]], power is transmitted between members of the same family due to the overwhelming authority of the leader.  . 

A family dictatorship is different from an absolute monarchy. In the latter, the transition of power within a family is required by general law, and continues to apply to all successions in the regime. In the former, this arrangement is not required by general law. In some cases, a special law might be enacted to formally nominate one particular family member of the present leader as the successor. In other cases, the law of the state may even formally provide for elections, but control exerted by the leader on the political and electoral process ensures a hereditary succession. Furthermore, whether each succession succeeds depends on the level of authority and control of the leader. As a result, modern family dictatorships often transition into a non-familial (non-personalistic) regime after a small number of successions: usually just one, and rarely more than two.  . 

A family dictatorship is also different from other [[political family|political families]]. In the latter, informal power and influence accrued to the family enables the family to continue to hold political power, often through open and contested elections. In the former, the family uses either formal legal or political power or control to ensure a familial succession, and usually via a controlled or uncontested election, or no election at all.  . 

Because a family dictatorship exerts significant control on its succession, a successor is often determined well in advance. However, because it often lacks a formal general law basis for the succession, there are often long periods of uncertainty as to the identity of the successor. As often happens in other types of [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes which plan their own succession, after a successor is determined or short-listed, they often go through a significant period of "grooming", in which the successor gains the experiences and qualifications aimed to make him or her attain the authority necessary to lead the regime.  .

<!-- Please sort this list by the start of the first ruling period -->
*[[Roman Empire|Rome]]: [[Augustus]] (27 BCE to 14 CE) succeeded by his adopted son [[Tiberius]], succeeded by ''his'' adopted son [[Caligula]], succeeded by ''his'' uncle [[Claudius]], succeeded by ''his'' adopted son [[Nero]]. The office of the [[Roman Emperor]], although it began as a family dictatorship as defined above - that is, no general law determined succession, but solely the amassed power of the members of the family in question - became increasingly monarchical over time, especially once it was transferred between dynasties. By the time of [[Constantine I|Constantine]], the system had been effectively recognized as a hereditary monarchy, and the Empire's [[succession of states|successor]]/continuing state, the [[Byzantine Empire]], was explicitly monarchical (as evidenced by its motto, ''King of Kings Ruling Over Rulers'').  . 

*[[England]]: [[Oliver Cromwell]] (1653–1658) succeeded as [[Lord Protector]] of the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] by his son [[Richard Cromwell]] (1658–1659) .
