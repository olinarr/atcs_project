'''Canadian republicanism''' is the appreciation amongst Canadians for the replacement of the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian system]] of [[constitutional monarchy]] with a [[republic]]an form of government{{spaced ndash}}in the sense of the state headed by a [[president]]. These beliefs are expressed either individually{{spaced ndash}}generally in academic circles{{spaced ndash}}or through the country's one republican lobby group, [[Citizens for a Canadian Republic]]. Though they have no preferred model of republic, such individuals are driven by various factors: a perceived practicality of popular power being placed in the hands of an elected president, and a different manifestation of the modern nation and the independence it achieved in 1982. As with [[Monarchism in Canada|its political counterpart]], strong republicanism is not a prevalent element of contemporary Canadian society. The movement's roots precede [[Canadian Confederation]], and it has emerged from time to time in Canadian politics, but has not been a dominant force since the [[Rebellions of 1837]],<ref>{{Cite book| last=Coates| first=Colin MacMillan| title=Majesty in Canada: essays on the role of royalty| publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd.| year=2006| location=Toronto| page=11| url=http://books.google.com/?id=FhFyvhpPx8MC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false| isbn=9781550025866}}</ref> a continuation of which Canadian republicans consider their efforts to be. <ref>{{Cite book| last=White| first=Randall| date=20 May 2002| contribution=Address by Randall White, PhD, Political Science author, policy analyst and observer to the Executive Committee of Citizens for a Canadian Republic| contribution-url=http://www.canadian-republic.ca/speech_rw_3_20_02.html| editor-last=Citizens for a Canadian Republic| editor-link=Citizens for a Canadian Republic| title=About CCR > Speeches and commentary| place=Toronto| publisher=Citizens for a Canadian Republic| accessdate=16 September 2009| ref=harv}}</ref> .

==Democratic principles and governmental role==. 
[[Image:WLMackenzie1.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Lyon Mackenzie]], founder of the [[Republic of Canada]], and later advocate of Canadian annexation into the [[United States]].]]
Republicans view the Canadian monarchy as "outdated and irrelevant,"<small><ref name=Freda2003 /></small> and an undemocratic institution because the incumbent sovereign is neither elected and nor a citizen once on the throne; republicans will phrase this argument as "no Canadian citizen can become head of state." Without the democratic legitimacy they personally desire, some anti-monarchists refuse to recognize the authority of the Crown, expressing this through, for example, vandalism of royal symbols or ignoring the enforcement of traffic law by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]. <small><ref name=Freda2004 /></small> . 

===Colonial era and Confederation===. 
Reformists began to emerge in the Canadian colonies during the early 19th century and by two decades into that century had begun to cohese into organized groups, such as the [[York Central Committee]]. The idea of [[political party]] was viewed by a number of British North Americans as an innovation of the United States, being "anti-British and of a republican tendency."

After living in the US in order to avoid arrest in Canada, Mackenzie eventually became dissatisfied with the American republican system and gave up plans for revolution in the [[British North America]]n provinces, though he theorized, near the end of his life, on Canadian annexation into the United States, should enough people in the former country become disillusioned with [[responsible government]]. <small><ref name=DCBO /></small> Similarly, by 1849, Papineau was advocating the absorption of the [[Province of Canada]] (formed in 1840) into the American republic to the south. <small><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/qc/papineau/natcul/natcul1a_e.asp| last=Parks Canada| title=Manoir-Papineau National Historic site of Canada > Natural Wonders & Cultural Treasures > A Bit of History > A Chronology of the Life of Louis-Joseph Papineau| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=9 February 2009}}</ref></small> He echoed a significant minority of conservatives in Upper Canada who critiqued Canada's imitation of the [[Westminster system|British parliamentary]] [[constitutional monarchy]] as both too democratic and too tyrannical, theorizing that it simultaneously destroyed the independence of the appointed governor and legislative council, and further concentrated power in the Cabinet. Instead, these "republican conservatives" preferred the American federal-state system and the US constitution, seeing the American model of [[checks and balances]] as offering Canada a more fair and conservative form of democracy. They debated constitutional changes that included an elected governor, an elected legislative council, and a possible union with the US, within this republican framework. <small><ref>{{Cite journal| last=McNairn| first=Jeffrey L.| title=Publius of the North: Tory Republicanism and the American Constitution in Upper Canada, 1848-54| journal=Canadian Historical Review| volume=4| issue=77| pages=504–537| year=1996| issn=0008-3755| doi=10.3138/CHR-077-04-02| ref=harv}}</ref></small>

Prior to the [[Canadian Confederation|union of the Canadas]] in 1867, the [[Canadian Confederation#Fathers of Confederation|Fathers of Confederation]] unanimously chose [[constitutional monarchy]] to be the foundation of the new polity's form of government, and the elected legislatures of [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]], and the [[Province of Canada]] approved. <small><ref name=Macdonald>{{Cite book| last=Macdonald| first=John A.| author-link=John A.

===Post-Quebec sovereignty movement===. 
The [[Parti Québécois]] rose to power in Quebec on the support of nationalists, and thereafter demonstrated an attitude towards the monarchy that ranged from hostility to indifference. Republican options were discussed following the sovereigntist [[Parti Québécois]]' (PQ) election to power in Quebec, but only specifically in relation to the province;<ref name=CBCFLQ>{{cite news| url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-74-870-5019/people/rene_levesque/clip6| title=René, The Queen and the FLQ| publisher=CBC| accessdate=10 February 2009}}</ref> in February 1968, during the first meeting of the [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|Constitutional Conference]] in Ottawa, delegates from Quebec indicated that a provincial president might suit the province better than the [[Lieutenant Governor of Quebec|an appointed viceroy]]. Two years later, Parti Québécois members of the [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]] refused to recite the constitutionally mandated [[Oath of Allegiance (Canada)|Oath of Allegiance]] to the sovereign before taking their seats in the legislature,<ref name="CBCFLQ"/></small> and ''souverainistes'' complained about the Queen's role in officially opening the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Montreal Olympics]], with [[Premier of Quebec|Quebec Premier]] [[René Lévesque]] asking Elizabeth to turn down the advice of her federal prime minister, [[Pierre Trudeau]], and not open the games. <ref name=CBCFLQ /> This attitude led to the role of the monarchy in Canada coming under scrutiny during constitutional conventions in the lead up to the [[patriation]] of the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]] in 1982. <ref>{{Cite journal| last=Heinricks| first=Geoff| contribution=National Post| year=2001| title=Trudeau and the Monarchy| journal=Canadian Monarchist News| publisher=Monarchist League of Canada| publication-date=July 2001| publication-place=Toronto| issue=Winter/Spring 2001-2001| url=http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/2001/opinion.htm| accessdate=10 February 2009| ref=harv |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080622173849/http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/2001/opinion.htm |archivedate = June 22, 2008}}</ref><ref name=Smith11>{{Harvard citation| Smith| p=11}}</ref> However, proposals for change were thwarted by the provinces, including Quebec. <ref name=Phillips19 /><ref name=Smith11 /><ref>{{Cite book| last=Valpy| first=Michael| contribution=Don't Mess With Success{{spaced ndash}}and Good Luck Trying| contribution-url=http://www.irpp.org/po/archive/may99/valpy.pdf| editor-last=Watson| editor-first=William| periodical=Policy Options: Bye-Bye for Good?| issue=May 1999| pages=26| publication-place =Montreal| publisher=Institute for Research on Public Policy| url=http://www.irpp.org/po/| accessdate=17 February 2009| ref=harv}}</ref> . 

In contrast to monarchist arguments, those against the Crown assert that it is possible to have such an elected head of state be an apolitical individual, further theorizing that trends in transparency will make the result even more possible, and that he or she would not clash with the Prime Minister due to possible differences in the selection process for each office, though some desire an empowered chief executive who could hold the Cabinet in check. Others feel an appointed Canadian president would be more democratic than the Crown. <ref name=OC /> The range of often contradictory proposals highlights the fact that Canadian republicans are not fully united on what sort of republican form of government they believe the nation should adopt. The Westminster-style parliamentary republican model, which is advocated by other Commonwealth republican movements, has been embraced by Citizens for a Canadian Republic as the preferred model for Canada.

Towards that end, Citizens for a Canadian Republic proposed in March 2004 that the federal [[viceroy]] be made an elected position, as a first step towards some form of republic. As the normal channels of appointment would follow after the election, no constitutional reform would be necessary. However, as monarchists point out, the scheme does not take into consideration any provincial input, especially concerning the relationship between the provincial and federal Crowns, and thus the [[Lieutenant Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governors]]; an issue that would weigh heavily in any constitutional debate on the Crown, regardless of the selection process of the Governor General. At approximately the same time, the editors of ''The Globe and Mail'' began calling for the Governor General to be made head of state under the guise of "patriating the monarchy", and arguing that Canada could rid itself of its Crown without becoming a republic,<ref name="Senex 2007 23"/> and backing their journalist [[Jeffrey Simpson]]'s preference for the Companions of the [[Order of Canada]] to choose the head of state in a Canadian republic. <ref name=Simpson>{{Cite news| last=Simpson| first=Jeffrey| author-link=Jeffrey Simpson| last2=Valpy| first2=Michael| author2-link=Michael Valpy| title=Has the magic gone out of our monarchy?| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| pages=F6| date=13 April 2002| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/GIS.Servlets.HTMLTemplate?tf=tgam/common/FullStory.html&cf=tgam/common/FullStory.cfg&date=20020413&cache_key=internationalAfricaHeadline&current_row=4&start_row=4&num_rows=1| location=Toronto}}</ref>
Then, some weeks later, Quebec sovereignty again collided with the monarchy, when Quebec separatists threatened to mount demonstrations should the Queen be in attendance at the ceremonies for the 400th anniversary of the founding of Quebec City; Mario Beaulieu, Vice-President of the ''[[Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society|Société Saint-Jean Baptiste]]'' announced that the Queen's presence would be a catalyst for action, saying: "You can be sure that people will demonstrate in protest... We are celebrating the foundation of [[New France]], not its conquest. The monarchy remains a symbol of imperialism and colonialism. Her presence will not be welcomed", and Gérald Larose, president of the Quebec Sovereignty Council, stated that the monarchy was "the most despicable, appalling, anti-democratic, imperial, colonial symbol against which all social and individuals rights were obtained through the course of history."<ref>{{Cite news| last=Séguin| first=Rhéal| title=A birthday visit by the Queen?

As abolition of the monarchy would require a constitutional amendment made only after the achievement of unanimous consent amongst the [[Parliament of Canada|federal parliament]] and all ten [[Legislative Assemblies of Canadian provinces and territories|provincial legislatures]], republicans face difficulty in achieving their goal. <ref>{{cite journal| last=Ritchie| first=Jonathan| coauthors=Markwell, Don| title=Australian and Commonwealth Republicanism| journal=The Round Table: the Commonwealth Journal of International Affairs| volume=95| issue=5| page=733| publisher=Routledge| location=Newtownabbey| date=October 2006| issn=0035-8533| ref=harv}}</ref> Further, though republicans have pointed to Ireland and [[India]] as models that could be adapted to Canada, no specific form of republic or selection method for a president has been decided on,<ref>{{Cite news| last=Ward| first=John| title=Canadian anti-monarchists watch Aussie debate| newspaper=Toronto Star| date=10 April 2009| url=http://www.thestar.com/article/616826| accessdate=15 September 2009| ref=harv}}</ref> and the Canadian populace remains largely indifferent to the issue. <ref>{{Harvnb| Whitaker| 1999| p=12}}</ref> .

One constitutional scholar, [[Ted McWhinney]], has argued that Canada can become a republic upon the demise of the current Queen by not proclaiming a successor; according to McWhinney, this would be a way for the constitution to evolve "more subtly and by indirection, through creating new glosses on the Law of the Constitution as written, without formally amending it."<ref>{{Cite news| last=Yaffe| first=Barbara| title=Ditching royals is easy, expert says| newspaper=Vancouver Sun| date=17 February 2005| ref=harv}}</ref> However, Ian Holloway, Dean of Law at the [[University of Western Ontario]], criticised this proposal for its ignorance of provincial input, and opined that its implementation "would be contrary to the plain purpose of those who framed our system of government."<ref>{{Cite book| last=Holloway| first=Ian| year=2005| editor-last=Ed.
