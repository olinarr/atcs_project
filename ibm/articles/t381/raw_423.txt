'''[[Republicanism]] in the [[United Kingdom]]''' is the movement which seeks to remove the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarchy]] and replace it with a [[republic]] that has a non-[[hereditary]] [[head of state]]. The method by which the head of state should be chosen is not agreed upon, with some favouring an elected president, some an appointed head of state with little power, and others supporting the idea of leaving the political system as it is but without a monarch.  . 

==Context==. 
Within Great Britain republican sentiment has largely focused on the abolition of the British monarch, rather than the dissolution of the [[British unionism|British Union]] or independence for its [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent countries]].  . 

In [[Northern Ireland]], the term "republican" is usually used in the sense of [[Irish republicanism]]. While also against monarchical forms of government, Irish republicans are against the presence of the British state in ''any'' form in [[Ireland]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} and advocate creating a [[United Ireland|united]], all-island state. While this may be confusing, [[Unionism (Ireland)|unionists]] who support a British republic also exist.  . 

There are republican members of the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) in [[Scotland]] and [[Plaid Cymru]] in [[Wales]] who advocate independence for those countries as republics. The SNP's official policy is that the British monarch would remain head of state of an independent Scotland, unless the people of Scotland decided otherwise. Plaid Cymru have a similar view for Wales.  . 

==History==. 
===Cromwellian republic===. 
The [[Countries of the United Kingdom|countries]] that now make up the United Kingdom, together with the present [[Republic of Ireland]], were briefly ruled as a republic in the 17th century, first under the Commonwealth consisting of the [[Rump Parliament]] and the [[English Council of State|Council of State]], (1649–53) and then under the Protectorate of [[Oliver Cromwell]] (1653–58). The Commonwealth Parliament represented itself as a Republic on the classical model, with [[John Milton]] writing Latin justifications for use as propaganda on Continental Europe.  Cromwell's Protectorate was less ideologically republican and was seen by Cromwell as restoring the mixed constitution of monarchy, aristocracy and democracy found in classical literature and English common law discourse.  . 

First [[Kingdom of England|the Kingdom of England]] was declared to be the [[Commonwealth of England]] and then Scotland and Ireland were briefly forced in to union with England by the army. This decision was later reversed when the monarchy was restored in 1660. In 1707 the Act of Union between England and Scotland was signed; the two countries' parliaments became one, and in return Scotland was granted access to the English colonies.  . 

[[File:Cromwell as a usurper.tiff|thumb|A Dutch satirical view of Cromwell as a usurper of monarchical power]]
Many of Cromwell's actions upon gaining power were decried as "harsh, unwise, and tyrannical".{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} He and General [[Thomas Fairfax]] were often ruthless in putting down the mutinies which occurred within their own army towards the end of the civil wars (prompted by Parliament's failure to pay the troops). They showed little sympathy for the [[Levellers]], an [[egalitarian]] movement which had contributed greatly to Parliament's cause but sought representation for ordinary citizens. The Leveller point of view had been strongly represented in the [[Putney Debates]], held between the various factions of the Army in 1647, just prior to the King's temporary escape from army custody. Cromwell and the [[Grandees]] were not prepared to permit such a radical democracy and used the debates to play for time while the future of the King was being determined. [[Catholicism|Catholics]] were persecuted zealously under Cromwell, although he personally was in favour of religious toleration "liberty for tender consciences" not all his compatriots agreed. The war led to much [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|death and chaos in Ireland]] where Irish Catholics and Protestants who fought for the Royalists were persecuted. There was a ban on many forms of entertainment; as public meetings could be used as a cover for conspirators, horse racing was banned,the [[maypole]]s were famously cut down, the theatres were closed, and Christmas celebrations were outlawed for being too ceremonial, Catholic, and "popish". When [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] eventually regained the throne,in 1660, he was widely celebrated for allowing his subjects to have "fun" again.  . 

Much of Cromwell's power was due to the Rump Parliament, a Parliament purged of opposition to grandees in the [[New Model Army]]. Whereas [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] had been in part restrained by a Parliament that would not always do as he wished,(the cause of the Civil War) Cromwell was able to wield much more power as only loyalists were allowed to become [[Members of Parliament|MPs]], turning the chamber into a rubber-stamping organisation. This was ironic given his complaints about Charles I acting without heeding the "wishes" of the people. But even so he found it almost impossible to get his Parliaments to follow all his wishes. His executive decisions were often thwarted - most famously in the ending of the rule of the regional major generals appointed by himself.  . 

In 1657 Cromwell was offered the crown by Parliament, presenting him with a dilemma since he had played a great role in abolishing the monarchy. After two months of deliberation, he rejected the offer. Instead, he was ceremonially re-installed as "[[Lord Protector]]", with greater powers than he had previously held. It is often suggested that offering Cromwell the Crown was an effort to curb his power: as a King he would be obliged to honour agreements such as [[Magna Carta]], but under the arrangement he had designed he had no such restraints. This allowed him to preserve and enhance his power and the army's while decreasing Parliament's control over him, probably to enable him to maintain a well-funded army which Parliament could not be depended upon to provide.  . 

The office of Lord Protector was not formally hereditary, though Cromwell was able to nominate his own successor in his son, [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]].  . 

===Restoration of the monarchy===. 
[[File:Flag of the British Republic.svg|250px|right|thumb|Flag of a proposed "British Republic" used by [[Chartists]] and Radicals in the nineteenth century. [[Sea green]] colours were often used by the Chartists and earlier Levellers. A group of republican intellectuals used a version of this tricolour with blue at the top. The red-white-green tricolour is equal to the [[flag of Hungary]] although probably based on the symbolism of the [[Newfoundland Tricolour]] (the Red representing England, the White Scotland and the Green for Ireland).]]
Although England, Ireland and Scotland became [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]], after the reigns of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and his brother [[James II of England|James II & VII]], and with the ascension of [[William and Mary]] to the English, Irish and Scottish thrones as a result of the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, there have been movements throughout the last few centuries whose aims were to remove the monarchy and establish a republican system. A notable period was the time in the late 18th century and early 19th century when many [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicals]] such as the minister [[Joseph Fawcett]] were openly republican. <ref>White, Daniel E. (2006). ''Early Romanticism and religious dissent''. Cambridge University Press, p. 93 ISBN 978-0-521-85895-3</ref> . 

During the later years of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria's]] reign, there was considerable criticism of her decision to withdraw from public life following the death of her husband, [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Prince Albert]]. However this did not translate into clear support for republicanism. Most of the criticism was dismissed when she came out of mourning and returned to public life.  . 

Some members of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], such as [[Keir Hardie]], also held republican views. <ref>Reid, Fred. (1978) ''Keir Hardie: the making of a socialist''. Croom Helm, p. 96. ISBN 978-0-85664-624-9. </ref> . 

===Prohibition of republican advocacy===. 
Parliament passed the [[Treason Felony Act 1848|Treason Felony Act]] in 1848. This act made advocacy of republicanism punishable by [[penal transportation|transportation]] to Australia, later life imprisonment. The [[Law Lords]] ruled in 2003 that this law does not prohibit peaceful printed advocacy of anti-monarchy sentiments. <ref name=Dyer>{{Cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,985915,00.html | publisher=The Guardian | title=Guardian vindicated in treason case | author=Clare Dyer | date=27 June 2003 | location=London}}</ref> . 

===21st century===. 
The monarchy currently remains secure in the United Kingdom with [[MORI]] Polls in the opening years of the 21st century showing support for retaining the monarchy stable at around 80% of people. <ref name="Politics UK">Jones, Bill; Kavanagh, Dennis; Moran, Michael; Norton, Philip (2007). ''Politics UK.'' Pearson Education. p. 402. ISBN 1-4058-2411-5. </ref> In 2005, during the time of the [[Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker Bowles|wedding]] of [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and [[Camilla Parker Bowles]], support for the monarchy dipped slightly with one poll showing that only 65% of people would support keeping the monarchy if there were a referendum on the issue, with 22% saying they favoured a republic. <ref name="Politics UK"/> In 2009 an [[ICM (polling)|ICM]] poll, commission by the [[BBC]], found that 76% of those asked wanted the monarchy to continue after the Queen, against 18% of people who said they would favour Britain becoming a republic and 6% who said they did not know. <ref>{{Cite news|title=PM and Palace 'discussed reform' |work=BBC News |date=29 March 2009 |accessdate=29 March 2009 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7967142.stm}}</ref> In the wake of the [[United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal|2009 MP's expenses scandal]], a poll of readers of the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Observer|Observer]]'' newspapers placed support for abolition of the monarchy at 54%, although only 3% saw it as a top priority. <ref name=GuardianPoll>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/jun/03/guardian-observer-political-reform-survey|publisher=The Guardian|title=Readers give their verdict: first fix the electoral system|date=3 June 2009 | location=London | accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> . 

In February 2011, a YouGov poll put support for ending the monarchy after Queen Elizabeth's death at 13%, if Prince Charles becomes King. <ref>{{Cite news|title=Positively princely |work=YouGov |date=25 March 2011 |accessdate=3 April 2011 |url= http://today.yougov.co.uk/life/positively-princely}}</ref> However, an ICM poll shortly before the [[Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton|royal wedding]] suggested that 26% thought Britain would be better off without the monarchy, with only 37% "genuinely interested and excited" by the wedding. <ref>{{Cite news|title=Poll shows support for Royal Family |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 April 2011 |accessdate=30 April 2011 |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/feedarticle/9612583 |location=London}}</ref> . 

==Supporters==. 
===Political parties===. 
At present, none of the three major British political parties have an official policy of republicanism. However, there are a number of individual politicians who favour abolition of the monarchy. [[Tony Benn]] of the [[British Labour Party|Labour Party]] introduced a [[Commonwealth of Britain Bill]] in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in 1991. Other republican politicians include Labour members [[Roy Hattersly]], [[Dennis Skinner]] and [[John Prescott]]; Welsh [[Member of the National Assembly for Wales|AM]] [[Leanne Wood]] of [[Plaid Cymru]]; and [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] [[Julian Huppert]] and [[Norman Baker]].  . 

The largest party with an official policy of republicanism is currently the [[Green Party of England and Wales]], with one MP in the House of Commons.  . 

The [[Scottish Socialist Party]] advocates the [[independence of Scotland]] as a republic, organising the republican rally at [[Declaration of Calton Hill|Calton Hill]] on the official opening of [[Scottish Parliament|Holyrood]] by the Queen.  . 

The [[Alliance for Green Socialism]] campaigns for abolishing the monarchy and the creation of a presidential system, similar to the Republic of Ireland.  . 

===Individuals===. 
Outside Parliament, well-known contemporary republicans include Professor [[Richard Dawkins]];<ref name=rep>[http://www.republic.org.uk/Who%20we%20are/Our%20Supporters%20Include/index.php Our Supporters Include...]. [[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]]. </ref> actress [[Honor Blackman]];<ref name=rep/> writer [[Johann Hari]];<ref name=rep/> film directors [[Paul Greengrass]],<ref name=rep/> [[Mike Leigh]]<ref name=rep/> and [[Ken Loach]];<ref name=rep/> authors [[Michael Rosen]]<ref name=rep/> and [[Benjamin Zephaniah]];<ref name=rep/> and [[Michael Mansfield]], [[Queen's Counsel|QC]]. <ref name=rep/> . 

===Lobby groups===. 
{{Main|Republic (political organisation)}}
The largest lobby group in favour of republicanism in the United Kingdom is the [[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]] campaign group, founded in 1983. The group has benefited from recent negative publicity about the Royal Family, and Republic has reported a large rise in membership since the wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles. In June 2006 the group handed in a petition of over 3,000 names to [[10 Downing Street]] calling for a serious national debate about the future of the monarchy.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  Since then Republic has lobbied on changes to the parliamentary oath of allegiance, royal finances and changes to the Freedom of Information Act relating to the monarchy, none of which have produced any change.  . 

In 2009 Republic made news by reporting Prince Charles's architecture charity to the Charity Commission (the Commission declined to take the matter further) and has previously broken stories about royals using the Freedom of Information Act.  The organisation is regularly called up to comment and provide quotes for the press, national and local radio and national TV programmes.  . 

Republic is constituted as a limited company and run by its members, employing staff to carry out the day to day activities.  . 

Republic's aim is "to mount a successful campaign to persuade a majority of voters to support the replacement of hereditary monarchy with a democratic republican constitution."  It sees the abolition of the monarchy as the key reform needed to allow Britain to reform other areas of the constitution.  It also has a policy in favour of a fully elected upper house to replace the House of Lords.  . 

==Arguments in favour of a republic==. 
{{refimprove|date=November 2010}} . 

===The benefits of a republic===. 
Republicans argue that republicanism is the next logical step toward a fully democratic constitution which answers a number of key issues.  . 

[[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]] argue: {{cquote2|The monarchy is not only an unaccountable and expensive institution, unrepresentative of modern Britain, it also gives politicians almost limitless power.  . 

It does this is in a variety of ways: . 

* [[Royal Prerogative]]: Former royal powers that allow the Prime Minister to declare war or sign treaties (amongst other things) without a vote in Parliament.  . 

* The [[Privy Council]]: A body of advisors to the monarch, now mostly made up of senior politicians, which can enact legislation without a vote in Parliament.  . 

* The [[Crown in Parliament|Crown-in-Parliament]]: The principle, which came about when parliament removed much of the monarch's power, by which Parliament can pass any law it likes - meaning our liberties can never be guaranteed. <ref name=want/>}} . 

Republicans also want to see a constitution that they claim will inspire aspiration (by allowing anyone to become head of state) and political responsibility (by introducing popular sovereignty, the notion that the people are 'in charge'). They also claim that they want what's 'best for Britain', which includes the best democracy. <ref name=case>{{cite web|url=http://www.republic.org.uk/What%20we%20want/In%20depth/The%20Case%20for%20a%20Republic/index.php|title=The case for a republic|publisher=[[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]]|accessdate=1 May 2011}}</ref> . 

===Arguments against monarchy===. 
A significant number of republicans assert that hereditary monarchy is unfair and elitist. They claim that in a modern and democratic society no one should be expected to defer to another simply because of his birth. Such a system, they assert, does not make for a society which is at ease with itself, and it encourages attitudes which are more suited to a bygone age of imperialism than to a "modern nation". Some claim that maintaining a privileged royal family diminishes a society and encourages a feeling of dependency in many people who should instead have confidence in themselves and their fellow citizens. <ref name=case/> . 

Further, republicans argue that 'the people', not the members of one family, should be sovereign. <ref name=case/> . 

* '''Monarchy contradicts democracy'''
** '''Monarchy denies ''the people'' a basic right''' – Republicans believe that it should be a fundamental right of the people of any nation to elect their head of state and for every citizen to be eligible to hold that office. It is argued such a head of state is more accountable to the people, and that such accountability to the people creates a better nation. <ref>Hames, Tim; Leonard, Mark (1998). ''Modernising the monarchy.'' Demos. p. 22. ISBN 978-1-898309-74-1. </ref>
** '''Monarchy devalues a parliamentary system''' – Monarchical prerogative powers can be used to circumvent normal democratic process with no accountability, and such processes are more desirable than not for any given nation-state. <ref name=want>{{cite web|url=http://www.republic.org.uk/What%20we%20want/index.php|title=What we want|publisher=[[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]]|accessdate=30 April 2011}}</ref> . 

* '''Monarchy is ethnic-discrimination'''
By virtue of their narrow breeding mechanisms, most monarchs belong to a clearly identifiable ethnic group. Thus, members of other ethnic groups are forever denied a head of state they can directly relate to.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} This phenomenon produces divided societies where one ethnic group can, openly or discreetly, boast about their ethnic link to the royal family and derive from it a sense of superiority. In ethnically homogeneous countries, this has little effect. However in multi-ethnic countries, this can be become extremely divisive and the historical record of constitutional monarchy ability to maintain national unity, in the face of multi-ethnic tensions, is not good.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} . 

* '''Monarchy is gender-discriminative'''
The British Royal Family has, until now, used male [[primogeniture]], which has meant that the crown has been inherited by the eldest son, and has only passed on to a daughter if the monarch has had no sons. In October 2011 it was announced that succession laws in the UK and in other [[Commonwealth realm]]s would be changed so that sons of any future monarch would no longer be preferred over daughters. However, this change has been described as "crass and absurd" because, despite being portrayed as greater equality, it does nothing to stop the discrimination "against any man, woman and child who isn't born into the Windsor family". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://republic.org.uk/What%20we%20want/In%20the%20news/?command=fe_show_press_release&press_release_id=370&date__date__year=&date__date__month=&date__date__day=|title=Succession Act changes 'fail equality test in practice and in principle': Republic|publisher=[[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]]|accessdate=29 October 2011}}</ref> . 

* '''A monarchy demands deference'''
It is argued by republicans that the way citizens are expected to address members, however junior, of the royal family is part of an attempt to keep subjects 'in their place'. <ref>Bertram, Christopher (2004). ''Routledge philosophy guidebook to Rousseau and The social contract.'' Routledge. p. 160. </ref> . 

* '''It is the enemy of merit and aspiration'''
The order of succession in a monarchy specifies a person who will become head of state, regardless of qualifications. The highest titular office in the land is not open to "free and fair competition".{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Although monarchists argue that the position of Prime Minister, the title with real power, is something anyone can aspire to become, the executive and symbolically powerful position of Head of State is not.  . 

* '''It devalues intellect and achievement'''
Republicans argue that members of the royal family bolster their position with unearned symbols of achievement. Examples in the UK include the Queen's many honorary military titles of colonel-in-chief, regardless of her military experience. <ref>[[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom#Honorary military appointments|Queen Elizabeth II's Military titles]]</ref> There is debate over the roles the members of the monarchy have played in the military, many doubt that members of the royal family took any part on the front line for any length of time, with the clear exceptions of Prince Andrew, who served as a line helicopter pilot in the [[Falklands War]] and was almost shot down <ref>History of the Falklands War, BBC Documentary and interview with Price Andrew and his commanding officer</ref> and Prince Harry, who fought in Afghanistan <ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7269743.stm | work=BBC News | title=Prince Harry on Afghan front line | date=28 February 2008}}</ref> It is seen to some as more of a PR exercise than military service. Members of the royal family are fast-tracked to higher ranks in the army.  . 

* '''It harms the monarchs themselves'''
Republicans argue that a hereditary system condemns each heir to the throne to an abnormal childhood. This was historically the reason why the anarchist [[William Godwin]] opposed the monarchy.  [[Johann Hari]] has written a book ''God Save the Queen?'' in which he argues that every member of the royal family has suffered psychologically from the system of monarchy. <ref>[http://www.johannhari.com/archive/article.php?id=603 Johann Hari – Archive]</ref> . 

*'''Monarchs are not impartial, and lack accountability'''
Republicans argue that monarchs are not impartial but harbour their own opinions, motives, and wish to protect their interests. Republicans claim that monarchs are not ''accountable''. As an example, republicans argue that [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] has spoken and acted in ways that have widely been interpreted as taking a political stance, citing his refusal to attend, in protest of China's dealings with [[Tibet]], a state dinner hosted by the Queen for the Chinese head of state; his strong stance on GM food; and the contents of certain memos which were leaked to the press regarding how people achieve their positions. <ref name="charles-tibet">{{cite web|url=http://www.tibet.ca/en/wtnarchive/2002/9/26_5.html| title=Tibet News Network: Charles furore grows with Tibet missive| accessdate=1 September 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060928002250/http://www.tibet.ca/en/wtnarchive/2002/9/26_5.html |archivedate = 28 September 2006}}</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2280564.stm Palace defends prince's letters].

Republicans see a lack of important democratic accountability and transparency for such institutions.  . 

*'''The monarchy is expensive'''
Republicans claim that the total costs to taxpayers including hidden elements (e.g., the Royal Protection security bill) of the monarchy are over £100&nbsp;million per annum. <ref>[http://www.republic.org.uk/news/?command=fe_show_press_release&press_release_id=89&date_year=&date_month=&date_day=&headline=&body= Republic Organization Challenges Queen's Finances]</ref> ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' claims the monarchy costs each adult in Britain around 62p a year. <ref name='R000062'>{{Cite news| first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Britain should get rid of the monarchy, says UN | date=14 June 2008 | publisher= | url =http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/theroyalfamily/2122182/Britain-should-get-rid-of-the-monarchy,-says-UN.html | work =[[The Daily Telegraph]] | author = Allen, Nick | accessdate = 28 September 2008 | location=London}}</ref> However, this figure does not take into account royal security, nor the money paid by regional councils to fund the costs of visits by members of the Royal Family, and assumes the "official" figure of £34m per annum to be divided between every man, woman and child in the land. Republic also argues that the Royal finances, which are  exempt from the Freedom of Information Act, are shrouded in secrecy and should be subject to greater scrutiny. Although monarchists argue that this does not take into account the 'hereditary revenues' which generated £190.8&nbsp;million for the treasury in 2007-2008, republicans assert that the Crown Estate, from which these revenues are derived, is national and State property, and that the monarch cannot surrender what they have never owned. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.republic.org.uk/What%20we%20want/In%20depth/Royal%20finances/index.php|title=Royal Finances|publisher=[[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]]|accessdate=1 May 2011}}</ref> The monarchy is estimated to cost British taxpayers £202.4m, when costs such as security are included, making it the most expensive monarchy in Europe and 112 times more expensive than the [[President of Ireland|presidency of the Republic of Ireland]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://republic.org.uk/What%20we%20want/In%20depth/Royal%20finances/index.php|title=Royal Finances|publisher=[[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]]|accessdate=6 July 2011}}</ref> The argument that tourism benefits from the continued existence of the British monarchy is refuted by Republic, who suggest that the reverse may actually be true - if the palaces were open throughout the year, tourists would be better able to visit them (as has happened with the Tower of London)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://republic.org.uk/What%20we%20want/In%20depth/Tourism/index.php|title=Tourism|publisher=[[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]]|accessdate=6 July 2011}}</ref> . 

*'''The monarchy makes the UK appear 'backwards''''
Republicans argue that the monarchy is to be considered embarrassing: as a concept it is archaic, too reminiscent of medieval feudalism, and while the UK has a hereditary head of state it cannot claim to be a modern nation. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Blain|first=Neil|coauthors=O'Donnell, Hugh|title=Media, monarchy and power|publisher=Intellect Books|year=2003|page=40|isbn=978-1-84150-043-0}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Long|first=Phil|coauthors=Palmer, Nicola J.|title=Royal tourism: excursions around monarchy|publisher=Channel View Publications|year=2007|pages=3–4|isbn=978-1-84541-080-3}}</ref> . 

==Arguments in favour of constitutional monarchy==. 
{{Refimprove|date=September 2010}}
*'''Monarchy can be complementary to rather than a replacement for democracy'''
Some argue that the current system is still democratic as the Government and MPs of Parliament are elected by universal suffrage and as the Crown acts only on the advice of the Parliament, the people still hold power. Monarchy only refers to how the head of state is chosen and not how the Government is chosen. It is only undemocratic if the monarchy holds meaningful power, which it currently does not as government rests with Parliament.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} . 

* '''Provides a safeguard against government instability'''
Some argue that the Monarch's constitutional position (with the little-used power to dissolve or refuse a government) could safeguard against Britain ever becoming a dictatorship.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Examples of this include the [[Manoonkrit Roopkachorn#Attempted coup of 1981|1981 April Fool's Day Coup]] in [[Thailand]] and the [[23-F|El Tejerazo coup]] in [[Spain]] when [[Bhumibol Adulyadej|King Bhumibol]] and [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos I]] respectively stepped in to restore democracy in their countries.  . 

* '''Safeguards the constitutional rights of the individual'''
The [[British constitution]]al system proscribes limits on Parliament and separates the executive from direct control over the police and courts. Constitutionalists argue <ref>British Monarchist League, http://www.monarchist.org.uk/constitutional-monarchy.html 6th July 2011</ref> that this is because contracts with the monarch such as the [[Magna Carta]], the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Declaration of Rights]], the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]] and the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] place obligations on the state and <ref>The Baronage Press Ltd, http://www.baronage.co.uk/bphtm-01/const-01.html 6th July 2011</ref> confirm its citizens as sovereign beings. These obligations are re-affirmed at every monarch's coronation. These obligations, whilst at the same time placing limits on the power of the judiciary and the police, also confirm those rights which are intrinsically part of British and especially English culture <ref>House of Commons Library, http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-00293.pdf. 6th July 2011</ref> Examples are [[Common Law]], the particular status of ancient practices, [[jury trial]]s, legal [[precedent]], protection against non-judicial seziure and the [[right to protest]]. Removal of the monarchy would unravel this delicate framework of political checks and balances, tested and modified over centuries, which recognise rights of the individual [[British citizen]] which cannot be found in The [[European Convention on Human Rights]] nor in most other countries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} . 

* '''Provides an impartial arbiter'''
Monarchists argue that an impartial, symbolic head of state is a step removed from political, commercial, and factional interests, allowing them to be a non-partisan figure who can act as an effective intermediary between various levels of government and political parties, an especially indispensable feature in a [[Federation|federal]] system.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The fact that the monarch nominally holds all executive authority is seen as advantageous by monarchists, who state that [[the Crown]] is a guarantor against the misuse of constitutional power by politicians for personal gain.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} This view of the monarchy could have{{Or|date=September 2010}} developed after [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s Republic which eventually became a military dictatorship. Monarchists assert that honours systems like the [[French Legion of Honour]] may not be as politically impartial as they feel that a monarch is.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} . 

* '''Provides a focal point for unity and tradition'''
Monarchists argue that a [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarch]] with limited powers and non-partisan nature can provide a focus for national unity, national awards and honours, national institutions, and allegiance, as opposed to a president affiliated to a political party. <ref>Bogdanor, V. (1997). The Monarchy and the Constitution. ch11</ref> . 

* '''Provides continuity and stability'''
Monarchists argue that having a long serving monarch would increase the sense of duty and continued stability of a nation as the monarch would not have to worry about staying in power or elections every few years and be solely focused on their duties.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} They would also be more familiar with their position as they would have had many years to prepare for it and they would meet more people and gain knowledge and respect throughout the world.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The Queen is one of the most recognised people in the world whilst presidents and politicians are often forgotten after they leave office or are unheard of to other countries of the world whilst in office.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} . 

* '''The Royals promote the image of the United Kingdom worldwide'''
Monarchists argue that a figurehead detached from the government enables the UK to reach out and connect to other countries across the world because political ideology alone within a republic can isolate the country.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} . 

* '''Tourism'''
Monarchists argue that the monarchy is an impetus for significantly greater national income from tourism because many tourists come to the United Kingdom to see the palaces and other institutions such as the [[Coldstream Guards]] that are central to the monarchy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} . 

* '''If there was a republic, the costs will remain the same'''
Some argue that if there was a republic, the costs incured in regards to the duties of the head of state would remain more or less the same. This includes the upkeep and conservation of the royal palaces and buildings which would still have to be paid for as they belong to the nation as a whole rather than the monarch personally. On top of that, the head of state would require a salary and security, state visits, banquets and ceremonial duties would still go ahead. In 2009, the monarchy claimed to be costing each person an estimated 69 pence a year (not including "a hefty security bill"). <ref>Robert Hardman, Daily Mail, http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1228747/The-Queen-parasite-No-penny-pinching-paragon-rotten-MPs-note.html 6th July 2011</ref><ref>The Star, http://www.thestar.com/blogs/article/943470--the-prince-the-dukedom-and-jack-the-ripper 6th July 2011</ref><ref>The Press Secretary to the Queen, The British Monarchy website, http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Pressreleases/2009/HeadofStateExpenditure29June2009.aspx 6th July 2011</ref> However, the figure of 69p per person has been criticised for having been calculated by dividing the overall figure by approximately 60 million people, rather than by the number of British taxpayers. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8124022.stm|title=Cost of Royal Family rises £1.5m|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref> . 

* '''A British Republic has already been tested and failed'''
Even though no modern republicans advocate a republic modelled on Cromwell's Protectorate, some <ref>David Plant, The Rump Parliament, British Civil Wars and Commonwealth website
http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/glossary/rump-parliament.htm 6th July 2011</ref> point out that a Republican [[Commonwealth of England]], Ireland and Scotland has already been tried when [[Oliver Cromwell]] installed it on 30 January 1649. Yet by February 1657 some people <ref>A group of MPs headed by Lord Broghill, David Plant, Biography of Oliver Cromwell, British Civil Wars and Commonwealth website http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/biog/oliver-cromwell.htm 6th July 2011</ref> argued that Cromwell should assume [[the crown]] as it would stabilise the constitution, limit his powers and restore [[precedent]]. Cromwell declined. Within three years of his death the Republic had lost support and the monarchy was restored. Later, during [[The Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 caused partially by disillusionment with the absolutist rule of the Scottish [[James II of England]] (VII of Scotland), Parliament and others <ref>The philosopher John Locke, 'John Locke Natural Rights to Life, Liberty, and Property', Jim Powell, senior fellow, Cato Institute, http://www.thefreemanonline.org/featured/john-locke-natural-rights-to-life-liberty-and-property/ 6th July 2011</ref> argued that James had broken "the original contract" with the state. Far from pressing for a republic, which had been experienced within living memory, they instead argued that the best form of government was a [[constitutional monarchy]] with explicitly circumscribed powers.  . 

==Other considerations==. 
===Meritocracy vs aristocracy===. 
The heir-apparent to the throne, [[Prince Charles]], has been criticised for writing a private memo on ambition and opportunity. <ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4035181.stm | work=BBC News | title=The rise of the meritocracy | date=23 November 2004 | accessdate=22 May 2010 | first=Jonathan | last=Duffy}}</ref> This memo was later leaked, and widely understood to criticise [[meritocracy]] for creating a competitive society, which republicans took as proof that the head aristocrat, and symbol of monarchy, was attacking meritocracy and the motivation of the common man towards greater achievement. In humorist [[Lynn Truss]]'s critique of British manners entitled ''Talk to the hand'',<ref>Carlton, Royce ''Talk to the Hand: The Utter Bloody Rudeness of the World Today, or Six Good Reasons to Stay Home and Bolt the Door''. Gotham: 8 November 2005. ISBN 1-59240-171-6. </ref> Charles's memo is evaluated with respect to the putative impact of meritocracy on British boorishness.  . 

The British aristocratic system is not however entirely inherited.  Honours and titles are bestowed by the monarch in recognition of service to the state (example: scientist [[Susan Greenfield, Baroness Greenfield]]) thus demonstrating aspects of meritocracy within the monarchical model. In 1917, [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] created the OBE ([[Order of the British Empire]]) to recognize services to the nation made by commoners (anyone who is not a Peer in their own right or the Sovereign.) .
