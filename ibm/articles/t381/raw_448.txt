A '''federal monarchy''' is a [[federation]] of [[federated state|states]] with a single monarch as over-all head of the federation, but retaining different monarchs, or a non-monarchical system of government, in the various states joined to the federation.  . 

==As a term in political science==. 
The term was introduced into English political and historical discourse by [[Edward Augustus Freeman]], in his ''History of Federal Government'' (1863). Freeman himself thought a federal monarchy only possible in the abstract. <ref>E.A. Freeman, ''History of Federal Government'', pp. 96-100. Available on [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9FYMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA98&dq=%22federal+Monarchy%22#PPA100,M1 google books]. </ref> . 

==Federal monarchies==. 
===Historically===. 
Historically an important example of a federal monarchy is the [[German Empire]] of 1871-1919. The head of state of the federation was a monarch, the emperor, who was also head of state of some constituent parts to the federation as king of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], while other constituent kingdoms, such as the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], [[Kingdom of Saxony]] or [[Kingdom of Württemberg]], retained their own monarchs and armies. Besides the altogether 23 monarchies federated to the empire there were three republican [[city-state]]s, namely [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Free City of Lübeck|Lübeck]], and [[Alsace-Lorraine]], a semi-autonomous republic since 1912.  . 

The [[Umayyad Caliphate]] (661-750 AD) is also considered one of the most important federal empires that ruled very early. It is sometimes considered to be the first federal empire ever known. This empire, under the rule of the [[caliph]], annexed smaller monarchies like [[Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Persia]], [[Afghanistan]], [[North Africa]], [[Morocco]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]] and parts of [[Turkey]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Turkmenistan]]. Each of those smaller monarchies is ruled by its own ruler who submits to the grand rule of the caliph. The [[Umayyad Empire]] was ranked the fifth largest contiguous empire ever to exist. At its maximum expansion, it covered more than five million square miles rendering it one of the largest empires ever known to humanity.   . 

The concept played a role in political debates in Italy and Austria-Hungary in the nineteenth century and in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] in the twentieth century, without ever being put into effect in any of these cases.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} . 

The [[Union of South Africa]], the historic predecessor to the present-day [[Republic of South Africa]], was a federal monarchy from its founding in 1910 to it conversion to a republic in 1961.  . 

===Currently===. 
In recent years the [[Kingdom of Belgium]] and the [[Kingdom of Spain]] have been referred to as federal monarchies, although neither are officially styled as such. <ref>Ronald L. Watts, ''Comparing Federal Systems''. McGill-Queen's University Press, 2003. ISBN 0889118353</ref> [[Canada]] and [[Australia]] are also federal monarchies, and both share [[Elizabeth II|the same individual]] as their respective sovereign. <ref>{{Citation| last=Victoria| author-link=Victoria of the United Kingdom| publication-date=29 March 1867| title=Constitution Act, 1867| series=Preamble| publication-place=Westminster| publisher=Queen's Printer| url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/ca_1867.html| accessdate=21 May 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Citation| last=Victoria| author-link=Victoria of the United Kingdom| publication-date=9 July 1900| title=Commonwealth Of Australia Constitution Act| series=Preamble| publication-place=Westminster| publisher=Queen's Printer| url=http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/general/constitution/preamble.htm| accessdate=21 May 2009}}</ref> . 

Currently the term can be applied in the fullest sense to [[Malaysia]]<ref>[http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/constitutional_law/is_malaysia_an_islamic_state_.html?date=2007-12-01 Tommy Thomas, "Is Malaysia an Islamic State?" 2005.]</ref> and the [[United Arab Emirates]], in both of which the head of state of the federation is selected from among the heads (sultans or emirs respectively) who rule the [[constituent state]]s of the federation.  .
