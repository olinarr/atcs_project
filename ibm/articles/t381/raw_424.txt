'''Debate between monarchists and republicans in Canada''' has been taking place since before [[Canadian Confederation|the country's Confederation]] in 1867, though it has rarely been of significance since the [[rebellions of 1837]]. <ref>{{Cite news| last=Smith| first=David| contribution=Republican Tendencies| contribution-url=http://www.irpp.org/po/archive/may99/smith.pdf| editor-last=Watson| editor-first=William| periodical=Policy Options: Bye-Bye for Good?| issue=May 1999| page=8| publication-place =Montreal| publisher=Institute for Research on Public Policy| url=http://www.irpp.org/po/| accessdate=10 February 2009}}</ref> Open support for republicanism only came from the ''[[Patriote movement|Patriotes]]'' in the early 19th century, the [[Red River Colony|Red River Métis]] in 1869, and minor actions by the [[Fenian]]s throughout the 19th century. However, paralleling the changes in constitutional law that saw the creation of a legally distinct [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian monarchy]] shared with the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, the emergence in the 1960s of [[Quebec nationalism]], and the evolution of [[Canadian nationalism]], the cultural role and relevance of the monarchy altered and was sometimes questioned in certain circles, while continuing to receive support in others.  . 

It has been estimated that only 0.6% of the population is actively engaged in any debate about a republic. <ref name=Hanon>{{Cite news| last=Hanon| first=Andrew| title=Monarchists, republicans square off| newspaper=Edmonton Sun| date=20 May 2005| url=http://www.edmontonsun.com/News/Columnists/Hanon_Andrew/2005/05/20/pf-1048971.html| accessdate=17 February 2009}} {{Dead link|date=May 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The [[Monarchist League of Canada]]'s chief executive officer, Robert Finch, stated the greatest threat to the  monarchy is not republicanism, "it is indifference."<ref name=stayhome/> .

In the early 19th century, reform-minded groups began to form in the British colonies in Canada; from them rose [[William Lyon Mackenzie]], who, along with [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]], was the first prominent proponent of a republican Canada. Their causes were countered by the Lieutenant Governors and Executive Council members at the time, as well as a majority of the colonists, who did not espouse a break with the Crown,<ref name=Philips>{{cite journal| last=Philips| first=Stephen| title=The Emergence of a Canadian Monarchy: 1867-1953| journal=Canadian Monarchist News| volume=7| issue=4| pages=1–2| publisher=Monarchist League of Canada| location=Toronto| date=Summer 2003| url=http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/2003/CMN_summer_2003_Update-11.pdf| accessdate=8 February 2009| ref=harv}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> and the rebellions ultimately failed.  . 

In the lead-up to [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867, there was debate over whether the new polity should adopt a republican or monarchical form of government. <ref>{{Cite book| last=Chevrier| first=Marc| contribution=Our Republic in America| editor-last=Venne| editor-first=Michel| title=Vive Quebec!: new thinking and new approaches to the Quebec nation| publisher=James Lorimer & Company| year=2001| location=Toronto| page=87| url=http://books.google.com/?id=xyNlYxdpdfcC&printsec=frontcover&q=| isbn=9-7815-5028-7349}}</ref> . 

[[Alistair Horne]] observed in the late 1950s that, while Canada's cultural mix grew, the monarchy remained held in high regard: "At its lowest common denominator, to the average Canadian{{mdash}} whether of British, French or Ukrainian extraction{{mdash}} the Crown is the one thing that he has that the rich and mighty Americans have not got. It makes him feel a little superior." However, at the same time, he noted that the institution was coming more into question in Quebec and that it was sometimes perceived as having a "colonial taint", but theorises that this was because Canadians had an inferiority complex in relation to the British. <ref>{{Cite book| last=Horne| first=Alistair| author-link=Alistair Horne| publication-date=2007| editor-last=Cohen| editor-first=Andrew| editor-link=Andrew Cohen| title=The Unfinished Canadian| page=42| place=Toronto| publisher =McClelland & Stewart| url=http://books.google.com/?id=glcBcaMC6doC&lpg=PP1&dq=Andrew%2C%20Cohen%20(2007).%20The%20Unfinished%20Canadian.&pg=PA90#v=onepage&q=Andrew,%20Cohen%20(2007).%20The%20Unfinished%20Canadian.| isbn=978-0771022869| date=2008-11-04| ref=harv| postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> . 

Controversy arose in the run-up to the Queen's 1959 visit, when [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] personality [[Joyce Davidson]], while being interviewed by [[Dave Garroway]] on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]'', said that as an "average Canadian" she was "pretty indifferent" to the Queen's forthcoming visit. Davidson was lambasted in the Canadian press and by many indignant Canadians for her comment. <ref>{{Cite book| last=Buckner| first=Phillip| publication-date=2005| contribution=The Last Great Royal Tour: Queen Elizabeth's 1959 Tour to Canada| editor-last=Buckner| editor-first=Phillip| title=Canada and the End of Empire| page=85| publication-place=Vancouver| publisher=UBC Press| isbn=0-7748-0915-9| url=http://books.google.com/?id=27IggObUC9kC&printsec=frontcover&q=| accessdate=24 October 2009| year=2005| ref=harv| postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> . 

Debates over the monarchy and its place in Canada also took place through the 1960s and 1970s, following the rise of [[Quebec nationalism]]. Republican options were discussed following the sovereigntist [[Parti Québécois]]' (PQ) election to power in Quebec, but only specifically in relation to the province.{{#tag:ref|In an interview in [[Saskatchewan]], and in response to a question on the role of the monarchy in a sovereign Quebec, René Lévesque responded: "Are you joking?

===1970===. 
When constitutional amendments were being considered in the 1960s, the role of the monarchy was not strenuously questioned, as it was deemed to be "no great priority in the present round of constitutional changes."<ref name=ECF /> This statement was reflected in the four opinion polls conducted in 1970, which showed that the monarchy was favoured by two thirds of those questioned. The Canadian Institute of Public Opinion asked nationally: "Do you think Canada should continue to pay allegiance to The Queen, or do you think we should become a republic with an elected president?" To this, 50% opted for retention of the ''status quo'', 33% favoured a republic, and the remainder declined to answer. Further, the answers differed by region: in Quebec, 46% wished for a republic as against 23% for monarchy, while in Ontario the monarchy was favoured well above the national average, and support was even higher in the western provinces. Older persons (over 50 years) were the strongest advocates for the monarchy than any other [[Demographic profile|age group]], although those in their 20s also gave their preference for the Crown. Similarly, another poll that year revealed that in Canada, exclusive of Quebec, the monarchy was of no issue to 37% of the populace, and a further 41% rated themselves as loyalists, although many of the older responders "recognised that youth had different ideas which might have an effect in the future."<ref name=ECF /> .
