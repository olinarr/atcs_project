'''Political corruption''' is the use of power by government officials for illegitimate private gain. Misuse of [[government]] power for other purposes, such as [[Political repression|repression]] of political opponents and general [[police brutality]], is not considered political corruption. Neither are illegal acts by private persons or corporations not directly involved with the government. An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties, is done under [[color of law]] or involves [[Influence peddling|trading in influence]].  . 

Forms of corruption vary, but include [[bribery]], [[extortion]], [[cronyism]], [[nepotism]], [[patronage]], [[Graft (politics)|graft]], and [[embezzlement]]. Corruption may facilitate [[Organized crime|criminal enterprise]] such as [[drug trafficking]], [[money laundering]], and [[human trafficking]], though is not restricted to these activities.  . 

The activities that constitute illegal corruption differ depending on the country or jurisdiction. For instance, some political funding practices that are legal in one place may be illegal in another. In some cases, government officials have broad or ill-defined powers, which make it difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal actions. 
Worldwide, bribery alone is estimated to involve over 1 trillion US dollars annually. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6288400.stm African corruption 'on the wane'], 10 July 2007, [[BBC News]]</ref> A state of unrestrained political corruption is known as a [[kleptocracy]], literally meaning "rule by thieves".  .

==Effects==. 
===Effects on politics, administration, and institutions===. 
[[Image:Corrupt-Legislation-Vedder-Highsmith-detail-1.jpeg|thumb|300px|Detail from ''Corrupt Legislation'' (1896) by [[Elihu Vedder]]. Library of Congress [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], Washington, D.C.]] Corruption poses a serious development challenge. In the political realm, it undermines democracy and [[good governance]] by flouting or even subverting formal processes. Corruption in elections and in legislative bodies reduces accountability and distorts representation in policymaking; corruption in the judiciary compromises the [[rule of law]]; and corruption in [[public administration]] results in the inefficient provision of services.  It violates a basic principle of [[republicanism]] regarding the centrality of civic virtue. More generally, corruption erodes the institutional capacity of government as procedures are disregarded, resources are siphoned off, and public offices are bought and sold. At the same time, corruption undermines the legitimacy of government and such democratic values as trust and tolerance.  . 

===Economic effects===. 
{{see also|Corporate crime}}
In the [[private sector]], corruption increases the cost of business through the price of illicit payments themselves, the management cost of negotiating with officials, and the risk of breached agreements or detection. Although some claim corruption reduces costs by cutting [[bureaucracy]], the availability of bribes can also induce officials to contrive new rules and delays. Openly removing costly and lengthy regulations are better than covertly allowing them to be bypassed by using bribes. Where corruption inflates the cost of business, it also distorts the playing field, shielding firms with connections from competition and thereby sustaining inefficient firms. <ref>Luis Flores Ballesteros, [http://54pesos.org/2008/11/15/corruption-and-development-does-the-%E2%80%9Crule-of-law%E2%80%9D-factor-weigh-more-than-we-think "Corruption and development. Does the “rule of law” factor weigh more than we think?"] 54 Pesos (November 15, 2008). Retrieved April 12, 2011</ref> . 

Corruption also generates economic distortions in the [[public sector]] by diverting public investment into capital projects where bribes and kickbacks are more plentiful. Officials may increase the technical complexity of public sector projects to conceal or pave the way for such dealings, thus further distorting investment. <ref>[http://www.uneca.org/aec/documents/Mina%20Baliamoune-Lutz_%20Leonce%20Ndikumana.pdf Corruption and growth in African countries: Exploring the investment channel, lead author Mina Baliamoune-Lutz, Department of Economics, University of North Florida, pages 1,2]</ref> Corruption also lowers compliance with construction, environmental, or other regulations, reduces the quality of government services and infrastructure, and increases budgetary pressures on government.  . 

Economists argue that one of the factors behind the differing [[economic development]] in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]] is that in Africa, corruption has primarily taken the form of [[rent seeking|rent extraction]] with the resulting [[financial capital]] moved overseas rather than invested at home (hence the stereotypical, but often accurate, image of African dictators having [[Swiss bank|Swiss bank accounts]]). In [[Nigeria]], for example, more than $400 billion was stolen from the treasury by Nigeria's leaders between 1960 and 1999. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/nigerias-corruption-busters.html |title=Nigeria's corruption busters |publisher=Unodc.org |date= |accessdate=2009-12-05}}</ref> [[University of Massachusetts]] researchers estimated that from 1970 to 1996, [[capital flight]] from 30 [[sub-Saharan]] countries totaled $187bn, exceeding those nations' external debts. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/Economy/200503140015 |title=When the money goes west |publisher=New Statesman |date=2005-03-14 |accessdate=2009-11-05}}</ref> (The results, expressed in retarded or suppressed development, have been modeled in theory by economist [[Mancur Olson]].) In the case of Africa, one of the factors for this behavior was political instability, and the fact that new governments often confiscated previous government's corruptly-obtained assets. This encouraged officials to stash their wealth abroad, out of reach of any future [[Nationalization|expropriation]]. In contrast, Asian administrations such as [[Suharto]]'s [[Orde Baru|New Order]] often took a cut on business transactions or provided conditions for development, through infrastructure investment, law and order, etc.  . 

===Environmental and social effects===. 
Corruption facilitates environmental destruction. Corrupt countries may formally have legislation to protect the environment, it cannot be enforced if  officials can easily be bribed. The same applies to social rights worker protection, [[Trade union|unionization]] prevention, and [[child labor]]. Violation of these laws rights enables corrupt countries to gain illegitimate economic advantage in the international market.  . 

The [[Nobel Prize]]-winning economist [[Amartya Sen]] has observed that "there is no such thing as an apolitical food problem." While [[drought]] and other naturally occurring events may trigger [[famine]] conditions, it is government action or inaction that determines its severity, and often even whether or not a famine will occur. Governments with strong tendencies towards [[kleptocracy]] can undermine [[food security]] even when harvests are good. 
Officials often steal state property. In [[Bihar]], [[India]], more than 80% of the subsidized food aid to poor is stolen by corrupt officials. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2007/08/15/wipro-tata-corruption-ent-law-cx_kw_0814whartonindia.html|title=Will Growth Slow Corruption In India?|publisher=Forbes | date=2007-08-15}}</ref> Similarly, food aid is often robbed at gunpoint by governments, criminals, and warlords alike, and sold for a profit. The 20th century is full of many examples of governments undermining the food security of their own nations – sometimes intentionally. <ref>{{cite news|last=Sheeter |first=Laura |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7111296.stm |title=Ukraine remembers famine horror |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-11-24 |accessdate=2009-12-05}}</ref> . 

=== Effects on Humanitarian Aid ===. 
The scale of [[humanitarian aid]] to the poor and unstable regions of the world grows, but it is highly vulnerable to corruption, with food aid, construction and other highly valued assistance as the most at risk. <ref name=ODI1>Sarah Bailey (2008) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2385&title=corruption-risks-perceptions-prevention-humanitarian-assistance Need and greed: corruption risks, perceptions and prevention in humanitarian assistance] [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> Food aid can be directly and physically diverted from its intended destination, or indirectly through the manipulation of assessments, targeting, registration and distributions to favour certain groups or individuals. <ref name=ODI1/> Elsewhere, in construction and shelter, there are numerous opportunities for diversion and profit through substandard workmanship, kickbacks for contracts and favouritism in the provision of valuable shelter material. <ref name=ODI1/> Thus while humanitarian aid agencies are usually most concerned about aid being diverted by including too many, recipients themselves are most concerned about exclusion. <ref name=ODI1/> Access to aid may be limited to those with connections, to those who pay bribes or are forced to give sexual favours. <ref name=ODI1/> Equally, those able to do so may manipulate statistics to inflate the number beneficiaries and syphon of the additional assistance. <ref name=ODI1/> . 

===Other areas: health, public safety, education, trade unions, etc.===. 
{{see also|Police corruption}}
Corruption is not specific to poor, developing, or transition countries. In western countries, cases of bribery and other forms of corruption in all possible fields exist: under-the-table payments made to reputed surgeons by patients attempting to be on top of the list of forthcoming surgeries,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/health/Cash+bribes+patients+atop+surgery+waiting+lists/3893239/story.html |title=Cash bribes put patients atop surgery waiting lists |publisher=''The Vancouver Sun'' |date=November 27, 2010 |last=Fidelman |first=Charlie |accessdate=2011-01-21 }}</ref> bribes paid by suppliers to the automotive industry in order to sell low-quality connectors used for instance in safety equipment such as airbags, bribes paid by suppliers to manufacturers of defibrillators (to sell low-quality capacitors), contributions paid by wealthy parents to the "social and culture fund" of a prestigious university in exchange for it to accept their children, bribes paid to obtain diplomas, financial and other advantages granted to unionists by members of the executive board of a car manufacturer in exchange for employer-friendly positions and votes, etc. Examples are endless. These various manifestations of corruption can ultimately present a danger for the public health; they can discredit specific, essential institutions or social relationships.  . 

Corruption can also affect the various components of sports activities (referees, players, medical and laboratory staff involved in anti-doping controls, members of national sport federation and international committees deciding about the allocation of contracts and competition places).  . 

Cases exist against (members of) various types of non-profit and non-government organisations, as well as religious organisations.  . 

Ultimately, the distinction between public and private sector corruption sometimes appears rather artificial and national anti-corruption initiatives may need to avoid legal and other loopholes in the coverage of the instruments.  . 

==Types==. 
===Bribery===. 
{{Main|Bribery}}
A bribe is a payment given personally to a government official in exchange of his use of official powers. [[Bribery]] requires two participants: one to give the bribe, and one to take it. Either may initiate the corrupt offering; for example, a customs official may demand bribes to let through allowed (or disallowed) goods, or a smuggler might offer bribes to gain passage. In some countries the [[culture of corruption]] extends to every aspect of public life, making it extremely difficult for individuals to stay in business without resorting to bribes. Bribes may be demanded in order for an official to do something he is already paid to do. They may also be demanded in order to bypass laws and regulations. In addition to using bribery for private financial gain, they are also used to intentionally and maliciously cause harm to another (i.e. no financial incentive). In some developing nations, up to half of the population has paid bribes during the past 12 months. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases/2005/09_12_2005_barometer_2005 |title=How common is bribe-paying? |quote=...a relatively high proportion of families in a group of Central Eastern European, African, and Latin American countries paid a bribe in the previous twelve months.}}</ref> . 

In recent years, efforts have been made by the international community to encourage countries to dissociate and incriminate as separate offences, active and passive bribery. Active bribery can be defined for instance as ''the promising, offering or giving by any person, directly or indirectly, of any undue advantage [to any public official], for himself or herself or for anyone else, for him or her to act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her functions.'' (article 2 of [http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=173&CL=ENG the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173)] of the [[Council of Europe]]). Passive bribery can be defined as ''the request or receipt [by any public official], directly or indirectly, of any undue advantage, for himself or herself or for anyone else, or the acceptance of an offer or a promise of such an advantage, to act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her functions'' (article 3 of [http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=173&CL=ENG the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173)]). The reason for this dissociation is to make the early steps (offering, promising, requesting an advantage) of a corrupt deal already an offence and, thus, to give a clear signal (from a criminal policy point of view) that bribery is not acceptable. Furthermore, such a dissociation makes the prosecution of bribery offences easier since it can be very difficult to prove that two parties (the bribe-giver and the bribe-taker) have formally agreed upon a corrupt deal. In addition, there is often no such formal deal but only a mutual understanding, for instance when it is common knowledge in a municipality that to obtain a building permit one has to pay a "fee" to the decision maker to obtain a favourable decision. A working definition of corruption is also provided as follows in article 3 of [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=174&CM=1&DF=7/18/2008&CL=ENG the Civil Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 174)]: ''For the purpose of this Convention, "corruption" means requesting, offering, giving or accepting, directly or indirectly, a bribe or any other undue advantage or prospect thereof, which distorts the proper performance of any duty or behavior required of the recipient of the bribe, the undue advantage or the prospect thereof. 
'' . 

===Trading in influence===. 
Trading in influence, or [[influence peddling]] in some countries, refers to the situation where a person is selling his/her influence over the decision process involving a third party (person or institution). The difference with bribery is that this is a tri-lateral relation. From a legal point of view, the role of the third party (who is the target of the influence) does not really matter although he/she can be an accessory in some instances. It can be difficult to make a distinction between this form of corruption and some forms of extreme and loosely regulated [[lobbying]] where for instance law- or decision-makers can freely "sell" their vote, decision power or influence to those lobbyists who offer the highest compensation, including where for instance the latter act on behalf of powerful clients such as industrial groups who want to avoid the passing of specific environmental, social, or other regulations perceived as too stringent, etc. Where lobbying is (sufficiently) regulated, it becomes possible to provide for a distinctive criteria and to consider that trading in influence involves the use of "improper influence", as in article 12 of [http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=173&CL=ENG the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173)] of the [[Council of Europe]].  . 

===Patronage===. 
{{Main|Patronage}}
[[Patronage]] refers to favoring supporters, for example with government employment. This may be legitimate, as when a newly elected government changes the top officials in the administration in order to effectively implement its policy. It can be seen as corruption if this means that incompetent persons, as a payment for supporting the regime, are selected before more able ones. In nondemocracies many government officials are often selected for loyalty rather than ability. They may be almost exclusively selected from a particular group (for example, [[Sunni]] Arabs in [[Saddam Hussein]]'s Iraq, the [[nomenklatura]] in the [[Soviet Union]], or the [[Junker]]s in [[Imperial Germany]]) that support the regime in return for such favors. A similar problem can also be seen in Eastern Europe, for example in Romania, where the government is often accused of patronage (when a new government comes to power it rapidly changes most of the officials in the public sector).  In some countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]], patronage is institutionalized in the [[payroll vote]] system, whereby members of Parliament are rewarded with employment as Government ministers, and in return required to vote in favour of the Government's position.  . 

===Nepotism and cronyism===. 
{{Main|Nepotism|Cronyism}}
Favoring relatives ([[nepotism]]) or personal friends ([[cronyism]]) of an official is a form of illegitimate private gain. This may be combined with [[bribery]], for example demanding that a business should employ a [[kinship|relative]] of an official controlling regulations affecting the business. The most extreme example is when the entire state is inherited, as in [[North Korea]] or [[Syria]]. A milder form of cronyism is a "[[Good ol' boy network]]", in which appointees to official positions are selected only from a closed and exclusive social network – such as the alumni of particular universities – instead of appointing the most competent candidate.  . 

Seeking to harm enemies becomes corruption when official powers are illegitimately used as means to this end. For example, trumped-up charges are often brought up against journalists or writers who bring up politically sensitive issues, such as a politician's acceptance of bribes.  . 

===Electoral fraud===. 
{{Main|Electoral fraud}} . 

'''Electoral fraud''' is illegal interference with the process of an [[election]]. Acts of [[fraud]] affect vote counts to bring about an election result, whether by increasing the vote share of the favored candidate, depressing the vote share of the rival candidates, or both. Also called '''voter fraud''', the mechanisms involved include illegal voter registration, intimidation at polls, and improper vote counting.  . 

===Embezzlement===. 
{{Main|Embezzlement}}
[[Embezzlement]] is outright theft of entrusted funds. It is political when it involves public money taken by a responsible public official. A common type of embezzlement is that of personal use of entrusted government resources; for example, when an official assigns public employees to renovate his own house.  . 

===Kickbacks===. 
{{see also|Anti-competitive practices|Bid rigging}}A [[Money trail|kickback]] is an official's share of misappropriated funds allocated from his or her organization to an organization involved in corrupt [[bidding]]. For example, suppose that a politician is in charge of choosing how to spend some public funds. He can give a [[contract]] to a [[General contractor|company]] that is not the best bidder, or allocate more than they deserve. In this case, the company benefits, and in exchange for betraying the public, the official receives a kickback payment, which is a portion of the sum the company received. This sum itself may be all or a portion of the difference between the actual (inflated) payment to the company and the (lower) market-based price that would have been paid had the bidding been competitive. Kickbacks are not limited to government officials; any situation in which people are entrusted to spend funds that do not belong to them are susceptible to this kind of corruption.  . 

=== Unholy alliance ===. 
An [[Unholy Alliance (geopolitical)|unholy alliance]] is a coalition among seemingly antagonistic groups for [[ad hoc]] or hidden gain. Like patronage, unholy alliances are not necessarily illegal, but unlike patronage, by its deceptive nature and often great financial resources, an unholy alliance can be much more dangerous to the [[public interest]]. An early, well-known use of the term was by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (TR): . 

:"To destroy this invisible Government, to dissolve the '''unholy alliance''' between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day." – 1912 [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] Platform, attributed to TR<ref>{{cite news|author=By Patricia O''Toole Sunday, Jun. 25, 2006 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1207791-2,00.html |title=O'Toole, Patricia, "The War of 1912," TIME in Partnership with CNN, Jun. 25, 2006 |publisher=Time.com |date=2006-06-25 |accessdate=2009-12-05}}</ref> and quoted again in his autobiography<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/55/15b.html |title=Roosevelt, Theodore. '&#39;An Autobiography:'&#39; XV.

=== Involvement in organized crime ===. 
An illustrative example of official involvement in [[organized crime]] can be found from 1920s and 1930s [[Shanghai]], where Huang Jinrong was a police chief in the [[French concession]], while simultaneously being a gang boss and co-operating with [[Du Yuesheng]], the [[Green Gang|local gang]] ringleader. The relationship kept the flow of profits from the gang's gambling dens, prostitution, and protection rackets undisturbed.  . 

The United States accused [[Manuel Noriega]]'s government in [[Panama]] of being a "[[narcokleptocracy]]", a corrupt government profiting on illegal drug trade. Later the U.S. invaded Panama and captured Noriega.  . 

==Conditions favorable for corruption==. 
{{Prose|section|date=December 2009}}
It is argued that the following conditions are favorable for corruption: . 

*Information deficits
** Lacking [[freedom of information legislation]]. For example: The Indian [[Right to Information Act]] 2005 is perceived to have "already engendered mass movements in the country that is bringing the lethargic, often corrupt bureaucracy to its knees and changing power equations completely."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=52046 |title=AsiaMedia :: Right to Information Act India's magic wand against corruption |publisher=Asiamedia.ucla.edu |date=2006-08-31 |accessdate=2009-11-05}}</ref>
** Lack of investigative reporting in the local media. 
** Contempt for or negligence of exercising [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]]. 
** Weak [[accounting]] practices, including lack of timely financial management. 
** Lack of measurement of corruption. For example, using regular surveys of households and businesses in order to quantify the degree of perception of corruption in different parts of a nation or in different government institutions may increase awareness of corruption and create pressure to combat it. This will also enable an evaluation of the officials who are fighting corruption and the methods used. 
** [[Tax haven]]s which tax their own citizens and companies but not those from other nations and refuse to disclose information necessary for foreign taxation. This enables large scale political corruption in the foreign nations. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,,1994976,00.html |title=Western bankers and lawyers 'rob Africa of $150bn every year |publisher=Observer.guardian.co.uk |date=2007-01-21 |accessdate=2009-12-05 | location=London | first=Nick | last=Mathiason}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} . 

* Lacking control of the government. 
** Lacking [[civic society]] and [[non-governmental organization]]s which monitor the government. 
** An individual voter may have a [[rational ignorance]] regarding politics, especially in nationwide elections, since each vote has little weight. 
** Weak [[civil service]], and slow pace of [[civil service reform in developing countries|reform]]. 
** Weak [[rule of law]]. 
** Weak [[Lawyer|legal profession]]. 
** Weak [[judicial independence]]. 
** Lacking protection of [[whistleblower]]s. 
*** [[Government Accountability Project]]
** Lack of [[benchmarking]], that is continual detailed evaluation of procedures and comparison to others who do similar things, in the same government or others, in particular comparison to those who do the best work. The Peruvian organization Ciudadanos al Dia has started to measure and compare transparency, costs, and efficiency in different government departments in Peru. It annually awards the best practices which has received widespread media attention. This has created competition among government agencies in order to improve. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://psdblog.worldbank.org/psdblog/2006/08/why_benchmarkin.html#more |title=Why benchmarking works – PSD Blog – World Bank Group |publisher=Psdblog.worldbank.org |date=2006-08-17 |accessdate=2009-11-05}}</ref> . 

*Opportunities and incentives
** Individual officials routinely handle cash, instead of handling payments by [[giro]] or on a separate cash desk—illegitimate withdrawals from supervised bank accounts are much more difficult to conceal. 
** Public funds are centralized rather than distributed. For example, if $1,000 is embezzled from a local agency that has $2,000 funds, it is easier to notice than from a national agency with $2,000,000 funds. See the [[subsidiarity|principle of subsidiarity]]. 
** Large, unsupervised public investments. 
** Sale of state-owned property and privatization.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
** Poorly-paid government officials. 
** Government licenses needed to conduct business, e.g., [[import license]]s, encourage bribing and kickbacks. 
** Long-time work in the same position may create relationships inside and outside the government which encourage and help conceal corruption and favoritism. Rotating government officials to different positions and geographic areas may help prevent this; for instance certain high rank officials in French government services (e.g. [[Trésor public|treasurer-paymasters general]]) must rotate every few years. 
** Costly [[political campaign]]s, with expenses exceeding normal sources of political funding, especially when funded with taxpayer money. 
** Less interaction with officials reduces the opportunities for corruption. For example, using the Internet for sending in required information, like applications and tax forms, and then processing this with automated computer systems. This may also speed up the processing and reduce unintentional human errors. See [[e-Government]]. 
** A windfall from exporting abundant natural resources may encourage corruption. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adelaide.edu.au/cies/papers/0320.pdf |title=Resources for Sale: Corruption, Democracy and the Natural Resource Curse |format=pdf |last1=Damania |first1=Richard |first2=Erwin |last2=Bulte |date=July 2003 |publisher=Centre for International Economic Studies, University of Adelaide |accessdate=2010-12-11 }}</ref> ''(See [[Resource curse]])''
** [[War]] and other forms of conflict correlate with a breakdown of [[public security]]. 
*Social conditions
** Self-interested closed cliques and "[[Good ol' boy network]]s". 
** Family-, and clan-centered social structure, with a tradition of [[nepotism]]/favouritism being acceptable. 
** A [[gift economy]], such as the Soviet [[Blat (term)|blat]] system, emerges in a Communist [[centrally planned economy]]. 
** Lacking [[literacy]] and [[education]] among the population. 
** Frequent [[discrimination]] and [[bullying]] among the population. 
** Tribal solidarity, giving benefits to certain ethnic groups
In the Indian political system, for example, it has become usual that the leadership of national and regional parties are passed from generation to generation<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/soutikbiswas/2011/01/is_india_sliding_into_a.html |title=Is India sliding into a hereditary monarchy?|author=Soutik Biswas |date=1-18-2011 |work=BBC |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=3 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/column/the-gandhi-dynasty-politics-as-usual/20110805.htm|title=The Gandhi dynasty: Politics as usual|first1=Neelam|last1=Deo|first1=Manjeet|last2=Kripalani |date=8-5-2011 |work=Rediff|publisher=Rediff News|accessdate=3 September 2011}}</ref>
creating a system in which a family holds the center of power. Some examples are most of the Dravidian parties of south India and also the [[Congress party]], which is one of the two major political parties in India.  . 

===Size of public sector===. 
Extensive and diverse public spending is, in itself, inherently at risk of cronyism, kickbacks, and embezzlement. Complicated regulations and arbitrary, unsupervised official conduct exacerbate the problem. This is one argument for [[privatization]] and [[deregulation]]. Opponents of privatization see the argument as ideological. The argument that corruption necessarily follows from the opportunity is weakened by the existence of countries with low to non-existent corruption but large public sectors, like the [[Nordic countries]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/sachs110 |title=Lessons From the North|publisher=Project Syndicate |date= |accessdate=2009-11-05}}</ref> However, these countries score high on the [[Ease of Doing Business Index]], due to good and often simple regulations, and have [[rule of law]] firmly established. Therefore, due to their lack of corruption in the first place, they can run large public sectors without inducing political corruption.  . 

Like other governmental economic activities, also privatization, such as in the sale of government-owned property, is particularly at the risk of cronyism. Privatizations in Russia, Latin America, and East Germany were accompanied by large scale corruption during the sale of the state owned companies. Those with political connections unfairly gained large wealth, which has discredited privatization in these regions. While media have reported widely the grand corruption that accompanied the sales, studies have argued that in addition to increased operating efficiency, daily petty corruption is, or would be, larger without privatization, and that corruption is more prevalent in non-privatized sectors. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that extralegal and unofficial activities are more prevalent in countries that privatized less. <ref>Privatization in Competitive Sectors: The Record to Date. Sunita Kikeri and John Nellis. World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 2860, June 2002. [http://www.econ.chula.ac.th/about/member/sothitorn/privatization.pdf Econ.Chula.ac.th] Privatization and Corruption. David Martimort and Stéphane Straub. [http://idei.fr/doc/conf/veol/straub_martimort.pdf IDEI.fr]</ref> . 

There is the counter point, however, that industries with an [[oligarchy]] of companies can be quite corrupt, with collusive price-fixing, pressuring dependent businesses, etc., and only by having a portion of the market owned by someone ''other than'' that oligarchy, i.e. public sector, can keep them in line. If the public sector company is making money and selling their product for half of the price of the private sector companies, the private sector companies won't be able to simultaneously gouge to that degree and keep their customers: the competition keeps them in line.  Private sector corruption can increase the poverty and helplessness of the population, so it can affect government corruption, in the long-term.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} . 

In the European Union, the principle of subsidiarity is applied: a government service should be provided by the lowest, most local authority that can competently provide it. An effect is that distribution of funds into multiple instances discourages embezzlement, because even small sums missing will be noticed. In contrast, in a centralized authority, even minute proportions of public funds can be large sums of money.  . 

==Governmental corruption==. 
If the highest echelons of the governments also take advantage from corruption or embezzlement from the state's treasury, it is sometimes referred with the [[neologism]] ''[[kleptocracy]]''. Members of the government can take advantage of the [[natural resource]]s (e.g., diamonds and oil in a few prominent cases) or state-owned productive industries. A number of corrupt governments have enriched themselves via foreign aid, which is often spent on showy buildings and armaments.  . 

A corrupt [[dictatorship]] typically results in many years of general hardship and suffering for the vast majority of citizens as [[civil society]] and the [[rule of law]] disintegrate. In addition, corrupt dictators routinely ignore economic and [[society|social]] problems in their quest to amass ever more wealth and power.  . 

The classic case of a corrupt, exploitive dictator often given is the regime of [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko]], who ruled the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (which he renamed [[Zaire]]) from 1965 to 1997. It is said that usage of the term [[kleptocracy]] gained popularity largely in response to a need to accurately describe Mobutu's regime. Another classic case is [[Nigeria]], especially under the rule of General [[Sani Abacha]] who was ''[[de facto]]'' president of Nigeria from 1993 until his death in 1998.  He is reputed to have stolen some [[US$]]3–4 billion.  He and his relatives are often mentioned in [[Advance-fee fraud|Nigerian 419 letter scams]] claiming to offer vast fortunes for "help" in laundering his stolen "fortunes", which in reality turn out not to exist. <ref>Who wants to be a millionaire? – An online collection of Nigerian scam mails</ref> More than $400 billion was stolen from the treasury by Nigeria's leaders between 1960 and 1999. <ref>{{cite web |title=Nigeria's corruption totals $400 billion |publisher=''[[Malaysia Today]]'' |date=June 27, 2005 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071211033642/http://web.archive.org/web/20071211033642/http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-e/2005/06/nigerias-corruption-totals-400-billion.htm |archivedate=2007-12-11}} </ref> . 

More recently, articles in various financial periodicals, most notably ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, have pointed to [[Fidel Castro]], General Secretary of the Republic of [[Cuba]] since 1959, of likely being the beneficiary of up to $900 million, based on "his control" of state-owned companies. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/2006-05-04-castro_x.htm |title=Fidel Castro net worth rises, according to 'Forbes' |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2006-05-04 |accessdate=2009-11-05}}</ref> Opponents of his regime claim that he has used money amassed through weapons sales, narcotics, international loans, and confiscation of private property to enrich himself and his political cronies who hold his dictatorship together, and that the $900 million published by [[Forbes]] is merely a portion of his assets, although that needs to be proven. <ref>{{cite web|last=Shapiro |first=Ben |url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/BenShapiro/2006/08/02/the_death_of_fidel_castro |title=Ben Shapiro :: Townhall.com :: The death of Fidel Castro |publisher=Townhall.com |date=2006-08-05 |accessdate=2009-11-05}}</ref> . 

==Judiciary corruption==. 
There are two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the state (through budget planning and various privileges), and the private. [[Budget]] of the judiciary in many transitional and [[developing countries]] is almost completely controlled by the executive. The latter undermines the separation of powers, as it creates a critical financial dependence of the judiciary. The proper national wealth distribution including the government spending on the judiciary is subject of the [[constitutional economics]]. <ref>{{cite book |first= Peter |last=Barenboim |title= Defining the rules |publisher= The European Lawyer |volume= Issue 90 |date=October 2009}}</ref> . 

==Fighting corruption==. 
[[Mobile telecommunications]] and [[radio broadcasting]] help to fight corruption, especially in developing regions like [[Africa]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voicesfromemergingmarkets.com/?p=19 |title=Mobile Phones and Radios Combat Corruption in Burundi – Voices from Emerging Markets |publisher=Voicesfromemergingmarkets.com |date=2009-03-12 |accessdate=2009-11-05}}</ref> where other forms of [[communication]]s are limited. 
In India the anti corruption bureau Fights against corruption and a new ombudsman bill called jan lokpal bill is being prepared.  . 

In the 1990s, initiatives were taken at an international level (in particular by the [[European Community]], the [[Council of Europe]], the [[OECD]]) to put a ban on corruption: in 1996, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe,<ref>http://www.coe.int/t/cm/Home_en.asp</ref> for instance, adopted a comprehensive Programme of Action against Corruption and, subsequently, issued a series of anti-corruption standard-setting instruments:
* the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173);<ref>http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=173&CL=ENG </ref>
* the Civil Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 174);<ref>http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=174&CM=1&DF=7/18/2008&CL=ENG</ref> 
* the Additional Protocol to the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 191);<ref>http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=191&CM=1&DF=7/18/2008&CL=ENG</ref>
* the Twenty Guiding Principles for the Fight against Corruption (Resolution (97) 24);<ref>http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/greco/documents/Resolution(97)24_EN.pdf</ref>
* the Recommendation on Codes of Conduct for Public Officials (Recommendation No. R (2000) 10);<ref>http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/greco/documents/Rec(2000)10_EN.pdf</ref>
* the Recommendation on Common Rules against Corruption in the Funding of Political Parties and Electoral Campaigns (Rec(2003)4)<ref>http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/greco/general/Rec(2003)4_EN.pdf</ref> . 

The purpose of these instruments was to address the various forms of corruption (involving the public sector, the private sector, the financing of political activities, etc.) whether they had a strictly domestic or also a transnational dimension. To monitor the implementation at national level of the requirements and principles provided in those texts, a monitoring mechanism – the [[Group of States Against Corruption]] (also known as GRECO) was created.  . 

Further conventions were adopted at the regional level under the aegis of the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS or OEA), the [[African Union]], and in 2003, at the universal level under that of the [[United Nations]].  . 

==Whistleblowers==. 
{{Main|Whistleblower}} . 

== Campaign contributions == . 

In the political arena, corruption is mainly proven by following the [[money trail]].  However, the connection between the contribution and anything in return is difficult to prove. For this reason, there are often unproven rumors, that are termed, [[smear campaign]], about many politicians.  . 

Politicians are placed in apparently compromising positions because of their need to solicit financial contributions for their [[campaign finance]]. If they then appear to be acting in the interests of those parties that funded them, it could be considered corruption.  Though donations may be coincidental, the question asked is, why are they funding politicians at all, if they get nothing for their money.   . 

Laws regulating [[campaign finance in the United States]] require that all contributions, and their, use should be publicly disclosed. However, some manage to [[Political_action_committee#Keeping_donor_lists_hidden_from_voters|evade disclosure]] till at after votes were made or years later.  Many companies, especially larger ones, fund both the Democratic and Republican parties. Certain countries, such as [[France]], ban altogether the corporate funding of political parties. Because of the possible circumvention of this ban with respect to the funding of political campaigns, France also imposes maximum spending caps on campaigning; candidates that have exceeded those limits, or that have handed in misleading accounting reports, risk having their candidacy ruled invalid.  They also may be prevented from running in future elections. In addition, the government funds political parties according to their successes in elections.  . 

In some countries, political parties are run solely off [[subscription]]s (membership fees).  . 

Even legal measures such as these have been argued to be legalized corruption, in that they often favor the political status quo. Minor parties and independents often argue that efforts to rein in the influence of contributions do little more than protect the major parties with guaranteed public funding while constraining the possibility of private funding by outsiders. In these instances, officials are legally taking money from the public coffers for their election campaigns to guarantee that they will continue to hold their influential and often well-paid positions. 
<!-- Please supply information on the incident in Italy, 1004, where Berlusconi was charged with but acquitted of illegally profiteering from the buying and selling of businesses. --> . 

As indicated above, the Committee of Ministers of the [[Council of Europe]] recognised in 1996 the importance of links between corruption and political financing. It adopted in 1837 [http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/greco/general/Rec(2003)4_EN.pdf the Recommendation on Common Rules against Corruption in the Funding of Political Parties and Electoral Campaigns (Rec(2003)4)]. This text is quite unique at international levels as it aims i.a. at increasing transparency in the funding of political parties and election campaigns (these two areas are difficult to dissociate since parties are also involved in campaigning and in many countries, parties do not have the monopoly over the presentation of candidates for elections), ensuring a certain level of control over the funding and spending connected with political activities, and making sure infringements are subject to effective, proportionate, and dissuasive sanctions. In the context of its monitoring activities, the [[Group of States Against Corruption]] has identified a great variety of possible improvements in those areas (see the country reports adopted under the [http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/greco/evaluations/index_en.asp Third Evaluation Round]).  . 

== Measuring corruption ==. 
Measuring corruption statistically is difficult if not impossible due to the illicit nature of the transaction and imprecise definitions of corruption. <ref name="commons.globalintegrity.org">{{cite web |url=http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/09/users-guide-to-measuring-corruption.html |title=A Users' Guide to Measuring Corruption |publisher=[[Global Integrity]] |date=September 5, 2008 |accessdate=2010-12-11 }}</ref> While "corruption" indices first appeared in 1995 with the [[Corruption Perceptions Index]], all of these metrics address different proxies for corruption, such as public perceptions of the extent of the problem. <ref name="Galtung, Fredrik 2006">Galtung, Fredrik (2006). "Measuring the Immeasurable: Boundaries and Functions of (Macro) Corruption Indices," in Measuring Corruption, Charles Sampford, Arthur Shacklock, Carmel Connors, and Fredrik Galtung, Eds. (Ashgate): 101–130. </ref> . 

[[Transparency International]], an anti-corruption [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]], pioneered this field with the Corruption Perceptions Index, first released in 1995. This work is often credited with breaking a taboo and forcing the issue of corruption into high level development policy discourse. Transparency International currently publishes three measures, updated annually: a [[Corruption Perceptions Index]](CPI) (based on aggregating third-party polling of public perceptions of how corrupt different countries are); a Global Corruption Barometer (based on a survey of general public attitudes toward and experience of corruption); and a [[Bribe Payers Index]], looking at the willingness of foreign firms to pay bribes. The Corruption Perceptions Index is the best known of these metrics, though it has drawn much criticism<ref name="Galtung, Fredrik 2006"/><ref>Sik, Endre (2002). "The Bad, the Worse and the Worst: Guesstimating the Level of Corruption," in Political Corruption in Transition: A Skeptic's Handbook, Stephen Kotkin and Andras Sajo, Eds. (Budapest: Central European University Press): 91–113. </ref><ref>Arndt, Christiane and Charles Oman (2006). Uses and Abuses of Governance Indicators (Paris: OECD Development Centre). </ref> and may be declining in influence. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/trends?q=Transparency+International&ctab=-1&geo=all&date=all |title=Media citing Transparency International |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-05}}</ref> . 

The World Bank collects [http://www.worldbank.org/wbi/governance/data/ a range of data on corruption], including [http://www.enterprisesurveys.org/ExploreTopics/?topicid=3 survey responses from over 100,000 firms worldwide] and a set of [http://go.worldbank.org/IU54LJVHT0 indicators of governance and institutional quality.] Moreover, one of the six dimensions of governance measured by the [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] is Control of Corruption, which is defined as "the extent to which power is exercised for private gain, including both petty and grand forms of corruption, as well as 'capture' of the state by elites and private interests."<ref>{{cite web |title=A Decade of Measuring the Quality of Governance |year=2007 |publisher=The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, The World Bank |page=3 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080527211855/http://web.archive.org/web/20080527211855/http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi2007/pdf/booklet_decade_of_measuring_governance.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-27}} </ref> While the definition itself is fairly precise, the data aggregated into the Worldwide Governance Indicators is based on any available polling: questions range from "is corruption a serious problem?" to measures of public access to information, and not consistent across countries. Despite these weaknesses, the global coverage of these datasets has led to their widespread adoption, most notably by the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]]. <ref name="commons.globalintegrity.org"/> . 

In part in response to these criticisms, a second wave of corruption metrics has been created by [[Global Integrity]], the [http://www.internationalbudget.org/ International Budget Partnership], and many lesser known local groups, starting with the [[Global Integrity Index]],<ref>http://report.globalintegrity.org/</ref> first published in 2004. These second wave projects aim not to create awareness, but to create policy change via targeting resources more effectively and creating checklists toward incremental reform. Global Integrity and the International Budget Partnership<ref>http://www.internationalbudget.org/</ref> each dispense with public surveys and instead uses in-country experts to evaluate "the opposite of corruption" – which Global Integrity defines as the public policies that prevent, discourage, or expose corruption. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://report.globalintegrity.org/methodology/whitepaper.cfm |title=The Global Integrity Report: 2009 Methodology White Paper |publisher=[[Global Integrity]] |year=2009 |accessdate=2010-12-11 }}</ref> These approaches compliment the first wave, awareness-raising tools by giving governments facing public outcry a checklist which measures concrete steps toward improved governance. <ref name="commons.globalintegrity.org"/> . 

Typical second wave corruption metrics do not offer the worldwide coverage found in first wave projects, and instead focus on localizing information gathered to specific problems and creating deep, "unpackable" content that matches quantitative and qualitative data. Meanwhile, alternative approaches such as the British aid agency's Drivers of Change research skips numbers entirely and favors understanding corruption via political economy analysis of who controls power in a given society. <ref name="commons.globalintegrity.org"/> .
