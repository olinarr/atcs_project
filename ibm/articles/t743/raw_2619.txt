In [[philosophy|philosophical]], [[theology|theological]], or moral discussions, '''corruption''' is [[spiritual]] or [[moral]] [[impurity]] or deviation from an [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]]. In [[economy]], corruption is [[payment]] for services or material which the recipient is not due, under law. This may be called [[bribery]], [[kickback]], or, in the Middle East, [[baksheesh]]. In government it is when an elected representative makes decisions that are influenced by vested interest rather than their own personal or party ideological beliefs.  . 

==Etymology==. 
The word '''corrupt''' (Middle English, from Latin ''corruptus'', past participle of ''corrumpere'', to abuse or destroy : ''com-'', [[intensive]] pref. and ''rumpere'', to break) when used as an adjective literally means "utterly broken". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/corrupt |title=Corrupt &#124; Define Corrupt at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-06}}</ref> .

Political corruption is the abuse of public power, office, or resources by elected government officials for personal gain, e.g. by extortion, soliciting or offering bribes<ref>{{Citation | last = Chinhamo | first = Obert | last2 = Shumba | first2 = Gabriel

Governmental corruption of judiciary is broadly known in many transitional and [[developing countries]] because the [[budget]] is almost completely controlled by the executive. The latter undermines the separation of powers, as it creates a critical financial dependence of the judiciary. The proper national wealth distribution including the government spending on the judiciary is subject of the [[constitutional economics]]. 
It is important to distinguish between the two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the government (through budget planning and various privileges), and the private. <ref>{{cite book |first= Peter |last=Barenboim |title= Defining the rules |publisher= The European Lawyer |volume= Issue 90 |date=October 2009}}</ref> . 

===Police===. 
{{main|Police corruption}}
Police corruption is a specific form of [[police misconduct]] designed to obtain financial benefits, other personal gain, and/or career advancement for a police officer or officers in exchange for not pursuing, or selectively pursuing, an investigation or arrest. One common form of police corruption is soliciting and/or accepting [[bribe]]s in exchange for not reporting organized drug or prostitution rings or other illegal activities. Another example is police officers flouting the police [[code of conduct]] in order to secure convictions of suspects — for example, through the use of [[falsified evidence]]. More rarely, police officers may deliberately and systematically participate in [[organized crime]] themselves. In most major cities, there are [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs]] sections to investigate suspected police corruption or misconduct. Similar entities include the British [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]].  . 

==Systemic corruption==. 
Systemic corruption (or endemic corruption<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.u4.no/glossary/|title=Glossary|publisher=U4 Anti-Corruption Resource Centre|accessdate=26 June 2011}}</ref>) is corruption which is primarily due to a weaknesses of an organisation or process. It can be contrasted with individual officials or agents who act corruptly within the system.  . 

Factors which encourage systemic corruption include [[conflict of interest | conflicting incentives]], [[discretion|discretionary powers]]; [[monopoly (disambiguation)|monopolistic powers]]; lack of [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]]; low pay; and a culture of [[impunity]]. <ref>{{citation |title=Diagnosis corruption| pages=135–136 |author=Lorena Alcazar, Raul Andrade |year=2001 |isbn=9781931003117}}</ref> Specific acts of corruption include "bribery, extortion, and embezzlement" in a system where "corruption becomes the rule rather than the exception."<ref>{{cite book|last=Znoj|first=Heinzpeter|editor=Monique Nuijten, Gerhard Anders|title=Corruption and the secret of law: a legal anthropological perspective|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=P52bOZFExesC&pg=PA53|year=2009|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=9780754676829|pages=53–54|chapter=Deep Corruption in Indonesia: Discourses, Practices, Histories}}</ref> Scholars distinguish between centralized and decentralized systemic corruption, depending on which level of state or government corruption takes place; in countries such as the [[Post-Soviet states]] both types occur. <ref>{{cite book|last=Legvold|first=Robert|editor=Robert I.

==Philosophy==. 
Frequently in philosophical discussions, corruption takes the form of contrasting a pure spiritual form with a corrupted manifestation in the physical world.  Many philosophers, in fact, have regarded the physical world as inevitably corrupt ([[Plato]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} being the most famous example of this school of thought). The [[Book of Genesis]] 6:12 similarly describes a world before [[Noah's Ark|the flood]] where 'everyone on earth was corrupt' ([[New Living Translation|NLT]]).  . 

Another philosophical use of the term "corruption" is in opposition to "generation," as in [[Aristotle's]] book ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'' also known as ''On Coming to Be and Passing Away''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} In this sense, corruption is the process of ceasing to exist and is closely related to the concept of dying given certain views about the nature of living things. In a moral sense, corruption generally refers to [[decadence]] or [[hedonism]]. In theological or political debates, certain viewpoints are sometimes accused of being corruptions of orthodox systems of belief, which is to say, they are accused of having deviated from some older correct view.  .
