'''Ancient Greek boxing''' ({{lang-el|Πυγμαχία}} - ''Pygmachia'', "fist fighting") dates back to at least the eighth century BC ([[Homer|Homer's]] ''[[Iliad]]''), and was practiced in a variety of social contexts in different Greek city-states. Most extant sources about ancient Greek [[boxing]] are fragmentary or legendary, making it difficult to reconstruct the rules, customs and history surrounding this activity in great detail. Still, it is clear that gloved boxing bouts were a significant part of ancient Greek athletic culture throughout the early classical period.  .

There is archeological and artistic evidence of ancient Greek boxing (''πύξ'' - ''pux''<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpu%2Fc1 πύξ], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> or ''πυμή'' - ''pugme''<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpugmh%2F πυγμή], 
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> in [[Ancient Greek language|Αncient Greek]]) as early as the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] periods. There are numerous legends about the origins of boxing in [[Greece]]. One legend holds that the heroic ruler [[Theseus]] invented a form of boxing in which two men sat face to face and beat each other with their fists until one of them was killed. In time, the boxers began to fight while standing and wearing gloves (with spikes) and wrappings on their arms below the elbows, but otherwise they fought naked.  . 

According to the ''Iliad'', Mycenaean warriors included boxing among their competitions honoring the fallen, though it is possible that the Homeric epics reflect later Greek culture. Boxing was among the contests held in memorial of [[Achilles]]' slain friend Patroclus, toward the end of the Trojan war. It was in commemoration of Patroclus that the Greeks later introduced boxing (''pygme / pygmachia'') to the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] in 688 BC. Participants trained on punching bags (called a korykos). Fighters wore leather straps (called himantes) over their hands (leaving the fingers free), wrists, and sometimes breast, to protect themselves from injury. There was no protection for the face or head.  . 

The scholar and historian [[Philostratus]] maintained that boxing was originally developed in The city state spartas also located in Greece. Some believed zues fought in war thatin order to harden warriors’ faces for battle. The early Spartans believed helmets were unnecessary and boxing prepared them for the inevitable blows to the head they would receive in battle. <ref>Swaddling, Judith.  The Ancient Olympic Games.  2nd ed.  Austin: University of Texas
Press, 1999. </ref> However, Spartans never participated in the competitive aspect of boxing, believing the means of defeat to be dishonorable. <ref>Craig, Steve.  Sports and Games of the Ancients.  Sports and Games Through History

Until around 500 BC [[himantes]] were used as protection for the knuckles and hand. They were thongs of ox hide approximately 3 to 3.7 meters long that were wrapped around the hands and knuckles numerous times.  . 

In around 400 BC [[sphairai]] were introduced. The sphairai were very similar to himantes. The only notable difference was that they contained a padded interior when wrapped around the hands and the exterior of the thong was notably more rigid and hard. <ref>Swaddling, ''op. cit.''</ref> . 

Soon after the implementation of the [[sphairai]], the [[oxys]] were introduced to boxing. They consisted of several thick leather bands encircling the hand, wrist, and forearm. A band of fleece was placed on the forearm to wipe away sweat. Leather braces extended up the forearm to give greater support when punching and the knuckles were reinforced with leather as well. <ref>Miller, Stephen G.  Ancient Greek Athletics.  New Haven and London: Yale University
Press, 2004. </ref> . 

Korykos were the equivalent to modern punching bags. They were used for practice in the [[Palaestra]] and were filled with sand, flour, or [[millet]].  .
