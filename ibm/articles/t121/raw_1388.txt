Controversy exists about whether the definition of concussion should include only those injuries in which [[unconsciousness|loss of consciousness]] occurs. <ref name="Pearce"/> .

===Grading systems===. 
{{Main|Concussion grading systems}}
At least 41 systems exist to measure the severity, or grade, of a mild head injury,<ref name=AndersonT/> and there is little agreement among professionals about which is the best. <ref name=cantu01>
{{Cite journal|author=Cantu RC |year=2001 |pmc=155413 |title=Posttraumatic Retrograde and Anterograde Amnesia: Pathophysiology and Implications in Grading and Safe Return to Play |journal=Journal of Athletic Training |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=244–8 |pmid=12937491
}}
</ref> Several of the systems use loss of consciousness and amnesia as the primary determinants of the severity of the concussion. <ref name=cantu01/>  . 

In the past, the decision about when to allow athletes to return to contact sports was frequently based on the grade of concussion. However current research and recommendations by professional organizations such as the National Athletic Trainers Association recommend not using these grading systems for determination of severity of injury or for making return to play decisions. Every concussion and symptoms are different for each person. Someone could have symptoms from each category, which makes it hard to know where one would fit in this system. <ref name="No concussion is the same">{{cite journal|last=McKeag|first=Douglas B.|title=Understanding Sports-Related Concussion Coming Into Focus but Still Fuzzy|journal=The Journal of the American Medical Association|date=19|year=2003|month=November|volume=290|issue=19|pages=2604-2605|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org.proxy1.lib.uwo.ca:2048/content/290/19/2604.full.pdf+html|accessdate=March 12, 2012}}</ref>  Injured athletes are prohibited from returning to play before they are symptom-free during rest and exertion and neuropsychological tests are normal again.

==Mechanism==. 
[[Image:Gatica1.png|thumb|Rotational force is key in concussion. Punches in [[boxing]] deliver more rotational force to the head than impacts in sports such as [[American football]], and boxing carries a higher risk of concussion than football. <ref name=Pellman/>]] . 

The [[human brain|brain]] is surrounded by [[cerebrospinal fluid]], one of the functions of which is to protect it from light trauma, but more severe impacts or the forces associated with rapid acceleration may not be absorbed by this cushion. <ref name=Shaw02/>  Concussion may be caused by impact [[force]]s, in which the head strikes or is struck by something, or impulsive forces, in which the head moves without itself being subject to [[blunt trauma]] (for example, when the chest hits something and the head snaps forward). <ref name=sivak/> . 

Forces may cause linear, rotational, or angular movement of the brain, or a combination of these types of motion. <ref name=sivak/> In rotational movement, the head turns around its center of gravity, and in angular movement it turns on an axis not through its center of gravity. <ref name=sivak/>  The amount of rotational force is thought to be the major type of force to cause concussion<ref name=Poirier/> and the largest component in its severity. <ref name=AndersonT/>  Studies with athletes have shown that the amount of force and the location of the impact are not necessarily correlated to the severity of the concussion or its symptoms, and have called into question the threshold for concussion previously thought to exist at around 70–75[[G-force|g]]. <ref name=Guskiewicz>

</ref> Though these events are thought to interfere with neuronal and brain function, the [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes that follow concussion are reversed in a large majority of affected [[brain cell]]s; however a few cells may die after the injury. <ref name=Iverson2005/> . 

Included in the cascade of events unleashed in the brain by concussion is impaired [[neurotransmission]], loss of regulation of [[ion]]s, deregulation of energy use and cellular metabolism, and a reduction in [[cerebral blood flow]]. <ref name=Iverson2005/> Excitatory [[neurotransmitter]]s, chemicals such as [[glutamate]] that serve to stimulate nerve cells, are released in excessive amounts as the result of the injury. <ref name=Team/> The resulting cellular excitation causes [[action potential|neurons to fire]] excessively. <ref name=GizaHovda>

</ref>  This creates an imbalance of ions such as [[potassium in biology|potassium]] and [[calcium in biology|calcium]] across the cell membranes of neurons (a process like [[excitotoxicity]]). <ref name=Iverson2005/> Since the neuron firing involves a net influx of [[positive charge|positively charged]] ions into the cell, the ionic imbalance causes cells to have a more positive [[membrane potential]] (i.e. it leads to neuronal [[depolarization]]). This depolarization in turn causes [[Ion transporter|ion pump]]s that serve to restore [[resting potential]] within cells to work more than they normally do. <ref name=Iverson2005/>  This increased need for energy leads cells to require greater-than-usual amounts of [[glucose]], which is made into [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], an important source of energy for cells. <ref name=Iverson2005/>  The brain may stay in this state of [[hypermetabolism]] for days or weeks. <ref name=Heegaard07/> At the same time, cerebral blood flow is relatively reduced for unknown reasons,<ref name=Bowen03/> though the reduction in blood flow is not as severe as it is in [[ischemia]]. <ref name=Iverson2005/>  Thus cells get less glucose than they normally do, which causes an "energy crisis". <ref name=Bowen03/> . 

Concurrently with these processes, the activity of [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] may be reduced, which causes cells to rely on [[anaerobic metabolism]] to produce energy, which increases levels of the byproduct [[lactic acid|lactate]]. <ref name=Iverson2005/> . 

For a period of minutes to days after a concussion, the brain is especially vulnerable to changes in [[intracranial pressure]], blood flow, and [[hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]]. <ref name=Bowen03/>  According to [[animal study|studies performed on animals]] (which are not always applicable to humans), large numbers of neurons can die during this period in response to slight, normally innocuous changes in blood flow. <ref name=Bowen03/> .

The debate over whether concussion is a functional or structural phenomenon is ongoing. <ref name=McCrory/> Structural damage has been found in the mildly traumatically injured brains of animals, but it is not clear whether these changes would be applicable to humans. <ref name=Pearce/> Such changes in brain structure could be responsible for certain symptoms such as visual disturbances, but other sets of symptoms, especially those of a psychological nature, are more likely to be caused by reversible pathophysiological changes in cellular function that occur after concussion, such as alterations in neurons' biochemistry. <ref name=AndersonT/> These reversible changes could also explain why dysfunction is frequently temporary. <ref name=McCrory/> A task force of head injury experts called the Concussion In Sport Group met in 2001 and decided that "concussion may result in neuropathological changes but the acute clinical symptoms largely reflect a functional disturbance rather than structural injury."<ref name=aubry/> .

Chronic [[encephalopathy]] is an example of the cumulative damage that can occur as the result of multiple concussions or less severe blows to the head.

===Second-impact syndrome===. 
{{Main|Second-impact syndrome}}
Second-impact syndrome, in which the brain swells dangerously after a minor blow, may occur in very rare cases. The condition may develop in people who receive a second blow days or weeks after an initial concussion, before its symptoms have gone away. <ref name=Bowen03/>  No one is certain of the cause of this often fatal complication, but it is commonly thought that the swelling occurs because the brain's [[arteriole]]s lose the ability to regulate their diameter, causing a loss of control over cerebral blood flow. <ref name=moser/> As the brain [[Swelling (medical)|swells]], intracranial pressure rapidly rises. <ref name=CookSchweer/> The brain can [[brain herniation|herniate]], and the brain stem can fail within five minutes. <ref name=Bowen03/> Except in boxing, all cases have occurred in athletes under age&nbsp;20. <ref name=Team/>  Due to the very small number of documented cases, the diagnosis is controversial, and doubt exists about its validity. <ref name=McCroryP01>

Most cases of traumatic brain injury are concussions. A World Health Organization (WHO) study estimated that between 70 and 90% of head injuries that receive treatment are mild. <ref name=CassidyWHO/>  However, due to underreporting and to the widely varying definitions of concussion and MTBI, it is difficult to estimate how common the condition is. <ref name=Petchprapai07>

[[Image:HippocraticOath.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Hippocratic Corpus]] mentioned concussion. <ref name=Masferrer/>]]

</ref> In the 13th&nbsp;century, the physician [[Lanfranc of Milan]]'s ''Chiurgia Magna'' described concussion as brain "commotion", also recognizing a difference between concussion and other types of traumatic brain injury (though many of his contemporaries did not), and discussing the transience of post-concussion symptoms as a result of temporary loss of function from the injury. <ref name=McCrory/> In the 14th&nbsp;century, the surgeon [[Guy de Chauliac]] pointed out the relatively good prognosis of concussion as compared to more severe types of head trauma such as [[skull fracture]]s and [[penetrating head trauma]]. <ref name=McCrory/> In the 16th&nbsp;century, the term "concussion" came into use, and symptoms such as confusion, lethargy, and memory problems were described. <ref name=McCrory/>  The 16th&nbsp;century physician [[Ambroise Paré]] used the term ''commotio cerebri'',<ref name=sivak/> as well as "shaking of the brain", "commotion", and "concussion". <ref name=Masferrer/> . 

[[Image:Guillaume Dupuytren.jpg|thumb|right|[[Guillaume Dupuytren]] distinguished between concussion and unconsciousness associated with [[brain contusion]]. <ref name=Masferrer/>]]
Until the 17th&nbsp;century, concussion was usually described by its clinical features, but after the invention of the microscope, more physicians began exploring underlying physical and structural mechanisms. <ref name=McCrory/> However, the prevailing view in the 17th century was that the injury did not result from physical damage, and this view continued to be widely held throughout the 18th&nbsp;century. <ref name=McCrory/>  The word "concussion" was used at the time to describe the state of unconsciousness and other functional problems that resulted from the impact, rather than a physiological condition. <ref name=McCrory/> . 

In 1839, Guillaume Dupuytren described brain contusions, which involve many small hemorrhages, as ''contusio cerebri'' and showed the difference between unconsciousness associated with damage to the brain [[parenchyma]] and that due to concussion, without such injury. <ref name=Masferrer/>  In 1941, animal experiments showed that no [[macroscopic]] damage occurs in concussion. <ref name=Masferrer/><ref name="Denny-Brown">
