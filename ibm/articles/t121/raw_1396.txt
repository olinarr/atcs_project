The '''Marquess of Queensberry rules''' is a code of generally accepted rules in the sport of [[boxing]]. They were named so because [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry]] publicly endorsed the code,<ref>Harris, Brian (2008) ''Intolerance: divided societies on trial'' p.182. Wildy, Simmonds & Hill Publishing, 2008 </ref> although they were written by a sportsman named [[John Graham Chambers]]. The code of rules on which modern boxing is based, the Queensberry rules were the first to mention gloves in boxing. <ref name=ERI>Eric Dunning [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xMVorY12iCQC&pg=PA59&dq=the+Queensberry+rules+for+the+sport+of+boxing&hl=en&ei=VDcCTeH-NMaWOtyx7aYB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CFgQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=the%20Queensberry%20rules%20for%20the%20sport%20of%20boxing&f=false Sport matters: sociological studies of sport, violence, and civilization] Routledge, 1999</ref> The Queensberry rules are intended for use in both professional and amateur boxing matches, thus separating it from the less popular American Fair Play Rules, which were strictly intended for amateur matches. In popular culture the term is sometimes used to refer to a sense of [[sportsmanship]] and [[fair play]].  . 

==History==. 
The boxing code was written by [[John Graham Chambers]] a Welshman, and drafted in London in 1865, before being published in 1867 as "the Queensberry rules for the sport of boxing". <ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Queensberry_Rules.aspx#1-1O214:QueensberryRules-full Queensberry Rules] The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</ref><ref>William Joseph Baker (1998) [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rkuAiv3LoR4C&pg=PA172&dq=queensbury+rules&hl=en&ei=fTYCTYTDDoOEOsKotKYB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&q=queensbury%20rules&f=false Sports in the Western world] Retrieved 2010-12-10</ref> This code of rules superseded the [[Revised London Prize Ring rules]] (1853), which had themselves replaced the original [[London Prize Ring rules]] (1743) of [[Jack Broughton]]. This version persuaded boxers that "you must not fight simply to win; no holds barred is not the way; you must win by the rules" (17, sect. 5, pt. 1).  . 

One early prize fighter who fought under Marquess of Queensberry rules was [[Jem Mace]], who won the English heavyweight title under these rules in 1861. In 1889, the Queensberry rules came into use in the United States and Canada. <ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nM4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA67&dq=queensbury+rules&hl=en&ei=WTQCTeucJcWBOu6WxKYB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CDkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=queensbury%20rules&f=false Black Belt Oct 1999] Retrieved 2010-12-10</ref>  .
