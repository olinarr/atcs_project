<!--Definition and classification -->
'''Traumatic brain injury''' ('''TBI'''), also known as '''intracranial injury''', occurs when an external force [[physical trauma|traumatically injures]] the [[brain]].  TBI can be classified based on severity, mechanism ([[closed head injury|closed]] or [[penetrating head injury]]), or other features (e.g., occurring in a specific location or over a widespread area).  ''[[Head injury]]'' usually refers to TBI, but is a broader category because it can involve damage to structures other than the brain, such as the scalp and skull.  . 

<!--Causes, epidemiology, prevention-->
TBI is a [[list of causes of death by rate|major cause of death and disability worldwide]], especially in children and young adults. Causes include falls, vehicle accidents, and violence. Prevention measures include use of technology to protect those suffering from automobile accidents, such as seat belts and sports or motorcycle helmets, as well as efforts to reduce the number of automobile accidents, such as safety education programs and enforcement of traffic laws.  . 

<!--mechanism, pathophysiology, research-->
Brain trauma can be caused by a direct impact or by acceleration alone.  In addition to the damage caused at the moment of injury, brain trauma causes ''secondary injury'', a variety of events that take place in the minutes and days following the injury. These processes, which include alterations in [[cerebral blood flow]] and the [[intracranial pressure|pressure within the skull]], contribute substantially to the damage from the initial injury.  . 

<!--History, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, complications-->
TBI can cause a host of physical, cognitive, social, emotional, and behavioral effects, and outcome can range from complete recovery to permanent [[disability]] or death. The 20th&nbsp;century saw critical developments in diagnosis and treatment that decreased [[mortality rate|death rates]] and improved outcome. These include imaging techniques such as [[computed tomography]] and [[magnetic resonance imaging]]. Depending on the injury, treatment required may be minimal or may include interventions such as medications and emergency surgery. [[Physical therapy]], [[speech therapy]], [[recreation therapy]], and [[occupational therapy]] may be employed for rehabilitation.  .

<!-- DEFINITION -->
Traumatic brain injury is defined as damage to the brain resulting from external mechanical force, such as rapid acceleration or deceleration, impact, [[blast injury|blast]] waves, or penetration by a projectile. <ref name="Maas08" /> Brain function is temporarily or permanently impaired and structural damage may or may not be detectable with current technology. <ref name="Parikh07">{{ cite journal |author=Parikh S, Koch M, Narayan RK |title= Traumatic brain injury |journal=International Anesthesiology Clinics |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages= 119–35 |year=2007 |pmid= 17622833 |doi=10.1097/AIA.0b013e318078cfe7 |pmc= |url= }}</ref> .

Focal injuries often produce [[Focal neurologic symptom|symptoms related to the functions of the damaged area]]. <ref name="LaPlaca07"/> Research shows that the most common areas to have focal lesions in non-penetrating traumatic brain injury are the [[orbitofrontal cortex]] (the lower surface of the frontal lobes) and the anterior [[temporal lobes]], areas that are involved in social behavior, emotion regulation, olfaction, and decision-making, hence the common social/emotional and judgment deficits following moderate-severe TBI. <ref name="Mattson90">{{cite journal |last=Mattson |first= A.

<!--CONTUSION-->
One type of focal injury, [[cerebral laceration]], occurs when the tissue is cut or torn. <ref name="Hardman02" /> Such tearing is common in [[orbitofrontal cortex]] in particular, because of bony protrusions on the interior skull ridge above the eyes. <ref name="Mattson90"/>  In a similar injury, [[cerebral contusion]] (bruising of brain tissue),<!-- <ref name="Parikh07" /> --> blood is mixed among tissue. <ref name="Valadka04" /> In contrast, [[intracranial hemorrhage]] involves bleeding that is not mixed with tissue. <ref name="Hardman02" /> . 

<!--HEMORRHAGE / HEMATOMA-->
Hematomas, also focal lesions, are collections of blood in or around the brain that can result from hemorrhage. <ref name="Parikh07" /> [[Intracerebral hemorrhage]], with bleeding in the brain tissue itself, is an intra-axial lesion. Extra-axial lesions include [[epidural hematoma]], [[subdural hematoma]], [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]], and [[intraventricular hemorrhage]]. <ref name="Barkley06">{{cite book |author= Barkley JM, Morales D, Hayman LA, Diaz-Marchan PJ |editor=Zasler ND, Katz DI, Zafonte RD |chapter=Static neuroimaging in the evaluation of TBI |title=Brain Injury Medicine: Principles and Practice |publisher=Demos Medical Publishing |location= |year=2006 |pages=140–43 |isbn=1-888799-93-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=|url=http://books.google.com/?id=yplFkKimNcYC&pg=PA134&lpg=PA134&dq=define+Intra-axial+hematoma}}</ref> Epidural hematoma involves bleeding into the area between the skull and the [[dura mater]], the outermost of the three [[meninges|membranes]] surrounding the brain. <ref name="Parikh07" /> In subdural hematoma, bleeding occurs between the dura and the [[arachnoid mater]]. <ref name="Valadka04" /> Subarachnoid hemorrhage involves bleeding into the space between the arachnoid membrane and the [[pia mater]]. <ref name="Valadka04" /> Intraventricular hemorrhage occurs when there is bleeding in the [[ventricular system|ventricles]]. <ref name="Barkley06" /> .

==Mechanism==. 
===Physical forces===. 
[[File:Contrecoup.svg|right|thumb|Ricochet of the brain within the skull may account for the coup-contrecoup phenomenon. <ref name="Shaw02" />]]
The type, direction, intensity, and duration of forces all contribute to the characteristics and severity TBI. <ref name="Maas08" /> Forces that may contribute to TBI include angular, [[Rotational force|rotational]], [[shear force|shear]], and [[translational force]]s. <ref name="Hardman02" /> . 

<!--ACCELERATION-->
Even in the absence of an impact, significant acceleration or deceleration of the head can cause TBI; however in most cases a combination of impact and acceleration is probably to blame. <ref name="Hardman02" /> Forces involving the head striking or being struck by something, termed ''contact'' or ''impact loading'', are the cause of most focal injuries, and movement of the brain within the skull, termed ''noncontact'' or ''inertial loading'', usually causes diffuse injuries. <ref name="Saatman08" /> The violent shaking of an infant that causes [[shaken baby syndrome]] commonly manifests as diffuse injury. <ref name="committee">{{cite journal |author=American Academy of Pediatrics: Committee on Child Abuse and Neglect |title=Shaken baby syndrome: Rotational cranial injuries.

Secondary injury events include damage to the [[blood–brain barrier]], release of factors that cause [[inflammation]], [[free radical]] overload, excessive release of the [[neurotransmitter]] [[glutamate]] ([[excitotoxicity]]), influx of calcium and sodium ions into [[neuron]]s, and dysfunction of [[mitochondria]]. <ref name="Park08" /> Injured axons in the brain's [[white matter]] may [[axotomy|separate]] from their cell bodies as a result of secondary injury,<ref name="Park08" /> potentially killing those neurons. Other factors in secondary injury are changes in the [[cerebral blood flow|blood flow to the brain]]; [[ischemia]] (insufficient blood flow); cerebral [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] (insufficient oxygen in the brain); [[cerebral edema]] (swelling of the brain); and raised [[intracranial pressure]] (the pressure within the skull). <ref name="Valadka05">{{ cite book|editor=Valadka AB, Andrews BT |author=Scalea TM| chapter=Does it matter how head injured patients are resuscitated? |year=2005 |title=Neurotrauma: Evidence-based Answers to Common Questions |publisher=Thieme | isbn=3131307811 |pages=3–4 }}</ref> Intracranial pressure may rise due to swelling or a [[Mass effect (medicine)|mass effect]] from a lesion, such as a hemorrhage. <ref name="Salomone04">{{ cite book |author=Salomone JP, Frame SB |chapter=Prehospital care |editor = Moore EJ, Feliciano DV, Mattox KL |title=Trauma |publisher=McGraw-Hill, Medical Pub.

Since the pterion is so weak this type of injury can easily occur and can be secondary due to trauma to other parts of the skull where the impact forces spreads to the pterion.  . 

==Diagnosis==. 
[[File:Epidural hematoma arrow.png|left|thumb|CT scan showing epidural hematoma (arrow)<!-- This is not from trauma -->]] . 

Diagnosis is suspected based on lesion circumstances and clinical evidence, most prominently a [[neurological examination]], for example checking whether the pupils constrict normally in response to light and assigning a Glasgow Coma Score. <ref name="Valadka04" /> Neuroimaging helps in determining the diagnosis and prognosis and in deciding what treatments to give. <ref name="Zink01" /> . 

<!-- CT -->
The preferred radiologic test in the emergency setting is [[computed tomography]] (CT): it is quick, accurate, and widely available. <ref name="Barr07" /> Followup CT scans may be performed later to determine whether the injury has progressed. <ref name="Maas08" /> . 

<!--MRI-->
[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) can show more detail than CT, and can add information about expected outcome in the long term. <ref name="Valadka04" /> It is more useful than CT for detecting injury characteristics such as diffuse axonal injury in the <!-- subacute and chronic --> longer term. <ref name="Maas08" /> However, MRI is not used in the emergency setting for reasons including its relative inefficacy in detecting bleeds and fractures, its lengthy acquisition of images, the inaccessibility of the patient in the machine, and its incompatibility with metal items used in emergency care. <ref name="Valadka04" /> . 

<!-- OTHER NEUROIMAGING -->
Other techniques may be used to confirm a particular diagnosis. [[X-ray]]s are still used for head trauma, but evidence suggests they are not useful; head injuries are either so mild that they do not need imaging or severe enough to merit the more accurate CT. <ref name="Barr07">{{cite book|author= Barr RM, Gean AD, Le TH |editor=Brant WE, Helms CA |chapter=Craniofacial trauma |title=Fundamentals of Diagnostic Radiology |publisher=Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |year=2007 |isbn=0-7817-6135-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=2008-11-17 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Sossht2t5XwC&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=extra-axial+intra-axial |page= 55}}</ref> [[Angiography]] may be used to detect blood vessel pathology when risk factors such as penetrating head trauma are involved. <ref name="Maas08" /> [[Functional imaging]] can measure cerebral blood flow or metabolism, inferring neuronal activity in specific regions and potentially helping to predict outcome. <ref name="Coles07">{{cite journal | author = Coles JP | title = Imaging after brain injury | journal = British Journal of Anaesthesia | volume = 99 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–60 | year = 2007 | month = July | pmid = 17573394 | doi = 10.1093/bja/aem141 | url = http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17573394 }}</ref> [[Electroencephalography]] and [[transcranial doppler]] may also be used. The most sensitive physical measure to date is the quantitative EEG which has documented an 80% to 100% ability in discriminating between normals and traumatic brain injured subjects. <ref> Thornton, K.

<!-- NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT -->
[[Neuropsychological assessment]] can be performed to evaluate the long-term [[cognitive deficit|cognitive sequels]] and to aid in the planning of the [[Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|rehabilitation]]. <ref name="Zink01" /> Instruments range from short measures of general mental functioning to complete batteries formed of different domain-specific [[Neuropsychological test|tests]].  . 

==Prevention==. 
[[File:2006 Pro Bowl tackle.jpg|right|thumb|Protective sports equipment such as helmets can protect athletes from head injury.]] . 

Since a major cause of TBI are vehicle accidents, their prevention or the amelioration of their consequences can both reduce the incidence and gravity of TBI. In accidents, damage can be reduced by use of seat belts, child safety seats<ref name="cdcfacts" /><!-- endorses motorcycle helmets too --> and motorcycle helmets,<ref name="liu08">{{cite journal |author=Liu BC, Ivers R, Norton R, Boufous S, Blows S, Lo SK |title=Helmets for preventing injury in motorcycle riders |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD004333 |year=2008 |pmid=18254047 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004333.pub3 |editor1-last=Liu |editor1-first=Bette C }}</ref> and presence of [[Roll cage|roll bars]] and airbags. <ref name="Hardman02" /> Education programs exist to lower the number of crashes. <ref name="Zink01" /> In addition, changes to public policy and safety laws can be made; these include speed limits, seat belt and helmet laws, and road engineering practices. <ref name="Park08" /> . 

<!--SPORTS-->
Changes to common practices in sports have also been discussed. An increase in use of helmets could reduce the incidence of TBI. <ref name="Park08" /> Due to the possibility that repeatedly "heading" a ball practicing soccer could cause cumulative brain injury, the idea of introducing protective headgear for players has been proposed. <ref name="McCrory03">{{cite journal |author=McCrory PR |title=Brain injury and heading in soccer |journal=BMJ |volume=327 |issue=7411 |pages=351–52 |year=2003 |month=August |pmid=12919964 |pmc=1126775 |doi=10.1136/bmj.327.7411.351 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/327/7411/351?etoc}}</ref> Improved equipment design can enhance safety; softer baseballs reduce head injury risk. <ref name="McIntosh05">{{cite journal |author=McIntosh AS, McCrory P |title=Preventing head and neck injury |journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine (Free registration required) |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=314–18 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=15911597 |pmc=1725244 |doi=10.1136/bjsm.2005.018200 |url=http://bjsm.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/39/6/314 }}</ref> Rules against dangerous types of contact, such as "spear tackling" in [[American football]], when one player tackles another head first, may also reduce head injury rates. <ref name="McIntosh05" /> .

Falls can be avoided by installing grab bars in bathrooms and handrails on stairways; removing tripping hazards such as throw rugs; or installing window guards and safety gates at the top and bottom of stairs around young children. <ref name="cdcfacts" /> Playgrounds with shock-absorbing surfaces such as mulch or sand also prevent head injuries. <ref name="cdcfacts" /> Child abuse prevention is another tactic; programs exist to prevent [[shaken baby syndrome]] by educating about the dangers of shaking children. <ref name="Elovic05">{{ cite book |author=Elovic E, Zafonte R |chapter=Prevention |editor=Silver JM, McAllister TW, Yudofsky SC |title=Textbook of Traumatic Brain Injury |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |location=Washington, DC |year=2005| isbn=1-58562-105-6 |page= 740 }}</ref> Gun safety, including keeping guns unloaded and locked, is another preventative measure. <ref name="Crooks07">{{cite journal |author=Crooks CY, Zumsteg JM, Bell KR |title=Traumatic brain injury: A review of practice management and recent advances |journal=Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=681–710 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=17967360 |doi=10.1016/j.pmr.2007.06.005 }}</ref> Studies on the effect of laws that aim to control access to guns in the United States have been insufficient to determine their effectiveness preventing number of deaths or injuries. <ref name="pmid15698747">{{cite journal |author=Hahn RA |title=Firearms laws and the reduction of violence: a systematic review |journal=Am J Prev Med |volume=28 |issue=2 Suppl 1 |pages=40–71 |year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15698747 |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2004.10.005 |url= |author-separator=, |author2=Bilukha O |author3=Crosby A |display-authors=3 |last4=Fullilove |first4=Mindy T. |last5=Liberman |first5=Akiva |last6=Moscicki |first6=Eve |last7=Snyder |first7=Susan |last8=Tuma |first8=Farris |last9=Briss |first9=Peter A. }}</ref> . 

<!--BIOCHEMICAL DAMAGE PREVENTION VIA OMEGA-3 DHA-->

==Treatment==. 
It is important to begin [[emergency]] treatment within the so-called "[[golden hour (medicine)|golden hour]]" following the injury. <ref name="Kluger">Kluger, Jeffrey. "Dealing with Brain Injuries. ''Time Magazine,'' April 6, 2009, p. 57. Online: http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1887856,00.html. Accessed: May 1, 2009</ref> People with moderate to severe injuries are likely to receive treatment in an [[intensive care unit]] followed by a [[neurosurgery|neurosurgical]] ward. <ref name="TBI:HTR" /> Treatment depends on the recovery stage of the patient. In the acute stage the primary aim of the medical personnel is to stabilize the patient and focus on preventing further injury because little can be done to reverse the initial damage caused by trauma. <ref name="TBI:HTR" /> Rehabilitation is the main treatment for the subacute and chronic stages of recovery. <ref name="TBI:HTR" /> International [[clinical guideline]]s have been proposed with the aim of guiding decisions in TBI treatment, as defined by an authoritative examination of current [[evidence-based medicine|evidence]]. <ref name="Maas08" /> . 

===Acute stage===. 
Certain facilities are equipped to handle TBI better than others; initial measures include transporting patients to an appropriate treatment center. <ref name="Salomone04" /><ref name="Greenwald03" /> Both during transport and in hospital the primary concerns are ensuring proper oxygen supply, maintaining adequate cerebral blood flow, and controlling raised [[intracranial pressure]] (ICP),<ref name="Parikh07" /> since high ICP deprives the brain of badly needed blood flow<ref name="Moppett07" /> and can cause deadly [[brain herniation]].

Improvement of neurological function usually occurs for two or more years after the trauma. For many years it was believed that recovery was fastest during the first six months, but there is no evidence to support this.

For example, work has been done to design a device to monitor oxygenation that could be attached to a probe placed into the brain—such probes are currently used to monitor ICP. <ref name="Marshall00" /> Research is also planned to clarify factors correlated to outcome in TBI and to determine in which cases it is best to perform CT scans and surgical procedures. <ref name="Yates07">{{cite journal |author=Yates D, Aktar R, Hill J; Guideline Development Group. |title=Assessment, investigation, and early management of head injury: Summary of NICE guidance |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=335 |issue=7622 |pages=719–20 |year= 2007 |pmid=17916856 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39331.702951.47 |pmc=2001047 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/335/7622/719}}</ref> .
