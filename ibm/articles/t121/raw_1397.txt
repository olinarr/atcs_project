'''Muhammad Ali''' (born '''Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr.'''; January 17, 1942) is an American former professional [[boxing|boxer]],<ref name="boxrec1">{{cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=000180&cat=boxer |title=Muhammad Ali – Boxer |publisher=Boxrec.com |accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> philanthropist<ref name="biography1">{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/articles/Muhammad-Ali-9181165?part=0 |title=Muhammad Ali Biography |publisher=Biography.com |date=January 17, 1942 |accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> and [[social activist]]. <ref name="biography1"/> Considered a [[cultural icon]], Ali was both idolized and vilified. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://history1900s.about.com/od/people/a/muhammadali_2.htm |title=Muhammad Ali – Biography of Muhammad Ali – Page 2 |publisher=History1900s.about.com |accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Cagle |first=Jess |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1001498,00.html |title=Ali: Lord of the Ring |work=TIME |date=December 17, 2001 |accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> . 

Originally known as Cassius Clay, Ali changed his name after joining the [[Nation of Islam]] in 1964, subsequently converting to [[Sunni Islam]] in 1975, and more recently practicing [[Sufism]]. <ref>{{cite web|author=BY: Interview by Deborah Caldwell |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Islam/2005/02/Muhammad-Alis-New-Spiritual-Quest.aspx |title=Muhammad Ali has embraced Sufi Islam and is on a new spiritual quest |publisher=Beliefnet.com |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}</ref> In 1967, three years after Ali had won the [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|World Heavyweight Championship]], he was publicly vilified for his refusal to be conscripted into the [[U.S. military]], based on his religious beliefs and opposition to the [[Vietnam War]]. Ali stated, "I ain't got no quarrel with them [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam|Viet Cong]]... No Viet Cong ever called me nigger" – one of the more telling remarks of the era. <ref>{{cite news|last=Plimpton |first=George |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,991256,00.html#ixzz1WkE11Voo |title=MUHAMMAD ALI: The Greatest |work=TIME |date=June 14, 1999 |accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> . 

Widespread protests against the [[Vietnam War]] had not yet begun, but with that one phrase, Ali articulated the reason to oppose the war for a generation of young [[Americans]], and his words served as a touchstone for the [[racial]] and [[antiwar]] upheavals that would rock the 1960s. Ali's example inspired [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] – who had been reluctant to alienate the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Administration#Presidency 1963–1969|Johnson Administration]] and its support of the [[civil rights]] agenda – to voice his own opposition to the war for the first time. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/30/sports/backtalk-today-s-athletes-owe-everything-to-ali.html?pagewanted=3&src=pm |title=BACKTALK; Today's Athletes Owe Everything to Ali – Page 3 – New York Times |work=The New York Times |date=April 30, 2000 |accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> . 

Ali was eventually arrested and found guilty on draft evasion charges; he was stripped of his boxing title, and his boxing license was suspended. He was not imprisoned, but did not fight again for nearly four years while his appeal worked its way up to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], where it was eventually successful.  . 

Ali would go on to become the first and only three-time [[lineal championship|lineal]] [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|World Heavyweight Champion]].  . 

Nicknamed "The Greatest," Ali was involved in several historic [[boxing]] matches. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://espn.go.com/sports/boxing/topics/_/page/muhammad-ali | work=ESPN | title=Muhammad Ali | date=January 20, 2012 | accessdate=January 29, 2012}}</ref> Notable among these were three with rival [[Joe Frazier]], which are considered among the greatest in boxing history, and one with [[George Foreman]], where he finally regained his stripped titles seven years later. Ali was well known for his unorthodox fighting style, which he described as "float like a butterfly, sting like a bee", and employing techniques such as the Ali Shuffle and the [[rope-a-dope]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quotedb.com/quotes/3980 |title=Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. by Muhammad Ali |publisher=Quotedb.com |accessdate=December 5, 2010}}</ref> Ali had brought beauty and grace to the most uncompromising of sports and through the wonderful excesses of skill and character, he had become the most [[wikt:famous|famous]] [[sportsperson|athlete]] in the world. <ref>{{cite news|last=Plimpton |first=George |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,991256,00.html#ixzz1WjqptGlj |title=MUHAMMAD ALI: The Greatest |work=TIME |date=June 14, 1999 |accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> He was also known for his pre-match hype, where he would "[[Trash-talk|trash talk]]" opponents, often with rhymes.  .

Although Cassius Sr. was a [[Methodist]], he allowed Odessa to bring up both Cassius and his elder brother [[Rahman Ali|Rudolph "Rudy" Clay]] (later renamed Rahman Ali) as [[Baptists]]. <ref name="Hauserp14">{{Harvnb|Hauser|2004|p=14}}</ref> He is a descendant of pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] era American [[slave]]s in the [[American South]], and is predominantly of African-American descent, with some [[Irish American|Irish]] ancestry. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/boxing/1810535.stm |title=Ali has Irish ancestry |publisher=BBC News  |date=February 9, 2002 |accessdate=August 5, 2009}}</ref> . 

Clay was first directed toward boxing by the white Louisville police officer and boxing coach [[Joe E. Martin]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.articleclick.com/Article/Boxing-Legend---Muhammad-Ali/938509|title=Boxing Legend – Muhammad Ali|last=Kandel|first=Elmo|date=April 1, 2006|work=Article Click|publisher=Elmo Kandel|accessdate=March 9, 2009}}</ref> who encountered the 12-year-old fuming over a thief taking his bicycle. He told the officer he was going to "whup" the thief. The officer told him he better learn how to box first. <ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 20, 2008|url=http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring05/Shaffer/clay.html|title=Muhammad Ali|publisher=[[University of Florida]]}}</ref><!-- Editors, all of the published biographies of Muhammad Ali, and multiple published newspaper accounts, state that Joe E. Martin was his first trainer. Martin accompanied Ali to the 1960 Olympics in Rome, and multiple photos depict Ali and Martin together. If there are revisionist authorities which credit Fred Stoner, then this should be correctly cited. Caution: Several Internet articles appear to have originated from the wording of the Wikipedia article. --> For the last four years of Clay's amateur career he was trained by legendary boxing [[cutman]] [[Chuck Bodak]]. <ref>[http://ringtalk.com.lhost9.atlantic.net/index.php?action=fullnews&showcomments=1&id=1553 “GODFATHER” OF CUTMEN-CHUCK BODAK SUFFERS STROKE] September 2, 2007 by Pedro Fernandez, ringtalk.com</ref> . 

Clay won six Kentucky [[Golden Gloves]] titles, two national Golden Gloves titles, an [[Amateur Athletic Union]] National Title, and the [[Light Heavyweight]] gold medal in the [[1960 Summer Olympics]] in Rome. <ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 20, 2008 |url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/malitimeline1.html|title=Muhammad Ali Timeline|publisher=Infoplease}}</ref><ref name="Ward">[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/5/2006_5_48.shtml Nathan Ward] "'A Total Eclipse of the Sonny,'" ''American Heritage'', Oct. 2006. {{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref> Clay's amateur record was 100 wins with five losses.  . 

Ali states in his 1975 autobiography that he threw his [[Gold medal|Olympic gold medal]] into the [[Ohio River]] after being refused service at a 'whites-only' restaurant, and fighting with a white gang. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gale.cengage.com/free_resources/bhm/bio/ali_m.htm |title=Biographies: Muhammad Ali |publisher=Gale.cengage.com |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}</ref> Whether this is true is still debated, although he was given a replacement medal at a basketball intermission during the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympics in Atlanta]], where he lit the torch to start the games.  . 

=== Early professional career ===. 
After his Olympic triumph, Clay returned to Louisville to begin his professional career. There, on October 29, 1960, he won his first professional fight, a six-round decision over [[Tunney Hunsaker]], who was the police chief of [[Fayetteville, West Virginia|Fayetteville]], West Virginia.  . 

Standing at 6'3'' (1.91&nbsp;m), Clay had a highly unorthodox style for a heavyweight boxer. Rather than the normal style of carrying the hands high to defend the face, he instead relied on foot speed and quickness to avoid punches, and carried his hands low.  . 

From 1960 to 1963, the young fighter amassed a record of 19–0, with 15 knockouts. He defeated boxers such as Tony Esperti, [[Jim Robinson (boxer)|Jim Robinson]], Donnie Fleeman, Alonzo Johnson, George Logan, Willi Besmanoff, Lamar Clark (who had won his previous 40 bouts by knockout), [[Doug Jones (boxer)|Doug Jones]] and [[Henry Cooper (boxer)|Henry Cooper]].  . 

Clay built a reputation by correctly predicting the round in which he would "finish" several opponents, and by boasting before his triumphs. <ref name="greatath"/> Clay admitted he adopted the latter practice from "Gorgeous" [[George Wagner]], a popular professional wrestling champion in the [[Greater Los Angeles Area|Los Angeles area]] who drew thousands of fans. <ref name="greatath"/> Often referred to as "the man you loved to hate," George could incite the crowd with a few heated remarks, and Clay followed suit.  . 

Among Clay's victims were [[Sonny Banks]] (who knocked him down during the bout), Alejandro Lavorante, and the aged [[Archie Moore]] (a boxing legend who had fought over 200 previous fights, and who had been Clay's trainer prior to [[Angelo Dundee]]). Clay had considered continuing using Moore as a trainer following the bout, but Moore had insisted that the cocky "Louisville Lip" perform training camp chores such as sweeping and dishwashing. He considered having his idol, [[Sugar Ray Robinson]], as a manager, but instead hired Dundee.  . 

Clay first met Dundee on February 19, 1957 when the latter was in Louisville the day before a fight with light heavyweight champ [[Willie Pastrano]]. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/7470417/muhammad-ali-was-continues-greatest | work=ESPN | title=Dundee: Ali was, still is 'The Greatest' | date=January 17, 2012 | accessdate=January 17, 2012 | first1=Carlos | last1=Irusta}}</ref> The teenaged [[Golden Gloves]] winner traveled downtown to the fighter's hotel, called Dundee from the house phone, and was asked up to their room. He took advantage of the opportunity to query Dundee (who had worked with champions [[Sugar Ramos]] and [[Carmen Basilio]]) about what his fighters ate, how long they slept, how much roadwork (jogging) they did, and how long they sparred.  . 

Following his bout with Moore, Clay won a disputed 10-round decision over Doug Jones in a matchup that was named "Fight of the Year" for 1963. Clay's next fight was against [[Henry Cooper (boxer)|Henry Cooper]], who knocked Clay down with a left hook near the end of the fourth round. The fight was stopped in the fifth due to deep cuts over Cooper's eyes.  . 

Despite these close calls, Clay became the top contender for [[Sonny Liston]]'s title. However, although he had an impressive record, he was not widely expected to defeat the champ. The fight was scheduled for February 25, 1964 in Miami, Florida, but was nearly canceled when the promoter, Bill Faversham, heard that Clay had been seen around Miami and in other cities with the controversial [[Malcolm X]], a member of [[The Nation of Islam]]. Because of this, news of this association was perceived as a potential gate-killer to a bout which, given Liston's overwhelming status as the favorite to win (7–1 odds),<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=May 20, 2008 |url=http://www.saddoboxing.com/boxing-article/Sonny-Liston-v-Cassius-Clay.html |title=Boxing Classics – Sonny Liston v Cassius Clay – February&nbsp;25,&nbsp;1964 |publisher=Saddo Boxing}}</ref> had Clay's colorful persona and nonstop braggadocio as its sole appeal.  . 

Faversham confronted Clay about his association with Malcolm X (who, at the time, was actually under suspension by the Nation as a result of controversial comments made in the wake of President Kennedy's assassination). While stopping short of admitting he was a member of the Nation, Clay protested the suggested cancellation of the fight. As a compromise, Faversham asked the fighter to delay his announcement about his [[Religious conversion|conversion to Islam]] until after the fight. The incident is described in the 1975 book ''The Greatest: My Own Story'' by Ali (with Richard Durham).  . 

During the weigh-in on the day before the bout, the ever-boastful Clay, who frequently taunted Liston during the buildup by dubbing him "the big ugly bear" (among other things), declared that he would "float like a butterfly and sting like a bee," and, summarizing his strategy for avoiding Liston's assaults, said, "Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see." . 

=== First title fight and aftermath ===. 
{{Main|Muhammad Ali versus Sonny Liston}} . 

At the pre-fight weigh-in, Clay's pulse rate was around 120, more than double his norm of 54. <ref name="Liston">{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Lipsyte |title=Clay Wins Title in Seventh-Round Upset As Liston Is Halted by Shoulder Injury |url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/10/25/specials/ali-upset.html |work=New York Times |date=February 26, 1964 |accessdate=December 27, 2008}}</ref> Liston, among others, misread this as nervousness. In the opening rounds, Clay's speed kept him away from Liston's powerful head and body shots, as he used his height advantage to beat Liston to the punch with his own lightning-quick [[jab]]. <ref name="Liston" /> . 

By the third round, Clay was ahead on points and had opened a cut under Liston's eye. <ref name="Liston" /> Liston regained some ground in the fourth, as Clay was blinded by a substance in his eyes. <ref name="Liston" /> It is unconfirmed whether this was something used to close Liston's cuts, or deliberately applied to Liston's gloves;<ref name="Liston" /> however, [[Bert Sugar]] has claimed that "in two of his previous fights, Liston's opponents had complained about their eyes 'burning,'"<ref>{{cite book| author = Sugar, Bert Randolph| title = Bert Sugar on Boxing: The Best of the Sport's Most Notable Writer| url = http://books.google.com/?id=tJ2uBBsN0E0C| date = November 1, 2003| publisher = Globe Pequot| isbn = 978-1-59228-048-3| page = 196 }}</ref> suggesting the possibility that the Liston corner deliberately attempted to cheat.  . 

Liston began the fourth round looking to put away the challenger. As Clay struggled to recover his vision, he sought to escape Liston's offensive. He was able to keep out of range until his sweat and tears rinsed the substance from his eyes, responding with a flurry of combinations near the end of the fifth round. By the sixth, he was looking for a finish and dominated Liston. Then, Liston shocked the boxing world when he failed to answer the bell for the seventh round, stating he had a shoulder injury. At the end of the fight, Clay boasted to the press that doubted him before the match, proclaiming, "I shook up the world!" . 

When Clay beat Liston, he was the youngest boxer (age 22) ever to take the title from a reigning heavyweight champion, a mark that stood until [[Mike Tyson]] won the title (age 20) from [[Trevor Berbick]] on November 22, 1986. At the time, [[Floyd Patterson]] (dethroned by Liston) had been the youngest heavyweight champ ever (age 21), but he won the title during an elimination tournament following Rocky Marciano's retirement by defeating Archie Moore, the light-heavyweight champion at the time.  . 

In the rematch with Liston, which was held in May 1965 in [[Lewiston, Maine]], Ali (who had by then publicly converted to Islam and changed his name) won by knockout in the first round as a result of what came to be called the "phantom punch." Many believe that Liston, possibly as a result of threats from Nation of Islam extremists, or in an attempt to "throw" the fight to pay off debts, waited to be counted out (see Muhammad Ali versus Sonny Liston). Others, however, discount both scenarios and insist that it was a quick, chopping Ali punch to the side of the head that legitimately felled Liston. Ali was declared the winner after 1 minute and 52 seconds. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/16/sports/sports-of-the-times-on-his-50th-ali-is-still-the-greatest.html?src=pm | work=New York Times | title=Sports of The Times; On His 50th, Ali Is Still 'The Greatest' | date=January 16, 1992 | accessdate=January 25, 2012 | first1=Dave | last1=Anderson}}</ref> . 

=== Early title defenses ===. 
On November 22, 1965, Ali fought Floyd Patterson in his second title defense. Patterson lost by TKO at the end of the 12th round. As would later occur with Ernie Terrell, many sportswriters accused Ali of "carrying" Patterson so that he could physically punish him without knocking him out. Ali countered that Patterson, who said his punching prowess was limited when he strained his [[sacroiliac]], was not as easy to down as may have appeared. During the fight Ali called out "What's my name?" to Patterson, a gesture he would later repeat during the Terrell fight.  . 

Ali was scheduled to fight [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] champion [[Ernie Terrell]] (the WBA stripped Ali of his title after his agreement to fight a rematch with Liston) on March 29, 1966, but the llinois Athletic Commission wouldn't approve the Terrell fight unless Ali went to Chicago and apologized for his remarks about the war. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1080216/1/index.htm | work=Sports Illustrated | title=He Could Go To Jail And Still Be Champ | date=August 28, 1967 | accessdate=February 17, 2012 | first1=Angelo, Tex | last1=Dundee, Maule}}</ref> The fight destination continued to change venues and ultimately was delayed. Ali won a 15-round decision against substitute opponent [[George Chuvalo]]. He then went to England and defeated [[Henry Cooper (boxer)|Henry Cooper]] by stoppage on cuts May 21, and knocked out [[Brian London]] in the third round in August. Ali's next defense was against German southpaw [[Karl Mildenberger]], the first German to fight for the title since [[Max Schmeling]]. In one of the tougher fights of his life, Ali stopped his opponent in round 12.  . 

Ali returned to the United States in November 1966 to fight [[Cleveland Williams]] in the [[Houston Astrodome]]. According to the Sports Illustrated account, the bout drew an indoor world record 35,460 fight fans. A year and a half before the fight, Williams had been shot in the stomach at [[point-blank range]] by a Texas policeman. As a result, Williams went into the fight missing one kidney and {{convert|10|ft|m}} of his [[small intestine]], and with a shriveled left leg from nerve damage from the bullet. Ali beat Williams in three rounds. The match has been cited by historians as Ali's greatest performance in the ring, though trainer [[Angelo Dundee]] considered the Liston fight to be Ali's greatest victory, and the Foley fight his best performance. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=3535766 | work=ESPN | title=How would Ali have fared against other heavyweight greats? | date=August 19, 2008 | accessdate=April 1, 2012 | first1=Graham | last1=Houston}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/17/sport/sport-boxing-muhammad-ali/index.html | work=CNN | title=Muhammad Ali: 'The Greatest' at 70 | date=January 8, 2012 | accessdate=March 31, 2012 | first1=Tris | last1=Dixon}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2606152 | work=ESPN | title=Greatest Knockouts: Ali vs. Williams | date=September 28, 2006 | accessdate=February 29, 2012 | first1=Bert | last1=Sugar}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/mobile/boxing/16289663 | work=BBC Sport | title=What they said about Muhammad Ali | date=2012-01-17 | accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/7470417/muhammad-ali-was-continues-greatest | work=ESPN | title=Dundee: Ali was, still is 'The Greatest' | date=2012-01-17 | accessdate=2012-01-17 | first1=Carlos | last1=Irusta}}</ref>  . 

On February 6, 1967, Ali returned to a [[Houston]] [[boxing ring]] to fight Terrell in what is regarded as one of the uglier fights in boxing. Terrell angered Ali by calling him Clay, and the champion vowed to punish him for this insult. During the fight, Ali kept shouting at his opponent, "What's my name, [[Uncle Tom]] ... What's my name?" Terrell suffered 15 rounds of brutal punishment, losing 13 rounds on two judges' scorecards, but Ali did not knock him out. Analysts, including several who spoke to [[ESPN]] on the sports channel's "Ali Rap" special, speculated that the fight continued only because Ali wanted to thoroughly punish and humiliate Terrell. After the fight, [[Tex Maule]] wrote, "It was a wonderful demonstration of boxing skill and a barbarous display of cruelty." When asked about this during a replay of the fight on ABC's popular "Wide World of Sports" by host Howard Cosell, Ali said he was not unduly cruel to Terrell- boxers are paid to punch their opponents into submission or defeat. He pointed out that if he had not hit and hurt Terrell, Terrell would have hit and hurt him, which is standard practice. Cosell's repeated reference to the topic surprised Ali. Following his final defense against [[Zora Folley]] in March 1967, Ali was stripped of his title the following month for refusing to be drafted into the Army<ref name="greatath"/> and had his professional boxing license suspended.  . 

=== Conversion to the Nation of Islam ===. 
[[File:Elijah Muhammad and Cassius Clay NYWTS.jpg|thumb|left|Ali at an address by [[Elijah Muhammad]]]]
After winning the championship from Liston in 1964, Clay revealed that he was a member of the [[Nation of Islam]] (often called the Black Muslims at the time) and the Nation gave Clay the name Cassius X, discarding his surname as a symbol of his ancestors' enslavement, as had been done by other Nation members. On Friday, March 6, 1964, [[Malcolm X]] took Clay on a [[tour guide|guided tour]] of the UN building (for a second time). Malcolm X announced that Clay would be granted his "X." That same night, [[Elijah Muhammad]] recorded a statement over the phone to be played over the radio that Clay would be renamed [[Muhammad]] (one who is worthy of praise) [[Ali (name)|Ali]] (fourth [[Rashidun|rightly guided caliph]]). Only a few journalists (most notably [[Howard Cosell]]) accepted it at that time. Venerable boxing announcer [[Don Dunphy]] addressed the champion by his adopted name, as did British reporters. The adoption of this name symbolized his new identity as a member of the [[Nation of Islam]].  . 

Many sportswriters of the early 1960s reported{{Where|date=July 2011}} that it was Ali's brother, [[Rahman Ali|Rudy Clay]], who converted to Islam first (estimating the date as 1961). Others wrote{{Where|date=July 2011}} that Clay had been seen at Muslim rallies a few years before he fought Liston. Ali's own version{{Where|date=July 2011}} is that he would sneak into Nation of Islam meetings through the back door roughly three years before he fought Sonny Liston.  . 

Aligning himself with the Nation of Islam made him a lightning rod for controversy, turning the outspoken but popular champion into one of that era's most recognizable and controversial figures. Appearing at rallies with [[Nation of Islam]] leader [[Elijah Muhammad]] and declaring his allegiance to him at a time when mainstream America viewed them with suspicion—if not outright hostility—made Ali a target of outrage, as well as suspicion. Ali seemed at times to provoke such reactions, with viewpoints that wavered from support for [[civil rights]] to outright support of [[separatism]]. For example, Ali once stated, in relation to integration: "We who follow the teachings of Elijah Muhammad don't want to be forced to integrate. Integration is wrong. We don't want to live with the white man; that's all."<ref name="livingflame">{{cite news|accessdate=May 20, 2008|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1072751,00.html|title=The living flame|work=The Observer |location=UK |date=November 2, 2003|author=Hauser, Thomas }}</ref> And in relation to inter-racial marriage: "No intelligent black man or black woman in his or her right black mind wants white boys and white girls coming to their homes to marry their black sons and daughters."<ref name="livingflame" /> Indeed, Ali's [[religion|religious beliefs]] at the time included the notion that the white man was "the devil" and that white people were not "righteous." Ali claimed that white people hated [[black people]].  . 

Ali converted from the [[Nation of Islam]] sect to mainstream [[Sunni Islam]] in 1975. In a 2004 autobiography, written with daughter [[Hana Yasmeen Ali]], Muhammad Ali attributes his conversion to the shift toward Sunni Islam made by [[Warith Deen Muhammad]] after he gained control of the [[Nation of Islam]] upon the death of [[Elijah Muhammad]] in 1975.

In 1964, Ali failed the [[Military of the United States|U.S. Armed Forces]] qualifying test because his writing and spelling skills were sub-par. However, in early 1966, the tests were revised and Ali was reclassified as [[Class 1-A|1A]]. <ref name="greatath"/> This classification meant he was now eligible for the draft and induction into the U.S. Army during a time when the United States was involved in the [[Vietnam War]]. When notified of this status, he declared that he would refuse to serve in the [[United States Army]] and publicly considered himself a [[conscientious objector]]. <ref name="greatath"/> Ali stated that "War is against the teachings of the [[Qur'an|Holy Qur'an]]. I'm not trying to dodge the draft. We are not supposed to take part in no wars unless declared by [[Allah]] or The Messenger. We don't take part in Christian wars or wars of any unbelievers." He famously said in 1966: "I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong... They never called me [[nigger]]." Rare for a heavyweight boxing champion in those days, Ali spoke at [[Howard University]], where he gave his popular "Black Is Best" speech to 4,000 cheering students and community intellectuals after he was invited to speak by sociology professor, [[Nathan Hare]], on behalf of the Black Power Committee, a student protest group. <ref>{{cite news |title="The Greatest" Is Gone |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,919377-5,00.html |page=5 |work=TIME |date=February 27, 1978 |accessdate=August 4, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=This Week in Black History |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n26_v85/ai_15407999/ |work=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]] |date=May 2, 1994 |accessdate=August 4, 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20090428040723/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n26_v85/ai_15407999/ |archivedate = April 28, 2009|deadurl=yes}}</ref> . 

Appearing shortly thereafter for his scheduled induction into the U.S. Armed Forces on April 28, 1967 in Houston, he refused three times to step forward at the call of his name. An officer warned him he was committing a felony punishable by five years in prison and a fine of $10,000. Once more, Ali refused to budge when his name was called. As a result, he was arrested and on the same day the [[New York State Athletic Commission]] suspended his boxing license and stripped him of his title. Other boxing commissions followed suit. Ali would not be able to obtain a license to box in any state for over three years. <ref>{{cite book | title = More Than a Champion: The Style of Muhammad Ali | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=Hc9tZ7IfUTEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=more+than+a+champion+prime&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NN1gT7LpBYOygwe21-XqBw&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=stronger&f=false | isbn = 978-0-375-70005-7 | first = Jean | last = Reemstsma | authorlink = Jean Phillip Reemstsma | year = 1999 | publisher = Vintage | location = New York | page = | accessdate = March 14, 2012 }}</ref> . 

At the trial on June 20, 1967, after only 21&nbsp;minutes of deliberation, the jury found Ali guilty. <ref name="greatath"/> After a [[Court of Appeals]] upheld the conviction, the case went to the U.S. Supreme Court. During this time, the public began turning against the war and support for Ali began to grow. Ali supported himself by speaking at colleges and universities across the country, where opposition to the war was especially strong. On June 28, 1971, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] reversed his conviction for refusing induction by unanimous decision in ''[[Clay v. United States]]''. <ref name="greatath"/> The decision was not based on, nor did it address, the merits of Clay's/Ali's claims ''per se''; rather, the Government's failure to specify ''which'' claims were rejected and which were sustained, constituted the grounds upon which the Court reversed the conviction. <ref>''[[Clay v. United States]]''</ref> .

=== The Fight of the Century ===. 
{{Main|Fight of the Century}}
In 1970, while his case was still on appeal, Ali was allowed to fight again. On August 12, 1970, with the help of Leroy R. Johnson, a [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] State Senator, he was granted a license to box by the City of Atlanta Athletic Commission. <ref>"Ga. Senator Gets TKOed By His Political 'Friends'", by John H. Britton,''Jet'' March 4, 1971, pp.52–54</ref> In Atlanta on October 26, 1970, he stopped [[Jerry Quarry]] on a cut after three rounds. Shortly after the Quarry fight, the [[New York State Supreme Court]] ruled that Ali had been unjustly denied a boxing license. Once again able to fight in New York, he fought [[Oscar Bonavena]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in December 1970. After a tough 14 rounds, Ali stopped Bonavena in the 15th, paving the way for a title fight against [[Joe Frazier]], who was himself undefeated.  . 

Ali and Frazier met in the ring on March 8, 1971, at [[Madison Square Garden]]. The fight, known as "The [[Fight of the Century]]," was one of the most eagerly anticipated bouts of all time and remains one of the most famous. It featured two skilled, undefeated fighters, both of whom had legitimate claims to the heavyweight crown. [[Frank Sinatra]]—unable to acquire a ringside seat—took photos of the match for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. Legendary boxing announcer [[Don Dunphy]] and actor and boxing aficionado [[Burt Lancaster]] called the action for the broadcast, which reached millions of people. The fight lived up to the hype, and Frazier punctuated his victory by flooring Ali with a hard, leaping left hook in the 15th and final round. Frazier retained the title on a unanimous decision, dealing Ali his first professional loss.  . 

Ali rebounded with six victories in 1972, notching wins over Floyd Patterson and Jerry Quarry. In 1972 Muhammad Ali held the "Muhammad Ali Boxing Show," a series of [[exhibition match]]es between himself and other athletes. In [[San Antonio]], Texas, during the exhibition series, on October 24, 1972, Ali lost against boxer [[Elmo Henderson]]. <ref name="Notheard">Spong, John. "[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-3583462/The-shot-not-heard-round.html The shot not heard round the world: the way Elmo Henderson tells it, his entire life can be boiled down to a single moment in 1972, when he stepped into the ring in San Antonio and knocked out the greatest fighter on the planet. But honestly, that's just where his story begins.]" ([http://www.texasmonthly.com/preview/2004-12-01/feature3 Pay version link]) ''[[Texas Monthly]]''. December 1, 2004. Printed in the December 2004 issue. Retrieved on April 5, 2011. </ref> . 

In 1973, Ali fought [[Ken Norton]], who had broken Ali's jaw and won by split decision over 12 rounds in their first bout in 1972. Ali won the rematch, by split decision, on September 10, 1973, which set up [[Ali-Frazier II]], a nontitle rematch with [[Joe Frazier]], who had already lost his title to George Foreman. The bout was held on January 28, 1974, with Ali winning a unanimous 12-round decision.  . 

=== The Rumble in the Jungle ===. 
{{Main|The Rumble in the Jungle}}
In one of the biggest upsets in boxing history, Ali regained his title on October 30, 1974 by defeating champion [[George Foreman]] in their bout in [[Kinshasa, Zaire|Kinshasa]], [[Zaire]]. Hyped as "[[The Rumble in the Jungle]]", the fight was promoted by [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Don King]].  . 

Almost no one, not even Ali's long-time supporter [[Howard Cosell]], gave the former champion a chance of winning. Analysts pointed out that [[Joe Frazier]] and [[Ken Norton]] had given Ali four tough battles in the ring and won two of them, while Foreman had knocked out both of them in the second round. As a matter of fact, so total was the domination that, in their bout, Foreman had knocked down Frazier an incredible six times in only four minutes and 25&nbsp;seconds.  . 

During the bout, Ali employed an unexpected strategy. Leading up to the fight, he had declared he was going to "dance" and use his speed to keep away from Foreman and outbox him. However, in the first round, Ali headed straight for the champion and began scoring with a right hand lead, clearly surprising Foreman. Ali caught Foreman nine times in the first round with this technique, but failed to knock him out. He then decided to take advantage of the young champion's weakness: staying power. Foreman had won 37 of his 40 bouts by knockout, mostly within three rounds. Eight of his previous bouts did not go past the second round. Ali saw an opportunity to outlast Foreman, and capitalized on it.  . 

In the second round, the challenger retreated to the ropes—inviting Foreman to hit him, while counterpunching and verbally taunting the younger man. Ali's plan was to enrage Foreman and absorb his best blows to exhaust him mentally and physically. While Foreman threw wide shots to Ali's body, Ali countered with stinging straight punches to Foreman's head. Foreman threw hundreds of punches in seven rounds, but with decreasing technique and potency. Ali leaned on the ropes while covering up his body as Foreman threw punches that were deflected and didn't land squarely. The technique was later termed "[[Rope-a-dope|The Rope-A-Dope]]".  . 

By the end of the seventh round, Foreman was exhausted. In the eighth, Ali dropped Foreman with a combination at center ring and Foreman failed to make the count. Against the odds, Ali had regained the title.  . 

The "Rumble in the Jungle" was the subject of a 1996 [[Academy Award]] winning documentary film, ''[[When We Were Kings]]''. The fight and the events leading up to it are extensively depicted in both [[John Herzfeld]]'s 1997 [[docudrama]] ''[[Don King: Only in America]]'' and [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]]'s 2001 docudrama, ''[[Ali (film)|Ali]]''.  . 

=== The Thrilla in Manila ===. 
{{Main|Thrilla in Manila}}
In March 1975, Ali faced [[Chuck Wepner]] in a bout that inspired the original ''[[Rocky]]''. While it was largely thought that Ali would dominate, Wepner surprised everyone by not only knocking Ali down in the ninth round, but nearly going the distance. Ali eventually stopped Wepner in the fading minutes of the 15th round. Following a title defense with [[Ron Lyle]], in July Ali faced [[Joe Bugner]], winning a 15 round decision.  . 

On October 1, 1975, Ali fought [[Joe Frazier]] for the third time. <ref name="greatath"/> Taking place in the Philippines, the bout was promoted as the [[Thrilla in Manila]]<ref name="greatath"/> by [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Don King]], who had ascended to prominence following the Ali-Foreman fight. The anticipation was enormous for this final clash between two great heavyweights. Ali believed Frazier was "over the hill" by that point. Ali's frequent insults, slurs and demeaning poems increased the anticipation and excitement for the fight, but enraged a determined Frazier. Regarding the fight, Ali famously remarked, "It will be a killa... and a chilla... and a thrilla... when I get the gorilla in Manila." . 

The fight lasted 14 grueling rounds in temperatures approaching {{convert|100|°F|°C}}. Ali won many of the early rounds, but Frazier staged a comeback in the middle rounds, while Ali lay on the ropes. By the late rounds, however, Ali regained control and the fight was stopped when Frazier was unable to answer the bell for the 15th and final round (his eyes were swollen shut). Frazier's trainer, Eddie Futch, refused to allow Frazier to continue.  . 

=== Subsequent bouts and retirement ===. 
[[File:Anderson ali.jpg|thumb|Ali being interviewed by [[WBAL-TV]]'s [[Curt Anderson]], 1978, [[Baltimore]], Maryland]]
In February 1976, Ali easily beat [[Jean-Pierre Coopman]]. In April 1976, he defeated [[Jimmy Young (boxer)|Jimmy Young]] and then [[Richard Dunn (boxer)|Richard Dunn]] the following month, which would turn out to be Ali's last knockout victory.  . 

Following that fight, he staged an exhibition match with [[professional wrestler]] and [[Martial arts|martial artist]] [[Antonio Inoki]]. <ref name="sweetScience">{{cite web | last = Tallent | first = Aaron | title=The Joke That Almost Ended Ali's Career|url=http://www.thesweetscience.com/boxing-article/1716/joke-almost-ended-ali-career/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070515075625/http://www.thesweetscience.com/boxing-article/1716/joke-almost-ended-ali-career/|archivedate=May 15, 2007| accessdate=December 4, 2007|publisher=The Sweet Science}}</ref> Although widely perceived as a publicity stunt, [[Muhammad Ali vs. Antonio Inoki|the match against Inoki]] would have a long-term detrimental effect on Ali's mobility.

Ali's legs, however, were bleeding, leading to an infection. He suffered two blood clots in his legs as well. <ref name="sweetScience" /> . 

In September 1976, at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], Ali faced [[Ken Norton]] in their third fight, with Ali winning a close but unanimous 15-round decision. Soon after the fight, Ali temporarily quit boxing to spread the faith of Islam. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newspaperarchive.com/SiteMap/FreePdfPreview.aspx?img=110827611?sec=Sports|title=Champion Ali Quits Boxing|work=The Paris News|page=12|accessdate=October 19, 2011 | date=October 1, 1976}}</ref> . 

In May 1977, Ali defended his title against [[Alfredo Evangelista]]. In September of that year he faced a battering 15 rounds with [[Earnie Shavers]]. Fight doctor [[Ferdie Pacheco]] left Ali's camp following the Shavers fight after being rebuffed for advising Ali to retire.  . 

In February 1978, Ali lost the heavyweight title to 1976 Olympic Light-Heavyweight Champion [[Leon Spinks]]. On September 15, 1978, Ali fought a rematch in the New Orleans [[Louisiana Superdome]] against Spinks for the WBA version of the Heavyweight title, winning it for a record third time. Ali retired following this victory on June 27, 1979, but returned in 1980 to face current champion [[Larry Holmes]] in an attempt to win a heavyweight title an unprecedented four times. Angelo Dundee refused to let his man come out for the 11th round, in what became Ali's only loss by anything other than a decision. The fight has been cited as a contributing factor in Ali's development of Parkinson's Disease. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/arts/television/27muhammad.html?_r=3&scp=2&sq=parkinson%27s%2520disease&st=cse | work=New York Times | title=Boxing King Casts His Shadow, Even at Time of Defeat | date=October 26, 2009 | accessdate=March 5, 2012 | first1=Mike | last1=Hale}}</ref> Ali's final fight, a loss by unanimous decision after 10 rounds, was to up-and-coming challenger [[Trevor Berbick]] in 1981.  . 

=== Ali's legacy ===. 
Muhammad Ali defeated every top heavyweight in his era, which has been called the golden age of heavyweight boxing. Ali was named "Fighter of the Year" by ''[[The Ring (magazine)|Ring Magazine]]'' more times than any other fighter, and was involved in more ''Ring Magazine'' "Fight of the Year" bouts than any other fighter. He is an inductee into the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] and holds wins over seven other Hall of Fame inductees. He is one of only three boxers to be named "[[Sportsman of the Year]]" by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.  . 

In 1978, three years before Ali's permanent retirement, the [[Louisville Board of Aldermen|Board of Aldermen]] in his hometown of [[Louisville, Kentucky]], voted 6–5 to rename Walnut Street to Muhammad Ali Boulevard. This was controversial at the time, as within a week 12 of the 70 [[Traffic sign|street signs]] were stolen. Earlier that year, a committee of the [[Jefferson County Public Schools (Kentucky)|Jefferson County Public Schools]] considered renaming [[Central High School (Louisville, Kentucky)|Central High School]] in his honor, but the motion failed to pass. At any rate, in time, Muhammad Ali Boulevard—and Ali himself—came to be well accepted in his hometown. <ref>{{cite news |first=Bob |last=Hill |title=Ali stirs conflicting emotions in hometown |url=http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051119/ALI01/511190320 |work=[[The Courier-Journal]] |date=November 19, 2005 |accessdate=December 22, 2006 }} {{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref> . 

In 1993, the [[Associated Press]] reported that Ali was tied with [[Babe Ruth]] as the most recognized athlete, out of over 800 dead or alive athletes, in America. The study found that over 97% of Americans over 12 years of age identified both Ali and Ruth. <ref>Retton, Hammill most popular American athletes; Wilstein, Steve, Associated Press; May 17, 1993. </ref> .

According to the Ali Center website, "Since he retired from boxing, Ali has devoted himself to humanitarian endeavors around the globe. He is a devout Muslim, and travels the world over, lending his name and presence to hunger and poverty relief, supporting education efforts of all kinds, promoting adoption and encouraging people to respect and better understand one another. It is estimated that he has helped to provide more than 22 million meals to feed the hungry. Ali travels, on average, more than 200 days per year." .

Ali met his first wife, [[cocktail waitress]] Sonji Roi, approximately one month before they married on August 14, 1964.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Roi's objections to certain Muslim customs in regard to dress for women contributed to the breakup of their marriage.

As a world champion boxer and social activist, Ali has been the subject of numerous books, films and other creative works. In 1963, he released an album of [[spoken word]] on [[Columbia Records]] titled ''I am the Greatest!'' He has appeared on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' on 37 different occasions, second only to [[Michael Jordan]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dtmagazine.com/magazineofweek9282006.html |title=Magazine of the Week (September 28, 2006): Sports Illustrated November 28, 1983 |publisher=Dtmagazine.com |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}</ref>  He appeared in the documentary film ''[[Black Rodeo]]'' (1972) riding both a horse and a bull. His autobiography ''The Greatest: My Own Story'', written with Richard Durham, was published in 1975. <ref name=cp>{{cite book| author = Durham, Richard; Ali, Muhammad| coauthors = Richard Durham| title = The greatest, my own story| url = http://books.google.com/?id=EkfhAAAAMAAJ| date = 1975-10| publisher = Random House| location = New York| isbn = 978-0-394-46268-4| oclc = 1622063 }}</ref> In 1977 the book was adapted into a film called ''[[The Greatest (1977 film)|The Greatest]]'', in which Ali played himself and [[Ernest Borgnine]] played [[Angelo Dundee]]. ''[[When We Were Kings]]'', a 1996 documentary about the Rumble in the Jungle, won an [[Academy Award]],<ref>[[IMDbTitle:0118147|When We Were Kings (1996)]]. </ref> and the 2001 biopic ''[[Ali (film)|Ali]]'' garnered an Oscar nomination for [[Will Smith]]'s portrayal of the lead role. <ref>[[IMDbTitle:0248667|Ali (2001)]]. </ref> . 

For contributions to the entertainment industry, Ali was honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6801 [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. <ref name="HWOFDB">{{cite web|url=http://hwof.com/star/live-theatre/muhammad-ali/2435 |title=Hollywood Walk of Fame database |publisher=HWOF.com}}</ref> . 

==The Muhammad Ali Effect==. 
The Muhammad Ali Effect is a term used in [[psychology]] that was named after him when he stated, "I only said I was the greatest, not the smartest" in his autobiography ''The Greatest: My Own Story''. <ref name=cp /> This term is named after Ali because when people are asked to rate their intelligence and moral behavior in comparison to others, people will rate themselves as more moral, but not more intelligent than others. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Allison|first=S|coauthors=Messick Goethals|title=On being better but not smarter than others: The muhammad ali effect On being better but not smarter than others: The muhammad ali effect|journal=Social Cognition|year=1989|volume=7|issue=3|pages=275–295|accessdate=March 4, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Van Lange|first=P.
