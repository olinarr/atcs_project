The '''Belgian Holocaust denial law''', passed on March 23, 1995, bans public [[Holocaust denial]]. Specifically, the law makes it illegal to publicly "deny, play down, justify or approve of the genocide committed by the German [[Nazism|National Socialist]] regime during the [[Second World War]]". Prosecution is led by the [[Belgum|Belgian]] [[Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism|Centre for Equal Opportunities]]. The offense is punishable by imprisonment of up to one year and fines of up to 2,500 [[Euro|EUR]]. <ref>

==Legislative history==. 
The Holocaust denial bill, drafted by [[Claude Eerdekens]] and [[Yvan Mayeur]] of the [[Socialist Party (francophone Belgium)|Parti Socialiste]], was introduced in the [[Belgian Chamber of Representatives|Chamber of Representatives]] by Eerdekens ([[Socialist Party (francophone Belgium)|PS]]), [[Marcel Cheron]] ([[Ecolo]]), Marcel Colla ([[Socialist Party – Different|SP]]), Yvan Mayeur ([[Socialist Party (francophone Belgium)|PS]]), Luc Dhoore ([[Christian Democratic and Flemish|CVP]]), [[Raymond Langendries]] ([[Humanist Democratic Centre|CDH]]), [[Louis Michel]] ([[Reformist Movement|MR]]) and [[Mieke Vogels]] ([[Groen!|Agalev]]) on June 30, 1992. <ref>[http://www.dekamer.be/kvvcr/showpage.cfm?section=flwb&language=nl&cfm=/site/wwwcfm/flwb/flwbn.cfm?dossierID=0557&legislat=48&inst=K Legislative record of the Holocaust denial bill in Dutch] and [http://www.dekamer.be/kvvcr/showpage.cfm?section=flwb&language=fr&cfm=/site/wwwcfm/flwb/flwbn.cfm?dossierID=0557&legislat=48&inst=K in French], by the Belgian Chamber of Representatives.

The bill passed the [[Belgian Senate|Senate]] on March 14, 1995.  . 

The [[Vlaams Blok]], the predecessor of the [[Vlaams Belang]], voted for the law, "out of a desire for respectability and to break out of its political isolation", even though its leadership "contained Holocaust deniers". <ref>[[World Jewish Congress]] and [[Anti-Defamation League]], ''Anti-semitism worldwide 1999-2000'', Tel Aviv University Press: p66. </ref> . 

[[Monarchy of Belgium|King]] [[Albert II of Belgium|Albert II]] signed and [[Promulgation|promulgated]] the bill on March 23, 1995. The Act was published in the [[Belgian Official Journal]] on March 30, 1995 and entered into force on the same day.  . 

==Freedom of expression==. 
In the past, adversaries of the law have argued that this law restricts the freedom of expression, which is a basic human right. In a decision of 24 June 2003, the [[European Court of Human Rights|European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR)]] stated that "''denying or minimising the Holocaust must be seen as one of the acutest forms of racial slandering and incentives to hatred towards the Jews. The negation or the revision of historical facts of this type call into question the values which found the fight against racism and anti-semitism and is likely to seriously disturb law and order. Attacks against the rights of others of this kind are incompatible with democracy and human rights and their authors incontestably have aims that are prohibited by article 17 of the Convention.''" The court concludes that in application of [[European Convention on Human Rights#Article 17 - prohibition of abuse of rights|article 17 of the ECHR]], the plaintiff can't appeal to the protection of [[European Convention on Human Rights#Article 10 - right to freedom of expression|article 10 ECHR]], insofar that he wants to use the freedom of expression to dispute [[crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]]. <ref>''ECtHR, no. 65831/01, 24 June 2003, R. Garaudy vs. France, unpublished'', cited in {{nl icon}}Dirk Voorhoof, [http://pswserv1.ugent.be/dv/documents/recent_pub/recent_pub_2003/JK.2003.DV.VHO.NEGAT.Final.October.13.doc Antwerpse negationisten van “Vrij Historisch Onderzoek” veroordeeld] ("''Antwerp negationists of "Free Historical Research" convicted''"), Ghent University, October 2003. </ref> . 

==Convictions==. 
On 14 April 2005, the [[Antwerp]] Court of Appeal convicted [[Siegfried Verbeke]] to 1 year imprisonment and a fine of 2,500 EUR, based on this law. The court also suspended his civic rights for a period of 10 years. The [[Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism|Centre for Equal Opportunities]] and the Belgian [[Auschwitz Foundation]] each received symbolic damages of 1 EUR. <ref>{{nl icon}} [http://www.lbr.nl/?node=3374 Veroordeling voor ontkenning van holocaust] ("''Conviction for holocaust denial''"), L.B.R., 4 May 2005, accessed on 4 September 2006. </ref> . 

==Possible expansions==. 
In June 2005, a reform of the law was debated in the [[Belgian Senate]] in order to extend its scope to the negation of other genocides, e.g. the [[Armenian Genocide]] and the [[Rwandan Genocide]]. Due to political and public controversy about the legal qualification of the Armenian genocide, the reform was postponed. <ref>{{fr icon}}

</ref>
Negation of the Armenian genocide has been systematically used as an electoral campaigning tool by Turkish candidates (from all parties) and organisations during Belgian elections since 1999, making it electorally difficult for some parties to take a clear stance on making it illegal. <ref>{{fr icon}}
