'''[[Holocaust denial]]''' is illegal in a number of European countries. <ref name="bazyler">{{cite web|url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/insights/pdf/bazyler.pdf|title=Holocaust Denial Laws and Other Legislation Criminalizing Promotion of Nazism|last=Bazyler|first=Michael J.|date=December 25, 2006|publisher=[[Yad Vashem]]|accessdate=30 March 2012}}</ref> Many countries also have broader laws that criminalize [[genocide denial]].  Also, the Council of Europe's 2003 [[Historical_revisionism_(negationism)#Additional_protocol_to_the_cybercrime convention|Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cyber Crime]], concerning the prosecution of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer systems includes an article entitled ''Denial, gross minimisation, approval or justification of genocide or crimes against humanity'', although this does not have the status of law. Of the countries that ban Holocaust denial, a number ([[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]],  and [[Romania]]) were among the perpetrators of [[the Holocaust]], and many of these also ban other elements associated with Nazism, such as Nazi symbols.  . 

== Overview and commentary ==. 
Scholars have pointed out that countries that specifically ban Holocaust denial generally have legal systems that limit speech in other ways, such as banning [[hate speech]]. According to D. Guttenplan, this is a split between the  "''[[common law]] countries'' of the United States, Ireland and many [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] countries from the ''civil law countries'' of continental Europe and Scotland. In [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries the law is generally more proscriptive. Also, under the civil law regime, the judge acts more as an inquisitor, gathering and presenting evidence as well as interpreting it". <ref>D D Guttenplan, [http://www.indexonline.org/en/news/articles/2005/1/europe-should-freedom-of-speech-stop-at-holo.shtml Should Freedom of Speech Stop at Holocaust Denial?], ''Index of Free Expression, 2005''. </ref> Michael Whine argues that Holocaust denial can inspire violence against Jews; he states, "Jews' experience in the post-World War II era suggests that their rights are best protected in open and tolerant democracies that actively prosecute all forms of racial and religious hatred."<ref>{{citation|author=Whine, Michael|title=Expanding Holocaust Denial and Legislation Against It|publisher=Jewish Political Studies Review|date=Spring 2008|url=http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DRIT=5&DBID=1&LNGID=1&TMID=111&FID=624&PID=0&IID=2202&TTL=Expanding_Holocaust_Denial_and_Legislation_Against_It}}</ref> .

The argument that laws punishing Holocaust denial are incompatible with the [[ECHR|European Convention on Human Rights]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] have been rejected by institutions of the [[Council of Europe]] (the [[European Commission of Human Rights]],<ref>{{cite court|litigants=X. v.

Historians who oppose such laws include [[Raul Hilberg]], [[Richard J. Evans]], and [[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]]. Other prominent opponents of the laws are [[Timothy Garton Ash]],<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1925401,00.html "This is the moment for Europe to dismantle taboos, not erect them"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', October 19, 2006.

Retrieved January 2007. </ref> and [[Noam Chomsky]]. An uproar resulted when [[Serge Thion]] used one of Chomsky's essays without explicit permission as a foreword to a book of Holocaust denial essays (see [[Faurisson affair]]). These laws have also been criticized on the grounds that education is more effective than legislation at combating Holocaust denial and that the laws will make martyrs out of those imprisoned for their violation. <ref>{{citation|url=http://www.thejc.com/comment-and-debate/comment/29844/a-bad-law-against-holocaust-denial|title=A bad law against Holocaust denial|author=Adam Lebor|date=March 25, 2010|publisher=Jewish Chronicle}}</ref> .

==== § 130 Public incitement ====. 
In [[Germany]], ''[[Volksverhetzung]]'' ("incitement of the people") is a concept in [[Strafgesetzbuch|German criminal law]] that bans the incitement of hatred against a segment of the population. It often applies in (although is not limited to) trials relating to Holocaust denial in Germany. In addition, [[Strafgesetzbuch § 86a]] outlaws various symbols of "unconstitutional organisations", such as the [[Swastika]] and the [[Sig (rune)|SS runes]].  .

==  European Union ==. 
The [[European Commission|European Union's executive Commission]] proposed a European Union-wide anti-racism xenophobia law in 2001, which included the criminalization of Holocaust denial. On July 15, 1996, the [[Council of the European Union]] adopted the Joint action/96/443/JHA concerning action to combat racism and xenophobia. <ref>[http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l33058.htm Joint action to combat racism and xenophobia].

The EU extradition policy regarding Holocaust denial was tested in the [[United Kingdom]](UK) during the 2008 failed extradition case brought against the suspected Holocaust denier [[Frederick Toben]]<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/3281083/Suspected-Holocaust-denier-Dr-Gerald-Toben-wins-extradition-fight.html|title=Suspected-Holocaust-denier-Dr-Gerald-Toben-wins-extradition-fight|accessdate=2008:14:04|publisher=telegraph.co.uk | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | date=October 29, 2008}}</ref> by the German government. As there is no specific crime of Holocaust denial in the UK, the German government had applied for Toben's extradition for racial and xenophobic crimes. Toben's extradition was refused by the [[Westminster Magistrates' Court]], and the German government withdrew its appeal to the High Court.  . 

{{Quotation|'''European Union Framework Decision for Combating Racism and Xenophobia (2007)''' 
<p>
The text establishes that the following intentional conduct will be punishable in all EU Member States:

:- '''Publicly condoning, denying or grossly trivialising'''
::- '''crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes as defined in the Statute of the International Criminal Court''' (Articles 6, 7 and 8) directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race, colour, religion, descent or national or ethnic origin, and

::- '''crimes defined by the Tribunal of Nuremberg (Article 6 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal, London Agreement of 1945)''' directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race, colour, religion, descent or national or ethnic origin. 
Member States may choose to punish only conduct which is either carried out in a manner likely to disturb public order or which is threatening, abusive or insulting.

The reference to religion is intended to cover, at least, conduct which is a pretext for directing acts against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin.
