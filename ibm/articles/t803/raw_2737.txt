'''Urban sprawl''', also known as '''suburban sprawl''', is a multifaceted concept, which includes the spreading outwards of a city and its [[suburb]]s to its outskirts to low-density and [[auto-oriented development|auto-dependent development]] on rural land, high segregation of uses (e.g. stores and residential), and various design features that encourage car dependency. <ref name="sprawlcity">[http://www.sprawlcity.org/hbis/wis.html What is Sprawl?]. ''SprawlCity.org''</ref>  . 

Discussions and debates about sprawl are often obfuscated by the ambiguity associated with the phrase.{{Clarify|date=September 2011}} For example, some commentators measure sprawl only with the average number of residential units per acre in a given area. But others associate it with decentralization (spread of population without a well-defined centre), discontinuity (leapfrog development, as defined below), segregation of uses, and so forth.  . 

The term urban sprawl generally has negative connotations due to the health, environmental and cultural issues associated with the phrase. <ref name="cdcreport">Frumkin, Howard (May–June 2002).

[[File:NM 2.JPG|thumb|Suburban sprawl has become common in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]].]]
[[File:Scottsdale cityscape4.jpg|thumb|right|View of suburban development in the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]] ]] . 

Sprawl is characterized by several [[land use]] patterns that usually occur in unison: . 

=== Single-use zoning ===. 
{{Main|Single-use zoning}}
This refers to a situation where commercial, [[residential area|residential]], institutional and [[industrial area]]s are separated from one another. Consequently, large tracts of land are devoted to a single use and are segregated from one another by open space, infrastructure, or other barriers. As a result, the places where people live, work, shop, and recreate are far from one another, usually to the extent that walking, transit use and bicycling are impractical, so all these activities generally require an [[automobile]]. <ref name="cdcreport"/> . 

=== Low-density zoning === . 

Sprawl consumes much more land per-capita than traditional urban developments because zoning laws generally require that new developments are of low density. The exact definition of "low density" is arguable, but a common example is that of [[Single-family home|single family homes]] on large lots, with four or fewer units per net acre. Buildings usually have fewer stories and are spaced farther apart, separated by [[lawn]]s, [[landscaping]], [[road]]s or [[parking lot]]s. Lot sizes are larger, and because more automobiles are used much more land is designated for parking. The impact of low density development in many communities is that developed or "urbanized" land is increasing at a faster rate than the rate of population.  . 

Overall density is often lowered by "leap-frog development". This term refers to the relationship, or lack thereof, between subdivisions. Such developments are typically separated by large [[green belt]]s, i.e. tracts of undeveloped land, resulting in an average density far lower even than the low density described in the previous paragraph. This is a 20th and 21st century phenomenon generated by the current custom of requiring a developer to provide subdivision infrastructure as a condition of development (DeGrove and Turner, 1991). <ref>DeGrove, John and Robyne Turner (1991), "Local Government in Florida: Coping with Massive and Sustained Growth" in Huckshorn, R. (ed.) Government and Politics in Florida. University of Florida Press, Gainesville. </ref> Usually, the developer is required to set aside a certain percentage of the developed land for public use, including roads, parks and schools. In the past, when a [[local government]] built all the streets in a given location, the town could expand without interruption and with a coherent circulation system, because it had [[eminent domain|condemnation power.]] Private developers generally do not have such power (although they can sometimes find local governments willing to help), and often choose to develop on the tracts that happen to be for sale at the time they want to build, rather than pay extra or wait for a more appropriate location.  . 

=== Car-dependent communities === . 

{{Main|Automobile dependency|traffic congestion}}
Areas of urban sprawl are also characterized as highly dependent on [[automobile]]s for [[transportation]], a condition known as [[automobile dependency]]. Most activities, such as shopping and [[commuting]] to work, require the use of a car as a result of both the area's isolation from the city and the isolation the area's residential zones have from its industrial and commercial zones. [[Walking]] and other methods of transit are not practical; therefore, many of these areas have few or no sidewalks. In many suburban communities, stores and activities that are in close proximity "as the crow flies" require automobiles, because the different areas are separated by fences, walls, and drainage ditches. Some critics argue that excessive parking requirements exacerbate car dependency.  . 

=== Job Sprawl and Spatial Mismatch === . 

'''Job Sprawl''' is another land use symptom of urban sprawl and car-dependent communities.  It is defined as low-density, geographically spread-out patterns of employment, where the majority of jobs in a given metropolitan area are located outside of the main city's [[Central Business District]] (CBD), and increasingly in the suburban periphery.  It is often the result of urban disinvestment, the geographic freedom of employment location allowed by predominantly car-dependent commuting patterns of many American suburbs, and many companies' desire to locate in low-density areas that are often more affordable and offer potential for expansion. [[Spatial mismatch]] is related to job sprawl and economic [[Environmental Justice]].  Spatial Mismatch is defined as the situation where poor urban, predominantly minority citizens are left without easy access to entry-level jobs, as a result of increasing job sprawl and limited transportation options to facilitate a reverse commute to the suburbs.  . 

Job sprawl has been documented and measured in various ways.  It has been shown to be a growing trend in America's metropolitan areas.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  The [[Brookings Institution]] has published multiple articles on the topic.  In 2005, author Michael Stoll defined job sprawl simply as jobs located more than {{convert|5|mi|km|adj=on}} radius from the CBD, and measured the concept based on year 2000 [[U.S. Census]] data. <ref>Stoll, Michael A. “Job Sprawl and the Spatial Mismatch between Blacks and Jobs.” Washington D.C.: Brookings Institution, Metropolitan Policy Program.  2005. http://www.brookings.edu/reports/2005/02metropolitanpolicy_stoll.aspx  Accessed 1-22-2010. </ref> Other ways of measuring the concept with more detailed rings around the CBD include a 2001 article by Edward Glaeser<ref>Glaeser, Edward (2001), "Job Sprawl: Employment Location in U.S. Metropolitan Areas." Washington D.C.: Brookings Institution, Metropolitan Policy Program. 2001. http://www.brookings.edu/reports/2001/07_employment_glaeser.aspx  Accessed 1-22-2010</ref> and Elizabeth Kneebone's 2009 article, which show that sprawling urban peripheries are gaining employment while areas closer to the CBD are losing jobs. <ref>Kneebone, Elizabeth. “Job Sprawl Revisited: The Changing Geography of Metropolitan Employment.” Washington D.C.: Brookings Institution. 2009. http://www.brookings.edu/reports/2009/0406_job_sprawl_kneebone.aspx  Accessed 1/22/2010</ref>  These two authors used three geographic rings limited to a {{convert|35|mi|km|adj=on}} radius around the CBD: {{convert|3|mi|km}} or less, 3 to {{convert|10|mi|km}}, and 10 to {{convert|35|mi|km}}.  Kneebone's study showed the following nationwide breakdown for the largest metropolitan areas in 2006: 21.3% of jobs located in the inner ring, 33.6% of jobs in the 3-10 mile ring, and 45.1% in the 10-35 mile ring.  This compares to the year 1998 - 23.3%, 34.2%, and 42.5% in those respective rings.  The study shows CBD employment share shrinking, and job growth focused in the suburban and exurban outer metropolitan rings.  . 

In terms of measurement, spatial mismatch can be thought of as the percentage of people who would have to move in order to be distributed in the same way as jobs. Stoll's research shows that a substantially higher percentage of African Americans (53.5%) experience spatial mismatch than European Americans (35.6%).  On average, more than half of African American citizens would need to move to accomplish similar distribution to jobs.  Latinos (45.8%) experience spatial mismatch as well, though to a lesser extent than African Americans. <ref>Stoll, 2005</ref> . 

== Developments characteristic of sprawl ==. 
=== Housing subdivisions === . 

[[File:Derry and Thompson.JPG|thumb|right|Sprawl outside of [[Toronto]].]]
[[Housing subdivision]]s are large tracts of land consisting entirely of newly-built residences. Prominent [[New Urbanism|New Urbanist]] architectural firm [[Duany Plater-Zyberk & Company]] claim that housing subdivisions “are sometimes called villages, towns, and neighbourhoods by their developers, which is misleading since those terms denote places that are not exclusively residential.”<ref>Duany, Andres, Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk and Jeff Speck. ''Suburban Nation''. New York: Farrar Straus & Giroux, 2001 [http://architecture.about.com/od/communitydesign/a/suburban_2.htm?terms=new+homes+palm+beach+county]</ref>  They are also referred to as developments.  . 

Subdivisions often incorporate curved roads and [[cul-de-sac]]s. Such subdivisions may offer only a few places to enter and exit the development, causing traffic to use high volume collector streets. All trips, no matter how short, must enter the collector road in a suburban system. (Duany Plater-Zyberk 5, 34) . 

=== Strip malls === . 

[[Shopping centre]]s are locations consisting of retail space. In the U.S. and Canada, these vary from [[strip malls]], which refer to collections of buildings sharing a common parking lot, usually built on a high-capacity roadway with commercial functions (i.e., a "strip"). Similar developments in the UK are called Retail Parks. Strip malls/retail parks contain a wide variety of retail and non-retail functions that also cater to daily use (e.g. video rental, takeout food, laundry services, hairdresser). Strip malls consisting mostly of [[big box store]]s or [[category killer]]s are sometimes called "power centers" (U.S.). These developments tend to be low-density; the buildings are single-storey and there is ample space for parking and access for delivery vehicles. This character is reflected in the spacious landscaping of the parking lots and walkways and clear signage of the retail establishments. Some strip malls are undergoing a transformation into [[Lifestyle centre (retail)|Lifestyle centres]]; entailing investments in common areas and facilities (plazas, cafes) and shifting tenancy from daily goods to recreational shopping. European countries such as France, Belgium and Germany have implemented size restrictions for superstores found in strip malls in an effort to limit sprawl (Davies 1995).  . 

=== Shopping malls === . 

Another prominent form of retail development in areas characterized by "sprawl" is the [[shopping mall]]. Unlike the strip mall, this is usually composed of a single building surrounded by a parking lot that contains multiple shops, usually "anchored" by one or more [[department store]]s (Gruen and Smith 1960). The function and size is also distinct from the strip mall. The focus is almost exclusively on recreational shopping rather than daily goods. Shopping malls also tend to serve a wider (regional) public and require higher-order infrastructure such as highway access and can have floorspaces in excess of a million square feet (ca. 100,000 m²). Shopping malls are often detrimental to downtown shopping centres of nearby cities since the shopping malls act as a surrogate for the [[Central business district|city centre]] (Crawford 1992). Some downtowns have responded to this challenge by building shopping centres of their own (Frieden and Sagelyn 1989; consider also [[Toronto Eaton Centre]] (1977), [[Ottawa]]'s [[Rideau Centre]], Boston's [[Shops at Prudential Center]], and Providence's [[Providence Place]]).  . 

In the 1970s, the Ontario government created the Ontario Downtown Renewal Programme, which helped finance the building of several downtown malls across Ontario (such as the aforementioned Eaton Centre). The program was created to reverse the tide of small business leaving downtowns for larger sites surrounding the city.  . 

=== Fast food chains === . 

[[Fast food]] chains are often built early in areas with low property values where the population is expected to boom and where large traffic is predicted, and set a precedent for future development. [[Eric Schlosser]], in his book ''[[Fast Food Nation]]'', argues that fast food chains accelerate suburban sprawl and help set its tone with their expansive parking lots, flashy signs, and plastic architecture (65). [[Duany Plater Zyberk & Company]] believe that this reinforces a destructive pattern of growth in an endless quest to move away from the sprawl that only results in creating more of it (Duany Plater-Zyberk 26).  . 

== Examples ==. 
According to the National Resources Inventory (NRI), about 8,900 square kilometres (2.2 million acres) of land in the United States was developed between 1992 and 2002. Presently, the NRI classifies approximately 100,000 more square kilometres (40,000 square miles) (an area approximately the size of [[Kentucky]]) as developed than [[United States Census Bureau|the Census Bureau]] classifies as urban. The difference in the NRI classification is that it includes rural development, which by definition cannot be considered to be "urban" sprawl. Currently, according to the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 Census]], approximately 2.6 percent of the U.S. land area is urban. <ref>Lubowski, Ruben N.; Marlow Vesterby, Shawn Bucholtz, Alba Baez, and Michael J. Roberts (2006-05-31). [http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/EIB14/ Major Uses of Land in the United States, 2002]. ''[[Economic Research Service]]'', . Retrieved on 2008-02-07. </ref> Approximately 0.8 percent of the nation's land is in the 37 urbanized areas with more than 1,000,000 population. In 2002, these 37 urbanized areas supported around 40% of the total American population. <ref>[http://www.demographia.com/db-ua2000pop.htm USA Urbanized Areas: 2000 Ranked by Population]. ''Demographia'', 2002-08-25. Retrieved on 2008-02-08. </ref> . 

[[File:Chicagoland air.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Chicago]] metro area, nicknamed "[[Chicagoland]]".]]
Nonetheless, some [[urban area]]s have expanded geographically even while losing population. But it was not just urbanized areas in the U.S. that lost population and sprawled substantially. According to data in "Cities and Automobile Dependence" by Kenworthy and Laube (1999), urbanized area population losses occurred while there was an expansion of sprawl between 1970 and 1990 in [[Brussels, Belgium]]; [[Copenhagen, Denmark]]; [[Frankfurt]], [[Hamburg]], and [[Munich]], [[Germany]]; and [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]], albeit without the wholesale dismantling of public transit systems that occurred in the United States.  . 

[[File:Melbourne2.jpg|thumb|left|The urban sprawl of [[Melbourne]].]]
At the same time, the urban cores of these and nearly all other major cities in the [[United States]], [[Western Europe]], and [[Japan]] that did not annex new territory experienced the related phenomena of falling household size and, particularly in the U.S., "[[white flight]]", sustaining population losses. <ref>[http://www.demographia.com/db-worldcore400.htm High-Income World Central City Population Losses]. ''Demographia''. Retrieved on 2008-02-08. </ref> This trend has slowed somewhat in recent years, as more people have regained an interest in urban living.  . 

[[Los Angeles]] was one of the world's first low density urbanized areas, resulting from its large geographic metropolitan area. Today, the area's near universal car ownership makes it a prominent example of sprawl.  However, Los Angeles has become more dense over the past half-century, principally due to small lot zoning and a high demand for housing due to population growth. The city of Los Angeles has increased its density rate up to approximately 7,000 people per square mile in the year 2000, however that is still substantially less than [[New York City]]'s 27,000 average, [[San Francisco]]'s 17,000 average, and [[Chicago]]'s 12,000 average.  . 

Urban sprawl is not limited to developed countries, and may be more prevalent in developing countries. For example, there is considerable land consumed by urban sprawl in [[Mexico City]], in [[Beijing]], in [[Antananarivo]] (the capital of [[Madagascar]]), in [[Johannesburg]], and in eastern parts of [[South Africa]].  . 

== Smart growth and the Compact City==. 
{{Main|Smart growth}} {{Main|Compact City}} . 

The term 'smart growth' has been particularly used in North America.  The terms 'compact city' or 'urban intensification' are often used to describe similar concepts, in Europe and particularly the UK where it has influenced Government policy and planning practice in recent years.  . 

The first [[urban growth boundary]] in the U.S. was in [[Fayette County, Kentucky]] in 1958. <ref>Kolakowski, K., P. L. Machemer, J. Thomas, and R. Hamlin. 2000. Urban growth boundaries: a policy brief for the Michigan Legislature. Urban and Regional Planning Program, Department of Geography, Michigan State University, Lansing, Michigan, USA. Available online at: http://www.ippsr.msu.edu/Publications/ARUrbanGrowthBound.pdf</ref> Fifteen years later, the state of [[Oregon]] enacted a law in 1973 limiting the area urban areas could occupy, through urban growth boundaries. As a result, [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], the state's largest urban area, has become a leader in [[smart growth]] policies that seek to make urban areas more compact (they are called urban consolidation policies). After the creation of this boundary, the population density of the [[urbanized area]] increased somewhat (from 1,135 in 1970<ref>[http://www.demographia.com/dm-uad.htm USA Urbanized Areas 1950-1990]</ref> to 1,290 per km² in 2000<ref>[http://www.demographia.com/db-ua2000pop.htm USA Urbanized Areas 2000]</ref>). While the growth boundary has not been tight enough to vastly increase density, the consensus is that the growth boundaries have protected great amounts of wild areas and [[farmland preservation|farmland]] around the metro area.  . 

Many parts of the San Francisco Bay Area have also adopted urban growth boundaries; 25 of its cities and 5 of its counties have urban growth boundaries. Many of these were adopted with the support and advocacy of [[Greenbelt Alliance]], a non-profit land conservation and urban planning organization.  . 

In other areas, the design principles of [[District Regionalism]] and [[New Urbanism]] have been employed to combat urban sprawl.  . 

== Transit-, bicycling- and pedestrian-oriented developments ==. 
{{See also|traffic calming}}
These three developments are compatible.  . 

=== Transit-oriented development ===. 
{{Main|Transit-oriented development}} . 

While cities such as [[Los Angeles]] are well known for sprawling suburbs, policies and public opinion are changing. Transit-oriented development, in which higher-density mixed-use areas are permitted or encouraged near transit stops is encouraging more compact development in certain areas-particularly those with light and heavy rail transit systems.  . 

=== Bicycling-oriented development (BOD) ===. 
Bicycles are the preferred means of travel in many countries{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}. Also, bicycles are permitted in [[public transit]]. Businesses in areas of some towns where bicycle use is high are thriving. Bicycles and transit are contributing in two important ways toward the success of businesses:<ref>http://columbus-ite.com/2008/04/07/bicycle-oriented-development/</ref>
* First, is that on average the people living the closest to these business districts have more money to spend locally because they don’t spend as much on their cars. 
* Second, because these people rely more on bicycling, walking and transit than on driving, they tend to focus more of their commerce on locally-owned neighborhood businesses that are convenient for them to reach.  . 

=== Pedestrian-oriented development===. 
[[Walkability]] is a measure of how friendly an area is to [[walking]].  Walkability has many health, environmental, and economic benefits.  However, evaluating walkability is challenging because it requires the consideration of many [[Subjectivity|subjective]] factors. <ref>[http://www.atypon-link.com/TELF/doi/abs/10.1680/ensu.2008.161.2.105 S. Reid, "Fit for purpose: evaluating walkability", ''Engineering Sustainability'', Vol. 161, No. 2, June 2008, pp.105-112.]</ref>  Factors influencing walkability include the presence or absence and quality of [[footpath]]s, [[sidewalk]]s or other pedestrian right-of-ways, traffic and road conditions, land use patterns, building accessibility, and safety, among others. <ref name="TDM encyclopedia">[http://www.vtpi.org/tdm/tdm92.htm Online TDM Encyclopedia chapter on pedestrian improvements]</ref>  Walkability is an important concept in [[sustainable]] [[urban design]]. <ref>[http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=ENV&recid=8642022&q=walkability+sustainability&uid=1015422&setcookie=yes S.

=== Criticisms ===. 
Arguments opposing urban sprawl run the gamut from the more concrete effects such as health and environmental issues to more abstract consequences involving neighborhood vitality.  . 

==== Health and environmental impact ====. 
Urban sprawl is associated with a number of negative environmental and [[public health]] outcomes, with the primary result being increased dependence on automobiles.  . 

==== Increased pollution and reliance on fossil fuel ====. 
In the years following World War II, when vehicle ownership was becoming widespread, [[public health]] officials recommended the health benefits of suburbs due to soot and industrial fumes in the city center. However, air in modern suburbs is not necessarily cleaner than air in urban neighborhoods. <ref name="DeRidder">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2008.06.044 |author=Koen De Ridder, Filip Lefebre, Stefan Adriaensen, Ute Arnold, Wolfgang Beckroege, Christine Bronner, Ole Damsgaard, Ivo Dostal, Jiri Dufek, Jacky Hirsch, Luc Int Panis, Zdenek Kotek, Thierry Ramadier, Annette Thierry, Stijn Vermoote, Annett Wania, Christiane Weber |title=Simulating the impact of urban sprawl on air quality and population exposure in the German Ruhr area.

On average, suburban residents generate more per capita pollution and [[carbon emissions]] than their urban counterparts because of their increased driving. <ref name="cdcreport" /><ref>{{cite journal|last=Fuller|first=R.|coauthors=Crawford|journal=Impact of past and future residential housing development patterns on energy demand and related emissions, Journal of Housing and the Built Environment|year=2011|volume=26|issue=2|pages=165–83}}</ref> . 

==== Increase in traffic and traffic-related fatalities ====. 
A heavy reliance on automobiles increases traffic throughout the city as well as automobile crashes, pedestrian injuries, and air pollution. Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of five and twenty-four and is the leading accident-related cause for all age groups. <ref>[http://www.disastercenter.com/cdc/ U.S. Death Statistics].

====Delays in emergency medical services response times====. 
Research covered in the ''Journal of Economic Issues'' and ''State and Local Government Review'' shows a link between sprawl and emergency medical services response delays. <ref>”[http://www.cues.fau.edu/cnu/docs/Ex-Urban_Sprawl_as_a_Factor_in_Traffic_Fatalities_and_EMS_Response_Times_in_the_SE_US-Lambert-Meyer.pdf Ex-Urban Sprawl as a Factor in Traffic Fatalities and EMS Response Times in the Southeastern United States,”] Thomas E. Lambert and Peter B. Meyer.  ''Journal of Economic Issues'', Vol. 40, No. 4, December 2006, pages 941-953</ref><ref>{{cite jstor|25469783}}</ref> . 

==== Increased obesity ====. 
The American Journal of Public Health and the American Journal of Health Promotion, have both stated that there is a significant connection between sprawl, obesity, and [[hypertension]]. <ref name="obesity">McKee, Bradford. "[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9C06EED61338F937A3575AC0A9659C8B63 As Suburbs Grow, So Do Waistlines]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[The New York Times Company]], 2003-09-04. Retrieved on 2008-02-07. </ref> Many urbanists argue that this is due to less walking in sprawl-type developments. Living in a car centered culture forces inhabitants to drive everywhere, thus walking far less than their urban (and generally healthier) counterparts. <ref name="sprawlobesity">[http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/report/HealthSprawl8.03.pdf Measuring the Health Effects of Sprawl, A National Analysis of Physical Activity, Obesity and Chronic Disease 2003]</ref> . 

==== Decrease in social capital ====. 
Urban sprawl may be partly responsible for the decline in [[social capital]] in the United States. Compact neighborhoods can foster casual social interactions among neighbors, while sprawl creates barriers. Sprawl tends to replace public spaces with private spaces such as fenced-in backyards. <ref name="csc06" /> . 

==== Decrease in land and water quantity and quality ====. 
{{See also|Urban runoff}}
Due to the larger area consumed by sprawling suburbs compared to urban neighborhoods, more farmland and wildlife habitats are displaced per resident. As forest cover is cleared and covered with [[impervious surfaces]] ([[concrete]] and [[asphalt]]) in the suburbs, rainfall is less effectively absorbed into the ground water [[aquifer]]s. <ref name="cdcreport" /> This threatens both the quality and quantity of water supplies. Sprawl increases [[water pollution]] as rain water picks up [[gasoline]], [[motor oil]], [[heavy metals]], and other pollutants in [[surface runoff|runoff]] from parking lots and roads. Sprawl fragments the land, which increases the risk of [[invasive species]] spreading into the remaining forest.  . 

==== Increased infrastructure costs ====. 
Living in larger, more spread out spaces generally makes public services more expensive. Since [[Automobile|car]] usage becomes endemic and [[public transport]] often becomes significantly more expensive, city planners are forced to build large [[highway]] and [[parking]] [[infrastructure]], which in turn decreases taxable land and revenue, and decreases the desirability of the area adjacent to such structures. Providing services such as [[water supply|water]], [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s, and [[electricity]] is also more expensive per household in less dense areas. <ref>http://www.smartcommunities.ncat.org/articles/sprawl.pdf</ref> . 

==== Increased personal transportation costs ====.

==== Neighborhood quality ====. 
Critics of sprawl maintain that sprawl erodes quality of life. Duany and Plater-Zyberk believe that in traditional neighborhoods the nearness of the workplace to retail and restaurant space that provides cafes and [[convenience store]]s with daytime customers is an essential component to the successful balance of urban life. Furthermore, they state that the closeness of the workplace to homes also gives people the option of walking or riding a bicycle to work or school and that without this kind of interaction between the different components of life the urban pattern quickly falls apart. (Duany Plater-Zyberk 6, 28). [[James Howard Kunstler]] has argued that poor [[aesthetics]] in suburban environments make them "places not worth caring about", and that they lack a sense of history and identity.  . 

==== White flight ====. 
{{Main|White flight}}
Some blame suburbs for what they see as a homogeneity of society and culture, leading to sprawling suburban developments of people with similar race, background and [[socioeconomic status]]. <ref>Ray, Brian.

==== Groups that oppose sprawl ====. 
The [[American Institute of Architects]] and the [[American Planning Association]] recommend against sprawl and instead endorses [[Smart growth|smart]], [[mixed-use development]], including buildings in close proximity to one another that cut down on automobile use, save energy, and promote walkable, healthy, well-designed neighborhoods. <ref>[http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/smartgrowth05.pdf Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities].

=== Responses === . 

[[United States|American]] [[public policy]] analyst [[Randal O'Toole]] of the [[Cato Institute]], a [[Libertarian movement in the United States|libertarian]] [[think tank]], has argued that sprawl, thanks to the automobile, gave rise to affordable suburban neighborhoods for middle class and lower class individuals, including non-whites. He notes that efforts to combat sprawl often result in subsidizing development in wealthier and whiter neighborhoods while condemning and demolishing poorer minority neighborhoods. <ref name="Randal O'Toole Gridlock">Randal O'Toole "Gridlock"</ref> . 

==== Consumer preference for sprawl ====. 
Peter Gordon, a professor of planning and economics at the University of Southern California's School of Urban Planning and Development, argues that many households in the United States, Canada, and Australia, especially middle and [[upper class]] families, have shown a preference for the suburban lifestyle. <ref name="reason" /> Reasons cited include a preference towards lower-density development (for lower ambient noise and increased privacy), better schools, less crime, and a generally slower lifestyle than the urban one. <ref name="reason" /> Those in favor of the current pro low-density land use policies also argue that this sort of living situation is an issue of personal choice and economic means. <ref name="reason" /> One suburban [[Detroit]] politician defends low-density development as the preferred lifestyle choice of his constituents, calling it "...the American Dream unfolding before your eyes."<ref>http://www.oakgov.com/exec/brooks/sprawl.html</ref> . 

====Urban sprawl and automobile dependency==== . 

Whether urban sprawl does increase problems of [[automobile dependency]] and whether conversely, policies of [[smart growth]] can reduce them have been fiercely contested issues over several decades.  An influential study in 1989 by [[Peter Newman]] and Jeff Kenworthy compared 32 cities across North America, Australia, Europe and Asia. <ref>[[:File:Petrol use urban density.svg|Cities and Automobile Dependence: An International Sourcebook, Newman P and Kenworthy J, Gower, Aldershot, 1989.]]</ref>  The study has been criticised for its methodology <ref>MINDALI, O., RAVEH, A. and SALOMON, I., 2004. Urban density and energy consumption: a new look at old statistics. Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 38(2), pp. 143-162. </ref> but the main finding that denser cities, particularly in Asia, have lower car use than sprawling cities, particularly in North America, has been largely accepted although the relationship is clearer at the extremes across continents than it is within countries where conditions are more similar.  . 

Within cities, studies from across many countries (mainly in the developed world) have shown that denser urban areas with greater mixture of land use and better public transport tend to have lower car use than less dense suburban and ex-urban residential areas.  This usually holds true even after controlling for socio-economic factors such as differences in household composition and income. <ref>e.g. FRANK, L. and PIVOT, G., 1994. Impact of Mixed Use and Density on Three Modes of Travel. Transportation Research Record, 1446, pp. 44-52. </ref>  This does not necessarily imply that suburban sprawl causes high car use, however.  One confounding factor, which has been the subject of many studies, is residential self-selection<ref>[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~db=all~content=g910669635 Transport Reviews Volume 29 Issue 3 (2009)] was entirely devoted to this issue</ref>: people who prefer to drive tend to move towards low density suburbs, whereas people who prefer to walk, cycle or use transit tend to move towards higher density urban areas, better served by public transport.  Some studies have found that, when self-selection is controlled for, the built environment has no significant effect on travel behaviour. <ref>e.g. Bagley, M.N. and Mokhtarian, P.L. (2002) The impact of residential neighborhood type on travel behavior: A structural equations modeling approach. Annals of Regional Science36 (2), 279. </ref>  More recent studies using more sophisticated methodologies have generally refuted these findings: density, land use and public transport accessibility can influence travel behaviour, although social and economic factors, particularly household income, usually exert a stronger influence. <ref>e.g.Handy, S., Cao, X. and Mokhtarian, P.L. (2005) Correlation or causality between the built environment and travel behavior? Evidence from Northern California. Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment10 (6), 427-444. </ref> . 

====The Paradox of Intensification==== . 

Reviewing the evidence on urban intensification, [[smart growth]] and their effects on travel behaviour Melia et al. (2011)<ref>[http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/10555/2/melia-barton-parkhurst_The_Paradox_of_Intensification.pdf Melia, S., Barton, H. and Parkhurst, G. (In Press) The Paradox of Intensification. Transport Policy 18 (1)]</ref> found support for the arguments of both supporters and opponents of [[smart growth]] measures to counteract urban sprawl.  Planning policies that increase population densities in urban areas do tend to reduce car use, but the effect is a weak one, so doubling the population density of a particular area will not halve the frequency or distance of car use.  . 

These findings led them to propose the paradox of intensification, which states: . 

''<div style="padding-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em">[[Ceteris paribus]], urban intensification which increases population density will reduce per capita car use, with benefits to the global environment, but will also increase concentrations of motor traffic, worsening the local environment in those locations where it occurs. </div>'' . 

==== Debate over traffic and commute times ====. 
Those not opposed to low density development argue that traffic intensities tend to be less, traffic speeds faster and, as a result, ambient [[air pollution]] is lower. (See [http://www.demographia.com/dbx-intlair.htm demographia's] report.) [[Kansas City, Missouri]] is often cited as an example of ideal low-density development, with congestion below the mean and [[Real estate pricing|home prices]] below comparable Midwestern cities. [[Wendell Cox]] and [[Randal O'Toole]] are the leading figures supporting lower density development.  . 

Longitudinal (time-lapse) studies of commute times in major metropolitan areas in the United States have shown that commute times decreased for the period 1969 to 1995 even though the geographic size of the city increased. <ref>[http://www.publicpurpose.com/ut-6995commute.htm US Commuting Travel Times Down Over Quarter Century]. PublicPurpose.com. Retrieved on 2008-02-08. </ref> . 

==== Risk of increased housing prices ====. 
There is also some concern that Portland-style anti-sprawl policies will increase housing prices. Some research suggests Oregon has had the largest housing affordability loss in the nation,<ref>[http://www.demographia.com/db-usafford1970.htm Housing Affordability Trends: USA States]. ''Demographia''. Retrieved on 2008-02-08. </ref> but other research shows that Portland's price increases are comparable to other Western cities. <ref>Lewyn, Michael (2005-10-04). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=816885 Sprawl, Growth Boundaries and the Rehnquist Court]. ''Social Science Research Network''. Retrieved on 2008-02-08. </ref>  . 

In Australia, it is claimed by some that housing affordability has hit "crisis levels" due to "urban consolidation" policies implemented by state governments. <ref>"[http://www.unisa.edu.au/news/2005/241005.asp Seeking solutions to the housing affordability crisis]", ''[[University of South Australia]]'', 2005-10-24. Retrieved on 2008-02-08. </ref> In Sydney, the ratio of the price of a house relative to income is 9:1. <ref>Saunders, Peter (2005). "[http://www.cis.org.au/Policy/autumn05/polaut05-1.htm After the House Price Boom: Is this the end of the Australian dream?]", ''Policy''. Retrieved on 2008-02-08. </ref> The issue has at times been debated between the major political parties. <ref>Archer, Lincoln. "[http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,22704050-5012863,00.html?from=public_rss Kevin Rudd says John Howard is ignoring housing]", ''[[News Limited]]'', 2007-11-05. Retrieved on 2008-02-08. </ref> . 

==== Freedom ====. 
There are some sociologists such as Durkheim who suggest there is a link between population density and the number of rules that must be imposed. The theory goes that as people are moved closer together geographically their actions are more likely to noticeably impact others around them. This potential impact requires the creation of additional social or legal rules to prevent conflict. A simple example would be as houses become closer together the acceptable maximum volume of music decreases, as it becomes intrusive to other residents. <ref>Unnever, James D.  [http://www.radford.edu/~junnever/law/onDurkheim.htm On Durkheim]. Retrieved on 2008-02-08. </ref> . 

==== Crowding and increased aggression ====. 
Numerous studies link increased population density with increased aggression. Some people believe that increased population density encourages crime and anti-social behavior.  It is argued that human beings, while social animals, need significant amounts of social space or they become agitated and aggressive. <ref>{{cite book|author=Sennett, Richard (ed.)|title=Classic Essays on the Culture of Cities|year=1969|month=June|location=New York|pages=67–83|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts}}</ref>
However, the relationship between higher densities and increased social pathology has been largely discredited <ref>Fischer, Claude S., Mark Baldasarre, and R. J. Ofshe. 1975. "Crowding Studies and Urban Life - A Critical Review." Journal of the American Institute of Planners 41(6): 406-418. </ref> .
