A '''council house''', otherwise known as a local authority house, is a form of [[public housing|public or social housing]].  The term is used primarily in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]]. Council houses were built and operated by local [[Municipality|councils]] to supply uncrowded, well-built homes on secure tenancies at reasonable rents to primarily [[working class]] people. Council house development began in the late 19th century and peaked in the mid-20th century, at which time council housing included many large suburban "council estates" and numerous urban developments featuring [[tower blocks]]. Many of these developments did not live up to the hopes of their supporters, and now suffer from [[urban blight]].  . 

Since 1979 the role of council housing has been reduced by the introduction of [[right to buy]] legislation, and a change of emphasis to the development of new social housing by [[housing association]]s. Nonetheless a substantial part of the UK population still lives in council housing. Approximately 40% of the country’s social housing stock is owned by local authorities, 15% is managed by arm's length management organisations, and 45% by [[housing association]]s. <ref>{{citation|last=Cowan|first=David|year=2009|title=Trust, Distrust and Betrayal|journal=[[Modern Law Review|MLR]]|volume=72|issue=2|pages=157–181|issn=|doi=}}</ref>  In Scotland, council estates are known as ''schemes''.  . 

==Origins==. 
===Almshouses===. 
[[Image:Dorset sherbone almshouses.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Almshouse]] at [[Sherborne]], [[Dorset]]]]
The documented history of social housing in Britain starts with [[almshouse]]s which were established from the 10th century, to provide a place of residence for "poor, old and distressed folk". The first recorded almshouse was founded in [[York]] by [[King Athelstan]], and the oldest still in existence is the [[Hospital of St Cross|Hospital of St. Cross]] in [[Winchester]], dating to circa 1133.  . 

===Philanthropists===. 
[[Image:Councilhousing02.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Council houses in [[Chatteris, Cambridgeshire]]]]
The pressure for decent housing was increased by overcrowding in the large cities during the [[Industrial Revolution]] of the 19th century; many social commentators (such as [[Octavia Hill]]) reported on the squalor, sickness and immorality that arose. Some [[philanthropist]]s had begun to provide housing in [[Apartment building|tenement blocks]], while some factory owners built entire villages for their workers, such as [[Saltaire]] (1853), [[Bournville]] (1879), [[Port Sunlight]] (1888), [[Stewartby]], and [[Silver End]] as late as 1925.  . 

===Tax funding===. 
It was not until 1885, when a [[Royal Commission]] was held, that the state took an interest. This led to the ''[[Housing of the Working Classes Act 1890]]'', which encouraged local authorities to improve the housing in their areas. As a consequence the [[London County Council]] opened the [[Boundary Estate]] in 1900, and many localmen councils began building [[Apartment|flats]] and houses in the early 20th century. The [[World War I|First World War]] indirectly provided a new impetus, when the poor physical health and condition of many urban recruits to the [[British Army|army]] was noted with alarm. This led to a campaign known as ''Homes fit for heroes'' and in 1919 the Government first required councils to provide housing, helping them to do so through the provision of subsidies, under the ''[[Housing Act 1919]]''. The government was no doubt encouraged by the increasing influence of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the widespread [[labor strike|strikes]] and [[mutiny|mutinies]] which characterized Britain in 1919.  . 

Many houses were built over the next few years in ''cottage estates''. Examples of these were built at the [[Downham Estate]] in [[London]],<ref>[http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/case-studies/downham-estate/2]</ref>[[Kates Hill]] in [[Dudley]],<ref>[http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/News/How-1920146s-Dudley-honoured-Nurse-Cavell-2.htm]</ref>, [[Low Hill]] in [[Wolverhampton]],<ref>[http://www.geograph.org.uk/article/A-History-of-Council-Housing-in-Wolverhampton/3]</ref>, [[Weoley Castle]] in [[Birmingham]]<ref>[http://www.brumagem.co.uk/ae_Weoley-area_Birmingham.htm]</ref>and [[Norris Green]] in [[Liverpool]]. <ref>[http://www.catalystmedia.org.uk/issues/nerve3/norris_green.htm]</ref> . 

Blocks of flats were also built. <ref>[[Chris Roberts (author)|Chris Roberts]], Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme, Thorndike Press,2006 (ISBN 0-7862-8517-6)</ref> . 

While new council housing had been built, little had been done to resolve the problem of inner city [[slum]]s. This was to change with the ''[[Housing Act 1930]]'', which required councils to prepare [[slum clearance]] plans, and some progress was made before the [[Second World War]] intervened.  .

During the Second World War almost four million British homes were [[The Blitz|destroyed or damaged]], and afterwards there was a major boom in council house construction. <ref>[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761553483_27/United_Kingdom.html "United Kingdom" Section VII (History), J (World War II and Its Aftermath), J2 (Postwar Britain)], ''[[MSN Encarta]] Online Encyclopedia'', 2006. [http://www.webcitation.org/5kwayvfWq Archived] 2009-10-31. </ref><!-- this ref only applies to the four million houses, not to the major boom. Still looking for that.-->  The bomb damage of the Second World War only worsened the condition of Britain's housing stock, which was in poor condition prior to the outbreak of war.  Prior to the war many social housing projects, such as the [[Quarry Hill, Leeds|Quarry Hill Flats]] (pictured) were built.  However the bomb damage meant that much greater progress had to be made with slum clearance projects.  In cities like [[London]], [[Coventry]] and [[Kingston upon Hull]], which received particularly heavy bombing, the redevelopment schemes were often larger and more radical.  . 

In the immediate post-war years, and well into the 1950s, council house provision was shaped by the [[New Towns Act 1946]] and the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1947]] of the 1945–51 [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government. At the same time this government introduced housing legislation that removed [[explicit]] references to housing for the [[working class]] and introduced the concept of 'general needs' construction (i.e., that council housing should aim to fill needs for a wide range of society). In particular, [[Aneurin Bevan]], the [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister for Health and Housing]], promoted a vision of new estates where "the working man, the [[physician|doctor]] and the [[clergyman]] will live in close proximity to each other".  . 

While a number of large cities tentatively erected their first [[high rise]] developments (e.g. Aston Cross in [[Birmingham]], [[Churchill Gardens]] in [[Westminster]]), in [[England]] and [[Wales]] homes were typically [[semi-detached]] or in small [[Terraced house|terraces]]. A three-bedroom semi-detached council house was typically built on a square grid 7 yards ({{convert|21|ft|m}}) on the side, with a maximum density of no more than 12 houses per acre (30 houses per hectare; around 337 m² per house), meaning that most houses had generous space around them. The [[new town]]s and many existing towns had countless estates built to this basic model. In [[Scotland]], the tradition of tenement living meant that most homes of this period were built in low rise (3–4) storey blocks of [[flats]].  . 

For many [[working class]] people, this housing model provided their first experience of private  indoor [[toilet]]s, private [[bathroom]]s and hot running water. For [[tenants]] in England and Wales it also usually provided the first experience of private [[garden]] space (usually front and rear). The quality of these houses, and in particular the existence of small gardens in England and Wales, compared very favourably with social housing being built on the European continent in this period.  . 

Towards the end of the 1950s the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government began to re-direct the building programme back from 'general needs' towards [[inner city]] [[slum]] clearance. 
At the same time the rising influence of [[modernism|modernist]] architecture, the development of new construction techniques, such as [[system building]] (a form of [[prefabrication]]), and a growing desire by many towns and cities to retain [[population]] (and thus prestige) within their own boundaries (rather than "export" people to [[New Towns]] and "out of boundary" [[peripheral]] estates) led to this model being abandoned in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s inner city areas. 
Instead, [[tower block]]s became the preferred model. The argument was advanced that more generously sized dwellings could be provided this way, that communities could be re-housed close to existing [[employment]] opportunities and there would be far less disruption to local [[shopping]] and [[leisure]] patterns. During the Fifties and Sixties, the number of high-rise dwellings rose significantly. In 1953, just 23% of public sector approvals were for flats, with only 3% high-rise (defined as blocks of six stories or more). By 1966, however, high-rise housing accounted for 26% of all homes started. <ref>The Five Giants: A Biography of the Welfare State by Nicholas Timmins</ref> . 

Subsequent research at the [[London School of Economics|LSE]] has tried to cast doubt on claims that only [[high rise]] developments could accommodate the [[density level of population]] required for these policies. <ref>R. Burdett, T. Travers, D. Czischke, P. Rode and B. Moser, Density and Urban Neighbourhoods in London: Summary Report(Enterprise LSE Cities, 2004), pp. 13-14. </ref> However, it should perhaps be noted{{says who|date=November 2010}} that low-rise estates built to these densities (e.g. [[Lillington Gardens]] in [[Pimlico]]) have frequently been criticised as claustrophobic by residents and the [[Privacy|private]] spaces provided amount to little more than enclosed yards; in the case of Lillington Gardens it has consistently received lower resident satisfaction ratings than the nearby 20-storey Hide Tower, and has also seen far fewer purchases under the [[Right to buy scheme]] than Hide Tower. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} . 

The use of [[system building]] methods was later seen as possibly being a short-sighted, false economy, as many of the later houses are in a poor state of repair or have been demolished. On many estates, older council houses, with their largely superior build quality, have outlived them.  . 

However, central government (under both the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] parties) considered the provision of as much new housing as possible to be a major part of post-war policy, and provided subsidies for local authorities to build such housing. A number of types of system building proved to have serious flaws, and some flats - which were initially very popular with tenants due to their generous space standards, and with [[councillor]]s and housing officials due to their speed of construction<ref>GLENDENNING, Miles and MUTHESIUS, Stefan (1994) Tower Block: Modern Public Housing in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland</ref> - have suffered problems, especially poor protection from damp and weather ingress, as well as other design defects and poor management.  . 

On 16 May 1968, the problems associated with tower blocks were brought into sharp focus after the partial collapse of [[Ronan Point]], a system-built tower block in [[London Borough of Newham|Newham]], east [[London]], as a consequence of a gas explosion. A similar incident caused significant damage to one side of a block in [[Manchester]].  . 

Although these incidents were due to a series of failures (not least being the illegal connection of gas cookers by unqualified friends of tenants), subsequently all system-built tower blocks were usually built with 'all electric' heating, to prevent the occurrence of such an explosion.  . 

While some [[tower block]]s have been demolished, many that occupy convenient city centre sites (such as [[The Sentinels]] in [[Birmingham]], [[Trellick Tower]] and Great Arthur House on the [[Golden Lane Estate]] in London) remain extremely popular with residents and have even been subject to an element of [[gentrification]], caused by the onward sale of [[leases]] purchased by original tenants under the [[Right to buy scheme]] to more affluent purchasers.  . 

[[Image:BWFE panorama from northwest.JPG|thumb|centre|600px|]][[Broadwater Farm]] in [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]], north London. One of the most ambitious post-war council housing developments, the complex of [[Housing estate|estates]] became a national symbol of perceived failures in the council housing system following the [[Broadwater Farm riot]] in 1985. Since 1985 Broadwater Farm has been the focus of an intense regeneration program, although the area still experiences a high crime rate.  .

[[Becontree]] in Dagenham is the largest area of council housing in the UK with a population of over 100,000. Building started in the 1920s and took eleven years to finish. There is only a small part of Dagenham that is not Becontree, and some do not consider Becontree to be an estate but really just the bulk of a town. Otherwise, the largest estates are [[Wythenshawe]] in the south of Manchester and [[Bransholme]] in the north-east of Hull. Arron Way in [[Corby]] was a large estate, although the majority of the housing became derelict and the area is now undergoing regeneration. Other large estates across [[London]] include Ashburton estate in [[Putney]], [[Alton Estate]] in [[Roehampton]], [[Churchill Gardens]] in [[Pimlico]], [[Aylesbury Estate]] in [[Walworth]], a vast series of estates in [[Gospel Oak]] (especially around [[Queen's Crescent Market]]) including the Bacton, Wendling, Lamble Street, Southfleet, Denton, Kiln Place, North Kentish Town and the Ludham and Waxham estates, plus the [[Ferrier Estate]], and  the Thamesmead Estate in South-East [[London]].  . 

There are also numerous large council estates in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]]. These include [[Castle Vale]] in [[Birmingham]], [[Newtown, Birmingham|Newtown]] in [[Birmingham]], [[Low Hill]] in [[Wolverhampton]], [[Hateley Heath]] in [[West Bromwich]], [[Blakenall Heath]] in [[Walsall]], [[Priory Estate]] in [[Dudley]], [[Tanhouse]] in [[Halesowen]], [[Camp Hill]] in [[Nuneaton]] and [[Chapel Street Estate]] in [[Brierley Hill]].  . 

In [[Scotland]], Glasgow has the highest proportion of social housing. The largest estates include [[Drumchapel]], [[Easterhouse]], [[Castlemilk]] and [[Pollok]]. In Edinburgh there are several estates on the outskirts of the city, including those at [[Craigmillar]], [[Wester Hailes]] and [[Sighthill]].  . 

Council estates in [[Greater Manchester]] included the [[Hattersley]] overspill housing estate.  . 

[[Wales]] also has many large council estates. These include [[Caia Park]] in [[Wrexham]], [[Bettws, Newport|Bettws]] in [[Newport]] and [[Ely, Cardiff|Ely]] in [[Cardiff]].  . 

There were also many large council estates in [[Yorkshire]]. There are some pit villages, such as [[Grimethorpe]], which are almost entirely composed of original council housing.  Estates in [[Leeds]], [[West Yorkshire]] include [[Cross Gates]] [[Lincoln Green]], [[Gipton]], [[Seacroft]] and [[Halton Moor]].  [[Bransholme]] in North East [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] is the largest in Yorkshire. [[Sheffield]] boasts the award winning [[Park Hill, Sheffield|Park Hill]] (now being redeveloped).  . 

In [[Tyneside]] large council estates include [[Byker]] and [[Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne|Walker]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Felling, Tyne and Wear|Felling]] in [[Gateshead]] and [[Meadow Well]] in [[North Tyneside]], the site of violent civil disorder during the early 1990s. A large urban regeneration scheme is also being planned for [[Scotswood]] in the West End of Newcastle after decades of urban decay and high crime levels.  . 

The [[Red Road (flats)|Red Road flats]] in [[Glasgow]] were once the tallest residential buildings in [[Europe]], but are now earmarked for demolition in local council regeneration plans.  [[Cottingley Towers]] and Cottingley Heights in [[Cottingley, Leeds|Cottingley]], [[Leeds]] are also particularly notable in their considerable height.  . 

[[New town]]s built across Britain in the 20 or so years following the end of the [[Second World War]] were predominantly made up of council housing, but many of these have since been further developed to see private housing become the most frequent accommodation. Many [[commuter towns]] around [[London]] have large areas of Council Housing.  . 

An early and famous development of council flats was at [[Quarry Hill, Leeds|Quarry Hill]] in Leeds. Modelled on Karl Marx Hof flats in Vienna.the complex was built by Leeds City Council. <ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/leeds/content/image_galleries/image_gallery_quarry_hill_gallery.shtml?9 BBC - Leeds - In Pictures - Quarry Hill's history<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>   At the time they were considered revolutionary: each flat had a motorized rubbish chute leading to a central incinerator. The complex had its own offices, shops and [[gas works]]. The 1970s sitcom [[Queenie's Castle]] was filmed there. Long-term problems with the steel-frame structure lead to demolition, beginning in 1978 and there is now no evidence of their existence.  The [[Department for Work and Pensions|DWP]] and [[Department of Health|DH]] now have their regional headquarters on the site, alongside the [[West Yorkshire Playhouse]].  . 

==Design==. 
[[Image:Ferry Lane Estate.JPG|thumb|right|200px|1970s council housing in [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]], North London]]
[[Image:Tomcollinshouse 1.jpg|thumb|Tom Collins House, Byker Wall Estate|right|Tom Collins House, [[Byker Wall]] Estate, [[Newcastle Upon Tyne]]]]
Council housing was generally typified by houses with generously sized rooms (compared to the bottom end of the private sector), particularly those built in the 1970s after the [[Parker Morris Committee|Parker Morris]] standards were introduced. However they also tended to be unimaginatively designed, and rigid council rules often forbade tenants "personalising" their houses. Council tenants also faced problems of mobility, finding it hard to move from one property to another as their families grew or shrank, or to seek work. Despite the building, there was a constant demand for housing, and 'waiting lists' are maintained with preference being given to those in greatest need.  In [[Birmingham]] people accepted as eligible for council housing are allocated points according to need, people then bid for properties and the property goes to the bidder with the highest number of points who wants it.  People who fail to get a property can carry on bidding until they are successful.  This is like a market but bidding success depends on need rather than financial resources.  . 

The original council houses from the early 1920s were among the first houses in the country to feature electricity, running water, bathrooms, indoor toilets and front/rear gardens. Many of these houses had a "cottage" design and were built on estates imitating [[Garden city movement|garden city]] principles, with an open spaced layout that gave a pleasant environment to residents who had previously lived in dilapidated inner city slums. These new houses had two, three, four or five bedrooms, and generous-size back gardens intended for vegetable-growing.  . 

Flats and bungalows were first built by local councils during the interwar years, but in relatively low volumes. It was not until the 1950s that this type of property became a common sight. It was also around this time that councils started building garages on new housing developments, although these were usually in separate blocks to houses.  . 

The first tower block flats in Britain were built during the early 1950s, reaching a peak in the 1960s. But these flats quickly became unpopular due to poor insulation and structural defects, with construction of high-rise flats being effectively ended during the 1970s. The first few tower blocks were demolished during the later part of the 1980s, but clearance programmes accelerated during the 1990s and are still ongoing in the 2000s. The most notable regeneration programme featuring tower blocks was that of the [[Castle Vale]] estate in [[Birmingham]]. 32 of the estate's 34 tower blocks were cleared between 1995 and 2003, with the remaining two being refurbished and re-opened as "vertical warden-controlled schemes". All of the estate's 27 maisonette blocks were also cleared, as were more than 100 bungalows. The remaining low-rise stock, however, was retained. A similar regeneration had taken place around the end of the 1980s and start of the 1990s on [[Smethwick|Smethwick's]] [[Galton Village]] estate, known locally as the '''Concrete Jungle'''.  . 

Many of the older interwar council houses have been demolished, mostly due to subsidence or decay. Much of this regeneration has been concentrated in the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] since the early 1990s. Areas that have been regenerated include [[Pype Hayes]] and [[Stockfield Estate|Stockfield]] in [[Birmingham]], parts of [[The Lunt]] estate in [[Bilston]], the Poet's Estate at [[Harden, West Midlands|Harden]] in [[Walsall]] and the '''Harrowby Road Estate''' in [[Darlaston]]. Several other estates are currently earmarked for a similar regeneration in the future. These include the [[Goscote, West Midlands|Goscote Estate]] in [[Walsall]], parts of the [[Priory Estate]] in [[Dudley]] and parts of the [[Tibbington]] Estate in [[Tipton]].  . 

==Criticisms==. 
[[Image:Seacroft2.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Rundown streets in [[Seacroft]], [[Leeds]]]] . 

Social policy economists, such as Culyer and Barr, have been critical of the role that council housing plays in attempts to help the poor.  One large criticism is that it hurts labour mobility with its system of allocating housing to those in the local area.  Working-class people thus face a disincentive for moving across district lines, when they would be farther down the waiting list for council housing in the new districts.  When Britain witnessed mass immigration after the Second World War, new immigrants did not initially qualify for council houses and this led to racial segregation in housing.  This has changed over time; most large cities have council estates with large Asian and Black communities.  The division remains most marked in Northern mill towns, which have large Asian communities that remain concentrated outside the council estates.  . 

Another criticism is that the system favours those who have already secured tenancy, even after they are no longer in dire need.  The combination of security of tenure and affordable rent gives little incentive to tenants to downsize from family accommodation after their children have moved out.  Meanwhile, those who are on the waiting list are often in much greater need of this welfare, yet they cannot have it; once a council house has been granted to a tenant, they cannot be evicted except for anti-social behaviour, serious offences committed at the premises<ref>{{citation|last=Mack|first=Jon|year=2009|title=Possession following criminal conviction: Ground 14|journal=Landlord & Tenant Review|volume=13|issue=6|pages=209–211}}</ref> or serious breach of the tenancy conditions, such as rent arrears.  . 

==Decline==. 
{{Original research|section|date=September 2007}}
[[Image:Ackworth.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Ackworth Court, [[Hockwell Ring]], [[Luton]] ]]
Council housing declined sharply in the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] era, as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government encouraged aspiration toward home ownership<ref>[http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=102413 Margaret Thatcher Party Election Broadcast (Housing)] ''1974 Sep 27''</ref> under the [[Right to buy scheme]].  . 

Laws restricted councils' investment in housing, preventing them subsidising it from local taxes, but more importantly, council tenants were given the "right to buy" in the 1980s Housing Act offering a discount price on their council house. The [[Right to Buy Scheme]] allowed tenants to buy their home with a discount of up to 60% of the market price for houses and 70% for flats, depending on the time they had lived there. Councils were prevented from reinvesting the proceeds of these sales in new housing, and the total available stock, particularly of more desirable homes, declined.  . 

The "right-to-buy" was popular with many former [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] voters and, although the Labour government of [[Tony Blair]] tightened the rules (reducing the maximum discount in areas of most housing need), it did not end the right-to-buy. Labour did relax the policy forbidding reinvestment of sales proceeds{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}.  . 

Some councils have now transferred their housing stock to not-for-profit housing associations, who are now also the providers of most new public sector housing. Elsewhere, [[referendum]]s on changing ownership, in Birmingham for example, have been won by opponents of government policy.  . 

The current position is that council housing is a more and more residualised and stigmatised sector, with the term 'council' increasingly used as a pejorative. Whereas in its early years, council housing was an acceptable option for much of the population, it is now increasingly an option only for those reliant on [[social security]].  . 

In some parts of the country, especially northern Britain, some council housing is virtually unlettable. Council housing stock has sometimes been used to house those seeking [[refugee]] status ('asylum seekers'), who have no choice in their accommodation. In the south and in London in particular, demand still massively outstrips supply.  . 

The [[City of Wakefield|Wakefield]] district council found itself unable to maintain its supply of council housing and transferred it all to a housing association, in 2004; this represented the second largest stock transfer in British history.  Housing rented from the council accounted for about 28% of the district and around 40% of the actual city of Wakefield.  . 

Other than Wakefield, districts that maintain large amounts of council housing include most [[inner London]] boroughs with [[Southwark]], [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]], [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] and [[Lambeth]] having the highest proportions/amounts. Also, [[Barnsley]], [[Corby]], [[Easington (district)|Easington]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Leeds]], [[Manchester]], [[Nottingham]], [[Sheffield]] and [[Birmingham]].  Many districts of the country have less than 10% of housing rented from the council; the national average stands at 14%. - more statistics are available as of the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]]<ref>http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=6579&More=Y</ref> although some have transferred to housing associations since then.  . 

Council estates have often been stereotyped as a source of high crime rates, though similar problems can occur in areas of private housing.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} . 

As mentioned earlier, many council housing estates have already undergone partial or total redevelopment, while more schemes are in the pipeline.  . 

These include [[North Peckham]] in [[London]], [[Castle Vale]] in [[Birmingham]], [[Stockbridge Village]] in [[Liverpool]], [[Blakenhall|Blakenhall Gardens]] in [[Wolverhampton]], [[Harden, West Midlands|Harden]] in [[Walsall]], [[Galton Village]] in [[Smethwick]], [[Camp Hill]] in [[Nuneaton]] and [[Hateley Heath]] in [[West Bromwich]].  . 

==Law==. 
[[Image:De beauvoir estate 1.jpg|thumb|De Beauvoir Estate, [[De Beauvoir Town]], east London ]]
The legal status and management of council houses, and the social housing sector, has been subject to lobbying and change in recent years.  [[Local Authorities]] now have new legal powers to enable them to deal with anti-social behaviour and the misuse of council houses by organised gangs or anti-social tenants. An example is when a gang uses social housing as a "[[crack house]]". <ref>{{citation|last=Mack|first=Jon|year=2009|title=Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003: Part 1A closure order|journal=[[Justice of the Peace Magazine|CL&J]]|volume=173|issue=|pages=116–117}}</ref>  [[Anti-social behaviour order|Anti-social Behaviour Orders]] (ASBOs) were created by the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]], and [[Anti-social_Behaviour_Act_2003#Antisocial_Behaviour_Injunctions_.28ASBIs.29|ASBIs]] were created by amendments to the Housing Act 1996, enacted by the [[Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003]].  Tony Blair launched the [[Respect Agenda]] in 2005,<ref>[http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page7459.asp Blair's Speech outlining 'Respect' agenda] (2005-05-06)</ref> aimed at instilling core values in the tenants of council houses.  Recently bodies such as the Social Housing Law Association<ref>http://www.shla.org.uk</ref> have been formed to discuss the impact of legislation in the social housing sector and to provide training and lobbying facilities for those who work in that area.  .
