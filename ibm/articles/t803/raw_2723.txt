A '''tower block''', '''high-rise''', '''apartment tower''', '''office tower''', '''apartment block''', or '''block of flats''', is a tall [[building]] or structure used as a [[apartment building|residential]] and/or [[office building]]. In some areas they may be referred to as "MDU" standing for "Multi Dwelling Unit". <ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EDSW8ZXByAcC&pg=PA13&dq=multi+dwelling+unit&hl=en&ei=VZvzS6q-NcOh_AaDyeDyDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=multi%20dwelling%20unit&f=false BICSI] McGraw-Hill Professional, 2002, ISBN 0-07-138211-9</ref> . 

High-rise buildings became possible with the invention of the [[elevator]] (lift) and cheaper, more abundant building materials. 
The materials used for the [[structural system]] of high-rise buildings are [[reinforced concrete]] and [[steel]]. Most North American style [[skyscraper]]s have a [[steel frame]], while residential blocks are usually constructed out of concrete.  There is no clear definition of any difference between a tower block and a skyscraper though a building lower than about thirty storeys is not likely to be a skyscraper and a building with fifty or more storeys is certainly a skyscraper. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/547956/skyscraper |title=skyscraper (building) |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2011-11-25}}</ref> . 

High-rise structures pose particular design challenges for [[Structural engineering|structural]] and [[Geotechnical engineering|geotechnical]] engineers, particularly if situated in a seismically active region or if the underlying soils have geotechnical risk factors such as high compressibility or [[bay mud]].  They also pose serious challenges to firefighters during emergencies in high-rise structures.  New and old building design, building systems like the building [[Standpipe (firefighting)|standpipe]] system, [[HVAC]] systems (Heating, Ventilation and Air conditioning), [[fire sprinkler]] system and other things like stairwell and [[elevator]] evacuations pose significant problems.  . 

Apartment blocks have technical and economic advantages in areas with high population density. They have become a distinguished form of housing accommodation in virtually all densely populated [[urban area]]s around the world. In contrast with low-rise and single-family houses, apartment blocks accommodate more inhabitants per unit of area of land they occupy and also decrease the cost of [[municipal infrastructure]].  . 

==History==. 
[[Image:Shibam Yemen Interior.jpg|thumb|These tower blocks were built in [[Shibam]], [[Yemen]] in the 16th century, and are the tallest [[mudbrick]] buildings in the world]] . 

High-rise apartment buildings had already appeared in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]]: the [[insulae]] in [[ancient Rome]] and several other cities in the [[Roman Empire]], some of which might have reached up to 10 or more storeys,<ref>Gregory S. Aldrete: "Daily Life in the Roman City: Rome, Pompeii and Ostia", 2004, ISBN 978-0-313-33174-9, p.79f. </ref> one reportedly having 200 stairs. <ref>[[Martial]], Epigrams, 27</ref> Because of the destruction caused by poorly-built high-rise insulae collapsing,<ref>Gregory S. Aldrete (2004), ''Daily Life in the Roman City: Rome, Pompeii and Ostia'', p. 78, ISBN 978-0-313-33174-9</ref> several [[Roman emperor]]s, beginning with [[Augustus]] (r. 30 BC - 14 AD), set limits of 20–25 metres for multi-storey buildings, but met with limited success,<ref>[[Strabo]], 5.3.7</ref><ref>Alexander G. McKay: Römische Häuser, Villen und Paläste, [[Feldmeilen]] 1984, ISBN 3-7611-0585-1 p. 231</ref> as these limits were often ignored despite the likelihood of taller insulae collapsing. <ref>Gregory S. Aldrete (2004), ''Daily Life in the Roman City: Rome, Pompeii and Ostia'', pp. 78-9, ISBN 978-0-313-33174-9</ref>  The lower floors were typically occupied by either shops or wealthy families, while the upper storeys were rented out to the lower classes. <ref>Gregory S. Aldrete: "Daily Life in the Roman City: Rome, Pompeii and Ostia", 2004, ISBN 978-0-313-33174-9, p. 79 ff. </ref>  Surviving [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]] indicate that seven-storey buildings even existed in [[Roman province|provincial]] towns, such as in 3rd century AD [[Hermopolis]] in [[History of Roman Egypt|Roman Egypt]]. <ref name="PapyrusOxyrhynchus">Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 2719, in: Katja Lembke, Cäcilia Fluck, Günter Vittmann: ''Ägyptens späte Blüte.

In [[History of Arab Egypt|Arab Egypt]], the initial capital city was [[Fustat]]. It housed many high-rise residential buildings, some seven storeys tall that could reportedly accommodate hundreds of people. [[Al-Muqaddasi]] in the 10th century described them as resembling [[minaret]]s, while [[Nasir Khusraw]] in the early 11th century described some of them rising up to 14 storeys, with [[roof garden]]s on the top storey complete with ox-drawn [[water wheel]]s for irrigating them. <ref name="Behrens-Abouseif 1992 6">{{citation|title=Islamic Architecture in Cairo|first=Doris|last=Behrens-Abouseif|year=1992|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|isbn=90-04-09626-4|page=6}}</ref><ref name="Joan D.

The skyline of many important [[Middle Ages|medieval]] cities was dominated by large numbers of high-rising urban towers which fulfilled defensive, but also representative purposes. The residential [[Towers of Bologna]] numbered between 80 to 100 at a time, the largest of which still rise to 97.2 m. In [[Florence]], a law of 1251 decreed that all urban buildings should be reduced to a height of less than 26 m, the regulation immediately put into effect. <ref name="Werner Müller 345">Werner Müller: "dtv-Atlas Baukunst I.

Tower blocks were built in the [[Yemen]]i city of [[Shibam]] in the 16th century. The houses of Shibam are all made out of [[Mudbrick|mud bricks]], but about 500 of them are [[tower house]]s, which rise 5 to 16 storeys high,<ref name="Helfritz">{{citation|title=Land without shade|first=Hans|last=Helfritz|journal=Journal of the Royal Central Asian Society|volume=24|issue=2|date=April 1937|pages=201–16|doi=10.1080/03068373708730789}}</ref> with each floor having one or two [[apartment]]s. <ref name=Jerome>{{citation|title=The Architecture of Mud: Construction and Repair Technology in the Hadhramaut Region of Yemen|last=Pamela Jerome, Giacomo Chiari|first=Caterina Borelli|journal=APT Bulletin|volume=30|issue=2–3|year=1999|pages=39–48 [44]|doi=10.2307/1504639|jstor=1504639|author2=Chiari, Giacomo|author3=Borelli, Caterina}}</ref><ref name=UNESCO>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/192 Old Walled City of Shibam], [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Centre</ref> This technique of building was implemented in order to protect residents from Bedouin attacks.

==Modern development==. 
=== United Kingdom ===. 
[[Image:Crossways Estate.jpg|thumb|The three tower blocks of the Crossways Estate in [[Bow, London]], United Kingdom]] . 

Tower blocks were built in the [[UK]] after the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The first residential tower block, "[[Harlow New Town|The Lawn]]" was constructed in [[Harlow]], Essex in 1951; it is now a Grade II [[listed building]]. In many cases Tower Blocks were seen as a "quick-fix" to cure problems caused by crumbling and unsanitary 19th century dwellings or to replace buildings destroyed by German aerial bombing. Initially, they were welcomed, and their excellent views made them popular living places. Later, as the buildings themselves deteriorated, they grew a reputation for being undesirable low cost housing, and many tower blocks saw rising crime levels, increasing their unpopularity. One response to this was the great increase in the number of [[housing estate]]s built, which in turn brings its own problems. In the UK, tower blocks particularly lost popularity after the partial collapse of [[Ronan Point]] in 1968. [[Glasgow]], the largest city in Scotland, is believed to contain the highest concentration of tower blocks in the UK - examples include the [[Hutchesontown C]] blocks in the [[Gorbals]], the 20-storey blocks in [[Sighthill, Glasgow|Sighthill]], and the 31-storey [[Red Road (flats)]] in the city's north east.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} However, on the whole, London has the largest number of high-rise residential buildings in the UK.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} . 

;The post-war British tower block vision . 

Post-war [[United Kingdom|Britain]] was the stage for a tower block building ‘boom’; from the 1950s to the late 1970s there was a dramatic increase in tower block construction. During this time, local authorities desired to impress their voters by building futuristic and imposing tower blocks, which would signify post-war progress. <ref>Hanley, L. (2007) ''Estates: an intimate history'', London, Granta Books, p. 104. </ref> Both [[Patrick Dunleavy]] and Lynsey Hanley agree that architects and planners were influenced by [[Le Corbusier]]’s promotion of high-rise architecture. <ref>[[Patrick Dunleavy|Dunleavy, P.]] (1981) ''The politics of mass housing in Britain, 1945-1975'', Oxford, U.K, Clarendon Press</ref><ref name="Hanley, L. 2007"/> The modern tower blocks were to include features that would foster desired forms of resident interaction, an example being the inclusion of [[Le Corbusier]]’s [[streets in the sky]] in some estates. <ref>Dunleavy, P. (1981) ''The politics of mass housing in Britain, 1945-1975'', Oxford, U.K, Clarendon Press, p. 57. </ref> . 

As well as inspiring residents, local authority planners believed that the way tower blocks were constructed would save money. <ref>Dunleavy, P. (1981) ''The politics of mass housing in Britain, 1945-1975'', Oxford, U.K, Clarendon Press, p. 84. </ref> Generally, the tower blocks were built on cheap [[greenfield land]] skirting established cities. <ref name="Power, A. 1997 p. 57">Power, A. (1997) ''Estates on the edge'', Great Britain, MacMillan, p. 57. </ref> Although the property prices for these periphery sites were markedly cheaper than their inner city counterparts, they often had little access to public amenities, such as [[public transport]]. <ref name="Hanley, L. 2007">Hanley, L. (2007) ''Estates: an intimate history'', London, Granta Books. </ref> It was thought that the implementation of industrialised building techniques would lower costs too, as similar tower blocks would be replicated over many sites. <ref name="Power, A. 1997 p. 57"/>  Uniform and standardised parts, such as toilet fittings and door handles, would be fitted throughout many tower blocks – planners deemed that buying in bulk would reduce overall costs. <ref name="Power, A. 1997 p. 57"/> . 

Another key aspect of the tower block vision was the '[[Brutalist]]' architectural method, popular with architects and planners at the time. The Brutalist emphasis led to the construction of stark and striking tower blocks with large sections of exposed concrete. <ref>Dunleavy, P. (1981) ''The politics of mass housing in Britain, 1945-1975'', Oxford, U.K, Clarendon Press, p. 58</ref> Concrete was to be an integral part of the tower block designs; it could be poured on site, offering boundless flexibility to the building designers. <ref name=Power59>Power, A. (1997) ''Estates on the edge'', Great Britain, MacMillan, p. 59. </ref>  To the planners, concrete was a silver bullet for the construction process – it was economical, and 'was vaunted as being long-lasting, if not indestructible'. <ref>Power, A. (1997) ''Estates on the edge, Great Britain'', MacMillan, p. 58. </ref> . 

;The post war British tower block reality
[[File:Elmet Towers, Swarcliffe.jpg|thumb|right|Elmet Towers in [[Swarcliffe]], [[Leeds]], showing the dereliction that led to its demolition.]]
Coleman's 1985 work argues that in trying to emulate [[Le Corbusier]]'s ideas, the tower block planners only succeeded in encouraging social problems. <ref>Lund, B. (1996) ''Housing problems and housing policy'', New York, Longman, p. 127. </ref>
Although architects and local authorities intended the opposite, tower blocks quickly became, as Hanley sharply stated, 'slums in the sky'. <ref name="Hanley, L. 2007"/> Due to demanding deadlines, complicated construction practices were rushed and many tower blocks experienced structural decay as a result – roofs leaked, concrete suffered [[spalling]], steel corroded, and damp penetrated the buildings. <ref name="Power, A. 1997 p. 93">Power, A. (1997) ''Estates on the edge'', Great Britain, MacMillan, p. 93. </ref> Unfortunately, by replicating tower blocks across the nation, planners 'disastrously' replicated design faults. <ref name="Power, A. 1997 p. 57"/> In many tower blocks, concrete quickly exhibited signs of decay; cracks soon formed and destabilised the buildings. <ref name=Power59>Power, A. (1997) ''Estates on the edge'', Great Britain, MacMillan, p. 59</ref> The partial collapse of the [[Ronan Point]] tower block is an infamous example of the hasty and substandard construction that occurred in a number of the towers. The tower blocks quickly lost their 'futuristic' look; concrete turned from the crisp white the designers had imagined to a dull grey, stained by pollution. <ref>Hanley, L. (2007) ''Estates: an intimate history'', London, Granta Books, p. 119</ref> . 

Poor design decisions ruined the anticipated benefits of the buildings. Open spaces, which were supposed to benefit the residents, were instead unattractive, unused and inadequately supervised. <ref>Dunleavy, P. (1981) ''The politics of mass housing in Britain, 1945-1975'', Oxford, U.K, Clarendon Press, p. 98. </ref> Residents felt it was difficult to maintain the large open spaces around the blocks because they realistically belonged to no one. <ref>Power, A. (1997) ''Estates on the edge'', Great Britain, MacMillan, p. 92. </ref> Social problems increased as the tower blocks quickly degraded through poor maintenance and an insecure communal environment. <ref>Power, A. (1997) ''Estates on the edge'', Great Britain, MacMillan, p. 111. </ref> Apart from frequent break-downs, communal lifts were a source of fear for people travelling alone. <ref>Power, A. (1987) ''Property before people'', London, Allen & Unwin, p. 143. </ref> It was a rarity to 'enter a clean-smelling, undefaced lift'. <ref>Power, A. (1987) ''Property before people'', London, Allen & Unwin, p. 144. </ref> The tower blocks, many of which were located on the periphery of the city, made residents feel isolated and cut off from society. <ref>Power, A. (1997) ''Estates on the edge'', Great Britain, MacMillan, p. 95. </ref> Outsiders and newcomers were also affected; they felt the overbearing design of the tower blocks made them fearsome and unsociable. <ref>Power, A. (1997) ''Estates on the edge'', Great Britain, MacMillan. </ref> . 

Power argues that as a direct consequence of their design and construction, security problems were prevalent in many of the tower blocks. <ref name="Power, A. 1997 p. 93"/> Break-ins, vandalism and muggings were common, which were aided by the buildings' concealed areas, the mazes of internal corridors, and dark corners. <ref>Dunleavy, P. (1981) ''The politics of mass housing in Britain, 1945-1975'', Oxford, U.K, Clarendon Press, p. 97. </ref>  Police were often required in the tower blocks,<ref name="Hanley, L. 2007"/> but their infrequent presence did little to pacify towers rife with delinquency. 
In order to contain disruptive behaviour, local authorities began to place 'problem families' in the same blocks; Hanley argues that this policy only led to 'further alienation …nihilism and a creeping sense of lawlessness'. <ref>Hanley, L. (2007) ''Estates: an intimate history'', London, Granta Books, p. 124</ref>  [[Dunleavy]] seconds this, suggesting that the mental health of long term tower block residents may have been detrimentally affected. <ref>Dunleavy, P. (1981) ''The politics of mass housing in Britain, 1945-1975'', Oxford, U.K, Clarendon Press, p. 99</ref> . 

While local authorities and their architects intended to create tower blocks that encouraged harmonious and vibrant communities, often the results were far from ideal. Post-war tower blocks were compromised from the outset by a combination of faults: local authorities advocated impractical architectural methods; design and construction faults were frequently reproduced; and there appeared to be a lack of understanding about the social consequences of certain design features.  Collectively, these oversights transformed many tower blocks into undesirable places to live.

;Fire safety . 

The lives of residents in London Tower blocks are at risk because London councils have not done proper fire safety checks and the problem is probably widespread in the UK.

In buildings with more than a hundred residents ensuring that every single resident acts responsibly to minimize fire risk is impossible, and poorer residents in tower blocks may be tempted to use cheaper flammable fuels rather than electricity and also are more likely to be smokers and carelessness with cigarettes is a major cause of home fires, furthermore poor residents of tower blocks are more likely to have old furniture which was not made to modern fire safety standards.  Fire safety legislation introduced in London in 2006 requires new high rise buildings to be built to higher safety standards with sprinkler systems, these new buildings are mainly luxury accommodation for richer people. The legislation is not retrospective and does not protect poor people living in existing tower blocks. <ref>{{cite news|last=Davey |first=Ed |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8139264.stm |title=Are tower blocks a fire hazard? |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-07-08 |accessdate=2011-11-25}}</ref> . 

;Towards the present day . 

In recent years, some council or ex-council high-rises in the United Kingdom, including [[Trellick Tower]], [[Keeling House]], [[Sivill House]] and [[Barbican Estate|The Barbican Estate]], have become popular with young professionals due to their excellent views, desirable locations and architectural pedigrees, and now command high prices. There are plans to redevelop the [[Little London, Leeds|Little London]] and [[Lovell Park]] areas on the fringes of [[Leeds city centre]] into luxury flats for '[[Yuppie|Young Urban Professionals]]'. The plans entail demolishing all of the council housing and refurbishing the highrise flats. This demand has led to many councils rethinking plans regarding their demolition.  . 

After a gap of around 30 years, new high-rise flats are once again being built in [[Belfast]], [[Birmingham]] (some are for wealthy people, e.g. [[The Mailbox]], others are student accommodation.), [[Cardiff]], [[Aberdeen]], [[Glasgow]], [[Leeds]], [[Liverpool]], London, [[Manchester]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]; but this time sometimes for wealthy professionals, rather than the `[[lower class]]es`. Their developers market these properties by using the American term 'apartment buildings', perhaps in an effort to distance these newer buildings from the older tower blocks from the 1950s and 1960s. These are usually taller than their older counterparts and generally built in and around these provincial city centres. They are often glass and aluminium clad. [[Tonight (TV series)|Tonight with Trevor McDonald]] highlighted that in [[Leeds]] and [[Manchester]] (perhaps the cities that had seen most development) only approximately half were occupied and with owner occupation often being as low as 10%. In [[Southend]] there are controversial plans to build new tower blocks for social housing, a supporter claims this will be cheaper than paying to house [[poverty|poor]] people with private landlords while opponents fear the creation of [[Ghetto]]s. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/8763599.Anna_Waite__We_need_more_apartment_blocks_in_Southend/ |title=Anna Waite: We need more apartment blocks in Southend |publisher=Echo-news.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-11-25}}</ref> . 

Tower blocks in [[Northern Ireland]] were never built to the frequency as they were in other cities in Britain and Ireland. Most tower blocks and flat complexes are found in [[Belfast]] and [[Derry]], although many of these have been demolished in recent years and replaced with traditional public housing units. The Divis flats complex in west Belfast was built in between 1968 and 1972 was demolished in the early 1990s as the residents demanded new houses due to mounting problems with the flats. [[Divis Tower]], built separately in 1966, still stands, however; and, in 2007, work began to convert the former British Army base at the top two floors into new dwellings.  . 

In the north of the City, the iconic 7 towers complex in the [[New Lodge, Belfast|New Lodge]] remains, although so too the problems that residents face, such as poor piping and inadequate sanitation. Farther north, the 4 tower blocks in [[Rathcoole (Belfast)|Rathcoole]] still dominate the local skyline, while in south Belfast, the tower blocks in Seymour Hill also remain standing.  . 

===Ireland===. 
[[Image:Ballymun tower 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Flats in [[Ballymun]], [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]]]] . 

Most of the tower blocks in [[Northern Ireland]] UK are in [[Belfast]]. All of Belfast's flat complexes were built by [[Belfast Corporation]] as part of Belfast slum clearances and to solve the housing problem. The [[Ballymun Flats]] were built between 1966 and 1969 consisting of seven 15-storey towers, nineteen 8 storey blocks and ten 4 storey blocks. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/0313/ballymun.html |title=RTÉ News: Demolition of famous Dublin tower block |publisher=www.rte.ie |accessdate=2010-05-19 |date=2005-03-13}}</ref> These were the "seven towers" referred to in the U2 song "Running to Stand Still". Inner Dublin flat complexs include Sheriff Street (demolished), [[Fatima Mansions (housing)|Fatima Mansions]] (demolished and redeveloped), St. Joseph's Gardens (demolished; replaced by Killarney Court flat complex), St. Teresa's Gardens, Dolphin House, Liberty House, St. Michael's Estate and O'Devaney Gardens and a lot more mainly throughout the North and South Inner City of Dublin. Suburban flat complexes were built exclusively on the northside of the city in [[Ballymun]], [[Coolock]] and [[Kilbarrack]]. These flats were badly affected by a heroin epidemic that hit working-class areas of Dublin in the 1980s and early 90s.  . 

Over the last five years the largest cities such as Dublin, [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Limerick]] and [[Galway]] have witnessed new large apartment building. Some large towns such as [[Navan]], [[Drogheda]], [[Dundalk]] and [[Mullingar]] have also witnessed lots of modern apartments being built.  . 

===Eastern Europe===. 
{{See also|Panelák|Plattenbau}} . 

Russia is currently undergoing a dramatic buildout, growing a commercially-shaped skyline. [[Russians]], both poor and wealthy, from Soviet time had conserved the impression of prestige about tower blocks.  . 

===East Asia===. 
The unpopularity of tower blocks in Europe is in marked contrast to many Asian countries particularly in China, Singapore, Japan, and Korea.  . 

[[Image:koreatyp01.jpg|right|thumb|Typical Tower block apartment in South Korea]] . 

In South Korea the tower blocks are called "Apartment Complex ''(Apartment Danji)''". The first residential towers began to be built after the [[Korean War]]. The South Korean government needed to build many apartment complexes in the cities to be able to accommodate the citizens. In the 60 years since, as the population increased considerably, tower blocks have become more common. This time however the new tower blocks integrated shopping malls, parking system and other convenient facilities.  . 

In [[Singapore]] and urban Hong Kong, land prices are so high that almost the entire population lives in high-rise apartments. In fact, over 60% of Hong Kong residents live in apartments, many of them [[condominium]]s. [[Tower Palace]] in [[Seoul]], South Korea, is the tallest apartment complex in Asia.  . 

===Canada===. 
{{see also|List of tallest buildings in Canada}}
In Canada large [[multi-family buildings]] are usually known as ''apartment buildings'' or ''apartment blocks'' if they are rented from one common landowner, or ''condominiums'' or ''condo towers'' if each dwelling unit is individually owned; they may be called ''low-rise'' (or ''walk-up''), ''mid-rise'', ''high-rise'', or ''skyscraper'' depending on their height.  Tall residential towers are a staple building type in all large cities.  Their relative prominence in Canadian cities varies substantially, however.  In general, more populated cities have more high-rises than smaller cities, due to a relative the scarcity of land and a greater demand for housing.  . 

However, some cities such as Quebec City, Ottawa, and Halifax have fewer high-rise buildings due to several factors: a focus on [[historic preservation]], height restrictions, and lower growth rates. In middle-sized cities with a relatively low population density, such as Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, or Hamilton, there are more apartment towers but they are greatly outnumbered by [[single-family house]]s.  Most of the largest residential towers in Canada are found in Toronto, Vancouver, and (to a lesser extent) Montreal: the most densely-populated cities.  . 

[[Toronto]] contains the second largest concentration of high-rise apartment buildings in North America (after New York). In Canada, like in other New World countries, but unlike Western Europe, most high-rise towers are located in the city centre (or "downtown"), where smaller, older buildings were demolished to make way in [[redevelopment]] schemes.  Toronto, however has many high-rise apartment and condominium communities in its denser suburbs in addition to downtown. [[Greenfield land|Greenfield]] high-rise development in the [[suburbs]] of Canadian cities is much more rare, although it does happen, particularly in [[transit-oriented development]]s.  .

In the United States tower blocks are commonly referred to as "midrise" or "highrise apartment buildings", depending on their height, while buildings that house fewer flats (apartments), or are not as tall as the tower blocks, are called "lowrise apartment buildings".  . 

Some of the first residential towers were the [[Castle Village]] towers in New York City completed in 1939. Their cross-shaped design was copied in towers in [[Parkchester, Bronx|Parkchester]] and [[Stuyvesant Town]] residential developments.  . 

The government's experiments in the 1960s and 70s to use high-rise apartments as a means of providing the housing solution for the poor resulted in a spectacular failure. All but a few high-rise [[Public housing|housing projects]] in the nation's largest [[city|cities]], such as [[Cabrini–Green]] and [[Robert Taylor Homes]] in Chicago, Penn South in [[New York, New York|New York]] and the Desire projects in [[New Orleans]], fell victim to the "[[ghetto]]fication" and are now being torn down, renovated, or replaced.  . 

In contrast to their [[public housing]] cousins, commercially developed high-rise apartment buildings continue to flourish in cities around the country largely due to high land prices and the housing boom of the 2000s. The [[Upper East Side]] in New York City and Chicago's [[Near North Side, Chicago#Gold Coast|Gold Coast]], both featuring high-rise apartments, are the wealthiest urban neighborhoods in the United States.  . 

Currently, the tallest high-rise apartment building and tower block in the world is Chicago's [[John Hancock Center]], constructed by [[Bangladesh]]i engineer [[Fazlur Khan]] in 1969. The building has 100 storeys and stands at 344 meters tall. <ref name="Emporis"/> . 

===Australia===.

High-rise living in Australia was limited to small pockets of bohemian inner Sydney until the 1960s, where a short-lived fashion saw public housing tenants located in new high-rise developments, especially in Sydney and Melbourne. The buildings pictured along with four other 16 storey blocks were constructed on behalf of the Royal Australian Navy and were available to sailors and their families for accommodation. Due to social problems within these blocks the Navy left and the Department of Housing took charge and flats were let to low income and immigrant families. During the 1980s many people escaping communisum in Eastern block countries were housed in these buildings. Developers have enthusiastically adopted the term 'apartment' for these new high-rise blocks, perhaps to avoid the stigma still attached to housing commission flats.  . 

==Definition==. 
Although there is no precise definition that is universally accepted, various bodies have tried to define what 'high-rise' means: . 

*[[Emporis Standards]] defines a high-rise as "A multi-storey structure between 35-100 metres tall, or a building of unknown height from 12-39 floors."<ref>[http://standards.emporis.com/?nav=realestate&lng=3&esn=18727 Data Standards: high-rise building (ESN 18727)], [[Emporis Standards]].  Accessed on line October 16, 2009. </ref>
*According to the building code of [[Hyderabad, India]], a high-rise building is one with four floors or more, or one 15 metres or more in height. <ref>p. 57, ''Urban redevelopment: a study of high-rise buildings'', K. Narayan Reddy, Concept Publishing Company, 1996, ISBN 81-7022-531-0. </ref>
*The ''New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'' defines a high-rise as "a building having many storeys". 
*The ''International Conference on Fire Safety in High-Rise Buildings'' defined a high-rise as "any structure where the height can have a serious impact on evacuation"{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
*[[Massachusetts]], United States General Laws define a high-rise as being higher than 70 feet (21&nbsp;m).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
*Most building engineers, inspectors, architects and similar professions define a high-rise as a building that is at least 75 feet (23&nbsp;m) tall.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} . 

==Streets in the sky==. 
[[File:Park Hill deck.JPG|thumb|right|"Street in the sky" at Park Hill]]
Streets in the sky is a term used to describe a style of [[architecture]] that emerged in Britain in the [[1960s]] and [[1970s]]. Generally built to replace run-down [[terraced house|terraced housing]], the new designs included not only modern improvements such as inside [[toilet]]s, but also shops and other community facilities within [[high-rise]] blocks. <ref name=intute>{{cite web|url=http://www.intute.ac.uk/hottopics/2006/11/streets-in-the-sky/ |title=Streets in the Sky |publisher=Intute.ac.uk |date=2006-11-01 |accessdate=2010-08-08}}</ref>
Examples of the buildings and developments are [[Trellick Tower]], [[Balfron Tower]], [[Robin Hood Gardens]] and [[Keeling House]] in London, [[Hunslet Grange]] in [[Leeds]] and [[Park Hill, Sheffield]]. These were an attempt to develop a new architecture, differentiated from earlier large housing estates, such as [[Quarry Hill, Leeds|Quarry Hill flats]] in Leeds. <ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/leeds/content/image_galleries/image_gallery_quarry_hill_gallery.shtml Quarry Hill] at BBC Online</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newenglishreview.org/custpage.cfm/frm/42007/sec_id/42007 |title=Social Engineering Through Architectural Change |publisher=Newenglishreview.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-08}}</ref> . 

[[Alison and Peter Smithson]] were the architects of [[Robin Hood Gardens]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://designmuseum.org/design/alison-peter-smithson |title=Alison and Peter Smithson, Design Museum |publisher=Designmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-08}}</ref> Another large example, the [[Aylesbury Estate]] in South London, built in 1970, is about to be demolished. <ref>[http://property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/article4964769.ece Demolition of the Aylesbury Estate: a new dawn for Hell's waiting room?], ''The Times'', 20 October 2008</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://aylesburytenantsfirst.org.uk/ |title=Aylesbury Tenants First |publisher=Aylesbury Tenants First |date= |accessdate=2010-08-08}}</ref> . 

==Deck access==. 
Deck access is a term used to describe flats that are accessed from a walkway that is open to the elements, as opposed to flats that are accessed from fully enclosed internal corridors. Deck access blocks of flats are usually fairly low-rise structures. The decks can vary from simple walkways, which may be covered or uncovered, to decks wide enough for small vehicles.  The best known example of deck-access flats in the UK is [[Park Hill, Sheffield]], where the decks are wide enough to allow electric vehicles; however, the design is inspired by French Modernist architect [[Le Corbusier]], particularly his [[Unite D'Habitation]] in [[Marseilles]]. <ref>BBC 'English Heritage' documentary about Park Hill flats. </ref> . 

==Green tower blocks==. 
Green tower blocks have some scheme of living plants or [[Green roof]]s <ref>http://www.sustainingtowers.org/ROOFa.htm</ref> or [[solar panels]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salford.gov.uk/pr-10-2680.htm |title=Tower blocks go green with power-saving panels |publisher=Salford.gov.uk |date=2010-09-20 |accessdate=2011-11-25}}</ref> on their roofs and/or incorporate other [[environmentally friendly]] design features. <ref>http://www.sustainingtowers.org/SOA-present.htm</ref> .
