<!-- This [[Template:Anchor|Anchor]] is being used, please don't remove -->{{anchor|350safe}}The organising effort drew its name from climate scientist James Hansen's contention in winter 2008 that any atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> above 350 parts per million was unsafe. James Hansen opined that "if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on Earth is [[adapted]], paleoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that CO<sub>2</sub> will need to be reduced from its current 385 ppm to at most 350 ppm, but likely less than that."<ref>[[James Hansen|Hansen, J.]], et al. “[http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abstracts/2008/Hansen_etal.html Target atmospheric CO2: Where should humanity aim?]” ''Open Atmos.

McKibben first started to organize against global warming with a walk across [[Vermont]], his home state. His "[[Step It Up 2007|Step It Up]]" campaign in 2007  involved 1,400 demonstrations at famous sites across the United States. McKibben credits these activities with making [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] change their [[Energy policy of the United States|energy policies]] during the presidential campaign. Later, the [[Climate change in the Arctic|continued melting of the polar cap]] pushed him into starting 350.org, based on Hansen's 2007 book ''Climate Code Red''. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1113858.html |title=350 and counting |publisher=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=2009-09-15 }}</ref> .

As a follow-up to 2009's International Day of Climate Action, 350.org and the [[10:10]] campaign joined to help coordinate another global day of action which occurred on October 10th, 2010. The 2010 campaign is focused on concrete actions that can be taken locally to help combat climate change. Actions from tree-plantings to solar panel installations to huge electricity service-provider switching parties occurred in almost every country around the world. <ref>[http://www.lohud.com/article/20101011/NEWS02/10110329/-1/newsfront/Community-Gardeners-in-Ossining-have-own-Global-Work-Party Community Gardeners in Ossining have own Global Work Party | LoHud.com | The Journal News]</ref><ref>[http://www.wlbt.com/Global/story.asp?S=13300079 Global work party focuses on global warming prevention - WLBT 3 - Jackson, MS]</ref><ref>[http://www.mercurynews.com/science/ci_16305629?nclick_check=1 Silicon Valley joins Global Work Party to combat climate change - San Jose Mercury News]</ref> .
