'''Oil sands,''' '''tar sands''' or, more technically, '''bituminous sands,''' are a type of [[unconventional oil|unconventional petroleum deposit]]. The oil sands are loose sand or partially consolidated sandstone containing naturally occurring mixtures of [[sand]], [[clay]], and water, [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] with a dense and extremely [[viscous]] form of [[petroleum]] technically referred to as [[bitumen]] (or colloquially [[tar]] due to its similar appearance, odour and colour). Natural bitumen deposits are reported in many countries, but in particular are found in extremely large quantities in [[Canada]]. <ref name=wec/><ref name="AOS2008">

Oil sands reserves have only recently been considered to be part of the world's [[oil reserves]], as higher oil prices and new technology enable them to be profitably extracted and upgraded to usable products. They are often referred to as [[unconventional oil]] or crude bitumen, in order to distinguish the bitumen extracted from oil sands from the free-flowing hydrocarbon mixtures known as [[crude oil]] traditionally produced from [[oil wells]].  . 

The crude bitumen contained in the Canadian oil sands is described by Canadian authorities as "petroleum that exists in the semi-solid or solid phase in natural deposits. Bitumen is a thick, sticky form of crude oil, so heavy and viscous (thick) that it will not flow unless heated or diluted with lighter [[hydrocarbons]]. At room temperature, it is much like cold [[molasses]]". <ref>

==History==. 
The exploitation of bituminous deposits and [[Petroleum seep|seeps]] dates back to [[Paleolithic]] times. <ref>{{Cite news  | last = Bilkadi | first = Zayn | title = Bitumen - A History | newspaper = Saudi Aramco World | pages = 2–9 | date = November/December 1984 | url = http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198406/bitumen.-.a.history.htm | accessdate =1 January 2011 }}</ref>  The earliest known use of bitumen was by [[Neanderthal]]s, some 40,000&nbsp;years ago. Bitumen has been found adhering to [[stone tool]]s used by [[Neanderthal]]s at sites in [[Syria]]. After the arrival of [[Homo sapiens]], humans used bitumen for construction of buildings and water proofing of [[reed boat]]s, among other uses. In ancient [[Egypt]], the use of bitumen was important in creating Egyptian mummies—in fact, the word [[mummy]] is derived from the [[Arabic language|Arab word]] ''mūmiyyah'', which means bitumen. <ref>{{cite web| last=Hirst | first=K.

In ancient times, bitumen was primarily a [[Mesopotamian]] commodity used by the [[Sumerians]] and [[Babylonians]], although it was also found in the [[Levant]] and [[Persia]]. The area along the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates river]]s was littered with hundreds of pure bitumen seepages. The Mesopotamians used the bitumen for waterproofing boats and buildings. In North America, the early European [[fur traders]] found [[First Nations|Canadian First Nations]] using bitumen from the vast [[Athabasca oil sands]] to waterproof their [[birch bark]] canoes. <ref>{{Cite book| last=Mackenzie | first=Sir Alexander | year=1970 | title=The Journals and Letters of Alexander Mackenzie | editor=Lamb, W.

The name ''tar sands'' was applied to bituminous sands in the late 19th and early 20th century. People who saw the bituminous sands during this period were familiar with the large amounts of tar residue produced in urban areas as a [[by-product]] of the manufacture of [[coal gas]] for urban heating and lighting. <ref>{{Cite journal| title=Coal Tar | year=2007 | publisher=City of Kingston, Ontario |url=http://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/environment/coaltar/index.asp | accessdate=13 May 2008}}</ref>  The word "[[tar]]" to describe these natural bitumen deposits is really a misnomer, since, chemically speaking, tar is a [[synthetic oil|human-made]] substance produced by the [[destructive distillation]] of [[organic material]], usually [[coal]]. <ref name="Alberta's oil sands">{{Cite journal| title=Alberta's oil sands | year=2007 | publisher=Government of Alberta | url=http://oilsands.alberta.ca/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080410204658/http://oilsands.alberta.ca/ |archivedate=10 April 2008 }}</ref> . 

Since then, coal gas has almost completely been replaced by [[natural gas]] as a fuel, and [[coal tar]] as a material for [[pavement (material)|paving roads]] has been replaced by the petroleum product [[asphalt]]. Naturally occurring bitumen is chemically more similar to asphalt than to tar, and the term ''oil sands'' (or oilsands) is more commonly used in the producing areas than ''tar sands'' because [[synthetic oil]] is what is manufactured from the bitumen. <ref name="Alberta's oil sands"/>  Oil sands are now an alternative to conventional crude oil. <ref name="Evans">{{Cite journal| author=Evans, John | title=Sand banks: If unconventional sources of oil, such as oil sands, could be transformed into crude we could still have a 300-year supply left.

==Reserves==. 
According to the WEC, natural bitumen is reported in 598&nbsp;deposits in 23&nbsp;countries, with the largest deposits in Canada, Kazakhstan, and Russia. Discovered original oil in place is {{convert|2511.326|Goilbbl}} and total original oil in place is estimated {{convert|3328.598|Goilbbl}}. Natural bitumen reserves are estimated at {{convert|249.67|Goilbbl}} globally, of which {{convert|176.8|Goilbbl}} are in Canada, {{convert|42.009|Goilbbl}} in Kazakhstan and {{convert|28.38|Goilbbl}} in Russia. <ref name=wec/> . 

Most of the oil sands of Canada are located in three major deposits in northern [[Alberta]]. These are the Athabasca-Wabiskaw oil sands of north northeastern Alberta, the [[Cold Lake, Alberta|Cold Lake]] deposits of east northeastern Alberta, and the [[Peace River, Alberta|Peace River]] deposits of northwestern Alberta. Between them they cover over {{convert|140000|km2|sqmi}}—an area larger than [[England]]—and hold proven reserves of {{convert|1.75|Toilbbl|e9m3|sigfig=2}} of [[bitumen]] in place. About 10% of this, or {{convert|173|Goilbbl|e9m3}}, is estimated by the [[government of Alberta]] to be recoverable at current prices, using current technology, which amounts to 97% of Canadian oil reserves and 75% of total North American petroleum reserves. <ref name="AOS2008"/>  The Cold Lake deposits extend across the Alberta's eastern border into Saskatchewan. In addition to the Alberta oil sands, there are major oil sands deposits on [[Melville Island, Canada|Melville Island]] in the [[Canadian Arctic islands]], which are unlikely to see commercial production in the foreseeable future. The largest bitumen deposit, containing about 80% of the Alberta total, and the only one suitable for [[surface mining]], is the Athabasca oil sands along the [[Athabasca River]]. The mineable area (as defined by the Alberta government) includes 37&nbsp;[[township (Canada)#Western Canada|townships]] covering about {{convert|3400|km2|sqmi}} near [[Fort McMurray]]. The smaller Cold Lake deposits are important because some of the oil is [[fluid]] enough to be extracted by conventional methods. All three Alberta areas are suitable for production using ''[[in-situ]]'' methods, such as cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) and [[steam assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD).  . 

Several other countries hold oil sands deposits which are smaller by orders of magnitude. In Kazakhstan, the bitumen deposits are located
in the North Caspian Basin. Russia holds oil sands in two main regions. Large resources are present in the Tunguska Basin, [[East Siberia]], with the largest deposits being Olenek and Siligir. Other deposits are located in the [[Timan-Pechora Basin|Timan-Pechora]] and Volga-Urals basins (in and around [[Tatarstan]]), which is an important but very mature province in terms of conventional oil, holds large amounts of oil sands in a shallow permian formation. <ref name=wec/><ref>

==Extraction process==. 
Conventional crude oil is normally extracted from the ground by drilling [[oil well]]s into a [[petroleum reservoir]], allowing oil to flow into them under natural reservoir pressures, although [[artificial lift]] and techniques such as [[water injection (oil production)|water flooding]] and gas injection are usually required to maintain production as reservoir pressure drops toward the end of a field's life. Because bitumen flow very slowly, if at all, toward producing wells under normal reservoir conditions, the sands must be extracted by [[strip mining]] or the oil made to flow into wells by ''in-situ'' techniques, which reduce the viscosity by injecting [[steam]], [[solvent]]s, and/or hot air into the sands. These processes can use more water and require larger amounts of energy than conventional oil extraction, although many conventional oil fields also require large amounts of water and energy to achieve good rates of production.  . 

It is estimated that approximately 90% of the Alberta oil sands are too far below the surface to use [[open-pit mining]]. Several ''in-situ'' techniques have been developed. <ref>

===Surface mining===. 
Since Great Canadian Oil Sands (now Suncor) started operation of its mine in 1967, bitumen has been extracted on a commercial scale from the Athabasca Oil Sands by [[surface mining]]. In the Athabasca sands there are very large amounts of bitumen covered by little overburden, making surface mining the most efficient method of extracting it. The overburden consists of water-laden [[muskeg]] (peat bog) over top of clay and barren sand. The oil sands themselves are typically {{convert|40|to|60|m}} deep, sitting on top of flat [[limestone]] rock. Originally, the sands were mined with [[dragline]]s and [[bucket-wheel excavator]]s and moved to the processing plants by [[conveyor belt]]s. In recent years companies such as Syncrude and Suncor have switched to much cheaper shovel-and-truck operations using the biggest [[power shovel]]s (100 or more tons) and [[dump truck]]s (400 tons) in the world. <ref>

After excavation, hot water and [[caustic soda]] (NaOH) is added to the sand, and the resulting slurry is piped to the extraction plant where it is agitated and the oil skimmed from the top. <ref>

}}</ref>  Provided that the water chemistry is appropriate to allow bitumen to separate from sand and clay, the combination of hot water and agitation releases bitumen from the oil sand, and allows small air bubbles to attach to the bitumen droplets. The bitumen froth floats to the top of separation vessels, and is further treated to remove residual water and fine solids.  . 

About two tons of oil sands are required to produce one barrel (roughly 1/8 of a ton) of oil. Originally, roughly 75% of the bitumen was recovered from the sand. However, recent enhancements to this method include [[Tailings]] Oil Recovery (TOR) units which recover oil from the [[tailings]], [[Diluent]] Recovery Units to recover [[naptha]] from the froth, Inclined Plate Settlers (IPS) and disc centrifuges. These allow the extraction plants to recover well over 90% of the bitumen in the sand. After oil extraction, the spent sand and other materials are then returned to the mine, which is eventually reclaimed.  . 

[[Alberta Taciuk Process]] technology extracts bitumen from oil sands through a dry-retorting. During this process, oil sand is moved through a rotating drum, [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] the bitumen with heat and producing lighter hydrocarbons. Although tested, this technology is not in commercial use yet. <ref name=atp>

===Cold flow===. 
{{Main|Cold heavy oil production with sand}}
In this technique, also known as cold heavy oil production with sand (CHOPS), the oil is simply pumped out of the sands, often using [[progressive cavity pump]]s. This only works well in areas where the oil is [[fluid]] enough. It is commonly used in Venezuela (where the extra-heavy oil is at 50 degrees [[Celsius]]), and also in the Wabasca, Alberta Oil Sands, the southern part of the Cold Lake Oil Sands and the Peace River Oil Sands. It has the advantage of being cheap and the disadvantage that it recovers only 5-6% of the [[oil in place]]. <ref>

Some years ago Canadian oil companies discovered that if they removed the [[sand]] filters from the wells and produced as much sand as possible with the oil, production rates improved remarkably. This technique became known as Cold Heavy Oil Production with Sand (CHOPS). Further research disclosed that pumping out sand opened "wormholes" in the sand formation which allowed more oil to reach the wellbore. The advantage of this method is better production rates and recovery (around 10%) and the disadvantage that [[waste management|disposing]] of the produced sand is a problem. A novel way to do this was spreading it on [[gravel road|rural roads]], which rural governments liked because the [[tarmac|oily sand]] reduced dust and the oil companies did their [[road#Maintenance|road maintenance]] for them. However, governments have become concerned about the large volume and composition of oil spread on roads,<ref>

===Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS)===. 
{{See also|Steam injection (oil industry)}} . 

The use of [[steam]] injection to recover heavy oil has been in use in the oil fields of California since the 1950s. The Cyclic Steam Stimulation or "huff-and-puff" method has been in use by [[Imperial Oil]] at Cold Lake since 1985 and is also used by [[Canadian Natural Resources]] at Primrose and Wolf Lake and by Shell Canada at Peace River. In this method, the well is put through cycles of steam injection, soak, and oil production. First, steam is injected into a well at a temperature of 300 to 340 degrees [[Celsius]] for a period of weeks to months; then, the well is allowed to sit for days to weeks to allow heat to soak into the formation; and, later, the hot oil is pumped out of the well for a period of weeks or months. Once the production rate falls off, the well is put through another cycle of injection, soak and production. This process is repeated until the cost of injecting steam becomes higher than the money made from producing oil. <ref name="butler104">{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Roger|title=Thermal Recovery of Oil and Bitumen|year=1991|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs|page=104}}</ref>  The CSS method has the advantage that recovery factors are around 20 to 25% and the disadvantage that the cost to inject steam is high.  . 

===Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD)===. 
{{Main|Steam assisted gravity drainage}}
[[Steam assisted gravity drainage]] was developed in the 1980s by the [[Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority]] and fortuitously coincided with improvements in [[directional drilling]] technology that made it quick and inexpensive to do by the mid 1990s. In SAGD, two horizontal wells are drilled in the oil sands, one at the bottom of the formation and another about 5 metres above it. These wells are typically [[drilling rig|drilled]] in groups off central pads and can extend for miles in all directions. In each well pair, steam is injected into the upper well, the heat melts the bitumen, which allows it to flow into the lower well, where it is pumped to the surface. <ref name="butler104"/> . 

SAGD has proved to be a [[disruptive technology|major breakthrough]] in production technology since it is cheaper than CSS, allows very high oil production rates, and recovers up to 60% of the oil in place. Because of its very [[production, costs, and pricing|favorable economics]] and applicability to a vast area of oil sands, this method alone quadrupled North American [[oil reserves]] and allowed Canada to move to second place in world oil reserves after Saudi Arabia. Most major Canadian oil companies now have SAGD projects in production or under construction in Alberta's oil sands areas and in Wyoming. Examples include [[JACOS|Japan Canada Oil Sands Ltd's (JACOS)]] project, Suncor's Firebag project, [[Nexen]]'s Long Lake project, Suncor's (formerly Petro-Canada's) MacKay River project, [[Husky Energy]]'s Tucker Lake and Sunrise projects, Shell Canada's Peace River project, [[Cenovus Energy]]'s Foster Creek<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cenovus.com/operations/oil/foster-creek.html |title=Operations - Oil - Foster Creek |publisher=Cenovus.com |date= |accessdate=18 February 2011}}</ref> and Christina Lake<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cenovus.com/operations/oil/christina-lake.html |title=Operations - Oil - Christina Lake |publisher=Cenovus.com |date= |accessdate=18 February 2011}}</ref> developments, [[ConocoPhillips]]' Surmont project, [[Devon Energy|Devon Canada's]] Jackfish project, and Derek Oil & Gas's LAK Ranch project. Alberta's OSUM Corp has combined proven underground mining technology with SAGD to enable higher recovery rates by running wells underground from within the oil sands deposit, thus also reducing energy requirements compared to traditional SAGD. This particular technology application is in its testing phase.  . 

===Vapor Extraction Process (VAPEX)===. 
VAPEX is similar to SAGD but instead of steam, hydrocarbon solvents are injected into the upper well to dilute the bitumen and allow it to flow into the lower well. It has the advantage of much better energy efficiency over steam injection, and it does some partial upgrading of bitumen to oil right in the formation. It is very new, but the process has attracted much attention from oil companies, who are beginning to experiment with it.  . 

The above three methods are not mutually exclusive. It is becoming common for wells to be put through one CSS injection-soak-production cycle to condition the formation prior to going to SAGD production, and companies are experimenting with combining VAPEX with SAGD to improve recovery rates and lower energy costs.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} . 

===Toe to Heel Air Injection (THAI)===. 
This is a very new and experimental method that combines a vertical air injection well with a horizontal production well. The process ignites oil in the reservoir and creates a vertical wall of fire moving from the "toe" of the horizontal well toward the "heel", which burns the heavier oil components and upgrades some of the heavy bitumen into lighter oil right in the formation. Historically fireflood projects have not worked out well because of difficulty in controlling the flame front and a propensity to set the producing wells on fire. However, some oil companies feel the THAI method will be more controllable and practical, and have the advantage of not requiring energy to create steam. <ref>

===Combustion Overhead Gravity Drainage (COGD)===. 
This is an experimental method that employs a number of vertical air injection wells above a horizontal production well located at the base of the bitumen pay zone. An initial Steam Cycle similar to CSS is used to prepare the bitumen for ignition and mobility. Following that cycle, air is injected into the vertical wells, igniting the upper bitumen and mobilizing (through heating) the lower bitumen to flow into the production well. It is expected that COGD will result in water savings of 80% compared to SAGD. <ref>

==Transportation and refining==. 
The heavy crude oil or crude bitumen extracted from oil sands is a viscous, solid or semisolid form that does not easily flow at normal [[oil pipeline]] temperatures, making it difficult to transport to market and expensive to process into [[gasoline]], [[diesel fuel]], and other products. It must be either mixed with lighter petroleum (either liquid or gas) or chemically split before it can be transported by pipeline for upgrading into synthetic crude oil.  . 

Heavy crude feedstock needs pre-processing before it is fit for conventional refineries. This pre-processing is called 'upgrading', the key components of which are as follows:
# removal of water, sand, physical waste, and lighter products
# catalytic purification by [[hydrodemetallisation]] (HDM), [[hydrodesulfurization]] (HDS) and [[hydrodenitrogenation]] (HDN)
# hydrogenation through carbon rejection or [[catalytic hydrocracking]] (HCR) . 

As carbon rejection is very inefficient and wasteful in most cases, [[catalytic hydrocracking]] is preferred in most cases. All these processes take large amounts of energy and water, while emitting more carbon dioxide than conventional oil.  . 

Catalytic purification and hydrocracking are together known as [[hydroprocessing]]. The big challenge in hydroprocessing is to deal with the impurities found in heavy crude, as they poison the catalysts over time. Many efforts have been made to deal with this to ensure high activity and long life of a catalyst. Catalyst materials and pore size distributions are key parameters that need to be optimized to deal with this challenge and varies from place to place, depending on the kind of feedstock present. <ref>

In October 2009, Suncor announced it was seeking government approval for a new process to recover tailings called Tailings Reduction Operations, which accelerates the [[settling]] of fine clay, sand, water, and residual bitumen in [[pond]]s after oil sands extraction. The technology involves dredging mature tailings from a pond bottom, mixing the [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] with a polymer [[flocculent]], and spreading the sludge-like mixture over a "beach" with a shallow grade. According to the company, the process could reduce the time for [[water reclamation]] from tailings to weeks rather than years, with the recovered water being [[water conservation|recycled]] into the oil sands plant. In addition to reducing the number of tailing ponds, Suncor claims that the process could reduce the time to reclaim a tailing pond from 40 years at present to 7–10 years, with [[land rehabilitation]] continuously following 7 to 10 years behind the mining operations. <ref>

They concluded that they would yield a mean total of 12.6 teratonne of carbon leading to an 18.85 C temperature rise.

Comparing their figures for coal to those for unconventional oil, the global reserves of coal offer 20-fold the energy at a cost of 40-fold the carbon and 28-fold the global temperature rise. <ref>{{Cite journal |title=The Alberta oil sands and climate |author=Neil C.

===Aquatic life deformities===. 
There is conflicting research on the effects of the oil sands development on aquatic life. In 2007, Environment Canada completed a study that shows high deformity rates in fish embryos exposed to the oil sands.  [[David W. Schindler]], a limnologist from the [[University of Alberta]], co-authored a study on Alberta's oil sands' contribution of [[Aromaticity|aromatic]] [[polycyclic compound]]s, some of which are known [[carcinogen]]s, to the Athabasca River and its tributaries. <ref>{{cite journal

The bulk of the research that defends the oil sands development is done by the Regional Aquatics Monitoring Program (RAMP). RAMP studies show that deformity rates are normal compared to historical data and the deformity rates in rivers upstream of the oil sands. <ref>{{cite web

===Public health impacts===. 
Concerns have been raised concerning the negative impacts that the oil sands have on public health, including higher than normal rates of [[cancer]] among residents of [[Fort Chipewyan]]. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE51568020090206 | work=Reuters | title=High cancer rates confirmed near Canada's oil sands | date=6 February 2009}}</ref>  In August, 2011, the Alberta government initiated a provincial health study of the link between the higher rates of cancer and the oil sands. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2011/08/19/edm-cancer-oilsands-fort-chipewyan-study.html | work=CBC News | title=Cancer rates downstream from oil sands to be probed | date=19 August 2011}}</ref> It has also been suggested that other wildlife has been negatively affected by the oil sands; for instance, moose were found in a 2006 study to have as high as 453 times the acceptable levels of [[arsenic]] in their systems, though later studies lowered this to 17 to 33 times the acceptable level (still causing a danger for human consumption). <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/story/2007/04/03/game-alberta.html?ref=rss | work=CBC News | title=Mixed reports on safety of eating northern Alberta game | date=3 April 2007}}</ref> . 

==Input energy==. 
Approximately {{convert|1.0|–|1.25|GJ}} of energy is needed to extract a barrel of bitumen and upgrade it to synthetic crude. As of 2006, most of this is produced by burning natural gas. <ref>

}}</ref>  Since a [[barrel of oil equivalent]] is about {{convert|6.117|GJ}}, its [[Energy returned on energy invested|EROEI]] is 5–6. That means this extracts about 5 or 6 times as much energy as is consumed. Energy efficiency is expected to improve to average of {{convert|900|cuft}} of natural gas or {{convert|0.945|GJ}} of energy per barrel by 2015, giving an EROEI of about 6.5. <ref>

Alternatives to natural gas exist and are available in the oil sands area. Bitumen can itself be used as the fuel, consuming about 30-35% of the raw bitumen per produced unit of synthetic crude. Nexen's Long Lake project will use a proprietary deasphalting technology to upgrade the bitumen, using asphaltene residue fed to a [[gasification|gasifier]] whose [[syngas]] will be used by a [[cogeneration]] turbine and a hydrogen producing unit, providing all the energy needs of the project: steam, hydrogen, and electricity. <ref>

Coal is widely available in Alberta and is inexpensive, but produces large amounts of greenhouse gases.  [[Nuclear power]] and even [[nuclear explosive]]s have been proposed for the input energy<ref>
