The '''Keystone Pipeline System''' is a [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] system to transport [[synthetic crude oil]] and diluted [[bitumen]] ("[[dilbit]]") from the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] in northeastern [[Alberta]], [[Canada]] to multiple destinations in the [[United States]], which include refineries in [[Illinois]], the Cushing oil distribution hub in [[Oklahoma]], and proposed connections to refineries and export terminals<ref name="ILR Cornell Study" /><ref name="NYTKeystoneXL" >{{cite news|title=Keystone XL Pipeline |date=28 February 2012 |publisher=New York Times |http=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/k/keystone_pipeline/index.html}}</ref> along the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] of [[Texas]].  It consists of the operational "Keystone Pipeline" (Phase 1) and "Keystone-Cushing Extension" (Phase 2), and two proposed Keystone XL pipeline expansion segments.  After the Keystone XL pipeline segments are completed, American crude oil would enter the XL pipelines at [[Baker, Montana]] and [[Cushing, Oklahoma]]. <ref name="system-doc" /> . 

The Keystone XL has faced [[lawsuit]]s from [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] and criticism from [[environmentalist]]s and some members of the [[United States Congress]].  The [[U.S. Department of State]] in 2010 extended the deadline for [[federal agencies]] to decide if the pipeline is in the [[national interest]], and in November, 2011, [[Presidency of Barack Obama|President Obama]] postponed the decision until 2013.  . 

==History==. 
===Keystone Pipeline===. 
[[TransCanada Corporation]] proposed the project  on February 9, 2005. In October 2007, the [[Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada]] asked the Canadian federal government to block regulatory approvals for the pipeline, with union president Dave Coles stating that 'the Keystone pipeline will exclusively serve US markets, create permanent employment for very few Canadians, reduce our energy security, and hinder investment and job creation in the Canadian energy sector'. <ref>

The original Keystone Pipeline cost US$5.2&nbsp;billion with the Keystone XL expansion slated to cost approximately US$7&nbsp;billion.  The Keystone XL is expected to be completed by 2012–2013. <ref name=downstream2/> . 

==Partnership==. 
The project was originally developed as a partnership between TransCanada and ConocoPhillips. Certain parties who have agreed to make volume commitments to the Keystone expansion have an option to acquire up to a combined 15% equity ownership. <ref name=downstream2>

*Electricity plants powered by coal in the U.S. generate almost 40 times more greenhouse-gas emissions than Canada's oil sands (the coal-fired electricity plants in the State of Wisconsin alone produce the equivalent of the entire GHG emissions of the oil sands). 
*California bitumen is more GHG-intensive than the oil sands.

</ref> After completion of the Keystone XL line, oil pipelines to the U.S. may run nearly half-empty. The expected lack of volume combined with extensive construction cost overruns has prompted several petroleum refining companies to sue TransCanada.  Suncor Energy hoped to recoup significant construction-related tolls, though the U.S. Energy Regulatory Commission did not rule in their favor.  According to [[The Globe and Mail]], 
<blockquote>The refiners argue that construction overruns have raised the cost of shipping on the Canadian portion of Keystone by 145 per cent while the U.S. portion has run 92 per cent over budget. They accuse TransCanada of misleading them when they signed shipping contracts in the summer of 2007. TransCanada nearly doubled its construction estimates in October, 2007, from $2.8-billion (U.S.) to $5.2-billion. <ref name = "theglobeandmail-1548807">

Due to an exemption the state of Kansas gave TransCanada, the local authorities would lose $50&nbsp;million public revenue from property taxes for a decade. <ref name="mcclatchydc.com20110213"/> . 

===2011 protests and postponement===. 
[[Image:Keystone XL demonstration, 8-2011.jpg|thumb|Demonstration against the Keystone XL extension, [[White House]],  August 2011.]]
Starting in spring, 2011, environmental and [[global warming]] activist [[Bill McKibben]] took the question of the pipeline to NASA scientist [[James Hansen]], who told McKibben the pipeline would be "game over for the planet". <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.countercurrents.org/ross050112.htm | title="Game Over" For Planet If XL Oil Pipeline Is Built | publisher=countercurrents.org | date=January 5, 2012 | accessdate=January 10, 2012 | author=Ross, Sherwood}}</ref> McKibben and other activists moved toward a new oppositional approach which coalesced in August with over 1000&nbsp;nonviolent arrests at the [[White House]]. They promised to continue to challenge President Obama to stand by his 2008 call to "be the generation that finally frees America from the tyranny of oil"<ref name=NYer01 /> as he entered the 2012 reelection campaign. A relatively broad coalition came together, including the Republican governor [[Dave Heineman]] and senators [[Ben Nelson]] (D) and [[Mike Johanns]] (R) from Nebraska, and some Democratic funders like [[Susie Tompkins Buell]]. <ref name=NYer01>

On November 7, 2011, several thousand environmentalist supporters, some shouldering a long black inflatable replica of a pipeline, formed a human chain around the White House to try to convince Barack Obama to block the controversial Keystone XL project. Organiser Bill McKibben said, "this has become not only the biggest environmental flash point in many, many years, but maybe the issue in recent times in the Obama administration when he's been most directly confronted by people in the street. In this case, people willing, hopeful, almost dying for him to be the Barack Obama of 2008."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/nov/09/keystone-xl-pipeline-obama-reelection | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Amy | last=Goodman | title=Keystone: pipeline to Obama's re-election | date=2011-11-09}}</ref>  . 

On November 10, 2011, four days after twelve thousand people encircled the White House, the culmination of months of protests, President Obama announced "the decision on the pipeline permit would be delayed until at least 2013, pending further environmental review". <ref name=NYer01/> TransCanada stated they have been in conversation with the U.S. Department of State (DOS) and fourteen different routes were being studied, including eight impacting Nebraska. They included one potential alternative route in Nebraska that would have avoided the entire Sandhills region and [[Ogallala aquifer]] and six alternatives that would have reduced pipeline mileage crossing the Sandhills or the aquifer. <ref name="TransCanada-5893"/> .
