The majority of Brazilian population, in 2005, voted against banning the sale of guns and ammunition to civilians in a [[referendum]]. Voting was compulsory for people between the ages of 18 and 70. The belief of a fundamental natural right to self-defense, low efficacy of [[Policing in Brazil|police]], high levels of use of illegal weapons in crimes in contrast to a very rare usage of legal weapons, and increasing power of criminal organizations (like [[Primeiro Comando da Capital|PCC]]) are some factors that may have influenced 65% of Brazilian people to decide against the ban. The gun ban proposal received mixed support in the press, while celebrities were generally in favor, and drew the attention of international NGOs such as the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] and the [[IANSA]]. <ref name="NRA in Brazil"/> . 

== 2005 Referendum concerning the prohibition of the sale of firearms and ammunition ==. 
{{Main|Referendum concerning the prohibition of the sale of firearms and ammunition}} . 

In 2005, a [[referendum]] was held in Brazil in an attempt to forbid the sale of firearms and ammunition nationwide. According to the Brazilian constitution, every citizen has the right to self-defense and the pro-gun campaigners focused their arguments around this constitutional right, as well as making economic arguments.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} . 

A decisive argument made by the pro-gun campaigners was to question the morality of the government removing a right from its citizens, resulting in a strong feeling among voters that no rights should ever be allowed to be taken away by the government. <ref>http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u114537.shtml</ref> Also, there were debates about the significant cultural status of gun ownership in the southern states of the country.  . 

Another major argument used by the pro-gun ownership campaigners was the fact that the absolute majority of the gun crimes in Brazil were committed with unregistered and illegal guns, specially high caliber guns, that were already forbidden in Brazil and due to that, it would be of no use to forbid law-abiding citizens to own legal registered guns in accordance to the law. This argument was strongly reinforced by the fact that the regions where gun ownership is widespread were the ones with the smallest number of gun-related deaths. In the South region where there is the highest number of legal guns per citizen only 59% of all murders were caused by firearms in contrast to 70% in the Northeast where there is the lowest number of legal firearms per citizen. <ref>Urbim, Emiliano (2008). "Mapa da morte", Superinteressante, Nº 262, Pp 30 and 31. </ref> . 

The anti-gun proponents argued that guns are dangerous for society and that their only reason to exist is to harm others.  . 

The anti-gun campaign received widespread support from several famous actors, musicians and other Brazilian celebrities and a noticeable support from the nation's main TV station, [[Rede Globo]].  . 

The result of the referendum ended with a victory of those against the gun-ban, with over 63% of the voters opposed. <ref name="Gun rights in Brazil">{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,173154,00.html|title=Brazilians Block Gun Ban |author=Associated Press |date=October 23, 2005  |accessdate=2008-06-18 |publisher=Fox News}}</ref> Although the Brazilian Government, the Catholic Church, and the United Nations, argued in favor of a gun ban, it was argued successfully that guns are needed for personal security. <ref name="BBCNews"/> .

The ban also had the backing of the federal government (which wanted a government monopoly on gun possession), the Roman Catholic Church, and Rede Globo. <ref name=morton-gunning /> The anti-gun lobby received vast support and free coverage from the press.  .
