Policies at the [[Federal government of the United States|Federal]], state, and local levels have attempted to address gun violence through a variety of methods, including restricting firearms purchasing by youths and other "at-risk" populations, setting waiting periods for firearm purchases, establishing gun "buy-back" programs, targeted law enforcement and policing strategies, stiff sentencing of gun law violators, education programs for parents and children, and community-outreach programs. Research has found some policies such as gun "buy-back" programs are ineffective, while [[Boston]]'s [[Operation Ceasefire]], a gang violence abatement and intervention strategy, has been effective. <ref name="NAS-exec">

== Gun ownership ==. 
The [[General Social Survey]] (GSS) is a primary source for data on firearm ownership, with surveys periodically done by other organizations such as [[Harris Interactive]]. <ref>{{cite web |title=Gun Ownership: Two in Five Americans Live in Gun-Owning Households |url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=234 |accessdate=2006-11-08 |publisher=[[Harris Interactive]]}}</ref> In 2004, 36.5% of Americans reported having a gun in their home and in 1997, 40% of Americans reported having a gun in their homes. At this time there were approximately 44 million gun owners in the United States. This means that 25 percent of all adults owned at least one firearm. These owners possessed 192 million firearms, of which 65 million were handguns. <ref>P.J. Cook and J. Ludwig, Guns in America: Results of a Comprehensive National Survey on Firearms Ownership and Use, Summary Report, Washington, DC: Police Foundation, 1997. </ref> The number of American homes reporting have a gun in their homes is down from 46% as reported in 1989. <ref name="gss">{{cite web |url=http://gss.norc.org/ |title=GSS Cumulative Data Set (1972-2004) |author=General Social Survey}}</ref> Philip J. Cook suggests that increased numbers of female-headed households may be a factor in declining household ownership figures. <ref name="NAS-ch3"/> A National Survey on Private Ownership and Use of Firearms (NSPOF), conducted in 1994, indicates that Americans own 192 million guns, with 36% of these consisting of rifles, 34% handguns, 26% shotguns, and 4% of other types of long guns. <ref name="nspof">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/165476.pdf |title=National Survey on Private Ownership and Use of Firearms |date=May 1997 |publisher=[[National Institute of Justice]]}}</ref> Most firearm owners own multiple firearms, with the NSPOF survey indicating 25% of adults own firearms. <ref name="nspof"/> In the United States, 11% of households report actively being involved in [[hunting]],<ref name="gss"/> with the remaining firearm owners having guns for self-protection and other reasons. Throughout the 1970s and much of the 1980s, the rate of gun ownership in the home ranged from 45-50%. <ref name="gss"/> Gun ownership also varies across geographic regions, ranging from 25% rates of ownership in the [[Northeastern United States]] to 60% rates of ownership in the [[East South Central States]]. <ref name="azrael-2004">{{cite journal |title=State and Local Prevalence of Firearms Ownership Measurement, Structure, and Trends |author=Azrael, Deborah, Philip J.

=== Self-protection ===. 
Between 1987 and 1990, David McDowall found that guns were used in defense during a crime incident 64,615 times annually. <ref name="mcdowall">{{cite journal |title=The Incidence of Defensive Firearm Use by US Crime Victims, 1987 through 1990 |author=McDowall, David, Brian Wiersema |journal=[[American Journal of Public Health]] |year=1994 |volume=84 |pages=1982–1984 |pmid=7998641 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.84.12.1982 |issue=12 |pmc=1615397}}</ref> This equates to two times out of 1,000 incidents (0.2%) that occurred in this time frame. <ref name="mcdowall"/> For violent crimes ([[assault]], [[robbery]], and [[rape]]), guns were used 0.83% of the time in self-defense. <ref name="mcdowall"/> Of the times that guns were used in self-defense, 71% of the crimes were committed by strangers, with the rest of the incidents evenly divided between offenders that were acquaintances or persons well-known to the victim. <ref name="mcdowall"/> Of all incidents where a gun was used for self-defense, victims shot at the offender 28% of the time. <ref name="mcdowall"/> In 20% of the self-defense incidents, the guns were used by [[police officer]]s. <ref name="mcdowall"/> During this same time period, 1987 and 1990, there were 46,319 gun homicides,<ref>{{cite book |title=Uniform Crime Reports, 1987-1990 |publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]}}</ref> and the [[National Crime Victimization Survey]] estimates that 2,628,532 nonfatal crimes involving guns occurred. <ref name="mcdowall"/> . 

The findings of the McDowall's study for the ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]'' contrast with the findings of a 1993 study by [[Gary Kleck]], who finds that as many as 2.45 million crimes are thwarted each year in the United States, and in most cases, the potential victim never fires a shot in these cases where firearms are used constructively for self-protection. <ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite book |title=Guns, Crime, and Freedom |publisher=[[Regnery Publishing]] |author= LaPierre, Wayne |year=1994 |page=23 |isbn=0895264773}}</ref> The results of the Kleck studies have been cited many times in scholarly and popular media. <ref>{{cite journal |title=Firearms and the killing threshold (Letter) |author=Suter, E.A. |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]] |year=1992 |volume=326 |pages=1159 |pmid=1552925 |issue=17 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199204233261712 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=The value of civilian handgun possession as a deterrent to crime or a defense against crime |author=Kates, D.B. |journal=[[American Journal of Criminal Law]] |year=1991 |volume=18 |pages=113–167 |id={{NCJ|132948}}}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Go ahead, make our day |publisher=[[The New Republic]] |date=February 22, 1988 |pages=7–9}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Do guns save lives? |publisher=[[Time Magazine]] |date=August 12, 1988 |pages=25–26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Are we "a nation of cowards"? |publisher=[[Newsweek]] |date=November 15, 1993 |pages=93–94}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Hold your fire: gun control won't stop rising violence |author=Kopel, D.B. |publisher=Policy Review |year=1993 |volume=63 |pages=58–65 |id={{NCJ|153748}}}}</ref><ref name="medlit">{{cite web |url=http://teapot.usask.ca/cdn-firearms/Suter/med-lit.html |title=Guns in the Medical Literature - A Failure of Peer Review |author=Edgar A.

McDowall cites methodological issues with the Kleck studies, stating that Kleck used a very small [[sampling (statistics)|sample size]] and did not confine self-defense to attempted victimizations where physical attacks had already commenced. <ref name="mcdowall"/> The former criticism, however, is inaccurate — Kleck's survey with Marc Gertz in fact used the largest sample size of any survey that ever asked respondents about defensive gun use — 4,977 cases, far more than is typical in national surveys. <ref>

== Public policy ==. 
{{main|Gun politics in the United States}}
Public policy as related to preventing gun violence is an ongoing political and social debate regarding both the restriction and availability of firearms within the United States. Policy at the Federal level is/has been governed by the Second Amendment, National Firearms Act, Gun Control Act of 1968, Firearm Owners Protection Act, Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, and the Domestic Violence Offender Act. Gun policy in the United States has been revised many times with acts such as the Firearm Owners Protection Act, which loosened provisions for gun  sales while also strengthening automatic firearms law. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d099:HR04332: |title=Library of Congress Record |publisher=Library of Congress}}</ref>
Recently at the local and state level, gun laws such as handgun bans have been overturned by the Supreme Court in cases such as District of Columbia v. Heller and McDonald v. Chicago, these cases hold that an individual person has a right to possess a firearm for legitimate purposes, Columbia v. Heller only addressed the issue on Federal enclaves, while McDonald v Chicago addressed the issue as relating to the individual states. <ref>{{cite news | title = Justices to Decide if State Gun Laws Violate Rights | first = Robert | last = Barnes | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/30/AR2009093001723.html | newspaper = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 2009-10-01 |quote = the 5 to 4 opinion in District of Columbia v.

[[File:S&W 60 3in.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The most common type of gun confiscated by [[police]] and traced by the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] are [[.38 special]] revolvers, such as this Smith and Wesson Model 60 .38 Special revolver with a 3-inch barrel. <ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book |title=Guns, Crime, and Freedom |publisher=[[Regnery Publishing]] |author= LaPierre, Wayne |year=1994 |page=58 |isbn=0895264773}}</ref>]] . 

U.S. policy aims to maintain the right of legitimate users to own most types of firearms, while restricting access to firearms by those individuals in high risk groups. <ref name="cook2000-ch3"/> Gun dealers in the United States are prohibited from selling handguns to those under the age of 21, and [[long gun]]s to those under the age of 18. <ref name="cook2000-ch3"/> There are also restrictions on selling guns to out-of-state residents. <ref name="cook2000-ch3"/>  . 

Assuming access to guns, the top ten types of guns involved in crime in the U.S. show a definite trend in favoring handguns over long guns. The top ten guns used in crime, as reported by the ATF in 1993, included the [[Smith & Wesson]] .38 Special and .357 revolvers; [[Raven Arms MP-25|Raven Arms]] .25 caliber, [[Raven Arms MP-25|Davis]] P-380 .380 caliber, [[Ruger MK II|Ruger]] .22 caliber, [[Raven Arms MP-25|Lorcin]] L-380 .380 caliber, and Smith & Wesson semi-automatic handguns; [[Mossberg 500|Mossberg]] and [[Remington Arms|Remington]] 12 gauge shotguns; and the [[Intratec TEC-DC9|Tec DC-9]]. <ref name=autogenerated1 /> An earlier 1985 study of 1,800 incarcerated felons showed that criminals prefer revolvers and other non-semi-automatic firearms over semi-automatic firearms. <ref>{{cite book |title=ARMED AND CONSIDERED DANGEROUS: A Survey of Felons and their Firearms |publisher=[[Aldine de Gruyter]] |author= James D.

Federally licensed firearm dealers in the primary (new and used gun) market are regulated by the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives]] (ATF). Firearm manufacturers are required to put [[serial number]]s on all new firearms.

=== Federal legislation ===. 
{{main|Gun law in the United States}}
The first Federal legislation related to firearms was the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]], ratified in 1791. For 143 years, this was the only major Federal legislation regarding firearms. The next Federal firearm legislation was the [[National Firearms Act]] of 1934. This Act created regulations for the sale of firearms, established [[Excise tax in the United States|taxes]] on their sale, and required registration of some types of firearms such as [[machine gun]]s. <ref>{{cite book |author=Friedman, Lawrence M. |title=Crime and Punishment in American History |year=1993 |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |isbn=0-465-01461-5 |page=267}}</ref> . 

In the aftermath of the Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. assassinations, the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]] was enacted. This Act regulated gun commerce, restricting [[mail order]] sales, and allowing shipments only to licensed firearm dealers. The Act also prohibited [[felony|felons]], those under [[indictment]], [[fugitive]]s, [[Alien (law)|illegal aliens]], [[narcotics|drug]] users, those [[Military discharge|dishonorably discharged]] from the [[Military of the United States|military]], and those in [[Psychiatric hospital|mental institutions]] from owning guns. <ref name="cook2000-ch3"/> The law also restricted importation of [[Saturday night special]]s and other types of guns, and limited the sale of [[automatic weapon]]s and [[semi-automatic weapon]]s conversion kits. <ref name="rushefsky"/> . 

The [[Firearm Owners Protection Act]], also known as the McClure-Volkmer Act, was passed in 1986. It changed some restrictions in the 1968 Act, allowing federally-licensed gun dealers, as well as individual unlicensed private sellers, to sell at [[gun show]]s, while continuing to require licensed gun dealers to require background checks. <ref name="rushefsky"/> The 1986 Act also restricted the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms from conducting repetitive inspections, reduced the amount of recordkeeping required of gun dealers, raised the burden of proof for convicting gun law violators, and changed restrictions on convicted [[Felony|felons]] from owning firearms. <ref name="rushefsky"/> . 

In the years following the passage of the Gun Control Act of 1968, people buying guns were required to show [[Identity document|identification]] and sign a statement affirming that they were not in any of the prohibited categories. <ref name="cook2000-ch3"/> Many [[U.S. state|states]] enacted [[background check]] laws that went beyond the federal requirements. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Cook, Philip J., James Blose |title=State Programs for Screening Handgun Buyers |journal=[[Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]] |year=1981 |volume=May 1981 |pages=80–91 |id={{NCJ|79101}} |doi=10.1177/000271628145500108}}</ref> The [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act]] passed by [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] in 1993 imposed a waiting period before the purchase of a handgun, allowing a background check. <ref>The Brady Act did not require background checks, but mandates the waiting period so that background checks can be done.

The [[Domestic Violence Offender Gun Ban]], '' 'the Lautenberg Amendment' '', prohibited anyone previously convicted of a misdemeanor crime of [[domestic violence]] from owning a firearm. <ref>This was [[ex post facto]], in the opinion of then-representative [[Bob Barr]], [http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/judiciary/hju58106.000/hju58106_0f.htm] House of Representatives, Subcommittee on Crime, Committee on the Judiciary, March 5, 1997</ref> It also banned shipment, transport, ownership and use of guns or ammunition by individuals convicted of [[misdemeanor]] or [[felony]] domestic violence. This law also outlawed the sale or gift of a firearm or ammunition to such a person. It was passed in 1996, and became effective in 1997. Some opponents believe that the law conflicts with the [[right to arms|right to keep and bear arms]] protected by the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution]], and this law has modified the Second Amendment to a revocable privilege from a fundamental protection. Opponents of this law tend to describe the law by the name "''the Lautenberg Amendment.''" The law applies to everyone, including police officers and military personnel, and can cause difficulties by prohibiting active duty military and police from carrying guns, due to prior civilian misdemeanor convictions. <ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | title = Domestic Violence Offender Gun Ban Fact Sheet | work = | publisher = National Center for Women & Policing | date = | url = http://www.womenandpolicing.org/gunban.asp | format = [[Active Server Pages|asp]] | accessdate = 2007-02-05 }}</ref><!--we need a better source here--> . 

In the immediate aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]], police and National Guard units in New Orleans confiscated firearms from private citizens in an attempt to prevent violence.

=== State legislation ===. 
{{main|Gun (Firearm) laws in the United States (by state)}} . 

==== Right-to-carry ====. 
Right-to-carry laws expanded in the 1990s as homicide rates from gun violence in the United States increased, largely in response to incidents such as the [[Luby's massacre]] of 1991 in Texas which directly resulted in the passage of a ''[[carrying concealed weapon]],'' or ''CCW'', law in Texas in 1995. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chron.com/content/chronicle/nation/guns/part2/gunside1.html |work=[[San Antonio Express-News]] |title=Guns in America, Part II |accessdate=2006-11-15}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
As Rorie Sherman, staff reporter for the ''National Law Journal'' wrote in an article published on April 18, 1994, "It is a time of unparalleled desperation about crime. But the mood is decidedly 'I'll do it myself' and 'Don't get in my way.'"<ref>{{cite book |author= LaPierre, Wayne |title=Guns, Crime, and Freedom |publisher=[[Regnery Publishing]] |year=1994 |page=98 |isbn= 0895264773}}</ref>  . 

The result was laws that permitted persons to carry firearms openly, known as ''[[open carry]]'', often without any permit required, in 22 states by 1998. <ref>{{cite book |title=Boston on Guns & Courage |year=1998 |publisher=[[Javelin Press]] |author=Boston T. Party (Kenneth W.

Economist [[John Lott]] has argued that right-to-carry laws create a perception that more potential crime victims might be carrying firearms, and thus serve as a [[Deterrence (psychological)|deterrent]] against crime. <ref name="lott-1997">{{cite journal |author=Lott, Jr., John R., David B.

==== Child Access Prevention (CAP) ====. 
Child Access Prevention (CAP) laws, enacted by many states, require parents to store firearms safely, to minimize access by children to guns, while maintaining ease of access by adults. <ref name="NBER">{{cite book |author=DeSimone, Jeff, Sara Markowitz |chapter=The Effect of Child Access Prevention Laws on Non-Fatal Gun Injuries |title=NBER Working Paper No. 11613 |date=September 2005 |publisher=[[National Bureau of Economic Research]] |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/W11613}}</ref> CAP laws hold gun owners [[Legal liability|liable]] should a child gain access to a loaded gun that is not properly stored. <ref name="NBER"/>  Statistics from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] showed that, on average, one child died every three days in accidental incidents in the United States from 2000 to 2005. <ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Boy finds forgotten gun, accidentally shoots self in head |url= |quote=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/US/04/21/forgotten.gun/index.html?eref=edition |work=[[CNN]] |date=April 21, 2009 |accessdate=2009-04-22 }}</ref>  In most states, CAP law violations are considered [[misdemeanor]]s. <ref name="NBER"/> [[Florida]]'s CAP law, enacted in 1989, permits [[felony]] prosecution of violators. <ref name="NBER"/> Research indicates that CAP laws are correlated with a reduction in unintentional gun deaths by 23%,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cummings, Peter, David C.

=== Local restrictions ===. 
Some local jurisdictions in the United States have more restrictive laws, such as [[Washington, D.C.]]'s [[Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975]], which banned residents from owning handguns, and required permitted firearms be disassembled and locked with a trigger lock. On March 9, 2007, a [[Parker v. District of Columbia|U.S. Appeals Court]] ruled the Washington, D.C. handgun ban unconstitutional. <ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=azTOCL.ZiDGM&refer=us ''"Federal Appeals Court Strikes Down D.C. Handgun Ban"''] Bloomberg News, March 9, 2007</ref> The appeal of that case later led to the [[Supreme Court]]'s ruling in [[District of Columbia v. Heller]] that D.C.'s ban was unconstitutional under the [[Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|Second Amendment]].  . 

[[New York City]] is also known for its strict gun control laws. Despite local laws, guns are often trafficked into cities from other parts of the United States, particularly the southern states. <ref name="butterfield"/><ref>{{cite book |author=Wintemute, Garen |chapter=Guns and Gun Violence |title=The Crime Drop in America |editor=Blumstein, Alfred, Joel Wallman |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2000}}</ref> Results from the ATF's Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative indicate that the percentage of imported guns involved in crimes is tied to the stringency of local firearm laws. <ref name="ycgii"/> . 

== Prevention programs ==. 
Violence prevention and [[educational program]]s have been established in many [[school]]s and communities across the United States. These programs aim to change personal behavior of both [[children]] and their [[parent]]s, encouraging children to stay away from guns, ensure parents store guns safely, and encourage children to [[dispute resolution|solve disputes]] without resorting to violence. <ref name="hardy">{{cite journal |author=Hardy, Marjorie S. |title=Behavior-Oriented Approaches to Reducing Gun Violence |journal=[[The Future of Children]] |publisher=[[Woodrow Wilson School]] / [[The Brookings Institution]] |year=2002 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=101–118 |id={{NCJ|196785}}}}</ref> Programs aimed at altering [[behavior]] range from passive (requiring no effort on part of the individual) to active (supervising children, or placing a [[trigger lock]] on a gun). <ref name="hardy"/> The more effort required of people, the more difficult it is to implement a [[Crime prevention|prevention]] strategy. <ref>{{cite book |author=Christophersen, E.R. |chapter=Improving compliance in childhood injury control |title=Developmental aspects of health compliance behavior |publisher=[[Lawrence Erlbaum Associates]] |year=1993 |pages=219–231}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Williams, A.F. |title=Passive and active measures for controlling disease and injury |journal=[[Health Psychology]] |year=1982 |volume=1 |pages=399–409 |pmid=11586556 |doi=10.1037/h0090242 |last2=Farrell |first2=RJ |last3=Kelly |first3=CP |issue=3}}</ref> Prevention strategies focused on modifying the situational environment and the firearm itself may be more effective. <ref name="hardy"/> Empirical [[evaluation]] of gun violence prevention programs has been limited. <ref name="NAS-exec"/> Of the evaluations that have been done, results indicate such programs have minimal effectiveness. <ref name="hardy"/> . 

=== The 1-866-SPEAK-UP  Hotline ===. 
SPEAK UP is a national youth violence prevention initiative created by [[The Center to Prevent Youth Violence]],<ref>{{cite web|title=The Center to Prevent Youth Violence|url=http://www.cpyv.org|accessdate=29 August 2011}}</ref> which provides young people with tools to improve the safety of their schools and communities. The SPEAK UP program features the first-ever, anonymous, national hot-line for young people to report threats of violence in their communities or at school. The [[1-866-SPEAK-UP]] hot-line is the only national hot-line for students to anonymously report weapon threats 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week.  The hot-line is operated in accordance with a rigid protocol developed in collaboration with national education and law enforcement authorities, including the FBI.  Trained counselors, with instant access to translators for 140 languages, collect information from callers and then immediately report the threat to appropriate school and law enforcement officials. The counselors also have access to an extensive database of local, city, and state referral sources, which they can offer callers who call with issues unrelated to youth violence.  Since its launch in 2002, the hotline has received over 38,000 calls from youth nationwide. <ref>http://www.paxusa.org/speakup/about.html</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpyv.org/programs/what-is-speak-up/|title=What is SPEAK UP?|accessdate=29 August 2011}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> . 

=== Gun safety parent counseling ===. 
One of the most widely used parent counseling programs is Steps to Prevent Firearm Injury program (STOP), which was developed in 1994 by the [[Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence]]. <ref name="hardy"/> STOP was superseded by STOP 2 in 1998, which has a broader focus including more communities and health care providers. <ref name="hardy"/> STOP has been evaluated and found not to have a significant effect on gun ownership or firearm storage practices by inner-city parents. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Oatis, Pamela J., Nancy M. Fenn Buderer, Peter Cummings, Rosemarie Fleitz |title=Pediatric practice based evaluation of the Steps to Prevent Firearm Injury program |journal=[[Injury Prevention]] |volume=5 |issue=1 |year=1999 |pages=48–52 |pmid=10323570 |doi=10.1136/ip.5.1.48 |pmc=1730460}}</ref> Marjorie S. Hardy suggests further evaluation of STOP is needed, as this evaluation had a limited sample size and lacked a control group. <ref name="hardy"/> . 

=== Children ===. 
Prevention programs geared towards children have also not been greatly successful. <ref name="hardy"/> Many inherent challenges arise when working with children, including their tendency to perceive themselves as invulnerable to injury,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Benthin, A., P. Slovic, H. Severan |title=A psychometric study of adolescent risk perception |journal=[[Journal of Adolescence]] |year=1993 |volume=16 |pages=153–168 |doi=10.1006/jado.1993.1014 |pmid=8376640 |issue=2}}</ref> limited ability to apply lessons learned,<ref name="hyson">{{cite journal |author=Hyson, M.C., G.G.

The goal of gun safety programs, usually administered by local firearms dealers and shooting clubs, is to teach older children and adolescents how to handle firearms safely. <ref name="hardy"/> There has been no systematic evaluation of the effect of these programs on children. <ref name="hardy"/> For adults, no positive effect on gun storage practices has been found as a result of these programs. <ref>{{cite conference |author=Cook, P.J., J. Ludwig |title=Guns in America: National survey on private ownership and use of firearms |booktitle=Research in Brief |publisher=[[National Institute of Justice]] |date=May 1997 |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/165476.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hemenway, D., S.

Baker, S.P. Teret, ''et al.'' |title=Saving children: A guide to injury prevention |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1991}}</ref> . 

One approach taken is gun avoidance, such as when encountering a firearm at a neighbor's home. The [[Eddie Eagle]] Gun Safety Program, administered by the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA), is geared towards younger children from pre-[[kindergarten]] to sixth grade, and teaches kids that real guns are not toys by emphasizing a "just say no" approach. <ref name="hardy"/> The Eddie Eagle program is based on training children in a four-step action to take when they see a firearm: (1) Stop! (2) Don't touch! (3) Leave the area. (4) Go tell an adult. Materials, such as coloring books and posters, back the lessons up and provide the repetition necessary in any child-education program. The ineffectiveness of the "just say no" approach promoted by the NRA's Eddie the Eagle program was highlighted in an investigative piece by ABC's Diane Sawyer in 1999.[http://abcnews.go.com/video/playerIndex?id=7282623] Sawyer's piece was based on academic studies conducted by Dr. Marjorie Hardy, assistant professor of psychology at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania. [http://www.parents.com/kids/teens/violence/is-there-a-gun-in-the-house/?page=3] Dr. Hardy's study tracked the behavior of elementary age schoolchildren who spent a day learning the Eddie the Eagle four-step action plan from a uniformed police officer. The children were then placed into a playroom which contained a hidden gun. When the children found the gun, they did not run away from the gun, but rather, they inevitably played with it, pulled the trigger while looking into the barrel, or aimed the gun at a playmate and pulled the trigger. The study concluded that children's natural curiosity was far more powerful than the parental admonition to "Just say no". [http://ceep.crc.uiuc.edu/pubs/ivpaguide/appendix/patten-sayingno.pdf] . 

Some [[gun control]] advocacy groups have developed their own programs, such as Straight Talk about Risks (STAR), administered by the [[Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence]], and Hands without Guns, run by the Joshua Horwitz Educational Fund to End Handgun Violence. <ref name="hardy"/> . 

=== Community programs ===. 
Programs targeted at entire [[community|communities]], such as community revitalization, after-school programs, and [[Public service announcement|media campaigns]], may be more effective in reducing the general level of violence that children are exposed to. <ref>{{cite journal |author=[[Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry]], Committee on Preventative Psychiatry |title=Violent behavior in children and youth: Preventative intervention from a psychiatric perspective |journal=[[Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry]] |year=1999 |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=235–241 |doi=10.1097/00004583-199903000-00008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Arrendondo, S., T.

== Intervention programs ==. 
[[Sociology|Sociologist]] James D. Wright suggests that to convince inner-city youths not to carry guns "requires convincing them that they can survive in their neighborhood without being armed, that they can come and go in peace, that being unarmed will not cause them to be victimized, intimidated, or slain."<ref name="wright"/> Intervention programs, such as [[CeaseFire (organization)|CeaseFire Chicago]], [[Operation Ceasefire]] in [[Boston]] and [[Project Exile]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]] during the 1990s, have been shown to be effective. <ref name="NAS-exec"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Braga, Anthony A., David M.

"Gun Bounty" programs launched in several Florida cities have shown more promise.  These programs involve cash rewards for anonymous tips about illegal weapons that leads to an arrest and a weapons charge. Since its inception May 2007, the Miami program led to 264 arrests, confiscation of 432 guns owned illegally and $2.2 million in drugs, as well as solved several murder and burglary cases. <ref>{{cite news|title=County Gun Buy Back Program Touted as a Success|url=http://cbs4.com/local/gun.bounty.program.2.1718353.html  | accessdate=June 1, 2010 | date=2010-05-26}}</ref> . 

=== Operation Ceasefire ===. 
In 1995, [[Operation Ceasefire]] was established as a strategy for stemming the epidemic of youth gun violence in Boston. Violence was particularly concentrated in poor, inner-city neighborhoods including [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]], [[Dorchester, Massachusetts|Dorchester]], and [[Mattapan]]. <ref name="kennedy">{{cite book |author=Kennedy, David M., Anthony A.

=== Project Exile ===. 
[[File:Psnlogo.jpg|thumb|right|120|Federally-supported gun violence intervention program]]
[[Project Exile]], conducted in Richmond, Virginia during the 1990s, was a coordinated effort involving federal, state, and local officials that targeted gun violence. The strategy entailed [[prosecution]] of gun violations in Federal courts, where [[sentencing guidelines]] were tougher. Project Exile also involved outreach and education efforts through media campaigns, getting the message out about the crackdown. <ref name="raphael">{{cite book |author=Raphael, Stephen, Jens Ludwig |chapter=Prison Sentence Enhancements: The Case of Project Exile |title=Evaluating Gun Policy: Effects on Crime and Violence |editor=Ludwig, Jens, Philip I.

=== Project Safe Neighborhoods ===. 
[[Project Safe Neighborhoods]] (PSN) is a national strategy for reducing gun violence that builds on the strategies implemented in Operation Ceasefire and [[Project Exile]]. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/BJA/html/PSNFactS.pdf |title=Project Safe Neighborhoods - Fact Sheet |author=U.S. Department of Justice |date=May 13, 2003}}</ref> PSN was established in 2001, with support from the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]], channelled through the [[United States Attorney|United States Attorney's Offices]] in the [[United States Department of Justice]]. The [[Federal government of the United States|Federal government]] has spent over [[United States dollar|US$]]1.5 billion since the program's inception on the hiring of [[prosecutor]]s, and providing assistance to state and local jurisdictions in support of training and community outreach efforts. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psn.gov/about/faqs.html |title=Project Safe Neighborhoods: FAQs |publisher=[[U.S. Department of Justice]]}}</ref><ref name="NAS-ch9">{{cite book |title=Firearms and Violence: A Critical Review |year=2004 |publisher=[[National Academy of Science]] |author=Committee on Law and Justice |chapter=Chapter 9 |isbn=0309091241}}</ref> . 

== Research limitations ==. 
In the United States, [[research]] into firearms and violent crime is fraught with difficulties, associated with limited [[data]] on gun ownership and use,<ref name="azrael-2004"/> firearms markets, and aggregation of crime data. <ref name="NAS-exec"/> Research studies into gun violence have primarily taken one of two approaches: [[case-control]] studies and [[social ecology]]. <ref name="NAS-exec"/> Gun ownership is usually determined through [[statistical survey|surveys]], [[Proxy (statistics)|proxy]] variables, and sometimes with [[Mass production|production]] and [[import]] figures. In statistical analysis of homicides and other types of crime which are rare events, these data tend to have [[poisson distribution]]s, which also presents methodological challenges to researchers. With data aggregation, it is difficult to make inferences about individual behavior. <ref name="NAS-ch1">{{cite book |title=Firearms and Violence: A Critical Review |year=2004 |publisher=[[National Academy of Science]] |author=Committee on Law and Justice |chapter=Chapter 1 |url=http://www.nap.edu/books/0309091241/html/11.html |isbn=0309091241}}</ref> This problem, known as [[ecological fallacy]], is not always handled properly by researchers, leading some to jump to conclusions that their data do not necessarily support. <ref name="NAS-ch2">{{cite book |title=Firearms and Violence: A Critical Review |year=2004 |publisher=[[National Academy of Science]] |author=Committee on Law and Justice |chapter=Chapter 2 |url=http://www.nap.edu/books/0309091241/html/19.html |isbn=0309091241}}</ref> .
