{{Gun politics by country}}
'''Gun control''' is any law, policy, practice, or proposal designed to restrict or limit the possession, production, importation, shipment, sale, and/or use of [[gun]]s or other firearms by private citizens. Most commonly the guns in question are personal [[firearm]]s, typically [[handgun]]s and [[long gun]]s.  . 

Gun control laws and policies vary greatly around the world with some countries, such as [[China]], having very strict limits on gun possession and others, such as the [[United States]], having relatively modest limits. In some countries, the topic remains a source of intense debate with proponents generally arguing the dangers of widespread gun ownership, and opponents generally arguing individual rights of self-protection as well as individual liberties in general.  . 

==Arguments==.

Several studies have examined the [[statistical correlation|correlations]] between rates of gun ownership and gun-related, as well as overall, homicide and suicide rates within various jurisdictions around the world. <ref name="go19">''[http://www.unicri.it/wwk/publications/books/series/understanding/19_GUN_OWNERSHIP.pdf Gun Ownership, Suicide and Homicide: An International Perspective]''{{dead link|date=June 2011}}, Martin Killias. </ref><ref>''[http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/27/2/214.pdf Firearm-related deaths in the United States and 35 other high- and upper-middle income countries]'', EG Krug, KE Powell and LL Dahlberg, 1998. </ref> Martin Killias, in a 1993 study covering 21 countries, found that there were significant correlations between gun ownership and gun-related suicide and homicide rates. There was also a significant though lesser correlation between gun ownership and total homicide rates. <ref>{{cite web

Strong correlations were found between gun ownership and gun-related as well as total suicide, but that the overall rate of suicide using firearms is low, and homicide rates. Widespread gun ownership has not been found to reduce the likelihood of fatal events committed with other means. Thus, people do not turn to knives and other potentially lethal instruments less often when more guns are available,
|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080107174528/http://www.unicri.it/wwk/publications/books/series/understanding/19_GUN_OWNERSHIP.pdf |archivedate = January 7, 2008}}</ref> A later study published by Killias in 2001 reported that, while there was a strong correlation between gun-related homicide of women and gun-related assaults against women, this was not the case for similar crimes against men and that "interestingly, no significant correlations with total suicide or homicide rates were found, leaving open the question of possible substitution effects."<ref name=killias2001>Killias, van Kesteren, and Rindlisbacher, "Guns, violent crime, and suicide in 21 countries"''Canadian Journal of Criminology'', October 2001, http://rechten.uvt.nl/icvs/pdffiles/Guns_Killias_vanKesteren.pdf. </ref> This study indicates correlation, but not causality. This could mean that the easier the access to guns leads to more violence. It could also mean that larger amounts of violence lead to a higher level of gun ownership for self defense, or any other independent cause.  . 

A study by Rich et al. on suicide rates in [[Toronto]] and [[Ontario]] and psychiatric patients from [[San Diego]] reached the conclusion that increased gun restrictions, while reducing suicide-by-gun, resulted in no net decline in suicides, because of substitution of another method—namely leaping. <ref>[http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/147/3/342 Rich, et al.: "Guns and suicide: possible effects of some specific legislation" Am J Psychiatry 1990; 147:342-346]. </ref> Killias argues against the theory of complete substitution, citing a number of studies that have indicated, in his view "rather convincingly", that suicidal candidates far from always turn to another means of suicide if their preferred means is not at hand. <ref name=killias2001/> . 

===Resisting governance===. 
Advocates for gun rights often claim that past [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes passed gun control legislation, which was later followed by confiscation, with [[Fascism|Fascist]] [[Italy]] and [[Nazi]] Germany during [[World War II]], as well as some [[communist state]]s being cited as examples. <ref>Rummel,RJ, Death by Government (1994) Transaction Publishers, New Jersey, ISBN 1-56000-145-3. </ref><ref>Simkin, J, Zelman, and Rice, A, Lethal Laws: Gun Control is the Key to Genocide-- Documentary Proof that Enforcement of Gun Control Laws Clears the way for Governments to Commit Genocide, Jews for the Preservation of Firearm Ownership, Inc.,1994, ISBN 0-9642304-0-2. </ref><ref>Courtois,S, Werth, N, Panne, J-L, et al., The Black Book of Communism--Crimes, Terror, Repression(1999), Harvard University Press, Cambridge Massachusetts, ISBN 0-674-07608-7. </ref> Location and capture of firearms registration records has also long been a standard doctrine taught to military intelligence officers, and was widely practiced by German and Soviet troops during World War II in the countries they invaded. <ref name=simkin/><ref name = "Rummel-p111"/> . 

The [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]], sometimes known as the [[Shot heard 'round the world]], in 1775, were started in part because [[Thomas Gage|General Gage]] sought to carry out an order by the British government to disarm the populace. <ref>Kopel, David B. The Samurai, the Mountie, and the Cowboy--Should America Adopt the Gun Controls of Other Democracies? (1992), Prometheus Books, New York, pp. 313,351, ISBN 0-87975-756-6. </ref> . 

Gun control opponents often cite the example of the Nazi regime, claiming that once the Nazis had taken and consolidated their power, they proceeded to implement gun control laws to disarm the population and wipe out the opposition, and the genocide of disarmed Jews, gypsies, and other "undesirables" followed. <ref name=simkin>Simkin, J, Zelman, and Rice, A, Lethal Laws: Gun Control is the Key to Genocide-- Documentary Proof that Enforcement of Gun Control Laws Clears the way for Governments to Commit Genocide, Jews for the Preservation of Firearm Ownership, Inc.,1994, pp. 149-186, ISBN 0-9642304-0-2. </ref><ref name = "Rummel-p111">Rummel,RJ, Death by Government (1994) Transaction Publishers, New Jersey, pp. 111-122, ISBN 1-56000-145-3. </ref><ref name=halbrook>Halbrook, Stephen P.

No. 3. p. 528. </ref> Historians have pointed out that the preceding democratic [[Weimar Republic]] already had restrictive gun laws, which were actually liberalised by the Nazis when they came to power. According to the Weimar Republic 1928 ''Law on Firearms & Ammunition'', firearms acquisition or carrying permits were “only to be granted to persons of undoubted reliability, and—in the case of a firearms carry permit—only if a demonstration of need is set forth.” The Nazis replaced this law with the ''Weapons Law'' of March 18, 1938, which was very similar in structure and wording, but relaxed gun control requirements for the general population. This relaxation included the exemption from regulation of all weapons and ammunition except [[handguns]], the extension of the range of persons exempt from the permit requirement, and the lowering of the age for acquisition of firearms from 20 to 18. It did, however, prohibit manufacturing of firearms and ammunition by [[Jews]]. <ref name=harcourt>Harcourt, Bernard E (2004) [http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/harcourt/harcourt_fordham.pdf "On the NRA, Adolph Hitler, Gun Registration, and the Nazi Gun Laws: Exploring the Culture Wars (A Call to Historians)"], p. 22. </ref> Shortly thereafter, in the additional ''Regulations Against Jews' Possession of Weapons'' of November 11, 1938, Jews were forbidden from possession of any weapons at all. <ref name=halbrook/><ref name=harcourt/> . 

[[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] and the [[Soviet Union]] did not abolish personal gun ownership during the initial period from 1918 to 1929, and the introduction of gun control in 1929 coincided with the beginning of the repressive [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] regime as part of Resolutions, 1918 Decree, July 12, 1920 Art. 59 & 182, Pen. code, 1926.  . 

The population of Iraq was well armed while [[Saddam Hussein]] was in power, and this failed to oust him from power. A caveat to this being that gun ownership was restricted to [[Sunni Muslims]] who were part of tribes allied to Saddam, and that [[Shiite Muslims]], [[Iraqi Kurds]], [[Iraqi Christians]] were kept disarmed. [[Iraqi Jews]] were completely removed from [[Iraq]] when Saddam was in power, and were likewise disarmed. Widespread gun ownership in Iraq was a cause of concern to American military planners prior to the invasion of the country.  . 

===Self-defense===. 
{{Globalize/USA|article|2name=the United States|date=April 2010|discuss=Talk:Gun_politics#Globalize}}
In an extensive series of studies of large, nationally representative samples of crime incidents, criminologist [[Gary Kleck]] found that crime victims who defend themselves with guns are less likely to be injured or lose property than victims who either did not resist, or resisted without guns.  This was so, even though the victims using guns typically faced more dangerous circumstances than other victims.  The findings applied to both robberies and assaults. <ref>Kleck "Crime control through the use of armed force." ''Social Problems'' Feb. 1988; Kleck and DeLone "Victim resistance and offender weapon effects in robbery" ''Journal of Quantitative Criminology'' March 1993; Tark and Kleck "Resisting Crime" ''Criminology'' November 2004. </ref> Other research on rape indicated that although victims rarely resisted with guns, those using other weapons were less likely to be raped, and no more likely to suffer other injuries besides rape itself, than victims who did not resist, or resisted without weapons. <ref>Kleck and Sayles "Rape and Resistance" ''Social Problems'' May 1990. </ref> There is no evidence that victim use of a gun for self-protection provokes offenders into attacking the victim or results in the offender taking the gun away and using it against the victim. <ref>Kleck, Chapter 7 in ''Armed'', by Kleck and Don B. Kates, Jr. </ref>  . 

Kleck has also shown, in his own national survey, and in other surveys with smaller sample sizes, that the numbers of defensive uses of guns by crime victims each year are probably substantially larger than the largest estimates of the number of crimes committed of offenders using guns. <ref>Kleck, Chapter 6 in ''Armed'', by Kleck and Don B. Kates, Jr. </ref> According to Kleck, defensive gun use by victims is both effective and, relative to criminal uses, frequent. In a largely approving review of Kleck's book ''Point Blank'' (1991) in the journal ''Political Psychology'', Joseph F. Sheley argues that Kleck sidesteps the larger political problem of the role of gun culture in contributing to the spread and effect of violence in the United States. <ref>Review, ''Political Psychology'' 17:2 (Jun., 1996), pp. 375-377. </ref> . 

The economist [[John Lott]], in his book [[More Guns, Less Crime]], states that laws which make it easier for law-abiding citizens to get a permit to carry a gun in public places, cause reductions in crime. Lott's results suggest that allowing law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms deters crime because potential criminals do not know who may or may not be carrying a firearm.  Lott's data came from the FBI's crime statistics from all 3,054 US counties. <ref name = "Lott0p50">Lott, John R.Jr., More Guns, Less Crime-- Understanding Crime and Gun Control Laws(1998), The University of Chicago Press, Chicago Illinois, pp. 50-122, ISBN 0-226-49363-6. </ref> . 

Critics have asserted that Lott's county-based crime data were largely meaningless because they did not reflect actual rates of crime in all the counties that Lott studied, but rather the number of crimes occurring in whatever local jurisdictions (towns and cities) that happened to report their crime statistics to state authorities.  Thus, some of the supposed crime drops that Lott attributed to the new carry laws could merely have been the result of fewer local police forces reporting crime statistics. Lott answered their assertions by publishing his study and noting that this fact was taken into account by using the same police agencies that reported their statistics both before and after the new concealed carry laws took effect.  . 

The efficacy of gun control legislation at reducing the availability of guns has been challenged by, among others, the testimony of criminals that they do not obey gun control laws, and by the lack of evidence of any efficacy of such laws in reducing violent crime. The most thorough analysis of the impact of gun control laws, by Kleck, covered 18 major types of gun control and every major type of violent crime or violence (including suicide), and found that gun laws generally had no significant effect on violent crime rates or suicide rates. <ref>Kleck and Patterson, ''Journal of Quantitative criminology'' September 1993. </ref> In his paper, ''Understanding Why Crime Fell in the 1990s: Four Factors that Explain the Decline and Six that Do not'',<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://dss.ucsd.edu/~sscroggi/Econ1/LevittCrimeInThe90s18JEP163_2004.pdf |title=Understanding Why Crime Fell in the 1990s: Four Factors that Explain the Decline and Six that Do Not|first=Steven D |last=Levitt|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=18 |issue=1|year= 2004|format=}} {{Dead link|date=June 2010}}</ref> [[University of Chicago]] economist [[Steven Levitt]] argues that available data indicate that neither stricter gun control laws nor more liberal concealed carry laws have had any significant effect on the decline in crime in the 1990s. While the debate remains hotly disputed, it is therefore not surprising that a comprehensive review of published studies of gun control, released in November 2004 by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], was unable to determine any reliable statistically significant effect resulting from such laws, although the authors suggest that further study may provide more conclusive information.  . 

Thirty-nine [[U.S. state]]s have passed "[[Concealed carry in the United States#Shall-Issue|shall issue]]" concealed carry legislation of one form or another. In these states, law-abiding citizens (usually after giving evidence of completing a training course) may carry handguns on their person for self-protection. Other states and some cities such as [[New York]] [[Concealed carry in the United States#May-Issue|may issue]] permits. Only [[Illinois]], and the [[District of Columbia]] have explicit legislation forbidding personal carry. [[Vermont]], [[Arizona]], and [[Alaska]] do not require permits to carry concealed weapons, although Alaska retains a shall-issue permit process for reciprocity purposes with other states. Similarly, Arizona retains a shall-issue permit process,<ref>Arizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S.) §13-3112(A)</ref> both for reciprocity purposes and because permit holders are allowed to carry concealed handguns in certain places (such as bars and restaurants that serve alcohol) that non-permit holders are not. <ref>A.R.S. §4-229(A)</ref> . 

Many supporters of gun-rights consider [[Self-defense (theory)|self-defense]] to be a fundamental and [[Natural rights|inalienable]] [[human right]] and believe that firearms are an important tool in the exercise of this right. They consider the prohibition of an effective means of self defense to be [[Ethics|unethical]]. 
For instance, in [[Thomas Jefferson]]’s "Commonplace Book," a quote from [[Cesare Beccaria]] reads, "laws that forbid the carrying of arms ... disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes ... Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man."<ref name="Story 1986 pp. 319-320">Story,Joseph, A Familiar Exposition of the Constitution of the United States(1986) Regnery Gateway, Chicago, Illinois, pp. 319-320, ISBN 0-89526-796-9. </ref><ref>Hardy, David T.

===Domestic violence===. 
Gun control advocates claim that the strongest evidence linking availability of guns to [[injury]] and [[mortality rate]]s comes in studies of [[domestic violence]], most often referring to the series of studies by [[Arthur Kellermann]]. In response to public suggestions by some advocates of firearms for home defense, that homeowners were at high risk of injury from [[home invasion]]s and would be wise to acquire a firearm for purposes of protection, Kellermann investigated the circumstances surrounding all in-home homicides in three cities of about half a million population each over five years, and found that the risk of a homicide was in fact slightly higher in homes where a handgun was present, rather than lower. From the details of the homicides he concluded that the risk of a [[crime of passion]] or other domestic dispute ending in a fatal injury was much higher when a gun was readily available (essentially all the increased risk being in homes where a handgun was kept loaded and unlocked), compared to a lower rate of fatality in domestic violence not involving a firearm. 
This increase in mortality, he postulated, was large enough to overwhelm any protective effect the presence of a gun might have by deterring or defending against burglaries or home invasions, which occurred much less frequently. The increased risk averaged over all homes containing guns was similar in size to that correlated with an individual with a criminal record living in the home, but substantially less than that associated with demographic factors known to be risks for violence, such as renting a home versus ownership, or living alone versus with others. <ref>Kellermann AL, Rivara FP, Rushforth NB, et al. Gun ownership as a risk factor for homicide in the home. N Engl J Med 1993;329(15):1084-1091. </ref> . 

Critics of Kellermann's work and its use by advocates of gun control point out that since it deliberately ignores crimes of violence occurring outside the home (Kellermann states at the outset that the characteristics of such homicides are much more complex and ambiguous, and would be virtually impossible to classify rigorously enough), it is more directly a study of domestic violence than of gun ownership. Kellermann does in fact include in the conclusion of his 1993 paper several paragraphs referring to the need for further study of domestic violence and its causes and prevention. Researchers John Lott, Gary Kleck and many others dispute Kellermann's work. <ref>Suter, Edgar A, Guns in the Medical Literature-- A Failure of Peer Review, Journal of the Medical Association of Georgia;83:133-152, March, 1994. url =http://rkba.org/research/suter/med-lit.html</ref><ref>Kates DB, Schaffer HE, Lattimer JK, Murray GB, Cassem EH.

Kleck showed that no more than a handful of the homicides that Kellermann studied were committed with guns belonging to the victim or members of his or her household, and thus it was implausible that victim household gun ownership contributed to their homicide. Instead, the association that Kellermann found between gun ownership and victimization merely reflected the widely accepted notion that people who live in more dangerous circumstances are more likely to be murdered, but also were more likely to have acquired guns for self-protection prior to their death. <ref>Kleck, ''Homicide Studies'', February 2001. </ref> Kleck and others argue that guns being used to protect property, save lives, and deter crime without killing the criminal accounts for the large majority of defensive gun uses. <ref>Suter E, Waters WC, Murray GB, et al.

===Armed forces' reserves and reservist training===. 
In several countries, such as in [[Finland]], firearm politics and gun control are directly linked on the armed forces' reserves and reservist training. This is especially true in countries which base their armies on [[conscription]]; since every able-bodied citizen is basically a soldier, they are expected to be able to handle the gun reasonably, and be able to practice for the time of need.  . 

[[Switzerland]] is a noted example of a country in which, due to the country's conscription and [[militia]] traditions, firearm possession is widespread. Owing to Switzerland's history, all able-bodied male Swiss citizens aged between 21 and 50 (55 for [[officer (military)|officers]]) are issued [[assault rifle]]s and [[ammunition]] in order to perform their annual military obligations. Because of this, Switzerland is one of the few nations in the world with a higher rate of firearm possession than the United States. <ref name="g">[http://www.guncite.com/swissgun-kopel.html "What America can learn from Switzerland is that the best way to reduce gun misuse is to promote responsible gun ownership."], ''American Rifleman'', February 1990. </ref> Also, Switzerland has a relatively low rate of [[gun crime]]. <ref name="g"/> The comparatively low level of violent crime, despite the liberal gun laws, is demonstrated by the fact that Swiss politicians rarely have the same level of [[police]] protection as their counterparts in the United States and other countries, as was noted following the fatal shooting of several government officials in the Swiss [[cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Zug]] in September 2001. <ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/09/27/switzerland.shooting/ 'Grudge' behind Swiss gun massacre], CNN, September 2001. </ref> Some authors argue that Switzerland's militia tradition of "every man a soldier" contributed to the preservation of its [[neutral country|neutrality]] during the [[Second World War]], when it was not invaded by [[Nazi Germany]] because the military cost to the Nazis would have been too high. <ref>Poe, Richard, ''The Seven Myths of Gun Control'', Prima Publishing,  California, 2001, pp. 75-83, ISBN 0-7615-2558-0. </ref><ref>Kopel, David B., ed., ''Guns-- Who Should Have Them?'', New York, NY, Prometheus Books, 1995, pp. 42-43. </ref><ref>Kopel, David B., ''The Samurai, The Mountie and The Cowboy--Should America Adopt the Gun Control Laws of other Democracies?'', Prometheus Books, New York, 1992, pp. 278-302, ISBN 0-87975-756-6. </ref> However, this claim has been disputed by historians who cite the existence of detailed [[Operation Tannenbaum|invasion plans]], which rated the overall Swiss defense capacity as low. <ref>Urner, Klaus ''Die Schweiz muss noch geschluckt werden'', [[Zurich]], Verlag Neue Zürcher Zeitung, 1990, ISBN 3-85823-303-X. </ref><ref>Schelbert, Leo ''Switzerland under siege''; [[Rockport, Maine]]; Picton, 2000, ISBN 0-89725-414-7. </ref> . 

===Civil rights===. 
Some see gun ownership as a civil right.  This view is common in the United States where the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution]] guarantees the right of citizens to keep and bear arms. The Fourteenth Amendment protects gun owners when it states, "No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States..."<ref>{{cite web|title=14th Amendment|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv|publisher=Cornell.edu}}</ref>   This view is less common throughout the rest of the world.  . 

Jeff Snyder is a spokesman for the view that gun possession is a civil right, and that therefore arguments about whether gun restrictions reduce or increase violent crime are beside the point: "I am not here engaged in...recommending...policy prescriptions on the basis of the promised or probable results [on crime]...Thus these essays are not fundamentally about guns at all. They are, foremost, about...the kind of people we intend to be...and the ethical and political consequences of decisions [to control firearms]."<ref>Snyder, J: Nation of Cowards: Essays on the Ethics of Gun Control. Accurate Press, St. Louis, 2001:pp. i-ii. </ref> He terms the main principle behind gun control "the instrumental theory of salvation:" that, lacking the ability to change the violent intent in criminals, we often shift focus to the instrument in an attempt to "limit our ability to hurt ourselves, and one another."<ref>Snyder, J: Nation of Cowards: Essays on the Ethics of Gun Control. 2001, Accurate Press, St. Louis, p. 1. </ref> His work discusses the consequences that flow from conditioning the liberties of all citizens upon the behavior of criminals.  . 

Some of the earliest gun-control legislation at the state level were the "black codes" that replaced the "slave codes" after the Civil War, attempting to prevent blacks' having access to the full rights of citizens, including the [[right to keep and bear arms]]. <ref>Halbrook, SP: That Every Man be Armed: The evolution of a Constitutional Right.  2nd ed., The Independent Institute, Oakland, 1994:p. 108. </ref> Laws of this type later used racially neutral language to survive legal challenge, but were expected to be enforced against blacks rather than whites. <ref>[http://www.firearmsandliberty.com/cramer.racism.html Cramer, CE: The Racist Roots of Gun Control, 1993]. </ref> . 

A favorite target of gun control is so-called "junk guns," which are generally cheaper and therefore more accessible to the poor. However, some civil rights organizations favor tighter gun regulations. In 2003, the NAACP filed suit against 45 gun manufacturers for creating what it called a "public nuisance" through the "negligent marketing" of handguns, which included models commonly described as [[Saturday night special]]s. The suit alleged that handgun manufacturers and distributors were guilty of marketing guns in a way that encouraged violence in black and Hispanic neighborhoods. "The gun industry has refused to take even basic measures to keep criminals and prohibited persons from obtaining firearms," NAACP President/CEO [[Kweisi Mfume]] said. "The industry must be as responsible as any other and it must stop dumping firearms in [[Market saturation|over-saturated markets]]. The obvious result of dumping guns is that they will increasingly find their way into the hands of criminals."<ref>Editors (Sept/Oct 1999) "NAACP causes furor by suing gun manufacturers." New Crisis. </ref> . 

The NAACP lawsuit was dismissed in 2003. <ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE5DF173FF931A15754C0A9659C8B63] "Gun Makers Repel Lawsuit by N.A.A.C.P." New York Times, July 22, 2003. </ref> It, and several similar suits—some brought by municipalities seeking re-imbursement for medical costs associated with criminal shootings—were portrayed by gun-rights groups as "nuisance suits," aimed at driving gun manufacturers (especially smaller firms) out of business through court costs alone, as damage awards were not expected. <ref>[http://www.nraila.org/Issues/FactSheets/Read.aspx?id=37&issue=022 "Reckless Lawsuits: Courts Reject Lawsuits against Gun Makers." NRA-ILA, October 16, 2003]. </ref> These suits prompted the passage of the [[Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act]] in October, 2005.  . 

[[Martin Luther King]] said, "By our readiness to allow arms to be purchased at will and fired at whim... we have created an atmosphere in which violence and hatred have become popular pastimes."<ref>King Jr., Martin Luther and Clayborne Carson (2001) ''The Autobiography of Martin Luther King, Jr.'' New York: Grand Central Publishing. p. 147. </ref>  At the same time, Dr. King applied for a permit to carry a concealed firearm after his house was bombed in 1956. <ref name="huffingtonpost.com">Adam Winkler, ''MLK and his Guns'', ''at'' http://www.huffingtonpost.com/adam-winkler/mlk-and-his-guns_b_810132.html (last accessed 11/16/2011). </ref>  Professor Adam Winkler recounts that "William Worthy, a journalist who covered the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, reported that once, during a visit to King's parsonage, he went to sit down on an armchair in the living room and, to his surprise, almost sat on a loaded gun. Glenn Smiley, an adviser to King, described King's home as 'an arsenal.'"<ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/> . 

Similarly, the [[Dalai Lama]] said "If someone has a gun and is trying to kill you, it would be reasonable to shoot back with your own gun." (May 15, 2001, The Seattle Times) speaking at the "Educating Heart Summit" in Portland, Oregon, when asked by a girl how to react when a shooter takes aim at a classmate.  . 

[[Mahatma Gandhi]] said "Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look upon the Act depriving a whole nation of arms, as the blackest." in his autobiography.  . 

===Civic duty===. 
Some proponents of private gun ownership argue that an armed citizens' militia can help deter crime and tyranny, as police are primarily a reactive force whose main loyalty is to the government which pays their wages. The Militia Information Service (MIS) contends that gun ownership is a civic duty in the context of membership in the militia,
much like voting, neither of which they believe should be restricted to government officials in a true [[democracy]]. <ref>{{cite web

MIS also states that the people need to maintain the power of the sword so they can fulfil their duty, implicit in the [[social contract]], to protect the rights and liberties of their fellow citizens, much as individual citizens have a legal and ethical duty to protect dependents under their care, such as a child, elderly parent, or disabled spouse. <ref>{{cite web

===Statistics===. 
====Private ownership====. 
According to statistics available from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, of nearly 31,000 firearm-related deaths in 2005, suicides account for 55 percent of deaths in the United States whereas homicides account for 40 percent of deaths, accidents account for three percent, and the remaining two percent were legal killings.  . 

While many shootings occur in the course of a mutual argument of passion, others occur where a partner or family member of a "romantic" or familial relationship, who is an ongoing victim of domestic [[physical abuse]] or [[sexual abuse]], uses the force of a firearm in self-defense action against a perpetrator who also happens to be known to or related to the victim. As a corollary, in such policy advertising campaigns, the comparison of "domestic" gun casualties is usually not accompanied by [[murder]] and [[assault]] prosecution numbers stemming from the shootings occurring in that context. In many of the latter cases, the victim firing in self-defense is frequently a woman or youth victim of a more physically powerful abuser. In those situations gun rights advocates argue that the firearm arguably becomes an equalizer against the lethal and disabling force frequently exercised by the abusers. <ref>[http://haciendapublishing.com/blog/women-guns-and-disinformation Women, Guns and Disinformation by Miguel A. Faria, Jr., MD]. </ref> . 

Many gun control opponents point to statistics in advertising campaigns purporting that "approximately 9 or so children are killed by people discharging firearms every day across the US,"{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} and argue that this statistic is seldom accompanied by a differentiation of those children killed by individuals from unintentional discharges and stray bullets, and of those "children," under the age of majority—which is 18-21 in the U.S.—who are killed while acting as aggressors in [[street gang]] related mutual combat or while committing crimes,<ref>[http://haciendapublishing.com/medicalsentinel/statistical-malpractice-firearm-availability-and-violence-part-i-politics-or-science Statistical Malpractice — 'Firearm Availability' and Violence (Part I): Politics or Science? by Miguel A. Faria, Jr., MD]. </ref><ref>[http://haciendapublishing.com/blog/statistical-malpractice-%C2%AD-firearm-availability-and-violence-part-ii-poverty-education-and-other Statistical Malpractice — 'Firearm Availability' and Violence (Part II): Poverty, Education and other Socioeconomic Factors by Miguel A. Faria, Jr., MD]. </ref> many of which are seen as arising from the [[War on Drugs]]. There is further controversy regarding courts, trials, and the resulting sentences of these mostly "young men" as adults despite them not having reached the [[defense of infancy|age of consent]].  . 

====Gun safety and gun laws====. 
The importance of [[gun safety]] education has a mitigating effect on the occurrence of accidental discharges involving children. So much importance is not placed upon the [[vicarious liability]] case law assigning [[strict liability]] to the gun owner for firearms casualties occurring when a careless gun owner loses proper custody and control of a firearm.  . 

In an argument against gun control, the [[National Center for Policy Analysis]], a non-profit [[conservative]] [[think tank]], reported the following statistics. <ref>{{Cite book

* New Jersey adopted what sponsors described as "the most stringent gun law" in the nation in 1966; two years later the murder rate was up 46% and the reported robbery rate had nearly doubled. 
* In 1968, Hawaii imposed a series of increasingly harsh measures and its murder rate tripled from a low of 2.4 per 100,000 in 1968 to 7.2 by 1977. 
* In 1976, Washington, D.C. enacted one of the most restrictive gun control laws in the nation. Since then, the city's murder rate has risen 134% while the national murder rate has dropped 2%.  . 

In addition:
* New York State is one of many states that have adopted an Assault Weapon ban, which prohibits residents to purchase or own any assault rifles that fall under the description of, "large capacity ammunition feeding device." This includes fully automatic weapons. <ref>{{cite web|title=LAWS OF NEW YORK, 2000|url=http://criminaljustice.state.ny.us/legalservices/ch189_firearmballisticdatabank.htm|accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref>

* [[Evanston, Illinois]], a Chicago suburb of 75,000 residents, became the largest town to ban handgun ownership in September 1982 but experienced no decline in violent crime.

* In England, Wales and Scotland, the private ownership of most handguns was banned in 1997 following a gun massacre at a school in [[Dunblane massacre|Dunblane]] and an earlier gun massacre in [[Hungerford massacre|Hungerford]] in which the combined deaths was 35 and injured 30. Gun ownership and gun crime was already at a low level, which made these slaughters particularly concerning. Only an estimated 57,000 people —0.1% of the population owned such weapons prior to the ban. <ref>[http://www.firearmsafetyseminar.org.nz/_documents/Greenwood_Paper.pdf paragraph 58]. </ref> In the UK, only 8 per cent of all criminal homicides are committed with a firearm of any kind. <ref>[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/hosb0207.pdf Home Office statistical bulletin on Homicide and firearms offences in 2005/6]. </ref> In 2005/6 the number of such deaths in England and Wales (population 53.3 million) was just 50, a reduction of 36 per cent on the year before and lower than at any time since 1998/9. The lowest rate of gun crime was in 2004/4 whilst the highest was in 1994.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} There was, however, a noticeable temporary increase in gun crime in the years immediately after the ban, though this has since fallen back. The reason for the increase has not been investigated thoroughly but it is thought that 3 factors may have raised the number of guns in circulation. These are, the reduction in gun crime in Northern Ireland (which led to guns coming from there to the criminal black market in England); guns (official issue or confiscated) acquired by military personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan; and guns coming from Eastern Europe after the fall of the iron curtain.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Firearm injuries in England and [[Wales]] also noticeably increased in this time. <ref>''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6372717.stm Blair wants gun crime age reduced]'', BBC News, February 18, 2007. </ref> In 2005-06, of 5,001 such injuries, 3,474 (69%) were defined as "slight," and a further 965 (19%) involved the "firearm" being used as a [[blunt instrument]]. Twenty-four percent of injuries were caused with [[air gun]]s, and 32% with "imitation firearms" (including [[airsoft|airsoft guns]]). <ref>[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/hosb0207.pdf Homicides, Firearm Offences and Intimate Violence 2005/2006 Supplementary Volume 1 to Crime in England and Wales (2005/2006)<!--Bot-generated title-->]. </ref> Since 1998, the number of fatal shootings has varied between 49 and 97, and was 50 in 2005.

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]'s annual [[Uniform Crime Report]] ranking of cities over 40,000 in population by violent crime rates (per 100,000 population) finds that the ten cities with the highest violent crime rates for 2003 include three cities in the very strict state of New Jersey, one in the fairly restrictive state of [[Massachusetts]].  .

== History ==. 
===Gun control in the United States===. 
{{Main|Gun politics in the United States}} . 

Before the [[American Civil War]] ended, [[U.S. state|state]] [[slave codes]] prohibited slaves from owning guns. After [[slavery]] in the U.S. was abolished, states persisted in prohibiting [[Black people]] from owning guns under laws renamed [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]].  . 

The United States Congress overrode most portions of the Black Codes by passing the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]]. The legislative histories of both the Civil Rights Act and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], as well as The Special Report of the Anti-Slavery Conference of 1867, are replete with denunciations of those particular statutes that denied blacks equal access to firearms. <ref>Kates, "Handgun Prohibition and the Original Meaning of the Second Amendment," 82 Mich. L. Rev. 204, 256 1983</ref> . 

After the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1878, most states turned to "facially neutral" business or transaction taxes on handgun purchases. However, the intention of these laws was not neutral. An article in [[Virginia]]'s official university [[law review]] called for a "prohibitive tax...on the privilege" of selling handguns as a way of disarming "the son of Ham," whose "cowardly practice of 'toting' guns has been one of the most fruitful sources of crime.... Let a [[negro]] board a railroad train with a quart of mean [[whiskey]] and a [[pistol]] in his grip and the chances are that there will be a murder, or at least a row, before he alights."<ref>Carrying Concealed Weapons, 15 Va L. Reg. 391, 391-92, 1909 [[George Mason University Civil Rights Law Journal]] (GMU CR LJ), Vol. 2, No. 1, "Gun Control and Racism," Stefan Tahmassebi, 1991, p. 75</ref> Thus, many Southern States imposed high taxes or banned inexpensive guns in order to price destitute individuals out of the gun market.  . 

In the 1990s, gun control laws continued to be enacted: . 

* Police-issued license and permit laws, unless drafted to require issuance to those not prohibited by law from owning guns, are routinely used to prevent lawful gun ownership among "unpopular" populations. 
* Public housing residents, approximately three million Americans, are singled out for gun bans. 
* "Gun sweeps" by police in "high crime neighborhoods" whereby vehicles and "pedestrians who meet a specific profile that might indicate they are carrying a weapon" are searched are becoming popular, and are being studied by the [[United States Department of Justice]] as "Operation Ceasefire."
* In certain communities with a history of good law enforcement after gun control legislation was introduced the crime rates, paticuarly the homicide rates, have decreased. Pro gun control advocates say this is proof gun control works as long as its enforced. But nothing can be said either way 100% of the time.  . 

===Gun control in Australia===. 
{{Main|Gun politics in Australia}} . 

In response to the [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Port Arthur massacre]] in 1996, gun law proposals developed from the report of the 1988 National Committee on Violence<ref>http://aic.gov.au/publications/proceedings/12/chappell.pdf</ref> were adopted under a National Firearms Agreement. This was necessary because the Australian Constitution does not give the Commonwealth power to enact gun laws.  . 

The National Firearms Agreement banned all semi-automatic rifles and all semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns, and created a tightly restrictive system of licensing and ownership controls. Because the Australian Constitution prevents the taking of property without just compensation the [[Federal Government of Australia|Federal Government]] introduced the Medicare Levy Amendment Act 1996 that provided the revenue for the National Firearms Program through a one-off 0.2% increase in the Medicare levy. Known as the gun buy-back scheme, it started across the country on the 1 October 1996 and concluded on the 30 September 1997<ref>http://www.anao.gov.au/uploads/documents/1997-98_Audit_Report_25.pdf</ref> to purchase and destroy all semi-automatic rifles including .22 rimfires, semi-automatic shotguns and pump-action shotguns. The buyback was predicted to cost $A500 million and had wide community support.  . 

In 2002, the [[Monash University shooting]] led the federal government to urge [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|state governments]] to again review handgun laws, and, as a result, amended legislation was adopted in all states and territories. Changes included a 10-round [[Magazine (firearm)|magazine]] capacity limit, a calibre limit of not more than .38&nbsp;inches (9.65&nbsp;mm), a [[gun barrel|barrel]] length limit of not less than 120&nbsp;mm (4.72&nbsp;inches) for [[semi-automatic pistols]] and 100&nbsp;mm (3.94&nbsp;inches) for revolvers, and even stricter probation and attendance requirements for sporting target shooters.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} In the state of [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] $A21 million compensation was paid for confiscating 18,124 target pistols, and 15,184 replacement pistols were imported.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} .  . 

One government policy was to compensate shooters for giving up the sport. Approximately 25% of pistol shooters took this offer, and relinquished their licences and their right to own pistols for sport for five years.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} . 

There is contention over the effects of the gun control laws in Australia, with some researchers reporting significant drops in gun-related crime,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ozanne-Smith |first=J |coauthors=, K Ashby, S Newstead, V Z Stathakis and A Clapperton |title=Firearm related deaths: the impact of regulatory reform
