The '''spoiler effect''' describes the effect a [[minor party]] candidate with little chance of winning has in a close [[election]], when that candidate's presence in the election draws votes from a major candidate similar to him, thereby causing a candidate dissimilar to him to win the election.  The minor candidate causing this effect is often referred to as a ''spoiler''.  . 

If [[preferential voting|preferential ballots]] are not used, the spoiler candidate takes votes away from the viable similar candidate (an effect called [[vote splitting]]).  In some cases, even though the spoiler candidate cannot win themselves, their influence upon the voters may allow them to deliberately determine which of the viable candidates wins the electionâ€”a situation known as a [[kingmaker scenario]].  . 

In a preferential voting system, a voter can vote for a minor party candidate as their first choice, and in addition, they can record a preference between the remaining candidates, whether they are in a "major party" or not. For example, voters for a very left-wing candidate might select a moderately left-wing candidate as their second choice, thus minimizing the chances that their vote will result in the election of a right-wing candidate. [[Approval voting]] can also reduce the impact of the "spoiler effect".  . 

One of the main functions of political parties is to mitigate the effect of spoiler-prone voting methods by winnowing the contenders before the election. Each party nominates at most one candidate per office since each party expects to lose if they nominate more than one. (In some cases, a party can expect to "lose" if they nominate more than zero, since nominating one can cause spoiling when there are three or more parties; the party may prefer the candidate who would win if the party nominates zero.) For example, if the Democrats had nominated both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama for U.S. President in 2008, it would have allowed the Republican candidate (John McCain) to easily win; the voters who preferred both Clinton and Obama over McCain could not have been relied on to solve the strategy coordination problem on their own. Thus, empirical observations of the frequency of spoiled elections do not provide a good measure of how prone to spoiling the voting method is, since the observations omit the relevant information about potential candidates (e.g., Hillary Clinton) who did not run because they did not want to spoil the election.  . 

==Mathematical definitions==. 
{{details3|[[Decision theory]] and [[Social choice theory]]|the mathematics of elections}} . 

Possible mathematical definitions for the spoiler effect include failure of the [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] (IIA) axiom, and vote splitting.  . 

[[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] states that rank-voting systems are unable to satisfy the [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] criterion without exhibiting other undesirable properties as a consequence. However, different [[voting system]]s are affected to a greater or lesser extent by IIA failure. For example, [[instant runoff voting]] is considered to have less frequent IIA failure than [[First Past the Post]] (also known as [[Plurality_voting_system| Plurality Rule]]). The [[independence of Smith-dominated alternatives]] (ISDA) criterion is much weaker than IIA; unlike IIA, some ranked-ballot voting methods can pass ISDA.  . 

A possible definition of spoiling based on vote splitting is as follows: Let W denote the candidate who wins the election, and let X and S denote two other candidates. If X would have won had S not been one of the nominees, and if (most of) the voters who prefer S over W also prefer X over W (either S>X>W or X>S>W), then S is a spoiler. Here is an example to illustrate: Suppose the voters' orders of preference are as follows: . 

{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" 
| 33%: S>X>W
| 15%: X>S>W
| 17%: X>W>S
| 35%: W>X>S
|} . 

The voters who prefer S over W also prefer X over W. W is the winner under Plurality Rule, Top Two Runoff, and Instant Runoff. If S is deleted from the votes (so that the 33% who ranked S on top now rank X on top) then X would be the winner (by 65% landslide majority). Thus S is a spoiler with these three voting methods.  . 

==The spoiler effect in American elections==. 
===Presidential elections===. 
====Bush, Gore, and Nader (2000 U.S. presidential election)====. 
The [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. Presidential election]] is often cited as an example of the spoiler effect. In that election, [[Al Gore]], the Democratic candidate, received more popular votes than [[George W. Bush]], the Republican candidate, but lost in the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral college]]. In the state of [[Florida]], the final certified vote count showed Bush with just 537 more votes than Gore. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/2000presgeresults.htm|title=2000 Official Presidential General Election Results|date=December 2001|publisher=Federal Election Commission|author=Public Disclosure Division|accessdate=August 30, 2010}}</ref> Because Bush defeated Gore in Florida, he won the state, received more votes in the electoral college, and became president of the United States.  . 

Gore supporters pointed out that, had candidate [[Ralph Nader]], a liberal, not run in the election, the majority of the 97,421 votes he received in Florida would have been cast for Gore.  Gore supporters contend that Nader's candidacy spoiled the election for Gore by taking away enough votes from Gore in Florida to swing the election to Bush. Their argument is bolstered by a poll of Nader voters, asking them for whom they would have voted had Nader not run, which said 45 percent of Nader voters would have voted for Gore, 27 percent would have voted for Bush, and the rest would not have voted. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E4D6173CF937A15751C0A9629C8B63|title=Relax, Nader Advises Alarmed Democrats, but the 2000 Math Counsels Otherwise|last=Rosenbaum|first=David E.|date=February 24, 2004|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=August 30, 2010|location=New York}}</ref> . 

Nader himself and many of his supporters argued that most Nader voters would either have chosen another minor party candidate or [[abstain]]ed from voting, had Nader not been on the ballot. Some observers began to refer to the spoiler effect as the "Nader effect" after the 2000 election. <ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,994287,00.html|journal=Time|last=Bacon Jr.|first=Perry|last2=Tumulty|first=Karen|title=The Nader Effect|date=May 31, 2004|accessdate=August 30, 2010}}</ref>

===Other elections===. 
*In 1994 moderate Republican [[Marshall Coleman]] ran for the U.S. Senate as an independent, receiving over 11 percent of the vote in an election where Democrat [[Chuck Robb]] defeated Republican nominee [[Oliver North]] by only three percent of the vote.  . 

*As a result of the [[2011 Wisconsin protests]] and subsequent [[recall election]]s, the [[Wisconsin Republican Party]] is openly encouraging spoiler candidates to run in the recall elections on the Democrat ticket in order to force the Democrats into a [[Primary election]].  Republicans argue that this will even the playing field in the recalls, as incumbents facing recall will not have the time to campaign due to their work load in the [[Wisconsin State Senate|state senate]]. <ref name=WGBSC>{{cite news|title=Wisconsin GOP backs spoiler candidates in recall elections|url=http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/elections/article_df8f9e60-9056-11e0-8101-001cc4c03286.html|newspaper=WSJ}}</ref> . 

==Other countries== . 

The spoiler effect has also been seen in other countries, such as [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. There, a minority party with no chance of winning, [[Congress of the People (Trinidad and Tobago)|Congress of the People]], took votes from its former party, the [[United National Congress]] and made it lose seats, thus allowing the [[incumbent]] [[People's National Movement]], highly disfavoured for the elections, to take the Government role again.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} . 

In New Zealand, there have been two notable cases of the spoiler effect. In the [[New Zealand general election, 1984|1984 general election]], the free-market [[New Zealand Party]] deliberately ran for office in order to weaken support for the incumbent Prime Minister [[Robert Muldoon]]. Later on, the [[New Zealand general election, 1993|1993 general election]] saw the [[New Zealand Labour Party]]'s vote split by [[Alliance (New Zealand)|The Alliance]], which has been attributed to the vagaries of the [[first past the post]] electoral system.  . 

==Sports==. 
In sports, the "spoiler effect" refers to a similar phenomenon, in which a team or individual has failed to win enough games or competitions to make the playoffs or qualification rounds like the finals, but affects the playoffs or finals anyway by beating a more successful team or individual before the end of the season. For example, a baseball team that is ten games out of contention for a playoff berth could defeat a team that has a playoff berth several times. This could cause the would-be playoff team to be passed by in the rankings by the team directly behind it before the final positions at the end of the season are determined.  . 

In individual participant sports, such as automobile racing, a racer with no hope of obtaining a championship title could prevent a racer with a chance at the title by defeating them, preventing the contending racer from earning critical points toward winning the title. Instead, the title would go to the contender directly behind him in the rankings, provided that second-tier racer is close enough to surpass and they win their own competition.  .
