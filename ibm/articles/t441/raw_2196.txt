An '''election''' is a formal [[Decision making|decision-making process]] by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office. <ref name = Brit>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/182308/election "Election (political science),"] Encyclpoedia Britanica Online. Accessed August 18, 2009</ref> Elections have been the usual mechanism by which modern [[representative democracy]] has operated since the 17th century. <ref name = Brit/> Elections may fill offices in the [[legislature]], sometimes in the [[executive (government)|executive]] and [[judiciary]], and for [[regional government|regional]] and [[local government]]. This process is also used in many other private and [[business]] organizations, from clubs to [[voluntary association]]s and [[corporation]]s.  . 

The universal use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives in modern democracies is in contrast with the practice in the democratic [[archetype]], ancient [[History of Athens|Athens]]. As the Elections were considered an [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] institution and most political offices were filled using [[sortition]], also known as allotment, by which officeholders were chosen by lot.  . 

[[Electoral reform]] describes the process of introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in place, or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems. [[Psephology]] is the study of results and other [[statistics]] relating to elections (especially with a view to predicting future results).  . 

To ''elect'' means "to choose or make a decision"<ref>[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/elect Wiktionary - Elect]</ref> and so sometimes other forms of ballot such as [[referendum]]s are referred to as elections, especially in the United States.

==History==. 
{{see also|History of democracy}}
[[File:Roman Election.jpg|thumb|left|[[Roman coin]] depicting election]]
Elections were used as early in history as [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]], and throughout the Medieval period to select rulers such as the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[the Pope]]. <ref name = Brit/> In [[History of India|ancient India]], around 920 AD, in [[Tamil Nadu]], Palm leaves were used for village assembly elections. The palm leaves with candidate names, will be put inside a mud pot, for counting. This was called ''Kudavolai'' system. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tn.gov.in/policynotes/pdf/rural_development.pdf |title=Panchayat Raj, Policy notes 2011-2012 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Rural development & panchayat raj department, TN Government, India |accessdate=3 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://tnsec.tn.nic.in/historical/Pre%20Independence.html |title=Pre-Independence Method of Election|author= |date= |work= |publisher=Tamil Nadu State Election Commission, India|accessdate=3 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Handbook on Kongu archaeological treasures|url=http://www.hindu.com/lf/2005/06/27/stories/2005062701170200.htm|accessdate=|newspaper=The Hindu|date=27 June 2005|location=Coimbatore, India}}</ref> Elections were also used to select [[raja]]s by the ''[[gana]]''. Ancient Arabs also used election to choose their caliph, [[The election of Uthman|Uthman]] and [[Ali as Caliph|Ali]], in the early medieval [[Rashidun Caliphate]];<ref>''Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World'' (2004), vol. 1, p. 116-123. </ref> and to select the [[Pala Empire|Pala]] king [[Gopala (Pala king)|Gopala]] in early medieval [[Bengal]]. <ref>History of Buddhism in India, Translation: A. Shiefner. </ref> The modern "election", which consists of public elections of government officials, didn't emerge until the beginning of the 17th century when the idea of [[representative government]] took hold in North America and Europe. <ref name = Brit/>  . 

{{further2|[[Suffrage]]}}
Questions of [[suffrage]], especially suffrage for minority groups, have dominated the history of elections. Males, the dominate cultural group in North America and Europe, often dominated the [[electorate]] and continue to do so in many countries. <ref name = Brit/> Early elections in countries such as the [[Elections in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] and [[Elections in the United States|the United States]] were dominated by [[landed gentry|landed]] or [[ruling class]] males. <ref name = Brit/> However, by 1920 all Western European and North American democracies had universal male suffrage (except Switzerland) and many countries began to consider [[women's suffrage]]. <ref name = Brit/> Despite legally mandated universal suffrage for males, political barriers were sometimes erected to prevent fair access to elections (See [[Civil Rights movement]]). <ref name = Brit/> . 

==Characteristics==. 
===Suffrage===. 
{{further2|[[Suffrage]]}}
The question of who may vote is a central issue in elections. The electorate does not generally include the entire population; for example, many countries prohibit those judged mentally [[competence (law)|incompetent]] from voting, and all jurisdictions require a minimum age for voting.  . 

Historically, other groups of people have also been excluded from [[voting]].  For instance, the democracy of ancient Athens did not allow women, foreigners, or slaves to vote, and the original [[United States Constitution]] left the topic of suffrage to the states; usually only white male property owners were able to vote.  Much of the history of elections involves the effort to promote suffrage for excluded groups.  The [[women's suffrage]] movement gave women in many countries the right to vote, and securing the right to vote freely was a major goal of the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|American civil rights movement]].  Extending voting rights to excluded groups (such as convicted [[felony|felons]], members of certain minorities, and the economically disadvantaged) continues to be a goal of voting rights advocates.  . 

Suffrage is typically only for citizens of the country, though further limits may be imposed. However, in the European Union, one can vote in municipal elections if one lives in the municipality and is an EU citizen; the nationality of the country of residence is not required.

In some countries, voting is [[Compulsory voting|required by law]]; if an eligible voter does not cast a vote, he or she may be subject to punitive measures such as a small fine.  . 

===Nomination===. 
A [[representative democracy]] requires a procedure to govern nomination for political office. In many cases, nomination for office is mediated through [[preselection]] processes in organized political parties. <ref>Reuven Hazan, 'Candidate Selection', in Lawrence LeDuc, Richard Niemi and Pippa Norris (eds), ''Comparing Democracies 2'', Sage Publications, London, 2002</ref> . 

Non-partisan systems tend to differ from partisan systems as concerns nominations. In a [[direct democracy]], one type of [[non-partisan democracy]], any eligible person can be nominated. In some non-partisan representative systems no nominations (or campaigning, electioneering, etc.) take place at all, with voters free to choose any person at the time of voting—with some possible exceptions such as through a minimum age requirement—in the jurisdiction. In such cases, it is not required (or even possible) that the members of the electorate be familiar with all of the eligible persons, though such systems may involve indirect elections at larger geographic levels to ensure that some first-hand familiarity among potential electees can exist at these levels (i.e., among the elected delegates).  . 

As far as partisan systems, in some countries, only members of a particular [[political party]] can be nominated.  Or, an eligible person can be nominated through a [[petition]]; thus allowing him or her to be listed on a something.  . 

===Electoral systems===. 
Electoral systems are the detailed constitutional arrangements and [[voting system]]s that convert the vote into political decision. The first step is to tally the votes, for which various [[vote counting systems]] and [[ballot]] types are used. Voting systems then determine the result on the basis of the tally. Most systems can be categorized as either [[Proportional representation|proportional]] or [[majoritarian]].  Among the former are [[party-list proportional representation]] and [[additional member system]].  Among the latter are [[First Past the Post electoral system|First Past the Post (FPP)]] (relative majority) and [[absolute majority]].  Many countries have growing electoral reform movements, which advocate systems such as [[approval voting]], [[single transferable vote]], [[instant runoff voting]] or a [[Condorcet method]]; these methods are also gaining popularity for lesser elections in some countries where more important elections still use more traditional counting methods.  . 

While openness and [[accountability]] are usually considered cornerstones of a democratic system, the act of casting a vote and the content of a voter's ballot are usually an important exception.  The [[secret ballot]] is a relatively modern development, but it is now considered crucial in most free and fair elections, as it limits the effectiveness of intimidation.  . 

===Scheduling===. 
The nature of democracy is that elected officials are accountable to the people, and they must return to the voters at prescribed intervals to seek their [[mandate (politics)|mandate]] to continue in office. For that reason most democratic constitutions provide that elections are held at fixed regular intervals. In the United States, elections are held between every three and six years in most states, with exceptions such as the U.S. [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], which stands for election every two years. There is a variety of schedules, for example presidents: the [[President of Ireland]] is elected every seven years, the [[President of Russia]] and the [[President of Finland]] every six years, the [[President of France]] every five years, [[President of United States]] every four years.  . 

Pre-determined or fixed election dates have the advantage of fairness and predictability. However, they tend to greatly lengthen campaigns, and make [[dissolution of parliament|dissolving the legislature]] (parliamentary system) more problematic if the date should happen to fall at time when dissolution is inconvenient (e.g. when war breaks out). Other states (e.g., the [[United Kingdom]]) only set maximum time in office, and the executive decides exactly when within that limit it will actually go to the polls. In practice, this means the government remains in power for close to its full term, and choose an election date it calculates to be in its best interests (unless something special happens, such as a [[motion of no-confidence]]). This calculation depends on a number of variables, such as its performance in opinion polls and the size of its majority.  . 

Elections are usually held on one day. There are also [[advance poll]]s and [[absentee voting]], which have a more flexible schedule. In Europe, a substantial proportion of votes are cast in advance voting.  . 

===Election campaigns===. 
{{main|Political campaign}}
When elections are called, politicians and their supporters attempt to influence policy by competing directly for the votes of constituents in what are called campaigns.  Supporters for a campaign can be either formally organized or loosely affiliated, and frequently utilize [[campaign advertising]]. It is common for political scientists to attempt to predict elections via [[Political Forecasting]] methods.  . 

===Difficulties with elections===. 
{{main|Electoral fraud}} . 

In many countries with weak [[rule of law]], the most common reason why elections do not meet international standards of being "free and fair" is interference from the incumbent government. [[Dictator]]s may use the powers of the executive (police, martial law, censorship, physical implementation of the election mechanism, etc.) to remain in power despite popular opinion in favor of removal. Members of a particular faction in a legislature may use the power of the majority or supermajority (passing criminal laws, defining the electoral mechanisms including eligibility and district boundaries) to prevent the balance of power in the body from shifting to a rival faction due to an election.  . 

Non-governmental entities can also interfere with elections, through physical force, verbal intimidation, or fraud, which can result in improper casting or counting of votes. Monitoring for and minimizing electoral fraud is also an ongoing task in countries with strong traditions of free and fair elections. Problems that prevent an election from being "free and fair" take various forms: . 

; Lack of open political debate or an informed electorate
: The electorate may be poorly informed about issues or candidates due to lack of [[freedom of the press]], lack of objectivity in the press due to state or corporate control, or lack of access to news and political media. [[Freedom of speech]] may be curtailed by the state, favoring certain viewpoints or state [[propaganda]].  . 

; Unfair rules
: This can include [[Gerrymandering]], exclusion of opposition candidates from eligibility for office, and manipulating thresholds for electoral success are some of the ways the structure of an election can be changed to favor a specific faction or candidate.  . 

; Interference with campaigns
:Those in power may arrest or assassinate candidates, suppress or even criminalize campaigning, close campaign headquarters, harass or beat campaign workers, or intimidate voters with violence.  . 

; Tampering with the election mechanism
: This can include confusing or misleading voters about how to vote, violation of the [[secret ballot]], [[ballot stuffing]], tampering with voting machines, destruction of legitimately cast ballots, [[voter suppression]], voter registration fraud, failure to validate voter residency, fraudulent tabulation of results, and use of physical force or verbal intimation at polling places.  .
