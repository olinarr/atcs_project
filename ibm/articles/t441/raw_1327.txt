'''[[Primary election|Primary elections]]''' were first introduced '''in [[Italy]]''' by [[Lega Nord]] in 1995,<ref>[http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1995/marzo/04/paese_partiti_lumbard_co_0_9503049703.shtml Un paese, 2 partiti lumbard<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> but were seldom used until before the [[Italian regional elections, 2005|2005 regional elections]]. In that occasion the centre-left [[The Union (political coalition)|The Union]] coalition held open primaries in order to select candidates for President of [[Apulia]] and [[Calabria]].  . 

A more politically significant primary was held on 16 October 2005, when The Union asked its voters to decide the candidate for Prime Minister in the next [[Italian general election, 2006|general election]]: 4,300,000 voters showed up and [[Romano Prodi]] won hands down. Two years later, on 14 October 2007, voters of the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] were called to choose the party leader among a list of six, their representatives to the Constituent Assembly and the local leaders. The primary was a success, involving more than 3,000,000 people across Italy, and gave to the winner [[Walter Veltroni]] momentum in a difficult period for the government and the centre-left coalition.  . 

The centre-right [[House of Freedoms]]/[[The People of Freedom]] has never held a primary at the national level, but held some experiments at the very local level.  . 

==Legislative rules==. 
There are no laws at the national level to govern the conduct of any primary election. In [[Tuscany]] a regional law regulates party primaries, but parties are not mandated to hold primaries. As of today, these rules were used only once by the [[Democrats of the Left]] in 2005.  . 

==List of most relevant primary elections in Italy==. 
In the following list are included the results of primary elections for prime minister, regional president, mayor of big city (above 100,000 inhabitants), and leader of a major party.  .
