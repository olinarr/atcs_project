In [[politics of the United States|United States politics]], a '''sore-loser law''' is a law which states that the loser in a [[primary election]] can't then run as an [[independent (politician)|independent]] in the general election. <ref>[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/oct/24/florida-eyes-sore-loser-election-law/ Washingtontimes.com]</ref> These laws do not apply to [[presidential candidate]]s. Many states accomplish the same requirement by having simultaneous registration dates for the primary and the general election; in fact only the states of [[Connecticut]], [[Iowa]], [[New York]] and [[Vermont]] don't have either a sore-loser law or simultaneous registration deadlines. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://rangevoting.org/BallAccess.html|title="Sore loser laws" designed to foster major-party rule and prevent dissent|publisher=RangeVoting.org|accessdate=17 October 2011}}</ref> .
