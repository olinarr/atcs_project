The '''2012 Democratic presidential primaries and caucuses''' is the selection process by which voters of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] will choose its nominee for [[President of the United States]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 U.S. presidential election]]. Incumbent President [[Barack Obama]] is seeking the Democratic Party nomination through a series of [[primary election]]s and [[caucus]]es culminating in the [[2012 Democratic National Convention]] held September 3–6, in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].  . 

==Primary race overview==. 
The general expectation was that, with President [[Barack Obama]] having the advantage of [[incumbency]] and being the only viable candidate running, the race would be merely [[pro forma]]. The last time an incumbent was seriously challenged was during the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1980|1980 Democratic primaries]] when Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] of Massachusetts carried 12 states while running against President [[Jimmy Carter]].  . 

Several of the lesser-known candidates made efforts to raise visibility. Some [[Occupy movement]] activists made an attempt to take over the [[Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2012|Iowa Caucuses]],<ref>http://www.salon.com/2012/01/04/the_complete_failure_and_unnoticed_success_of_occupy_iowa/singleton/</ref> and managed to get about 2% of the vote for Uncommitted. With eight minor candidates on the ballot in New Hampshire, there was a debate at [[Saint Anselm College]] in [[Goffstown, New Hampshire]] on December 19, 2011,<ref>http://www.unionleader.com/article/20111220/NEWS0605/712209967</ref> in which seven candidates participated. [[Pro-life]] activist Randall Terry bought time on television in order to show graphic commercials denouncing [[abortion]]. <ref>{{cite web|author=Tim Murphy |url=http://motherjones.com/mojo/2011/12/aborted-fetus-campaign-ads-hit-airwaves-iowa |title=Aborted Fetus Campaign Ads Hit the Airwaves in Iowa |publisher=Mother Jones |date=2011-12-06 |accessdate=2012-01-01}}</ref> . 

Three candidates – other than Obama – who had been on the ballot in New Hampshire were also on the ballot in Missouri. One such candidate, Randal Terry, attempted to air graphic TV commercials during [[Super Bowl XLIV]], but was met with resistance from various TV stations<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/480176-FCC_Says_WMAQ_Had_Right_to_Deny_Super_Bowl_Ad_to_Candidate.php | title=FCC Says WMAQ Had Right to Deny Super Bowl Ad to Candidate | work=[[Broadcasting & Cable]] | date=February 6, 2012 | accessdate=February 7, 2012 | author=Eggerton, John}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0212/72430.html | title=FCC: TV can nix Super Bowl abortion ad | work=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]] | date=February 3, 2012 | accessdate=February 7, 2012 | author=Boliek, Brooks}}</ref> in some locations. The [[Democratic National Committee]] also tried to stop the ads by claiming that Terry was not a legitimate Democratic candidate even though he was legally on the ballot. <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ballot-access.org/2012/02/01/democratic-national-committee-says-randall-terry-should-not-be-considered-a-bona-fide-candidate-for-broadcast-purposes/ | title=Democratic National Committee Says Randall Terry Should Not be Considered a Bona Fide Candidate for Broadcast Purposes | work=[[Ballot Access News]] | date=February 1, 2012 | accessdate=February 2, 2012 | author=[[Richard Winger|Winger, Richard]]}}</ref> . 

A number of [[birther movement]] partisans, challenging the legitimacy of Obama's [[Birthright citizenship in the United States|birthright citizenship]], attempted to have the President's name removed from the Georgia primary ballot. A state administrative judge upheld a [[subpoena]], which was ignored by the President and his staff. <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/01/23/2603770/georgia-judge-orders-president.html | title=Georgia judge orders President Obama to appear in court over 'birthers' suit | work=[[The Miami Herald]] | date=January 23, 2012 | accessdate=February 2, 2012 | author=Williams, Chuck}}</ref> In February 2012, the birther activists' legal challenge was rejected by a Georgia state law judge and by the [[Secretary of State of Georgia]], and Obama remained listed on the primary ballot. <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-politics-elections/judge-obama-eligible-to-1330300.html | title=Judge: Obama eligible to be Georgia candidate | work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] | date=February 3, 2012 | accessdate=February 7, 2012 | author=Rankin, Bill}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.macon.com/2012/02/07/1895507/ga-sos-says-obama-to-remain-on.html | title=Ga.

Only six states - New Hampshire, Missouri, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Texas, and West Virgina - have permitted challengers to President Obama, while a seventh (Ohio) was going to have Randall Terry on the ballot, but removed his name before the ballots were printed.  .

==Delegate allocation==. 
{{see also|United States presidential primary#Process}}
The number of pledged delegates allocated to each of the 50 U.S. states and [[Washington, D.C.]] is based on two main factors: (1) the proportion of votes each state gave to the Democratic candidate in the last three presidential elections, and (2) the number of electoral votes each state has in the [[United States Electoral College]]. In addition, fixed numbers of delegates are allocated to [[Puerto Rico]], [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], and Democrats Abroad under the party's delegate selection rules. <ref name="greenpapersDelegates"/> Depending on each state's law and each state's party rules, when voters cast ballots for a candidate in a presidential caucus or primary, they may be voting to actually award delegates bound to vote for a particular candidate at the state or national convention (''binding'' primary or caucus), or they may simply be expressing an opinion that the state party is not bound to follow in selecting delegates to the national convention (''non-binding'' primary or caucus).  . 

States are awarded bonus pledged delegates if they schedule their primary or caucus later in the primary season. Those states with April dates are awarded a 10 percent increase, while those who schedule from May 1 to June 12 get a 20 percent increase. And starting on March 20, a 15 percent bonus is awarded when clusters of three or more neighboring states begin on the same day. <ref name="greenpapersDelegates"/> . 

The unpledged [[superdelegate]]s will include members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]], state and territorial [[List of current United States Governors|governors]], members of the Democratic National Committee, and other party leaders. Because of possible deaths, resignations, or the results of intervening or special elections, the final number of these superdelegates may not be known until the week of the convention.  .

; Notes
# Florida's legislature set the date for its primary on January 31, violating the scheduling guidelines of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The DNC has since declared Florida's primary as nonbinding, and therefore an alternate delegate selection system consisting of county caucuses will now take place on May 5, followed by a state convention in June. 
# Randall Terry collected 18% of the votes, winning twelve counties, in the Oklahoma primary, qualifying him for seven delegates to the 2012 Democratic National Convention.  Jim Rogers collected 13% of the votes, winning three counties, qualifying him for three delegates (one from each of three Congressional Districts where he collected over 15%). <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P12/OK-D|title=Oklahoma-Democratic Primary|publisher=The Green Papers|accessdate=March 22, 2012}}</ref> .
