'''Party Raiding''' is the term for members of one political party voting in another party's primary in an effort to either nominate a weaker candidate or at the very least prolong divided support between two or more contenders for that party's nomination (especially for President). <ref name="Issacharoff">{{cite book|title=The Law of Democracy |last=Issacharoff |first=Samuel |year=2007 |publisher=Thompson West |isbn=1587784602 |pages=276}}</ref> . 

Party raiding can only occur in jurisdictions which allow [[open primary]] voting.  As examples, [[Texas]] permits open primary voting (though a voter cannot vote in both primaries), while neighboing [[Oklahoma]] operates under a [[closed primary]] system (with one catch: a state party can open its primary to independent voters at the sole discretion of the party chairman).  . 

A notable example of attempted party raiding was [[The Rush Limbaugh Show#Operation Chaos|Operation Chaos]] in the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|Democratic primary]] in 2008 when [[Rush Limbaugh]] encouraged [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] to vote for [[Hillary Clinton]] in an effort to weaken [[Barack Obama]] politically. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/04/rush-limbaugh.html | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Top of the Ticket | date=April 29, 2008}}</ref>  Another occurred in the 2012 Republican primaries, where many Democratic voters in Michigan voted for weaker GOP candidate [[Rick Santorum]] over front-runner [[Mitt Romney]] in order to disrupt his campaign. <ref>http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120228/NEWS15/120228049/Many-Democrats-voting-Santorum-Paul-deny-Romney-Michigan-win&odyssey=mod|breaking|text|FRONTPAGE</ref> .
