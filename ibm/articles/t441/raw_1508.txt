'''Copeland's method''' or '''Copeland's pairwise aggregation method''' is a [[Condorcet method]] in which candidates are ordered by the number of pairwise victories, minus the number of pairwise defeats. <ref>{{cite book

Proponents argue that this method is easily understood by the general populace, which is generally familiar with the sporting equivalent.  In many [[round-robin tournament]]s, the winner is the competitor with the most victories.  It is also easy to calculate.  . 

When there is no Condorcet winner (i.e. when there are multiple members of the [[Smith set]]), this method often leads to ties. For example, if there is a three-candidate [[Condorcet method#Circular ambiguities|majority rule cycle]], each candidate will have exactly one loss, and there will be an unresolved tie between the three.  . 

Critics argue that it also puts too much emphasis on the quantity of pairwise victories and defeats rather than their magnitudes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} .

The results of the 6 possible pairwise comparisons between the candidates are as follows: . 

{| class="wikitable"
. |-
!Comparison               !! Result  !! Winner
. |-
|Memphis vs Nashville     || 42 v 58 || Nashville
. |-
|Memphis vs Knoxville     || 42 v 58 || Knoxville
. |-
|Memphis vs Chattanooga   || 42 v 58 || Chattanooga
. |-
|Nashville vs Knoxville   || 68 v 32 || Nashville
. |-
|Nashville vs Chattanooga || 68 v 32 || Nashville
. |-
|Knoxville vs Chattanooga || 17 v 83 || Chattanooga
|} . 

The wins and losses of each candidate sum as follows: . 

{| class="wikitable"
. |-
!Candidate   !! Wins  !! Losses !! Wins - Losses
. |-
|Memphis     || 0     || 3      || -3
. |-
|Nashville   || 3     || 0      || 3
. |-
|Knoxville   || 1     || 2      || -1
. |-
|Chattanooga || 2     || 1      || 1
|} . 

'''Nashville''', the Condorcet winner, has the greatest number of wins and is the Copeland winner.  . 

=== Example without Condorcet winner ===. 
In an election with five candidates competing for one seat, the following votes were cast using a [[preferential voting]] method (100 votes with four distinct sets): . 

{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6"
| 31: A>E>C>D>B
| 30: B>A>E
| 29: C>D>B
| 10: D>A>E
|} . 

The results of the 10 possible pairwise comparisons between the candidates are as follows: . 

{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6"
! Comparison
! Result
! Winner
! Comparison
! Result
! Winner
. |-
! A v B
| 41 v 59
| B
! B v D
| 30 v 70
| D
. |-
! A v C
| 71 v 29
| A
! B v E
| 59 v 41
| B
. |-
! A v D
| 61 v 39
| A
! C v D
| 60 v 10
| C
. |-
! A v E
| 71 v 0
| A
! C v E
| 29 v 71
| E
. |-
! B v C
| 30 v 60
| C
! D v E
| 39 v 61
| E
|} . 

No [[Condorcet winner]] (candidate who beats all other candidates in pairwise comparisons) exists.  . 

{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6"
! Candidate
! Wins
! Losses
! Wins - Losses
. |-
! A
| 3
| 1
| 2
. |-
! B
| 2
| 2
| 0
. |-
! C
| 2
| 2
| 0
. |-
! D
| 1
| 3
| -2
. |-
! E
| 2
| 2
| 0
. |-
|} . 

The table above shows the number of wins and losses for each candidate in the pairwise comparisons. Candidate A has the greatest number of wins minus losses, and is therefore the Copeland winner.  . 

As a Condorcet completion method, Copeland requires a [[Smith set]] containing at least five candidates to give a clear winner unless two or more candidates tie in pairwise comparisons.  .
