'''Higher education in the United States''' includes a variety of institutions of [[higher education]]. Strong research and funding have helped make [[United States]] [[college]]s and [[University|universities]] among the world's most prestigious, making them particularly attractive to [[international student]]s, [[professor]]s and [[researcher]]s in the pursuit of academic excellence. According to the [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University|Shanghai Jiao Tong University's]] [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]], more than 30 of the highest-ranked 45 institutions are in the United States (as measured by awards and [[research]] output). <ref>The [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]] [[formula]] was based on alumni winning [[Nobel Prizes]] and [[Fields Medal]]s (10 percent), staff winning Nobel Prizes and Fields Medals (20 percent), "highly-cited researchers in 21 broad subject categories" (20 percent), articles published in the [[Academic journal|journals]] ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' (20 percent), the [[Science Citation Index]], [[Social Sciences Citation Index]], and [[Arts and Humanities Citation Index]] (20 percent) and the size of the institution (10 percent). </ref> [[Public university|Public universities]], [[private university|private universities]], [[liberal arts college]]s, and [[community college]]s all have a significant role in higher education in the United States.  . 

The United States has a total of 4,495 [[Title IV]]-eligible, degree-granting institutions, 2,774 4-year institutions and 1,721 2-year institutions. <ref>http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d10/tables/dt10_275.asp</ref>, an average of more than 115 per state. As of 2010, the US had 20.3 million students in higher education, roughly 5.7% of the total population. <ref>http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=98</ref> About 14.6 million of these students were enrolled full-time. <ref>http://www.census.gov/hhes/school/data/cps/2010/tables.html</ref> . 

The 2006 [[American Community Survey]] conducted by the [[United States Census Bureau]] found that 19.5 percent of the population had attended college but had no [[Academic degree|degree]], 7.4 percent held an [[associate's degree]], 17.1 percent held a [[bachelor's degree]], and 9.9 percent held a [[Postgraduate education|graduate]] or [[professional degree]]. Only a small [[Gender inequality|gender gap]] was present: 27 percent of the overall population held a bachelor's degree or higher, with a slightly larger percentage of men (27.9 percent) than women (26.2 percent). <ref>"[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/STTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=01000US&-qr_name=ACS_2006_EST_G00_S1501&-ds_name=ACS_2006_EST_G00_&-redoLog=false Educational Attainment]."

==Overview==. 
{{See also|List of American institutions of higher education}} . 

The American university system is largely [[Decentralization|decentralized]]. Public universities are administered solely by the individual states. Public universities often have much lower tuition than private universities because subsidies are provided by [[state government]]s. This subsidy averaged $19,220 per student in 2002, when average tuition costs at a public college was $18,273. <ref>[http://www.nber.org/digest/dec03/w9720.html]</ref> . 

American universities developed independent [[Educational accreditation|accreditation organizations]] to vouch for the quality of the degrees they offer. The accreditation agencies rate universities and colleges on criteria such as academic quality&mdash;the quality of their [[Library|libraries]], the publishing records of their [[teacher|faculty]], and the degrees which their faculty hold. Nonaccredited institutions are perceived as lacking in quality and rigor, and may be termed [[diploma mill]]s.  . 

Colleges and universities in the U.S. vary in terms of goals: some may emphasize a [[vocational education|vocational]], [[business]], [[engineering]], or technical curriculum while others may emphasize a [[liberal arts]] curriculum. Many combine some or all of the above.  . 

[[Two-year college]]s (often but not always [[community college]]s) usually offer the [[associate's degree]] such as an [[Associate of Arts]] (A.A.). Community colleges are often [[open admissions]], with generally lower tuition than other state or private schools. Four-year colleges (which usually have a larger number of students and offer a greater range of studies than two-year colleges) offer the [[bachelor's degree]], such as the [[Bachelor of Arts]] (B.A.) or [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.S.). These are usually primarily [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate institutions]], although some might have limited programs at the [[Graduate school|graduate]] level. Many students earn an associate's degree at a two-year institution before [[College transfer|transferring]] to a four-year institution for another two years to earn a bachelor's degree. <ref name=NYT-Frerking-042207>Beth Frerking, [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/education/edlife/bestccs.html Community Colleges: For Achievers, a New Destination], ''The New York Times'', April 22, 2007. </ref> . 

[[File:Alumni Hall 1889 Sun.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Saint Anselm College]], a  [[New England]] liberal arts college]]
Four-year institutions in the U.S. which emphasize the [[liberal arts]] are [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]]. These colleges traditionally emphasize interactive instruction (although research is still a component of these institutions). They are known for being [[Residential college|residential]] and for having smaller enrollment, class size, and higher teacher-student ratios than universities; a typical liberal arts college is pictured on the right. These colleges also encourage a high level of teacher-student interaction at the center of which are classes taught by full-time faculty rather than graduate student [[teaching assistant]]s (TAs), who do teach classes at some [[Research I university|Research I]] and other universities. Most are [[private school|private]], although there are [[Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges|public liberal arts colleges]]. In addition, some offer [[alternative education|experimental curricula]], such as [[Hampshire College]], [[Beloit College]], [[Bard College at Simon's Rock]], [[Pitzer College]], [[Sarah Lawrence College]], [[Grinnell College]], [[Bennington College]], [[New College of Florida]], and [[Reed College]]. 
[[Image:Csuofficeofthechancellor.jpg|thumb|left|[[California State University]], Office of the Chancellor in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[California]]]]
Universities are research-oriented institutions which provide both undergraduate and graduate education. For historical reasons, some universities&mdash;such as [[Boston College]], [[Dartmouth College]], and [[The College of William & Mary]]&mdash;have retained the term "college," while some institutions granting few graduate degrees, such as [[Wesleyan University]], use the term "university." [[Graduate school|Graduate programs]] grant a variety of [[master's degree]]s&mdash;such as the [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]] (M.A.), [[Master of Science]] (M.S.), [[Master of Business Administration]] (M.B.A.), or [[Master of Fine Arts]] (M.F.A.)&mdash;in addition to [[doctorate]]s such as the [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]]. The [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education]] distinguishes among institutions on the basis of the prevalence of degrees they grant and considers the granting of [[master's degree]]s necessary, though not sufficient, for an institution to be classified as a university. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=798|title=Basic Classification Technical Details|publisher=Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|accessdate=2007-03-20}}</ref> . 

Some universities have [[Professional degree|professional schools]], which are attended primarily by those who plan to be practitioners instead of [[Academia|academics]] ([[Scholarly method|scholars]]/[[researcher]]s). Examples include [[journalism school]], [[business school]], [[medical school]]s (which award either the [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]]), [[law school]]s ([[Juris Doctor|J.D.]]), [[veterinary school]]s ([[Doctor of Veterinary Medicine|D.V.M.]]), [[pharmacy school]]s ([[Doctor of Pharmacy|Pharm.D.]]), and [[dental school]]s. A common practice is to refer to different units within universities as ''colleges'' or ''schools'' (what is referred to in other countries as [[Faculty (division)|faculties]]). Some colleges may be divided into ''departments''&ndash;such as an [[anthropology]] department within a college of liberal arts and sciences within a larger university.  .

[[Image:NDU-main-building.jpg|thumb|left|[[University of Notre Dame]]'s historic quad in [[South Bend, Indiana]] with the "Golden Dome" of the administration building visible]]
Except for the [[United States service academies]] and [[staff college]]s, the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] does not directly regulate universities, although it can give [[federal grant]]s to them. The majority of [[Public university|public universities]] are operated by the [[U.S. state|states]] and [[Territories of the United States|territories]], usually as part of a [[state university system]]. Each state supports at least one state university and several support many more. [[California]], for example, has three public higher education systems: the 11-campus [[University of California]], the 23-campus [[California State University]], and the 109-campus [[California Community Colleges System]]. Public universities often have a large student body, with introductory classes numbering in the hundreds and some undergraduate classes taught by graduate students. [[Tribal college]]s operated on [[Indian reservation]]s by some [[federally recognized tribes]] are also public institutions.  . 

Many [[Private university|private universities]] also exist. Among these, some are [[Secularity|secular]] while others are involved in [[religious education]]. Some are [[Non-denominational Christianity|non-denominational]] and some are affiliated with a certain sect or church, such as [[Catholic Church in the United States|Roman Catholicism]] (with different institutions often sponsored by particular [[Roman Catholic religious order|religious orders]] such as the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]) or religions such as [[Lutheranism]] or [[Mormonism]]. [[Seminary|Seminaries]] are private institutions for those preparing to become members of the [[clergy]]. Most private schools (like all public schools) are [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]], although some are [[For-profit school|for-profit]].  . 

[[Tuition]] is charged at almost all American universities, except 1) the five federally sponsored [[United States Service academies|service academies]], in which students attend free and with a [[stipend]] in exchange for a service commitment in the [[Military of the United States|U.S. armed forces]] after graduation; and 2) a few institutions where offering tuition-free education is part of their mission, such as [[Cooper Union]], [[Berea College]], [[Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering|Olin College]] and [[Webb Institute]].  Public universities often have much lower tuition than private universities because funds are provided by [[state government]]s  and residents of the state that supports the university typically pay lower tuition than non-residents. Students often use [[scholarships]], [[student loans]], or [[Grant (money)|grants]], rather than paying all tuition [[Out-of-pocket expenses|out-of-pocket]]. Several states offer [[scholarship]]s that allow students to attend free of tuition or at lesser cost; examples include [[HOPE Scholarship|HOPE]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Bright Futures Scholarship Program|Bright Futures]] in [[Florida]].  . 

Most universities, public and private, have [[Financial endowment|endowments]]. A January 2007 report by the [[National Association of College and University Business Officers]] revealed that the top 765 U.S. colleges and universities had a combined $340 billion in endowment assets as of 2006. The largest endowment is that of [[Harvard University]], at $29 billion. <ref>{{Cite web|  title =NACUBO Endowment Study| month = January | year = 2007 | url= http://www.nacubo.org/documents/research/2006NES_Listing.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> . 

The majority of both liberal arts colleges and public universities are [[coeducation]]al; the number of [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's colleges]] and [[Men's colleges in the United States|men's colleges]] has dwindled in past years and nearly all remaining single-sex institutions are private liberal arts colleges. There are [[historically black colleges and universities]] (HBCUs), both private (such as [[Morehouse College]]) and public (such as [[Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University|Florida A&M]]).  . 

==History==. 
Religious denominations established most early colleges in order to train ministers. In New England there was an emphasis on literacy so that people could read the Bible.  [[Harvard University|Harvard College]] was founded by the colonial legislature in 1636, and named after an early benefactor.  Most of the funding came from the colony, but the college early began to collect endowment.  Harvard at first focused on training young men for the ministry, and won general support from the Puritan colonies. [[The College of William & Mary]] was founded by Virginia government in 1693, with {{convert|20000|acre|km2}} of land for an endowment, and a penny tax on every pound of tobacco, together with an annual appropriation. [[James Blair]], the leading Anglican minister in the colony, was president for 50 years, and the college won the broad support of the Virginia gentry, most of whom were Anglicans, and trained many of the lawyers, politicians, and leading planters.  Students headed for the ministry were given free or in tuition. [[Yale University|Yale College]] was founded in 1701, and in 1716 was relocated to New Haven, Connecticut.  The conservative Puritan ministers of Connecticut had grown dissatisfied with the more liberal theology of Harvard, and wanted their own school to train orthodox ministers.  New Side Presbyterians in 1747 set up the College of New Jersey, in the town of Princeton; much later it was renamed [[Princeton University]].  Rhode Island College was begun by the Baptists in 1764, and in 1804 it was renamed [[Brown University]] in honor of a benefactor.  Brown was especially liberal in welcoming young men from other denominations.  In New York City, the Anglicans set up King's College in 1746, with its president Doctor [[Samuel Johnson (Columbia)|Samuel Johnson]] the only teacher.  It closed during the American Revolution, and reopened in 1784 under the name of Columbia College; it is now [[Columbia University]].  The Academy of Pennsylvania was created in 1749 by [[Benjamin Franklin]] and other civic minded leaders in Philadelphia, and unlike the others was not oriented toward the training of ministers. It was renamed the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1791. the [[Reformed Church in America|Dutch Reform Church]] in 1766 set up Queen's College in New Jersey, which later became [[Rutgers University]].  [[Dartmouth College]], chartered in 1769, grew out of school for Indians, and was moved to its present site in Hanover, New Hampshire, in 1770. <ref>John R. Thelin, ''A History of American Higher Education'' (2004) pp 1-40</ref><ref>Lawrence A. Cremin, ''American Education: The Colonial Experience, 1607–1783''  (1970)</ref> . 

All of the schools were small, with a limited undergraduate curriculum oriented on the liberal arts.  Students were drilled in Greek, Latin, geometry, ancient history, logic, ethics and rhetoric, with few discussions and no lab sessions.  The college president typically enforced strict discipline, and the upperclassman enjoyed hazing the freshman.  Many students were younger than 17, and most of the colleges also operated a preparatory school.  There were no organized sports, or Greek-letter fraternities, but literary societies were active. Tuition was very low and scholarships were few. <ref>Frederick Rudolph, ''The American College and University: A History'' (1991) pp 3-22</ref> . 

There were no schools of law in the colonies.  However, a few lawyers studied at the highly prestigious [[Inns of Court]] in London, while the majority served apprenticeships with established American lawyers. <ref>Anton-Hermann Chroust, ''Rise of the Legal Profession in America'' (1965) vol 1 ch 1-2</ref>  Law was very well established in the colonies, compared to medicine, which was in rudimentary condition.   In the 18th century, 117 Americans had graduated in medicine in Edinburgh, Scotland, but most physicians learned as apprentices in the colonies. <ref>Genevieve Miller, "A Physician in 1776," ''Clio Medica,'' Oct 1976, Vol. 11 Issue 3, pp 135-146</ref> In Philadelphia, the Medical College of Philadelphia was founded in 1765, and became affiliated with the university in 1791.  In New York, the [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons|medical department of King's College]] was established in 1767, and in 1770 awarded the first American M.D. degree. <ref>Jacob Ernest Cooke, ed. ''Encyclopedia of the North American colonies'' (3 vol 1992) 1:214</ref> . 

===Impact of colleges in 19th century===. 
Summarizing the research of Burke and Hall, Katz concludes that in the 19th century:. <ref>Michael Katz, "The Role of American Colleges in the Nineteenth Century," ''History of Education Quarterly,'' Vol. 23, No. 2 (Summer, 1983), pp. 215-223 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/368160 in JSTOR], summarizing Colin B. Burke, ''American Collegiate Populations: A Test of the Traditional View'' (New York University Press, 1982) and Peter Dobkin Hall, ''The Organization of American Culture: Private Institutions, Elites, and the Origins of American Nationality'' (New York University Press, 1982)</ref>
# The nation's many small colleges helped young men make the transition from rural farms to complex urban occupations. 
# These colleges especially promoted upward mobility by preparing ministers, and thereby provided towns across the country with a core of community leaders. 
# The more elite colleges became increasingly exclusive and contributed relatively little to upward social mobility.  By concentrating on the offspring of wealthy families, ministers and a few others, the elite Eastern colleges, especially Harvard, played an important role in the formation of a Northeastern elite with great power.  . 

==="College" versus "university" terminology===. 
[[File:Main Building at The University of Texas at Austin.jpg|thumb|The Main Building on the campus of the [[University of Texas at Austin]]]]
[[File:Ezekiel_W._Cullen_Building_(Alternate).JPG|thumb|[[Ezekiel W. Cullen Building]] on the campus of the [[University of Houston]]]] . 

In the United States, the term [[college]] is frequently used to refer to stand-alone higher level education institutions that are not components of a university as well as to refer to components within a university. Stand-alone institutions that call themselves colleges are universities in the international sense of the term. Typically in the United States, a university is composed of an academically diverse set of units called schools or colleges, whereas a college—whether it is a stand-alone institution of higher learning or a component within a university—typically focuses on one academic sector that is self-chosen by that institution, where that college is composed of departments within that sector. Note that the multiple colleges or schools composing a university are typically collocated on the same university campus or near each other on adjacent campuses within the same metropolitan area. Unlike colleges versus universities in other portions of the world, a stand-alone college is truly stand-alone and is not part of a university, and is also not affiliated with an [[affiliating university]].  . 

Each institution may choose from several different schemes of organization using the terms, in most-macroscopic to most-microscopic order: university, college, school, division, department, and office. To illustrate the finer points of how these terms are used, consider four example institutions:
* [[Purdue University#Colleges and Schools|Purdue University]] is composed of multiple colleges—among others, the College of Agriculture and the College of Engineering. Of these Purdue breaks the College of Agriculture down into departments, such as the Department Agronomy or the Department of Entomology, whereas Purdue breaks down the College of Engineering into schools, such as the School of Electrical Engineering, which enrolls more students than some of its colleges do. As is common in this scheme, Purdue categorizes both its undergraduate students (and faculty and programs) and its post-graduate students (and faculty and programs) via this scheme of decomposition. 
* Compare this to [[Brown University]], which is composed of one college (The College, which is for undergraduates) and two schools (the Graduate School, which is for post-graduate students, and the Medical School, which is for the preparation of medical doctors). 
* Likewise, [[Dartmouth College]] is a stand-alone institution that names itself using the college term, but is organized similarly to [[Brown University]] with undergraduates enrolled in Dartmouth College (directly) and Dartmouth College containing three graduate schools that enroll the post-graduate students: the [[Tuck School of Business]], the [[Thayer School of Engineering]], and [[Dartmouth Medical School]]. 
* Compare this to an entirely-undergraduate liberal-arts college that is a stand-alone institution, [[Carleton College]], which is composed of only the college that contains departments for arts, languages, natural sciences, and physical sciences. Carleton is a pure example of a stand-alone college in the USA sense of the term “college”. Carleton confers no graduate degrees. Carleton has no schools that focus on a non-liberal-arts mission, such as a school of technology or engineering or nursing. Analogous to the Purdue University’s use of the term college, Carleton College is an academic sector composed of related departments that share a common [[liberal-arts]] philosophy of education. Analogous to the Brown and Dartmouth uses of the term college, Carleton College is entirely undergraduate.  . 

In the Purdue University example, a college as a component of the university is a topical decomposition, focused on an academic sector of directly related academic disciplines. In the Brown University example, a college as a component of the university focuses on the undergraduate mission. In the Dartmouth College example of a college as a stand-alone institution, a college focusing on the undergraduate mission is the prevailing but distinct identity of what is arguably a university when the collective of college and schools are considered. In the Carleton College example, the purest example of the USA's use of the term college is displayed in two ways:
* a homogeneous collection of academic-discipline departments that are unified under a common philosophy of education; and
* an undergraduate focus on four-year degrees.  . 

Additionally, a college or university may have [[residential colleges]] as do [[Oxford]], [[Harvard]], and [[Rice University]].

==Admission process==. 
{{Main|College admissions in the United States}}
Students can apply to some colleges using the  [[Common Application]]. There is no limit to the number of colleges or universities to which a student may apply, though an application must be submitted for each. With a few exceptions, most undergraduate colleges and universities maintain the policy that students are to be admitted to (or rejected from) the entire college, not to a particular [[Academic department|department]] or [[academic major|major]]. (This is unlike college admissions in many European countries, as well as graduate admissions.) Some students, rather than being rejected, are "wait-listed" for a particular college and may be admitted if another student who was admitted decides not to attend the college or university. The five major parts of admission are ACT/SAT scores, GPA, College Application, Essay, and Letters of Recommendation. <ref>[http://go-college.webs.com/gettingin.htm US Application Process] 2009</ref> Not all colleges require essays or letters of recommendation, though they are often proven to increase chances of acceptance. 
{{See|College admissions counseling in the United States}} . 

==Rankings==. 
Numerous organizations produce [[Rankings of universities in the United States|rankings of universities]] in the United States each year. A 2010 University of Michigan study has confirmed that the rankings in the United States have significantly affected colleges' applications and admissions. <ref name="umich.edu">Bowman, Nicholas and Michael Bastedo,"Getting on the Front Page: Organizational Reputation, Status Signals, and the Impact of U.S. News and World Report Rankings on Student Decisions."

===2007 movement===. 
{{Main|Criticism of college and university rankings (2007 United States)}} . 

On 19 June 2007, during the annual meeting of the [[Annapolis Group]], members discussed [[Criticism of college and university rankings (North America)#Letter to colleges|the letter to college presidents]] asking them not to participate in the "reputation survey" section of the ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' survey (this section comprises 25% of the ranking). As a result, "a majority of the approximately 80 presidents at the meeting said that they did not intend to participate in the U.S. News reputational rankings in the future." <ref>{{Cite web| first =Scott  | last =Jaschik | title =More Momentum Against ‘U.S. News’| publisher = [[Inside Higher Ed]] | date = 20 June 2007 | url= http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/06/20/usnews}}</ref> However, the decision to fill out the reputational survey or not will be left up to each individual college as: "the Annapolis Group is not a legislative body and any decision about participating in the US News rankings rests with the individual institutions." <ref name="collegenews.org">{{Cite web| first = | last =| title =ANNAPOLIS GROUP STATEMENT ON RANKINGS AND RATINGS|publisher = [[Annapolis Group]] | date = 19 June 2007 | url= http://www.collegenews.org/x7131.xml}}</ref> The statement also said that its members  "have agreed to participate in the development of an alternative common format that presents information about their colleges for students and their families to use in the college search process." <ref name="collegenews.org"/> This database will be web based and developed in conjunction with higher education organizations including the'' [[National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities]]'' and the ''[[Council of Independent Colleges]].'' . 

On 22 June 2007, ''U.S. News and World Report'' editor Robert Morse issued a response in which he argued, "in terms of the peer assessment survey, we at ''U.S. News'' firmly believe the survey has significant value because it allows us to measure the "[[intangibles]]" of a college that we can't measure through [[Statistics|statistical data]]. Plus, the [[reputation]] of a school can help get that all-important first job and plays a key part in which grad school someone will be able to get into. The peer survey is by nature [[Subjectivity|subjective]], but the technique of asking industry leaders to rate their competitors is a commonly accepted practice. The results from the peer survey also can act to level the playing field between [[Private university|private]] and [[Public university|public colleges]]." <ref name="usnews.com">{{Cite web| first =Robert| last = Morse| title =About the Annapolis Group's Statement| publisher = [[U.S. News and World Report]] | date = 22 June 2007 | url= http://www.usnews.com/blogs/college-rankings-blog/2007/6/22/about-the-annapolis-groups-statement.html#read_more}}</ref> In reference to the alternative database discussed by the Annapolis Group, Morse also argued, "It's important to point out that the Annapolis Group's stated goal of presenting college data in a common format has been tried before [...] ''U.S. News'' has been supplying this exact college information for many years already. And it appears that NAICU will be doing it with significantly less comparability and functionality. ''U.S. News'' first collects all these data (using an agreed-upon set of definitions from the Common Data Set). Then we post the data on our website in easily accessible, comparable tables. In other words, the Annapolis Group and the others in the NAICU initiative actually are following the lead of ''U.S. News''." <ref name="usnews.com"/> .

An Ohio University professor and member of the [[Commission on the Future of Higher Education]], has been a vocal critic of how institutions of higher education are financed.

Wright]], tuition costs will continue to rise rapidly without attendant increases in quality until professors are encouraged to own colleges in private partnership, like attorneys and that that won't happen until [[barriers to entry]] are decreased and government education subsidies are paid directly to students instead of to colleges and universities. <ref>Robert E. Wright, ''Fubarnomics: A Lighthearted, Serious Look at America's Economic Ills'' (Buffalo, N.Y.: Prometheus, 2010). </ref> A report in ''[[The Economist]]'' criticized American universities for generally losing sight of how to contain costs. <ref name=twsNovW11/> Second-tier schools with ''Ivy League Envy'' had become "so obsessed with rising up the academic hierarchy" that they focus too much on research while neglecting undergraduate education, and the report chronicled an environment in which universities have been slow to embrace [[Internet]] technology and online software to streamline costs. <ref name=twsNovW11/> . 

Another issue is the rising cost of textbooks. <ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/04/business/yourmoney/04text.html?_r=1&scp=2&sq=textbook%20exchange&st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=Sometimes, It's Not the Tuition.

Lower priced alternatives offered by [[Flat World Knowledge]] are now available but have yet to make a significant impact on overall textbook prices.  . 

Many students lack the financial resources to pay tuition up front and must rely on [[student loan]]s and scholarships from their university, the federal government, or a private lender.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} All but a few charity institutions and the [[United States Service academies]] charge students tuition, although scholarships (both merit-based and need-based) are widely available. Generally, private universities charge much higher tuition than their public counterparts, which rely on state funds to make up the difference. Because each state supports its own university system with state taxes, most public universities charge much higher rates for out-of-state students. In 2002, state governments gave their state colleges a total of $66 billion to partially subsidize students tuition. The average tuition then of a state college was $4,081 annually for a four-year college. The average cost of a private school was $18,273. <ref name="nber">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nber.org/digest/dec03/w9720.html |title=State Education Subsidies Shift Students to Public Universities   |accessdate= |author=Linda Gorman |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2009-12-05 |year= |month= |work=  |publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> .

Annual undergraduate tuition varies widely from state to state, and many additional fees apply. In 2009, average annual tuition at a public university (for residents of the state) was $7,020. <ref name="wp0910222">{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/21/AR2009102103664.html?sub=AR |title=The Color of Money:Getting through college these days almost requires a degree in thrift |accessdate= |author=Michelle Singletary |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2009-10-22 |month=October |work= |publisher=Washington Post |pages=20A |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> Tuition for public school students from outside the state is generally comparable to private school prices, although students can often qualify for state residency after their first year. Private schools are typically much higher, although prices vary widely from "no-frills" private schools to highly specialized technical institutes. Depending upon the type of school and program, annual graduate program tuition can vary from $15,000 to as high as $50,000. Note that these prices do not include living expenses (rent, room/board, etc.) or additional fees that schools add on such as "activities fees" or [[health insurance]]. These fees, especially room and board, can range from $6,000 to $12,000 per academic year (assuming a single student without children). <ref name=collegeboard>[http://www.collegeboard.com/press/article/0,3183,29541,00.html Tuition Levels Rise but Many Students Pay Significantly Less than Published Rates].

College costs are rising at the same time that state appropriations for aid are shrinking. This has led to debate over funding at both the state and local levels. From 2002 to 2004 alone, tuition rates at public schools increased by just over 14 percent, largely due to dwindling state funding. A more moderate increase of 6 percent occurred over the same period for private schools. <ref name=collegeboard>[http://www.collegeboard.com/press/article/0,3183,29541,00.html Tuition Levels Rise but Many Students Pay Significantly Less than Published Rates].

To combat costs colleges have hired [[Adjunct_professor#Adjunct_professor|adjunct professors]] to teach. In 2008 these teachers cost about $1,800 per 3-credit class as opposed to $8,000 per class for a tenured professor. Two-thirds of college instructors were adjuncts. There are differences of opinion whether these adjuncts teach better or worse than regular professors. There is a suspicion that student evaluation of adjuncts, along with their subsequent continued employment, can lead to [[grade inflation]]. <ref>{{Cite book| author = Clark, Kim |title = Does it Matter That Your Professor Is Part Time? | publisher = US News and World Report | date = November 17–24, 2008}}</ref> . 

[[Princeton University|Princeton]] sociologists Thomas Espenshade and Alexandria Walton Radford published a book-length study of admissions that found that an upper-middle-class white applicant was three times more likely to be admitted to an American college than a lower-class white with similar qualification.

==Government coordination==. 
Every state has an entity designed to promote coordination and collaboration between higher education institutions. A few are listed: .

*[[California Postsecondary Education Commission]]
*[[Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board]]
*[[Washington State Higher Education Coordinating Board]]
*[[The Georgia Department of Technical and Adult Education]] . 

===Academic employment=== . 

In the 1980s and 1990s significant changes in the economics of academic life began to be felt, identified by some as a catastrophe in the making and by others as a new era with potentially huge gains for the university. Some critics identified the changes as a new "[[corporatization]] of the university." Academic jobs have been traditionally viewed by many intellectuals as desirable, because of the [[wikt:autonomy|autonomy]] and intellectual freedom they allow (especially because of the [[tenure]] system), despite their low pay compared to other professions requiring extensive education. And until the mid-1970s, when federal expenditures for higher education fell sharply, there were routinely more tenure-track jobs than Ph.D. graduates.  . 

Now, by contrast, despite rising tuition rates and growing university revenues (especially in the U.S.) well-paid professorial positions are rarer, replaced with poorly paid [[Professors in the United States|adjunct]] positions and graduate-student labor. People with doctorates in the sciences, and to a lesser extent mathematics, often find jobs outside of academia (or use part-time work in industry to supplement their incomes), but a Ph.D. in the humanities and many social sciences prepares the student primarily for academic employment. However, in recent years a large proportion of such Ph.D.s—ranging from 30 percent to 60 percent—have been unable to obtain tenure-track jobs. They must choose between adjunct positions, which are poorly paid and lack job security; teaching jobs in community colleges or in high schools, where little research is done; the non-academic job market, where they will tend to be overqualified; or some other course of study, such as law or business.  . 

Indeed, with academic institutions producing Ph.D.s in greater numbers than the number of tenure-track professorial positions they intend to create, there is little question that administrators are cognizant of the economic effects of this arrangement. The sociologist [[Stanley Aronowitz]] wrote: "Basking in the plenitude of qualified and credentialed instructors, many university administrators see the time when they can once again make tenure a rare privilege, awarded only to the most faithful and to those whose services are in great demand". <ref>Aronowitz, Stanley. ''The Knowledge Factory: Dismantling the Corporate University and Creating True Higher Learning'', p. 76. ISBN 0-8070-3123-2. </ref> . 

Most people who are knowledgeable of the academic job market advise prospective graduate students not to attend graduate school if they must pay for it; graduate students who are admitted without tuition remission and a reasonable stipend are forced to incur large debts that they will be unlikely to repay quickly. In addition, most people recommend that students obtain full and accurate information about the placement record of the programs they are considering. At some programs, most Ph.D.s get multiple tenure-track offers, whereas at others few obtain any; such information is clearly very useful in deciding what to do with the next 5–7 years of one's life.  . 

Some believe that, as a number of [[Baby Boomer]] professors retire, the [[academic job market]] will rebound. However, others predict that this will not result in an appreciable growth of tenure-track positions, as universities will merely fill their needs with low-paid adjunct positions. Aronowitz ascribed this problem to the economic restructuring of academia as a whole: . 

{{quote|In fact, the program of restructuring on university campuses, which entails reducing full-time tenure-track positions in favor of part-time, temporary, and contingent jobs, has literally "fabricated" this situation. The idea of an academic "job market" based on the balance of supply and demand in an open competitive arena is a fiction whose effect is to persuade the candidate that (he or she) simply lost out because of bad luck or lack of talent. The truth is otherwise. <ref>Aronowitz, ''The Knowledge Factory'' 75-76. </ref>}} . 

The effects of a growing pool of unemployed, underemployed, and undesirably employed Ph.D.s on many countries' economies as a whole is undetermined.  .

==Access to higher education==. 
===Funding===. 
The portion of state budget funding spent on higher education has decreased by 40 percent since 1978, while at the same time most tuition fees have significantly increased. <ref name=”chen”> Chen, R., & St. John, E. P. (2011). State Financial Policies and College Student Persistence: A National Study. Journal Of Higher Education, 82(5), 629-660. </ref> Between 2000 and 2010, the cost of tuition and room and board at [[public universities]] increased by 37 percent. <ref name="FastFacts76"> Fast facts [Fact Sheet]. (n.d.). Retrieved from Institute of Education Sciences website: http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=76</ref> During the early 1980’s, higher education funding saw a shift from reliance on state and federal government funding, to a greater reliance on family contributions and [[student loans]].  [[Pell Grants]], which were created to offset the cost of college for low-income students, started funding more middle-class students, stretching the funds thinner for everyone.  During the mid-1990’s only 34 percent of the cost for college was covered by the maximum offered Pell Grant, compared to 84 percent during the 1970’s. <ref name=”investing”> Clinedinst, M.

Retrieved from Institute for Higher Education Policy website: http://www.ihep.org/assets/files/publications/g-l/InvestingAmerica.pdf</ref>  . 

The federal government also began funding less grant programs and more loan programs, leaving students with higher amounts of debt. In 2003, almost 70 percent of federal [[student aid]] awarded was student loans, which was a much higher percentage than just a decade before. <ref name=”investing”> Clinedinst, M. (2005, May).

}}</ref> Furthermore, the economic troubles of the recent decade has left higher education funding being shifted towards other needs because higher education institutions have the ability to gain extra funds through raising tuition and private donations. <ref name=”politics”>Tandberg, D. (2010). Politics, Interest Groups and State Funding of Public Higher Education. Research In Higher Education, 51(5), 416-450. doi:10.1007/s11162-010-9164-5</ref> . 

Policy changes in higher education funding raise questions about the impact on student performance and access to higher education. Many early studies focused on social integration and a person’s individual attributes as the factors for degree completion. <ref name=”chen”> Chen, R., & St. John, E. P. (2011). State Financial Policies and College Student Persistence: A National Study. Journal Of Higher Education, 82(5), 629-660. </ref> More recent studies have begun to look at larger factors including state funding and financial support.It has been found that providing [[need-based aid]] proved to increase degree completion in 48 states.There has also been a positive correlation between providing [[merit-based aid]] and degree completion. <ref name=”chen”> Chen, R., & St. John, E. P. (2011). State Financial Policies and College Student Persistence: A National Study. Journal Of Higher Education, 82(5), 629-660. </ref> Also, as the level to qualify for state need-based aid is lowered, the probability of persistence increases.  Low-income families now have to pay more to attend college, making it harder for such populations to attain higher education.  In 1980, low-income families had to use 13 percent of their income to pay for one year of college.  In 2000, this proportion grew to 25 percent of their income, while high-income families use less than 5 percent of their income. <ref name=”investing”> Clinedinst, M. (2005, May). Investing in America’s future: Why student aid pays off for society and individuals (Policy Report). Retrieved from Institute for Higher Education Policy website: http://www.ihep.org/assets/files/publications/g-l/InvestingAmerica.pdf</ref> . 

Most discussions on how higher education funding is determined have focused on the economic and demographic influences; however, according to a 2010 study on the relationship between politics and state funding many political factors influence higher education funding.  First, as the number of interest groups for higher education in a state grows, so does the amount of money given to higher education.  Second, states with a more liberal political ideology give more funding to higher education.  Third, governors with more control over the state budget tend to award less money to higher education.  This is attributed again to the fact that higher education funding is considered to be tradable with other programs.  Fourth, a more professional [[state legislature]] correlates with more funding for higher education.  Professional in this situation is referring to a legislature that acts similarly to the [[U.S. Congress]] in terms of having a large amount of staff members and spending more time in session.  Fifth, the more diverse a state population becomes, the less support there will be for higher education funding. <ref name=”politics”>Tandberg, D. (2010). Politics, Interest Groups and State Funding of Public Higher Education. Research In Higher Education, 51(5), 416-450. doi:10.1007/s11162-010-9164-5</ref> . 

===Socioeconomic status===. 
Different societal factors such as [[socioeconomic status]] can play a part in one’s chances of taking advantage of higher education.  A 2011 national study found that college students with a high socioeconomic status persisted in college 25 percent more than students with a low socioeconomic status. <ref name=”chen”> Chen, R., & St. John, E. P. (2011). State Financial Policies and College Student Persistence: A National Study. Journal Of Higher Education, 82(5), 629-660. </ref> In fact, students with a high socioeconomic status are 1.55 times more likely to persist in college than students with a low socioeconomic status.  A 2007 study found that only 52 percent of low-income students who qualified for [[college]] enrolled within 2 years of graduation compared to 83 percent of high-income students.  <ref name=”rowan”> Rowan-Kenyon, H. T. (2007). Predictors of Delayed College Enrollment and the Impact of Socioeconomic Status. Journal Of Higher Education, 78(2), 188-214.  </ref> Attaining even higher degrees than a [[bachelor’s degree]] can also be affected by socioeconomic status.  A 2008 study reports that only 11 percent of students with low socioeconomic status report earning a master’s, medical, or [[law degree]] compared to 42 percent of high socioeconomic students.  <ref name=”pipeline”> M. (2008). Emerging from the Pipeline: African American Students, Socioeconomic Status, and College Experiences and Outcomes. Research In Higher Education, 49(3), 237-255. doi:10.1007/s11162-007-9079-y
</ref> . 

Socioeconomic status can also affect which populations begin higher education after high school graduation.  The [[National Center for Education Statistics]] reports that in 2009 high school graduates from low-income families enrolled in college immediately at a rate of 55 percent.  In comparison, 84 percent of high school graduates from high-income families enrolled immediately into college.  Middle-class families also saw lower rates with 67 percent enrolling in college immediately. <ref name=”condition”> Aud, S., Hussar, W., Kena, G., Bianco, K., Frohlich, L., Kemp, J., Tahan, K. (2011). The Condition of Education 2011 (NCES 2011-033). U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics. Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office. </ref> As the level of [[socioeconomic status]] increases, so does the likelihood that the student will enroll in college at some point.   It also found that a high percentage of students who delayed enrollment in college attended high schools that had a high level of participation in the [[free and reduced lunch program]].  Furthermore, students who had access to financial aid contacts were more likely to enroll in higher education than students who did not have these contacts. <ref name=”rowan”> Rowan-Kenyon, H. T. (2007). Predictors of Delayed College Enrollment and the Impact of Socioeconomic Status. Journal Of Higher Education, 78(2), 188-214.  </ref> . 

Socioeconomic status can also influence performance rates once at a university.  According to a 2008 study, students with a low socioeconomic status study less, work more hours, have less interaction with faculty, and are less likely to join [[extra-curricular clubs]] and groups.   42 percent of students with low socioeconomic status indicated that they worked more than 16 hours a week during school, with a high percentage working up to 40 hours a week. <ref>Walpole, M. (2008). Emerging from the Pipeline: African American Students, Socioeconomic Status, and College Experiences and Outcomes. Research In Higher Education, 49(3), 237-255. doi:10.1007/s11162-007-9079-y</ref> . 

This is also evidence of a positive relation between socioeconomic status and social integration at university. In other words, middle-class students take part in more formal and informal social activities and have a greater sense of belonging to their universities than do working-class students. <ref>Rubin, M. (2012). Social class differences in social integration among students in higher education: A meta-analysis and recommendations for future research. Journal of Diversity in Higher Education, 5, 22-38. http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0026162</ref> . 

===Race=== 
[[Race (classification of humans)|Race]] can also play a part in a student’s persistence rate in college.  Drop out rates are highest with the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and [[African American]] population, both with drop out rates greater than 50 percent. <ref name=”chen”> Chen, R., & St. John, E. P. (2011). State Financial Policies and College Student Persistence: A National Study. Journal Of Higher Education, 82(5), 629-660. </ref> Caucasians and Asian Americans had the lowest dropout rates. Race can also play a part in which students even enroll in college.  A 2007 study found that African Americans are more likely to delay enrolling in college. <ref name=”rowan”> Rowan-Kenyon, H. T. (2007). Predictors of Delayed College Enrollment and the Impact of Socioeconomic Status. Journal Of Higher Education, 78(2), 188-214.  </ref> The [[National Center for Education Statistics]] reports that between 2003 and 2009 rates of immediate college enrollment increased for [[Asian Americans]] and [[White American|whites]], but not for African Americans <ref name=”condition”> Aud, S., Hussar, W., Kena, G., Bianco, K., Frohlich, L., Kemp, J., Tahan, K.

===Unauthorized immigrants===. 
It is estimated that 65,000 [[Illegal immigration to the United States|unauthorized immigrants]] graduate from high school each year.  These graduates have lived in the United States for more than 5 years and most were often brought to the United States by their parents as young children. <ref name=”unc”> Zota, S. (2009, Spring/Summer). Unauthorized immigrants’ access to higher education: fifty states, different direction. Popular Government, 74(3), 46-54. Retrieved from http://sogpubs.unc.edu/electronicversions/pg/pgspsm09/article7.pdf
</ref> This leaves the U.S. Government with the question of what rights to give the unauthorized immigrants after their graduation, particularly with access to higher education. A 2010 study conducted at the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] (UNLV) on unauthorized immigrants and higher education:
<blockquote>Installing pathways to higher education and in-state tuition for undocumented students in the United States presents both opportunities and constraints in developing practices that promote [[social justice]], [[equity]], and [[equality]]. Those who are sympathetic to the challenges facing undocumented students may support opportunities to promote the potential of those who are deserving of incorporation and membership in U.S. society. On the other hand, proponents of tighter borders and tougher immigration laws may view all undocumented people, including model, hardworking young people, as “illegals” or temporary workers and consider them to be drains on the resources of society. This puts educational administrators in precarious positions since they are professionals who are trained to promote and support students in their pursuit of knowledge and self-improvement. Therefore, many professionals are left with little choice but to search for individuals and resources already established within outlaw cultures.” <ref name=”outlaws”> Harmon, C., Carne, G., Lizardy-Hajbi, K., & Wilkerson, E. (2010, April 1). Access to higher education for undocumented students: “Outlaws” of social justice, equity, and equality. Journal of Praxis in Multicultural Education, 5(1), 67-82. Retrieved from http://digitalcommons.library.unlv.edu/jpme/vol5/iss1/9/ </ref> </blockquote> . 

In 1996, the United States passed a law banning states from offering residency benefits to unauthorized immigrants that they didn’t then also offer to every [[U.S. citizen]].  This basically made it so that states could not offer in-state tuition to unauthorized immigrants, even if they technically qualified based on residency status. States have argued the clarity of this law and many have enacted their own laws allowing in-state tuition to be given on the claims that it’s based on high school attendance and not explicitly residency. <ref name=”unc”> Zota, S.

The [[Dream Act]] was introduced in 2001 and aims to give more access to higher education for unauthorized immigrants by repealing the law 1996 law.  It also aimed to set up pathways for students who obtain higher education to become [[legal residents]].  The act has been introduced in many states and many different times, but has still not been passed.  Critics of the act argue that it encourages more illegal immigration, that schools will engage in [[grade inflation]] so that border-line students can take advantage of the act, and that a financial burden could be placed on taxpayers. Proponents argue the opposite, emphasizing that giving the unauthorized immigrants an opportunity at higher education means they will be more self-sufficient in the future, contributing more to taxes and relying less on state resources.  They also claim that children should not be punished for the actions of their parents and that giving them this opportunity would encourage them to be contributing and law abiding citizens.  Whether this act would have positive effects on unauthorized immigrants attending college is still hard to see since not many states have actually done it and the time span has not been enough for thorough research. <ref name=”unc”> Zota, S.

The 2010 UNLV study recommends key policy changes to support unauthorized immigrants access to higher education.  
<blockquote> In general, practitioners need to weigh opportunities against constraints and consider the potential opportunities to promote social justice, equality, and equity in higher education access. Rather than considering undocumented students as “illegals” and restricting their access to legitimate educational pathways, it is recommended that, at the very least, those in positions of power adopt an outlaw cultural framework to support the strengths inherent within diversity as well as pursue avenues of social justice for undocumented students who are seeking to access higher education to improve their future and secure permanent membership in U.S. society. <ref name=”outlaws”> Harmon, C., Carne, G., Lizardy-Hajbi, K., & Wilkerson, E.

==Issues of debate==. 
===Students going into debt for low-value degrees===. 
Although [[academic degree]]s usually lead to more lucrative careers than [[associate degree]]s from [[Community colleges in the United States|community college]]s, that tendency varies among the different majors. <ref>{{cite web| last =Fowler| first =Janet| title =Eight High Paying Jobs That Require 2-Year Degrees| work =Investopedia| date =26 August 2011| url =http://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0811/8-High-Paying-Jobs-That-Require-2-Year-Degrees.aspx#axzz1okK92tK0| accessdate =10 March 2012}}</ref> [[Georgetown University]]'s ''Center on Education and the Workforce'' has released a study which essentially claims that colleges are not informing [[freshman|freshmen]] about the career prospects of various [[academic major]]s, thereby training many students for low-paying careers with a substantial risk of unemployment and intractable debt problems. <ref>{{Cite web| last = Carnevale| first = Anthony| coauthors = Jeff Strohl & Michelle Melton| title = What's It Worth: The Economic Value of College Majors| publisher = Georgetown University| date = 24 May 2011| url = http://cew.georgetown.edu/whatsitworth/| accessdate = 11 July 2011}}</ref> For example, majors in [[engineering]], [[Administration of business|business administration]], [[health care]], [[computer science]] and [[mathematics]] usually lead to well-paid and secure jobs.  On the other hand, majors in [[psychology]], [[social work]], [[the arts]], [[education]], [[communication studies|communication]], [[journalism]], the [[humanities]] and [[liberal arts]], result in too many graduates competing for available job opportunities.  Even if they do get jobs, they are often vulnerable to [[layoffs]].  . 

===For-profit schools===. 
There has been rapid growth in recent years of [[for-profit school]]s, of which the [[University of Phoenix]] is the largest with an enrollment over 400,000 nationwide.  Other large institutions, with numerous branch campuses and online programs include Devry and Kaplan University. Altogether, they enroll 9% of the students. They have aggressively recruited among military veterans, and in 2010 received 36% percent of all the tuition aid paid by the federal government. The University of Phoenix received 88% of its income from federal aid to students; the maximum allowed is 90%.  In 2001 the University of Phoenix  opened a two-year online program oriented toward lower-income students who receive federal financial aid; in 2010 it had over 200,000 students seeking two-year degrees.  Critics have pointed to the heavy dependence on federal loans and grants to students, the low student completion rate, and the inability of the majority of graduates to pay their student loans because they failed to secure high-paying jobs. <ref>John Lauerman and Esmé E. Deprez, "Apollo, Education Shares Plunge on Enrollment Outlook" [http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-10-14/apollo-education-shares-plunge-on-enrollment-outlook.html ''Bloomberg'' Oct. 14, 2010]</ref> The University of Phoenix reports that in 2009, 23% of its students completed an associate degree within three years of enrolling, and for bachelor’s degree students, its six-year completion rate was 34%. <ref>Goldie Blumenstyk, "U. of Phoenix Reports on Students’ Academic Progress," [http://chronicle.com/blogs/measuring/u-of-phoenix-reports-on-students-academic-progress/27584 ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' Dec. 9, 2010]</ref> . 

The amount of debt that students have after graduation has become an issue of concern, especially given the weak job market after 2008. <ref>http://www.wbur.org/2010/05/26/student-loans-iii</ref>  Some loans are financed by the federal government, but students sometimes obtain private loans (which generally have higher interest rates and start accumulating interest immediately).  In 2010, the [[U.S. Department of Education]] announced stricter eligibility rules for federal financing of loans to student at [[for-profit school]]s, which were experiencing higher default rates. <ref>http://www.citytowninfo.com/career-and-education-news/articles/department-of-education-puts-restrictions-on-for-profit-college-student-debt-10072601</ref> . 

===Political views===. 
Research since the 1970s have consistently found that professors are  more [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] than the general population. <ref>Everett Carll Ladd and Seymour Martin Lipset, ''Academics, politics, and the 1972 election'' (1973)</ref><ref>Jack H. Schuster and Martin J. Finkelstein, ''The American Faculty: The Restructuring of Academic Work and Careers'' (2008) p. 145</ref><ref>Louis Menand, ''The Marketplace of Ideas: Reform and Resistance in the American University'' (2010) pp 137-9</ref>  Surveys conducted in the last 10 years indicate that between 44%-62% faculty self-identify as liberal, while 9%-18% self-identify as conservative.  Conservative self-identification is higher in two-year colleges than other categories of higher education but has been declining overall. <ref name=pcu2009>{{cite book|last=Maranto, Redding, Hess|title=The Politically Correct University: Problems, Scope, and Reforms|year=2009|publisher=The AEI Press|isbn=978-0-8447-4317-2|pages=25–27|url=http://www.aei.org/docLib/9780844743172.pdf}}</ref>  Those in natural sciences, engineering, and business were less liberal than  those in the social sciences and humanities. A 2005 study found that liberal views had  increased compared to the older studies. 15% in the survey described themselves as  right of center. While the [[humanities]] and the [[social sciences]] are still the most left leaning,  67% of those in other fields combined described themselves as [[Left-right politics|left of center]]. In  business and engineering, liberals outnumber conservatives by a 2:1 ratio. The study also found that women, practicing Christians, and Republicans taught at lower quality schools{{Clarify|what is meant by "lower quality" sounds pov without some criteria for measurement|date=February 2012}}  than would be expected from objectively measured professional accomplishments. <ref>{{cite doi|10.2202/1540-8884.1067}}</ref><ref>College Faculties A Most Liberal Lot, Study Finds, Howard Kurtz, Tuesday, March 29, 2005 Washington Post http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A8427-2005Mar28.html</ref> One critic has suggested that "[[Groupthink]]" explains why liberals appear to be overrepresented. <ref>"Groupthink in Academia: Majoritarian Departmental Politics and the  Professional Pyramid." Pp. 79–98 in The Politically Correct University: Problems, Scope,  and Reforms, edited by Robert Maranto, Richard Redding, and Frederick Hess. Washington, DC:  AEI Press. </ref> . 

A 2007 study criticized some recent surveys, such as the above 2005 study, on methodological grounds as well as being motivated by conservative concerns. It also pointed to the influence of conservative [[think tank]]s outside academia. In its own survey it found that while conservatives were rare, there was a large centrist group between those self-identifying as liberals or conservatives. More moderate views were more common in younger professors, although also in this age group liberals were several times more common than conservatives. The age group with most liberal  professors were the professors who were teenagers or young adults in the radical 1960s. Of all surveyed, 3% identified themselves as [[Marxist]]s with the highest numbers being in social sciences (17%) and humanities (5%). <ref>Neil Gross and Solon Simmons, “The Social and Political  Views of American Professors” (paper presented at the Harvard University Symposium on  Professors and Their Politics, Cambridge, MA, October 6, 2007). </ref><ref>The ’60s Begin to Fade as Liberal Professors Retire, Patricia Cohen, July 3, 2008, New York Times, http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/03/arts/03camp.html?pagewanted=all</ref> . 

A 2011 study disagreed with younger professors being more moderate and instead argued that the average view may shift further left in the future. The study also found that the years of college education had  little effect on the political view of undergraduates. There was little evidence that right  leaning professors were treated poorly. However, they may have difficulty publishing with a cited study finding that out of 494 books published by [[Harvard University Press]] eight were conservative or classical liberal in orientation. Regarding the cause of the apparent liberal overrepresentation, it found that conservative students preferred to major in fields leading to immediate employment, such as hotel management or accounting, rather than further studies. <ref>The Still Divided Academy: How Competing Visions of Power, Politics,  and Diversity Complicate the Mission of Higher Education, Stanley Rothman, April Kelly- Woessner , Matthew Woessner, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2011. </ref><ref>Five myths about liberal academia, Matthew Woessner, April Kelly-Woessner and Stanley Rothman Friday, February 25, 2011 Washtington Post http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/25/AR2011022503169.html </ref> Self-selection has also been suggested by others as the main explanation. <ref>Diversity in American Higher Education: Toward a More Comprehensive Approach,  Lisa Stulberg and Sharon Weinberg, eds, 2011, Routledge.

In one study the researchers sent out e-mails to graduate studies directors at top ranked departments. They claimed to be an [[undergraduate]] asking for guidance regarding if this was a suitable department. The e-mails differed regarding which presidential campaign the undergraduate had worked for. There was no statical difference in the replies. On the other hand, a survey of [[sociology]] professors found that one quarter stated that they would be more likely to vote for hiring a declared Democrat and less likely to vote for hiring a declared [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. Around 40% stated that they would be less likely to vote for hiring an [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] or a member of the [[National Rifle Association]]. Another survey found a similar situation for humanities and other social sciences professors. <ref>The Left-Leaning Tower, John Tierny, The New York Times, July 22, 2011, http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/education/edl-24notebook-t.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all</ref>{{Synthesis-inline|date=August 2011}} .

A 2007 poll found that 58% of Americans thought that college professors' political bias was a "serious problem". This varied depending on the political views of those asked. 91% of "very conservative" adults agreed compared with only 3% of liberals. <ref>Zogby Poll: Most Think Political Bias Among College Professors a Serious Problem, Jul 10, 2007, http://www.zogby.com/news/2007/07/10/zogby-poll-most-think-political-bias-among-college-professors-a-serious-problem/</ref> .
