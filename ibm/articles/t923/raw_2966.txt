'''Private universities''' are [[University|universities]] not operated by governments, although many receive public [[subsidies]], especially in the form of [[tax breaks]] and public [[student loans]] and [[grant (money)|grant]]s. Depending on their location, private universities may be subject to government regulation. This is in contrast to [[public university|public universities]] and [[national university|national universities]]. While many prominent private universities are run by charitable or [[non-profit organization]]s, a subset are commercial [[For-profit school|for-profit universities]] which are run as business organizations.  .

=== China ===. 
Since 2003, joint-partnership private universities have been established in the People's Republic of China(PRC).  English is the only language of instruction in all three institutions.  . 

* [[University of Nottingham Ningbo, China]] (UNNC) in Ningbo, Zhejiang
* [[United International College]] (UIC) in Zhuhai, Guangdong
* [[Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University]] (XJTLU) in Suzhou, Jiangsu . 

=== Taiwan ===. 
In Taiwan (ROC), unlike the United States, private universities are typically not as prestigious as public (national) universities. They aren't as highly ranked as public institutions, and also cost nearly twice as much. This is due to the form of testing in schools in Taiwan, in which students take a national entrance exam to determine their university qualifications. Thus, those who are unable to test-pass into the national schools (which are the best) are forced to attend private institutions. The famous private university is [[Fu Jen Catholic University]], and the earliest is [[Tunghai University]].  .

=== Pakistan === . 

{{Main|Higher Education Commission of Pakistan}}
The Higher Education Commission (HEC), formerly the University Grant Commission, is the primary regulator of higher education in Pakistan. It also facilitates the development of higher educational system in Pakistan. Its main purpose is to upgrade the  to be world-class centres of education, research and development.  . 

The HEC is also playing a leading role towards building a knowledge-based economy in Pakistan by giving out hundreds of doctoral scholarships for education abroad every year. 
In spite of the criticism of HEC, its creation has also had a positive impact on higher education in Pakistan. In their two year report for 2004 to 2006 it is mentioned that according to the Institute of Scientific Information, the total number of publications appearing in the 8,000 leading journals indexed in the web of Science arising out of Pakistan in 2005 was 1,259 articles, representing a 41% increase over the past two years and a 60% increase since the establishment of HEC in 2002. In addition the HEC digital library now provides access to over 20,000 leading research journals, covering about 75% of the world's peer reviewed scientific journals.  . 

Until 1991, there were only two recognized private universities in Pakistan: [[Aga Khan University]] established in 1983; and [[Lahore University of Management Sciences]] established in 1985. By 1997, however, there were 10 private universities and in 2001-2002, this number had doubled to 20; among the first to gain degree awarding status was [[Hajvery University, Lahore]](HU), established in 1990. In 2003-2004 Pakistan had a total of 83 private degree granting institutions.  . 

The HEC website also points to a 40% increase in enrollment in universities in Pakistan over the last two years, which it attributes to efforts on its part to encourage higher education in the country.  .

===Philippines===. 
{{See also|Higher education in the Philippines}} . 

Private colleges and universities may either be "sectarian" or "non-sectarian" entities. Institutions may be not-for-profit, or profit-oriented. Most private schools are not-for-profit Catholic like Adamson University (Vincentian), Ateneo de Manila University (Jesuit), Colegio de San Juan de Letran (Dominican), De La Salle University (Christian Brothers), Don Bosco Technical College (Salesian), Saint Louis University, Baguio City (CICM), San Beda College (Benedictine), University of San Carlos (SVD), and the University of Santo Tomas (Dominican). However, there are also non-Catholic not-for-profit sectarian institutions such as Silliman University (Presbyterian), Trinity University of Asia (Anglican), Philippine Christian University (Methodist), Adventist University of the Philippines (Seventh-day Adventists), and New Era University (Iglesia ni Cristo). Non-sectarian private schools, on the other hand, are corporations licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Two are registered on the Philippine Stock Exchange like Far Eastern University, and Centro Escolar University.  . 

===Singapore===. 
[[SIM University]] (UniSIM) is the first and only full-fledged private university in [[Singapore]]. It is established in 2005 with the approval of Singapore's Ministry of Education (MOE) to award recognised Singapore degrees. Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents studying for their first degree in UniSIM are eligible for up to 55% fee subsidy from the Singapore Government. There are four degree-awarding schools in UniSIM, i.e. the School of Arts & Social Sciences, the School of Business, the School of Human Development & Social Services, and the School of Science & Technology. As of early 2012, the student enrollment stood at approximately 12,000.  . 

===Sri Lanka===. 
In [[Sri Lanka]] there are no private universities, however there are several independent institutions that are non-government funded. These mostly provide undergraduate degrees with a limited few proving postgraduate degrees. The Informatics Institute of Sri Lanka (IIT) [http://www.iit.ac.lk] and Sri Lanka Institute for Information Technology (SLIT) [http://www.sliit.lk] are examples. A reasonable number of foreign Universities franchise some parts of their degree courses in Sri Lanka with local institutes. Students are charged for the study (some of these Universities are state funded institutions of their home countries) and these charges are often a fraction of the cost studying in the home countries of these institutions.  . 

Efforts to establish Private Universities have been blocked due to protests from state universities' undergraduates and leftist political parties.  . 

However Minister to High Education Mr.S.B.Dissanayaka has emphasized that 15 no's of foreign private Universities and Technical Institutes will be established in SriLanka immediatlely and he further mentioned that private education will bring foreign exchange to the Country. He stated these while he was addressing a gathering at Central Provience.  . 

===Vietnam===. 
Since the 1990s a lot of private universities have opened in Vietnam.  Hochiminh City Open University  was one of the first universities in this category in the higher education system in Vietnam. Typical characteristics of Vietnamese private universities {{as of | 2010 | lc = on}} are higher (very high in some cases) tuition fees, poor infrastructure, and limited faculty and human resources. The private universities are often named after scholars (Vo Truong Toan University, [[Nguyen Trai]] University, Luong The Vinh University, Chu Van A University, [[Yersin]] University, [[Phan Chau Trinh]] University, etc.), or heroes/legends ([[Hung Vuong]] University, [[Quang Trung]] University, etc.), although there are exceptions, such as [[FPT University]] named after the [[FPT Group]] and [[Tan Tao University]] in [[Tan Tao Group]]. In Vietnam, there exists the "Semi-private university"; universities in this category can partly receive financial support from the government. Almost private universities have to invite professors and lecturers from the state universities. Many retired lecturers from state-owned universities take up positions in private universities after their retirement.  . 

==Europe==. 
=== Austria ===. 
In [[Austria]], educational institutions must be authorised by the country to legally grant [[academic degree]]s. All state-run universities are governed by the 2002 Austrian Universities' and University Degree Programmes' Organisation Act (Federal Law Gazette No. 120/2002). In 1999, a federal law (''Universitäts-Akkreditierungsgesetz'') was passed to allow the [[School accreditation|accreditation]] of private universities. The ''Akkreditierungsrat'' (Accreditation Council){{#tag:ref|,[http://www.akkreditierungsrat.at/ Official website]|group="note"}} evaluates applicants and issues recommendations to the responsible Austrian accreditation authority (the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science & Research).  . 

Accreditation by the council yields a couple of privileges: [[Grade (education)|Academic grades]] issued by accredited private universities have the same legal status as those issued by state-run universities. Private universities can appoint or promote [[professor]]s. Their students enjoy the same privileges pertaining social security, foreigner law and state scholarships as students of the state universities. Private Educational services of private universities are not subject to [[value added tax]], and donations are tax deductible.  . 

Accreditations must be renewed regularly and can be withdrawn, e.g. in the case of repeated academic misconduct as happened in 2003 where the accreditation of [[International University Vienna]], was withdrawn. In 2006, when the accreditation of [[IMADEC University]] expired, the Accreditation Council rejected requests for renewal.  . 

Austrian law provides that private universities in Austria must use the term ''Privatuniversität'' (literally, "private university") in their [[German language|German]] names, although their formal names in other languages, e.g. in [[English language|English]], are not regulated. Thus, there is the possibility of private institutions employing the term "university" as opposed to "private university" in their advertisements in all languages except German while still complying with Austrian law.  . 

While the legal definition of "private university" prohibits funding by the federal government of Austria, funding by other public bodies is not prohibited. Consequently, some of Austria's private universities are funded or partly funded by provincial governments, while others are fully private funded.  . 

Accreditation of private universities started in 2001. {{As of | 2010}} Austria has 13 private universities. Most of them are small (fewer than 1000 students) and specialise in only one or two fields of study: . 

* [[Anton Bruckner Private University for Music, Drama, and Dance]] in [[Linz]]
* [[Catholic-Theological Private University Linz]]
* Danube Private University in [[Krems an der Donau]]
* [[European Peace University]] in [[Stadtschlaining]]
* [[Konservatorium Wien]] in [[Vienna]]
* [[MODUL University Vienna]] (2007)
* [[New Design University]] in [[St. Pölten]]
* Paracelsus Medizinische Privatuniversität in [[Salzburg]]
* [[PEF Private University of Management Vienna]] in [[Vienna]] and [[Graz]]
* Privatuniversität Schloss Seeburgin Seekirchen (near Salzburg)
* University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics and Technology in [[Hall in Tirol]]
* [[Sigmund Freud University Vienna]]
* [[Webster University Vienna]] (also accredited in the [[USA]])
Three former private universities are '''not accredited''' any more:
* [[International University Vienna]]: Accreditation was withdrawn in 2003 due to academic misconduct. 
* [[IMADEC University]]: First accreditation period ended in January 2006 and was not renewed. 
* TCM Privatuniversität Li Shi Zhen in [[Vienna]]: Accreditation period ended 2009; TCM did not call for renewal. All students could finish their studies.  . 

=== Bulgaria ===. 
[[Bulgaria]] has a number of private universities among which most renown are [[New Bulgarian University]], located in capital sity [[Sofia]], and Burgas Free University, Varna Free University and [[American University in Bulgaria]].  . 

===Germany===. 
[[Germany]] has 83 private universities (called ''Privathochschule'') and 45 church-run universities (called ''kirchliche Hochschule''). Similar to the state-run universities, they are subdivided into ''Universitäten'', ''[[Fachhochschule]]n'' (universities of applied science) and ''Kunst- und Musikhochschulen'' ([[art schools]]). Private universities in Germany need institutional accreditation by the state.  . 

The first private university in Germany, The Ukrainian Free University was established  16 September 1950 in Munich. More recently [[Witten/Herdecke University]] opened in 1982. Though private universities are numerous in Germany, they represent only less than 1% of all students. Some private universities, including [[Hanseatic University Rostock]] (2007–2009) and the International University in Germany in [[Bruchsal]] have gone out of business.  . 

Most of the church universities are run by the Protestant or Catholic churches, however there is one Jewish university (''Hochschule für Jüdische Studien'') in [[Heidelberg]].  . 

=== Greece ===. 
In [[Greece]] private universities are prohibited by [[Constitution of Greece|the constitution]] (Article 16).  However, [[Laboratory of Liberal Studies|laboratories of liberal studies]] (Εργαστήρια ελευθέρων σπουδών, ergastiria eleftheron spoudon) operate freely in the country and based on a law from the 1930s they are registered as private for-profit businesses and regulated by the [[Greek Ministry of Commerce]].  Their academic degrees, which are not recognised in Greece, are directly provided to successful students by foreign universities in the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States of America]], or other countries, usually through [[Franchising|franchise]] or [[validation (education)|validation]] agreements (the franchise agreement usually being considered better).  This has limited access to the laboratories, which usually teach in English, to high-income Greeks who for various reasons (usually family matters) did not want to go abroad.  . 

In 2008 the [[Nea Demokratia]]-led [[government of Greece]] voted a law that will force all laboratories of liberal studies to register with the [[Greek Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs]] as ''[[college]]s'' (κολλέγια, kollegia) by August 2009.  It is expected that this will help to widen the participation of Greek students in private ''colleges'', thus allowing the expertise and efficiency of the private educational sector to benefit the Greek students and society.  .

=== Ireland ===. 
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a private university (more commonly known as a ''private college'') is one that is not funded by the state, and therefore not covered by the  free-fees initiative. All [[List of universities in the Republic of Ireland|universities]], [[Regional Technical College|Institutes of Technology]], [[College of Education|Colleges of Education]], as well as the [[National College of Ireland]] and some religious institutions are publicly funded and therefore covered by ''free-fees'' initiative. There are few private colleges, and they are highly specialised, such as [[Griffith College Dublin]], [[Dorset College]] and [[Dublin Business School]]. The major representative body for private colleges in Ireland is the Higher Education Colleges Association. Private colleges in Ireland can seek to have their programmes validated/accredited by the [[Higher Education and Training Awards Council]].  . 

See external links for: ''free-fees initiative''  and  ''Higher Education Colleges Association'' . 

=== Netherlands ===. 
[[Nyenrode]] is the only private university in the [[Netherlands]] at the graduate level. The university was founded in 1946. It serves as a [[graduate school]] for business and management. Both programs are taught in English.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Recently, Nyenrode merged with the [[Institute for CPA Education]] and both institutions share their facilities. The Nyenrode Business University also contains a campus and active student body.  . 

Other Dutch private universities are universities of applied science (HBOs) where one can obtain a bachelor's. These include [[Business School Notenboom]] (founded in 1958)<ref>http://www.notenboom.nl/</ref> and [[IVA Driebergen]] for the automotive industry with its earliest beginnings in 1930. <ref>http://www.iva-driebergen.nl/index.php?pageID=30&n=47&s=73</ref> . 

=== Portugal ===. 
{{Main|Higher education in Portugal}}
The oldest non-state-run university, the ''[[Universidade Católica Portuguesa]]'' - UCP (Catholic University of Portugal), a [[catholic]] private university ([[concordat]]ory status) with branches in the cities of [[Lisbon]], [[Porto]], [[Braga]], [[Viseu]], and [[Caldas da Rainha]], was founded before the others, in 1967, and officially recognized in 1971. UCP offers some well-recognized degrees and is reputed for economics, law and business management degrees it awards at its Lisbon branch. Other degrees awarded by UCP, like biotechnology and dental medicine, amassed increasing success and popularity since the 2000s. After the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 1974, in the 1980s and 1990s, a boom of educational private institutions was experienced in Portugal and many private universities started to open. Most private universities had a poor reputation and were known for making it easy for students to enter and also to get high grades. In 2007, several of those private universities or their heirs, were investigated and faced compulsory closing (for example, the infamous [[Independente University]] and [[Internacional University]] closings, and the [[Moderna University]] scandal) or official criticism with recommendations that the state-managed investigation proposed for improving their quality and avoid termination. In the mid-2000s, within the [[Bologna process]], a reorganization of higher education was started which included more stringent regulations for private education and expanded state policies with regard to private education quality assurance and [[educational accreditation]]. In general, the private higher education institutions were often considered the schools of last resort for underachieving applicants who didn't score enough points in the admission examinations to enter the main public institutions. Nearly open-admission policies have hurt private universities' reputation and the actual quality of their alumni. Without large endowments like those received, for example, by many US private universities and colleges which are attractive to the best scholars, researchers and students, the private [[list of higher education institutions in Portugal|higher education institutions of Portugal]], with a few exceptions, do not have neither the financial support nor the academic profile to reach the highest teaching and research standards of the top Portuguese [[public universities]]. In addition, most private universities have faced a restrictive lack of collaboration with the major enterprises which, however, have developed fruitful relationships with many public higher education institutions. Most Portuguese private universities specialise in a limited number of fields, most often in the [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]].  . 

=== Switzerland ===. 
Further to the public [[Universities in Switzerland]], the country is well known for its high-quality private education system. It starts with Swiss [[boarding schools]] which have achieved fame. World-class universities such as the [[International Institute for Management Development|IMD]] belong to the category of institutions with top rankings. <ref>http://www.enotes.com/topic/Private_university</ref> [[Leman University Geneva]], founded in Geneva Switzerland, is the only Private University in Switzerland offering programs in Law (Bachelor, Masters and Ph.D.).

The [[University of Buckingham]] is currently the only fully-fledged private university in the United Kingdom. <ref name=independent160211>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/the-university-debate-what-the-ivy-league-can-teach-britain-2215930.html|title=The University Debate: What the Ivy League can teach Britain|accessdate=3 March 2011|publisher=The Independent|date=16 February 2011}}</ref> In July 2010 it was announced that London-based BPP would be granted permission to become a university college. <ref name=the260710>{{cite news|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=412737|title=BPP wins university college status as David Willetts acts on pledge to boost private providers|accessdate=3 March 2011|publisher=The Independent|date=26 July 2010}}</ref> [[BPP University College of Professional Studies|BPP University College]] is now the UK's only private university college. <ref name=the260710/> . 

Other private degree awarding bodies in the UK include: [[Ashridge Business School]], [[ifs School of Finance]], [[The College of Law]] and [[Regent's College]], all of which are privately funded charitable bodies. In addition the private [[Richmond, The American International University in London|Richmond University]] has its degrees are validated by the public [[Open University]].  . 

All other British universities are public.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}<ref name=bbc151110>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11762430|title='Fees keep universities public', Vince Cable says|accessdate=3 March 2011|publisher=BBC News|date=15 November 2010}}</ref> They have considerable institutional autonomy, but are currently funded mainly by government teaching and research grants{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} and the government regulates their tuition fees, student funding and student loans and commissions and regulates research assessments and teaching reviews. However, unlike in Continental European countries, the British government does not own universities' assets, and university staff are not civil servants. Government regulation arises as a condition of accepting funding from bodies such as [[Higher Education Funding Council for England|HEFCE]] and any university can in principle choose to leave the HEFCE regulated system at any time. <ref name='OXCHEPS39'>{{cite web | url = http://oxcheps.new.ox.ac.uk/MainSite%20pages/Resources/OxCHEPS_OP39.pdf | title = OFFA and £6000-9000 tuition fees | accessdate = 2011-03-20 | last = Dennis | first = Farrington | coauthors = David Palfreyman | date = 2011-02-21 | format = PDF | work = OxCHEPS Occasional Paper No. 39 | publisher = Oxford Centre for Higher Education Policy Studies | quote = Note, however, that any university which does not want funding from HEFCE can, as a private corporation, charge whatever tuition fees it likes (exactly as does, say, the University of Buckingham or BPP University College). Under existing legislation and outside of the influence of the HEFCE-funding mechanism upon universities, Government can no more control university tuition fees than it can dictate the price of socks in Marks & Spencer. Universities are not part of the State and they are not part of the public sector; Government has no reserve powers of intervention even in a failing institution. }}</ref> . 

From September 2012 government funding for teaching and background funding for research will be substantially reduced, with one study indicating that annual Government funding for teaching and research will make up just 15% of universities’ income by 2015. <ref name='PatonJan2012'>{{cite news | first = Graeme | last = Paton | title = Taxpayer funding of universities 'to drop to 100 year low' | date = 2012-01-05 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/8992136/Taxpayer-funding-of-universities-to-drop-to-100-year-low.html | work = The Telegraph | accessdate = 2012-01-06}}</ref> . 

In the UK, an institution can only use the title "University" or "University College" if it has been granted by the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]], under the terms of the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]]. <ref name="privy">{{cite web |url=http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/Page27.asp |title=Higher Education |accessdate=2007-12-06 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Privy Council Office (United Kingdom)|Privy Council Office]]}}</ref>  Prior to 1992, these titles were conferred by [[Royal_charter#United_Kingdom|Royal Charter]].  .

=== Guatemala === . 

In Guatemala, the only Public university is [[Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala]]. The rest of the degree offering institutions in the country are Private. See the [[List of universities in Guatemala]] for a list of the Private Universities in the country.  . 

=== United States ===. 
In the U.S., many universities and colleges are private, operated as educational and research [[nonprofit organization]]s. Some of the most prestigious universities in the U.S. are actually private universities. Examples include [[Harvard University]], [[Stanford University]], [[Yale University]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and [[Rice University]].  . 

While most [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]] are likewise private, there are also some [[Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges|public liberal arts colleges]]. Some private universities are closely affiliated with religious organizations (for example, the [[University of Notre Dame]]) and some are directly operated by religious organizations (such as [[Brigham Young University]]).  . 

An emerging practice in the sector of private colleges and universities is for investors to procure struggling private [[non-profit]] colleges or universities in order to salvage or expand the institution. When investors are involved with the institution, it consequently changes the status of the institution from non-profit to for-profit; such as in the case of [[United States University]].  . 

[[Proprietary colleges]] are also private though they are most often referred to as proprietary colleges to prevent confusion with [[non-profit]] private institutions.  . 

Like government-operated institutions, private universities are eligible for [[educational accreditation]], but some private universities (primarily proprietary colleges) lack accreditation (see [[list of unaccredited institutions of higher learning]]), and their degrees are not formally recognized.  . 

Legally, private universities may not discriminate, but generally have a somewhat free hand in setting admissions policies. For example, universities in the [[Ivy League]] based their selections on many secondary factors other than academic performance, up through the beginning of the 20th century. <ref name="gladwell">Gladwell, Malcolm. (2005) "Getting In: the social logic of Ivy League admissions." The New Yorker, October 10, 2005 [http://www.newyorker.com/critics/atlarge/articles/051010crat_atlarge]</ref> Since the post WW2-era, however, following in the mold of [[James Bryant Conant]] at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], most private universities have made enormous strides in becoming [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]]. The nation's private institutions now make broad efforts to recruit students from underprivileged backgrounds.  . 

The U.S. system of education has also been transplanted to other countries. Private universities such as the [[American University in Cairo]] and the [[American University of Afghanistan]] typically offer a liberal arts curriculum to their students.  . 

[[Tuition fees]] at private universities tend to be higher than at [[public universities]] though many private universities offer financial aid as well. <ref>Tottie, Gunnel. (2001) ''Introduction to American English'' Blackwell Publishing. p. 65. ISBN 0-631-19792-3. </ref> . 

==Oceania==. 
=== Australia ===. 
[[Bond University]], [[Australia]]'s first private university, dates from 1987. <ref name="Serials Management">{{cite book | title=Serials Management in Australia and New Zealand | author=Burrows, Toby | year=1993 | publisher=Haworth Press | location=Binghamton, NY | pages=19 | isbn=1560244534}}</ref> It runs three semesters per year (correlating exactly with the Northern and Southern Hemispheres' schedules), which allows a student to complete a six semester degree in two years and an eight semester degree (e.g. Law) in under three years. <ref name="Guide to Studying Abroad">{{cite book | title=Guide to Studying Abroad | author=Princeton Review | authorlink=Princeton Review | year=2004 | publisher=The Princeton Review | location=New York, NY | pages=105 | isbn=9780375763717}}</ref> . 

Since Bond University's foundation, the [[University of Notre Dame Australia]] opened as a private university, in 1989. {{As of | 2010}} the two remain Australia's only private universities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} . 

[[Melbourne University]], a public university, owned a private university called [[Melbourne University Private]] from 1998 to 2005. The private university was not successful, losing [[Australian dollar|A$]]20,000,000 over its lifetime.  . 

On 8 December 2011, the state government of Victoria announced it had approved the Melbourne College of Divinity to be the country's first "specialised university".{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} The institution was renamed "MCD University of Divinity".{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}. The university is a federation of eight Christian recognised teaching institutes focusing on theological education and preparation for work as clergy: Australian Lutheran College (ALC), Stirling Theological College, Catholic Theological College (CTC), The Institute for Christian Spirituality and Pastoral Formation (ICSPF), The Salvation Army (Australian Southern) Booth College (SATC), United Faculty of Theology (UFT), Whitley College and Yarra Theological Union (YTU).{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} .
