'''New College of the Humanities''' ('''NCH''') is a proposed new private for-profit [[undergraduate]] college in London, England, the creation of which was announced in June 2011 by the philosopher [[A.C. Grayling]], its founder and first master. <ref name=BoothJune82011/> It is offering tuition from October 2012<ref name=BBCJune52011 /> in economics, English, history, law and philosophy for undergraduate degrees with the [[University of London International Programmes]] and in addition, it will require all students to work toward a "Diploma of New College" by completing courses in critical thinking, practical ethics, science literacy, and professional skills. <ref name=RaiJune62011>Rai, Binda.

NCH will charge domestic and overseas students annual fees of £18,000, twice the maximum fee publicly funded universities in England may charge domestic students from 2012, with its charitable trust aiming to provide 50 assisted places in the first year, out of 200 overall. <ref name=LipscombJune92011/> In addition to Grayling, 13 senior academics have been named as partners, including the biologist [[Richard Dawkins]]. <ref name=MalikJune92011>Malik, Shiv.

The announcement attracted a substantial response in the UK, and a significant amount of adverse publicity, where most higher education institutions are publicly funded. London's mayor, [[Boris Johnson]], welcomed it as a bold experiment, while ''The Times'' argued that higher education has been a closed shop in the UK for too long. <ref>Johnson, Boris.

*"Experiments in Teaching," ''The Times'', June 8, 2011. </ref> There was an angry reaction from sections of the academic community. Complaints included that NCH had copied the course descriptions of the University of London's international programmes on its website; was offering the same syllabus with a significantly higher price tag; and that the senior academics involved with the project would in fact do very little of the teaching. <ref name=BakerJune92011/> . 

In January 2012, the [[United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office|UK's Intellectual Property Office]] objected to the proposed college name apparently over possible confusion with [[New College, Oxford]]. <ref name ="BBC 2012 01 23">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-16681870 ''Private college faces objection in trade mark bid'' BBC News 23 January 2012 accessed 23 January 2012]</ref> . 

==Background==. 
===Origins===. 
[[File:AC Grayling 2.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[A.C. Grayling]], professor of philosophy at Birkbeck College until June 2011, secured NCH's funding.]]
The college has said it will model itself on [[liberal arts college]]s in the United States, such as [[Amherst College]]. <ref name=GrimstonJune52011>Grimston, Jack. "Top dons create new Oxbridge," ''The Sunday Times'', June 5, 2011. </ref> Initial reports said it aimed to offer an education to rival that of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]],<ref name=TelegraphJune52011>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/8557555/New-university-to-rival-Oxbridge-will-charge-18000-a-year.html "New university to rival Oxbridge will charge £18,000 a year"], ''The Sunday Telegraph'', June 5, 2011. </ref> but Grayling said this had been blown out of proportion by press hyperbole. <ref name=MalikJune92011/> He said he had the idea for the college years ago when he was admissions tutor for an [[Oxbridge]] college, and was turning down 12 good applicants for every successful one. <ref name=JohnsonJune62011>Johnson, Boris.

Grayling said [[David Willetts]], the universities minister, was told of the project in 2010, and appeared enthusiastic. <ref name=GrimstonJune122011/> NCH was first named Grayling Hall, incorporated in July 2010 and registered at an address in [[Peckham]], south London. The name was changed to New College of the Humanities in February 2011. <ref>For registration and change of name, see [http://www.jordans.co.uk/CompanyIndex/n/ne/new/07317195/new_college_of_the_humanities_limited.html "New College of the Humanities Limited"], Jordan's Business Information Services, accessed June 8, 2011.

===Funding and governance===. 
Initial "seed capital" of £200,000 for the project was provided, according to ''The Guardian'', by the financier Peter Hall. <ref>Hughes, Solomon., Evans, Robert and Shepherd, Jessica.

Ten million pounds in [[private equity firm|private equity funding]] was subsequently raised to cover costs for two years, with the expectation that NCH would break even by the third. <ref name="VasagarJune62011"/> One third of the enterprise is owned by 14 senior academics, including Grayling, and the rest by private investors, including a couple from Switzerland and three British businessmen—Jeremy Gibbs, Matthew Batstone and [[Roy W.

The college has as yet no facilities of its own. It plans for its students to register for University of London degrees as external students under the University of London International Programmes, and as such, their students should, upon payment of the appropriate fees, have access to the university's facilities, including the [[Senate House (University of London)|Senate House Library]] and [[University of London Union]]. <ref name=KyddJune82011>Kydd, Jonathan.

NCH plans to offer classes from October 2012,<ref name=BBCJune52011 /> with annual fees of £18,000, twice the maximum fee public universities in England may charge domestic students from 2012, and similar to those for private universities in the United States. <ref name=THSJune62011>[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=416405&c=1 "Top names, top whack: new humanities-focused institution to charge £18K fees"], ''Times Higher Education'', June 6, 2011.

The grants will consist of 100 percent means-tested scholarships, and [[Exhibition (scholarship)|exhibitions]] where the student will pay £7,200 a year. The aim for future years is to have more than 30 percent of its students receiving grants. <ref name=LipscombJune92011/> The college plans eventually to recruit 375 students each year, with no more than one third from outside the UK.

===Courses===. 
The college will offer tuition for five degree subjects: an LLB in Law, BSc in Economics, and BAs in English, History or Philosophy. In addition, students will study three core subjects—logic and critical thinking, science literacy, and applied ethics—and complete a professional skills course. <ref name=courses>[http://www.nchum.org/courses "Courses"] and [http://www.nchum.org/quality "Quality"], New College of the Humanities, accessed June 5, 2011. </ref> The science literacy course will include as its teachers, Richard Dawkins (Professor of Evolutionary Biology NCH), Steve Jones (Professor of Biological Sciences NCH) lecturing on genetics, biodiversity and climate change and Lawrence Krauss (Professor of Science NCH) teaching cosmology and particle physics. <ref name=whoweare/> Graduates will receive a University of London degree for completing the degree course, and a Diploma of New College for completing the four compulsory courses. <ref name=Graylingvideo>Grayling, A.C. [http://vimeo.com/24953102 "Video introduction"], New College of the Humanities, accessed June 5, 2011. </ref> They will then be awarded, for example, a BA Hons (London) DNC. <ref name=BBCJune52011>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13659394 "British academics launch £18,000 college in London"], BBC News, June 5, 2011. </ref>  . 

''The Guardian'' writes that the same degree courses are available from [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck]], [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths]], and [[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway]] colleges for £9,000 or less. Academics complained that the syllabuses had been copied from the University of London's website, and had simply been repackaged. <ref name=BoothJune62011/> [[Amanda Vickery]], an historian at [[Queen Mary, University of London]], posted on [[Twitter]]: "Perplexed to see my own course 'Experience, Culture & Identity: Women's lives in England 1688-1850' available from NCH". <ref  name=GuttenplanJune132011>Guttenplan, D.D.

The University of London said it had no formal agreement with NCH concerning academic matters, and that NCH had not yet applied for recognition as an "Independent Teaching Institution" associated with the university's external programme, which would normally require a track record. <ref name=RaiJune62011/> It said it was legitimate for NCH to provide tuition to students pursuing its international programmes, as other colleges do in the UK and elsewhere, for a fee in most cases of under £1,500 per annum. <ref name=BoothJune62011>Booth, Richard.

He said: "What's important about a degree is how it is taught and who it is taught by."<ref name=BakerJune92011/> . 

===Teaching===. 
NCH says it will offer a 10:1 student-teacher ratio. <ref name=TelegraphJune52011/> Subject-area convenors—including historian [[Suzannah Lipscomb]] of the University of East Anglia, and philosophers [[Ken Gemes]] from Birkbeck and Naomi Goulder from Bristol University—will recruit and lead the teaching staff. Lipscomb wrote that the college plans to offer students 12–13 contact hours a week, including two tutorials, one of them one-to-one. <ref name=LipscombJune92011>Lipscomb, Suzannah.

The 14 academics named as partners will do some teaching, though most hold full-time jobs elsewhere, several in the United States. The NCH website refers to them as its professoriate, which led to criticism that it will be a largely absent one. <ref name=GreenJune72011>Green, David Allen.

"Minister encouraged launch of elite college," ''The Sunday Times'', June 12, 2011. </ref> Zuckerman will teach up to 20 hours; he said the pay was comparable to fees for visiting professors in the United States.

"AC Grayling: Is it safe to come out now?", ''The Sunday Times'', June 12, 2011. </ref> and London's mayor, [[Boris Johnson]], called it the boldest experiment in higher education in the UK since the foundation in 1983 of the [[University of Buckingham]], the UK's first private university; he wrote that it showed the way ahead for academics demoralized by government interference with admissions procedures and "scapegoated for the weaknesses of the schools."<ref name=JohnsonJune62011/> ''The Times'' argued that higher education has been a closed shop in the UK for too long, that all over the world there are excellent universities run independently of the state, and that in its conception NCH is teaching by example. <ref>"Experiments in Teaching," ''The Times'', June 8, 2011. </ref> ''The Economist'' wrote that there is a market for the idea because of the increasing number of qualified British students who fail to get into their university of choice, in part because of pressure on the top universities from the [[Office for Fair Access]] to increase the number of students from state schools; they added that "a 'toffs’ college' of well-heeled Oxbridge near-misses is a provocative concept."<ref name=EconomistJune92011>[http://www.economist.com/node/18805758 "One very New College, at a price"], ''The Economist'', June 9, 2011. </ref> The Harvard historian Niall Ferguson, one of the college's partners, said he had read the criticism of NCH with incredulity: "Anyone who cares about the humanities will be cheering Anthony Grayling."<ref name=GrimstonJune122011/> .

[[Toby Young]] argued in ''The Daily Telegraph'' that the reaction was part of a left-wing campaign to retain state control over education, involving, he wrote, public sector unions, university lecturers, and the Socialist Workers Party. <ref>[http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tobyyoung/100091198/welcome-to-the-fight-professor-grayling/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter "Welcome to the fight, Professor Grayling"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', June 8, 2011. </ref> [[Simon Jenkins]] wrote that the country's professors, lecturers and student trade unionists were "united in arms against what they most hate and fear: academic celebrity, student fees, profit and loss, one-to-one tutorials and America."<ref>Jenkins, Simon.

Grayling responded to the criticism by arguing that NCH is trying to keep humanities teaching alive. He said he felt persecuted by the negative reaction: "My whole record, everything I have written, is turned on its head. Now I am a bastard capitalist. It is really upsetting. ... Education is a public good and we should be spending more on it and it shouldn't be necessary to do this, but standing on the sidelines moaning and wailing is not an option."<ref  name=VasagarBoothJune72011/> A dozen protesters heckled him at Foyles book shop in London on June 7 during a debate about cuts to arts funding, one of them shouting that Grayling had "no right to speak." A protester let off a smoke bomb, and 100 people were evacuated from the store. <ref>Hough, Andrew.
