The '''University of Phoenix''' ('''UPX''','''UoP''' '''UOPX''') is a [[For-profit school|for-profit]] institution of higher learning. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Apollo Group]] Inc. which is a publicly traded ({{nasdaq|APOL}}) S&P 500 corporation based in Phoenix, Arizona. The university has more than 200 campuses worldwide and confers degrees in over 100 degree programs at the [[Associate's degree|associate]], [[bachelor's]], [[master's]] and [[doctorate|doctoral]] levels. <ref name="largest">[http://www.azbiz.com/articles/2008/08/08/news/doc489c8e8b1ec58870093097.txt University of Phoenix provides growth opportunities for working adults] Lee Allen.

The University of Phoenix is one of the largest higher education providers in North America. Although the university attained a peak enrollment of almost 600,000 students in 2010, a 30% enrollment drop in 2011 has been attributed to operational changes amid criticism of high debt loads and low job prospects for UOPX students. <ref name="WSJ2011">{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20111019-706464.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Apollo Group 4Q Net Soars On Fewer Charges; Enrollment Falls | date=2011-10-19}}</ref> These changes include allowing students to try classes before officially enrolling and recruiter training programs that are designed to improve student retention and completion rates. <ref name="Bloomberg2011">{{cite news| url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-19/apollo-fourth-quarter-profit-sales-top-analysts-estimates-1-.html | work=Bloomberg | first=John | last=Lauerman | title=Apollo Fourth-Quarter Profit, Sales Top Analysts' Estimates | date=2011-10-19}}</ref> .

The university says that the electronic textbooks include search features and hyperlinks to glossary terms that make the books easier to use for research. <ref name="deseret">{{cite news | author=Leonard, Wendy | title=E-Books Make Learning Cheaper | work=[[Deseret News]] | date=August 25, 2008 | url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,700253600,00.html | accessdate=2009-06-30}}</ref> . 

===eCampus===. 
Through its online portal, eCampus, University of Phoenix students also have access to software required for coursework.

==Academics==.

In addition to its traditional education programs, the school offers [[continuing education]] courses for teachers and practitioners, [[professional development]] courses for companies, and specialized courses of study for military personnel. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phoenix.edu/online_and_campus_programs/online_and_campus_programs.aspx |title=UoP Online and Campus Programs |accessdate=2008-05-04 |work= }}</ref> . 

Students spend 20 to 24 hours with an instructor during each course, compared with about 40 hours at a traditional university. The university also requires students to collaborate by working on learning team projects, wherein the class will be divided into learning teams of four to five students. Each learning team is assigned a team forum where team members will discuss the project and submit their agreed upon portions of the learning team assignment for compilation by the nominated learning team leader. The concept of learning teams is somewhat uncommon in traditional academia; however, the University of Phoenix believes that collaborating on projects and having individuals rely on each other reflects the real working conditions of the corporate world. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenix.edu/students/how-it-works/student_experience/learning-teams.html |title=Learning Teams - University of Phoenix |publisher=Phoenix.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-03}}</ref> .

It’s a very low level of instruction."<ref name=Dillon021107/> In May 2008, the university announced the formation of the University of Phoenix National Research Center, designed to study which teaching methods work best for nontraditional students. <ref>[http://chronicle.com/news/article/4436/u-of-phoenix-draws-big-names-to-advisory-panel-on-new-center-on-teaching-adults U. of Phoenix Draws Big Names to Advisory Panel on New Center on Teaching Adults] Chronicle of Higher Education 2008-05-27</ref> The research center no longer exists.  .

When calculated using the standards set by the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]], UOPX's overall graduation rate is 16%, which, when compared to the national average of 55%, is among the nation's lowest. The federal standard measures graduation rates as the percentage of first-time undergraduates who obtain a degree within six years. The number is significantly lower at iUOPX's Southern California campus (6%) and its online programs (4%). This measurement does not take into consideration the typical University of Phoenix student who comes to the University as a dropout from another institution, so is not a first-time college student. <ref name=Dillon021107>Sam Dillon, [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/11/education/11phoenix.html Troubles Grow for a University Built on Profits], ''The New York Times'', February 11, 2007. </ref>  The University of Phoenix acknowledges the 16% graduation rate but takes exception to the standard used by the Department of Education to calculate the rate, saying that the rate is based upon criteria that apply to only 7% of UOPX's student population. <ref name="reason">{{cite web|author=Katherine Mangu-Ward from the July 2008 issue |url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/126856.html |title="Education for Profit-Why is everyone flaming the University of Phoenix?"

===Faculty===. 
The university's faculty consists of approximately 1,500 core faculty and 20,000 associate (part-time or adjunct) faculty members who all hold graduate degrees. <ref name="faculty">[http://upxnewsroom.com/facts/faculty.aspx ''University of Phoenix Faculty Overview'']. Retrieved February 17, 2008. </ref> UOPX's reliance on part-time faculty—95 percent of Phoenix instructors teach part time, compared to an average of 47 percent nationwide—has been criticized by regulators and academic critics. Most of the classes are centrally crafted and standardized across teachers in order to ensure consistency and reduce costs for the school. Additionally, faculty members do not get tenure. <ref name=Yung022804/><ref name=Dillon021107>Sam Dillon, [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/11/education/11phoenix.html?ex=1328850000&en=5c8573d57de4bffe&ei=5088 Troubles Grow for a University Built on Profits], ''The New York Times'', February 11, 2007. </ref><ref name=reason/> According to a University of Phoenix officer, pre-screened instructional candidates participate in a training program in the discipline in which they teach, which he states has the effect of weeding out 40%–50% of the less committed or capable applicants. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ers0303/cs/ecs0304.pdf |title=Supporting E-Learning at the University of Phoenix |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-03}}</ref> .
