'''Further education''' (often abbreviated '''FE'''; called [[continuing education]] in U.S. English) is a term mainly used in connection with education in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It is post-compulsory [[education]] (in addition to that received at [[secondary school]]), that is distinct from the education offered in [[universities]] ([[higher education]]). It may be at any level above compulsory education, from basic training to [[Higher National Diploma]] or [[Foundation Degree]].  . 

A distinction is usually made between FE and [[higher education]] ("HE") which is education at a higher level than secondary school, usually provided in distinct institutions such as [[universities]]. FE in the United Kingdom therefore includes education for people over 16, usually excluding universities.  It is primarily taught in FE [[college]]s (which are similar in concept to [[United States]] [[community college]]s, and sometimes use "community college" in their title), work-based learning, and adult and community learning institutions. This includes post-16 courses similar to those taught at schools and sub-degree courses similar to those taught at [[higher education]] (HE) colleges (which also teach degree-level courses) and at some universities.  .

===Australia===. 
{{Main|Technical and further education}} . 

In [[Australia]], '''technical and further education''' or '''TAFE''' (pronounced {{IPA-en|ˈteɪf|}}) institutions provide a wide range of predominantly vocational [[post-secondary education|tertiary education]] courses, mostly qualifying courses under the [[National Training System (Australia)|National Training System]]/[[Australian Qualifications Framework]]/Australian Quality Training Framework. Fields covered include hospitality, tourism, construction, engineering, secretarial skills, visual arts, information technology and community work.  . 

Individual TAFE institutions (usually with many campuses) are known as either colleges or institutes, depending on the state or territory. TAFE colleges are owned, operated and financed by the various [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]] governments. This is in contrast to the [[higher education]] sector, whose funding is predominantly the domain of the [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth government]] and whose [[university|universities]] are predominantly owned by the state governments.  .

==== England ====. 
{{See also|List of further education colleges in England}}
From 2001-2010 FE in England was managed by the [[Learning and Skills Council]] (LSC), the then largest government agency funding education provision. The LSC had a budget of some £13 billion and is organised on a regional basis through around 47 local councils. The LSC had a particular mission to improve and expand further education provision, driven by the UK government's desire to increase standards in post-16 student retention and achievement, particularly in skills-based vocational provision in FE colleges. Recent government-driven LSC and [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] policies, such as [[Success for All]] and the Skills Strategy, articulate this vision.  . 

Colleges in England that are regarded as part of the FE sector include:
*General FE (GFE) and tertiary colleges
*[[Sixth form colleges]]
*Specialist colleges (mainly colleges of agriculture and horticulture and colleges of drama and dance)
*Adult education institutes . 

In addition, FE courses may be offered in the school sector, both in sixth form (16-19) schools, or, more commonly, sixth forms within secondary schools.  . 

The [[Learning and Skills Improvement Service]] (LSIS - formerly the [[Quality Improvement Agency]] and Centre for Excellence in Leadership) is the sector owned body supporting the development of excellent and sustainable FE provision across the learning and skills sector.  Its aim is to accelerate the drive for excellence and, working in partnership with all parts of the sector, builds on the sector’s own capacity to design, commission and deliver improvement and strategic change.  . 

The [[Learning and Skills Network LSN]] offers training and consultancy.  . 

For technology support and advice, [[JISC]] provides a network of regional support centres, free at the point of use to anyone working in colleges in the UK.  . 

From September 2007, teachers working in FE in England are required to gain professional status, known as [[Qualified Teacher Learning and Skills]] (QTLS). The first stage of QTLS is an initial 'passport to teaching' module. The second stage is full teacher training, which would typically take up to five years to complete. The qualification covers both taught and practical skills, and also requires teachers to undertake 30 hours of continuous professional development per year.  . 

Good quality support for employers is indicated by the award of the Training Quality Standard,  an initiative to improve the quality of provision for vocational education, while all colleges and FE providers are subject to regular inspections by [[Ofsted]].  . 

[[Lifelong Learning UK]] is the independent sector skills council responsible for the qualifications and standards for teachers working in FE. The trade unions for FE staff are the [[University and College Union]] and the [[Association of Teachers and Lecturers]]. Teachers working in the sixth form colleges, sixth form schools and sixth forms of secondary schools are eligible to join the  teaching unions which recruit in the secondary school sector . 

In England, further education is often seen as forming one part of a wider [[learning and skills]] sector, alongside workplace education, prison education, and other types of non-school, non-university education and training. Since June 2009, the sector is overseen by the new [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]], although some parts (such as education and training for 14-19 year olds) fall within the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]].  . 

==== Northern Ireland ====. 
Further education in Northern Ireland is provided through six multi-campus colleges [http://www.delni.gov.uk/index/further-and-higher-education/further-education/further-education-colleges-and-courses.htm].

*[[Belfast Metropolitan College]]
*[[North West Regional College]]
*[[Northern Regional College]]
*[[South Eastern Regional College]]
*[[South West College]]

Most secondary schools also provide a Sixth Form scheme whereby a student can choose to attend said school for 2 additional years to complete their AS and A-levels.  . 

==== Scotland ====. 
{{Main|List of further education colleges in Scotland}} . 

Scotland's further education colleges provide education for those young people who follow a vocational route after the end of compulsory education at age 16. They offer a wide range of vocational qualifications to young people and older adults, including [[NVQ|SVQ]]s, [[Higher National Certificates]] and [[Higher National Diplomas]]. Frequently, the first two years of [[higher education]], usually in the form of an [[HND]] can be taken in an FE college, followed by attendance at university.  . 

==== Wales ====.
