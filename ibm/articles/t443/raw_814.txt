A '''classroom''' is a [[room]] in which [[teaching]] or [[learning]] activities can take place.  Classrooms are found in educational institutions of all kinds, including public and private schools, home schools, corporations, and religious and humanitarian organizations.  The classroom attempts to provide a safe space where learning can take place uninterrupted by other distractions.  . 

==Typical equipment== .

Most classrooms have a large writing surface where the instructor or students can share notes with other members of the class. Traditionally, this was in the form of a [[chalkboard|blackboard]] but these are becoming less common in well-equipped schools, and are replaced by flipcharts, [[whiteboard]]s and [[interactive whiteboard]]s. Many classrooms also have [[TV]]s, [[map]]s, [[chart]]s, [[Pencils]], [[book]]s, [[monograph]]s and [[LCD projectors]] for presenting information and images from a computer.  .

The layout, design and decor of the classroom has a significant effect upon the quality of education.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  Attention to the acoustics and colour scheme may reduce distractions and aid concentration.  The lighting and furniture likewise influence study and learning.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} .

For lessons that require specific resources or a [[vocational education|vocational]] approach different types of classrooms both indoors and outdoors are used. This is known as [[situated learning]]. Classrooms can range from small groups of five or six to big classrooms with hundreds of students. A large class room is also called a [[lecture hall]]. A few examples of classrooms are [[computer lab]]s which are used for [[Information technology|IT]] lessons in schools, [[gym]]nasiums for sports, and science [[laboratories]] for [[biology]], [[chemistry]] and [[physics]].  . 

==Challenges to the classroom==.

While the classroom is clearly the dominant setting for learning, the flexibility of classroom instruction is often called into question.{{By whom|date=May 2010}}  Instead of isolating learners in a classroom, many teachers{{Who|date=May 2010}} are experimenting with integrating learning into a student's daily life.  New learning technologies and mobile devices {{Specify|date=May 2010}} make it possible for learning to take place at any time, at any place, and (perhaps most importantly) at any pace that the learner desires.  . 

According to the American Society for Training and Development, more than 40% of corporate training now takes place [[online]] and not in a classroom.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} .
