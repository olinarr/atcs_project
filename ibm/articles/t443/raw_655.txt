'''Dropping out''' means leaving a group for either practical reasons, necessities or disillusionment with the system from which the individual in question leaves.  . 

Most commonly, dropping out refers to a [[student]] quitting school before he or she graduates. It cannot always be ascertained that a student has dropped out, as he or she may stop attending without terminating enrollment. It is estimated 1.2 million students annually dropout of high school in the United States, where high school graduation rates rank 19th in the world. <ref>[http://www.dosomething.org/tipsandtools/11-facts-about-dropping-out High School Dropouts]</ref> Reasons are varied and may include: to find work, avoid [[bullying]], family emergency, poor grades, depression, [[Teenage pregnancy|unexpected pregnancy]], bad environment, lack of freedom, and boredom from lack of lessons relevant to the world of work. ''The Silent Epidemic: Perspectives of High School Dropouts''<ref>[http://www.civicenterprises.net/pdfs/thesilentepidemic3-06.pdf The Silent Epidemic: Perspectives of High School Dropouts]</ref> by Civic Enterprises explores reasons students leave school without graduating. The consequences of dropping out of school can have long-term economic and social repercussions. Students who drop out of school in the United States are more likely to be unemployed, homeless, receiving welfare and incarcerated. <ref>[http://www.nodropouts.org NoDropouts.org]</ref> A four-year study in San Francisco found that 94 percent of young murder victims were high school dropouts. <ref>http://www.nodropouts.org/blog/young-murder-victims-almost-certain-be-dropouts</ref>   . 

In the 1960s, "dropping out" was used to mean withdrawing from established society, especially because of disillusionment with conventional values. It is a term commonly associated with the 1960s [[counterculture]] and with [[hippie]]s and [[commune (intentional community)|commune]]s. See [[Turn on, tune in, drop out]].  . 

In [[clinical trial]]s, participants may withdraw from the study, for example, due to [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]]. This is also referred to as dropping out.  . 

==Dropout recovery==. 
A '''dropout recovery''' initiative is any community, government, non-profit or business program in which students who have previously left school are sought out for the purpose of re-enrollment. In the [[United States]], such initiatives are often focused on former [[high school]] students who are still young enough to have their educations publicly subsidized, generally those 22 years of age and younger.

Dropout recovery programs can be initiated in traditional "brick-and-mortar" institutions of learning, in community centers or online.  .
