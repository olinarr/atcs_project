'''Taking Children Seriously''' ('''TCS''') is a parenting movement and educational philosophy whose central idea is that it is possible and desirable to raise and educate children without either doing anything to them against their will, or making them do anything against their will.  . 

It was founded in 1994 as an email mailing-list by the [[libertarians]] [[Sarah Fitz-Claridge]] and [[David Deutsch]]. Deutsch is also a theoretical [[physicist]] at [[Oxford University]]. <ref>"[http://www.takingchildrenseriously.com/node/136 Origins of TCS.]"</ref> . 

TCS begins with the observation that most traditional interactions between adults and youth are based on [[coercion]]. The TCS model of [[parenting]] and [[education]] rejects this coercion as infringing on the will of the child, and also rejects parental or educator "self-sacrifice" as infringing on the will of the adult. TCS advocates that parents and children work to find a [[:wikt:common preference|common preference]], a solution all parties genuinely prefer to all other candidate solutions they can think of. <ref> "[http://www.takingchildrenseriously.com/common_preferences_and_non_coercion Taking Children Seriously common preferences and non-coercion.]"</ref> . 

The TCS philosophy was inspired by the [[epistemology]] of [[Karl Popper]]. Popper was a professional educator himself before he started to do philosophy. In fact, philosophy was only a second option for him at that time, to be able to emigrate to escape the imminent [[Anschluss]]. He was active in the ''Wiener Schulreform'' (Vienna school reform) movement,<ref>[[Karl R. Popper]] (1925) "Über die Stellung des Lehrers zu Schule und Schüler," ''Schulreform'' '''4'''(4): 204–208. </ref><ref>Popper, K. R. (1927) "Zur Philosophie des Heimatgedankens," ''Die Quelle'' '''77'''(10): 899–908. </ref> and there are connections between the psychology of learning, on which he did his doctoral thesis,<ref>Popper, K R. (1928) ''Zur Methodenfrage der Denkpsychologie''. Wien (unpublished dissertation). </ref> and his philosophy. <ref>[[William W. Bartley]] (1970) "Die österreichische Schulreform als die Wiege der modernen Philosophie" in Gerhard Szcesny, ed., ''Club Voltaire IV''. Hamburg: 360. ISBN 3-499-65086-X. </ref> However, as a philosopher, he did not advocate any concrete pedagogy, although he had some general views on the issue. <ref>Champion, Rafe (1987) "[http://www.the-rathouse.com/RC_PopperEdu.html Popper on Education.]"</ref> TCS views Popper's epistemology, as Popper himself, as a universal theory of how [[knowledge]] grows, and tries to work out its profound implications for [[Philosophy of education|educational theory]].  .
