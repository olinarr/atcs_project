'''Maturity''' is a [[psychology|psychological]] term used to indicate how a person responds to the [[circumstance]]s or [[Social environment|environment]] in an [[Norm (sociology)|appropriate]] manner.  This response is generally learned rather than [[instinct]]ive, and is not determined by one's age.  Maturity also encompasses being aware of the correct time and place to behave and knowing when to act appropriately, according to the situation and the culture of the society one lives in.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} . 

Adult development and maturity theories include the purpose in life concept. Maturity emphasizes a clear comprehension of life's purpose, directedness, and intentionality which, contributes to the feeling that life is meaningful. <ref>{{cite web | last = Adler | first = Nancy | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Purpose in Life | work = Psychosocial workgroup | publisher = MacArthur | date = November 1997 | url = http://www.macses.ucsf.edu/research/psychosocial/purpose.php | accessdate = 2011-11-03}}</ref> .

In fact, [[judge]] [[Julian Mack]], who helped create the [[juvenile court]] system in the [[United States]], said that juvenile justice was based on the belief that young people do not always make good decisions because they are not mature, but this means that they can be reformed more easily than adults. <ref>{{Cite journal
