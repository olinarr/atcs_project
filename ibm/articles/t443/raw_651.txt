'''Education in Israel''' refers to the comprehensive education system of [[Israel]]. Expenditure on education accounts for approximately 10% of GDP, and most schools are subsidized by the state. The education system  consists of three tiers: [[primary education]] (grades 1-6, approx. ages 6–12), [[middle school]] (grades 7-9, approx. ages 12–15) and [[high school]] (grades 10-12, approx. ages 15–18). [[Compulsory education]] is from kindergarten through 12th grade. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/1,7340,L-3426749,00.html |title=ynet חוק חינוך חובה - מעתה עד כיתות י"ב - חדשות היום |publisher=Ynet.co.il |date=1995-06-20 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}</ref> The school year begins on 1 September and ends, in elementary school on 30 June, and in middle school and high school on 20 June. From the school year of 2012, in Israel every school year will start on 26 August.  . 

==Educational tracks==. 
Israeli schools are divided into four tracks: state (''Mamlachti''), state-religious (''Mamlachti dati''), Independent ([[Haredi]]) schools (''[[Chinuch Atzmai]]'') and [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab]]. <ref name="JP-2008-04-18">{{cite news

</ref> There are also [[private school]]s which reflect the philosophies of specific groups of parents (Democratic Schools) or are based on a curriculum of a foreign country (e.g. The American School). The majority of Israeli children attend state schools. State-religious schools, catering to youngsters from the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] sector (mainly [[Religious Zionist]] / [[Modern Orthodox]]), offer intensive Jewish studies programs and emphasize tradition and observance. The Chinuch Atzmai schools focus almost entirely on [[Torah study]] and offer very little in terms of secular subjects. Schools in the Arab sector teach in [[Arabic]] and offer a curriculum that emphasizes Arab history, religion and culture.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} . 

The proportions of pupils attending schools in the Haredi and Arab sectors are increasing; according to a demographic study published in 2009, Haredim and Arabs together will amount to 60% of Israel's elementary school population by 2030. <ref>{{cite news |title=Secular Jews may be minority in Israeli schools by 2030 |author=Ofri Ilani |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/secular-jews-may-be-minority-in-israeli-schools-by-2030-1.277177 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=2009-06-03 |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref> Both Haredim and Arab citizen are under-represented in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] and in the workforce.  . 

The Haredim's lack of mainstream education, and consequent low participation in the workforce, are regarded by many in Israel as a social problem. The Council for Higher Education announced in 2012 that it was investing NIS 180 million over the following five years to establish appropriate frameworks for the education of Haredim, focusing on specific professions. <ref>{{cite news |title=New project to integrate Haredim in higher education |author=Lior Dattel |url=http://www.haaretz.com/business/new-project-to-integrate-haredim-in-higher-education-1.412067 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=2012-02-10 |accessdate=2012-03-02}}</ref> . 

==Israeli Pupils’ Rights Law==. 
Israeli Pupils’ Rights Law of 2000, prohibit discrimination of students for sectarian reasons in admission to or expulsion from an educational institution, in  establishment of separate educational curricula or holding of separate classes in the same educational institution, and   rights and obligations of pupils. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/Zchuyot/ChukimVeamanot/Chukim/PupilsRightsLaw |title=חוק זכויות התלמיד באנגלית - Pupils’ Rights Law |publisher=Cms.education.gov.il |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref> . 

==Bilingual Arab-Jewish schools==. 
In 1984 the first integrated schools which had both Jewish and Arab students to coexist in a classroom were built by the residents of [[Neve Shalom – Wāħat as-Salām]], a cooperative village founded by Arab and Jewish citizens of Israel. Today this school receives some support from the state. Two more integrated schools were opened in Jerusalem and Galilee ([[Galil Jewish-Arab School]]) in 1997 by [[Hand in Hand: Center for Jewish Arab Education in Israel]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Israel+beyond+politics/Third+bilingual+school+for+Israeli+Jews+and+Arabs+opens+its+doors+5-Sep-2004.htm |title=Third bilingual school for Israeli Jews and Arabs opens its doors 5-Sep-2004 |publisher=Mfa.gov.il |date=2004-09-05 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}</ref> By 2010 there are in total five integrated schools in Israel including that of Neve Shalom.  . 

==Matriculation (Bagrut)==. 
[[Image:Bagrut.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Bagrut]] certificate from 1983]] . 

High schools in Israel prepare students for the [[Bagrut|Israeli matriculation exams]] (''bagrut''). These are exams covering various academic disciplines, which are studied in units (''yehidot limud'') of one to five on an ascending scale of difficulty. Students with a passing mark on the mandatory matriculation subjects ([[Hebrew language]], [[English language]], [[mathematics]], [[Religious education|scripture]], [[history]], state studies and [[literature]]), who have been tested on at least 21 units,  and passed at least one 5-unit exam, receive a full matriculation certificate. In 2006/7, 74.4% of Israeli 12th graders took the bagrut exams while only 46.3% were eligible for a matriculation certificate. In the Arab and Druze sectors, the figures were 35.6% and 43.7% respectively. <ref>{{cite news |last=Kashti |first=Or |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1007826.html |title=Less than half of 17-year-olds in Israel qualify for matriculation |newspaper=Haaretz |date=2008-04-02 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}</ref> . 

A Bagrut certificate and Bagrut scores often determine acceptance into elite military units, admission to academic institutions and job prospects. <ref>[http://www.fulbright.org.il/index.php?id=667 Education in Israel]</ref> . 

Below is a table illustrating the percentage of matriculation certificate recipients in Israel's largest [[List of cities in Israel|cities]], according to the [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]] (graduation year of 2002). <ref>http://www.cbs.gov.il/hodaot2005n/06_05_189b.pdf</ref> . 

The [[Adva Center]], a social issues [[think tank]] in Israel, says that about 15% of the matriculation certificates issued do not qualify the recipient for admission to Israel's universities. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adva.org |title=מרכז אדוה - עמוד בית |publisher=Adva.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-10}}</ref> .

==Higher education==. 
{{See also|List of universities and colleges in Israel}}
[[Image:Technion Computer Science Faculty.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Computer science]] Faculty Building<br> in the [[Technion]] - Israel Institute of Technology]]
After secondary education, students are generally conscripted into the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF), but may request an extension of the conscription date to study at a pre-service [[Mechina]], or in a college or university. Those who study in a university at this stage generally do so under a program called ''[[atuda]]'', where the tuition for their [[Bachelor's Degree]] is paid for by the army. They are however obligated to sign a contract with the army extending their service by 2–3 years.  . 

Universities generally require a certain amount of bagrut matriculation units (as well as a certain grade average) and a good grade in the [[Psychometric Entrance Test]], which is similar in many respects to the American SAT. All of Israel's eight public universities, and some colleges, are subsidized by the state, and students pay only a small part of the actual cost as tuition.  . 

The [[Psychometric Entrance Test]] (colloquially known in Hebrew as "'''the Psychometry'''" - ''ha-Psixometri'', הפסיכומטרי) is a [[standardized test]]  used as a [[higher education]] admission exam. The PET covers three areas: [[quantitative reasoning]], [[verbal reasoning]] and the [[English language]]. It is administered by the [[Israeli National Institute for Testing and Evaluation]] (NITE) and is heavily weighed for [[university and college admissions|university admissions]].The test may be taken in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], or combined Hebrew/English.  . 

==Comparisons and rankings==. 
According to the [[Webometrics]] ranking, six of Israel's universities place in the top 100 schools of Asia. <ref>[http://www.webometrics.info/top100_continent.asp?cont=asia Webometrics list of the top 100 Asian universities.]</ref> Four universities place in the top 150 in the world according to the [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]] [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]], and three are in the [[Times Higher Education-QS World University Rankings]] (i.e. amongst the "Top 200 World Universities").  . 

In addition, Israeli universities are among 100 top world universities in science and engineering: [[mathematics]] ([[Tel Aviv University|TAU]], [[Hebrew University]] and [[Technion]]); [[physics]] ([[Tel Aviv University|TAU]], [[Hebrew University]] and [[Weizmann Institute of Science]]); [[chemistry]] ([[Tel Aviv University|TAU]], [[Hebrew University]] and [[Technion]]); [[computer science]] ([[Tel Aviv University|TAU]], [[Hebrew University]], [[Weizmann Institute of Science]], [[Bar Ilan University|BIU]] and [[Technion]]); <ref name="SJTU"> {{cite web |url=http://www.arwu.org/# |title=Academic Ranking of World Universities - 2009 |publisher=Institute of Higher Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University |accessdate=2009-11-14 |year=2009}} </ref> [[Engineering]] (Technion); <ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2009/subject-rankings/technology |title=THE - QS World University Rankings 2009 - Engineering/Technology |publisher=THE - QS|accessdate=2010-01-15|year=2010}}</ref> [[Life sciences]] (Hebrew University). <ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2009/subject-rankings/life-sciences-bio-medicine|title=THE - QS World University Rankings 2009 - Life Sciences & Biomedicine|publisher=THE - QS|accessdate=2010-01-15|year=2010}}</ref> .

==Educational disparity==. 
[[image:Twoteachers.jpg|thumb|250px|Jewish and Arab teachers at [[Hand in Hand: Center for Jewish Arab Education in Israel|Hand in Hand]]]]
Israel is a signatory of the [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]], and ratified it in 1961. The convention has the status of law in Israeli courts. <ref name="hrw">Human Rights Watch, 'Second class: Discrimination against against palestinian arab children in Israel's schools'',  pp 13-16</ref> . 

Israel operates an Arab education system for [[Israeli-Arab]]s  minority that teaches Arab students, in Arabic, about their history and culture. However, there have been claims that the Jewish education system get more resources. According to the Follow-Up Committee for Arab Education, the Israeli government spends an average of $192 per year on each Arab student and $1,100 per Jewish student. It also notes that drop-out rate for Israeli Arab citizens is twice as high as that of their Jewish counterparts (12 percent versus 6 percent). The same group also noted that in 2005 there was a 5,000-classroom shortage in the Arab sector. <ref>{{cite web|title=Arab Sector: NIF Grantees Fight Discrimination in Arab Education|publisher=New Israel Fund|date=2005-09-13|url=http://www.nif.org/content.cfm?id=2343&currbody=1|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070807221918/http://www.nif.org/content.cfm?id=2343&currbody=1|archivedate=2007-08-07}}</ref> . 

In attempt to close the gap between Arab and Jewish education sectors, the Israeli education minister announced an [[affirmative action]] policy, promising that Arabs would be granted 25% of the education budget, more than their proportional share in the population (18%). He also added that the ministry would support the creations of an Arab academic college. <ref>Middle East Contemporary Survey, Volume 23; By Bruce Maddy-Weitzman. p. 329</ref> . 

In 2001 a [[Human Rights Watch]] report stated that students in government-run Arab schools received inferior education due to fewer teachers, inadequate school construction, and lack of  libraries and recreational space. Jewish schools were found to be better equipped, some offering  film editing studios and theater rooms. <ref>[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2001/12/05/isrlpa3399.htm Israeli Schools Separate, Not Equal (Human Rights Watch, 5-12-2001)]</ref> The report found substantial differences in many aspects of the education system. <ref>[http://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/israel2/ISRAEL0901-01.htm Human Rights Watch: Second Class: Discrimination Against Palestinian Arab Children in Israel's Schools - Summary]</ref><ref>[http://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/israel2/ Second Class - Discrimination Against Palestinian Arab Children in Israel's Schools], [[Human Rights Watch]]. </ref> In 2009 Sorel Cahan of [[Hebrew University]]'s School of Education claimed that Israel's [[Ministry of Education (Israel)|Education Ministry]] discriminates against Arabs in its allocations of special assistance for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Cahan wrote that the average per-student allocation at Arab junior high schools was one-fifth lower. <ref name="haaretz.com">{{cite news |last=Kashti |first=Or |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1106955.html |title=Israel aids its needy Jewish students more than Arab counterparts |newspaper=Haaretz |date=2008-04-02 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}</ref> . 

In 2007 the Israeli Education Ministry announced a plan to increase funding for schools in Arab communities. According to a ministry official, "At the end of the process, a lot of money will be directed toward schools with students from families with low education and income levels, mainly in the Arab sector."<ref>{{cite news |title=Israeli Arabs to get greater school funding, settlements less |last=Kashti |first=Or |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/israeli-arabs-to-get-greater-school-funding-settlements-less-1.214753 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=2007-03-06 |accessdate= }}</ref> The Education Ministry prepared a five-year plan to close the gaps and raise the number of students eligible for high school matriculation. <ref>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3958211,00.html Israel's education woes], YNet, 09.21.10, by Tomer Velmer</ref> . 

A 2009 report showed that obstacles to Arab students participating in higher education resulted in over 5,000 moving to study in nearby Jordan. <ref>[http://www.dirasat-aclp.org/arabic/Jordan-Higher_Education.pdf ظﺎﻫرة دراﺴﺔ اﻟطﻼب اﻟﻌرب ﻤن اﺴراﺌﻴل ﻓﻲ اﻟﺠﺎﻤﻌﺎت اﻻردﻨﻴﺔ] Dirasat (in Arabic)</ref><ref>[http://www.thenational.ae/news/worldwide/middle-east/israels-arab-students-are-crossing-to-jordan Israel's Arab students are crossing to Jordan] The National Apr 9, 2009</ref> And in 2010 human rights groups and lawyers criticized a number of measures which were introduced to benefit Jewish secondary school leavers and adversely affected Arab students intending to enroll in higher education. <ref>[http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=20662 No room for Arab students at Israeli universities] Global Research, August 17, 2010</ref> . 

The Ministry of Education announced in April 2010 that the suggested curriculum for the coming school year would not include civics, democratic values or Jewish-Arab coexistence, and focus more on Zionist and Jewish values. <ref>{{cite news |title=Israel's plan for next year's school curriculum: Reinforcing Jewish and Zionist values |author=Or Kashti |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/israel-s-plan-for-next-year-s-school-curriculum-reinforcing-jewish-and-zionist-values-1.355853 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=2011-04-14 |accessdate=2012-03-06}}[</ref> . 

==Status of teachers==. 
Over the years, government budget cuts and underpaid teachers have taken their toll. Israel was amongst the top-ranked nations in international rankings for science and mathematics performance in the 1960s, but dropped to 33 out of 41 nations in the 2002 survey. <ref name="BW">{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_47/b4059074.htm |title=The Crisis in Israel's Classrooms |publisher=Businessweek |date=2007-11-19 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}</ref> Wages for Israeli teachers are low compared to other industrialized countries, especially due to the small amount of frontal teaching hours with respect to other developed countries (The salary per hour is similar to that of the OECD standards), according to a survey of the [[Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development]]. The government-appointed [[Dovrat Commission]], led by [[Shlomo Dovrat]], concluded in 2004, that the key to improving Israeli education is not more money but better-quality teaching. The recommendations included a reform giving school principals the right to fire bad teachers and reward good ones with higher pay. These moves have been blocked by Israel's teachers' unions, which have paralyzed schools with a series of long strikes, mostly blocking the proposed reforms. <ref>[http://www.economist.com/node/10909908?story_id=10909908 Miracles and mirages], The Economist. Apr 3 2008</ref> . 

==Textbooks==. 
{{main|Textbooks in Israel}}
[[Nurit Peled-Elhanan]], a professor of language and education at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] asserts that the books promote negative images of Arabs. The [[Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace]], a schoolbook monitoring organization, disputed this finding, calling her claim heavily politicized and distorted. <ref>Arnon Groiss. Comments on Nurit Peled-Elhanan's paper: "The Presentation of Palestinians in Israeli Schoolbooks of History and Geography 1998-2003". Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace (CMIP-RA)</ref> . 

In a report published in 2000, the Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace stated that in textbooks of both the general state-run network and the religious state-run network, there was a genuine effort to remove stereotypes and to build a foundation for coexistence and mutual respect. <ref name=CMIP_rpt2000>Arabs and Palestinians in Israeli Textbooks, September 2000 Report. by Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace, pp. 7–10</ref> . 

According to a 2011 report by the Arab Cultural Association, Arabic textbooks provided to third grade to ninth grade students in Israeli schools were found to contain many mistakes.  The report was based on a study of textbooks in all subjects. Dr. George Mansour, who examined the history textbooks, said they ignored the presence of Arab-Palestinians in Israel and minimized Arab culture. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/israel-s-textbooks-in-arabic-are-full-of-mistakes-study-finds-1.360617|title=Israel textbooks in Arabic are full of mistakes|publisher=[[Haaretz]] |date= 09.05.11| By Jack Khoury}}</ref> . 

==Strikes==. 
Israeli schools and universities have been subject to repeated strikes over the years by faculty, and, occasionally, students. The 2007 Israeli student strike started in April 2007 in protest at the government decision to increase tuition fees<ref>[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/122362 Student and Teacher Strikes Continue, No End in Sight] Israel National News, 7 May 2007</ref> and the failure to implement the [[Eliyahu Winograd#University students tuition fees|2001 Winograd Committee]] recommendation that they be reduced by 25%. <ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/829640.html Tamir, students union announce cancellation of university strike] Haaretz, 24 February 2007</ref> Students have clashed with police, blocked roads and been arrested. <ref>[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1178198606198&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Education: Striking while the iron is hot] Jerusalem Post, 3 May 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.socialistworld.net/eng/2007/05/08israel.html The ‘red revolution’ for free education]</ref> . 

After three weeks of strikes the presidents of the universities tried to break the strike with the threat that all students who failed to return to their studies on 8 May would have to retake the semester. The student leadership responded by intensifying the strike. <ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/855886.html Students threaten to step up strike, 'seal off' campuses] Haaretz, 6 May 2007</ref> On 7 May students prevented the reopening of the universities by sealing off university entrances with chains. <ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/856570.html Protesting students bar Tel Aviv University with chains and barbed wire] Haaretz, 7 May 2007</ref> Student leaders rejected a compromise proposal by the Israeli Prime Minister which would have exempted current students from the fee rises. <ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/856805.html Student leader: Compromise presented by PMO is 'humiliating']</ref> Divisions amongst students have been reported in the Israeli media. <ref>[http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3397140,00.html Ynet article]</ref> Some students also started a hunger strike. <ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/857724.html Striking students set to expand protest against education reforms]</ref> . 

Negotiations between the Students and the Israeli government have failed to end the strike, despite reported breakthroughs. <ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/860333.html Student union representatives: Strike to continue as planned]</ref> . 

The strike ended on May 14 after Student leaders narrowly agreed a compromise with the government which accepted the implementation of the controversial Shochat reforms. This agreement was unpopular with grassroots student activists. <ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/862569.html Universities to reopen today as 41-day strike ends]</ref> 
Middle and secondary school teachers were on strike for over a month and a half. Their demands include an 8.5% pay raise, reducing class sizes to a maximum of 30 students, and increasing the length of the school day. <ref>[http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=927022&contrassID=2&subContrassID=21 אולמרט: מקווה ששביתת שהמורים תסתיים עד סוף השבוע]</ref> . 

The senior faculty of the [[List of universities and colleges in Israel|universities]] were on strike between the opening of the 2007 autumn semester and mid-December 2007 after the Jewish holiday of Hannukah. The school year, for all the schools who struck, was extended until July 10, 2008.  .
