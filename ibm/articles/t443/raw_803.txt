[[Image:Donetsk park kovanih figur 02.jpg|right|thumb|A [[blacksmith]] is a traditional trade.]] . 

'''Vocational education''' or ''vocational education and training'' (VET) is an education that prepares trainees for jobs at various levels from a craft or trade to a professional position in engineering, accounting, nursing, medicine and other heath practitioners, architecture, pharmacy, law etc.  Craft vocations are usually based on manual or practical activities, traditionally non-[[academics|academic]], related to a specific trade, [[employment|occupation]], or ''[[vocation]]''. It is sometimes referred to as ''technical education'' as the trainee directly develops expertise in a particular group of techniques.  In the UK some higher technician engineering positions that require 4-5 year apprenticeship require academic study to HNC / HND level.  . 

Vocational education may be classified as teaching [[procedural knowledge]]. This can be contrasted with [[declarative knowledge]], as used in education in a usually broader [[science|scientific]] field, which might concentrate on [[theory]] and abstract [[concept]]ual knowledge, characteristic of [[tertiary education]]. Vocational education can be at the [[secondary education|secondary]], [[post-secondary education|post-secondary]] level, [[further education]] level  and can interact with the [[apprenticeship]] system. Increasingly, vocational education can be recognised in terms of [[recognition of prior learning]] and partial [[credit (education)|academic credit]] towards [[tertiary education]] (e.g., at a [[university]]) as credit; however, it is rarely considered in its own form to fall under the traditional definition of [[higher education]].  . 

Vocational education is related to the age-old [[apprenticeship]] system of learning.  Apprenticeships are designed for many levels of work from manual trades to high knowledge work.  . 

However, as the labor market becomes more specialized and economies demand higher levels of skill, governments and businesses are increasingly investing in the future of vocational education through publicly funded training organizations and subsidized apprenticeship or traineeship initiatives for businesses. At the post-secondary level vocational education is typically provided by an [[institute of technology]], or by a local [[community college]].  . 

Vocational education has diversified over the 20th century and now exists in [[industry|industries]] such as [[retailer|retail]], [[tourism]], [[information technology]], [[funeral]] services and [[cosmetics]], as well as in the traditional crafts and [[cottage industry|cottage industries]].  . 

==VET internationally==. 
===Australia=== . 

In [[Australia]] vocational education and training is mostly post-secondary and provided through the vocational education and training (VET) system by [[registered training organisation]]s.  This system encompasses both public, [[TAFE]], and private providers in a national training framework consisting of the [http://www.training.com.au/aqtf2007/ Australian Quality Training Framework], [[Australian Qualifications Framework]] and [http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/training_skills/policy_issues_reviews/key_issues/nts/tpk/ Industry Training Packages] which define the assessment standards for the different vocational qualifications.  . 

Australia’s apprenticeship system includes both traditional apprenticeships in traditional trades and “traineeships” in other more service-oriented occupations. Both involve a legal contract between the employer and the apprentice and provide a combination of school-based and workplace training. Apprenticeships typically last three to four years, traineeships only one to two years. Apprentices and trainees receive a wage which increases as they progress. <ref>http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/27/11/41631383.pdf Learning for Jobs OECD review of Australian vocational education</ref> . 

Since the states and territories are responsible for most public delivery and all regulation of providers, a central concept of the system is "national recognition" whereby the assessments and awards of any one registered training organisation must be recognised by all others and the decisions of any state or territory training authority must be recognised by the other states and territories. This allows national portability of qualifications and units of competency.  . 

A crucial feature of the training package (which accounts for about 60% of publicly-funded training and almost all apprenticeship training) is that the content of the vocational qualifications is theoretically defined by industry and not by government or training providers. A Training Package is "owned" by one of 11 Industry Skills Councils which are responsible for developing and reviewing the qualifications.  . 

The National Centre for Vocational Education Research or NCVER [http://www.ncver.edu.au] is a not-for-profit company owned by the federal, state and territory ministers responsible for training. It is responsible for collecting, managing, analysing, evaluating and communicating research and statistics about vocational education and training (VET).  . 

The boundaries between Vocational education and tertiary education are becoming more blurred. A number of vocational training providers such as [[Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE|NMIT]], [[Box Hill Institute of TAFE|BHI]] and [[William Angliss Institute of TAFE|WAI]] are now offering specialised Bachelor degrees in specific areas not being adequately provided by Universities. Such Applied Courses include in the areas of Equine studies, Winemaking and viticulture, aquaculture, Information Technology, Music, Illustration, Culinary Management and many more. <ref>''[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/07/24/1027332400427.html TAFE gears up to offer degrees]'' By Rebecca Scott, [[The Age]] July 24, 2002. Accessed August 3, 2008</ref> . 

===Commonwealth of Independent States=== . 

The largest and the most unified system of vocational education was created in the [[Soviet Union]] with the [[Professional`no-tehnicheskoye uchilische]] and, [[Tehnikum]]. But it became less effective with the transition of the economies of post-Soviet countries to a [[market economy]].  . 

===Finland=== . 

In [[Finland]], vocational education belongs to secondary education. After the nine-year comprehensive school, almost all students choose to go to either a ''[[Education in Finland|lukio]]'' (high school), which is an institution preparing students for tertiary education, or  to a vocational school. Both forms of secondary education last three years, and give a formal qualification to enter university or ''[[ammattikorkeakoulu]]'', i.e. Finnish polytechnics. In certain fields (e.g. the police school, [[air traffic control]] personnel training), the entrance requirements of vocational schools include completion of the ''lukio'', thus causing the students to complete their secondary education twice.  . 

The education in vocational school is free, and the students from low-income families are eligible for a state student grant. The curriculum is primarily vocational, and the academic part of the curriculum is adapted to the needs of a given course. The vocational schools are mostly maintained by [[municipalities of Finland|municipalities]].  . 

After completing secondary education, one can enter higher vocational schools (''ammattikorkeakoulu'', or ''AMK'') or universities.  . 

It is also possible for a student to choose both lukio and vocational schooling. The education in such cases last usually from 3 to 4 years.  . 

===German language areas=== . 

Vocational education is an important part of the education systems in [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Switzerland]] (including the French and the Italian speaking parts of the country) and one element of the [[German model#Vocational training|German model]].  . 

For example, in Germany a law (the ''Berufsausbildungsgesetz'') was passed in 1969 which regulated and unified the vocational training system and codified the shared responsibility of the state, the unions, associations and chambers of trade and industry. The system is very popular in modern Germany: in 2001, two thirds of young people aged under 22 began an apprenticeship, and 78% of them completed it, meaning that approximately 51% of all young people under 22 have completed an apprenticeship. One in three companies offered apprenticeships in 2003; in 2004 the government signed a pledge with industrial unions that all companies except very small ones must take on apprentices.  . 

The vocational education systems in the other German speaking countries are very similar to the German system and a vocational qualification from one country is generally also recognized in the other states within this area.  . 

===Hong Kong=== . 

In [[Hong Kong]], vocational education is usually for post-secondary 3, 5 and 7 students.  The Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education (IVE) provides training in nine different vocational fields, namely: Applied Science; Business Administration; Child Education and Community Services; Construction; Design; Printing, Textiles and Clothing; Hotel, Service and Tourism Studies; Information Technology; Electrical and Electronic Engineering; and Mechanical, Manufacturing and Industrial Engineering.  . 

===Hungary=== . 

Normally at the end of elementary school (at age 14) students are directed to one of three types of upper secondary education: one academic track (gymnasium) and two vocational tracks.  Vocational secondary schools (szakközépiskola) provide four years of general education and also prepare students for the maturata. These schools combine general education with some specific subjects, referred to as pre-vocational education and career orientation. At that point many students enrol in a post-secondary VET programme often at the same institution, to obtain a vocational qualification, although they may also seek entry to tertiary education.  . 

Vocational training schools (szakiskola) initially provide two years of general education, combined with some pre-vocational education and career orientation, they then choose an occupation, and then receive two or three years of vocational education and training focusing on that occupation – such as bricklayer. Students do not obtain the maturata but a vocational qualification at the end of a successfully completed programme. Demand for vocational training schools, both from the labour market and among students, has declined while it has increased for upper secondary schools delivering the maturata. <ref>http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/24/27/41738329.pdf OECD review of vocational education and training in Hungary</ref> . 

=== India === . 

Vocational training in India is provided on a full time as well as part time basis. Full time programs are generally offered through I.T.I.s [[industrial training institutes]]. The nodal agency for grant the recognition to the I.T.I.s is NCVT which is under the Min. of labour, Govt. of India. Part time programs are offered through state technical education boards or universities who also offer full-time courses. Vocational training has been successful in [[India]] only in industrial training institutes and that too in engineering trades. There are many private institutes in India which offer courses in vocational training and finishing, but most of them have not been recognized by the Government. India is a pioneer in vocational training in Film & Television, and Information Technology.[[AAFT]].Maharashtra State Government also offered vocational Diplomas in various Trades . 
Vocational Higher Secondary schools are under MHRD in India.  All the state governments runs vocational schools.  In kerala state 389 vocational schools are there with 42 different courses.  Commerce & Business, Tourism, Agriculture, Automobile, Air conditioning, Live stock management, Lab Technician are some prominent courses.  Office Secrearyship is a course offering office jobs.  From 2012 June, the vocational Higher Secondary admissions become online in kerala.  . 

===Japan=== . 

[[Japan]]ese vocational schools are known as {{Nihongo|''senmon gakkō''|専門学校}}. They are part of Japan's [[higher education]] system.  They are two year schools that many students study at after finishing high school (although it is not always required that students graduate from high school). Some have a wide range of majors, others only a few majors.  Some examples are [[computer technology]], [[fashion]] and [[English language|English]].  . 

===Korea=== . 

Vocational high schools offer programmes in five fields: agriculture, technology/engineering, commerce/business, maritime/fishery, and home economics. In principle, all students in the first year of high school (10th grade) follow a common national curriculum, In the second and third years (11th and 12th grades) students are offered courses relevant to their specialisation. In some programmes, students may participate in workplace training through co-operation between schools and local employers. The government is now piloting Vocational Meister Schools in which workplace training is an important part of the programme. Around half of all vocational high schools are private. Private and public schools operate according to similar rules; for example, they charge the same fees for high school education, with an exemption for poorer families.  . 

The number of students in vocational high schools has decreased, from about half of students in 1995 down to about one-quarter today. To make vocational high schools more attractive, in April 2007 the Korean government changed the name of vocational high schools into professional high schools. With the change of the name the government also facilitated the entry of vocational high school graduates to colleges and universities.  . 

Most vocational high school students continue into tertiary education; in 2007 43% transferred to junior colleges and 25% to university. At tertiary level, vocational education and training is provided in junior colleges (two- and three-year programmes) and at polytechnic colleges. Education at junior colleges and in two-year programmes in polytechnic colleges leads to an Industrial Associate degree. Polytechnics also provide one-year programmes for craftsmen and master craftsmen and short programmes for employed workers. The requirements for admission to these institutions are in principle the same as those in the rest of tertiary sector (on the basis of the College Scholastic Aptitude Test) but candidates with vocational qualifications are given priority in the admission process. Junior colleges have expanded rapidly in response to demand and in 2006 enrolled around 27% of all tertiary students.  . 

95% of junior college students are in private institutions. Fees charged by private colleges are approximately twice those of public institutions. Polytechnic colleges are state-run institutions under the responsibility of the Ministry of Labour; government funding keeps student fees much lower than those charged by other tertiary institutions. Around 5% of students are enrolled in polytechnic colleges. <ref>http://www.oecd.org/edu/learningforjobs review of Korean vocational education by OECD</ref> . 

===Mexico=== . 

In Mexico, both federal and state governments are responsible for the administration of vocational education. Federal schools are funded by the federal budget, in addition to their own funding sources. The state governments are responsible for the management of decentralised institutions, such as the State Centres for Scientific and Technological Studies (CECyTE) and Institutes of Training for Work (ICAT). These institutions are funded 50% from the federal budget and 50% from the state budget. The state governments also manage and fund "decentralised institutions of the federation", such as CONALEP schools.  . 

Compulsory education (including primary and lower secondary education) finishes at the age of 15 and about half of those aged 15-to-19 are enrolled full-time or part-time in education. All programmes at upper secondary level require the payment of a tuition fee.  . 

The upper secondary vocational education system in Mexico includes over a dozen subsystems (administrative units within the Upper Secondary Education Undersecretariat of the Ministry of Public Education, responsible for vocational programmes) which differ from each other to varying degrees in content, administration, and target group. The large number of school types and corresponding administrative units within the Ministry of Public Education makes the institutional landscape of vocational education and training complex by international standards.  . 

Vocational education and training provided under the Upper Secondary Education Under secretariat includes three main types of programme: . 

* "Training for work" (formación para el trabajo) courses at ISCED 2 level are short training programmes, taking typically 3 to 6 months to complete. The curriculum includes 50% theory and 50% practice. After completing the programme, students may enter the labour market. This programme does not provide direct access to tertiary education. Those who complete lower secondary education may choose between two broad options of vocational upper secondary education at ISCED 3 level. Both programmes normally take three years to complete and offer a vocational degree as well as the baccalaureate, which is required for entry into tertiary education. 
* The title "technical professional – baccalaureate" (profesional técnico - bachiller) is offered by various subsystems though one subsystem (CONALEP) includes two thirds of the students. The programme involves 35% general subjects and 65% vocational subjects. Students are required to complete 360 hours of practical training. 
* The programme awarding the "technological baccalaureate" (bachillerato tecnológico) and the title "professional technician" (técnico professional) is offered by various subsystems. It includes more general and less vocational education: 60% general subjects and 40% vocational subjects. <ref>[http://www.oecd.org/edu/learningforjobs Review of vocational education and training in Mexico]</ref> . 

===New Zealand===. 
New Zealand is served by 39 Industry Training Organsiations(ITO).  The unique element is that ITOs purchase training as well as set standards and aggregate industry opinion about skills in the labour market.  Industry Training, as organised by ITOs, has expanded from apprenticeships to a more true life long learning situation with, for example, over 10% of trainees aged 50 or over.  Moreover much of the training is generic.  This challenges the prevailing idea of vocational education and the standard layperson view that it focuses on apprenticeships.  . 

One source for information in New Zealand is the Industry Training Federation.[http://www.itf.org.nz]. Another is the Ministry of Education .[http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz].  . 

Polytechnics, Private Training Establishments, Wananga and others also deliver vocational training, amongst other areas.  . 

===Norway=== . 

Nearly all those leaving lower secondary school enter upper secondary education, and around half follow one of 9 vocational programmes.  These programmes typically involve two years in school followed by two years of apprenticeship in a company. The first year provides general education alongside introductory knowledge of the vocational area.  During the second year, courses become more trade-specific.  . 

Apprentices receive a wage negotiated in collective agreements ranging between 30% and 80% of the wage of a qualified worker; the percentage increasing over the apprenticeship period. Employers taking on apprentices receive a subsidy, equivalent to the cost of one year in school. 
After the two years vocational school programme some students opt for a third year in the ‘general’ programme as an alternative to an apprenticeship. Both apprenticeship and a third year of practical training in school lead to the same vocational qualifications. Upper secondary VET graduates may go directly to Vocational Technical Colleges, while those who wish to enter university need to take a supplementary year of education.  . 

The social partners participate actively in the development of policy. The National Council for Vocational Education and Training advises the Minister on the development of the national vocational education and training system.  The Advisory Councils for Vocational Education and Training are linked to the nine vocational education programmes provided in upper secondary education and advise on the content of VET programmes and on trends and future skill needs. The National Curriculum groups assist in deciding the contents of the vocational training within the specific occupations. The Local County Vocational Training Committees advise on the quality, provision of VET and career guidance. <ref>http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/45/34/41506628.pdf OECD review of vocational education and training in Norway</ref> . 

===Paraguay=== . 

In [[Paraguay]], vocational education is known as ''Bachillerato Técnico'' and is part of the [[secondary education]] system. These schools combine general education with some specific subjects, referred to as pre-vocational education and career orientation. After nine year of ''Educación Escolar Básica'' (Primary School), the student can choose to go to either a ''Bachillerato Técnico'' (Vocational School) or a ''Bachillerato Científico'' (High School). Both forms of secondary education last three years, and are usually located in the same [[campus]] called ''Colegio''.  . 

After completing secondary education, one can enter to the universities. It is also possible for a student to choose both Técnico and Científico schooling.  . 

===Sweden=== . 

Nearly all of those leaving compulsory schooling immediately enter upper secondary schools, and most complete their upper secondary education in three years. Upper secondary education is divided into 13 vocationally-oriented and 4 academic national programmes. Slightly more than half of all students follow vocational programmes. All programmes offer broad general education and basic eligibility to continue studies at the post-secondary level. In addition, there are local programmes specially designed to meet local needs and ‘individual’ programmes.  . 

A 1992 school reform extended vocational upper secondary programmes by one year, aligning them with three years of general upper secondary education, increasing their general education content, and making core subjects compulsory in all programmes.  The core subjects (which occupy around one-third of total teaching time in both vocational and academic programmes) include English, artistic activities, physical education and health, mathematics, natural science, social studies, Swedish or Swedish as a second language, and religious studies.  In addition to the core subjects, students pursue optional courses, subjects which are specific to each programme and a special project.  . 

Vocational programmes include 15 weeks of workplace training (Arbetsplatsförlagd utbildning – APU) over the three-year period. Schools are responsible for arranging workplace training and verifying its quality. Most municipalities have advisory bodies: programme councils (programmråd) and vocational councils (yrkesråd) composed of employers’ and employees’ representatives from the locality. The councils advise schools on matters such as provision of workplace training courses, equipment purchase and training of supervisors in APU. <ref>http://www.oecd.org/edu/learningforjobs OECD Learning for Jobs review of vocational education in Sweden</ref> . 

===Switzerland=== . 

Nearly two thirds of those entering upper secondary education enter the vocational education and training system. At this level, vocational education and training is mainly provided through the ‘dual system’. Students spend some of their time in a vocational school; some of their time doing an apprenticeship at a host company; and for most programmes, students attend industry courses at an industry training centre to develop complementary practical skills relating to the occupation at hand. Common patterns are for students to spend one- two days per week at the vocational school and three-four days doing the apprenticeship at the host company; alternatively they alternate between some weeks attending classes at the vocational school and some weeks attending industry courses at an industry training centre. A different pattern is to begin the programme with most of the time devoted to in-school education and gradually diminishing the amount of in-school education in favour of more in-company training.  . 

Switzerland draws a distinction between vocational education and training (VET) programmes at upper-secondary level, and professional education and training (PET) programmes, which take place at tertiary B level. In 2007, more than half of the population aged 25–64 had a VET or PET qualification as their highest level of education.    In addition, universities of applied sciences (Fachhochschulen) offer vocational education at tertiary A level.   Pathways enable people to shift from one part of the education system to another. <ref>http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/12/5/42578681.pdf Learning for Jobs OECD review of Switzerland, 2009</ref> . 

=== United Kingdom ===. 
The first "Trades School" in the UK was ''Stanley Technical Trades School'' (now [[Harris Academy South Norwood]]) which was designed, built and set up by [[William Stanley (inventor)|William Stanley]]. The initial idea was thought of in 1901, and the school opened in 1907. <ref name="stanley-nat-biog">{{cite book |last=Owen |first=W.B. |title=[[Dictionary of National Biography]]&nbsp;– William Ford Robinson Stanley |editor=Sir [[Sidney Lee]] |publisher=[[Smith, Elder & Co]] |location=London |year=1912 |series=Second Supplement |volume=III (NEIL-YOUNG) |pages=393–394 |accessdate=22 August 2010 |subst=subst:}}</ref> . 

The system of vocational education in the UK initially developed independently of the state, with bodies such as the [[Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures & Commerce|RSA]] and [[City & Guilds]] setting examinations for technical subjects. The [[Education Act 1944]] made provision for a [[Tripartite System]] of [[grammar school]]s, [[secondary technical school]]s and [[secondary modern school]]s, but by 1975 only 0.5% of British senior pupils were in technical schools, compared to two-thirds of the equivalent German age group. <ref name="Wolf">Wolf, A. (2002) ''Does Education Matter? Myths about Education and Economic Growth'' London: Penguin. </ref> . 

Successive recent [[HM Government|British Governments]] have made attempts to promote and expand vocational education. In the 1970s, the [[Business And Technology Education Council (BTEC)|Business And Technology Education Council]] was founded to confer [[further education|further]] and [[higher education]] awards, particularly to [[further education]] colleges in the United Kingdom. In the 1980s and 1990s, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Government promoted the [[Youth Training Scheme]], [[National Vocational Qualification]]s and [[General National Vocational Qualification]]s. However, youth training was marginalised as the proportion of young people staying on in [[Education in the United Kingdom|full-time education]] increased. <ref name="Wolf"/> . 

In 1994, publicly-funded [[Apprenticeships#United Kingdom|Modern Apprenticeships]] were introduced to provide "quality training on a work-based (educational) route". <ref>[http://www.keele.ac.uk/depts/so/youthchron/Education/9197educ.htm Youth Policies in the UK<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Numbers of apprentices have grown in recent years and the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] has stated its intention to make apprenticeships a "mainstream" part of [[England]]'s education system. <ref name="World Class Apprenticeships">World Class Apprenticeships.
