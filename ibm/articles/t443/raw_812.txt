A '''school''' is an [[institution]] designed for the teaching of [[student]]s (or "pupils") under the direction of [[teacher]]s. Most countries have systems of formal [[education]], which is commonly [[compulsory education|compulsory]]. In these systems, students progress through a series of schools. The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the ''Regional'' section below), but generally include [[primary school]] for young children and [[secondary school]] for teenagers who have completed primary education. An institution where [[higher education]] is taught, is commonly called a [[university college]] or [[university]].  . 

In addition to these core schools, students in a given country may also attend schools before and after primary and secondary education. [[Kindergarten]] or [[education|pre-school]] provide some schooling to very young children (typically ages 3–5). [[University]], [[vocational school]], [[college]] or [[seminary]] may be available after secondary school. A school may also be dedicated to one particular field, such as a school of economics or a school of dance. [[Alternative school]]s may provide nontraditional curriculum and methods.  . 

There are also non-government schools, called private schools. Private schools may be required when the government does not supply adequate, or special education. Other private schools can also be religious, such as [[Christian school]]s, [[hawza]]s, [[yeshiva]]s, and others; or schools that have a higher standard of education or seek to foster other personal achievements. Schools for adults include institutions of [[corporate training]], [[Military education and training]] and [[business schools]].  . 

In [[homeschooling]] and [[E-learning|online school]]s, teaching and learning take place outside of a traditional school building.  . 

==Etymology==. 
The word ''school'' derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|σχολή}} '' ({{lang|grc-Latn|scholē}}''), originally meaning "[[leisure]]" and also "that in which leisure is employed", but later "a group to whom lectures were given, school". <ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=school Online Etymology Dictionary]; [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%23101960 H.G.

==History and development of schools==. 
{{Main|History of education}}
[[Image:Plato's Academy mosaic from Pompeii.jpg|thumb|[[Plato]]'s academy, [[mosaic]] from [[Pompeii]].]]
The concept of grouping students together in a centralized location for learning has existed since [[Classical antiquity]]. Formal schools have existed at least since [[ancient Greece]] (see [[Academy]]), [[ancient Rome]] (see [[Education in Ancient Rome]]) [[History of India|ancient India]] (see [[Gurukul]]), and [[History of China|ancient China]] (see [[History of education in China]]). The [[Byzantine Empire]] had an established schooling system beginning at the primary level. According to ''Traditions and Encounters'', the founding of the primary education system began in 425 AD and "...&nbsp;[[Soldier|military personnel]] usually had at least a primary education&nbsp;...". The sometimes efficient and often large government of the Empire meant that educated citizens were a must. Although Byzantium lost much of the grandeur of Roman culture and extravagance in the process of surviving, the Empire emphasized efficiency in its war manuals. The Byzantine education system continued until the empire's collapse in 1453 AD. <ref>{{cite book|last=Bentley|first=Jerry H.|title=Traditions & Encounters a Global Perspective on the Past|location=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hil|year=2006|page=331}}</ref> . 

[[Islam]] was another culture that developed a school system in the modern sense of the word. Emphasis was put on knowledge, which required a systematic way of teaching and spreading knowledge, and purpose-built structures. At first, [[mosque]]s combined both religious performance and learning activities, but by the ninth century, the [[Madrassa]] was introduced, a proper school that was built independently from the mosque. They were also the first to make the ''Madrassa'' system a public domain under the control of the [[Caliph]]. The [[Nizamiyya]] madrasa is considered by consensus of scholars to be the earliest surviving school, built towards 1066 AD by Emir [[Nizam al-Mulk|Nizam Al-Mulk]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} . 

Under the [[Ottomans]], the towns of [[Bursa]] and [[Edirne]] became the main centers of learning. The Ottoman system of [[Külliye]], a building complex containing a mosque, a hospital, madrassa, and public kitchen and dining areas, revolutionized the education system, making learning accessible to a wider public through its free meals, [[health care]] and sometimes free accommodation. 
[[Image:FSA school in Alabama.gif|thumb|One-room school in 1935, [[Alabama]]]]
The nineteenth century historian, Scott holds that a remarkable correspondence exists between the procedure established by those institutions and the methods of the present day. They had their collegiate courses, their prizes for proficiency in scholarship, their oratorical and poetical contests, their commencements and their degrees. In the department of medicine, a severe and prolonged examination, conducted by the most eminent physicians of the capital, was exacted of all candidates desirous of practicing their profession, and such as were unable to stand the test were formally pronounced incompetent. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} . 

In [[Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]] and much of the [[Early Modern]] period, the main purpose of schools (as opposed to universities) was to teach the [[Latin|Latin language]]. This led to the term [[grammar school]], which in the United States informally refers to a primary school, but in the United Kingdom means a school that selects entrants based on ability or aptitude. Following this, the school curriculum has gradually broadened to include literacy in the vernacular language as well as technical, artistic, scientific and practical subjects.

Many of the earlier public schools in the United States were [[one-room school]]s where a single teacher taught seven grades of boys and girls in the same classroom. Beginning in the 1920s, one-room schools were consolidated into multiple classroom facilities with transportation increasingly provided by [[kid hack]]s and [[school bus]]es.  . 

==Regional terms==.

The use of the term ''school'' varies by country, as do the names of the various levels of education within the country.  . 

===United Kingdom and Commonwealth of Nations===. 
In the [[United Kingdom]], the term ''school'' refers primarily to pre-[[university]] institutions, and these can, for the most part, be divided into [[pre-school]]s or [[nursery school]]s, [[primary school]]s (sometimes further divided into [[infant school]] and [[junior school]]), and [[secondary school]]s. Various types of secondary schools in England and Wales include [[grammar school]]s, [[comprehensive school|comprehensives]], [[secondary modern]]s, and [[Academy (England)|city academies]]. In Scotland, while they may have different names, all Secondary schools are the same, except in that they may be funded by the state, or independently funded (see next paragraph). It is unclear if "Academies", which are a hybrid between state and independently funded/controlled schools and have been introduced to England in recent years, will ever be introduced to Scotland. School performance in Scotland is monitored by [[Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education]]. [[Ofsted]] reports on performance in England and [[Estyn]] reports on performance in Wales.  . 

In the United Kingdom, most schools are publicly funded and known as [[state schools]] or maintained schools in which tuition is provided free. There are also private schools or [[Independent school (UK)|independent schools]] that charge fees. Some of the most selective and expensive private schools are known as [[Public school (UK)|public schools]], a usage that can be confusing to speakers of [[North American English]]. In North American usage, a [[public school (government funded)|public school]] is one that is publicly funded or run.  . 

In much of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], including [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[South Africa]], [[Kenya]], and [[Tanzania]], the term ''school'' refers primarily to pre-[[university]] institutions.  . 

===India===. 
[[File:Nepalese school.jpg|thumb|Nepalese teacher and schoolchildren in Pokhara]]
In ancient India, schools were in the form of [[Gurukul]]s. Gurukuls were traditional [[Hindu]] residential schools of learning; typically the teacher's house or a monastery. During the Mughal rule, [[Madrasah]]s were introduced in India to educate the children of Muslim parents. British records show that indigenous education was widespread in the 18th century, with a school for every temple, mosque or village in most regions of the country. The subjects taught included Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Theology, Law, Astronomy, Metaphysics, Ethics, Medical Science and Religion.  . 

Under the British rule in India, Christian missionaries from England, USA and other countries established missionary and boarding schools throughout the country. Later as these schools gained in popularity, more were started and some gained prestige. These schools marked the beginning of modern schooling in India and the syllabus and calendar they followed became the benchmark for schools in modern India. Today most of the schools follow the missionary school model in terms of tutoring, subject / syllabus, governance etc.with minor changes. Schools in India range from schools with large campuses with thousands of students and hefty fees to schools where children are taught under a tree with a small / no campus and are totally free of cost. There are various boards of schools in India, namely [[Central Board for Secondary Education]] (CBSE), Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), Madrasa Boards of various states, Matriculation Boards of various states, State Boards of various boards, Anglo Indian Board, and so on. The typical syllabus today includes Language(s), Mathematics, Science - Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, History, General Knowledge, Information Technology / Computer Science etc.. Extra curricular activities include physical education / sports and cultural activities like music, choreography, painting, theater / drama etc.  . 

===Europe===. 
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F079063-0034, Bonn, Gymnasium, Chemieunterricht.jpg|thumb|Chemistry lesson at a [[Gymnasium (Germany)|German Gymnasium]], Bonn, 1988]]
In much of continental [[Europe]], the term ''school'' usually applies to [[primary education]], with primary schools that last between four and nine years, depending on the country. It also applies to [[secondary education]], with secondary schools often divided between ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasiums]]'' and [[vocational school]]s, which again depending on country and type of school educate students for between three and six years. In Germany students graduating from Grundschule are not allowed to directly progress into a vocational school, but are supposed to proceed to one of Germany's general education schools such as [[Gesamtschule]], [[Hauptschule]], [[Realschule]] or [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]. When they leave that school, which usually happens at age 15-19 they are allowed to proceed to a vocational school. The term school is rarely used for [[tertiary education]], except for some ''upper'' or ''high'' schools (German: Hochschule), which describe [[college]]s and universities.  . 

In [[Eastern Europe]] modern schools (after [[World War II]]), of both primary and secondary educations, often are combined, while secondary education might be split into accomplished or not. The schools are classified as middle schools of general education and for the technical purposes include "degrees" of the education they provide out of three available: the first - primary, the second - unaccomplished secondary, and the third - accomplished secondary. Usually the first two degrees of education (eight years) are always included, while the last one (two years) gives option for the students to pursue [[vocational education|vocational]] or specialized educations.  . 

===North America and the United States===. 
{{Unbalanced|Education related article|date=November 2011}}
In [[North America]], the term ''school'' can refer to any educational institution at any level, and covers all of the following: [[preschool]] (for [[toddler]]s), [[kindergarten]], [[elementary school]], [[middle school]] (also called intermediate school or junior high school, depending on specific age groups and geographic region), [[senior high school]], [[college]], [[university]], and [[graduate school]].  . 

In the [[United States|US]], school performance through high school is monitored by each state's [[State education agency|Department of Education]]. [[Charter schools]] are publicly funded elementary or secondary schools that have been freed from some of the rules, regulations, and statutes that apply to other public schools. The terms [[grammar school]] and ''grade school'' are sometimes used to refer to a primary school.  . 

==School ownership and operation==. 
Many schools are owned or funded by [[state (polity)|states]]. [[Private school]]s operate independently from the government. Private schools usually rely on fees from families whose children attend the school for funding; however, sometimes such schools also receive government support (for example, through [[School voucher]]s). Many private schools are affiliated with a particular religion; these are known as [[parochial schools]].  . 

==Components of most schools==. 
[[Image:rathaykentst.jpg|thumb|A school entrance building in [[Australia]]]]
Schools are organized spaces purposed for teaching and learning. The [[classroom]]s, where teachers teach and students learn, are of central importance, but typical schools have many other areas, which may include: . 

* [[Cafeteria]] (Commons), dining hall or canteen where students eat [[lunch]] and often [[breakfast]] and snacks. 
* Athletic field, playground, [[gym]], and/or track place where students participating in [[sports]] or [[physical education]] practice
* [[Auditorium]] or hall where student theatrical and musical productions can be staged and where all-school events such as assemblies are held
* [[Office]] where the administrative work of the school is done
* [[Library]] where students consult and check out books and magazines and often use computers
* Specialized classrooms including [[laboratories]] for science education
* [[Computer labs]] where computer-based work is done and the internet accessed . 

==School security==. 
[[Image:Warning signs at CHS.jpg|thumb|To curtail violence, some schools have added [[CCTV]] [[surveillance]] cameras. This is especially common in schools with excessive gang activity or violence.]]
The safety of staff and students is increasingly becoming an issue for school communities, an issue most schools are addressing through improved security. After mass shootings such as the [[Columbine High School massacre]] and the [[Virginia Tech massacre|Virginia Tech incident]], many school administrators in the United States have created plans to protect students and staff in the event of a [[school shooting]]. Some have also taken measures such as installing [[metal detectors#Security screening|metal detectors]] or [[video surveillance]]. Others have even taken measures such as having the children swipe identification cards as they board the school bus. For some schools, these plans have included the use of [[door numbering]] to aid public safety response.  . 

Other security concerns faced by schools include [[bomb threat]]s, [[gang]]s, [[vandalism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrensolutions.com/EducationBlog/tabid/532/EntryID/55/Default.aspx |title=School Vandalism Takes Its Toll |publisher=Wrensolutions.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-03}}</ref> and [[bullying]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schoolsecurity.org/trends/bullying.html |title=Bulling, Anti-bullying Legislation, and School Safety |publisher=Schoolsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-03}}</ref> . 

==School health services==. 
{{Main|School health services}} . 

School health services are services from medical, teaching and other professionals applied in or out of school to improve the health and well-being of children and in some cases whole families. These services have been developed in different ways around the globe but the fundamentals are constant: the early detection, correction, prevention or amelioration of disease, disability and abuse from which school aged children can suffer.  . 

==Online schools and classes==. 
{{Main|Virtual school}}
Some schools offer remote access to their classes over the Internet. Online schools also can provide support to traditional schools, as in the case of the [[School Net Namibia]]. 
Some online classes provide experience in a class so that when you take it you have already been introduced to the subject and know what to expect, and even more classes provide High School/College credit allowing you to take the class at your own pace. Many online classes cost money to use but some are offered free.  . 

==Stress==. 
As a profession, teaching has levels of Work-Related Stress (WRS)<ref name="WRS">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrsrecovery.com/ |title=Work-Related Stress in teaching |publisher=Wrsrecovery.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-03}}</ref> that are among the highest of any profession in some countries, such as the United Kingdom. The degree of this problem is becoming increasingly recognized and support systems are being put into place. <ref name="TSN">{{cite web|url=http://www.teachersupport.info/ |title=Teacher Support for England & Wales |publisher=Teachersupport.info |date= |accessdate=2009-10-03}}</ref><ref name="TSNs">{{cite web|url=http://www.teachersupport.info/scotland |title=Teacher Support for Scotland |publisher=Teachersupport.info |date= |accessdate=2009-10-03}}</ref> [[Teacher education]] increasingly recognizes the need to train those new to the profession to be aware of and overcome mental health challenges they may face.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} . 

Stress sometimes affects students more severely than teachers, up to the point where the students are prescribed stress medication. This stress is claimed to be related to standardized testing, and the pressure on students to score above average. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/morgue/2005/2005_05_06.stress06.shtml |title=Survey confirms student stress, but next step is unclear (May 06, 2005) |publisher=Paloaltoonline.com |date=2005-05-06 |accessdate=2009-10-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/parenting/guide/school-stress-anxiety-children |title=Children & School Anxiety, Stress Management |publisher=Webmd.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-28}}</ref> ''See [[Cram school]]''.

==Discipline==. 
{{Main|School discipline}}
Schools and their teachers have always been under pressure — for instance, pressure to cover the curriculum, to perform well in comparison to other schools, and to avoid the stigma of being "soft" or "spoiling" toward students. Forms of discipline, such as control over when students may speak, and normalized behaviour, such as raising a hand to speak, are imposed in the name of greater efficiency. Practitioners of [[critical pedagogy]] maintain that such disciplinary measures have no positive effect on student learning. Indeed, some argue that disciplinary practices detract from learning, saying that they undermine students' individual dignity and sense of [[Self-esteem|self-worth]]&mdash;the latter occupying a more primary role in students' [[hierarchy of needs]].  .
