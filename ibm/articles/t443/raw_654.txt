The '''National Education Association''' ('''NEA''') is the largest [[professional organization]] and largest [[trade union|labor union]] in the [[United States]],<ref name="nea.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.org |title=Home |publisher=NEA |date=2010-02-06 |accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref><ref name="unionfacts.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.unionfacts.com/unions/unionProfile.cfm?id=342 |title=National Education Association (NEA) |publisher=Unionfacts.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref> representing [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] [[teacher]]s and other support personnel, faculty and staffers at [[colleges]] and [[universities]], retired educators, and college students preparing to become teachers. The NEA has 3.2 million members and is headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]] With [[List of education trade unions|affiliate organizations in every state]] and in more than 14,000 communities across the nation, it employs over 550 staff and had a budget of more than $307 million for the 2006–2007 fiscal year. [[Dennis Van Roekel]] is the NEA's current president.  . 

NEA, which describes itself as a professional employee organization,<ref name="nea.org"/> is incorporated as a [[professional association]] in a few states and as a [[labor union]] in most. The group holds a [[congressional charter]] under [[Title 36 of the United States Code]]. It is not a member of the [[AFL-CIO]], but is part of [[Education International]], the global federation of teachers' unions. The NEA is a major funder of [[American liberalism|liberal]] organizations and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], and has been frequently criticized for opposition to some types of [[education reform]]. <ref name="unionfacts.com"/> . 

==Mission==. 
The stated mission of the National Education Association is "to [[advocate]] for education professionals and to unite our members and the nation to fulfill the promise of public education to prepare every student to succeed in a diverse and interdependent world,"<ref>{{cite journal

The NEA is a [[volunteer]]-based organization that relies upon its members to perform much of the Association's work. In turn, the members are supported by a network of staff at the local, state, and national levels. The stated goal of NEA's work is encapsulated in its vision: "building great public schools for every student."<ref name="nea.org"/> . 

At the local level, [[affiliates]] perform a variety of activities (as determined by the local members), which may range from raising funds for scholarship programs to conducting professional workshops on issues that affect faculty and school support staff to bargaining contracts for school district employees. <ref name=autogenerated5>[http://www.nea.org/aboutnea/whatwedo.html NEA: About NEA]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref> . 

The activities of NEA state affiliates are equally wide-ranging. State affiliates regularly [[lobbying|lobby]] state [[legislators]] for [[funding]] and other resources; they seek to influence education policy; they [[political campaign|campaign]] for higher professional standards for educators and support professionals; and, they file legal actions to protect [[academic freedom]] and the [[Workers rights|rights]] of school employees. <ref name=autogenerated5 /> The extent to which the NEA and its state and local affiliates engage in political activities, especially during election cycles has, however, been a source of controversy. <ref>{{cite web|author=Post |url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110005378 |title=The Wall Street Journal Online - Leisure & Arts |publisher=Opinionjournal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=11785 |title=Human Events |publisher=Human Events |date=2006-01-23 |accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110007761 |title=The Wall Street Journal Online - Featured Article |publisher=Opinionjournal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref> From 1989 to 2010 the NEA has spent approximately 36 million dollars on lobbying efforts according to the [[Center for Responsive Politics]]. <ref>[http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/list.php OpenSecrets.org]; Center for Responsive Politics</ref>  . 

At the national level, the NEA lobbies the [[United States Congress]] and [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agencies]] on behalf of its members and public schools, works with other education organizations and friends of public education, provides training and assistance to its affiliates, and generally conducts activities consistent with the policies set by its elected governing bodies. <ref name=autogenerated5 /> . 

==Structure and governance==. 
NEA's 3.2 million members are served by 14,000 local affiliates (including some 800 higher education affiliates), 51 state-level affiliates (50 state associations and the Federal Education Association), and roughly 555 staff members working at its headquarters in Washington, D.C., and in regional offices. <ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.nea.org/topics/truth.html NEA: A Response to Critics]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref> . 

===Representative Assembly===. 
NEA members themselves set Association policy, most notably through the Representative Assembly or "RA." The RA—a delegation comprising elected representatives from each local and state affiliate, coalitions of student members and retired members, and other segments of the united education profession—is the primary legislative and policymaking body of the Association. The RA meets annually the first week of July to adopt a strategic plan and budget, make resolutions, and develop other policies that guide the work of the Association. Those delegates with full voting rights also elect the executive officers, Executive Committee members, and at-large members of the NEA Board of Directors as appropriate. The RA is the largest [[democratic]] [[deliberative assembly]] in the world and adheres to [[Roberts Rules of Order]]. <ref name=autogenerated1>NEA (2007) p15</ref> . 

===Executive Officers, Board of Directors and Executive Committee===. 
The executive officers of the Association are Dennis Van Roekel, President; [[Lily Eskelsen]], Vice President; and, Rebecca Pringle, Secretary-Treasurer. These three posts are elected by the Representative Assembly. <ref name=autogenerated1 /> . 

The [[Board of Directors]] and Executive Committee are responsible for the general policies and interests of the Association, and are subject to policies established by the Representative Assembly. The Board of Directors consists of one director from each state affiliate (plus an additional director for every 20,000 active members in the state), six directors for the Retired members, and three directors for the Student members. The Board also includes at-large representatives of ethnic minorities, administrators, classroom teachers in higher education, and active members employed in educational support positions. The Executive Committee consists of nine members: the three executive officers and six members elected at large by delegates to the Representative Assembly. The executive officers and other members of the Executive Committee are ex officio members of the Board of Directors. <ref>NEA (2007) p15-16</ref> . 

==History==. 
===Early history===. 
Prior to the NEA's founding, teachers had formed professional associations in 15 individual states, but there was no cohesive national association uniting them. That changed in 1857 when Thomas W. Valentine, president of the [[New York State United Teachers|New York State Teachers Association]], issued a nation-wide invitation to teachers to unite behind a common voice for America's growing public school system. The National Teachers Association (NTA) was born. Initial membership was close to 100. <ref>[http://www.nea.org/aboutnea/thecall.html NEA: Gallery, NEA History, The Call]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref> . 

Even though minority educators were able to join the Association from the start, women were barred from joining until 1866. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/neatoday/0602/neahistory2.html |title=NEA Today |publisher=Nea.org |date=1911-03-25 |accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref> Over the ensuing decades the Association became a leading voice in the national movement for [[women's rights]]. It elected its first female president, [[Ella Flagg Young]], in 1910, a decade before Congress granted [[voting rights]] to women. <ref>[http://www.nea.org/aboutnea/efyoung.html ]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref> . 

NTA became the National Education Association (NEA) in 1870 when it merged with the American Normal School Association, the National Association of School Superintendents, and the Central College Association. <ref name=autogenerated6>[http://www.nea.org/aboutnea/neatimeline.html NEA: Timeline, 1857-1965, Historical Events in NEA's History]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref> . 

In 1898, the NEA backed the [[English language spelling reform|English spelling reform]] movement and adopted a list of 12 reformed spellings to be used immediately. These were: ''though→tho, although→altho, thorough→thoro, thoroughfare→thorofare, through→thru, throughout→thruout, catalogue→catalog, decalogue→decalog, demagogue→demagog, pedagogue→pedagog, prologue→prolog, programme→program''. <ref>''Handbook of Simplified Spelling'', [[Simplified Spelling Board]], 1920. p.14</ref> . 

It was [[Congressional charter|chartered]] by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1906.  . 

On its 100th birthday in 1957, NEA had over 700,000 members. <ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/neatoday/0603/neahistory3.html |title=March 2006 NEA Today - Answering the Call Part 3 |publisher=NEA |date=1911-03-25 |accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref> . 

===NEA-ATA merger===. 
NEA merged officially with the [[American Teachers Association]], the historically Black teachers association originally founded as the [[National Association of Teachers in Colored Schools]] (NATCS), in 1966. Mutual interests had fostered a close working relationship between the two organizations over several decades before that. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/neatoday/0604/history4.html |title=April 2006 NEA Today - Answering the Call: The History of the |publisher=NEA |date=1911-03-25 |accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref> . 

In 1926 the two organizations formed a Joint Committee of members of both organizations that was tasked with studying the lack of [[Educational accreditation|accreditation]] of Black high schools, which blocked Black students from acceptance in many colleges and universities. <ref name=autogenerated4 /> Eventually, the Committee garnered evaluation and accreditation for Black high schools. It also advocated for equal school funding, collected data on the status of Black education, and promoted fair treatment of Blacks in textbooks while pressuring publishers to do so. <ref>[http://www.nea.org/aboutnea/atahistory2.html NEA: ATA's Story, Joint Committee]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref> . 

Although [[racial segregation]] in public schools was still the norm, NEA advocated for change. In the 1940s, the Association had refused to hold Representative Assemblies in cities that discriminated against delegates based on race. It had also affiliated with 18 Black teacher's associations in states where Black teachers were prohibited from joining White organizations. <ref>[http://www.nea.org/aboutnea/atatimeline.html NEA: Timeline, ATA History]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref> . 

Finally, in 1966, after more than 20 years of collaboration, cooperation and planning, NEA and ATA agreed to a merger at the RA in Miami Beach, Fla.  . 

===NEA-AFT partnership===. 
In 1998, a tentative agreement to merge was reached between NEA and [[American Federation of Teachers]] negotiators, but [[ratification]] failed soundly in the NEA's Representative Assembly meeting in [[New Orleans]] in early July 1998. <ref>Wayne J. Urban, "Teacher Politics," In ''Teacher Unions and Education Policy: Retrenchment or Reform?'' (eds. Ronald D. Henderson, Wayne J. Urban, and Paul Wolman), Emerald Group, 2004. p. 113-116. </ref> However, four NEA state affiliates have merged with their AFT counterparts. Mergers occurred in [[Florida]] (the [[Florida Education Association]] formed in 1998); [[Minnesota]] ([[Education Minnesota]] formed in 1998), [[Montana]] ([[MEA-MFT]] formed in 2000), and [[New York]] ([[New York State United Teachers]] formed in 2006).  . 

Further, NEA and AFT continue to cooperate and work towards common goals through the "NEAFT Partnership." This Partnership leaves each organization free to differ and to conduct work separately and independently, but enables the two groups to collaborate at every level of each organization. <ref>[http://www.nea.org/aboutnea/NEAFTPartnership.html NEA: NEAFT Partnership]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref> . 

===Recent growth===. 
Before the 1960s, only a small portion of public school teachers were unionized. <ref name="hoover1">[http://www.hoover.org/publications/ednext/3384186.html ]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref> But that began to change when, in 1959, [[Wisconsin]] became the first state to pass a [[collective bargaining]] law for public employees. Over the next 20 years, most other states adopted similar laws. The passage of these laws had a significant impact on NEA, which began to serve members as a labor union, in addition to serving members as a professional association. Passage of these new [[labor laws]], along with NEA's new role as a labor union, helped NEA membership grow from 766,000 in 1961 <ref name="hoover1"/> to roughly 3.2 million today.  . 

In the 1960s, the NEA's demographics were changing. This was due the merger with ATA and the decision to become a true labor union, among other factors. <ref>Gender, Race, and the National Education Association: Professionalism and Its Limitations. By Wayne J. Urban. New York: Routledge, 2000. </ref>  In 1967, the NEA elected its first Hispanic president [[Braulio Alonso]].  In 1968, NEA elected its first Black president, [[Elizabeth Duncan Koontz]]. <ref>New York Times obit - http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/08/us/elizabeth-koontz-69-dies-led-teachers-union.html</ref> . 

In 2006, the NEA and the [[AFL-CIO]] also announced that, for the first time, stand-alone NEA locals as well as those that had merged with the AFT would be allowed to join state and local labor federations affiliated with the AFL-CIO. <ref>{{cite web|author=By 8:46 p.m., Tuesday, February 14, 2006 |url=http://washingtontimes.com/business/20060214-084613-4307r.htm |title=Teachers local allowed to join AFL-CIO |publisher=Washington Times |date=2006-02-14 |accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref> . 

In 2007, at the 150th anniversary of its founding, NEA membership had grown to 3.2 million.  .

* 1989—1996 [[Keith Geiger]]
* 1996—2002 [[Bob Chase]]
* 2002—2008 [[Reg Weaver]]
* 2008–present [[Dennis Van Roekel]]<ref>(for a full list from 1857 on, see https://sites.nea.org/aboutnea/neapres1.html)</ref> . 

==Funding==. 
Most NEA funding comes from dues paid by its members ($295 million in dues from a $341 million total budget in 2005). <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/PaulWeyrich/2006/04/12/secretary_of_labor_elaine_chao_%E2%80%93_a_lady_of_achievement |title=Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao – A Lady of Achievement::By Paul Weyrich |publisher=Townhall.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref> Typically, local chapters negotiate a contract with automatic deduction of dues from members' paychecks.  Part of the dues remain with the local affiliate (the district association), part will go to the state association, and part will move on to the national association.  Although dues moves through the state and national associations, a large portion typically comes back to the local chapters through grants.  . 

Federal law prohibits unions from using dues money or other assets to contribute to or otherwise assist federal candidates or political parties, in accordance with their tax-exempt status.  The [[NEA Fund for Children and Public Education]] is a special fund for voluntary contributions from NEA members which can legally be used to assist candidates and political parties.  Critics have repeatedly questioned the NEA's actual compliance with such laws, and a number of legal actions focusing on the union's use of money and union personnel in partisan contexts have ensued. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.landmarklegal.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=161 |title=Landmark Legal Foundation |publisher=Landmarklegal.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref> .

NEA has played a role in politics since its founding, as it has sought to influence state and federal laws that would have an impact on public education. Every political position adopted by NEA was brought by one of its members to the annual Representative Assembly, where it was considered on the floor, debated, and voted on by elected delegates.  . 

The organization tracks legislation related to education and the teaching profession and encourages members to get involved in politics through a comprehensive Legislative Action Center on its website. 
* 1912: NEA endorses [[Women's Suffrage]]
* 1919: NEA members in New Jersey lead the way to the nation's first state [[pension]]; by 1945, every state had a pension plan in effect
* 1941: NEA successfully lobbied Congress for special funding for public schools near military bases
* 1945: NEA lobbied for the [[G.I. Bill of Rights]] to help returning soldiers continue their education
* 1958: NEA helps gain passage of the [[National Defense Education Act]]
* 1964: NEA lobbies to pass the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]]
* 1968: NEA leads an effort to establish the [[Bilingual Education Act]]
* 1974: NEA backs a case heard before the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] that proposes to make unlawful the firing of pregnant teachers or forced maternity leave
* 1984: NEA fights for and wins passage of a federal retirement equity law that provides the means to end sex discrimination against women in retirement funds
* 2000s: NEA has lobbied for changes to the [[No Child Left Behind Act]]
* 2009: NEA delegates to the Representative Assembly pass a resolution that opposes the discriminatory treatment of same-sex couples. <ref>http://www.nea.org/grants/33354.htm</ref> . 

In recent decades the NEA has increased its visibility in party politics, endorsing more Democratic Party candidates and contributing funds and other assistance to political campaigns. The NEA asserts itself as "non-partisan", but critics point out that the NEA has endorsed and provided support for every [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] [[president]]ial nominee from [[Jimmy Carter]] to [[Barack Obama]] and has never endorsed any [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] or third party candidate for the presidency. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-07-05-nea-kerry_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=NEA endorses Kerry for president | date=2004-07-06}}</ref><ref>http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110007761</ref>  However, NEA has endorsed and supported Republican political candidates for Congressional and Gubernatorial offices. In 2006, NEA funded over 300 candidates, a list which included Democrats, Republicans and Independents, such as [[Mike Simpson]], [[Richard Lugar]], [[Olympia Snowe]], Jim Gerlach, [[John M. McHugh]] and [[Bernard Sanders]], among others.  . 

Based on required filings with the federal government, it is estimated that between 1990 and 2002 eighty percent of the NEA's substantial political contributions went to Democratic Party candidates.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Although this has been questioned as being out of balance with the more diverse political views of the broader membership,<ref>[http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=95000771 The Wall Street Journal Online - Featured Article<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> the NEA maintains that it bases support for candidates primarily on the organization's interpretation of candidates' support for public education and educators. Every Presidential candidate endorsed by NEA must be approved by majority vote among the members themselves at NEA's annual Representative Assembly.  . 

Others benefitting from NEA funding, according to the most recent filings, include [[Jesse Jackson|Jesse Jackson's]] [[Rainbow/PUSH|Rainbow/PUSH Coalition]], [[Center for American Progress]], [[Media Matters for America]], [[National Council of La Raza]], the [[Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]], [[Amnesty International]], the now-defunct [[ACORN]],<ref>http://www.nrtw.org/files/nrtw/NEA%20ACORN%20Image.JPG</ref>  and [[Walkathon|AIDS Walk Washington]]. <ref name=autogenerated3 /> . 

The NEA is a leading member of the [[U.S. Global Leadership Coalition]], a Washington D.C.-based coalition of over 400 major companies and [[NGO]]s that advocates for a larger International Affairs Budget, which funds American diplomatic and development efforts abroad. <ref>[http://www.usglc.org/about/our-coalition U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, Global Trust members]</ref> . 

==Criticism==. 
Substantial criticism has been leveled against the NEA and other teachers unions for allegedly putting the interests of teachers ahead of students and for consistently opposing changes that critics claim would help students but harm union interests. <ref name="hoover1"/>  The NEA has often opposed measures such as [[merit pay]], [[school vouchers]], weakening of teacher [[tenure]], certain curricular changes, the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], and many accountability reforms.  In a 1999 interview, conservative commentator [[Pat Buchanan]] said that "ever since the judges have gotten heavily into education, and the National Education Association has gotten into control of that [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]], test scores go down, there’s violence in classroom, things are going wrong". [[David Frum]] has correlated the drop in student achievement since the 1960s with a simultaneous increase in teacher pay and recruitment of less-qualified teachers, beginning in the 1970s. <ref name="'70s 140">{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|coauthors= |year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0465041957|page= |pages= 140–141|url= }}</ref> Frum writes: "The inept and lazy gained a huge new increment of job security. Assignments would be distributed by seniority, rather than skill."<ref name="'70s 140"/> . 

[[Apple Inc.]] CEO, [[Steve Jobs]], has criticized the NEA and other teacher unions for its lack of support for voucher programs, merit pay, and the removal of bad teachers. On February 17, 2007 at an education reform conference in [[Texas]], Jobs said, "What kind of person could you get to run a small business if you told them that when they came in they couldn’t get rid of people that they thought weren’t any good?”<ref>[http://sayanythingblog.com/entry/apples_steve_jobs_education_wont_improve_until_bad_teachers_can_be_fired/ Apple’s Steve Jobs: Education Won’t Improve Until Bad Teachers Can Be Fired - Say Anything<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . 

With the recent scrutiny placed on [[teacher misconduct]], regarding specifically sexual abuse, the NEA has been criticized for its failure to crack down on abusive teachers.  From an AP investigation, former NEA President Reg Weaver commented,  "Students must be protected from sexual predators and abuse, and teachers must be protected from false accusations." He then refused to be interviewed. <ref name=autogenerated7>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2007-10-20-teachermisconduct_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Thousands of teachers cited for sex misconduct | date=October 20, 2007 | accessdate=May 19, 2010 | first1=Martha | last1=Irvine | first2=Robert | last2=Tanner}}</ref> The Associated Press reported that much of the resistance to report the problem comes from "where fellow teachers look away," and "School administrators make behind-the-scenes deals."<ref name=autogenerated7 /> . 

Also criticized is the NEA's alleged "goal of changing public opinion on homosexuality, starting with the youngest generation,"<ref>[http://headlines.agapepress.org/archive/12/182006b.asp News from Agape Press<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> according to a former chairman of the NEA Ex-Gay Educators Caucus. <ref>[http://www.nea-exgay.org/ NEA Ex-Gay Educators Caucus<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>http://www.365gay.com/Newscon06/07/070106teachers.htm</ref><ref>http://www.crisismagazine.com/february2005/desmond.htm</ref> Some critics believe the NEA promotes a [[homosexual agenda|gay rights agenda]], especially since the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] 2005 case ''[[Fields v. Palmdale School District]]''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} The court in that case ruled that parents' fundamental right to control the upbringing of their children "does not extend beyond the threshold of the school door," and that a public school has the right to provide its students with "whatever information it wishes to provide, sexual or otherwise."<ref>http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/966A73E8103317D888257170007C7F87/$file/0356499.pdf?openelement</ref> NEA states that it does not “encourage schools to teach students to become gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgendered (GLBT),” but the Association does believe that schools should be safe for all students and advocates that schools should raise awareness of homophobia and intervene when GLBT students are harassed."<ref name=autogenerated2 /> . 

NEA has come under fire for taking advantage of laws in some states that compel, under certain conditions, membership in the association. In a case brought before the U.S. Supreme Court (''[[Davenport v. Washington Education Association]]'') on behalf of 4,000 Washington State teachers who are not NEA members but are nonetheless forced to pay NEA dues, the Court partially addressed the issue of collection and use of dues by unions such as the NEA. <ref>http://www.nrtw.org/b/nr_648.php</ref> . 

The leading critic of NEA from the left is Dr Rich Gibson, whose article on the NEA-AFT merger convention in Cultural Logic outlines a critique of unionism itself. <ref>[http://clogic.eserver.org/2-1/gibson.html Gibson: "NEA-AFT-AFL-CIO?..."<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . 

==Controversy==. 
Florida affiliate, FEA, has seen a number of scandals. In March 2001, a secretary in the [[Port Charlotte, Florida]] embezzled $66,000. In October of the same year, long-time Broward Teachers Union president Tony Gentile was arrested on child pornography charges. The local union paid him a [[golden parachute]] valued at $140,000.  In February 2003, $40,000 was embezzled from the [[St. Lucie County, Florida|St. Lucie County]] Classroom Teachers Association. And in April 2003, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and Miami police raided the headquarters of the United Teachers of Dade after receiving a tip that president Pat Tornillo had embezzled or misspent millions of dollars in union dues. Critics charge that the scandals are symbolic of deeper organizational biases and problems within NEA .Tornillo was eventually convicted, forced to sell most of his homes, and reimburse his local union. He served a two year prison term. The financial problems stemming from his actions nearly bankrupted UTD. <ref>Bell, "Union Chief Faces Battle," ''Ft.

The NEA was criticized in August 2002 for the appearance of a lesson plan on the website, originally reported by the Washington Times, that encouraged teachers to remove all references to Muslim terrorists in lesson plans for [[September 11th Attacks]]. One of the lesson plans, compiled together under the title "Remember September 11" and appearing on NEA's Health Information Network Website (www.neahin.org)-- suggested that teachers discuss "historical instances of American intolerance" and cites the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II as an example. <ref name="Sorokin2002">{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1571/is_35_18/ai_92352724/ | work=Insight on the News | title=NEA blames America for 9/11; critics say National Education Association lesson plans on Sept. 11 are anti-American and anti-Western civilization | first=Ellen | last=Sorokin | year=2002}}</ref>  The [[American Federation of Teachers]] spokesperson commented on the plan saying, "[The AFT] disagrees with the lesson plans found on the NEA Website. The AFT does not support a blame-America approach in particular and wishes to distance itself from the entire document." <ref name="Sorokin2002" />  Critics cited the controversy as an example of a political agenda and indoctrination by the NEA until it was ultimately removed from the website. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,60807,00.html | work=Fox News | title=NEA 9/11 Lesson Plan Draws Critics | date=August 20, 2002}}</ref> . 

On October 1, 2008 the [[Virginia]] NEA affiliate president Kitty Boitnott was caught emailing teachers encouraging them to dress up on "Obama Blue Day" and "to sway John McCain supporters."<ref>http://www.veanea.org/press-room/images/nr-email-2008-10-02.pdf</ref>  Residents criticized the move saying, "They should teach students how to think, not what to think."<ref name="washingtontimes.com">http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/oct/02/teachers-union-e-mail-touting-obama-draws-backlash/</ref> while Virginian Republicans criticized the attempt to sway students of voting age saying, "[schools] are a completely inappropriate place for teachers or education staff to be politicking on behalf of any candidate.
