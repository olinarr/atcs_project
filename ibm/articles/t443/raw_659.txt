A '''Sudbury school''' is a school that practices a form of [[democratic education]] in which students individually decide what to do with their time, and learn as a by-product of ordinary experience rather than adopting a descriptive educational [[syllabus]] or standardized instruction by classes following a prescriptive [[curriculum]]. Students have complete responsibility for their own education and the school is run by [[direct democracy]] in which students and staff are equals. <ref name=Ellis>{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Arthur K.|title=Exemplars of curriculum theory|publisher=Eye on Education|year=2004|isbn=1930556705}}</ref> . 

The name 'Sudbury' refers to [[Sudbury Valley School]], founded in 1968 in [[Framingham, Massachusetts]], the first school of this type. There are now more than 30 [[List of Sudbury schools|Sudbury-type schools]] around the world. <ref>The Sudbury Valley School web page, [http://www.sudval.org/07_othe_01.html]. </ref> These schools are not formally associated in any way, but are a loosely connected network that are mutually supportive of each other, operating as independent entities. <ref name=Ellis/>  See [[Sudbury Valley School#Educational philosophy|Sudbury Valley School Educational Philosophy]].  . 

The model differs in some ways from other types of democratic schools and [[anarchistic free school]]s, but there are many similarities:
* '''De-emphasis of [[class (education)|class]]es:''' There is no curriculum or set of required courses. Instead learner interest guides things, with students studying what they want to study. <ref name=Ellis/> There are generally no classrooms, just rooms where people choose to congregate. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Peramas|first=Mary|title=The Sudbury School and Influences of Psychoanalytic Theory on Student-Controlled Education|journal=Essays in Education|volume=19|pages=119(15)|date=Winter 2007}}</ref>
* '''Age mixing:''' students are not separated into age-groups of any kind and are allowed to mix freely, interacting with those younger and older than themselves; free age-mixing is emphasized as a powerful tool for learning and development in all ages. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psichi.org/Pubs/Articles/Article_645.aspx |title=Nature's Powerful Tutors; The Educative Functions of Free Play |accessdate=2009-07-25 |publisher=The National Honor Society in Psychology |last=Gray |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Gray (psychologist)}}</ref>
* '''Autonomous democracy:''' parents have limited involvement or no involvement in the school administration; Sudbury schools are run by a democratic school meeting where the students and staff participate exclusively and equally. Such meetings are also the sole authority on hiring and firing of staff, unlike most other schools. <ref>{{cite book|title= Promises Kept|last= Gross|first= Steven J.|year= 2004|publisher=[[Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development]]|location= United States|isbn= 087120973X|page= 140 }}</ref> . 

Sudbury schools are based on the belief that no kind of curriculum is necessary to prepare a young person for adult life. Instead, these schools emphasize learning as a natural by-product of all human activity. <ref name="Holzman">{{cite book|title= Schools for Growth: Radical Alternatives To Current Education Models|last= Holzman|first= Lois|authorlink= Lois Holzman|year= 1997|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location= United Kingdom|isbn= 0805823573|pages= 97–99}}</ref> . 

==School democracy==. 
All aspects of governing a Sudbury School are determined by the weekly School Meeting, modeled after the traditional [[New England]] [[town meeting]]. <ref>{{cite news|title=Students revel in free-for-all|date=1992-04-19|work=Telegram & Gazette|location=Worcester, Massachusetts}}</ref> School Meeting passes, amends and repeals school rules, manages the school's budget, and decides on hiring and firing of staff. Each individual present — whether student or staff — has exactly one vote, and most decisions are made by simple majority,<ref name=Ellis/> with the vote of a child counting as much as an adult. <ref>{{cite news|title=In Woodstock, a nonschool with nonteachers.(Hudson Valley Sudbury School, Woodstock, New York)|last=Rowe|first=Claudia|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2002-02-20}}</ref> . 

School rules are normally compiled in a law book, updated repeatedly over time, which forms the school's [[code (law)|code of law]]. Usually, there is a set procedure to handle complaints, and most of the schools follow guidelines that respect the idea of [[due process]] of law. There are usually rules requiring an investigation, a [[hearing (law)|hearing]], a [[trial (law)|trial]], a [[sentence (law)|sentence]], and allowing for an [[appeal]],<ref>{{Cite web|last=Feldman|first=Jay|title=The Moral Behavior of Children and Adolescents at a Democratic School|series=Paper presented at 82nd [[American Educational Research Association]] Meeting|location=[[Seattle]]|year=2001|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/23/12/00.pdf}}</ref> generally following the philosophy that students face the consequences of their own behavior. <ref>{{cite book|title=A Nation of Wimps: The High Cost of Invasive Parenting|last=Marano|first=Hara Estroff|year=2008|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=0767924037|page=237}}</ref> . 

==Learning==. 
Sudbury schools are based on the belief that no kind of curriculum is necessary to prepare a young person for adult life. Instead, these schools place emphasis on learning as a natural by-product of all human activity. <ref name="Holzman"/>  Learning is self-initiated and self-motivated. <ref>{{cite web|title=Self-governed, Sudbury Valley School begins in Massachusetts in History of Education: Selected Moments of the 20th Century|url=http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/research/edu20/moments/1968sudbury.html|first=Daniel|last=Schugurensky|work=[[Ontario Institute for Studies in Education]], [[University of Toronto]]|year=2003|accessdate=2009-08-31}}</ref>
They rely on the free exchange of ideas and free conversation and interplay between people, to provide sufficient exposure to any area that may prove relevant and interesting to the individual. Students of all ages mix; older students learn from younger students as well as vice versa. Students of different ages often mentor each other in social skills. The pervasiveness of play has led to a recurring observation by first-time visitors to a Sudbury school that the students appear to be in perpetual "[[recess (break)|recess]]". <ref name="Holzman"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/200809/why-we-should-stop-segregating-children-age-part-i-the-value-play-in-the-z|title=Why We Should Stop Segregating Children by Age: Part I--The Value of Play in the Zone of Proximal Development |date=2008-09-09|accessdate=2009-10-25 |last=Gray |first=Peter |publisher=Psychology Today |author=Peter Gray |authorlink=Peter Gray (psychologist)}}. </ref><ref>[[James Paul Gee|Gee, James Paul]] (2003).

Implicitly and explicitly, students are given responsibility for their own education, meaning the only person designing what a student will learn is the student him- or herself or by the way of [[apprenticeship]]. As such, Sudbury schools do not compare or rank students — the system has no tests, evaluations, or transcripts.  .
