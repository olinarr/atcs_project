'''Compulsory education''' refers to a period of education that is required of every person.  . 

==History==. 
===Antiquity to Medieval Era===. 
Although [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' is credited with having popularized the concept of compulsory education in Western intellectual thought, every parent in Judea since ancient times [[Jewish education#History|was required]] to teach their children at least informally. Over the centuries, as cities, towns and villages developed, a class of teachers called Rabbis evolved. According to the [[Talmud]] (tractate [[Bava Bathra]] 21a), which praises the sage [[Joshua ben Gamla]] with the institution of formal Jewish education in the 1st century AD.,  Ben Gamla instituted schools in every town and made formal education compulsory from the age of 6 or 7. <ref>Wikipedia: [[Jewish_education#Primary_schooling]]</ref> . 

The [[Aztec]]s (AD 1325-1521) had one of the first compulsory educational systems. All male children were required to attend school until the age of 16. <ref>Wikipedia: [[Aztec#Education]]</ref> . 

===Early Modern Era===. 
During the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 1524, [[Martin Luther]] advocated compulsory schooling so that all parishioners would be able to read the Bible themselves, and [[Strasbourg]]&mdash;then a free city of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]&mdash;passed accordant legislation in 1598.  . 

In [[Scotland]], the [[Reformation]] prompted the establishment of the first national compulsory system of education. The [[Education Act 1496|Education Act of 1496]] had obliged the children of noblemen and freeholders to attend school, but the [[School Establishment Act 1616|School Establishment Act of 1616]] commanded every parish with the means to establish a school paid for by parishioners. The [[Parliament of Scotland]] confirmed this with the [[Education Act 1633|Education Act of 1633]] and created a local land-based tax to provide the required funding. The required majority support of parishioners, however, provided a tax evasion loophole which heralded the [[Education Act 1646|Education Act of 1646]]. The turmoil of the age meant that in 1661 there was a temporary reversion to the less compulsory 1633 position. However, in 1696 a new [[Education Act 1696|Act]] re-established the compulsory provision of a school in every parish with a system of fines, sequestration and direct government implementation as a means of enforcement where required.  . 

In [[Education in Austria|Austria]], mandatory primary education was introduced by Empress [[Maria Theresa]] in 1774. <ref name="autogeneratedxiv">James van Horn Melton, 'Absolutism and the Eighteenth-Century Origins of Compulsory Schooling in Prussia and Austria', p.xiv</ref> . 

[[Prussia]] can claim the first modern compulsory system that was widely recognised and copied. It was introduced by decree of [[Frederick the Great]] in 1763-5<ref name="autogeneratedxiv"/> and was later expanded in the 19th century. This provided a working model for other states to copy; the clearest example of direct copying is probably [[Japan]] in the period of the [[Meiji Restoration]]. <ref>Wikipedia article [[Education in Japan]]</ref>
Prussia introduced this model of education so as to produce more obedient soldiers and serfs .  . 

===Modern Era===. 
Compulsory education on this model gradually spread to other countries, reaching the American [[Massachusetts|State of Massachusetts]] in 1852, and spreading to other states until, in 1917, [[Mississippi]] was the last state to enact a compulsory attendance law. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extremeintellect.com/ei2009/educationhistory/historyofeducation.html |title=History of Education. ExtremeIntellect.com |publisher=ExtremeIntellect.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-31}}</ref> [[Massachusetts]] had originally enacted the first compulsory education law in the American colonies in 1647{{contradict|date=November 2011}}. The [[Massachusetts General Court]] passed a law requiring every town to create and operate a grammar school. Fines were imposed on parents who did not send their children to school and the government took the power to take children away from their parents and apprentice them to others if government officials decided that the parents were "unfit to have the children educated properly". <ref name="rothbard1975">{{cite book

Compulsory education had not been part of early American society,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quaqua.org/history.htm |title=History. Quaqua Society |publisher=Quaqua.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-06}}</ref> which relied instead on private schools that mostly charged tuition. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quaqua.org/utah.htm |title=History of Alternative Education in the United States. Quaqua Society |publisher=Quaqua.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-06}}</ref> The spread of compulsory education in the Massachusetts tradition throughout America, especially for Native Americans, has been credited to General Richard Henry Pratt. <ref name="Witte-Mero">{{cite web|url=http://www.sutherlandinstitute.org/uploads/lawreview2008witte.pdf |title=Witte, Daniel E. and [[Paul Mero|Mero, Paul T.]] Removing Classrooms from the Battlefield: Liberty, Paternalism, and the Redemptive Promise of Educational Choice, 2008 BYU Law Review 377 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-10-06}}</ref> Pratt used techniques developed on Native Americans in a prisoner of war camp in Fort Marion, Augustine, Florida, to force demographic minorities across America into government schools. <ref name="Witte-Mero" /> His prototype was the Carlisle School in Pennsylvania.  . 

One of the last areas in Europe to adopt a compulsory system was [[England and Wales]], where the [[Elementary Education Act 1870]] paved the way by establishing [[school boards]] to set up schools in any places that did not have adequate provision. Attendance was made compulsory until age 10 in 1880.  . 

==Current status by country==. 
Some kind of education is compulsory to all people in most countries, but different localities vary in how many years or grades of education they require. Due to population growth and the proliferation of compulsory education, [[UNESCO]] has calculated that in the next 30 years more people will receive formal education than in all of human history thus far. <ref name="Robinson, K.">[http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html ''Schools Kill Creativity'']. TED Talks, 2006, Monterey, CA, USA. </ref> It is usually possible in many countries for parents to provide the required education for their children by some other means, such as [[homeschooling]], although this is typically monitored for adherence to national standards.  . 

===Australia===. 
Education is compulsory between the ages of 5 to 17 in every state and territory in Australia. However, this ruling may be waived if the student has decided to pursue full time employment or full-time education at other such institution (e.g. TAFE- Technical And Further Education).  . 

===Canada===. 
Education is compulsory between ages 6 to 16 in every province in [[Education in Canada|Canada]], except for [[Ontario]] and [[New Brunswick]], where the compulsory age is 18. In some provinces, early leaving exemptions can be granted under certain circumstances at 14.  .

===Mexico===. 
In [[Education in Mexico|Mexico]], schooling is required through lower secondary school only. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/offices/OUS/PES/int_mexico.html |title='&#39;Education around the World: Mexico.'&#39; US Department of Education (2003) |publisher=Ed.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-10-06}}</ref> . 

===Poland===. 
In Poland compulsory education ends at the age of 18. It usually starts when children are 6 years old and ends after 12 years of learning (usually in a high school). Contemporary Polish law distinguishes between compulsory school (''obowiązek szkolny'') and compulsory education (''obowiązek nauki'').  . 

First idea of compulsory education was put forward by [[Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski]] in 1555. After the [[partitions of Poland]], compulsory education was introduced by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] authorities in Polish provinces which belonged to Prussia (1825), and [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] authorities in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (1873). In the [[Russian Empire]] compulsory education did not exist. As a result, in 1921, after Poland regained independence, one-third of the population of the [[Second Polish Republic]] was illiterate. Illiteracy was very high in the east, and almost non-existent in western provinces. Compulsory education in Poland was introduced by a decree in February 1919. It covered all kids aged 7 to 14. At the beginning, however, newly created Polish state faced several problems in this field - lack of qualified teachers, lack of buildings and funds. After [[World War Two]], compulsory education remained as one of priorities of the state. In 1978, only 1,2% of Polish population was illiterate.  . 

===Russia===. 
The project of the Compulsory Primary Education Act was discussed in the [[Russian Empire]] from 1910, however in June 1912 it was rejected. <ref name=zaVO>{{cite web | url=http://www.hrono.ru/libris/stolypin/stpn1_80.html | title=О введении всеобщего начального обучения в Российской империи | language=russian | accessdate=2011-06-21}}</ref> In the first years of the [[Soviet Russia]] a massive [[Likbez]] campaign of eradication of illiteracy began, and later the primary education became compulsory. The [[1936 Soviet Constitution]] declared the free education among the other social and economic rights of the citizen.  . 

Eleven-year secondary education in Russian is compulsory since September 1, 2007. <ref name=194-FZ>{{cite web | url=http://www.rg.ru/2007/07/25/obrazovanie-izmenenia-dok.html | title=Federal law of 21 July 2007 No. 194-FZ | language=Russian | accessdate=2008-10-06 | publisher=Rossiyskaya gazeta (official publication)}}</ref> Until 2007, it was limited to nine years with grades 10-11 optional; [[federal subjects of Russia]] could enforce higher compulsory standard through local legislation within the eleven–year federal program. [[Moscow]] enacted compulsory eleven–year education in 2005,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.educom.ru/ru/documents/moscow.php | title=Moscow City law on secondary education in Moscow | language=Russian | accessdate=2008-10-06 | publisher=Moscow city administration, department of education }}</ref> similar legislation existed in [[Altai Krai]], [[Sakha Republic|Sakha]] and [[Tyumen Oblast]]. A student of 15 to 18 years of age ''may'' drop out of school with approval of his/her parent and local authorities,<ref>Federal law of Russia "On education", article 19.6</ref> and without their consent upon reaching age of 18. <ref>Federal law of Russia "On education", article 19.4</ref> Expulsion from school for multiple violations disrupting school life is possible starting at the age of 15. <ref>Federal law of Russia "On education", article 19.7</ref> . 

===Slovenia===. 
Compulsory education in [[Slovenia]] begins at the age of five and extends until the age of fourteen. After having attended [[primary school]] for nine years, pupils customarily continue to pursue some kind of secondary education ([[vocational school]]s, [[technical school]]s or [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]]).  . 

===Singapore===. 
In Singapore, the Compulsory Education Act (Cap 51) was passed by parliament on 9 October 2000 and was assented to the President on 16 October 2000. The statute provides for compulsory primary education for students in Singapore. In accordance to the Act, a child is of an age of compulsory education is one who is above the age of 6 years and has not reach the age of 15 years. A child of compulsory school age born after 1 January 1996, and who is a Singapore citizen residing in Singapore must attend a national primary school regularly with the exception of the child being exempted from compulsory education, e.g. a child with special needs and a child receiving home-schooling.   . 

Under the Compulsory Education Act (Cap 51), a child who fails to attend regularly as a student of a national primary school or a designated school/be home-schooled (where exemption is granted), the parents or guardian may be guilty of an offence under the Act. The penalties provided in the Act for a person to be convicted for the offence are a fine not exceeding S$5,000, or imprisonment  for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both. <ref>{{cite web|title=Compulsory Education in Singapore|url=http://www.moe.gov.sg/initiatives/compulsory-education/|publisher=Ministry of Education, Singapore|accessdate=2 February 2012}}</ref> . 

=== Taiwan (Republic of China) ===. 
{{Main|:zh:台灣九年國民義務教育#法令研訂}}
Compulsory education was extended from six years to nine years in 1968 in the [[Republic of China]], effective in [[Taiwan]] (both [[Taipei City]] and  [[Taiwan Province]] (which then covered [[Kaohsiung City]])), [[Kinmen County]] and [[Lienchiang County]]. 10th to 12th grade is projected to be free and guaranteed (but not compulsory) in 2013.  . 

===United Kingdom===. 
{{main|History of education in England}}
The [[Elementary Education Act 1870]], also known as ''[[William Edward Forster|Forster's]] Education Act''<ref>[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Leducation70.htm 1870 Education Act]</ref> created the concept of compulsory education for children under thirteen. Ten years after the [[Elementary Education Act 1880]] insisted on compulsory attendance from 5–10 years.  . 

Now in the [[United Kingdom]] compulsory education begins between four and a half and five and a half; since 1972 it has ended at the age of 16. But from 2013 compulsory education, be it traditional classroom education or training is planned to be raised to the age of 17, and from 2015 to the age of 18. <ref>http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/education-leaving-age</ref> . 

===United States===. 
{{main|History of education in the United States}}
Education is compulsory for most but not all children in the United States, but the age range for which school attendance is required varies from state to state. It begins between the ages of five and eight and ends between age sixteen and eighteen. <ref name="US_States">[http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d08/tables/dt08_165.asp Age range for compulsory school attendance and special education services, and policies on year-round schools and kindergarten programs.]. Retrieved November 28, 2009. </ref> Some states allow students to leave school between 14&ndash;17 with parental permission, before finishing high school; other states require students to stay in school until age 18. Many states do however allow gifted and talented students to accelerate their education so as to finish all educational requirements early.  . 

The State of New Hampshire voted into law HB 542 the repealing of compulsory curriculum in public schools. Governor Lynch initially issued a veto but it was overriden by both the New Hampshire House and Senate.  .
