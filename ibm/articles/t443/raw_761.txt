'''Higher''', '''post-secondary''', '''tertiary''', or '''third level education''' refers to the stage of [[learning]] that occurs at  [[University|universities]], [[Academy|academies]], [[college]]s, [[seminary|seminaries]], and [[institutes of technology]]. Higher [[education]] also includes certain collegiate-level institutions, such as [[vocational school]]s, trade schools, and career colleges, that award [[academic degree]]s or [[professional certification]]s.  . 

The right of access to higher education is enshrined in a number of [[international human rights instruments]]. The [[United Nations|UN]] [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] of 1966 declares, in Article 13, that "higher education shall be made equally accessible to all, on the basis of capacity, by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education". In [[Europe]], Article 2 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights|First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights]], adopted in 1950, obligates all signatory parties to guarantee the [[right to education]].  . 

==Overview==. 
Higher education is an educational level that follows the completion of a school providing a [[secondary education]], such as a [[high school]], [[secondary school]], or [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. Tertiary education is normally taken to include [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate education]], as well as [[vocational education]] and training. [[College]]s, [[university|universities]], and [[Institute of technology|institutes of technology]] are the main institutions that provide tertiary education (sometimes known collectively as tertiary institutions). Examples of institutions that provide post-secondary education are [[vocational school]]s, [[community college]]s, independent colleges (e.g. institutes of technology), and [[university|universities]] in the [[United States]], the institutes of [[technical and further education]] in [[Australia]], [[CEGEP]]s in [[Quebec]], and the [[IEK]]s in [[Greece]]. They are sometimes known collectively as tertiary institutions. Completion of tertiary education generally results in the awarding of [[Academic certificate|certificate]]s, [[diploma]]s, or [[academic degree]]s.  .

Higher education includes teaching, research, exacting applied work (e.g. in [[medical school]]s and [[dental school]]s), and social services activities of universities. Within the realm of teaching, it includes both the ''[[undergraduate education|undergraduate]]'' level, and beyond that, ''[[Postgraduate education|graduate-level]]'' (or ''postgraduate'' level). The latter level of education is often referred to as [[graduate school]], especially in North America.  . 

In the [[United Kingdom]] and certain other countries (e.g. Ireland), post-secondary school education below the level of higher education is referred to as "[[further education]]". "Higher Education" in the UK generally involves work towards a college-degree-level or [[foundation degree]] education.  . 

[[National Vocational Qualification|NVQ]] at level 4 (graduate level) and NVQ at level 5 (post graduate) are deemed "Higher Education".{{cn|this seems to disagree with previous sentence. This is inconsistent not only within UK but with the usual description in other English speaking countries|date=December 2011}} . 

In many developed countries, a high proportion of the population (up to 50%), now enter higher education at some time in their lives. Higher education is therefore very important to national [[economy|economies]], both as a significant industry in its own right and as a source of trained and educated personnel for the rest of the economy.  . 

There are two types of higher education in the U.K.: higher academic education, and higher [[vocational education]]. Higher education in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] specifically refers to post-secondary institutions that offer [[Associate's degree]]s, [[Bachelor's degree]]s, [[Master's degree]]s, [[Education Specialist]] (Ed.S.) degrees or [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) degrees, or their equivalents, and also higher professional degrees in areas such as law, medicine, optometry, dentistry,etc.  . 

Such institutions may also offer non-degree certificates, which indicate completion of a set of courses comprising some body of knowledge, but the granting of such certificates is not the primary purpose of the institutions. [[Tertiary education]] is not a term used in reference to post-secondary institutions in the United States or Canada.  . 

==Types==. 
===General===. 
The general higher education and training that takes place in a [[university]], [[college]], or Institute of Technology usually includes significant [[theory|theoretical]] and abstract elements, as well as applied aspects (although limited offerings of [[Internship|internships]] or [[Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF)|SURF]] programs attempt to provide practical applications). In contrast, the vocational higher education and training that takes place at [[vocational university|vocational universities and schools]] usually concentrates on [[practice (learning method)|practical applications]], with very little theory.  . 

In addition, [[professional]]-level education is always included within Higher Education, and usually in [[graduate school]]s, since many [[postgraduate education|postgraduate]] [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] are both vocationally, professionally, and theoretically/research oriented, such as in the [[law]], [[medicine]], [[pharmacy]], [[dentistry]], and [[veterinary medicine]]. A basic requirement for entry into these graduate-level programs is almost always a bachelor's degree.  Requirements for admission to such high-level graduate programs is extremely competitive, and admitted students are expected to perform well.  . 

===Liberal arts===. 
{{Main|Liberal arts college}} . 

Academic areas that are included within the [[Liberal arts]] include:
* [[Great Books]]
* [[History]]
* [[Language]]s including English
* [[Linguistics]]
* [[Literature]]
* [[Mathematics]]
* [[Music education|Music]]
* [[Philosophy]]
* [[Political Science]]
* [[Psychology]]
* [[Religious studies]]
* [[Science]]
* [[Sociology]]
* [[Drama school|Theater]] . 

====Performing arts====. 
{{Main|Performing arts education}} . 

The [[performing arts]] differ from the [[plastic arts]] or [[visual arts]], insofar as the former uses the artist's own body, face and presence as a medium; the latter uses materials such as clay, metal or paint, which can be molded or transformed to create a [[work of art]].  . 

Higher educational institutions include:
* [[:Category:Circus schools|Circus schools]]
* [[Dance studio|Dance school]]
* [[Drama school]]
* [[Music education]]
* [[Music school]] . 

====Plastic or visual arts====. 
{{Main|Art education|Art school}} . 

The [[plastic arts]] or [[visual arts]] are a class of [[Art#Art forms|art forms]], that involve the use of materials, that can be moulded or modulated in some way, often in three dimensions. Examples are [[painting]], [[sculpture]], and [[drawing]], etc.  . 

Higher educational institutions in these arts are:
* [[Film school]]s
* [[List of art schools]]
* [[List of art schools in Europe]]
* [[List of international architecture schools]] . 

===Vocational===. 
{{Main|Vocational university|Vocational school|Technical school}} . 

Higher vocational education and training takes place at the non-university tertiary level. Such education combines teaching of both practical skills and theoretical expertise. Higher education differs from other forms of post-secondary education such as that offered by institutions of [[vocational education]], which are more colloquially known as [[vocational school|trade school]]s. Higher vocational education might be contrasted with education in a usually broader [[science|scientific]] field, which might concentrate on [[theory]] and abstract [[concept]]ual knowledge.  . 

===Professional education===. 
*[[Architecture|Graduate College of Architecture]]
*[[Business school|Graduate College of Business]]
*[[Journalism school|Graduate College of Journalism]]
*[[Law school|Graduate College of the Law]]
*[[Library school|Graduate College of Library Science]]
*[[Optometry|Graduate College of Optometry]]
*[[Pharmacy school|Graduate College of Pharmacy]]

*[[Medical school|Human Medicine]]
*[[Engineering education|Professional Engineering]]
*[[Podiatric medical school|Podiatric Medicine]]
*[[Professional certification]]
*[[Dental school|Scientific Dentistry]]
*[[Veterinary school|Veterinary Medicine]] . 

==Recognition of studies==. 
The [[Lisbon Recognition Convention]] stipulates that degrees and periods of study must be recognised in all Signatory Parties of the Convention.  . 

==As employers==. 
Universities may employ a number of people. Depending on the funding, a university typically hires one teacher per 3-20 students. According to the ideal of research-university, the university teaching staff is actively involved in the research of the institution. In addition, the university usually also has dedicated research staff and a considerable support staff. Typically to work in higher education as a member of the academic [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]], a candidate must first obtain a doctorate in an academic field, although some lower teaching positions require only master's degree. {{cn|date=November 2011}} . 

Most of the administrative staff works in different administrative sections, such as [[Student Affairs]].{{cn|This appears "top of the head." Really needs citation and more university "sections"|date=November 2011}} In addition, there may be central support units, such as a university [[library]] which have a dedicated staff.{{cn|date=November 2011}} . 

The professional field involving the collection, analysis, and reporting of higher education data is called [[institutional research]]. Professionals in this field can be found, in addition to universities, in e.g. state educational departments.{{cn|date=November 2011}} .
