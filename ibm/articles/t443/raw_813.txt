{{Disability}}
'''Learning disability''' ('''LD''', sometimes called a '''learning difference,''' '''learning disorder,'''<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/100008806|learning disorders}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> or '''learning difficulty''') is a classification including several disorders in which a person has difficulty learning in a typical manner, usually caused by an unknown factor or factors. The unknown factor is the disorder that affects the [[Human brain|brain]]'s ability to receive and process information. This disorder can make it problematic for a person to learn as quickly or in the same way as someone who is not affected by a learning disability. People with a learning disability have trouble performing specific types of skills or completing tasks if left to figure things out by themselves or if taught in conventional ways.  . 

Some forms of learning disability are incurable.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} However, with appropriate cognitive/academic interventions, many can be overcome.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Individuals with learning disabilities can face unique challenges that are often pervasive throughout the lifespan. Depending on the type and severity of the disability, interventions may be used to help the individual learn strategies that will foster future success. Some interventions can be quite simplistic, while others are intricate and complex. Teachers and parents will be a part of the intervention in terms of how they aid the individual in successfully completing different tasks. School psychologists quite often help to design the intervention, and coordinate the execution of the intervention with teachers and parents. Social support improves the learning for students with learning disabilities.  . 

==Definitions==. 
{{Expand section|date=November 2009}}
In the 1980s, the National Joint Committee on Learning Disabilities (NJCLD){{Where|date=July 2011}} defines the term learning disability as: <blockquote>a heterogeneous group of disorders manifested by significant difficulties in the acquisition and use of listening, speaking, reading, writing, reasoning or mathematical abilities. These disorders are intrinsic to the individual and presumed to be due to Central Nervous System Dysfunction. Even though a learning disability may occur concomitantly with other handicapping conditions (e.g. sensory impairment, mental retardation, social and emotional disturbance) or environmental influences (e.g. cultural differences, insufficient/inappropriate instruction, [[psychogenic]] factors) it is not the direct result of those conditions or influences. </blockquote>  The NJCLD used the term to indicate a discrepancy between a child’s apparent capacity to learn and his or her level of achievement. <ref>1981; 1985</ref> . 

The 2002 LD Roundtable produced the following definition:
: "Concept of LD: Strong converging evidence supports the validity of the concept of specific learning disabilities (SLD). This evidence is particularly impressive because it converges across different indicators and methodologies. The central concept of SLD involves disorders of learning and cognition that are intrinsic to the individual. SLD are specific in the sense that these disorders each significantly affect a relatively narrow range of academic and performance outcomes. SLD may occur in combination with other disabling conditions, but they are not due primarily to other conditions, such as mental retardation, behavioral disturbance, lack of opportunities to learn, or primary sensory deficits."<ref name="BradleyDanielson2002">{{cite book|author1=Renée Bradley|author2=Louis C.

The term "learning disability" does not exist in [[DSM-IV]], but it has been proposed that it be added to [[DSM-5]], and incorporate the conditions learning disorder not otherwise specified and [[disorder of written expression]]. <ref name="urlProposed Revision | APA DSM-5">{{cite web |url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=429# |title=Proposed Revision &#124; APA DSM-5 |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref> . 

==Types of learning disabilities==. 
Learning disabilities can be categorized either by the type of information processing that is affected or by the specific difficulties caused by a processing deficit.  . 

===By stage of information processing===. 
Learning disabilities fall into broad categories based on the four stages of information processing used in learning: input, integration, storage, and output. <ref>National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities (NICHY),  2004. [http://www.nichcy.org/pubs/factshe/fs17txt.htm]. Accessed May 11, 2007. </ref>
* Input: This is the information perceived through the senses, such as visual and auditory perception. Difficulties with visual perception can cause problems with recognizing the shape, position and size of items seen.  There can be problems with [[Sequence learning|sequencing]], which can relate to deficits with processing time intervals or temporal perception.  Difficulties with auditory perception can make it difficult to screen out competing sounds in order to focus on one of them, such as the sound of the teacher's voice. Some children appear to be unable to process tactile input. For example, they may seem insensitive to pain or dislike being touched. 
* Integration: This is the stage during which perceived input is interpreted, categorized, placed in a sequence, or related to previous learning. Students with problems in these areas may be unable to tell a story in the correct sequence, unable to memorize sequences of information such as the days of the week, able to understand a new concept but be unable to generalize it to other areas of learning, or able to learn facts but be unable to put the facts together to see the "big picture."  A poor vocabulary may contribute to problems with comprehension. 
* Storage: Problems with memory can occur with short-term or working memory, or with long-term memory. Most memory difficulties occur in the area of short-term memory, which can make it difficult to learn new material without many more repetitions than is usual.  Difficulties with visual memory can impede learning to spell. 
* Output: Information comes out of the brain either through words, that is, language output, or through muscle activity, such as gesturing, writing or drawing. Difficulties with language output can create problems with spoken language, for example, answering a question on demand, in which one must retrieve information from storage, organize our thoughts, and put the thoughts into words before we speak. It can also cause trouble with written language for the same reasons. Difficulties with motor abilities can cause problems with gross and fine motor skills. People with gross motor difficulties may be clumsy, that is, they may be prone to stumbling, falling, or bumping into things. They may also have trouble running, climbing, or learning to ride a bicycle. People with fine motor difficulties may have trouble buttoning shirts, tying shoelaces, or with handwriting.  . 

===By function impaired===. 
Deficits in any area of information processing can manifest in a variety of specific learning disabilities. It is possible for an individual to have more than one of these difficulties. This is referred to as comorbidity or co-occurrence of learning disabilities. <ref name="titleAmanda Kirby speaking to dysTalk on The Co-occurrence of learning difficulties">{{cite web |url=http://www.dystalk.com/talks/57-co-occurrence-of-learning-difficulties |title=Amanda Kirby speaking on the co-occurrence of learning difficulties |publisher=dysTalk |accessdate=2009-04-22 |format= |work=}}</ref> In the UK, the term ''[[dual diagnosis]]'' is often used to refer to co-occurrence of learning difficulties.  . 

====Reading disorder  (ICD-10 and DSM-IV codes: F81.0/315.00)====. 
The most common learning disability. Of all students with specific learning disabilities, 70%-80% have deficits in reading. The term "[[dyslexia|Developmental Dyslexia]]" is often used as a synonym for reading disability; however, many researchers assert that there are different types of reading disabilities, of which dyslexia is one. A reading disability can affect any part of the reading process, including difficulty with accurate or fluent word recognition, or both, word decoding, reading rate, prosody (oral reading with expression), and reading comprehension. Before the term "dyslexia" came to prominence, this learning disability used to be known as "word blindness." . 

Common indicators of reading disability include difficulty with phonemic awareness—the ability to break up words into their component sounds, and difficulty with matching letter combinations to specific sounds (sound-symbol correspondence).  . 

====Disorder of Written Expression (ICD-10 and DSM-IV-TR codes 315.2)====. 
Speech and language disorders can also be called [[Dysphasia]]/[[Aphasia]] (coded F80.0-F80.2/315.31 in ICD-10 and DSM-IV).  . 

The DSM-IV-TR criteria for a '''Disorder of Written Expression''' is writing skills (as measured by standardized test or functional assessment) that fall substantially below those expected based on the individual's chronological age, measured intelligence, and age appropriate education, (Criterion A). This difficulty must also cause significant impairment to academic achievement and tasks that require composition of written text (Criterion B), and if a sensory deficit is present, the difficulties with writing skills must exceed those typically associated with the sensory deficit, (Criterion C)<ref>American Psychiatric Association. (2000). Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text revision). Washington, DC: Author. </ref>.  . 

Individuals with a diagnosis of a Disorder of Written Expression typically have a combination of difficulties in their abilities with written expression as evidenced by grammatical and punctuation errors within sentences, poor paragraph organization, multiple spelling errors, and excessively poor handwriting. A disorder in spelling or handwriting without other difficulties of written expression do not generally qualify for this diagnosis. If poor handwriting is due to an impairment in motor coordination, a diagnosis of [[Developmental Dyspraxia]] should be considered.  . 

The term "[[dysgraphia]]" has been used as an overarching term for all disorders of written expression. Others, such as the International Dyslexia Association, use the term "dysgraphia" to refer to difficulties with handwriting.  . 

====Math disability (ICD-10 and DSM-IV codes F81.2-3/315.1)====. 
Sometimes called [[dyscalculia]], a math disability can cause such difficulties as learning math concepts (such as quantity, place value, and time), difficulty memorizing math facts, difficulty organizing numbers, and understanding how problems are organized on the page. Dyscalculics are often referred to as having poor "number sense". <ref name="titleDyscalculia expert Jane Emerson explains number sense and its relevance to dyscalculia">{{cite web |url=http://www.dystalk.com/talks/32-what-is-dyscalculia |title=Dyscalculia expert Jane Emerson explains number sense and its relevance to dyscalculia|publisher=dystalk.com |accessdate=2009-04-23 |format= |work=}}</ref> . 

====Non ICD-10/DSM====. 
* [[Nonverbal learning disability]]: Nonverbal learning disabilities often manifest in motor clumsiness, poor visual-spatial skills, problematic social relationships, difficulty with math, and poor organizational skills.  These individuals often have specific strengths in the verbal domains, including early speech, large vocabulary, early reading and spelling skills, excellent rote-memory and auditory retention, and eloquent self-expression. <ref>{{cite book |author=Lerner, Janet W. |title=Learning disabilities: theories, diagnosis, and teaching strategies |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0395961149 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>
* Disorders of speaking and listening: Difficulties that often co-occur with learning disabilities include difficulty with memory, social skills and executive functions (such as organizational skills and time management).  . 

==Diagnosis==. 
===IQ-Achievement Discrepancy===. 
Learning disabilities are often identified by [[psychiatrist]]s, [[school psychologist]]s, [[clinical psychologist]]s, and [[neuropsychologist]]s through a combination of [[intelligence test]]ing, academic achievement testing, classroom performance, and social interaction and aptitude.  Other areas of assessment may include perception, cognition, memory, attention, and language abilities.  The resulting information is used to determine whether a child's academic performance is commensurate with his or her cognitive ability. If a child's cognitive ability is much higher than his or her academic performance, the student is often diagnosed with a learning disability. The DSM-IV and many school systems and government programs diagnose learning disabilities in this way (DSM-IV uses the term "disorder" rather than "disability".) . 

Although the discrepancy model has dominated the school system for many years, there has been substantial criticism of this approach among researchers. <ref name=Aaron1995>{{cite journal | author = Aaron, P.G. | year = 1995 | title = Differential Diagnosis of Reading Disabilities | journal = School Psychology Review | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 345–60 | issn = 0279-6015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Patti L. Harrison; Flanagan, Dawn P. |title=Contemporary intellectual assessment: theories, tests, and issues |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=1-59385-125-1 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>  Recent research has provided little evidence that a discrepancy between formally measured IQ and achievement is a clear indicator of LD. <ref name =Fletcher>{{cite book |author=Marcia A. Barnes; Fletcher, Jack; Fuchs, Lynn |title=Learning Disabilities: From Identification to Intervention |publisher=The Guilford Press |location=New York |year= 2007|pages= |isbn=1-59385-370-X |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>  Furthermore, diagnosing on the basis of a discrepancy does not predict the effectiveness of treatment. Low academic achievers who do not have a discrepancy with IQ (i.e. their IQ scores are also low) appear to benefit from treatment just as much as low academic achievers who do have a discrepancy with IQ (i.e. their IQ scores are higher than their academic performance would suggest).  . 

===Response to Intervention (RTI)===. 
Much current research has focused on a treatment-oriented diagnostic process known as [[response to intervention]] (RTI).  Researcher recommendations for implementing such a model include early screening for all students, placing those students who are having difficulty into research-based early intervention programs, rather than waiting until they meet diagnostic criteria. Their performance can be closely monitored to determine whether increasingly intense intervention results in adequate progress. <ref name =Fletcher/> Those who respond will not require further intervention. Those who do not respond adequately to regular classroom instruction (often called "Tier 1 instruction") and a more intensive intervention (often called "Tier 2" intervention) are considered "nonresponders." These students can then be referred for further assistance through special education, in which case they are often identified with a learning disability. Some models of RTI include a third tier of intervention before a child is identified as having a learning disability.  . 

A primary benefit of such a model is that it would not be necessary to wait for a child to be sufficiently far behind to qualify for assistance. <ref>{{Cite journal | last = Finn | first = C.E.,  Rotherham  A.J. & Hokanson C.R. | year = 2001 | title = Rethinking Special Education For A New Century | publisher = Progressive Policy Institute | url= http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=110&subsecID=900030&contentID=3344 | postscript = <!--None--> }}</ref> This may enable more children to receive assistance before experiencing significant failure, which may in turn result in fewer children who need intensive and expensive special education services. In the United States, the 2004 reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act permitted states and school districts to use RTI as a method of identifying students with learning disabilities. RTI is now the primary means of identification of learning disabilities in Florida.  . 

The process does not take into account children's individual neuropsychological factors such as phonological awareness and memory, that can help design instruction. <ref>Fletcher-Janzen, Reynolds. (2008). Neuropsychological Perspectives on Learning Disabilities in the Era of RTI: Recommendations for Diagnosis and Intervention</ref>  Second, RTI by design takes considerably longer than established techniques, often many months to find an appropriate tier of intervention. Third, it requires a strong intervention program before students can be identified with a learning disability. Lastly, RTI is considered a regular education initiative and is not driven by psychologists, reading specialists, or special educators.  . 

===Assessment===. 
Many normed assessments can be used in evaluating skills in the primary academic domains: reading, including word recognition, fluency, and comprehension; mathematics, including computation and problem solving; and written expression, including handwriting, spelling and composition.  . 

The most commonly used comprehensive achievement tests include the Woodcock-Johnson III (WJ III), Weschler Individual Achievement Test II (WIAT II), the Wide Range Achievement Test III (WRAT III), and the Stanford Achievement Test–10th edition.  These tests include measures of many academic domains that are reliable in identifying areas of difficulty. <ref name = Fletcher/> . 

In the reading domain, there are also specialized tests that can be used to obtain details about specific reading deficits. Assessments that measure multiple domains of reading include Gray's Diagnostic Reading Tests–2nd edition (GDRT II) and the Stanford Diagnostic Reading Assessment. Assessments that measure reading subskills include the Gray Oral Reading Test IV&nbsp;– Fourth Edition (GORT IV), Gray Silent Reading Test, Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP), Tests of Oral Reading and Comprehension Skills (TORCS), Test of Reading Comprehension 3 (TORC-3), Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE), and the Test of Reading Fluency.  A more comprehensive list of reading assessments may be obtained from the [http://www.sedl.org/reading/rad/chart.html Southwest Educational Development Laboratory]. <ref>Southwest Educational Development Laboratory (SEDL), 2007.[http://www.sedl.org/reading/rad/chart.html Southwest Educational Development Laboratory] Accessed September 15, 2007. </ref> . 

The purpose of assessment is to determine what is needed for intervention, which also requires consideration of contextual variables and whether there are comorbid disorders that must also be identified and treated, such as behavioural issues or language delays. <ref name = Fletcher/> .

Sternberg<ref>Sternberg, R. J., & Grigorenko, E. L. (1999). Our labeled children: What every parent and teacher needs to know about learning disabilities. Reading, MA: Perseus Publishing Group</ref> has argued that early remediation can greatly reduce the number of children meeting diagnostic criteria for learning disabilities. He has also suggested that the focus on learning disabilities and the provision of accommodations in school fails to acknowledge that people have a range of strengths and weaknesses, and places undue emphasis on academic success by insisting that people should receive additional support in this arena but not in music or sports. Other research has pinpointed the use of resource rooms as an important—yet often politicized component of educating students with learning disabilities. <ref>''Journal of Learning Disabilities'', Dec 1973; vol. 6: pp. 609 - 614</ref> . 

==Causes and risk factors==. 
{{No footnotes|section|date=November 2009}}
The causes for learning disabilities are not well understood, and sometimes there is no apparent cause for a learning disability. However, some causes of neurological impairments include:
* Heredity&nbsp;– Learning disabilities often run in the family. 
* Problems during pregnancy and birth&nbsp;– Learning disabilities can result from anomalies in the developing brain, illness or injury, fetal exposure to alcohol or drugs, low birth weight, oxygen deprivation, or by premature or  prolonged labor. 
* Accidents after birth&nbsp;– Learning disabilities can also be caused by head injuries, malnutrition, or by toxic exposure (such as heavy metals or pesticides).  . 

==Impact on affected individuals==. 
{{Expand section|date=November 2009}}
Neuropsychological differences can impact the accurate perception of social cues with peers. <ref>Rourke, B. P. (1989). Nonverbal learning disabilities: The syndrome and the model. New York: Guilford Press. </ref>
A diagnosis of a learning disability can be potentially devastating to an individual and their family. Both the individual and their family will need to learn methods of coping with the effects of the disorder; they will also need to learn how to cope with the disorder emotionally. Stress related to the disorder can accumulate, making the coping process difficult. Stigmas that friends/family/peers have about the learning disorder can also contribute to the stress level the individual feels. Learning disabilities are often present throughout the lifespan, so learning appropriate and effective methods of coping are essential to successful management of the disorder.  . 

==Social Correlates of Learning Disabilities==. 
===Learning Disability as a Social Construction===. 
Learning disability theory is founded in a medical model, in that disability is perceived as an individual deficit that is biological in origin. <ref>Gallego, Margaret A., Grace Zamora Durán, and Elba I.

Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. </ref> In the bigger picture, these points demonstrate how the label of disability is socially constructed and represents a lack of fit between Western conceptions of educational institutions and proper students.  . 

===Disproportionality in the U.S.===. 
One of the most clear indications of the social roots of learning disabilities is the disproportionate identification of racial and ethnic minorities and students who have low [[socioeconomic status]] (SES). While some attribute the disproportionate identification of racial/ethnic minorities to racist practices or cultural misunderstanding,<ref>Patton, James M. 1998. "The Disproportionate Representation of African Americans in Special Education: Looking Behind the Curtain for Understanding and Solutions." The Journal of Special Education 32(1):25-31. </ref><ref>Reid, D. Kim and Michelle G. Knight. 2006. "Disability Justifies Exclusion of Minority Students: A Critical History Grounded in Disability Studies." Educational Researcher 35(6):18-23. </ref> others have argued that racial/ethnic minorities are overidentified because of their lower average SES. <ref>MacMillan, Donald L. and Daniel J. Reschly. 1998. "Overrepresentation of Minority Students: The Case for Greater Specificity or Reconsideration of the Variables Examined." The Journal of Special Education 32(1):15-24</ref><ref>Skiba, Russell J., Ada B. Simmons, Shana  Ritter, Ashley C. Gibb, M. Karega Rausch, Jason Cuadrado, and Choong-Geun Chung. 2008. "Achieving Equity in Special Education: History, Status, and Current Challenges." Exceptional Children 74(3):264-288. </ref> Similarities were noted between the behaviors of “brain-injured” and lower class students as early as the 1960s. <ref name="CarrierJames" /> The distinction between race/ethnicity and SES is important to the extent that these considerations contribute to the provision of services to children in need. 
While many studies have considered only one characteristic of the student at a time,<ref>Haveman, Robert, Gary Sandefur, Barbara Wolfe, and Andrea Voyer. 2004. "Trends in Children's Attainment and Their Determinants as Family Income Inequality Has Increased." in Social Inequality, edited by K. M. Neckerman. New York: Russell Sage Foundation. </ref> or used district- or school-level data to examine this issue, more recent studies have used large national student-level datasets and sophisticated methodology to find that the disproportionate identification of African American students with learning disabilities can be attributed to their average lower SES, while the disproportionate identification of Latino youth seems to be attributable to difficulties in distinguishing between linguistic proficiency and learning ability. <ref name="Shifrer1">{{cite web |url=http://www.prc.utexas.edu/etag/23rd%20Floor%20Publications/Shifrer,%20Dara/Shifrer%20et%20al.%202010-Disproportionality.pdf|title=Shifrer, Dara, Chandra Muller, and Rebecca Callahan. 2010.

"Disproportionality and Learning Disabilities: Parsing Apart Race, Socioeconomic Status, and Language." Journal of Learning Disabilities 44(3):246-257|work= |accessdate=2011-06-17}}</ref> Although the contributing factors are complicated and interrelated, it is possible to discern which factors really drive disproportionate identification by considering a multitude of student characteristics simultaneously. For instance, if high SES minorities have rates of identification that are similar to the rates among high SES whites, and low SES minorities have rates of identification that are similar to the rates among low SES whites, we can know that the seemingly higher rates of identification among minorities result from their greater likelihood to have low SES. Summarily, because the risk of identification for white students who have low SES is similar to that of black students who have low SES, future research and policy reform should focus on identifying the shared qualities or experiences of low SES youth that lead to their disproportionate identification, rather than focusing exclusively on racial/ethnic minorities. <ref name="Shifrer1" /><ref name="Shifrer2" /> It remains to be determined why lower SES youth are at higher risk of incidence, or possibly just of identification, with learning disabilities.  . 

==Contrast with other conditions==. 
People with an [[IQ]] lower than 70 are usually characterized as having [[mentally retarded|mental retardation]] (MR), [[Mentally deficient|mental deficiency]], or cognitive impairment and are not included under most definitions of learning disabilities, because their learning difficulties are considered to be related directly to their low IQ scores.  . 

[[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) is often studied in connection with learning disabilities, but it is not actually included in the standard definitions of learning disabilities.  An individual with ADHD may struggle with learning, but he or she can often learn adequately once successfully treated for the ADHD.  A person can have ADHD but not learning disabilities or have learning disabilities without having ADHD. The conditions can co-occur.  . 

Some research is beginning to make a case for ADHD being included in the definition of LDs, since it is being shown to have a strong impact on "executive functions" required for learning. This has not as yet affected any official definitions.  . 

==Advocacy of the concept of learning disabilities==. 
[[Rick Lavoie]] is an advocate, author, special education teacher, and writer of learning disabilities.  He started a school in Massachusetts specifically targeted towards learning disabled children.  Rick Lavoie has written several books on the subject of learning disabilities and their impact on children.  [[The F.A.T. City Project]] (1989) was a documentary that created a mock environment where everyday people could experience the Frustration, Anxiety, and Tension of being a learning disabled child.

==United States and Canada==. 
In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], the terms '''learning disability''' and '''learning disorder''' (LD) refer to a group of disorders that affect a broad range of academic and functional skills including the ability to [[Speech communication|speak]], [[hearing (sense)|listen]], [[Reading (process)|read]], [[writing|write]], [[spelling|spell]], [[reason]], organize [[information]], and do [[math]]. A person's [[IQ]] must be [[average]] or above to have a learning disability or learning disorder.  . 

===USA Legislation related to learning difficulties===. 
The [[Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act|'''Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act 1973''']] was taken in effect in May 1977, this American legislation guarantees certain rights to people with disabilities, especially in the cases of education and work, such being in schools, colleges and university settings.  . 

The '''[[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]]''', formerly known as the [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]], is a [[United States federal law]] that governs how states and public agencies provide early intervention, [[special education]] and related services to children with disabilities. It addresses the educational needs of children with disabilities from birth to the age of 21. <ref>20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq. </ref>  Considered as a civil rights law, states are not required to participate.  . 

==United Kingdom==. 
In the [[UK]], terms such as [[specific learning difficulty]] (SpLD), [[dyslexia|Developmental Dyslexia]], [[dyspraxia]] and [[dyscalculia]] are used to cover the range of learning difficulties referred to in the United States as "learning disabilities". In the UK, the term "learning disability" refers to a range of developmental disabilities or conditions that are almost invariably associated with more severe generalized [[mental retardation|cognitive impairment]].  .
