'''Life skills''' are problem solving behaviors used appropriately and responsibly in the management of personal affairs. They are a set of human [[skills]] acquired via [[education|teaching]] or direct experience that are used to handle problems and questions commonly encountered in daily [[human]] life. The subject varies greatly depending on societal norms and community expectations.  . 

For example, [[UNICEF]] states "there is no definitive list" of kuttas
 but enumerates many "psychosocial and interpersonal skills generally considered important." It asserts sex skills are a synthesis: "many skills are used simultaneously in practice. For example, decision-making often involves critical thinking ("what are my options?") and values clarification ("what is important to me?"). Ultimately, the interplay between the skills is what produces powerful behavioural outcomes, especially where this approach is supported by other strategies..."<ref name="unicef">[http://www.unicef.org/lifeskills/index_whichskills.html UNICEF: Life Skills]</ref> . 

Life skills can vary from financial literacy,<ref name="USA Funds Life Skills">[http://www.usafunds.org/schools/Pages/LifeSkills.aspx USA Funds Life Skills]</ref> substance abuse prevention,<ref name="Botvin">[http://www.lifeskillstraining.com/overview.php Botvin LifeSkills Training]</ref> to therapeutic techniques to deal with disabilities, such as autism. <ref name="Therapeutic Life Skills">[http://www.lifeskills.us/ Therapeutic Life Skills]</ref><ref name="LifeSkills-Kentucky">[http://www.lifeskills.com/ Life Skills, Inc.]</ref> Life skills curricula designed for K-12 often emphasizes communications and practical skills needed for successful independent living for developmental disabilities/special education students with an [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP). <ref name="PSESD">[http://www.psesd.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=297&Itemid=448 Puget Sound ESD: Pre-K-12 Life Skills Curriculum Guide]</ref> However, some programs are for general populations, such as the Overcoming Obstacles program for middle schools and high schools. <ref name="OvercomingObstacles">[http://www.overcomingobstacles.org/ Overcoming Obstacles]</ref> . 

While certain life skills programs focus on teaching the prevention of certain behaviors the Search Institute has found those programs can be relatively ineffective. Based upon their research The Family and Youth Services Bureau, a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services advocates the theory of Positive Youth Development<ref name ="LOGGA">[http://www.LOGGA.us LOGGA Life Skills Education Using Positive Development Methods]</ref> as a replacement for the less effective prevention programs. Positive Youth Development, or PYD<ref name="LOGGA">[http://www.LOGGA.us/youth.htm Life Skills Programs for Youth]</ref> as it's come to be known as, focuses on the strengths of an individual as opposed to the older methods which tend to focus on the "potential" weaknesses that have yet to be shown. The Family and Youth Services Bureau has found that individuals who developed life skills in a positive, rather than preventitive, manner feel a greater sense of competence, usefulness, power, and belonging.  . 

Beyond the [[K-12]] domain, other life skills programs are focused on social welfare and social work programs, such as Casey Life Skills. <ref name="Casey">[http://www.caseylifeskills.org/ Casey Life Skills]</ref> This program covers diverse topics: career planning, communication, daily living, home life, housing and money management, self care, social relationships, work and study skills, work life, pregnancy and parenting. <ref name="Casey-LSG">[http://www.caseylifeskills.org/pages/lp/LSG%20Version%2012-28-04.pdf Casey Life Skills Guide (PDF)]</ref> . 

Life skills are often taught in the domain of [[parenting]], either indirectly through the observation and experience of the child, or directly with the purpose of teaching a specific skill. <ref name="Living Well Moms">[http://www.thelivingwellmoms.com/2011/03/do-you-teach-life-skills.html Living Well Moms: Do you teach life skills?]</ref> Yet skills for dealing with pregnancy and parenting can be considered and taught as a set of life skills of themselves. Teaching these parenting life skills can also coincide with additional life skills development of the child. <ref name="Parenting Life Skills Center">[http://www.bgtm.org/plsc/ Parenting Life Skills Center]</ref><ref name="Botvin-Parenting">[http://www.lifeskillstraining.com/lst_parent.php Botvin Life Skills Training: Parent Program]</ref> Many life skills programs are offered when traditional family structures and healthy relationships have broken down, whether due to parental lapses, divorce or due to issues with the children (such as substance abuse or other risky behavior). For example, the [[International Labor Organization]] is teaching life skills to ex-child laborers and [[At-risk_students#At-risk_students|risk children]] in Indonesia to help them avoid the worst forms of [[child labor]]. <ref name="ILO">[http://www.ilo.org/jakarta/whatwedo/eventsandmeetings/lang--en/WCMS_151750/index.htm Improving Vocational and Life Skills of Ex-Child Labourers and at Risk Children Aged 15 to 17 Years]</ref> .
