A '''voting age''' is a [[minimum age]] established by law that a person must attain to be eligible to vote in a public election.  . 

The vast majority of countries in the world have established a voting age.  Most governments consider that those of any age lower than the chosen threshold lack the necessary capacity to independently decide how to cast a vote.  The voting age is often of such importance that it is set by means of a constitutional provision.  . 

At the present time the voting age across the world is typically 18.  When the [[suffrage|right to vote]] was first accorded in [[democracy|democracies]] the voting age was generally set at 21, or in some cases at an even higher level.  In the 1970s widespread reform led to a reduction to 18 in a large number of countries.  Debate is currently underway in many places on proposals to reduce the voting age below 18. In May 2009, Danish Member of Parliament Mogens Jensen presented an initiative to the [[Parliamentary Assembly]] of the [[Council of Europe]] in [[Strasbourg]] to lower the voting age in Europe to 16. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc09/EDOC11895.pdf |title=edoc11895 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-01-06}}</ref> There has also been discussion of giving votes to children from birth, initially with the votes being cast by parents, who are presumed to better understand a child's interests ([[Demeny voting]]).  .

==History== . 

In the nineteenth century almost all countries had voting ages of 21 or higher. Two notable exceptions were the Orange Free State, where it was 18, and the South African Republic where it was 16. Czechoslovakia was early to act, reducing its age to 18 in 1946, and by 1968 a total of 17 states had made the reduction. <ref name="Maryland">[http://www.djs.state.md.us/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000138/html/am138--51.html ''"Lowering the Minimum Voting Age to 85½  Years - Pro and Con Arguments"''], Constitutional Revision Study Documents of the [[Maryland]] Constitutional Convention Commission, 1968.  Retrieved on 5 February 2007. </ref>  A large number of countries, particularly in Western Europe, reduced their voting ages to 18 during the 1970s, starting with the United Kingdom in 1970 with countries such as the US ([[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|26th Amendment]]), Canada, Australia and France following soon afterwards. By the end of the 20th century, 18 had become by far the most common age at which citizens acquired the right to vote. However, a few countries maintained voting ages of 20 years or higher.  . 

Consideration of a reduction to 18 continued into the late 20th and early 21st century in those countries that had not already made the change. Reductions were seen in India, Switzerland, Austria and [[Morocco]] during this time. Since 2007, debate has been taking place in Japan,<ref>{{cite news

===Further reductions===. 
[[File:NYRA Berkeley voting age protest.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Protest in favour of lowering the voting age by members of [[National Youth Rights Association|NYRA]] [[Berkeley, California]], 2004.]]Around the turn of the 21st century a number of countries began to consider whether the voting age ought to be reduced further, with arguments most often being made in favour of a reduction to 16.  The earliest moves came during the 1990s, when the voting age for [[municipal]] elections in some states of [[States of Germany]] was lowered to 16. [[Lower Saxony]] was the first state to make such a reduction, in 1995, and four other states later copied the move. <ref name="16 locals"/> . 

In the 2000s a number of legislative proposals for reductions of the voting age to 16 were made in various U.S. states, including [[California]], [[Florida]] and [[Alaska]],<ref>[http://youthrights.org/votestatus.php Worldwide Efforts to Lower the Voting Age], National Youth Rights Association</ref> but ultimately none were successful.  Proposals were made in 2005 for a national reduction in Canada<ref>[[Parliament of Canada]], Bill C-261 (2005); [http://vote16.ca/en/index.htm Vote16, Canada]</ref> and a state reduction in [[New South Wales]], Australia,<ref>[[Parliament of New South Wales]], Parliamentary Electorates and Elections Amendment (Voting Age) Bill (2005); [[Hansard]], 14 September 2005, [http://parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansArt.nsf/V3Key/LC20050914041 p. 17686]. </ref> but again there was no success.  . 

====Austria====. 
In 2007 Austria became the first member of the [[European Union]] to adopt a voting age of 16 for most purposes. <ref name="Austria 4"/> The voting age had been reduced in [[Austria]] from 19 to 18 at all levels in 1992.  At that time a voting age of 16 was proposed by the [[The Greens – The Green Alternative|Green Party]], but was not adopted. <ref name="NR pass"/> . 

The voting age for municipal elections in some [[States of Austria|states]] was lowered to 16 in the early 2000s. <ref name="16 locals">[http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/files/dms/AEM_10002-8073__E__N__S__W__.pdf ''How old is old enough?'' - the minimum age of voting and candidacy in UK elections: consultation paper], July 2003, UK [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]], para. 3.6. </ref>  Three states had made the reduction by 2003 ([[Burgenland]], [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] and [[Styria]]),<ref name="16 locals"/> and in May 2003 [[Vienna]] became the fourth. <ref>[http://www.votesat16.org.uk/news/000030.html ''Austria joins the votes at 16 club''], [[Votes at 16]].

Following the [[Austrian legislative election, 2006|legislative election in 2006]], the winning [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|SPÖ]]-[[Austrian People's Party|ÖVP]] coalition announced on 12 January 2007 that one of its policies would be the reduction of the voting age to 16 for elections in all states and at all levels in [[Austria]]. <ref name="Austria 1">{{cite news

====United Kingdom====. 
The reduction of the voting age to 16 in the United Kingdom was first given serious consideration on 15 December 1999, when the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] considered in Committee an amendment proposed by [[Simon Hughes]] to the ''Representation of the People Bill''. <ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmhansrd/vo991215/debtext/91215-steven smells14.htm#91215-14_time0 HC Deb, 15 Dec 1999, Vol. 341, cc. 305-338.] Retrieved on 3 November 2007. </ref>  This represented the first occasion that the question of a voting age lower than 18 had ever been put to a vote in the Commons. <ref name="Ibidat">Ibid, at c. 336. </ref> The Government opposed the amendment, and it was defeated by 434 votes to 36. <ref name="Ibidat" /> .

In 2004 the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] conducted a major consultation on the subject of the voting and [[Age of candidacy|candidacy]] ages, and received a significant response.  In its conclusions it recommended that the voting age remain at 18. <ref>[http://www.bibliotheque.assnat.qc.ca/01/mono/2005/10/826116.pdf ''Age of Electoral Majority''], Electoral Commission, 19 April 2004, para. 8.16</ref> On 29 November 2005 the House of Commons voted 136-128 (on a [[free vote]]) against a [[Private Member's Bill]] for a reduction in the voting age to 16 proposed by [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] MP [[Stephen Williams (politician)|Stephen Williams]].  [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] chose not to include a provision reducing the voting age in the [[Electoral Administration Act 2006|Electoral Administration Act]] during its passage in 2006.  .

====United States====. 
[[File:States17primary.png|thumb|left|Purple indicates a state that allows 17-year olds who will turn 18 on or before election day to vote in caucuses or primaries.]]
In the [[United States]], nineteen states permit 17-year-olds to vote in [[primary elections]] and caucuses if they will be 18 by election day. An amendment to the state constitution is being considered in the [[Illinois]] legislature that would lower its voting age to 17 for non-federal elections, though states can set their voting age to lower than 18 for federal elections as well. Because it only applies to state elections, 17-year-olds would not be able to vote in primaries and general elections for [[United States House of Representatives|representatives]], [[United States Senate|senators]], and [[President of the United States]] even if the amendment passes the legislature and referendum. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.deviantart.com/article/43380/ |title=News: Bill to lower voting age to 17 goes to House floor |publisher=News.deviantart.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-06}}</ref> . 

To pass, 60 percent of each house of the state legislature would have to approve it, and it would then have to be approved over half of by voters in the November general election. 
Currently, the Maine Green Independent Party, the state branch of the [[Green Party of the United States]], calls for the lowering of the voting age to 17. <ref>[http://www.mainegreens.org/index.php?sectionID=266&pageID=590&mode= Green Platform]</ref> [[Youth suffrage]] appears to be gaining ground in [[Massachusetts]]; three of the four Democratic United States Senate candidates in 2010 supported lowering the voting age. <ref>{{cite web|author=Name * |url=http://lowerthevote.wordpress.com/2009/11/30/three-massachusetts-senator-candidates-support-lower-voting-age |title=Three Massachusetts Senator Candidates Support Lower Voting Age " Lower The Voting Age |publisher=Lowerthevote.wordpress.com |date=2009-11-30 |accessdate=2011-01-06}}</ref> .

==Voting ages around the world==. 
18 is the most common voting age, with a small minority of countries differing from this rule.  Those with a national minimum age of 17 include [[East Timor]], [[Indonesia]], [[North Korea]], the [[Seychelles]] and [[Sudan]].  The minimum age is 16 in Austria, Brazil, Cuba, Nicaragua and the [[Isle of Man]], though the Isle of Man is under British sovereignty.  People aged 16–18 can vote in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] if employed. The highest minimum voting age is 21 in several nations. Some countries have variable provision for the minimum voting age, whereby a lower age is set for eligibility to vote in state, regional or municipal elections.  . 

The only known maximum voting age is in the [[Holy See]], where the franchise for electing a new [[Pope]] is restricted to [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]] under the age of 80.  .
