A '''video game content rating system''' is a system used for the classification of [[video game]]s into suitability-related groups. Most of these systems are associated with and/or sponsored by a government, and are sometimes part of the local [[motion picture rating system]]. The utility of such ratings has been called into question by studies that publish findings such as 90% of teenagers claim that their parents "never" check the ratings before allowing them to rent or buy video games,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/23/4b/03.pdf|title=The Impact of Interactive Violence on Children: Testimony submitted to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, United States Senate|accessdate=2008-07-13|author=Dr. David Walsh|format=PDF|date=2000-03-21}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> and as such calls have been made to "fix" the existing rating systems. <ref>Jerry Bonner (April 2008). "How to Fix the Ratings System: A former game rater lists six ways to bolster the Entertainment Software Rating Board," ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' 227, 30-32. </ref> Video game content rating systems can be used as the basis for laws that cover the sales of video games to minors, such as in Australia. Rating checking and approval is part of the [[game localization]] when they are being prepared for their distribution in other countries or locales. 
These rating systems have also been used to voluntarily restrict sales of certain video games by stores, such as the German retailer [[Metro AG|Kaufhof]]'s removing all video games rated 18+ by the USK following the [[Winnenden school shooting]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/spielzeug/0,1518,614088,00.html|language=German|title=Kaufhof schafft Filme und Spiele f√ºr Erwachsene ab|date=18 March 2009|accessdate=18 March 2009|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]}}</ref> .

==History==. 
The upheaval struck on two fronts. First were the arcades, hit with the release of Mortal Kombat, a fighting game of unprecedented violence. With heightened realism provided by the use of digitized actors rather than hand-drawn characters, the game featured vicious combinations of fighting moves, Romero-worthy bloodletting and vocal exhortations to "finish" your enemy with special "fatalities." Possibly the most controversial fighting game ever released, Mortal Kombat's blend of over-the-top violence and thrilling fights proved irresistible to gamers, turning it into a tremendous success and laying the foundation for a franchise that continues to this day.  . 

Then came the home market later that same year, faced with a similar assault in the guise of the infamous Night Trap. With over an hour and a half of full-motion video and a production cost of $1.5 million, Night Trap told the story of a slumber party gone wrong and the young, nightgown-wearing houseguests who must be saved from horrible fates by the voyeuristic gamer. A commercial flop, the game's sexually exploitative setting and gameplay nonetheless made it a focal point of Congressional hearings on offensive videogame content.  . 

Led by U.S. Senators Joe Lieberman and Herb Kohl, a Congressional hearings on offensive video game content ran from late 1992 into 1993, and resulted in an ultimatum for the industry: Form a workable, self-regulated rating system for videogames within one year, or prepare for the U.S. federal government to implement one of its own. The threat of government regulation led to the formation of not just one but a handful of rating schemes from different corners of the industry.  . 

Sega of America led the charge with the short-lived [[Videogame Rating Council]]. Established in 1993, the system was intended to cover all U.S. releases of games for the Sega Genesis, Game Gear and Sega CD. The VRC featured three ratings: General Audiences, MA-13 (Parental Discretion Advised) and MA-17 (Not Appropriate For Minors). The system was simultaneously simplistic and confusing; the lack of rating detail, combined with Sega's failure to document or explain their meaning, often left consumers puzzled over the actual nature of the game's content.  . 

Also founded in 1993 was the 3DO Rating System, for games released in North America on the 3DO console. Similar to Sega's VRC, the 3DO Rating System was even narrower in focus - 3DO games only, which were scant in number - and featured four vague but easy-to-follow ratings: E (Everyone), 12 (Parental Guidance for 12 and Under), 17 (Parental Guidance for 17 and Under), and AO (Adults Only). In a significant improvement over Sega's VRC, details of the in-game content would be contained on the back of the box.  . 

But neither of these systems adequately addressed the demands of the U.S. Congress, and neither survived to see the close of 1994. They did, however, provide a template for a third and somewhat more successful attempt at a comprehensive rating system that would satisfy videogaming critics: The Software Publishers Association's Recreational Software Advisory Council (RSAC). The RSAC provided five levels of ratings in the categories of Violence, Nudity-Sex and Language. Despite the lack of an age-based rating, the system was more detailed than its predecessors while remaining comparatively simple to understand, and for awhile it saw reasonably widespread acceptance. Unfortunately, it suffered from one major, fatal flaw: The RSAC system was for PC software only, therefore inapplicable to console releases. This limitation, exacerbated by the 1995 debut of the explosively popular [[PlayStation]] console, rendered the RSAC system all but irrelevant, and in 1999 it quietly passed on.  . 

The big dog in the fight was the result of the April 1994 formation of the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA), a trade group assembled from the most powerful game developers and publishers in the country. In July 1994, the IDSA (renamed to the Entertainment Software Association in 2003) presented to Congress its proposal for an industry-controlled rating system; in September of that same year, the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB) was unveiled.  . 

Initially, the ESRB system included five ratings: Early Childhood, Kids to Adults, Teen, Mature and Adults Only. Over the years the system would mature and be refined to meet the needs of both a growing industry and an expanding gamer demographic. The rating stamps would change to become more visible, and in 1998 the Kids to Adults rating was replaced with an Everyone (E) rating. Content descriptors have been changed and added over the years, giving greater specificity to the ratings. Currently, the ESRB uses a two-tiered system with six age-based ratings, complemented by 32 content descriptors that offer detailed information about a game, including the presence of everything from crude humor to tobacco references and animated blood. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/the-needles/1300-Inappropriate-Content-A-Brief-History-of-Videogame-Ratings-and-the-ESRB|title=Inappropriate Content: A Brief History of Videogame Ratings and the ESRB}}</ref> . 

==Controversy==. 
Similar to other forms of media, ''[[video game]]s'' have been the subject of argument between leading professionals and restriction and prohibition. Often these bouts of criticism come from use of debated topics such as video game [[graphic violence]], virtual sex, violent and gory scenes, partial or full nudity, portrayal of [[crime|criminal behavior]] or other provocative and objectionable material.  . 

Video games have also been studied for links to [[video game addiction|addiction]] and [[aggression]]. Several studies have found that video games do not contribute to these problems. Further, several groups have argued that few if any scientifically proven studies exist to back up these claims, and that the video game industry has become an easy target for the media to blame for many modern day problems. <ref>"Video Violence: Villain or Victim?", Guy Cumberbatch, London Video Standards Council, 2004</ref><ref>"It's Not the Media", Karen Sternheimer, Westview, 2003</ref><ref>{{cite news|last = Benedetti|first=Winda|title=Why search our souls when video games make such an easy scapegoat?|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date = 2008-02-18|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23204875/|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref> Furthermore, numerous researchers have proposed potential positive effects of video games on aspects of social and cognitive development and psychological well-being. <ref>{{cite news|last=Radoff|first=Jon|title=Six Wonderful Things about Games|date=2009-12-08|url=http://radoff.com/blog/2009/12/08/six-wonderful-things-about-games/|accessdate=2009-12-19}}</ref> It has been shown that action video game players have better [[hand-eye coordination]] and visuo-motor skills, such as their resistance to distraction, their sensitivity to information in the peripheral vision and their ability to count briefly presented objects, than non-players. <ref>http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v423/n6939/full/nature01647.html</ref> .
