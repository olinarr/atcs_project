The '''video game industry''' (often referred to as '''[[interactive entertainment]]''') is the [[economics|economic]] sector involved with the [[Video game development|development]], [[marketing]] and sales of [[video game]]s. It encompasses dozens of job disciplines and employs thousands of people worldwide.  . 

== Overview == . 

Considered by some as a curiosity in the mid-1970s, the computer and video game industries have grown from focused markets to mainstream. They took in about [[United States dollar|US$]]9.5 billion in the US in 2007, 11.7 billion in 2008, and 25.1 billion in 2010 ([[Entertainment Software Association|ESA]] annual report).  . 

Modern [[personal computer]]s owe many advancements and innovations to the game industry:  [[sound card]]s, [[graphics card]]s and [[3D graphic accelerator]]s, [[CD ROM]] and [[DVD-ROM]] drives, are a few of the more notable improvements.  . 

[[Sound card]]s were developed for addition of digital-quality sound to games and only later improved for music and [[audiophile]]s. <ref name="sndhist">{{cite web | url=http://www.harmony-central.com/Computer/synth-history.html | publisher=Wired Ventures | work=Wired | author=Bob Johnstone | title=Wave of the Future : The story of the next generation in sound technology | accessdate=2009-04-01}}</ref> Early on graphics cards were developed for more colors.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Later, graphics cards were developed for [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs) and games. GUIs drove the need for high resolution,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} games drove 3D acceleration.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} They also are one of the only pieces of hardware to allow multiple hookups (such as with [[Scan Line Interleave|SLI]] or [[ATI CrossFire|CrossFire]] graphics cards).{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} CD- and DVD-ROMs were developed for mass distribution of media in general, however the ability to store more information on cheap easily distributable media was instrumental in driving their ever higher speeds.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} . 

Modern games are among the most demanding of applications on PC resources. Many of the high-powered [[IBM PC compatible|personal computers]] are purchased by [[gamer]]s who want the fastest equipment to power the latest cutting-edge games.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Thus, the inertia of CPU development is due in part to this industry whose games demand faster processors than business or personal [[software|applications]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} . 

== Game industry value chain == . 

Ben Sawyer of Digitalmill observes that the game industry [[value chain]] is made up of six connected and distinctive layers: . 

# Capital and publishing layer: involved in paying for development of new titles and seeking returns through licensing of the titles. 
# Product and talent layer: includes [[developer]]s, [[video game designer|designers]] and [[game artist|artists]], who may be working under individual contracts or as part of in-house development teams. 
# Production and tools layer: generates content [[game tool|production tools]], game development [[Game Middleware|middleware]], [[Game engine|customizable game engines]], and production management tools. 
# Distribution layer: or the "[[video game publisher|publishing]]" industry, involved in generating and marketing catalogs of games for retail and online distribution. 
# Hardware (or Virtual Machine or Software Platform) layer: or the providers of the underlying platform, which may be console-based, accessed through online media, or accessed through mobile devices such as the [[iPhone]]. This layer now includes non-hardware platforms such as virtual machines (e.g. Java or Flash), or software platforms such as browsers or even further Facebook, etc. 
# End-users layer: or the users/players of the games. <ref name="newmedia"> .

== Disciplines == . 

The game industry employs those experienced in other traditional businesses, but some have experience tailored to the game industry. For example, many [[recruiter]]s target just game industry professionals.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Some of the disciplines specific to the game industry include: [[game programmer]], [[game designer]], [[level designer]], [[game producer]], [[game artist]] and [[game tester]]. Most of these professionals are employed by [[video game developer]]s or [[video game publisher]]s. However, many [[hobby]]ists also produce computer games and sell them commercially.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Recently{{When|date=April 2011}} game developers have begun to employ those with extensive or long-term experience within the [[Mod (video gaming)|modding]] communities.  .

The video game industry began in 1971 with the release of the [[arcade game]], ''[[Computer Space]]''. The following year, [[Atari, Inc.]] released the first commercially successful video game, ''[[Pong]]'', the original arcade version of which sold over 19,000 [[Video game arcade cabinet|arcade cabinets]]. <ref>{{citation|title=Computer and Video Game Law: Cases and Materials|author=Ashley S.

Pong made its first appearance in 1972 at "Andy Capp's," a small bar in Sunnyvale, California, where the video game was literally "overplayed" as eager customers tried to cram quarters into an already heavily overloaded coin slot.}}</ref> That same year saw the introduction of video games to the home market with the release of the early [[video game console]], the [[Magnavox Odyssey]]. However, both the arcade and home markets would be dominated by ''Pong'' clones, which flooded the market and led to the [[video game crash of 1977]]. The crash eventually came to an end with the success of [[Taito Corporation|Taito]]'s ''[[Space Invaders]]'', released in 1978, sparking a renaissance for the video game industry and paving the way for the [[golden age of video arcade games]]. <ref name="Whittaker-122">{{citation|title=The cyberspace handbook|author=Jason Whittaker|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2004|isbn=041516835X|page=122}}</ref> The game's success inspired arcade machines to become prevalent in mainstream locations such as [[shopping mall]]s, traditional storefronts, [[restaurant]]s and [[convenience store]]s during the golden age. <ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.next-gen.biz/features/30-defining-moments-gaming| title = The 30 Defining Moments in Gaming| publisher = [[Future plc]]| work = [[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]| author= Edge Staff| date = 2007-08-13| accessdate = 2008-09-18}}</ref> ''Space Invaders'' would go on to sell over 360,000 [[Video game arcade cabinet|arcade cabinets]] worldwide,<ref>{{citation|title=Asia Pacific perspectives, Japan|volume=1|author=Jiji Gaho Sha, inc.|year=2003|publisher=[[University of Virginia]]|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CTRWAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=2011-04-09|page=57|quote=At that time, a game for use in entertainment arcades was considered a hit if it sold 1000 units; sales of Space Invaders topped 300,000 units in Japan and 60,000 units overseas.}}</ref> and by 1982, generate a revenue of $2&nbsp;billion in [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarters]],<ref name="CBC-1982">{{cite news|title=Making millions, 25 cents at a time|work=[[The Fifth Estate]]|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=November 23, 1982|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/arts_entertainment/media/clips/15869/|accessdate=2011-04-30}}</ref><ref name="Executive">{{citation|title=Space Invaders vs. Star Wars|work=Executive|volume=24|publisher=Southam Business Publications|year=1982|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-KwTAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=2011-04-30|page=9|quote=According to TEC, Atari's arcade game Space Invaders has taken in $2&nbsp;billion, with net recipts of $450 million.}}</ref> equivalent to $4.6 billion in 2011. <ref name="Inflation">{{cite web|title=CPI Inflation Calculator|publisher=[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]|url=http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm|accessdate=2011-03-22}}</ref> .

A recent Atari survey showed that 86 percent of the US population from 13 to 20 has played some kind of video game and an estimated 8 million US homes have video games hooked up to the television set.

The early part of the decade saw the rise of home computing, and [[Homebrew (video games)|home-made games]], especially in Europe (with the [[ZX Spectrum]]) and Asia (with the [[NEC PC-8801|NEC PC-88]] and [[MSX]]). This time also saw the rise of [[video game journalism]], which was later expanded to include [[covermount]]ed cassettes and CDs. 
In 1983, the [[North American video game crash of 1983|North American industry crashed]] due to the production of too many badly developed games (quantity over quality), resulting in the fall of the North American industry. The industry would eventually be revitalized by the release of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], which resulted in the home console market being dominated by Japanese companies such as [[Nintendo]],<ref name="newmedia" /> while a professional European computer game industry also began taking shape with companies such as [[Ocean Software]]. <ref>[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ystop100.html YS Top 100] from [[World of Spectrum]]</ref> The latter part of the decade saw the rise of the [[Game Boy]] handheld system. In 1987, Nintendo lost a legal challenge against [[Blockbuster Entertainment]], which enabled games rentals in the same way as movies.  .

{{see also|History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|History of video game consoles (sixth generation)}} . 

The 1990s saw advancements in game related technology. Among the significant advancements were:
* The widespread adoption of [[compact disc|CD]]-based storage and software distribution
* Widespread adoption of [[graphical user interface|GUI]]-based [[operating system]]s, such as the series of [[Amiga OS]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS]]
* Advancement in 3D graphics technology, as [[Graphics processing unit|3D graphic cards]] became widely adopted, with [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] now the ''[[de facto]]'' standard for video game visual presentation
* Continuing advancement of [[CPU]] speed and sophistication
* Miniaturisation of hardware, and mobile phones, which enabled [[mobile gaming]]
* The emergence of the internet, which in the latter part of the decade enabled online co-operative play and [[competitive gaming]] . 

Aside from technology, in the early part of the decade, [[brand licensing|licenced]] games became more popular,<ref>{{cite web|last=Fahs |first=Travis |url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/896/896893p1.html |title=IGN Presents the History of Madden - Retro Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.retro.ign.com |date=2008-08-08 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hurby |first=Patrick |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=100805/madden |title=ESPN - OTL: The Franchise - E-ticket |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}</ref> as did video game sequels. <ref>{{cite web|last=McLaughlin |first=Rus |url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/954/954426p2.html |title=IGN Presents the History of Street Fighter - Retro Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.retro.ign.com |date=2010-07-07 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}</ref> .

Today, the video game industry is a juggernaut of development; profit still drives technological advancement which is then used by other industry sectors. Though maturing, the video game industry is still very volatile, with third-party video game developers quickly cropping up, and just as quickly, going out of business.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. Nevertheless, many [[casual game]]s and [[indie game]]s have been developed and many have become popular and successful, such as ''[[Braid (video game)|Braid]]'', ''[[Limbo (video game)|Limbo]]'', or ''[[Minecraft]]''. Games are also made for mobile phones and social networking sites. For example, a [[Facebook]] game developer, [[Zynga]], has raised in excess of 300 million{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}. Another great example of mobile gaming would include the [[iPod touch]] , [[iPhone]] and the [[PlayStation Portable]]<ref>[http://techcrunch.com/2009/12/15/zynga-takes-180-million-venture-round-cue-russian-mafia-jokes/]</ref> . 

== Economics == . 

Early on, development costs were minimal, and video games could be quite profitable. Games developed by a single programmer, or by a small team of programmers and artists, could sell hundreds of thousands of copies each. Many of these games only took a few months to create, so developers could release several titles each year. Thus, publishers could often be generous with benefits, such as [[royalties]] on the games sold. Many early game publishers started from this economic climate, such as [[Origin Systems]], [[Sierra Entertainment]], [[Capcom]], [[Activision]] and [[Electronic Arts]].  . 

As computing and graphics power increased, so too did the size of development teams, as larger staffs were needed to address the ever increasing graphical and programming complexities. Now budgets can easily reach millions of dollars, even if [[Game Middleware|middleware]] and pre-built [[game engine]]s are used. Most professional games require one to three years to develop, further increasing the strain on budgets.  . 

Some developers are turning to alternative production and distribution methods, such as [[digital distribution|online distribution]], to reduce costs.  . 

Today, the video game industry has a major impact on the economy through the sales of major systems and games such as, ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'', which took in over [[United States dollar|USD]]$650 million of sales in the game's first five days, which set a five-day global record for a movie, book or videogame. <ref>[http://blog.games.yahoo.com/blog/278-call-of-duty-black-ops-sets-record-for-activision "Call of Duty: Black Ops" sets record for Activision"]''[[Yahoo Games Plugged In]]'', 2010-12-21.

Retrieved on 2008-04-15. </ref>  Many individuals have also benefited from the economic success of video games including the former chairman of [[Nintendo]] and Japan's third richest man: [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]]. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.forbes.com/2008/05/07/japan-wealth-technology-cz-km-japanrichest08_0507intro.html |title=Japan's Richest Man Is...Yes, Hiroshi Yamauchi |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ffEMvYUl |archivedate=2009-03-30|accessdate=2009-03-30|work=Forbes |date=2008-05-07}}</ref> . 

== Practices == . 

Video game industry practices are similar to those of other entertainment industries (e.g. the [[recording industry|music recording industry]]), but the video game industry in particular has been accused of treating its development talent poorly. This promotes independent development, as developers leave to form new companies and projects. In some notable cases, these new companies grow large and impersonal, having adopted the business practices of their forebears, and ultimately perpetuate the cycle.  . 

However, unlike the music industry, where modern technology has allowed a fully professional product to be created extremely inexpensively by an independent musician, modern games require increasing amounts of manpower and equipment. This dynamic makes [[video game publisher|publishers]], who fund the [[video game developer|developers]], much more important than in the music industry.  . 

=== Breakaways === . 

A particularly famous case is the "original" independent developer [[Activision]], founded by former [[Atari]] developers. Activision grew to become the world's second largest game publisher. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10224904/activision-aims-for-sweet-spot.html|title=Activision Aims for Sweet Spot|last=Wolverton|first=Troy|date=2005-05-24|publisher=TheStreet.com|accessdate=2009-03-30|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ffLSaAf0|archivedate=2009-03-30}}</ref> In the mean time, many of the original developers left to work on other projects. For example, founder [[Alan Miller (game designer)|Alan Miller]] left Activision to start another video game development company, [[Accolade (game company)|Accolade]] (now [[Atari]] née [[Infogrames]]).  . 

Activision was popular among developers for giving them credit in the packaging and title screens for their games, while Atari disallowed this practice. As the video game industry took off in the mid-1980s, many developers faced the more distressing problem of working with fly-by-night or unscrupulous publishers that would either fold unexpectedly or run off with the game profits.  . 

=== Economics === . 

{{main|Video gaming in the United States}} . 

In 2004, the U.S. game industry as a whole was worth [[United States dollar|USD]]$10.3 billion. <ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/may2006/id20060511_715050.htm?campaign_id=rss_innovate An Industry Shows Its Growing Value] from ''[[BusinessWeek]]''</ref>
However, economic problems remain today with regard to publisher-developer contracts (see [[Copyright assignment|copyright: transfer of rights]]).  . 

In June 2011, the global video game market was valued at US$65 billion. <ref>{{cite news|title=Factbox: A look at the $65 billion video games industry|date=6 June 2011|work=Reuters|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/06/06/us-videogames-factbox-idUKTRE75552I20110606|accessdate=17 July 2011}}</ref> .

The industry claims [[software piracy]] to be a big problem, and take measures to counter this. <ref>{{cite web|last=Valjalo |first=David |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/3ds-will-fight-piracy-firmware |title=3DS Will Fight Piracy With Firmware &#124; Edge Magazine |publisher=Next-gen.biz |date=2010-10-04 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}</ref> However, [[digital rights management]] and other measures have proved noticeably unpopular with gamers. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7972677.stm |title=Technology &#124; EA 'dumps DRM' for next Sims game |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-03-31 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}</ref> . 

=== Creative control === . 

Some gamers have shown disapproval of publishers having creative control on various internet forums since they are more apt to follow short-term market trends rather than invest in risky but potentially lucrative ideas. On the other hand, publishers may know better than developers what consumers want. The relationship between video game developers and publishers parallels the relationship between [[Recording Artists' Coalition|recording artists]] and [[RIAA|record labels]] in many ways. But unlike the [[music industry]], which has seen flat or declining sales in the early 2000s,<ref>[http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20021010.html Global sales of recorded music down 9.2% in the first half of 2002] from [[IFPI]]</ref><ref>[http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20031001.html Global sales of recorded music down 10.9% in the first half of 2003] from [[IFPI]]</ref><ref>[http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20051003.html Digital sales triple to 6% of industry retail revenues as global music market falls 1.9%] (2005) from [[IFPI]]</ref> the video game industry continues to grow. <ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2132172920070621 Video game industry growth still strong: study] from [[Reuters]]</ref> Also, personal computers have made the independent development of music almost effortless, while the gap between an independent game developer and the product of a fully financed one grows larger.  . 

In the [[computer game]]s industry, it is easier to create a startup, resulting in many successful companies. The [[video game console|console]] games industry is a more closed one, and a game developer must have up to three licenses from the [[console manufacturer]]: . 

# A license to develop games for the console
# The publisher must have a license to publish games for the console
# A separate license for each game . 

In addition, the developer must usually buy development systems from the console manufacturer in order to even develop a game for consideration, as well as obtain concept approval for the game from the console manufacturer. Therefore, the developer normally has to have a publishing deal in place before starting development on a game project, but in order to secure a publishing deal, the developer must have a track record of console development, something which few startups will have.  . 

=== Alternatives === . 

An alternative method for publishing video games is to self-publish using the [[shareware]] or [[open source]] model over the [[Internet]]. However, it remains to be seen whether freely made and distributed games can survive in the era of multi-million dollar production.  . 

=== Japanese video game industry practices === . 

{{main|Video gaming in Japan}} . 

The [[Japan]]ese video game industry is markedly different from the industry in [[North America]] and [[Europe]].  . 

Generally, games have a greater [[market share]] of total entertainment in Japan than in the West.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Japan has created some of the largest and most expensive titles ever made, such as the ''[[Shenmue]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', ''[[Metal Gear]]'' and ''[[Mario]]'' series of games.  . 

==== Arcades ====. 
[[Video arcade|Video game arcades]] are still relatively popular in Japan; for every [[arcade game]] released in the US, nine are released in Japan.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The history of the Japanese arcade is very significant in the story of the decline of the American arcade, and in the shape of [[game design]] in general.  . 

==== Media ==== . 

[[video game console|Consoles]] and arcade games are the main media for Japanese game design; [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] games are nowhere near as popular. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} This necessarily dictates that there are fewer independently developed games coming from Japan, as it is much harder to develop independently for a console than it is for a PC.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} . 

==== Development environment ==== . 

The structure and culture of a Japanese game developer is different from a western one. Throughout the history of Japanese game design, many developers have seen fit to remain mostly anonymous, even using pseudonyms to a large degree in video game credits.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} . 

Also, the division in labor for video game development is different. For example, Japanese game design teams had a dedicated [[game designer|designer]] (which they called a "director") much earlier than American design teams adopted the practice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
Secondly, Japanese game designers throughout history generally had far more people working on a particular game than a comparable western design team. For example, ''[[Street Fighter 2]]'' (1991), a Japanese title, had almost one artist working on every character in the game, plus two programmers and a musician, with the result being a team of twenty or more people.  ''[[Mortal Kombat (video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' (1992), a comparable American title, was developed by four people: a [[game programmer|programmer]], an [[artist]], a [[musician]], and a background artist.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} .

=== Video game industry in Canada === . 

{{main|Video gaming in Canada}} . 

Canada has the third largest video game industry in terms of employment numbers. <ref name="networkworld1">{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/040610-canada-boasts-the-third-largest-video.html |title=Canada boasts the third-largest video game industry |publisher=Networkworld.com |date=2010-04-06 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}</ref> The video game industry has also been booming in Montreal since 1997, coinciding with the opening of [[Ubisoft Montreal]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Recently, the city has attracted world leading game developers and publishers studios such as [[Ubisoft]], [[Electronic Arts|EA]], [[Eidos Interactive]], [[Artificial Mind and Movement]], [[Bioware]], and [[Strategy First]], mainly because video games jobs have been heavily subsidized by the provincial government. Every year, this industry generates billions of dollars and thousands of jobs in the Montreal area.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} [[Vancouver]] has also developed a particularly large [[business cluster|cluster]] of [[video game]] developers, the largest of which, [[Electronic Arts]], employs over two thousand people. The ''[[Assassins Creed]]'' series, along with the ''[[Tom Clancy]]'' series and more recently ''[[Rainbow Six]]'', have all been produced in Canada and have achieved worldwide success.  . 

=== UK video game industry practices === . 

{{main|Video gaming in the United Kingdom}} . 

The [[United Kingdom|UK]] industry is the third largest in the World in terms of developer success and sales of hardware and software by country alone but fourth behind Canada in terms of people employed. <ref name="networkworld1"/> In recent years some of the studios have become defunct or been purchased by larger companies such as ''[[LittleBigPlanet]]'' developer, [[Media Molecule]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/03/02/media-molecule-officially-joins-the-playstation-family/ |title=Media Molecule Officially Joins The PlayStation Family – PlayStation.Blog.Europe |publisher=Blog.eu.playstation.com |date=2010-03-02 |accessdate=2011-01-27}}</ref> and [[Codemasters]]. <ref>{{cite web|last=Hinkle |first=David |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/04/05/reliance-big-entertainment-acquires-50-stake-in-codemasters |title=Reliance Big Entertainment acquires 50% stake in Codemasters |publisher=Joystiq |date=2010-04-05 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}</ref> Though the country houses many of the world's most successful franchises such as ''[[Tomb Raider]]'', ''[[Grand Theft Auto (series)|Grand Theft Auto]]','[[Fable (video game series)|Fable]]'', ''[[Colin McRae: Dirt|Dirt]]'' and ''[[Total War (series)|Total War]]'', the country is trying to find its identity, with many of the games without any cultural influence coming from the UK, with most influence derived from [[North America]].{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} . 

The country also went without tax relief until the 21st March 2012<ref>{{cite web|last=Henderson |first=Rik |url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/44996/budget-2012-tax-relief-video-games |title=UK tax relief break |date=2012-3-21 |accessdate= 2012-3-31}}</ref> when the British government changed its mind on tax relief for UK developers, which without, meant most of the talented development within the UK may move overseas for more profit, along with parents of certain video game developers which would pay for having games developed in the UK. The industry trade body TIGA estimates that it will increase the games development sector’s contribution to UK GDP by £283 million, generate £172 million in new and protected tax receipts to HM Treasury, and could cost just £96 million over five years. <ref>{{cite web|author=Post comment Name Email Address Comments |url=http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-06/22/game-industry-tax-relief-plans-are-shelved |title=Game industry tax relief plans are shelved |publisher=Wired.co.uk |date=2010-06-22 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}</ref> Before the tax relief was introduced there was a fear that the UK games industry could fall behind other leading game industries around the world such as France and Canada, of which Canada overtook the UK in terms of job numbers in the industry in 2010. <ref>{{cite web| title=Canada overtakes UK |url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/34406/Canada-overtakes-UK-industry-workforce-tally |date=2012-3-31 |accessdate=2012-3-31}} </ref> . 

== Latest trends in the game industry == . 

A fairly recent practice, since the mid-1990s, of the video game industry is the rise of game players as developers of game content. The rise of video game players as fourth-party developers of game content allows for more [[open source]] models of [[game design]], development and engineering. Game players create user [[Mod (computer gaming)|modifications]] (mods), which in some cases become just as popular, maybe even more popular, as the original game created. An example of this is the game ''[[Counter-strike]]'', which began as a mod of the video game ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' and eventually became a published game in its own right that was very successful.  . 

While this "community of modifiers" may only add up to approximately 1% of a particular game's user base, the number of those involved will grow as more games offer modifying opportunities (such as, by releasing [[source code]]) and as the international community of gamers rise. According to Ben Sawyer, as many as 600,000 established online game community developers will exist by 2012. This will effectively add a new component to the [[video game industry#Game industry value chain|game industry value chain]] and if it continues to mature it will integrate itself into the overall industry. <ref name="newmedia" /> .
