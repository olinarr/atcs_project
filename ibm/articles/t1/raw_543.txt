[[File:ソフマップ 秋葉原 パソコン総合館 住友不動産秋葉原ビル側 エロゲ予約案内.jpg|An [[eroge]] (Japanese erotic game) shop in [[Akihabara]].|thumb|right]]The inclusion of '''sex and nudity in video games''' has been a controversial topic since the early days of the industry. While many games have used scantily clad images or characters to sell or enhance games (see [[sex in advertising]]), this article deals with games that use [[sex acts]] or [[nudity]] as a character motivation, in-game reward, or simply as a gameplay element. These games originate worldwide, on most [[computing platform|platforms]] and in most [[video game genre|genres]]. While releases in Europe and North America have been sporadic, Japan has seen the emergence of a distinct genre—the [[eroge]] (or erotic game).  . 

==History==. 
===1980s===. 
One of the earliest video games (if not the first) to feature sexual themes was the 1981 [[text adventure|text-based]] ''[[Softporn Adventure]]'', published by [[On-Line Systems]] for the [[Apple II]]. Despite heavy piracy the game still sold 25,000 copies, roughly equivalent to 25% of the number of Apple II's sold at the time. In a 1981 article in [[Time Magazine]], On-Line reported that they were making a version of the game for straight women, though this never materialized. <ref>http://www.ugo.com/games/softporn-adventure-best-game-ever</ref> In 1982, Japan's [[Koei]] released ''[[Night Life (video game)|Night Life]]''. <ref name=Retro>[http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/JPNcomputers/Japanesecomputers3.htm Retro Japanese Computers: Gaming's Final Frontier], Hardcore Gaming 101, reprinted from ''[[Retro Gamer]]'', Issue 67, 2009</ref> It was an early [[Graphic adventure game|graphic adventure]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Matthew T.|month=December|year=2005|title=The Impact of Telepresence on Cultural Transmission through Bishoujo Games|journal=PsychNology Journal|volume=3|issue=3|pages=292–311|url=http://www.psychnology.org/File/PNJ3(3)/PSYCHNOLOGY_JOURNAL_3_3_JONES.pdf|format=PDF|issn=1720-7525}}</ref> with sexually explicit images. <ref name=Retro/> That same year, Koei released another erotic title, ''Danchi Tsuma no Yuwaku'' (''Seduction of the Condominium Wife''),<ref name=Pesimo/> which was an early [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Danchizuma no Yuuwaku|publisher=Legendra|url=http://www.legendra.com/rpg/fiche-rpg_id-3276-rpg-danchizuma_no_yuuwaku.html#fichesr_33_3276|accessdate=2011-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Danchi-zuma no Yuuwaku|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/fm7/rpg/danchizumanoyuuwaku/index.html|accessdate=2011-03-16}}</ref> [[adventure game]] with colour graphics, owing to the eight-color palette of the [[NEC PC-8001]] computer. It became a hit, helping Koei become a major software company. <ref name=Pesimo>{{cite book|author=Pesimo, Rudyard Contretas|chapter='Asianizing' Animation in Asia: Digital Content Identity Construction Within the Animation Landscapes of Japan and Thailand|title=Reflections on the Human Condition: Change, Conflict and Modernity - The Work of the 2004/2005 API Fellows|year=2007|publisher=The Nippon Foundation|pages=124–160|chapterurl=http://www.apimal.org/blogcms/media/13/File/Pesimo.pdf}}</ref>   . 

That same year, the [[video game company]] [[Mystique (company)|Mystique]] released three unlicensed games for the [[Atari 2600]]; ''[[Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em]]'', ''[[Custer's Revenge]]'', and ''[[Bachelor Party (video game)|Bachelor Party]]''. The games were [[List of video games notable for negative reception|noted for their negative reception]], particularly ''Custer's Revenge'' for its depiction of (what was perceived as) [[George Armstrong Custer|General Custer]] raping [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] women. Despite the increased sales (due to one of the first instances of [[video game controversy]]), Mystique went out of business after only releasing these three games. A company named [[Playaround]] began distributing these games packaged in 2-in-1 "double-ender" cartridges. These games also included re-worked versions with female protagonists, ''Philly Flasher'' (''Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em''), ''Bachelorette Party'' (''Bachelor Party''), and ''General Retreat'' (''Custer's Revenge''). The re-released version of ''Custer's Revenge'' was titled ''Westward Ho!'', and featured slight modifications, such as the Native American woman beckoning to indicate that she welcomed Custer's advances. They released four new titles, ''Burning Desire/Jungle Fever'' and ''Cathouse Blues/Gigolo''. 1983 saw the release of another Atari 2600 game, ''[[X-Man (Atari 2600 video game)|X-Man]]''. ''X-man'' features the player as a nude man working through a maze toward a pink door in the center, past antagonistic crabs, teeth and scissors. Players that reached the pink door were rewarded with a controllable [[sex scene]].  . 

[[Enix]], [[Square (company)|Square]] and [[Nihon Falcom]] also released erotic adult games for the PC-8801 computer in the early 1980s before they became mainstream. Early eroge usually had simple stories, some even involving [[rape]], which often led to widespread condemnation from the Japanese media. In some of the early erotic games, the erotic content is meaningfully integrated into a thoughtful and mature storyline, though others often used it as a flimsy excuse for pornography. <ref name=Retro/> Erotic games made the PC-8801 popular, but customers quickly tired of paying 8800 yen ($85) for such simple games. Soon, new genres were invented: ASCII's ''Chaos Angels,'' a [[role-playing video game]]-based eroge, inspired ''[[Dragon Knight (hentai)|Dragon Knight]]'' by Elf and ''[[Rance (hentai)|Rance]]'' by [[AliceSoft]].  . 

In 1986 On-line Systems (now called [[Sierra On-Line]]) asked [[game designer]] [[Al Lowe]] to create an adult game in the [[graphical adventure]] style made popular by their ''[[King's Quest]]'' series. Lowe took the basic elements of ''Softporn Adventure'', greatly expanded it, and released it as the 1987 game ''[[Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards]]''. Sierra didn't advertise the game and retailers were loath to carry it, so initial sales were low. However [[word-of-mouth]] spread and soon the [[Leisure Suit Larry]] series was a success, spawning two sequels before the end of the decade, 1988's ''[[Leisure Suit Larry Goes Looking for Love (in Several Wrong Places)]]'', and 1989's  ''[[Leisure Suit Larry III: Passionate Patti in Pursuit of the Pulsating Pectorals]]''.  . 

===1990s===. 
With [[CD-ROM]] and multimedia based games in the 1990s, most adult games featured video clips with limited interactivity. Both pre-rendered and real-time 3D graphics were also used. While most games could be considered nothing more than [[pornography]], some attempted to include actual story and plot. This can be seen in some games with less explicit content, equal to an R or PG-13 rated movie.  . 

1990 saw the release of the first game in the ''[[Gals Panic]]'' series. The game was lifted gameplay off the older (non-sexual) game ''[[Qix]]''. The object of the games is to slowly remove pieces of the playing field while avoiding an enemy or groups of enemies. Removing the playing field slowly revealed a pictures of [[glamour model|model]]s in escalating states of undress. The game had nine sequels throughout the 90s (with a final game in 2002).  . 

In 1992, Elf released ''[[Dōkyūsei]]''. In it, before any eroticism, the user has to first win the affection of one of a number of female characters, making the story into an [[interactive fiction|interactive romance novel]]. Thus, the [[dating simulation|love simulation]] genre was invented. Soon afterwards, the video game ''Otogirisou'' on the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] attracted the attention of many Japanese gamers. ''Otogirisou'' was a standard adventure game but had multiple endings. This concept was called a "sound novel." . 

In 1996, the new software publisher [[Leaf (company)|Leaf]] expanded on this idea, calling it a [[visual novel]] and releasing their first successful game, ''[[Shizuku]],'' a horror story starring a rapist high school student, with very highly reviewed writing and music. Their next game, ''[[Kizuato]],'' was almost as dark. However, in 1997, they released ''[[To Heart]],'' a sweetly sentimental story of high school love that became one of the most famous and trendsetting eroge ever. ''To Heart'''s music was so popular it was added to [[karaoke]] machines throughout Japan—a first for eroge.  . 

After a similar game by [[Tactics (company)|Tactics]], ''[[One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e]],'' became a hit in 1998, [[Visual Art's]] scouted main creative staff of ''One'' to form a new brand under them, which became [[Key (company)|Key]]. In 1999, Key released ''[[Kanon]].'' It contains only about 7 brief erotic scenes in a sentimental story the size of a long novel (an all-ages version was also released afterward), but the enthusiasm of the response was unprecedented, and ''Kanon'' sold over 300,000 copies. In 2002 a 13-episode anime series was produced, as well as another 24-episode anime series in 2006. According to Satoshi TODOME's ''A History of Eroge,'' ''Kanon'' is still the standard for modern eroge and is referred to as a "baptism" for young [[otaku]]s in Japan. Although many eroge still market themselves primarily on sex, eroge that focus on story are now a major established part of Japanese [[otaku]] culture.  . 

===2000s===. 
Modern console publishers often have policies against depictions of nudity and explicit sexuality, particularly [[Sony]] with its [[PlayStation]] brand of consoles. Some titles featuring nudity, such as ''[[BMX XXX]]'', ''[[BoneTown]]'' and ''[[Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]] were censored, while versions on the [[Xbox]] and [[Nintendo GameCube]] were not. However, Sony allowed nudity in the title ''[[God of War (video game)|God of War]]'', which was also developed by Sony.  . 

A new generation of adult social games has emerged that bring multiple users together in sexual environments. Examples include ''[[Red Light Center]], [[Singles: Flirt Up Your Life]]'' and ''[[Playboy: The Mansion]]''. While it is not explicitly intended for purely adult-oriented entertainment, the virtual world of ''[[Second Life]]'', which is made up almost entirely of player-made content, has a very exotic array of adult entertainment including nudity and full-on sexual activities.  . 

Adult games may take the form of [[copyright infringement|bootleg]]s, circumventing mainstream publishers who may have policies against such games. [[Patch (computing)|Patch]]es or [[Hack (technology slang)|hacks]] to mainstream non-adult games may add sexual and pornographic themes, mostly for [[humor]], especially when sexuality was never intended in the original game. Examples include the ''[[Tomb Raider (series)|Tomb Raider]]'' video games, a ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' nude mod, ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]''' [[Hot Coffee mod]], ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'' (which has multiple such mods), [[Half-Life 2]]'s FakeFactory Cinematic Mod and [[read-only memory|ROM]] hacks for console [[emulator]]s.  . 

The Internet has allowed adult games to receive wider availability and recognition, including amateur games in Flash or Java. It has also allowed amateurs to create and distribute adult text adventure games, known as "Adult Interactive Fiction" or AIF.  . 

==Nudity in games==. 
Games that use nudity or partial nudity while not being considered erotic games include ''[[Cosmic Soldier (MSX)|Cosmic Soldier]]'', ''[[The Sims]]'', ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'', '' [[Fear Effect]]'', ''[[Fahrenheit (video game)|Fahrenheit]]'', ''[[Heavy Rain]]'', ''[[God of War (video game)|God of War]]'', ''[[The Sopranos: Road to Respect]]'', ''[[Dante's Inferno (video game)|Dante's Inferno]]'', ''[[Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne]]'', ''[[The Witcher 2]]'', ''[[L.A. Noire]]'', ''[[The Getaway]]'', ''[[Saints Row: The Third]]'', ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'', and [[Katawa Shoujo]], and still others that maintain content consistent with M or T ratings by the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]]. Nudity may be removed in localized versions, such as the Japanese version of God of War. Nudity may be removed for specific systems, such as Sony, Microsoft, or Nintendo consoles which have rating restriction policies.  .
