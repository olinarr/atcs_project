{{VG History}}
The '''history of [[video game]]s''' goes as far back as the 1940s, when in 1947 [[Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr.]] and Estle Ray Mann filed a [[United States patent]] request for an invention they described as a "[[cathode ray tube amusement device]]." Video gaming would not reach mainstream popularity until the [[1970s]] and [[1980s|80s]], when [[arcade game|arcade video games]], [[gaming console]]s and [[PC game|home computer games]] were introduced to the general public. Since then, video gaming has become a popular form of [[entertainment]] and a part of [[popular culture|modern culture]] in the [[developed world]]. There are currently considered to be eight generations of video game consoles, with the [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh]] and the [[History of video game consoles (eighth generation)|eighth]] concurrently ongoing.  .

On January 25, 1947, [[Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr.]] and Estle Ray Mann filed a [[United States patent]] request for an invention they described as a "[[cathode ray tube amusement device]]". <ref>{{Cite patent|US|2455992}}, also available from [http://www.jmargolin.com/patents/2455992.pdf JMargolin.com]</ref> This patent, which the [[United States Patent Office]] issued on December 14, 1948, details a machine in which a person uses knobs and buttons to manipulate a cathode ray tube beam to simulate firing at "air-borne" targets. A printed overlay on the CRT screen helps to define the playing field.  .

In 1949–1950, Charley Adama created a "Bouncing Ball" program for MIT's [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]] computer. <ref>[http://www.webbox.org/cgi/1949-50%20Whirlwind%20applications.html 1949-50 Whirlwind "bouncing Ball" demo program by Charly Adama] - Computer Graphic Timeline 1945-2000</ref> While the program was not yet interactive, it was a precursor to games soon to come.  . 

In February 1951, [[Christopher Strachey]] tried to run a [[draughts]] program he had written for the [[Pilot ACE|NPL Pilot ACE]]. The program exceeded the memory capacity of the machine and Strachey recoded his program for a machine at Manchester with a larger memory capacity by October.  . 

Also in 1951, while developing television technologies for New York based electronics company Loral, inventor Ralph Baer came up with the idea of using the lights and patterns he used in his work as more than just calibration equipment. He realized that by giving an audience the ability to manipulate what was projected on their television sets, their role changed from passive observing to interactive manipulation. When he took this idea to his supervisor, it was quickly squashed because the company was already behind schedule. <ref name="AmericanHeritage.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2009/3/2009_3_26.shtml|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110611012308/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2009/3/2009_3_26.shtml|archivedate=2011-06-11 |title=AmericanHeritage.com |publisher=AmericanHeritage.com |date=1966-09-01 |accessdate=2011-01-18}}</ref> . 

''[[OXO]]'', a graphical version of [[tic-tac-toe]], was created by [[A.S. Douglas]] in 1952 at the [[University of Cambridge]], in order to demonstrate his thesis on human-computer interaction. It was developed on the [[Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator|EDSAC]] computer, which uses a cathode ray tube as a visual display to display memory contents. The player competes against the computer.  .

===early 1950s–1969===. 
[[File:Spacewar!-PDP-1-20070512.jpg|right|thumb|180px|''[[Spacewar!]]'' is credited as the first widely available and influential computer game.]] . 

The majority of early [[Personal computer game|computer game]]s ran on universities' [[mainframe computer]]s in the United States and were developed by individuals as a hobby. The limited accessibility of early computer hardware meant that these games were small in number and forgotten by posterity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} . 

In 1959–1961, a collection of interactive graphical programs were created on the TX-0 machine at MIT: . 

*Mouse in the Maze: allowed players to place maze walls, bits of cheese, and, in some versions, martinis using a [[light pen]]. One could then release the mouse and watch it traverse the maze to find the goodies. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bitsavers.org/bits/MIT/tx-0/mouse/ |title=Index of /bits/MIT/tx-0/mouse |publisher=Bitsavers.org |date=2004-10-26 |accessdate=2011-01-18}}</ref>
*HAX: By adjusting two switches on the console, various graphical displays and sounds could be made. 
*Tic-Tac-Toe: Using the light pen, the user could play a simple game of [[tic-tac-toe]] against the computer.  . 

In 1961, a group of students at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], including [[Steve Russell]], programmed a game titled ''[[Spacewar!]]'' on the [[PDP-1|DEC PDP-1]], a new computer at the time. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cedmagic.com/history/dec-pdp-1.html|title=1960: DEC PDP-1 Precursor to the Minicomputer|publisher=CED Magic|accessdate=2008-12-04}}</ref> The game pitted two human players against each other, each controlling a [[spacecraft]] capable of firing missiles, while a [[star]] in the center of the screen created a large hazard for the crafts. The game was eventually distributed with new DEC computers and traded throughout the then-primitive [[History of the Internet|Internet]]. ''Spacewar!'' is credited as the first influential computer game.  . 

In 1966, [[Ralph H. Baer|Ralph Baer]] engaged co-worker Bill Harrison in the project, where they both worked at military electronics contractor Sanders Associates in Nashua, NH. They created a simple video game named ''Chase'', the first to display on a standard television set. With the assistance of Baer, Bill Harrison created the [[light gun]].  Baer and Harrison were joined by Bill Rusch in 1967, an MIT graduate (MSEE) who was subsequently awarded several patents for the TV gaming apparatus (US Patents 3,659,284, 3,778,058, etc.).  Development continued, and in 1968 a prototype was completed that could run several different games such as table tennis and target shooting. After months of secretive labouring between official projects, the team was able to bring an example with true promise to Sanders' R & D department. By 1969, Sanders was showing off the world’s first home video game console to manufacturers. <ref name="AmericanHeritage.com"/> . 

In 1969, [[AT&T]] computer programmer [[Ken Thompson]] wrote a video game called ''[[Space Travel (video game)|Space Travel]]'' for the [[Multics]] operating system. This game simulated various bodies of the solar system and their movements and the player could attempt to land a spacecraft on them. AT&T pulled out of the MULTICS project, and Thompson ported the game to [[Fortran]] code running on the [[General Comprehensive Operating System|GECOS]] operating system of the [[General Electric]] GE 635 mainframe computer. Runs on this system cost about $75 per hour, and Thompson looked for a smaller, less expensive computer to use. He found an underused [[PDP-7]], and he and [[Dennis Ritchie]] started porting the game to PDP-7 [[assembly language]]. In the process of learning to develop software for the machine, the development process of the [[Unix]] operating system began, and ''Space Travel'' has been called the first UNIX application. <ref>{{cite web| last =Ritchie| first =Dennis|title =Yes, A video game contributed to Unix Development|url =http://people.fas.harvard.edu/~lib215/reference/history/spacetravel.html|accessdate =2007-04-05  }}</ref> . 

==1970s==. 
===Early arcade video games (1971–1977)===. 
{{see also|Arcade game}} . 

In September 1971, the ''[[Galaxy Game]]'' was installed at a [[student activity center|student union]] at [[Stanford University]]. Based on ''Spacewar!'', this was the first coin-operated video game. Only one was built, using a DEC [[PDP-11]] and vector display terminals. In 1972 it was expanded to be able to handle four to eight consoles.  . 

Also in 1971, [[Nolan Bushnell]] and [[Atari|Ted Dabney]] created a coin-operated [[arcade game|arcade]] version of ''Spacewar!'' and called it ''[[Computer Space]]''. [[Nutting Associates]] bought the game and manufactured 1,500 ''Computer Space'' machines, with the release taking place in November 1971. The game was unsuccessful due to its steep learning curve, but was a landmark as the first mass-produced video game and the first offered for commercial sale.  . 

Bushnell and Dabney founded [[Atari, Inc.]] in 1972, before releasing their next game: ''[[Pong]]''. ''Pong'' was the first arcade video game with widespread success. The game is loosely based on [[table tennis]]: a ball is "served" from the center of the court and as the ball moves towards their side of the court each player must maneuver their paddle to hit the ball back to their opponent. Atari sold over 19,000 ''Pong'' machines,<ref>{{citation|title=Computer and Video Game Law: Cases and Materials|author=Ashley S. Lipson & Robert D.

Pong made its first appearance in 1972 at "Andy Capp's," a small bar in Sunnyvale, California, where the video game was literally "overplayed" as eager customers tried to cram quarters into an already heavily overloaded coin slot.}}</ref> creating many imitators.  .

===First generation consoles (1972–1977)===. 
{{Main|History of video game consoles (first generation)}}
[[File:Magnavox-Odyssey-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Magnavox Odyssey]]]]
The first home 'console' system was developed by [[Ralph H. Baer|Ralph Baer]] and his associates. Development began in 1966 and a working prototype was completed by 1968 (called the "Brown Box") for demonstration to various potential licensees, including GE, Sylvania, RCA, Philco, and Sears, with Magnavox eventually licensing the technology to produce the world's first home video game console. <ref>{{Cite book| title=Game Industry Career Guide | last1=Moore | first1=Michael E. | last2=Novak | first2=Jeannie  | year=2010 | publisher=Cengage Learning | location=Delmar | isbn=1-4283-7647-X | page=7 | quote=In 1966, Ralph H. Baer .. pitched an idea .. to create interactive games to be played on the television. Over the next two years, his team developed the first video game system—and in 1968, they demonstrated the "Brown Box," a device on which several games could be played and that used a light gun to shoot targets on the screen. After several more years of development, the system was licensed by Magnavox in 1970 and the first game console system, the Odyssey, was released in 1972 at the then high price of $100. }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2009/3/2009_3_26.shtml|title=The Father of Video Games|first=Mark|last=Wolverton|accessdate=March 31, 2010|work=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]}}</ref> The system was released in the USA in 1972 by Magnavox, called the [[Magnavox Odyssey]]. The Odyssey used cartridges that mainly consisted of jumpers that enabled/disabled various switches inside the unit, altering the circuit logic (as opposed to later video game systems that used programmable cartridges). This provided the ability to play several different games using the same system, along with plastic sheet overlays taped to the television that added color, play-fields, and various graphics to 'interact' with using the electronic images generated by the system. <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=R9kTAQAAIAAJ "Videogames: In the Beginning"] by [[Ralph H. Baer|Ralph Baer]], published by Rolenta Press, 2005  ISBN 0-9643848-1-7, 9780964384811</ref> A major marketing push, featuring TV advertisements starring [[Frank Sinatra]], helped Magnavox sell about 100,000 Odysseys that first year. <ref name="AmericanHeritage.com"/> . 

Philips bought Magnavox and released a different game in Europe using the Odyssey brand in 1974 and an evolved game that Magnavox had been developing for the US market. Over its production span, the Odyssey system achieved sales of 2 million units.  . 

===Mainframe computers===. 
University mainframe game development blossomed in the early 1970s. There is little record of all but the most popular games, as they were not marketed or regarded as a serious endeavor. The people–generally students–writing these games often were doing so illicitly by making questionable use of very expensive computing resources, and thus were not anxious to let very many people know of their endeavors. There were, however, at least two notable distribution paths for student game designers of this time: . 

*The [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO system]] was an educational computing environment designed at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]] and which ran on mainframes made by [[Control Data Corporation]]. Games were often exchanged between different PLATO systems. 
* [[DECUS]] was the [[Users' group|user group]] for computers made by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC). It distributed programs–including games–that would run on the various types of DEC computers.  . 

A number of noteworthy games were also written for [[Hewlett-Packard]] minicomputers such as the [[HP2000]].  . 

Highlights of this period, in approximate chronological order, include: . 

* [[1971 in video gaming|1971]]: [[Don Daglow]] wrote a [[baseball (1971 video game)|computer baseball]] game on a DEC [[PDP-10]] mainframe at [[Pomona College]]. Players could manage individual games or simulate an entire season. Daglow went on to team with programmer [[Eddie Dombrower]] to design ''[[Earl Weaver Baseball]]'', published by [[Electronic Arts]] in 1987. 
*1971: ''[[Star Trek (text game)|Star Trek]]'' was created (probably by [[Mike Mayfield]]) on a [[SDS Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] [[minicomputer]] at [[University of California]]. This is the best-known and most widely played of the 1970s ''Star Trek'' titles, and was played on a series of small "maps" of galactic sectors printed on paper or on the screen. It was the first major game to be ported across hardware platforms by students. Daglow also wrote a popular ''[[Star Trek (script game)|Star Trek game]]'' for the PDP-10 during 1970–1972, which presented the action as a script spoken by the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|TV program]]'s characters. A number of other ''Star Trek'' themed games were also available via PLATO and DECUS throughout the decade. 
*[[1972 in video gaming|1972]]: [[Gregory Yob]] wrote the  hide-and-seek game ''[[Hunt the Wumpus]]'' for the PDP-10, which could be considered the first text adventure. Yob wrote it in reaction to existing hide-and-seek games such as ''[[Hurkle]]'', ''[[Mugwump (game)|Mugwump]]'', and ''[[What to Do After You Hit Return or P.C.C.'s First Book of Computer Games|Snark]]''. 
*[[1974 in video gaming|1974]]: Both ''[[Maze War]]'' (on the [[Imlac PDS-1]] at the [[NASA Ames Research Center]] in California) and ''[[Spasim]]'' (on PLATO) appeared, pioneering examples of early multi-player 3D [[first-person shooter]]s. 
* [[1974 in video gaming|1974]]: Brand Fortner and others developed ''[[Airfight]]'' as an educational flight simulator. To make it more interesting, all players shared an airspace flying their choice of military jets, loaded with selected weapons and fuel and to fulfill their desire to shoot down other players' aircraft. Despite mediocre graphics and slow screen refresh, it became a popular game on the [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO system]]. ''Airfight'' was the inspiration for what became the Microsoft Flight Simulator. 
*[[1975 in video gaming|1975]]: [[William Crowther]] wrote the first modern [[interactive fiction|text adventure]] game, ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure|Adventure]]'' (originally called ''ADVENT'', and later ''Colossal Cave''). It was programmed in [[Fortran]] for the PDP-10. The player controls the game through simple sentence-like text commands and receives descriptive text as output. The game was later re-created by students on PLATO, so it is one of the few titles that became part of both the PLATO and DEC traditions. 
*1975: By 1975, many universities had discarded these terminals for [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] screens, which could display thirty lines of text in a few seconds instead of the minute or more that printing on paper required. This led to the development of a series of games that drew "graphics" on the screen.  The CRTs replaced the typical [[teleprinter]]s or [[line printer]]s that output at speeds ranging from 10 to 30 characters per second. 
*1975: Daglow, then a student at [[Claremont Graduate University]], wrote the first [[role-playing video game]] on PDP-10 mainframes: ''[[Dungeon (video game)|Dungeon]]''. The game was an unlicensed implementation of the new [[tabletop role-playing game]] ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''. Although displayed in text, it was the first game to use ''[[line of sight (gaming)|line of sight]]'' graphics, as the top-down dungeon maps showing the areas that the party had seen or could see took into consideration factors such as light or darkness and the differences in vision between species. 
* 1975: At about the same time, the game ''[[dnd (computer game)|dnd]]'', also based on ''Dungeons and Dragons'' first appeared on PLATO system CDC computers. For players in these schools ''dnd'', not ''Dungeon'', was the first computer role-playing video game. 
* 1976: The earliest [[role-playing video game]]s to use elements from ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' are ''[[Telengard]]'', written in 1976, and ''[[Zork]]'' (later renamed ''[[Dungeon (computer game)|Dungeon]]''), written in 1977. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.malinche.net/zork.html |title=Zork Turns 30 |author=Michael Feir |year=2007 |quote=In the brief time that Zork was known as Dungeon, the Fortran version of Dungeon was widely circulated which caused the name Dungeon to stick in some circles and sectors to this day.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Infocom/dungeon.html |title=Dungeon |author=Peter Scheyen |year=1996 |quote='''Version''' FORTRAN IV Zork (Dungeon) '''Release Date''' January 1978 '''Authors''' A somewhat paranoid DEC engineer}}</ref>
* [[1977 in video gaming|1977]]: [[Kelton Flinn]] and John Taylor create the first version of ''[[Air (1977 video game)|Air]]'', a text air combat game that foreshadowed their later work creating the first-ever graphical online multi-player game, ''[[Air Warrior]]''. They would found the first successful online game company, [[Kesmai]], now part of [[Electronic Arts]]. As Flinn has said: "If Air Warrior was a primate swinging in the trees, AIR was the text-based amoeba crawling on the ocean floor. But it was quasi-real time, multi-player, and attempted to render 3-D on the terminal using ASCII graphics. It was an acquired taste."{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
* 1977: The writing of the original ''[[Zork]]'' was started by [[Dave Lebling]], [[Marc Blank]], [[Tim Anderson (Zork)|Tim Anderson]], and [[Bruce Daniels]]. Unlike Crowther, Daglow and Yob, the Zork team recognized the potential to move these games to the new personal computers and they founded [[Interactive fiction|text adventure]] publisher [[Infocom]] in 1979. The company was later sold to [[Activision]]. 
* 1978: ''[[MUD1|Multi-User Dungeon]]'', the first [[MUD]], was created by [[Roy Trubshaw]] and [[Richard Bartle]], beginning the heritage that culminates with today's [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPGs]]. 
* [[1980 in video gaming|1980]]: [[Michael Toy]], [[Glenn Wichman]] and [[Ken Arnold]] released [[Rogue (computer game)|Rogue]] on BSD Unix after two years of work, inspiring many [[roguelike]] games ever since. Like ''[[Dungeon (video game)|Dungeon]]'' on the PDP-10 and ''[[dnd (computer game)|dnd]]'' on PLATO, ''Rogue'' displayed dungeon maps using text characters. Unlike those games, however, the dungeon was randomly generated for each play session, so the path to treasure and the enemies who protected it were different for each game. As the ''Zork'' team had done, ''Rogue'' was adapted for home computers and became a commercial product.  . 

===Video game crash of 1977===. 
[[File:Atari-2600-Wood-4Sw-Set.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Atari 2600]]]]
In 1977, manufacturers of older, obsolete consoles and ''[[Pong]]'' clones sold their systems at a loss to clear stock, creating a glut in the market,<ref name="Whittaker-122"/> and causing [[Fairchild Semiconductor|Fairchild]] and [[RCA]] to abandon their game consoles. Only [[Atari]] and [[Magnavox]] remained in the home console market, despite suffering losses in 1977 and 1978. <ref name="Montfort-66">{{citation|title=Racing the beam: the Atari Video computer system|author=Nick Montfort & Ian Bogost|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|year=2009|isbn=026201257X|page=66|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DqePfdz_x6gC&pg=PA66|accessdate=2011-05-01}}</ref> . 

The crash was largely caused by the significant number of ''Pong'' clones that flooded both the arcade and home markets. The crash eventually came to an end with the success of [[Taito Corporation|Taito]]'s ''[[Space Invaders]]'', released in 1978, sparking a renaissance for the video game industry and paving the way for the [[golden age of video arcade games]]. <ref name="Whittaker-122">{{citation|title=The cyberspace handbook|author=Jason Whittaker|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2004|isbn=041516835X|page=122}}</ref> Soon after, ''Space Invaders'' was licensed for the [[Atari 2600|Atari VCS]] (later known as Atari 2600), becoming the first "[[killer app]]" and quadrupling the console's sales. <ref name="RG-41">{{Cite journal| month= September | year= 2007| title= The Definitive Space Invaders| journal= [[Retro Gamer]]| publisher= [[Imagine Publishing]]|issue= 41| pages= 24–33 | url= http://www.nowgamer.com/features/894697/the_definitive_space_invaders_part_1.html | accessdate=2011-04-20}}</ref> This helped Atari recover from their earlier losses. <ref name="Montfort-66"/> The success of the Atari 2600 in turn revived the home video game market, up until the [[North American video game crash of 1983]]. <ref>{{citation|title=The cyberspace handbook|author=Jason Whittaker|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2004|isbn=041516835X|pages=122–3}}</ref> . 

===Second generation consoles (1977–1983)===. 
{{Main|History of video game consoles (second generation)}} . 

In the earliest consoles, the computer code for one or more games was hardcoded into microchips using [[logic gate|discrete logic]], and no additional games could ever be added. By the mid-1970s video games were found on [[ROM cartridge|cartridges]], starting in 1976 with the release of the [[Fairchild Channel F|Fairchild Video Entertainment System (VES)]]. Programs were burned onto [[Read-only memory|ROM]] chips that were mounted inside plastic cartridge casings that could be plugged into slots on the console. When the cartridges were plugged in, the general-purpose [[microprocessor]]s in the consoles read the cartridge memory and executed whatever program was stored there. Rather than being confined to a small selection of games included in the game system, consumers could now amass libraries of game cartridges. However video game production was still a niche skill. Warren Robinett, the famous programmer of the game Adventure, spoke on developing games "in those old far-off days, each game for the 2600 was done entirely by one person, the programmer, who conceived the game concept, wrote the program, did the graphics—drawn first on graph paper and converted by hand to hexadecimal—and did the sounds."<ref>{{cite web|last=Agger |first=Michael |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/the_browser/2009/03/speak_atari.html |title=Slate.com |publisher=Slate.com |date=2009-03-09 |accessdate=2011-01-18}}</ref> . 

Three machines dominated the second generation of consoles in North America, far outselling their rivals: . 

*The [[Atari 2600|Video Computer System]] (VCS) ROM cartridge-based console, later renamed the Atari 2600, was released in 1977 by Atari. Nine games were designed and released for the holiday season. While the console had a slow start, its port of the arcade game ''[[Space Invaders]]'' would become the first "[[killer app]]" and quadruple the console's sales. <ref name="RG-41"/> Soon after, the Atari 2600 would quickly become the most popular of all the early consoles prior to the [[North American video game crash of 1983]]. 
*The [[Intellivision]], introduced by [[Mattel]] in 1980. Though chronologically part of what is called the "8-bit era", the Intellivision had a unique processor with instructions that were 10 bits wide (allowing more instruction variety and potential speed), and registers 16 bits wide. The system, which featured graphics superior to the older Atari 2600, rocketed to popularity. 
*The [[ColecoVision]], an even more powerful machine, appeared in 1982. With its port of arcade game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' included as a [[pack-in game|pack-in]], sales for this console also took off. However, the presence of three major consoles in the marketplace and a glut of poor quality games began to overcrowd retail shelves and erode consumers' interest in video games. Within a year, this overcrowded market would crash.  . 

In 1979, [[Activision]] was created by disgruntled former Atari programmers "who realized that the games they had anonymously programmed on their $20K salaries were responsible for 60 percent of the company's $100 million in cartridge sales for one year". <ref>{{cite web|last=Agger |first=Michael |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2213124/pagenum/all/#p2 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110401181748/http://www.slate.com/id/2213124/pagenum/all/#p2 |archivedate=2011-04-01 |title=Slate.com |publisher=Slate.com |date=2009-03-09 |accessdate=2011-01-18}}</ref> It was the first [[video game developer|third-party developer]] of video games.

===Home computer games (late 1970s–early 1980s)===. 
{{see also|Personal computer game}} . 

While the fruit of retail development in early video games appeared mainly in video arcades and home consoles, [[home computer]]s began appearing in the late 1970s and were rapidly evolving in the 80s, allowing their owners to program simple games. [[Hobby]]ist groups for the new computers soon formed and [[personal computer game]] software followed.  . 

Soon many of these games—at first clones of mainframe classics such as ''Star Trek'', and then later ports or clones of popular arcade games such as ''[[Space Invaders]]'', ''[[Frogger]]'',<ref name="Enterprise-1982">{{citation|title=Cash In On the Video Game Craze|work=[[Black Enterprise]]|date=December 1982|volume=12|issue=5|issn=0006-4165|pages=41–2|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=N6pacvfrf0wC&pg=PA41|accessdate=2011-05-01}}</ref> ''[[Pac-Man]]'' (see [[Pac-Man clones|''Pac-Man'' clones]])<ref name="Markoff-1981">{{citation|title=Atari acts in an attempt to scuttle software pirates|author=John Markoff|work=[[InfoWorld]]|date=30 November 1981|volume=3|issue=28|issn=0199-6649|pages=28–9|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SD0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA28|accessdate=2011-05-01}}</ref> and ''[[Donkey Kong]]''<ref>{{citation|title=Strategic management: an integrated approach|author=Charles W.

Early game designers like Crowther, Daglow and Yob would find the computer code for their games—which they had never thought to copyright—published in books and magazines, with their names removed from the listings. Early home computers from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Commodore International|Commodore]], [[Tandy Corporation|Tandy]] and others had many games that people typed in.  . 

Games were also distributed by the physical mailing and selling of floppy disks, cassette tapes, and [[read-only memory|ROM]] cartridges. Soon a small [[cottage industry]] was formed, with amateur programmers selling disks in plastic bags put on the shelves of local shops or sent through the [[mail]]. [[Richard Garriott]] distributed several copies of his 1980 [[role-playing video game]] ''[[Akalabeth: World of Doom]]'' in plastic bags before the game was published.  . 

==1980s==. 
{{Main|1980s in video gaming}} . 

The computer gaming industry experienced its first major growing pains in the early 1980s as publishing houses appeared, with many honest businesses—occasionally surviving at least 20 years, such as [[Electronic Arts]]—alongside [[wiktionary:fly-by-night|fly-by-night]] operations that cheated the games' developers. While some early '80s games were simple clones of existing arcade titles, the relatively low publishing costs for personal computer games allowed for bold, unique games.  . 

===Genre innovation===. 
{{see also|Golden age of video arcade games}} . 

The [[golden age of video arcade games]] reached its zenith in the 1980s. The age brought with it many technically innovative and genre-defining games developed and released in the first few years of the decade, including: . 

*'''[[Action adventure game]]''': ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' (1986) helped establish the action-adventure genre, combining elements from different genres to create a compelling hybrid, including exploration, transport [[Puzzle game|puzzles]], [[Adventure game|adventure]]-style inventory puzzles, an [[Action game|action]] component, a [[monetary system]], and simplified [[role-playing video game|RPG]]-style [[Level up|level building]] without the [[experience point]]s. <ref>{{cite web|author=var authorId = "" by Travis Fahs |url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/939/939361p1.html |title=IGN Presents the History of Zelda - Retro Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.retro.ign.com |date=2010-08-27 |accessdate=2011-01-18}}</ref> The game was also an early example of [[open world]], [[nonlinear gameplay]], and introduced innovations like battery backup [[Saved game|saving]]. <ref>{{cite web|title=15 Most Influential Games of All Time: The Legend of Zelda|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/15influential/p9_01.html|accessdate=2010-01-24}}</ref> . 

*'''[[Action role-playing game]]s''': ''[[Dragon Slayer II: Xanadu]]'' (1985) is considered the first full-fledged [[action role-playing game]], with character stats and a large quest, with its action-based combat setting it apart from other [[role-playing video game|RPGs]]. ''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link]]'' (1987), developed by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], further defined and popularized the emerging action-RPG genre.  . 

*'''[[Adventure game]]s''': ''[[Zork]]'' (1980) further popularized [[Interactive fiction|text adventure]] games in [[home computer]]s and established developer [[Infocom]]’s dominance in the field. As these early computers often lacked graphical capabilities, text adventures proved successful. ''[[Mystery House]]'' (1980), [[Roberta Williams]]'s game for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]], was the first [[graphic adventure game]] on home computers. Graphics consisted entirely of static monochrome drawings, and the interface still used the typed commands of text adventures. It proved very popular at the time, and she and husband Ken went on to found [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-Line]], a major producer of adventure games. ''[[King's Quest]]'' (1984) was created by [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra]], laying the groundwork for the modern adventure game. It featured color graphics and a [[virtual camera system|third-person]] perspective. An on-screen [[player character]] could be moved behind and in front of objects on a 2D background drawn in [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]], creating the illusion of pseudo-3D space. Commands were still entered via text. ''[[Maniac Mansion]]'' (1987) removed text entry from adventure games. [[LucasArts]]  built the [[SCUMM]] system to allow a [[point-and-click]] interface. Sierra and other game companies quickly followed with their own mouse-driven games.  . 

*'''[[Beat 'em up]]''': [[Karateka (video game)|Karateka]] (1984), with its pioneering rotoscoped animation, and ''[[Kung-Fu Master]]'' (1984), a [[Hong Kong action cinema|Hong Kong cinema]]-inspired [[action game]], laid the foundations for [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[beat 'em up]]s with simple gameplay and multiple enemies. <ref name = "CGW">Kunkel, Bill; Worley, Joyce; Katz, Arnie, "The Furious Fists of Sega!", ''Computer Gaming World'', Oct 1988, pp. 48-49</ref> ''[[Kunio-kun (series)#Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-Kun (original game)|Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun]]'' (1986), also released as ''[[Renegade (video game)|Renegade]]'', deviated from the martial arts themes of earlier game, introducing street brawling to the genre,<ref name="tao2">Spencer, Spanner, [http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/a_taoofbeatemups_pt2_retro The Tao of Beat-'em-ups (part 2)], ''EuroGamer'', Feb 12, 2008, Accessed Mar 18, 2009</ref> and set the standard for future beat 'em up games as it introduced the ability to move both horizontally and vertically. <ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/stories/s2067970.htm Evolution of a Genre: Beat 'Em Ups],'' ABC Television'', Nov 6, 2007.

*'''Computer [[role-playing video game]]s''': ''[[Akalabeth: World of Doom|Akalabeth]]'' (1980) was created in the same year as ''[[Rogue (video game)|Rogue]]'' (1980); Akalabeth led to the creation of its spiritual sequel ''[[Ultima I: The First Age of Darkness|Ultima]]'' (1981). Its sequels were the inspiration for some of the first Japanese [[role-playing video game]]s, alongside ''[[Wizardry]]'' (1981). [[The Bard's Tale (1985 video game)|''The Bard's Tale'']] (1985) by [[Interplay Entertainment]] is considered the first computer role-playing video game to appeal to a wide audience that was not matched until [[Blizzard Entertainment]]'s [[Diablo (video game)|''Diablo'']]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1706/the_history_of_computer_.php?page=2|title=The History of Computer Role-Playing Games Part 2: The Golden Age (1985-1993)|page=2|first=Matt|last=Barton|publisher=Gamasutra|date=2007-02-25|accessdate=2009-08-20}}</ref> .

It is considered a pioneer of the [[space flight simulator game]] genre.  . 

*'''[[Visual novel]]s''': ''[[Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken]]'' (1983), developed by [[Yuji Horii]] (of ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' fame), was the first [[visual novel]] and one of the earliest Japanese [[graphic adventure game]]s. It is viewed in a [[First person (video games)|first-person perspective]], follows a [[first-person narrative]], and was the first Japanese adventure game to feature colour graphics. It inspired [[Hideo Kojima]] (of ''[[Metal Gear (series)|Metal Gear]]'' fame) to enter the video game industry and later produce his own classic graphic adventure, ''[[Snatcher]]'' (1988).  . 

===Gaming computers===. 
Following the success of the [[Apple II series|Apple II]] and [[Commodore PET]] in the late 1970s a series of cheaper and incompatible rivals emerged in the early 1980s. This second batch included the Commodore [[Vic 20]] and [[Commodore 64|64]]; Sinclair [[ZX80]], [[ZX81]] and [[ZX Spectrum]]; [[NEC PC-8000]], [[NEC PC-6001|PC-6001]], [[NEC PC-8801|PC-88]] and [[NEC PC-9801|PC-98]]; [[Sharp X1]] and [[Sharp X68000|X68000]]; and [[Atari 8-bit family]], [[BBC Micro]], [[Acorn Electron]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[MSX]] series. These rivals helped to catalyze both the [[Home Computer]] and Games markets, by raising awareness of computing and gaming through their competing advertising campaigns.  . 

The Sinclair, Acorn and Amstrad offerings were generally only known in Europe and Africa, the NEC and Sharp offerings were generally only known in Asia, and the MSX had a base in North and South America, Europe, and Asia, whilst the US based Apple, Commodore and Atari offerings were sold in both the USA and Europe.  . 

In 1984, the computer gaming market took over from the console market following the crash of that year; computers offered equal gaming ability and since their simple design allowed games to take complete command of the hardware after power-on, they were nearly as simple to start playing with as consoles.  . 

[[File:Commodore-64-Computer.jpg|thumb|right|The Commodore 64 system]]
The [[Commodore 64]] was released to the public in August 1982. It found initial success because it was marketed and priced aggressively. It had a [[BASIC]] programming environment and advanced graphic and sound capabilities for its time, similar to the [[ColecoVision]] console. It also utilized the same game controller ports popularized by the Atari 2600, allowing gamers to use their old joysticks with the system. It would become the most popular home computer of its day in the USA and many other countries and the best-selling single computer model of all time internationally.  . 

At around the same time, the Sinclair [[ZX Spectrum]] was released in the United Kingdom and quickly became the most popular home computer in many areas of Western Europe—and later the [[Eastern Bloc]]—due to the ease with which clones could be produced.  . 

The [[IBM PC compatible]] computer became a technically competitive gaming platform with [[IBM]]’s [[IBM Personal Computer/AT|PC/AT]] in 1984. The primitive 4-color [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] graphics of previous models had limited the PC’s appeal to the business segment, as its graphics failed to compete with the C64 or Apple II. The new 16-color [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] display standard allowed its graphics to approach the quality seen in popular [[home computer]]s like the Commodore 64. The sound capabilities of the AT, however, were still limited to the [[PC speaker]], which was substandard compared to the built-in [[sound chip]]s used in many home computers. Also, the relatively high cost of the PC compatible systems severely limited their popularity in gaming.  . 

The Apple [[Macintosh]] also arrived at this time. It lacked the color capabilities of the earlier [[Apple II series|Apple II]], instead preferring a much higher pixel resolution, but the operating system support for the [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] attracted developers of some interesting games (e.g. ''[[Lode Runner]]'') even before color returned in 1987 with the Mac II.  . 

The arrival of the [[Atari ST]] and Commodore [[Amiga]] in 1985 was the beginning of a new era of 16-bit machines. For many users they were too expensive until later on in the decade, at which point advances in the IBM PC’s open platform had caused the [[IBM PC compatible]]s to become comparably powerful at a lower cost than their competitors. The [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] standard developed for IBM’s new [[IBM Personal System/2|PS/2]] line in 1987 gave the PC the potential for 256-color graphics. This was a big jump ahead of most 8-bit [[home computer]]s but still lagging behind platforms with built-in sound and graphics hardware like the Amiga. This caused an odd trend around '89-91 towards developing to a seemingly inferior machine. Thus while both the ST and Amiga were host to many technically excellent games, their time of prominence proved to be shorter than that of the 8-bit machines, which saw new ports well into the 80s and even the 90s.  . 

[[File:Yamaha YM3812.jpg|thumb|140px|The [[Yamaha YM3812]] sound chip.]]
Dedicated [[sound card]]s started to address the issue of poor sound capabilities in [[IBM PC compatible]]s in the late 1980s. [[Ad Lib, Inc.|Ad Lib]] set an early de facto standard for sound cards in 1987, with its card based on the [[Yamaha YM3812]] sound chip. This would last until the introduction of [[Creative Technology|Creative Labs]]' [[Sound Blaster]] in 1989, which took the chip and added new features while remaining compatible with [[Ad Lib, Inc.|Ad Lib]] cards, and creating a new de facto standard. However, many games would still support these and rarer things like the [[Roland MT-32]] and [[Covox Speech Thing|Disney Sound Source]] into the early 90s. The initial high cost of sound cards meant they would not find widespread use until the 1990s.  . 

[[Shareware]] gaming first appeared in the mid 1980s, but its big successes came in the 1990s. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} . 

===Early online gaming===. 
[[Dial-up Internet access|Dial-up]] [[bulletin board system]]s were popular in the 1980s, and sometimes used for online game playing. The earliest such systems were in the late 1970s and early 1980s and had a crude plain-text interface. Later systems made use of terminal-control codes (the so-called [[ANSI art]], which included the use of IBM-PC-specific characters not part of an [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] standard) to get a [[Box drawing characters|pseudo-graphical]] interface. Some BBSs offered access to various games which were playable through such an interface, ranging from text adventures to gambling games like [[blackjack]] (generally played for "points" rather than real money). On some multiuser BBSs (where more than one person could be online at once), there were games allowing users to interact with one another.  . 

[[SuperSet Software]] created ''[[Snipes (video game)|Snipes]]'', a text-mode networked computer game in 1983 to test a new [[IBM Personal Computer]] based computer network and demonstrate its capabilities. ''Snipes'' is officially credited as being the original inspiration for [[Novell NetWare]]. It is believed to be the first network game ever written for a commercial personal computer and is recognized alongside 1974’s ''[[Maze War]]'' (a networked multiplayer maze game for several research machines) and ''[[Spasim]]'' (a 3D multiplayer space simulation for time shared [[mainframe computer|mainframes]]) as the precursor to multiplayer games such as 1987's ''[[MIDI Maze]]'', and ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]'' in 1993. 
Commercial online services also arose during this decade. The first user interfaces were plain-text—similar to BBSs— but they operated on large mainframe computers, permitting larger numbers of users to be online at once. By the end of the decade, inline services had fully graphical environments using software specific to each personal computer platform. Popular text-based services included [[CompuServe]], [[The Source (online service)|The Source]], and [[GEnie]], while platform-specific graphical services included [[PlayNET]] and [[Quantum Link]] for the [[Commodore 64]], [[AppleLink]] for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]] and [[Macintosh]], and [[AOL#History|PC Link]] for the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]]—all of which were run by the company which eventually became [[AOL|America Online]]—and a competing service, [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]]. Interactive games were a feature of these services, though until 1987 they used text-based displays, not graphics.  . 

===Handheld LCD games===. 
In 1979, [[Milton Bradley Company]] released the first handheld system using interchangeable cartridges, [[Microvision]]. While the handheld received modest success in the first year of production, the lack of games, screen size and video game crash of 1983 brought about the system's quick demise. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2006/03/03/a-brief-history-of-handheld-video-games/|title=A Brief History of Handheld Video Games|first=Donald|last=Melanson|publisher=Weblogs, Inc.|date=2006-03-03|accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref> . 

In 1980, [[Nintendo]] released its [[Game & Watch]] line, [[handheld electronic game]] which spurred dozens of other game and toy companies to make their own portable games, many of which were copies of Game & Watch titles or adaptations of popular arcade games. Improving [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] technology meant the new handhelds could be more reliable and consume fewer batteries than [[light-emitting diode|LED]] or [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] games, most only needing watch batteries. They could also be made much smaller than most LED handhelds, even small enough to wear on one’s wrist like a watch. [[Tiger Electronics]] borrowed this concept of videogaming with cheap, affordable handhelds and still produces games in this model to the present day.  . 

===Video game crash of 1983===. 
{{Main|North American video game crash of 1983}}
At the end of 1983, the industry experienced losses more severe than the 1977 crash. This was the "crash" of the video game industry, as well as the bankruptcy of several companies that produced North American home computers and video game consoles from late 1983 to early 1984. It brought an end to what is considered to be the second generation of console video gaming. Causes of the crash include the production of poorly-designed games, the most notorious of which included ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (video game)|E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' and ''[[Pac-Man (Atari 2600)|Pac-Man]]'' for the [[Atari 2600]] console.   Popular lore surrounding this now-legendary crash states that sales of ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' diverged so poorly from their forecasts, that [[Atari video game burial|Atari buried thousands of unsold cartridges]] in a landfill in New Mexico.  . 

===Third generation consoles (1983–1995) (8-bit)===. 
{{Main|History of video game consoles (third generation)}} . 

[[File:NES-Console-Set.jpg|left|thumb|180px|The [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] or NES.]]
In 1985, the Video Game Console market was revived with Nintendo’s release of its [[8-bit]] console, the Famicom, known outside Asia as [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES). It was bundled with ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' and instantly became a success. The NES dominated the North American and the Japanese market until the rise of the next generation of consoles in the early 1990s. Other markets were not as heavily dominated, allowing other consoles to find an audience like the [[Sega Master System]] in Europe, Australia and Brazil (though it was sold in North America as well).  . 

In the new consoles, the [[gamepad]] or joypad, took over [[joystick]]s, [[paddle (game controller)|paddle]]s, and [[keypad]]s as the default [[game controller]] included with the system. The gamepad design of an 8 direction Directional-pad (or [[D-pad]] for short) with 2 or more action buttons became the standard. This generation also marked a shift in the dominance of home video games from the [[United States]] to [[Japan]]. <ref name="cgw_50">{{citation|author=Arnie Katz, Bill Kunkel, Joyce Worley|title=[[Computer Gaming World]]|year=1988|month=August|issue=50|page=44|chapter=Video Gaming World|quote=I'm sure you've noticed that I've made no reference to the Nintendo craze that has repeated the Atari and Mattel Phenomenon of 8 years ago. That's because for American game designers the Nintendo is a non-event: virtually all the work to date has been done in Japan. Only the future will tell if the design process ever crosses the Pacific as efficiently as the container ships and the letters of credit now do.}}</ref> . 

The [[The Legend of Zelda|''Legend of Zelda'' series]] made its debut in 1986 with ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]''.  In the same year, the [[Dragon Quest|''Dragon Quest'' series]] debuted with ''[[Dragon Warrior|Dragon Quest]]'', and has created a phenomenon in Japanese culture ever since.  The next year, the Japanese company [[Square Co.|Square]] was struggling and [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] decided to make his final game—a role-playing game (RPG) modeled after ''Dragon Quest'' and titled ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]''—resulting in [[Final Fantasy|''Final Fantasy'' series]], which would later go on to become the most successful RPG franchise. 1987 also saw the birth of the [[stealth game]] genre with [[Hideo Kojima]]’s [[Metal Gear (series)|''Metal Gear'' series]]' first game ''[[Metal Gear]]'' on the [[MSX]]2 computer—and ported to the NES shortly after. In 1989, [[Capcom]] released ''[[Sweet Home (video game)|Sweet Home]]'' on the NES, which served as a precursor to the [[survival horror]] genre.  . 

In 1988, Nintendo published their first issue of ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' magazine. <ref>{{cite web| url=http://x-entertainment.com/articles/0751/ | work=[[X-Entertainment]] | title=FX-Entertainment: The 1st Issue of Nintendo Power Magazine! | author=Matt| accessdate=2009-03-10}}</ref> . 

This generation ended with the discontinuation of the NES in 1995.  . 

==1990s==. 
{{listen|filename=Chiptune2.ogg|title=Chiptuned sounds|description=An original synthesized [[chiptune]] composition imitating early video game music.|format=[[Ogg]]}}
{{Main|1990s in video gaming}} . 

The 1990s were a decade of marked [[innovation]] in video gaming. It was a decade of transition from [[raster graphics]] to [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] and gave rise to several genres of video games including  [[first-person shooter]], [[real-time strategy]], and [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMO]]. Handheld gaming began to become more popular throughout the decade, thanks in part to the release of the [[Game Boy]] in 1989. <ref>Nintendo Power Magazine</ref> [[Arcade game]]s, although still relatively popular in the early 1990s, begin a decline as [[Video game console|home console]]s become more common.  . 

The video game industry matured into a mainstream form of entertainment in the 1990s. Major developments of the 1990s included the beginning of a larger consolidation of publishers, higher budget games, increased size of production teams and collaborations with both the music and motion picture industries. Examples of this would be [[Mark Hamill]]'s involvement with [[Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger|Wing Commander III]] or the introduction of [[QSound]].  . 

The increasing computing power and decreasing cost of processors as the [[Intel 80386]], [[Intel i486|Intel 80486]], and the [[Motorola 68030]], caused the rise of [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]], as well as "[[multimedia]]" capabilities through [[sound card]]s and [[CD-ROM]]s. Early 3D games began with [[Flat shading|flat-shaded graphics]] ([[Elite (video game)|Elite]], [[Starglider 2]] or [[Alpha Waves]]<ref>{{cite web| author=Christophe de Dinechin| title=The Dawn of 3D Games | url=http://grenouille-bouillie.blogspot.com/2007/10/dawn-of-3d-games.html | accessdate=2009-09-24| authorlink=Christophe de Dinechin}}</ref>), and then simple forms of texture mapping ([[Wolfenstein 3D]]).  . 

1989 and the early 1990s saw the release and spread of the [[MUD]] codebases [[DikuMUD]] and [[LPMud]], leading to a tremendous increase in the proliferation and popularity of MUDs.  Before the end of the decade, the evolution of the genre continued through "[[graphical MUD]]s" into the first MMORPGs ([[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s), such as ''[[Ultima Online]]'' and ''[[EverQuest]]'', which freed users from the limited number of simultaneous players in other games and brought [[persistent world]]s to the mass market.  A prime example of an MMORPG MUD is the game Runescape created by Jagex.  . 

In the early 1990s, [[shareware]] distribution was a popular method of publishing games for smaller developers, including then-fledgling companies such as Apogee (now [[3D Realms]]), Epic Megagames (now [[Epic Games]]), and [[id Software]]. It gave consumers the chance to try a trial portion of the game, usually restricted to the game’s complete first section or "episode", before purchasing the rest of the adventure. Racks of games on single 5 1/4" and later 3.5" [[floppy disk]]s were common in many stores, often only costing a few dollars each. Since the shareware versions were essentially free, the cost only needed to cover the disk and minimal packaging. As the increasing size of games in the mid-90s made them impractical to fit on floppies, and retail publishers and developers began to earnestly mimic the practice, shareware games were replaced by shorter [[game demo]]s (often only one or two levels), distributed free on CDs with gaming magazines and over the Internet.  . 

In 1991, [[Sonic the Hedgehog (video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] was introduced. The game gave Sega's [[Mega Drive]] console mainstream popularity, and rivaled Nintendo's [[Mario (series)|Mario]] franchise. Its [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|namesake character]] became the mascot of Sega and one of the most recognizable video game characters.  . 

In 1992 the game ''[[Dune II]]'' was released. It was by no means the first in the genre (several other games can be called the very first [[real-time strategy]] game, see the [[Real-time strategy#History|History of RTS]]), but it set the standard game mechanics for later blockbuster RTS games such as ''[[Warcraft: Orcs & Humans]]'', ''[[Command & Conquer]]'', and ''[[StarCraft]]''. The RTS is characterized by an overhead view, a "mini-map", and the control of both the [[economy|economic]] and [[military]] aspects of an army. The rivalry between the two styles of RTS play—''Warcraft'' style, which used [[Graphical user interface|GUI]]s accessed once a building was selected, and ''C&C'' style, which allowed construction of any unit from within a permanently visible menu—continued into the start of the next millennium.  . 

[[Alone in the Dark (video game)|''Alone in the Dark'']] (1992), while not the first [[survival horror]] game, planted the seeds of what would become known as the survival horror genre today. It took the [[Action adventure game|action-adventure]] style and retooled it to de-emphasize combat and focus on investigation. An early attempt to simulate 3D scenarios by mixing polygons with 2D background images, it established the formula that would later flourish on CD-ROM based consoles, with games such as ''[[Resident Evil (video game)|Resident Evil]]'' which coined the name "survival horror" and popularized the genre, and ''[[Silent Hill (video game)|Silent Hill]]''.  . 

Adventure games continued to evolve, with [[Sierra Entertainment]]’s ''[[King's Quest]]'' series, and LucasFilms'/[[LucasArts]]' ''[[Monkey Island (series)|Monkey Island]]'' series bringing graphical interaction and the creation of the concept of "point-and-click" gaming. ''[[Myst]]'' and its sequels inspired a new style of puzzle-based adventure games. Published in 1993, ''Myst'' itself was one of the first computer games to make full use of the new high-capacity [[CD-ROM]] storage format. Despite ''Myst''’s mainstream success, the increased popularity of action-based and real-time games led adventure games and [[simulation video game]]s, both mainstays of computer games in earlier decades, to begin to fade into obscurity.  . 

It was in the 1990s that [[Maxis]] began publishing its successful [[List of Sim games|line of "Sim" games]], beginning with ''[[SimCity]]'', and continuing with a variety of titles, such as ''[[SimEarth]]'', ''[[SimCity 2000]]'', ''[[SimAnt]]'', ''[[SimTower]]'', and the [[List of best-selling video games|best-selling PC game]] in history, ''[[The Sims]]'', in early 2000.  . 

In 1996, [[3dfx Interactive]] released the Voodoo chipset, leading to the first affordable [[Graphics processing unit|3D accelerator card]]s for [[personal computer]]s. These devoted 3D rendering daughter cards performed a portion of the computations required for more-detailed three-dimensional graphics (mainly texture filtering), allowing for more-detailed graphics than would be possible if the CPU were required to handle both game logic and all the graphical tasks. First-person shooter games (notably ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'') were among the first to take advantage of this new technology. While other games would also make use of it, the FPS would become the chief driving force behind the development of new 3D hardware, as well as the yardstick by which its performance would be measured, usually quantified as the number of frames per second rendered for a particular scene in a particular game.  . 

Several other, less-mainstream, genres were created in this decade. [[Looking Glass Studios]]' ''[[Thief: The Dark Project]]'' and its sequel were the first to coin the term "first person sneaker", although it is questionable whether they are the first "first person stealth" games. Turn-based strategy progressed further, with the ''[[Heroes of Might and Magic]]'' (''HOMM'') series (from [[The 3DO Company]]) luring many mainstream gamers into this complex genre.  . 

[[Id Software]]’s 1996 game ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' pioneered play over the Internet in [[first-person shooter]]s. Internet multiplayer capability became a de facto requirement in almost all FPS games. Other genres also began to offer online play, including RTS games like [[Microsoft Game Studios]]’ ''[[Age of Empires]]'', [[Blizzard Entertainment|Blizzard]]’s ''[[Warcraft (series)|Warcraft]]'' and ''[[StarCraft]]'' series, and [[turn-based]] games such as ''Heroes of Might and Magic''. Developments in [[web browser]] [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] like [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Adobe Flash]] allowed for simple [[browser game|browser-based games]]. These are small single player or multiplayer games that can be quickly downloaded and played from within a web browser without installation. Their most popular use is for puzzle games, side-scrollers, classic arcade games, and multiplayer card and board games.  . 

Few new genres have been created since the advent of the FPS and RTS, with the possible exception of the [[third-person shooter]]. Games such as ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'', ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell]]'', ''[[Enter the Matrix]]'', and ''[[Hitman (series)|Hitman]]'' all use a [[virtual camera system|third-person]] camera perspective, but are otherwise very similar to their first-person counterparts.  . 

1998 marked another great advance, which came in the form of [[Descent: FreeSpace – The Great War|Descent: FreeSpace - The Great War]], by Volition Inc. It was one of the better 3D games which was a space flight simulation (Sci-Fi) and it was followed up by [[FreeSpace 2]] in 1999, which had many more graphical updates and even more innovations included.  . 

===Decline of arcades===. 
With the advent of 16-bit and 32-bit consoles, home video games began to approach the level of graphics seen in [[arcade game]]s. An increasing number of players would wait for popular arcade games to be ported to consoles rather than going out. Arcades experienced a resurgence in the early to mid 1990s with games such as ''[[Street Fighter II]]'', ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'', and other games in the one-on-one [[fighting game]] genre, as well as [[racing game]]s such as ''[[Virtua Racing]]'' and [[sports game]]s such as ''[[NBA Jam]]''. As patronage of arcades declined, many were forced to close down. Classic coin-operated games have largely become the province of dedicated hobbyists and as a tertiary attraction for some businesses, such as [[movie theater]]s, [[batting cage]]s, [[miniature golf]], and arcades attached to game stores such as [[Trans World Entertainment|F.Y.E.]] . 

The gap left by the old corner arcades was partly filled by large amusement centers dedicated to providing clean, safe environments and expensive game control systems not available to home users. These are usually based on sports like skiing or cycling, as well as [[rhythm game]]s like ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'', which have carved out a large slice of the market. [[Dave & Buster's]] and [[GameWorks]] are two large chains in the United States with this type of environment. Aimed at adults and older kids, they feature full service restaurants with full liquor bars and have a wide variety of video game and hands on electronic gaming options. [[Chuck E. Cheese's]] is a similar type of establishment focused towards small children.  . 

===Handhelds come of age===. 
In 1989, Nintendo released the [[Game Boy]], the first [[handheld game console|handheld console]] since the ill-fated [[Microvision]] ten years before. The design team headed by [[Gunpei Yokoi]] had also been responsible for the [[Game & Watch]] systems. Included with the system was ''[[Tetris]]'', a popular puzzle game. Several rival handhelds also made their debut around that time, including the [[Sega Game Gear]] and [[Atari Lynx]] (the first handheld with color LCD display). Although most other systems were more technologically advanced, they were hampered by higher battery consumption and less third-party developer support. While some of the other systems remained in production until the mid-90s, the Game Boy remained at the top spot in sales throughout its lifespan.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} . 

===Fourth generation consoles (1989–1999) (16-bit)===. 
{{Main|History of video game consoles (fourth generation)}} . 

The [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] proved its worth early on after its debut in 1989. Nintendo responded with its own next generation system known as the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] (SNES) in 1991. The [[TurboGrafx-16]] debuted early on alongside the Genesis, but did not achieve a large following in the U.S. due to a limited library of games and excessive distribution restrictions imposed by Hudson. 
[[File:Mortal Kombat.png|thumb|left|200px|[[Mortal Kombat (video game)|Mortal Kombat]], released in both SNES and Genesis consoles, was one of the most popular game franchises of its time.]] . 

The intense competition of this time was also a period of not entirely truthful marketing. The TurboGrafx-16 was billed as the first 16-bit system but its central processor was an 8-bit [[Hudson Soft HuC6280|HuC6280]], with only its [[Hudson Soft HuC6270|HuC6270]] graphics processor being a true 16-bit chip.  Additionally, the much earlier Mattel [[Intellivision]] contained a 16-bit processor. Sega, too, was known to stretch the truth in its marketing approach; they used the term "Blast Processing" to describe the simple fact that their console's CPU ran at a higher clock speed than that of the SNES (7.67 [[Hertz|MHz]] vs 3.58&nbsp;MHz).  . 

In Japan, the 1987 success of the PC Engine (as the TurboGrafx-16 was known there) against the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] and [[Compact Disc|CD]] drive peripheral allowed it to fend off the Mega Drive (Genesis) in 1988, which never really caught on to the same degree as outside Japan. The PC Engine eventually lost out to the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]], but, due to its popular CD add-ons, retained enough of a user base to support new games well into the late 1990s.  . 

CD-ROM drives were first seen in this generation, as add-ons for the PC Engine in 1988 and the Mega Drive in 1991. Basic [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] entered the mainstream with flat-shaded polygons enabled by additional processors in game cartridges like ''[[Virtua Racing]]'' and ''[[Star Fox (series)|Star Fox]]''.  . 

[[SNK Playmore|SNK]]'s [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo-Geo]] was the most expensive console by a wide margin when it was released in 1990, and would remain so for years. It was also capable of 2D graphics in a quality level years ahead of other consoles. The reason for this was that it contained the same hardware that was found in SNK's arcade games. This was the first time since the home Pong machines that a true-to-the-arcade experience could be had at home.  . 

This generation ended with the SNES's discontinuation in 1999.  . 

===Fifth generation consoles (1993–2006) (32 and 64-bit)===. 
{{Main|History of video game consoles (fifth generation)}} . 

In 1993, Atari re-entered the home console market with the introduction of the [[Atari Jaguar]]. Also in 1993, [[The 3DO Company]] released the [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]], which, though highly advertised and promoted, failed to catch up to the sales of the Jaguar, due its high pricetag. Both consoles had very low sales and few quality games, eventually leading to their demise. In 1994, three new consoles were released in Japan: the [[Sega Saturn]], the [[PlayStation]], and the [[PC-FX]], the Saturn and the PlayStation later seeing release in North America in 1995. The PlayStation quickly outsold all of its competitors, with the exception of the aging [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], which still had the support of many major game companies.  . 

The [[Virtual Boy]] from Nintendo was released in 1995 but did not achieve high sales. In 1996 the Virtual Boy was taken off the market.  . 

After many delays, Nintendo released its [[64-bit]] console, the [[Nintendo 64]] in 1996. The console's flagship title, ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', became a defining title for 3D platformer games.  . 

''[[PaRappa the Rapper]]'' popularized [[rhythm game|rhythm]], or [[music video game]]s in Japan with its 1996 debut on the [[PlayStation]]. Subsequent music and dance games like ''[[beatmania]]'' and ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' became ubiquitous attractions in Japanese arcades. While ''Parappa'', ''DDR'', and other games found a cult following when brought to North America, music games would not gain a wide audience in the market until the next decade. Also in 1996 [[Capcom]] released [[Resident Evil]], the first well known survival horror game. It was a huge success selling over 2 million copies and is considered one of the best games on the Playstation.  . 

Other milestone games of the era include [[Rare Ltd.|Rare]]'s Nintendo 64 title ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'' (1997), which was critically acclaimed for bringing innovation as being the first major first-person shooter that was exclusive to a console, and for pioneering certain features that became staples of the genre, such as scopes, headshots, and objective-based missions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'' (1998) for the Nintendo 64 is widely considered the highest critically acclaimed game of all time. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/browse.html |title=GameRankings: All Time Best |accessdate=2009-07-15}}</ref> The title also featured many innovations such as [[Z-targeting]] which is commonly used in many games today.  . 

Nintendo's choice to use cartridges instead of CD-ROMs for the Nintendo 64, unique among the consoles of this period, proved to have negative consequences. While cartridges were faster and combated piracy, CDs could hold far more data and were much cheaper to produce, causing many game companies to turn to Nintendo's CD-based competitors. In particular, [[Square (company)|Square]], which had released all previous games in its ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series for Nintendo consoles, now turned to the PlayStation; ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' (1997) was a huge success, establishing the popularity of [[role-playing video game]]s in the west and making the PlayStation the primary console for the genre.  . 

By the end of this period, Sony had become the leader in the video game market. The Saturn was moderately successful in Japan but a commercial failure in North America and Europe, leaving Sega outside of the main competition. The N64 achieved huge success in North America and Europe, though it never surpassed PlayStation's sales or was as popular in Japan.  . 

This generation ended with the PlayStation discontinuation in March 2006.  . 

====Transition to 3D and CDs====. 
The fifth generation is most noted for the rise of fully [[3D computer graphics|3D]] games. While there were games prior that had used three dimensional environments, such as ''[[Virtua Racing]]'' and [[Star Fox (SNES)|''Star Fox'']], it was in this era that many game designers began to move traditionally [[2D computer graphics|2D]] and [[2.5D|pseudo-3D]] genres into full 3D. ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' on the N64, ''[[Crash Bandicoot (video game)|Crash Bandicoot]]'' on the PlayStation and ''[[Nights into Dreams]]'' on the Saturn, are prime examples of this trend. Their 3D environments were widely marketed and they steered the industry's focus away from side-scrolling and rail-style titles, as well as opening doors to more complex games and genres. Games like ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'', ''[[The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'' or ''[[Virtua Fighter (series)|Virtua Fighter]]'' were nothing like shoot-em-ups, RPG's or fighting games before them. 3D became the main focus in this era as well as a slow decline of cartridges in favor of [[Compact Disc|CDs]].  . 

===Mobile phone gaming===. 
{{main|Mobile game}} . 

Mobile phones began becoming videogaming platforms when [[Nokia]] installed ''[[Snake (video game)|Snake]]'' onto its line of mobile phones in 1998. Soon every major phone brand offered "time killer games" that could be played in very short moments such as waiting for a bus. [[Mobile game|Mobile phone games]] early on were limited by the modest size of the phone screens that were all monochrome and the very limited amount of memory and processing power on phones, as well as the drain on the battery.  . 

==2000s==. 
{{Cleanup-laundry|date=January 2008}}
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2007}}
{{Main|2000s in video gaming}} . 

The first decade of the 2000s showed innovation on both consoles and PCs, and an increasingly competitive market for portable game systems.  . 

The phenomena of user-created [[mod (computer gaming)|modifications]] (or "mods") for games, one trend that began during the [[Wolfenstein 3D]] and [[Doom (video game)|Doom]]-era, continued into the turn of the millennium. The most famous example is that of ''[[Counter-Strike]]''; released in 1999, it is still the most popular online first-person shooter, even though it was created as a mod for ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' by two independent programmers.  Eventually, game designers realized the potential of mods and custom content in general to enhance the value of their games, and so began to encourage its creation. Some examples of this include ''[[Unreal Tournament]]'', which allowed players to import 3dsmax scenes to use as character models, and [[Maxis]]' ''[[The Sims]]'', for which players could create custom objects.  . 

===Sixth generation consoles (1998–2010)===. 
{{Main|History of video game consoles (sixth generation)}} . 

In the sixth generation of video game consoles, Sega exited the hardware market, Nintendo fell behind, Sony solidified its lead in the industry, and Microsoft developed a gaming console.  . 

The generation opened with the launch of the [[Dreamcast]] in 1998. It was the first console to have a built-in modem for Internet support and online play. While it was initially successful, sales and popularity would soon begin to decline with contributing factors being Sega's damaged reputation from previous commercial failures, software pirating, and the overwhelming anticipation for the upcoming [[Playstation 2]]. Production for the console would discontinue in most markets by 2002 and would be Sega's final console before becoming a third party game provider only.  . 

The second release of the generation was Sony's Playstation 2. Nintendo followed a year later with the [[Nintendo GameCube]], their first disc-based console. The Nintendo GameCube suffered from a lack of third-party games compared to Sony's system, and was hindered by a reputation for being a "kid's console" and lacking the mature games the current market appeared to want.  . 

[[File:Xbox-console.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Xbox]], Microsoft's entry into the video game console industry.]]Before the end of 2001, Microsoft Corporation, best known for its [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system and its professional productivity software, entered the console market with the [[Xbox]]. Based on Intel's Pentium III CPU, the console used much PC technology to leverage its internal development. In order to maintain its hold in the market, Microsoft reportedly sold the Xbox at a significant loss<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2005/09/26/forbes-xbox-lost-microsoft-4-billion-and-counting/|title=Forbes: Xbox lost Microsoft $4 billion (and counting)|accessdate=2007-07-18|author=Cole, Vladimir|date=2005-09-26|publisher=Joystiq}}</ref> and concentrated on drawing profit from game development and publishing. Shortly after its release in November 2001 [[Bungie|Bungie Studio's]] ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' instantly became the driving point of the Xbox's success, and the [[Halo (series)|Halo series]] would later go on to become one of the most successful console shooters of all time. By the end of the generation, the Xbox had drawn even with the Nintendo GameCube in sales globally, but since nearly all of its sales were in North America, it pushed Nintendo into third place in the American market.  . 

In 2001 ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'' was released, popularizing open world games by using a non-linear style of gameplay. It was very successful both critically and commercially and is considered a huge milestone in gaming.  . 

Nintendo still dominated the handheld gaming market in this generation. The [[Game Boy Advance]] in 2001, maintained Nintendo's market position. Finnish cellphone maker Nokia entered the handheld scene with the [[N-Gage]], but it failed to win a significant following.  . 

Console gaming largely continued the trend established by the PlayStation toward increasingly complex, sophisticated, and adult-oriented gameplay. Most of the successful sixth-generation console games were games rated T and M by the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]], including many now-classic gaming franchises such as Halo and Resident Evil, the latter of which was notable for both its success and its notoriety. Even Nintendo, widely known for its aversion to adult content (with very few exceptions most notably ''[[Conker's Bad Fur Day]]'' for the [[Nintendo 64]]), began publishing more M-rated games, with Silicon Knights's ''[[Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem]]'' and Capcom's ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' being prime examples. This trend in hardcore console gaming would partially be reversed with the seventh generation release of the [[Wii]]. As of 2011, the PlayStation 2 was still in production and continued to sell steadily over a decade after its original release. <ref name="gamertell.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamertell.com/technologytell/article/ps2-turns-nine-sony-says-systems-life-cycle-will-continue/ |title=PS2 turns nine, Sony says system’s "life cycle will continue" |publisher=Gamertell.com |accessdate=November 11, 2010|author=PJ Hruschak |date=October 28, 2009}}</ref> . 

====Return of alternate controllers====. 
One significant feature of this generation was various manufacturers' renewed fondness for add-on peripheral controllers. While alternate controllers weren't new, as Nintendo featured several with the original NES and PC gaming has previously featured driving wheels and aircraft joysticks, for the first time console games using them became some of the biggest hits of the decade. Konami introduced a soft plastic mat versions of its foot controls for its ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' franchise in 1998. Sega's alternate peripherals included [[Samba De Amigo]]'s maraca controllers. Nintendo introduced a [[DK Bongos|bongo controller]] for a few titles in its [[Donkey Kong (series)|''Donkey Kong'' franchise]]. Publisher [[RedOctane]] introduced ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' and its distinctive guitar-shaped controllers for the PlayStation 2. Meanwhile, Sony introduced the [[EyeToy]] peripheral, a camera that could detect player movement, for the PlayStation 2.  . 

===Online gaming rises to prominence===. 
As affordable broadband Internet connectivity spread, many publishers turned to online gaming as a way of innovating. [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (MMORPGs) featured significant titles for the PC market like ''[[EverQuest]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', and ''[[Ultima Online]]''. Historically, console based MMORPGs have been few in number due to the lack of bundled Internet connectivity options for the platforms. This made it hard to establish a large enough subscription community to justify the development costs. The first significant console MMORPGs were ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]'' on the Sega [[Dreamcast]] (which had a built in modem and after market Ethernet adapter), followed by ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'' for the Sony [[PlayStation 2]] (an aftermarket Ethernet adapter was shipped to support this game). Every major platform released since the Dreamcast has either been bundled with the ability to support an Internet connection or has had the option available as an aftermarket add-on.  Microsoft's Xbox also had its own online gaming service called [[Xbox Live]].  Xbox Live was a huge success and proved to be a driving force for the Xbox with games like ''[[Halo 2]]'' that were overwhelmingly popular.  . 

===Mobile games===. 
{{main|Mobile game}} . 

In the early 2000s, mobile games had gained mainstream popularity in [[Japanese mobile phone culture|Japan's mobile phone culture]], years before the United States or Europe. By 2003, a wide variety of mobile games were available on Japanese phones, ranging from [[puzzle game]]s and [[virtual pet]] titles that utilize [[camera phone]] and [[Fingerprint recognition|fingerprint scanner]] technologies to [[3D computer graphics|3D]] games with [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]-quality graphics. Older [[Arcade game|arcade-style games]] became particularly popular on mobile phones, which were an ideal platform for arcade-style games designed for shorter play sessions. Namco began making attempts to introduce mobile gaming culture to Europe in 2003. <ref name="bbc_mobile">{{cite news|last=Hermida|first=Alfred|title=Japan leads mobile game craze|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3186345.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=22 September 2011|date=28 August 2003}}</ref> . 

Mobile gaming interest was raised when Nokia launched its [[N-Gage]] phone and handheld gaming platform in 2003. While about two million handsets were sold, the product line wasn't seen as a success and withdrawn from Nokia's lineup. Meanwhile, many game developers had noticed that more advanced phones had color screens and reasonable memory and processing power to do reasonable gaming. Mobile phone gaming revenues passed 1 billion dollars in 2003, and passed 5 billion dollars in 2007, accounting for a quarter of all videogaming software revenues. More advanced phones came to the market such as the N-Series [[smartphone]] by Nokia in 2005 and the [[iPhone]] by Apple in 2007 which strongly added to the appeal of mobile phone gaming. In 2008 Nokia didn't revise the N-Gage brand, but only published a software library of games to its top-end phones. At Apple's App Store in 2008, more than half of all applications sold were iPhone games.  . 

===Seventh generation consoles (2004–present)===. 
{{Main|History of video game consoles (seventh generation)}} . 

The generation opened early for handheld consoles, as Nintendo introduced their [[Nintendo DS]] and Sony premiered the [[PlayStation Portable]] (PSP) within a month of each other in 2004. While the PSP boasted superior graphics and power, following a trend established since the mid 1980s, Nintendo gambled on a lower-power design but featuring a novel control interface. The DS's two screens, one of which was touch-sensitive, proved extremely popular with consumers, especially young children and middle-aged gamers, who were drawn to the device by Nintendo's ''[[Nintendogs]]'' and ''[[Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!|Brain Age]]'' series, respectively. While the PSP attracted a significant portion of veteran gamers, the DS allowed Nintendo to continue its dominance in handheld gaming. Nintendo updated their line with the [[Nintendo DS Lite]] in 2006, the [[Nintendo DSi]] in 2008 (Japan) and 2009 (Americas and Europe), and the [[Nintendo DSi XL]] while Sony updated the PSP in 2007 and again with the smaller [[PSP Go]] in 2009. Nokia withdrew their [[N-Gage]] platform in 2005 but reintroduced the brand as a game-oriented service for high-end smartphones on April 3, 2008. <ref name="launch">{{cite web|url=http://www.n-gage.com/ngi/ngage/web/g0/en/community/articles.Detail.general-anewdayforngage.1.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091125060728/http://www.n-gage.com/ngi/ngage/web/g0/en/community/articles.Detail.general-anewdayforngage.1.html|archivedate=2009-11-25 |title= A New Day for N-Gage |publisher=Nokia |accessdate=2008-04-03}}</ref> . 

In console gaming, Microsoft stepped forward first in November 2005 with the [[Xbox 360]], and Sony followed in 2006 with the [[PlayStation 3]], released in Europe in March 2007. Setting the technology standard for the generation, both featured high-definition graphics, large hard disk-based secondary storage, integrated networking, and a companion on-line gameplay and sales platform, with Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network, respectively. Both were formidable systems that were the first to challenge personal computers in power (at  launch) while offering a relatively modest price compared to them. While both were more expensive than most past consoles, the Xbox 360 enjoyed a substantial price edge, selling for either $300 or $400 depending on model, while the PS3 launched with models priced at $500 and $600. Coming with [[Blu-ray]] and [[Wi-Fi]], the PlayStation 3 was the most expensive game console on the market since Panasonic's version of the 3DO, which retailed for little under $700. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://most-expensive.net/video-game-console-system |title=The Most Expensive Video game Consoles |author=Most Expensive Journal |accessdate=2009-09-29}}</ref> . 

Nintendo would release their [[Wii]] console shortly after the PlayStation 3's launch, and the platform would put Nintendo back on track in the console race. While the Wii had lower technical specifications (and a lower price) than both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.wii.ign.com/articles/733/733464p7.html |title=Nintendo Wii FAQ |author=Casamassina, Matt |accessdate=2009-09-29}}</ref> its new motion control was much touted. Many gamers, publishers, and analysts initially dismissed the Wii as an underpowered curiosity, but were surprised as the console sold out through the 2006 Christmas season, and remained so through the next 18 months, becoming the fastest selling game console in most of the world's gaming markets. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2009/06/12/nintendo-wii-sets-record-as-fastest-selling-console-in-the-us/ |title=Wii becomes fastest selling console in the United States |author=Melanson, Donald |accessdate=2009-09-29}}</ref> . 

In June 2009, Sony announced that it would release its [[PSP Go]] for 249.99USD on October 1 in Europe and North America, and Japan on November 1. The PSP Go was a newer, slimmer version of the PSP, which had the control pad slide from the base, where its screen covers most of the front side. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5275971/psp-go-is-officially-249 |title=PSP Go is Officially 249USD |author=Plunkett, Luke |accessdate=2009-09-29}}</ref> . 

====Increases in development budgets====. 
With high definition video an undeniable hit with veteran gamers seeking immersive experiences, expectations for visuals in games along with the increasing complexity of productions resulted in a spike in the development budgets of gaming companies. While many game studios saw their Xbox 360 projects pay off, the unexpected weakness of PS3 sales resulted in heavy losses for some developers, and many publishers broke previously arranged PS3 exclusivity arrangements or cancelled PS3 game projects entirely in order to cut losses.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} . 

====Nintendo capitalizes on casual gaming====. 
Meanwhile, Nintendo took cues from PC gaming and their own success with the Nintendo Wii, and crafted games that capitalized on the intuitive nature of motion control. Emphasis on gameplay turned comparatively simple games into unlikely runaway hits, including the bundled game, ''[[Wii Sports]]'', and ''[[Wii Fit]]''. As the Wii sales spiked, many publishers were caught unprepared and responded by assembling hastily created titles to fill the void. Although some hardcore games continued to be produced by Nintendo, many of their classic franchises were reworked into "bridge games", meant to provide new gamers crossover experiences from casual gaming to deeper experiences, including their flagship Wii title, ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', which in spite of its standard-resolution graphics dominated critics' "best-of" lists for 2007. Many others, however, strongly criticized Nintendo for its apparent spurning of its core gamer base in favor of a demographic many warned would be fickle and difficult to keep engaged.  . 

====Motion control revolutionizes game play====. 
The way gamers interact with games changed dramatically, especially with Nintendo's wholesale embrace of motion control as a standard method of interaction. The [[Wii Remote]] implemented the principles to be a worldwide success. To a lesser extent, Sony experimented with motion in its [[Sixaxes|Sixaxis]] and subsequent [[DualShock 3]] controller for the PS3, and a wave of titles supporting the [[PlayStation Eye]], while Microsoft continually mentioned interest in developing the technology for the Xbox 360, such as [[Project Natal]]. While the Wii's infrared-based pointing system has been widely praised, and cited as a primary reason for the success of games such as Nintendo's ''[[Metroid Prime 3: Corruption]]'' and EA's ''[[Medal of Honor: Heroes 2]]''. Despite the success of these titles, reliable motion controls have been more elusive, with even the most refined motion controls failing to achieve true 1-to-1 reproduction of player motion on-screen. Some players have even found that they must move slower than they would like or the Wii will not register their movements, but this is rare. Nintendo's 2008 announcement of its [[Wii MotionPlus]] module intends to address these concerns.  . 

Alternate controllers also continue to be important in gaming, as the increasingly involved controllers associated with Red Octane's ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' series and Harmonix's ''[[Rock Band]]'' demonstrate.  In addition to this, Nintendo has produced various add-on attachments meant to adapt the Wii Remote to specific games, such as the [[Wii Zapper]] for shooting games and the [[Wii Wheel]] for driving games. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2007/07/11/nintendo-packing-wii-wheel-with-mario-kart-for-wii/ |title=Nintendo Packing Wii Wheel with Mario Kart Wii |author=Miller, P. |accessdate=2009-07-13}}</ref> With the introduction of the Balance Board in Nintendo's ''[[Wii Fit]]'' package, motion controls have been extended to players' feet. Third party efforts from THQ, EA, and other publishers that integrate Nintendo's Balance Board are expected in 2009.  . 

At [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009]], [[Microsoft]] and [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] each presented their own new motion controllers: [[Project Natal]] (later renamed ''Kinect'') and [[PlayStation Move]], respectively. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/kit-eaton/technomix/sony-microsoft-motion-controls-will-beat-wii-its-own-game |title=Sony, Microsoft Motion Controls will beat Wii at its own game |author=Eaton, K. |accessdate=2009-07-13}}</ref> . 

On September 17, 2010, [[Sony]] released [[PlayStation Move]], which uses the [[PlayStation Eye]] camera to track the motion of a wand controller, [[PlayStation Move]] has sold 8.8 million as of E3 2011. <ref>[http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-06-07-move-sales-top-8-8m Move sales top 8.8m News - PlayStation 3 - Page 1 | Eurogamer.net<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . 

===Rise of casual PC games===. 
{{see also|Casual game|Social network game}} . 

Beginning with PCs, a new trend in [[casual game|casual gaming]], games with limited complexity that were designed for shortened or impromptu play sessions, began to draw attention from the industry.  Many were puzzle games, such as [[Popcap]]'s ''[[Bejeweled]]'' and [[PlayFirst]]'s ''[[Diner Dash]]'', while others were games with a more relaxed pace and open-ended play. The biggest hit was ''[[The Sims]]'' by [[Maxis]], which went on to become the best selling computer game of all time, surpassing ''[[Myst]]''. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/simslivinlarge/news_2857556.html |title=The Sims overtakes Myst |accessdate=2008-03-15 |author=Walker, Trey |date=2002-03-22 |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CNET Networks]]}}</ref> . 

Other casual games include ''[[Happy Farm]]'' and [[Zynga]] games like ''[[Mafia Wars]]'', ''[[FarmVille]]'', and ''Cafe World'', among many others, which are tied into [[social networking]] sites such as [[Myspace]], [[Facebook]], and [[Mixi]].  These games are offered freely with the option buy in game items, and stats for money and/or reward offers.  . 

In 2008, [[social network game]]s began gaining mainstream popularity following the release of ''[[Happy Farm]]'' in China. <ref name="wired_influential14">{{cite web|last=Kohler|first=Chris|title=14.

===Cloud Computing comes to games===. 
In 2009, a few [[cloud computing]] services were announced targeted at video games. These services allow the graphics rendering of the video games to be done away from the end user, and a video stream of the game to be passed to the user. [[OnLive]] allows the user to communicate with their servers where the video game rendering is taking place. <ref name="OnLive_FAQ">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlive.com/service/faq.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100127090944/http://www.onlive.com/service/faq.html|archivedate=2010-01-27 |title=FAQ |publisher=OnLive |date= |accessdate=2009-07-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Kelly |first=Kevin |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/03/24/gdc09-rearden-studios-introduces-onlive-game-service-and-micro/ |title=GDC09: Rearden Studios introduces OnLive game service and 'microconsole' |publisher=Joystiq.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-25}}</ref> [[Gaikai]] streams games entirely in the user's browser or on an internet-enabled device. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/wow-streamed-to-ipad-makes-fans-all-excited-0384076/|title=WoW streamed to iPad gets fans excited|accessdate=2011-05-26}}</ref> . 

==2010s==. 
{{Main|2010s in video gaming}} . 

The new decade has seen rising interest in the possibility of next generation consoles being developed in keeping with the traditional industry model of a five-year console lifecycle.  However, in the industry there is believed to be a lack of desire for another race to produce such a console. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2010/feb/26/games-microsoft|title=Natal vs Sony Motion Controller: is the console cycle over?|author=Stuart, K.|accessdate=2010-05-13|location=London|work=The Guardian|date=2010-02-26}}</ref> Reasons for this include the challenge and massive expense of creating consoles that are graphically superior to the current generation, with Sony and Microsoft still looking to recoup development costs on its current consoles and the failure for content-creation tools to keep up with the increased demands placed upon the people creating the resources such as art for the games on those consoles. The focus for new technologies is likely to shift onto motion-based consoles and peripherals, such as Nintendo [[Wii]], Microsoft's [[Kinect]], and Sony's [[PlayStation Move]].  . 

On June 14, 2010, during E3, Microsoft revealed their new Xbox 360 console referred to as the Xbox 360 S or Slim.  Microsoft's made the unit smaller and quieter, while also installing a 250GB hard drive and built-in 802.11n WiFi. <ref name="Slim Specs">{{cite web|last=Totilo|first=Stephen|title=These Are The New Xbox 360 Specs|url=http://kotaku.com/5563225/new-xbox-360-specs|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref>  It starting shipping to US stores the same day, not reaching Europe until July 13. The Onlive cloud based gaming system would be one of the first cloud gaming systems known in video game history.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} . 

===Gaming without controllers=== . 

On November 27, 2010, [[Microsoft]] released [[Kinect]] as a peripheral for the Xbox 360; it was packaged with the console as well. It uses a sensor and dual-camera device to track the motion of the players themselves, becoming the first motion control system capable of tracking the player in 3D space without the need for a controller. It sold an average of 133,333 units a day for the first 60 days and a total of 6 million units during the same period, earning it the [[Guinness World Record]] for the "fastest selling consumer electronics device". <ref name="Gamasutra-record">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/33430/Microsoft_Kinect_Hits_10_Million_Units_10_Million_Games.php|title=Microsoft: Kinect Hits 10 Million Units, 10 Million Games|author=Leigh Alexander|publisher=Gamasutra|date={{date|2011-03-09|mdy}}|accessdate={{date|2011-03-10|mdy}}}}</ref><ref name="CVG-record">{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/292825/kinect-cruises-past-10m-sales-barrier/|title=Kinect cruises past 10m sales barrier |author=Tim Ingham|publisher=CVG|date={{date|2011-03-09|mdy}}|accessdate={{date|2011-03-10|mdy}}}}</ref><ref name="Guinness-record">{{cite web |url=http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com/_Kinect-Confirmed-As-Fastest-Selling-Consumer-Electronics-Device/blog/3376939/7691.html|title=Kinect Confirmed As Fastest-Selling Consumer Electronics Device|publisher=Guinnessworldrecords.com|accessdate={{date|2011-03-10|mdy}}}}</ref> Sales passed 10 million units as of March 9, 2011. <ref name="10-million">{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2011/03/09/microsoft-sells-10-million-kinects-10-million-kinect-games/|title=Microsoft sells 10 million Kinects, 10 million Kinect games|author=Tim Stevens|publisher=[[Engadget]]|date={{Date|2011-03-09|mdy}}|accessdate={{Date|2011-03-10|mdy}}}}</ref> .
