{{Video games}} . 

'''Controversies over video games''' often center on topics such as video game [[graphic violence]], sex and sexism, violent and gory scenes, partial or full nudity, portrayal of [[Crime|criminal behavior]], racism, and other provocative and objectionable material.  . 

Video games have been studied for links to [[video game addiction|addiction]] and [[aggression]]. Earlier [[meta-analyses]] (an analysis of several studies) were conflicting. A 2001 study found that exposure to violent video games causes at least a temporary increase in aggression and that this exposure correlates with aggression in the real world. A decrease in [[prosocial behavior]] (caring about the welfare and rights of others) was also noted. <ref name="Effects on aggressive behaviour">Anderson, C.A., & Bushman, B.J. (2001).

Effects The effects of violent video games on aggression: A meta-analysis.

C. J., & Kilburn, J. (2009). The Public health risks of media violence: A meta-analytic review. ''Journal of Pediatrics'', 154, 759-763<br></ref> concluded that video game violence is not related to serious aggressive behavior in real life.  . 

Many potential positive effects have been proposed. <ref name="wonderful things">{{cite news|last=Radoff|first=Jon|title=Six Wonderful Things about Games|date=2009-12-08|url=http://radoff.com/blog/2009/12/08/six-wonderful-things-about-games/|accessdate=2009-12-19}}</ref> Recent research has suggested that some violent video games may actually have a prosocial effect in some contexts, for example, team play. <ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VDC-51J17HB-1&_user=10&_coverDate=11%2F23%2F2010&_rdoc=26&_fmt=high&_orig=browse&_origin=browse&_zone=rslt_list_item&_srch=doc-info(%23toc%235979%239999%23999999999%2399999%23FLA%23display%23Articles)&_cdi=5979&_sort=d&_docanchor=&_ct=80&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=1ffde466509794d657f9098063c588d1&searchtype=a|title=Call of (civic) duty: Action games and civic behavior in a large sample of youth | first = Christopher| last = Ferguson| coauthors = Adolfo Garza |journal = Computers in Human Behavior| accessdate=January 1, 2010| doi=10.1016/j.chb.2010.10.026|year=2011|volume=27|issue=2|pages=770–775}}</ref> . 

It has been argued there is generally a lack of quality studies which can be relied upon and that the video game industry has become an easy target for the media to blame for many modern day problems. <ref>"Video Violence: Villain or Victim?", Guy Cumberbatch, London Video Standards Council, 2004</ref><ref>"It's Not the Media", Karen Sternheimer, Westview, 2003</ref><ref>{{cite news|last = Benedetti|first=Winda|title=Why search our souls when video games make such an easy scapegoat?|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date = 2008-02-18|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23204875/|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref> The most recent large scale meta-anlysis-- examining 130 studies with over 130,000 subjects worldwide-- concluded that exposure to violent video games causes both short term and long term aggression in players and decreases empathy and prosocial behavior.  However, this meta-analysis was severely criticized in the same issue of the same journal for a number of methodological flaws, including failure to distinguish clinically valid from unstandardized aggression measures and for failing to solicit studies from researchers who have questioned whether causal links exist, thus biasing the sample of included studies. <ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Much%20Ado.pdf|title=Much Ado About Nothing: The Misestimation and Overinterpretation of Violent Video Game Effects in Eastern and Western Nations: Comment on Anderson et al.

== Demographics ==. 
=== Age ===. 
The Entertainment Software Association states that 20% of video game players are boys under the age of 17, 26% are over 50 (regardless of gender), and that the average game player is 37. <ref name="ESAFacts">Entertainment Software Association. (2009). [http://www.theesa.com/facts/ Industry Facts]. Washington, DC: Entertainment Software Association. </ref>
In a survey of 1,102 teenagers aged 12 to 17, 97% of them said that they play video games; moreover, half of the survey respondents said that they had played a video game in the last day. Three-quarters of parents who were surveyed said that they check the ratings on their kid's games. However, half of the boys who were asked about their favorite game listed a game with an “M” or “AO” rating as their favorite, compared with 14% of girls. <ref>{{cite news|last=Irvine|first=Martha|title=Survey: 97% of Children play Video Games|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/16/survey-97-percent-of-chil_n_126948.html|work=Huffington Post|date=2008-09-16}}</ref>
The adult demographic is the fastest-growing segment of the American video games market with 32% of adults playing video games,<ref name="Gentile2007">{{cite journal | last1 = Gentile | first1 = D. | last2 = Saleem | first2 = M. | last3 = Anderson | first3 = C. | year = 2007 | title = Public Policy and the Effects of Media Violence on Children | url = | journal = Social Issues and Policy Review | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 15–61 | doi = 10.1111/j.1751-2409.2007.00003.x }}</ref> although critics have suggested that such statistics are often used to deflect from the fact that almost all American children are exposed to video games. <ref name="Gentile2007" /> . 

===Gender===. 
As of 2011, over 40% of players are female. <ref name="ESAFacts" /> However, a 1998 study conducted at the University of Central Florida found that of the 33 games sampled, 41% do not feature female characters, 28% portrayed women as sex objects, 21% depicted violence against women, and 30% did not represent the female population at all. Furthermore, characterizations of women tended to be stereotypical: highly sexualized ("visions of beauty with large breasts and hips"), dependent ("victim or as the proverbial 'Damsel in Distress'"), opposed ("evil or as obstacles to the goal of the game"), and trivial ("females depicted [...] in fairly non-significant roles"). <ref name="Dietz1998">Dietz, T.

==Controversial topics==. 
===Crime and violence===. 
One of the most common criticisms of video games is that they increase the violent tendencies among youth. <ref name="Effects on aggressive behaviour"/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Funk | first1 = Hagan | last2 = Schimming | first2 = Bullock | last3 = Buchman | first3 =  Jackie| last4 = Myers | first4 =  Wesley A.| year = 2002 | title = Aggression and psychopathology in adolescents with a preference for violent electronic games | url = | journal = Aggressive Behavior | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 134–144 | doi = 10.1002/ab.90015 | last5 = Buchman | first5 = Debra D. | last6 = Myers | first6 = Melissa }}</ref><ref>Gentile, D.

Westport, CT: Praeger Publishing</ref> However, several major studies by groups such as [[Harvard Medical School|The Harvard Medical School Center for Mental Health]], ''[[The Journal of Adolescent Health]]'', and ''[[BMJ|The British Medical Journal]]'' have shown no conclusive link between video game usage and violent activity."<ref name="Childhood">Grand Theft Childhood: The Surprising Truth About Violent Video Games, Lawrence Kutner PhD and Cheryl K.

The game caused such an outcry that it was pulled from store shelves and profiled on ''[[60 Minutes]]''. [[Long Island]] [[Parent-Teacher Association|PTA]] president [[Ronnie Lamm]] pushed for legislation in the early 1980s to place restrictions on how close video game arcades could be to schools, asserting that they caused children to fight. <ref name="gamespot-twotribes-introduction">{{cite web|author=Gonzalez, Lauren|date = |url = http://www.gamespot.com/features/6090892/index.html|title=When Two Tribes Go to War: A History of Video Game Controversy|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2008-08-03}}</ref> Portrayals of violence allegedly became more realistic with time, and so politicians such as U.S. Senator [[Joe Lieberman]] conducted hearings during the 1990s regarding what he referred to as "violent video games" which, in his opinion, included such games as ''[[Mortal Kombat (video game)|Mortal Kombat]]''. His sentiments have been echoed by certain researchers, such as [[Craig A. Anderson|Dr. Craig A. Anderson]] who testified before the Senate, "Some studies have yielded nonsignificant video game effects, just as some smoking studies failed to find a significant link to lung cancer. But when one combines all relevant empirical studies using meta-analytic techniques it shows that violent video games are significantly associated with: increased aggressive behavior, thoughts, and affect; increased physiological arousal; and decreased pro-social (helping) behavior."<ref name="Anderson questions">{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Craig|title=Violent Video Games: Myths, Facts, and Unanswered Questions|publisher=apa.org|month =October|year=2003|url=http://www.apa.org/science/psa/sb-anderson.html}}</ref><ref>Horn, V.

[[File:JackThompsonAttorney.jpg|thumb|Disbarred attorney [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] has filed lawsuits against the makers of violent games, alleging the simulated violence causes real-world violence.]]
''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'' is an example of a video game that caused controversy, over and above the debate surrounding the violent gameplay, for allegedly encouraging [[racism|racist]] [[hate crime]]s. The game takes place in "Vice City", a fictionalized [[Miami]], in 1986, and involves a gang war between [[Haiti]]ans and [[Cuba]]n refugees, with the player's character getting involved and encouraging the inter-ethnic violence. For example, in a shoot-out with the Haitian gang, the player's character uses phrases such as "kill the Haitian dickheads", which highly incensed both Haitian and Cuban anti-defamation groups; after the Haitian-American Coalition threatened to sue, Rockstar removed the word "Haitians" from this phrase in the game's subtitles.  . 

Lt. Col. [[Dave Grossman (author)|David Grossman]], a former [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] psychology professor, has written several books that pertain to the subject of violence in the media, including ''On Killing'' and ''Stop Teaching Our Kids to Kill''. During heights of video game controversy he has been interviewed on the content of his books, and has repeatedly used the term "murder simulator" to describe [[first-person shooter]] games. He argues that video game publishers unethically train children in the use of weapons and, more importantly, harden them emotionally to the act of murder by simulating the killing of hundreds or thousands of opponents in a single typical video game. Grossman's conclusions have been criticized by some scholars, however, as highly selective and misleading. <ref>Ferguson, C. J. “The school shooting/violent video game link: Causal relationship or moral panic?” Journal of Investigative Psychology and Offender Profiling. 5(2008):25-37. http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/shooters.pdf</ref> . 

Research published in 2001 suggested that violent video games may increase mild forms of aggressive behavior in children and young adults. Analyses also showed that exposure to violent video games results in increased physiological arousal, aggression-related thoughts and feelings as well as decreased prosocial behavior. The research comprised a meta analysis, laboratory and field studies. <ref name="Effects on aggressive behaviour"/> However meta-analyses by other groups have not replicated these findings <ref name="Meta-analysis of video game violence"/><ref name="Public Health Risks of Media Violence"/> and these other groups have been critical of attempts to link violent games with aggression. For instance John Sherry has said (2007) "Further, why do some researchers (e.g. Gentile & Anderson, 2003) continue to argue that video games are dangerous despite evidence to the contrary?” (p.&nbsp;244).  . 

A study by [[Craig A. Anderson|Dr. Craig A. Anderson]] ''et al.'' compared the effects of violent video games to those of smoking on lung cancer <ref>{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Craig|title= The influence of media violence on youth|publisher=PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST|date=December 2003|url= http://www.psychologicalscience.org/pdf/pspi/pspi43.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Lynch|first=Paul|title=The Effects of Violent Video Game Habits on Adolescent Aggressive Attitudes and Behaviors.|publisher=Society for Research in Child Development| date = April 2001|url=http://www.fragtopia.com/currrent-news-images-etc/Violent%20Video%20Games.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>  This view has been challenged, however. For instance, Ferguson (2010) has ruled out a relationship between video game violence and serious aggression, concluding "Taken together these meta-analyses range from those which argue against meaningful effects to those which find weak effects.  Thus the debate on video game violence has been reduced to whether video game violence produces no effects…or almost no effects." <ref> url= http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Video%20Games%201%20Year.pdf" |Blazing Angels or Resident Evil?  Can Violent Video Games Be a Force for Good?", Christopher J. Ferguson, Review of General Psychology'', 14, 68-81</ref> . 

Other studies reach the conclusion that violence in video games is not causally linked with aggressive tendencies. This was the conclusion of a 1999 study by the U.S. government, prompting [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[David Satcher]] to say, "We clearly associate media violence to aggressive behavior. But the impact was very small compared to other things. Some may not be happy with that, but that’s where the science is."<ref>{{cite news|last=Wright|first=Brad|title= Sounding the alarm on video game ratings|language=|publisher=CNN.com|date=2004-02-18|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/TECH/fun.games/12/19/games.ratings/|accessdate=2007-12-10}}</ref> A [[meta-analysis]] by [[psychologist]] [[Jonathan Freedman]], who reviewed over 200 published studies and found that the "vast and overwhelming majority" did not find a causal link, also reached this conclusion. <ref>{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Ian|title=US teen violence study exonerates video games|language=|publisher=IT Week|date=2007-03-06|url=http://www.itweek.co.uk/vnunet/news/2184836/link-video-games-violent-teens|accessdate=2007-12-10}}</ref> A US Secret Service study found that only 12% of those involved in school shootings were attracted to violent video games, while 24% read violent books and 27% were attracted to violent films. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/preventingattacksreport.pdf|title=Safe School Initiative Final Report|page=26|author=|last=Vossekuil|first= Bryan |coauthors=et al.|month=May|year=2002|publisher=U.S. Secret Service and U.S. Department of Education|format=PDF}}</ref> An Australian study found that only children already predisposed to violence were affected by violent games. <ref>{{cite web|url= http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/04/study_kids_unaf.html|title= Study: Kids Unaffected by Violent Games|date=April 2, 2007|publisher = Wired}}</ref> A recent long-term outcome study of youth found no long-term relationship between playing violent video game and youth violence or bullying <ref>"Video Games and Youth Violence: A Prospective Analysis in Adolescents", Christopher J. Ferguson, ''Journal of Youth and Adolescence''|url = http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Video%20Games%201%20Year.pdf</ref> . 

A recent longitudinal study of youth in Germany found that aggressive children tend to select more violent video games, not the inverse. This study found no evidence violent games are psychologically harmful to minors.  The authors further speculated other studies may have found spurious effects due to focusing on youth self-report of aggression rather than reports by parents or teachers, the so called "single responder bias" . <ref>"Preference for Violent Electronic Games and Aggressive Behavior among Children: The Beginning of the Downward Spiral?", Maria von Salisch, ''Media Psychology''</ref> . 

In ''[[Grand Theft Childhood|Grand Theft Childhood: The Surprising Truth About Violent Video Games and What Parents Can Do]]'', researchers/authors [[Lawrence Kutner (psychologist)|Lawrence Kutner]], PhD, and [[Cheryl K. Olson]], ScD, refute claims of violent behavior increase caused by violent video games. The researchers' study shows that adolescents that don't play video games at all are most at-risk for violent behavior (but without statistical significance), claiming that video game play is part of an adolescent boy's normal social setting. However, they do not completely deny violent (M-rated) video games' negative influences on pre-teens and teenagers. <ref>Authors' interview with G4: http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20080418/005355882.shtml</ref><ref>Kutner, Lawrence, PhD, and Cheryl K. Olson, ScD, ''Grand Theft Childhood: The Surprising Truth About Violent Video Games''. 2008. ISBN 0-7432-9951-5</ref> Kutner and Olson say the views of both alarmists and the video game industry are often supported by flawed or misconstrued studies. The real risks according to them are not just about exposure to violence, gore and sex but are more subtle with some children at greater risk than others. <ref>{{cite web|last=Kutner & Olson|title=Grand Theft Childhood|year=2008|url=http://www.grandtheftchildhood.com/GTC/Home.html}}</ref> . 

Official records show that violent crime rates have declined dramatically since the early 1990s in the USA, among both juveniles<ref>http://www.ojjdp.ncjrs.gov/ojstatbb/crime/JAR.asp</ref> and adults. <ref>[http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/gvc.htm#serious ]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/glance/tables/4meastab.htm ]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref> This is despite sales of violent video games exploding and their content becoming increasingly graphic during the same period. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/05/080514213432.htm |title=Could Violent Video Games Reduce Rather Than Increase Violence? |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=2008-05-15 |accessdate=2011-07-12}}</ref> <ref>[[Kierkegaard, Patrick]]. 2008. Video Games and Aggression. International Journal of Liability and Scientific Inquiry, 411--417. </ref>Video game violence is not the primary contributor to societal violence, however, as there are many other factors at play. <ref name="Anderson questions"/> . 

According to media scholar [[Henry Jenkins]]: . 

{{Quote|According to federal crime statistics, the rate of juvenile violent crime in the United States is at a 30-year low. Researchers find that people serving time for violent crimes typically consume less media before committing their crimes than the average person in the general population. It's true that young offenders who have committed school shootings in America have also been game players. But young people in general are more likely to be gamers — 90 percent of boys and 40 percent of girls play. The overwhelming majority of kids who play do NOT commit antisocial acts. According to a 2001 U.S. Surgeon General's report, the strongest risk factors for school shootings centered on mental stability and the quality of home life, not media exposure. The moral panic over violent video games is doubly harmful. It has led adult authorities to be more suspicious and hostile to many kids who already feel cut off from the system. It also misdirects energy away from eliminating the actual causes of youth violence and allows problems to continue to fester. <ref name="pbs.org">http://www.pbs.org/kcts/videogamerevolution/impactdani was here/myths.html</ref>}} . 

Fears have been expressed about exposure to violent video games. For example, politicians{{who|date=December 2011}} and other people and organizations{{who|date=December 2011}} have considered video games effects on society, where the causative factor was not clear, "there has been some fears specially from UK news service that hijackers may have used flight simulator software to practice flying jet planes, also, [[Beam Breakers]] removed all references to the [[World Trade Center]] already used in the game 1". <ref>Kurt, Squire. "Moral Panic Culture Blacklash and Reconstructing Video Games" Reconstructions, (2001), online Available:http://web.mit.edu/cms/reconstructions/repercussions/videogames.html [2007, september 7.], p. 1. </ref> . 

===Biological links to aggressive behavior===. 
Some researchers believe that while playing violent video games leads to violent actions, there are also biological influences that impact a person's choices. According to Sean P. Neubert of Rochester Institute of Technology, a person who is biologically predisposed to aggression will be more strongly influenced by violent scenes and thus will have a greater risk for carrying out destructive actions. For example someone with [[antisocial personality disorder]] has a greater risk of going out and shooting someone after playing hours of Grand Theft Auto or a game of a similar nature. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.personalityresearch.org/papers/kooijmans.html |title=Effects of Video Games on Aggression |publisher=Personalityresearch.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-12}}</ref><ref>Anderson, A. Greg. “Effects of Violent Video Games on Aggressive Behavior, Aggressive Cognition, Aggressive Affect, Physiological Arousal, and Prosocial Behavior: A Meta-Analytic Review of the Scientific Literature” Psychological Science. 12.5(2001):353-359. JSTOR. California State University East Bay. 2 Dec. 2010. http://library.csueastbay.edu</ref> . 

Other biological theories of aggression and violence have specifically excluded video game and other media effects.  For instance the Catalyst Model proposed by Ferguson and Beaver <ref>Ferguson, C.J. & Beaver, K. “Natural born killers: The genetic origins of extreme violence” Aggression and Violence Behavior. 14(5)(2009):286-294 [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VH7-4VWB1FV-1&_user=10&_coverDate=10%2F31%2F2009&_rdoc=3&_fmt=high&_orig=browse&_origin=browse&_zone=rslt_list_item&_srch=doc-info(%23toc%236059%232009%23999859994%231414082%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&_cdi=6059&_sort=d&_docanchor=&_ct=18&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=cb4e89d099068aca94aed8cd92bac2d5&searchtype=a]</ref> specifically exclude media violence as a contributor to violence, arguing research evidence for such effects have been weak, and media violence is too distal a factor to have much influence.  . 

===Sexual themes===. 
<!-- Citations to points made in this section need to be provided. -->
Sexual themes in video games are much less tolerated in the US than violent themes; the most well-known example of this is the [[Hot Coffee minigame controversy|Hot Coffee]] controversy. In June 2005, an entire portion of unused code was found within the main script of ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', allowing the player to simulate sex with the main character's girlfriends. The game could be accessed in the PC version via a [[Mod (computer gaming)|mod]], and through [[Datel Action Replay|Action Replay]] codes in the [[PlayStation 2|PS2]] and [[Xbox]] versions. <ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/news/2005/07/15/news_6129301.html Confirmed: Sex minigame in PS2 San Andreas] gamespot.com</ref> The fact that the scene was left on the disc, and could be accessed by altering a few bytes of the game's code via a hex editor, prompted the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB) to change the rating of San Andreas to "Adults Only" on July 20, 2005. The game was pulled from many stores; [[Rockstar Games]] posted a loss of $28.8 million that quarter. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2005/09/5285.ars |title=Hot coffee burns Take Two and Rockstar |first=Ken |last=Fisher |date=September 7, 2005 |accessdate=30 March 2011}}</ref> The most controversial video game of this nature was ''[[Rapelay]]'', a game revolving around [[rape]]. Worldwide public campaigns against it led to the game being banned. <ref>{{cite web|last=Meli|first=Marissa|title=The Most Controversial Video Games|url=http://www.ugo.com/games/most-controversial-video-games-rapelay|publisher=[[UGO Networks]]|accessdate=26 January 2012|page=11}}</ref> . 

====Nudity====. 
Almost no [[North America]]n video games display full frontal nudity. Sexual themes are more common in [[eroge|Japanese PC games]], but console companies such as Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony do not license adult-only content games for their systems.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} . 

====Portrayal of gender====. 
{{See also|Portrayal of women in video games}}
Bias of gender exists in games. [[Terry Flew]] writes that generally representations of gender in digital games are stereotyped. In many games, male characters are portrayed as hard bodied, muscled men, and female characters are portrayed as soft bodied, nearly naked women with large breasts.  In addition, Flew also believes that female characters in games are usually portrayed in a narrowly stereotypical manner. Females are usually constructed as visual objects who wait for male rescue and need to be protected, whereas men are portrayed with more power. Such depiction of females in games reflects underlying social ideas of dominance of male over female and themes of masculinity. Although not all video games contain such stereotypes, there are enough to make it a general trait. Ultimately, Flew ends with the statement of the broad demographic's excessive demands, in that '...different genders have different gaming.'<ref name="Flew 2005">Flew, Terry and Humphreys, Sal (2005) "Games: Technology, Industry, Culture" Oxford University Press</ref> . 

However, some video games do not conform to traditional gender roles such as the male being dominant and the female being submissive. One such example would be the protagonist [[Lara Croft]] in the [[Tomb Raider]] video game series, who is presented as a beautiful, clever, athletic, and brave English archaeologist-adventurer.

====LGBT characters====. 
{{see|LGBT themes in video games|List of LGBT characters in video games}}
Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender [[LGBT characters in video games|(LGBT) characters]] have been depicted in some video games [[List of LGBT characters in video games#1980s|since the 1980s]].

===Social development===. 
Over two hundred studies have been published which examine the effects of violence in entertainment media and which at least partially focus on violence in video games in particular. Some psychological studies<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bbushman/01ba.pdf|title=Media Violence and the American Public: Scientific Facts Versus Media Misinformation| accessdate =2007-07-10|format=PDF|work=|author= Bushman, Brad|authorlink=|coauthors= Anderson, Craig}}</ref> have shown a [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] between children playing violent video games and suffering psychological effects, although many other studies find no such link [[Causality|causation]].  . 

In 2004 the [[American Psychological Association]] summarized the issue as "Psychological research confirms that violent video games can increase children's aggression, but that parents moderate the negative effects."<ref>{{cite web|author=American Psychological Association|url=http://www.apa.org/research/action/games.aspx|title=Violent Video Games — Psychologists Help Protect Children from Harmful Effects}}</ref> A more recent press release by the APA in 2010 summarized recent research findings as "Bad effects depend on certain personality traits; games can offer learning opportunities for others". <ref name=APA2010>{{cite web|title=Violent Video Games May Increase Aggression in Some But Not Others, Says New Research|url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2010/06/violent-video-games.aspx|work=apa.org|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|accessdate=27 September 2011}}</ref> [[Craig A. Anderson|Craig Anderson]] has conducted [[meta-analysis]] of previous studies and claimed they have demonstrated five effects: "increased aggressive behavior, thoughts, and affect; increased physiological arousal; and decreased pro-social (helping) behavior". <ref name="Anderson">{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Craig A.|authorlink = Craig A.

(1987), Scott (1995), Ballard and Lineberger (1999), and Jonathan Freedman (2002). <ref>{{cite book|author=Freedman, Jonathan L.|title=Media violence and its effect on aggression: assessing the scientific evidence|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]| location=Toronto|year=2002|pages=|isbn=0-8020-8425-7|oclc=|doi=}}</ref> More recently, Block and Crain (2007) claim that in a critical paper by Anderson (and his co-author, Bushman), data was improperly calculated and produced fallacious results. <ref>{{cite journal| author =Block JJ, Crain BR|title=Omissions and errors in "media violence and the American public."|journal=The American psychologist|volume=62|issue=3|pages=252–3|year=2007|pmid=17469907|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.62.3.252}}</ref>  Other meta-analyses by other groups, such as by Ferguson and Kilburn (2009) and Sherry (2007) have repudiated any links between video game violence and aggression, as have recent reviews by the Australian Government (2010) and the US Supreme Court (June, 2011).  . 

After conducting a two-year study of more than 1,200 [[Middle School]] children about their attitudes towards video games, [[Harvard Medical School]] [[researcher]]s Lawrence Kutner and Cheryl Olson found that playing video games did not have a particularly negative effect on the researched group. <ref>{{cite news|last=Hillis |first=Scott |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKN0725760620080512?sp=true |title=Video games don't create killers, new book says |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |date= 2008-05-09|accessdate=2011-07-12}}</ref> . 

The portrayal of race in video games has also recently become an issue, seen in games such as the [[Grand Theft Auto (series)|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]], ''[[50 Cent: Bulletproof]]'', and ''[[Def Jam: Fight for NY]]''.  In 2009, the issue of race emerged with the release of ''[[Resident Evil 5]]'', which has the player kill numerous African enemies, resulting in arguments from both sides of the issue. Supporters of Resident Evil 5 argued however that to censor the portrayal of black antagonists was discrimination in itself. <ref>Resident Evil 5' Reignites Debate About Race in Videogames. The Wall Street Journal, 12 Mar. 2009. Web. 10 Nov. 2009. <http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123672060500987853.html>. </ref> A similar outrage also occurred when it was revealed that "[[Left 4 Dead 2]]", set in New Orleans, would include African-American zombies. These and other games demonstrate an interesting trend towards the increased presence of racial differences in video games. Indeed, it is true that “Significantly, these games, and particularly their questionable claims of authenticity, establish compelling learning environments that help facilitate how young gamers develop their knowledge of and familiarity with popular views of race and urban culture.”<ref>Citation: Everett, Anna, and Craig Watkins. “The Power of Play: The Portrayal and Performance of Race in Video Games."

==Publicized incidents==. 
{{POV-section|date=July 2011}}
Several incidents speculated to be related to video games in recent decades have helped fuel controversy. 
*On November 22, 1997, thirteen-year-old Noah Wilson died when his friend Yancy stabbed him in the chest with a kitchen knife. The mother of Noah, Andrea Wilson, alleged that her son was stabbed to death because of an obsession with the [[Midway Games|Midway]] game ''[[Mortal Kombat]]''. She alleged that Yancy S. was so obsessed with the game that he believed himself to be the character [[Cyrax]]. This character purportedly uses a [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|finishing move]] which involves getting the opponent in a headlock and stabbing them in the chest. Although Wilson alleged that this was the reason for her son's death, the character Cyrax does not actually perform this move at all. The conclusion of Wilson v. Midway Games, Inc. was, according to the court case report, "Wilson's complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted."<ref>{{cite web| title=Wilson v.

*On April 20, 1999, [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold|18-year-old Eric Harris and 17-year-old Dylan Klebold]] killed 12 students and a teacher in the [[Columbine High School massacre]]. The two were allegedly [[fixation (psychology)|obsessed]] with the video game ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]''. Harris also created [[Doom WAD|WADs]] for the game, and created a large [[mod (computer gaming)|mod]] named "Tier" which he called his "life's work".

Woolley's mother stated, "I think the way the game is written is that when you first start playing it, it is fun, and you make great accomplishments.

===Theories of video game effects===. 
Several theoretical approaches have been applied to potential video game violence effects (or lack of effects). These models compete, attempting to explain how video games may or may not have effects on players.  . 

For example the '''Catalyst Model''' of aggression comes from a diathesis-stress perspective, implying that aggression is due to a combination of genetic risk and environmental strain. <ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/CJBGames.pdf|title=Violent video games and aggression: Causal relationship or byproduct of family violence and intrinsic violence motivation?|first = Christopher| last = Ferguson| coauthors = Rueda, S., Cruz, A., Ferguson, D., Fritz, S., & Smith, S|journal = Criminal Justice and Behavior| year=2008|volume=35|pages=311–332}}</ref> The Catalyst Model suggests that stress, coupled with antisocial personalities is most salient in the creation of aggression. The Catalyst Model does allow that proximal influences such as family or peers may influence aggressiveness. However the Catalyst Model specifically states that media influences are too weak and distant to have much influence.  . 

The '''General Aggression Model''' (GAM) models video games as having an influence on people, proposing that a participant's thoughts, feelings and physical arousal can be affected by simulated violence. The GAM asserts this creates an effect on an individual's interpretation of an aggressive or violent act. <ref>Thomas A. Kooijmans. [http://www.personalityresearch.org/papers/kooijmans.html Effects of Video Games on Aggressive Thoughts and Behaviors During Development] ''[[Rochester Institute of Technology]]''. December 2004</ref> . 

The GAM claims that video games have both short- and long-term effects. In the short-term the aggressive cognitions, affects and arousal are posited to increase while long-term effects are asserted to be possible, but not yet accurately determined. Anderson and Bushman claim violent video games promote violent behavior, attitudes and beliefs by desensitizing an individual to aggression.  . 

==Regulation of video games==. 
In response to concerns about video games, governments around the globe have enacted or attempted to enact legislation regulating, prohibiting, or outright banning video games. Similarly, support for video game and media regulation has been linked to moral panic. <ref>{{cite web|author=Byrd, Patrick|year=2007|title=It's All Fun and Games Until Somebody Gets Hurt: The Effectiveness of Proposed Video Game Regulation|work=|url=http://www.houstonlawreview.org/archive/downloads/44-2_pdf/5_Byrd.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate= 2007-03-19}}</ref> To that end, different [[video game content rating system]]s have been introduced across the globe.  . 

Psychology professor Chris Ferguson discusses in an interview how these myths are perpetuated. When asked to describe the nature of how negative propaganda is spread by activist against video games, Ferguson explained that many respected academics and elected officials develop apprehension towards the media in question and formulate disproportionate accusations of harm. Those claims are out in the public when expert evidence proves them to be invalid, making it difficult to withdraw from such allegations. Possible motivations for why activist claims are not retracted are “…there are certain financial incentives and political incentives. It’s hard to get grant money arguing that something *isn’t* a problem…and some scholars take money from anti-media lobbying groups. Politically scholars to support a government mandated censorship regimen naturally intend to be in charge of that regimen themselves”. Ferguson adds that present research on violence in video games confirms no valid link, “The best studies now coming out — those which take care to use well-validated clinical outcome measures and which carefully control for other important risk factors — provide no support for the belief that VVG contributes to youth violence”<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/55382.html "Video Games Are Not the Enemy - The Drum Opinion (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)." ABC.net.au. Australia Broadcasting Corporation, 6 Apr. 2011. Web. 07 June 2011.]</ref> . 

Voluntary rating systems adopted by the video game industry, such as the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] rating system in the United States and Canada, as well as the [[Pan European Game Information]] (PEGI) rating system in Europe, that are aimed at informing parents about the types of games their children are playing (or are asking to play). Certain game publishers’ decision to have controversial games rated seems to show that they are not targeted at young children. They are rated by the ESRB as "Mature" (M) or "Adults Only" (AO) in the US, or given [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC) ratings of 15 or 18 in the UK. The packaging notes that these games should not be sold to children. In the US, ESRB ratings are not legally binding, but many retailers take it upon themselves to refuse the sale of these games to minors.  In the United Kingdom (UK), the BBFC ratings are backed up by law, so it is actually illegal to sell the game to anyone under the indicated age, and many UK retailers go beyond that and also enforce the PEGI ratings, which are not backed up by law. No video game console manufacturer has yet to allow any game to be published in North America with the harshest ESRB rating, "Adults Only", signaling that the game is only appropriate for ages 18 years and up. Additionally, no major retailers are willing to set aside shelf space for AO-rated games. Although Grand Theft Auto San Andreas was given a rating of AO after widespread surfacing of an add-on originally deleted from the game, "Hot Coffee," in which the player controls a fully clothed sexual encounter. It was later fully removed and the game retained the M rating. GTA San Andreas is the best selling game to ever receive the AO rating.  . 

The sales of M- and AO-rated games to minors has been an issue of much concern to parent groups and public officials, and bills have been submitted to government agencies, including the [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:h5990ih.txt.pdf Video Games Ratings Enforcement Act] introduced to the US House of Representatives in both the [[109th United States Congress|109th Congress]] and [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]]. The proposed legislation would require an ID check for M- and AO-rated game purchases. The bill was not passed into law, and other proposed bills were stopped<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117985230.html?categoryId=1064&cs=1 | work=Variety | first=William | last=Triplett | title=Bill targets teen gamers | date=7 May 2008}}</ref> because of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] violations.  . 

Although no law mandates ID checking for games with adult content, a 2008 [http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2008/05/secretshop.shtm secret shopper survey] done by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] shows that video game retailers have voluntarily increased ID verification for M- and AO-rated games, and sales of those games to underage potential buyers have been reduced from 83% in 2000 to only 20% in 2008.  . 

In April 2011, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] undercover shopper survey found that video game retailers continue to enforce the ratings by allowing only 13% of underage teenage shoppers to buy M-rated video games, a statistically significant improvement from the 20% purchase rate in 2009. <ref>"Violent Video Games Are The Hardest Media For Minors To Acquire, According To A Study From The FTC" News Release.

On January 7, 2009, Representative Joe Baca of California’s 43rd District introduced H.R. 231, the Video Game Health Labelling Act. This bill called for labels to be placed in a “clear and conspicuous location on the packaging” which states “WARNING: Excessive exposure to violent video games and other violent media has been linked to aggressive behaviour.” The proposed legislation mandated that all video games with an ESRB rating of T (Teen) or higher be subjected to the compulsory labelling. <ref>United States. Congress. 111th Congress, 1st Session. H.R. 231, Video Game Health Labelling Act [introduced in the U.S. Congress; 7 January 2009]. 111th Cong., 1st sess. Congressional Bills, GPO Access. http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr231ih/pdf/BILLS-111hr231ih.pdf</ref> The press release accompanying the introduction of the bill referred to scientific studies from the Pediatrics Journal, Indiana University, University of Missouri and Michigan State University which pointed to a “neurological link between playing violent video games and aggressive behaviour in children and teenagers.”<ref>Baca, Joe. "Rep. Baca Introduces Legislation to Make Violent Video Games Sold With Health Warning Label." News Release. January 7, 2009. http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/ca43_baca/videogame_health_010709.html</ref> The proposed legislation was referred on to the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection. On January 24, 2011; Rep. Joe Baca reintroduced the Video Game Health Labelling Act as H.R. 400 of the 112th Congress. <ref>United States. Congress. 112th Congress, 1st Session. H.R. 400, Video Game Health Labelling Act [introduced in the U.S. Congress; 24 January 2011]. 112th Cong., 1st sess. Congressional Bills, GPO Access. http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr400ih/pdf/BILLS-112hr400ih.pdf</ref> The bill was once again passed onto the Subcommittee.  . 

On June 27, 2011, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled on ''[[Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association]]'', cited video games as protected speech under the First Amendment. The case centered on a California law that sought to restrict sales of violent video games to minors. The video game industry, led by the [[Entertainment Merchants Association]] and the [[Entertainment Software Association]] successfully obtained an injunction on the bill, believing that definition of violence defined by the California law was too vague and would not treat video games as protected speech. This opinion was upheld in lower courts, and supported by the Supreme Court's decision. In the decision, the Court determined that there was no direct link between violent video games and their influence on children, in as much as compared to other types of media like television and pictures, and that they could not create a new class of restricted speech that is not applied to other forms of media. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20101101/NEWS02/11010316/1007 | title = Lawmaker keeps eye on video game case | first = Sean | last = O'Sullivan | date = 2010-11-01 | accessdate= 2010-11-11 | work = [[Delaware News-Journal]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20101110/news/711119887/ | title = Ban kids from buying violent video games in Illinois? | date= 2010-11-10 | accessdate=  2010-11-11 | first = Mike | last = Riopell | work = [[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]] }}</ref> . 

==Potential positive effects of video games==. 
Numerous researchers have proposed potential positive effects of video games on aspects of social and cognitive development and psychological well-being. <ref name="wonderful things"/> It has been shown that action video game players have better [[hand-eye coordination]] and visuo-motor skills, such as their resistance to distraction, their sensitivity to information in the peripheral vision and their ability to count briefly presented objects, than non-players. <ref>{{cite web|author=Nature |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v423/n6939/full/nature01647.html |title=Access : Action video game modifies visual selective attention |publisher=Nature |date= |accessdate=2011-07-12}}</ref>
Video games also develop the individual's intelligence, and in social games develop the social capabilities of the individual.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} . 

Another way in which the usage of video games might provide a benefit is in the relief of stress. There is a study being conducted by Dr.Cheryl Olson and her team at Massachusetts General Hospital’s (MGH) Center for Mental Health and Media and Harvard to prove that violent games help students deal with stress and aggression. She has found that over 49% of boys and 25% of girls use violent games such as [[Grand Theft Auto IV]] as an outlet for their anger. Dr. Olson has come to the conclusion that violent games affect students positively and not negatively because the violent crime rate is going down while the popularity of M-rated video games has increased. She suggests that instead of stopping children from playing M-rated games completely, parents should just monitor how much time their children spend playing games; parents should take responsibility. 
<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.science20.com/news/violent_video_games_help_kids_manage_stress |title=Violent Video Games Help Kids Manage Stress |publisher=Science20.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-12}}</ref> . 

Several studies have explored the possible benefits of [[multiplayer video games]] in a family setting. The most recent study found that girls 11-16 who played video games with their parents had better mental health and less aggressive behavior, with a stronger connection if they played age-appropriate games. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.byu.edu/archive11-jan-girlvideogames.aspx |title=Video games are good for girls – if parents play along |publisher=News.byu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-07-12}}</ref> . 

Many studies have been done on gaming and its integration into the classroom in order to support the educator. "The use of gaming has the ability to actively involve students in learning."<ref>Clark, A. C., & Ernst, J. V. (2009). Gaming in Technology Education. Technology Teacher, 68(5), 21-26. </ref> On-line gaming is especially important in helping students build collaborative skills while completing given tasks.  . 

To date, video game training appears to be one of the more interesting and promising means to improve perceptual, attentional, and cognitive abilities. One of its promises is that, compared to traditional training, it can be engaging and entertaining. This has led some companies to begin to market video games for the specific purpose of improving cognition. For example, Nintendo advertises "Big Brain Academy" as a game that "trains your brain with a course load of mind-bending activities across five categories: think, memorize, analyze, compute, and identify". <ref>Walter R. Boot *, Arthur F. Kramer, Daniel J. Simons, Monica Fabiani, Gabriele Gratton, Acta Psychologica; Beckman Institute, Department of Psychology, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801, USA</ref> . 

It enables players to explore various aspects of their identity in a virtual world. <ref name="Flew and Humphreys"/> . 

Journalist and author, David Sheff, believes that many skills can be learned from the gaming experience, it builds practical and intellectual skills, "by playing video games children gain problem solving abilities, perseverance, pattern recognition, hypothesis testing, estimating skills,  inductive skills, resources management, logistics mapping, memory, quick thinking and reasonable judgements". <ref>Sheff, David. Video Games: A Guide for Savvy Parents. Random House, New York, 1994, p. 33. </ref> . 

Research at [[University of Rochester]] suggest that playing video games that contain high levels of action can improve eyesight. <ref name="Action Video Games Improve Vision">University of Rochester, Jonathan Sherwood. "Action Video Games Improve Vision". News article at the universities main website: http:// http://www.rochester.edu/news/show.php?id=3342</ref> . 

Many authors disagree with the notion that suggests that the media can cause violence, they propose media cannot cause violence because humans have the ability to recognize what is wrong, and what is right.  They suggest people are not going to mistake fiction for reality. Some people who criticize the proposed negative effects based their research are Terry Flew, Sal Humphreys, Martin Barker and Jonathan Freedman. 
<ref name="Flew and Humphreys">Flew, Terry and Humphreys, Sal. "Games: Technology, Industry, Culture" in New Media: an introduction (second edition), ed.

J.C. Herz argued that many so-called negative effects of video games, such as aggression and lack of pro-social behavior, are both necessary and useful traits to have in a [[capitalistic]] society. Specifically, Herz argued that many academic researchers have an anti-capitalist bias, and thus failed to notice the benefits of such traits. <ref>Herz, J.C. Joystick Nation: How Videogames Ate Our Quarters, Won Our Hearts, and Rewired Our Minds. New York: Little Brown and Company, 1997. </ref> . 

Some authors also suggest that video games have many healthy and positive aspects, for example they can be a safe outlet for aggression and frustration. <ref name="Quirk">Quirk, Jennifer.
