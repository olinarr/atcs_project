'''''Mortal Kombat''''' is a 1992 fighting-game developed and published by [[Midway Games|Midway]] for [[video arcade|arcades]]. In 1993, home versions were released by [[Acclaim Entertainment]].  . 

Upon its release, the first title of the infamous ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' series became one of the most popular arcade games of all time. ''Mortal Kombat'' was subsequently ported to nearly every home video game platform of the time and became a best-selling game. ''Mortal Kombat'' also became one of the most controversial video games, for its depiction of gore and violence using realistic digitized graphics. <ref>{{cite news|title= Video Violence: It's Hot!

''Mortal Kombat'' focuses on the journey of the monk [[Liu Kang]] to save Earth from the evil sorcerer [[Shang Tsung]], ending with their confrontation on the tournament known as Mortal Kombat. The game spawned numerous sequels, as well as a successful 1995 [[Mortal Kombat (film)|motion picture]] adaptation, and is one of the most popular fighting games to date.  . 

==Gameplay==. 
''Mortal Kombat'' is a fighting game in which players battle opponents in one-on-one matches. The player that depletes the opponent's [[health bar]] first wins the round and the first player to win two rounds wins the match.  . 

Players select one of 7 characters. Whereas other fighting games had characters with considerable differences in speed, height, attacks, strength, jumping heights and distances, the playable characters in ''Mortal Kombat'' are virtually identically to one another with only minimal differences in their moves' range and speed.  . 

The game also distinguished itself from other fighting games of the time with its unique control scheme. The controls consist of five buttons arranged in an "X" pattern: four buttons for high and low punches and kicks with a block button at the center, as well as an eight-way joystick. Attacks can vary depending on the player's distance from the opponent. All player characters have a shared set of attacks performed by holding the joystick in various directions, such a leg sweep and the uppercut, which knocks enemies high into the air and causes a large amount of damage. 
[[Image:Fatality.png|thumb|[[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)#First incarnation|Sub-Zero]] performing his infamous "Spine Rip" on [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]], [[Ed Boon]]'s favorite Fatality. <ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]] Premium Edition |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=October 11, 2006 |level="The History of Fatalities" commentary}}</ref>]] . 

''Mortal Kombat'' also featured unique ways in which special moves were performed. It was the first game to introduce special moves performed exclusively using the joystick. Most special moves were performed by tapping the joystick, sometimes ending with a button press. Unlike previous one-on-one fighting games, few moves required circular joystick movement. In an interview with ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'', [[Ed Boon]] stated, "[...] since the beginning, one of the things that's separated us from other fighting games is the crazy moves we've put in it, like fireballs and all the magic moves, so to speak."<ref>{{cite web |first= Stuart |last= Bishop |title=Ed Boon talks Mortal Kombat |date= April 23, 2007 |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=162494 |publisher= [[Computer and Video Games]] |accessdate= October 18, 2009}}</ref> Another of the game's innovations was the [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|Fatality]], a finishing move executed against a beaten opponent to kill them in a gruesome fashion. <ref name="MK3">{{cite web | author = Gertsmann, Jeff | url = http://uk.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/ultimatemortalkombat3/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary;read-review | title = Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 Review | publisher = GameSpot | date = October 24, 2008 | accessdate = January 11, 2009 }}</ref> . 

The game's blocking system also distinguished itself from other fighting games. Unlike ''Street Fighter '' characters take a small amount of damage from regular moves while blocking. However, the dedicated block button allows users to defend against attacks without retreating and blocking characters lose very little ground when struck, thus making counter attacks much easier after a successful block.  . 

''Mortal Kombat'' also introduced the concept of "juggling", knocking an opponent into the air and following up with a combination of attacks while the enemy is still airborne and defenseless. The idea became so popular that it has spread to many other games.  . 

===Single/multiplayer game===. 
In the single player game, players face each of the game's characters in a series of one-on-one matches against computer-controlled opponents, ending in a mirror match against the character that the player has selected. The player then must fight in a series of endurance matches featuring two opponents in each round. A second player can join in at any time to fight against the first player.  . 

Between certain levels, players can compete in a [[minigame]] called "Test Your Might" for bonus points. In this minigame, players must [[breaking (martial arts)|break]] blocks of various materials by filling a meter past a certain point through rapid button presses. The first material the player must break is [[wood]], once broken, players progress onto [[stone]], then to [[steel]], [[ruby]] and finally, [[diamond]], with each successive material requiring more of the meter to be filled up and thus awarding more points. Two players can compete in the minigame at once and the last two materials are only accessible through two-player mode. The minigame would return in various forms in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance]]'', ''[[Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]''. <ref name="MK vs DC strategy guide">{{Cite journal |first=Pat |last=Reynolds |title=Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe Strategy Guide by Pat Reynolds  |journal=[[Tips & Tricks]]|publisher=[[Larry Flynt Publications]]  |date=March/April 2009  |page=5}}</ref> . 

==Plot and setting==. 
The game takes place in a [[fantasy]] setting, with most of the game's events occurring in the [[fictional universe|fictional realms]] of the ''Mortal Kombat'' series. The original takes place in Earthrealm, where a tournament is being held at Shang Tsung's Island, on which seven of its locations serve as stages in the game. In ''Mortal Kombat'', the player receives information about the characters in biographies displayed during the [[attract mode]]. Additional information about the characters and their motivations for entering the tournament is received upon completion of the game with each character.  . 

===Story===. 
The original ''Mortal Kombat'' is the only game in the series to not have an introduction video explaining its plot. The story was fully explained in subsequent games, starting with ''Mortal Kombat II.'' The introduction to ''Mortal Kombat II'' explains that Shang Tsung was banished to Earthrealm 500 years ago and with the help of the monstrous Goro is able to seize control of the Mortal Kombat tournament in an attempt to doom the realm. <ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat 2]] |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=1994 |level=Opening sequence}}</ref> . 

The storyline of the first ''Mortal Kombat'' was later adapted into [[Paul W. S. Anderson]]'s ''[[Mortal Kombat (film)|Mortal Kombat]]'' [[motion picture]], and also in an animated prequel to the first movie titled ''[[Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins]]'', released direct to video. An alternate climax for the first game would be featured on the adventure game ''[[Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks]]'', which tells an alternate version of the events between the first and second Mortal Kombat tournaments.  . 

===Characters===. 
[[Image:MK character select.png|thumb|''Mortal Kombat'' character selection screen, showing [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|Kano]] and [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]]]]
''Mortal Kombat'' included seven playable characters, all of which would eventually become trademark characters and appear in sequels. The game was developed with digitized sprites based on actors. <ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[GamePro]] |author=Staff |page=117 |title=The Minds Behind Mortal Kombat II |issue=59 |month=June |year=1994}}</ref><ref name="Credits of Mortal Kombat 1 from 1:22-1:59">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dddmSvd4mY YouTube - MK1 Scorpion Ending<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The [[protagonist]] of the game is the Shaolin martial artist Liu Kang, played by [[Ho Sung Pak]], who enters the tournament to defeat antagonist Shang Tsung, the main antagonist and final [[boss (video games)|boss]] (also played by Sung Pak).  . 

[[Elizabeth Malecki]] played the Special Forces agent [[Sonya Blade]], who is pursuing the Black Dragon mercenary [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|Kano]] (played by [[Richard Divizio]]). [[Carlos Pesina]] played Raiden, the god of Thunder, while his brother [[Daniel Pesina]] played Hollywood movie star [[Johnny Cage]] and the ninja specter [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]] as well as the game's two other ninja characters. The yellow color of Scorpion's costume was changed to blue to create the Lin Kuei warrior [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]] and to green for the game's secret character [[Reptile (Mortal Kombat)|Reptile]]. <ref name="mkad">{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]] |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=October 11, 2006 |level=Reptile Kombat Card video}}</ref> ''Mortal Kombat'' would become famous for these [[palette swap]]s, and later games would continue it.  . 

The four-armed Shokan warrior [[Goro (Mortal Kombat)|Goro]] serves as the [[boss (video games)|sub boss]] of the game, being a half-human, half-dragon beast much stronger than the other characters, and unaffected by some of their manouveres. The character's [[stop motion]] model was created by Curt Chiarelli. When fighting on the Pit stage, the player could qualify to fight the [[secret character]] Reptile by meeting a special set of conditions. <ref name="Reptile">{{cite web |first1=Chip |last1=Carter |first2= Jonathan |last2= Carter|title= They are just dying to talk about Mortal Kombat |url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JvwNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=t3sDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6678,2240242&dq=mortal+kombat&hl=en |date= 1994-02-07 |publisher=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |accessdate=2009-12-01}}{{dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref> Goro, Shang Tsung, and Reptile were not playable in the original game, but would become playable in sequels.

==Development and promotion==. 
Originally, creators [[Ed Boon]] and [[John Tobias]] wanted to create an action game featuring a digitized version of martial arts film star [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]]. <ref>[http://g4tv.com/gamemakers/episodes/3446/Mortal-Kombat.html Video Games, Game Reviews & News - G4tv.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Van Damme was already in negotiations with another company for a video game that ultimately was never released. Van Damme's likeness remained in the form of playable character [[Johnny Cage]] (with whom he shares his name's initials, JC), a Hollywood martial arts movie star who performs a split punch to the groin (performed by Van Damme in a scene from ''[[Bloodsport (film)|Bloodsport]]''<ref>{{cite web |title= Bloodsport Fight #2 at 6:50|url= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtcrFCfoyxo|date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=20 July 2009}}{{dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref>). Ed Boon and John Tobias have stated that Midway tasked them with the project of creating a "combat game for release within a year", which the two believed was intended to compete with the popular ''Street Fighter''. <ref name="1994 interview"/> ''Mortal Kombat'' was reportedly developed in 10 months from 1991 to 1992, with a test version seeing limited release halfway through the development cycle. <ref>{{cite web |first= David |last= Craddock |title= The Rogues Gallery: Controversial Video Games |date= 2005-09-29 |url=http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=23 |publisher= [[Shacknews]] |accessdate= 2009-09-08}}</ref><ref name="1994 interview">

The team had difficulty settling on a name for the game. Boon has stated that for six months during development "...nobody could come up with a name nobody didn't hate." Some of the names suggested were [[Kumite]], Dragon Attack, Death Blow and Fatality. Someone had written down "combat" on the drawing board for the names in Boon's office and someone wrote a K over the C, according to Boon, "...just to be kind of weird..." Pinball designer [[Steve Ritchie]] was sitting in Boon's office, saw the word "Kombat" and said to him, "Why don't you name it Mortal Kombat?", a name that Boon stated "just stuck."<ref>{{cite web |title= Episode 123 of KOXM |url= http://dl.oxmonline.com/oxmp_123_20080710.mp3 |date= 2008-07 |publisher= [[Official Xbox Magazine]] |accessdate=October 21, 2009}}</ref> The series itself commonly uses the letter [[Hard and soft C|"K" in place of "C"]] for words containing the [[voiceless velar plosive|hard C]] sound.  . 

The launch of ''Mortal Kombat'' for home consoles by Acclaim Entertainment was one of the largest video game launches of the time. A flood of TV commercials heralded the simultaneous release of all four home versions of the game on September 13, 1993, a date dubbed "Mortal Monday. " In the same year, an official ''[[Mortal Kombat (comics)#Mortal Kombat Collector's Edition|Mortal Kombat Collector's Edition]]'', written and illustrated by the game's designer artist John Tobias, was available through [[mail order]], describing the backstory of the game in a greater detail. The mail order deal was displayed during the [[attract mode]] of the game. The comic book would later be sold normally around the country, although it was close to impossible to get a copy outside of the United States. The entire comic book was later included as an unlockable bonus in "The Krypt" mode of ''Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance''.  . 

''[[Mortal Kombat: The Album]]'', an album by [[The Immortals (band)|The Immortals]] featuring [[techno]] songs, was released in May 1994. It features two themes for the game, "Techno Syndrome" and "Hypnotic House". "Techno Syndrome" was adapted for the 1995 movie soundtrack and incorporated the familiar "Mortal Kombat!" yell from the Mortal Monday commercials. <ref>[http://immortals.pragakhan.com/biography.html The Immortals - Biography<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Jeff Rovin]] also penned a novelization of the first ''Mortal Kombat'' game, which was published in June 1995 in order to coincide with the release of the first movie. There were also lines of [[action figure]]s based on the original characters.  . 

==Ports==. 
Four official ports released as part of the "Mortal Monday" campaign in 1993. [[Sega Genesis]]/Mega Drive and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] were the home console ports, while handheld console ports were released for [[Game Boy]] and [[Game Gear]]. While the SNES version's visuals and audio was accurate than the Genesis/Mega Drive version, it features changes to the gameplay and due to Nintendo's "Family Friendly" policy, replaced the blood with sweat and most of the fatalities with less violent "finishing moves". <ref name="archive.gamespy.com">[http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/june03/dumbestmoments/readers/index4.shtml Gamespy's The 25 Dumbest Moments in Gaming]</ref>  On Sega's console, the blood and uncensored fatalities were available via a [[cheat code]]. The code spelled out "ABACABB",<ref>{{cite web |first= Travis |last= Fahs |title= IGN Presents the History of Mortal Kombat |date= 2008-10-13 |url= http://retro.ign.com/articles/919/919357p2.html |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2009-12-06}}</ref> a nod to the ''[[Abacab]]'' album by the band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] who shared their name with the North American version of the console. A unique [[Easter egg]] in this version included a head shot of the President of Probe Software, Fergus McGovern, which sometimes flew in front of the moon in The Pit stage. This version was given an MA-13 rating by the [[Videogame Rating Council]]. The Japanese port was named ''Mortal Kombat: Shinken Kourin Densetsu''. <ref>{{cite web |title=Mortal Kombat: Shinken Kourin Densetsu (JP, 05/27/94) |url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/genesis/563332-mortal-kombat/images/box-2952 |accessdate= 2009-09-02}}</ref> . 

The Game Boy version was severely cut down from its arcade counterpart.  It suffered from laggy controls and a limited button layout. It also omitted Reptile and the bloodier Fatality moves. However, players could play as Goro via a code. <ref>{{cite web|title=Mortal Kombat Review|url=http://retro.nintendolife.com/reviews/2010/08/mortal_kombat_retro|date=2010-08-05|accessdate=2010-08-07}}</ref>Johnny Cage was apparently intended to be a playable character, but was cut out ; bits of his character data remain in the data files. <ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD3C-BUoOEs&feature=related]</ref> The Game Gear version was similar to the Game Boy version, but with major improvements, (color, faster gameplay, and tighter control). Like its 16-bit counterpart, the game was censored unless a cheat code had been entered. It lacked Kano and Reptile and had only two arenas. A [[Sega Master System]] port based on this version was also released.  . 

Ports for [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]]/[[MS-DOS]] and the [[Amiga]] were also released in 1993. Both the IBM PC version and MS-DOS are the most faithful ports of the arcade version in terms of graphics and gameplay. The PC and DOS ports differ in terms of music score however; the DOS version was more accurate in that factor. The DOS version came in CD and floppy-disk formats {{clarify|date=January 2011}} The Amiga version's gameplay was limited to one action button, and featured a cut down soundtrack with music arranged by [[Allister Brimble]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.  . 

The [[Mega-CD]]/Sega CD version of the game was released featuring a video intro of the ''Mortal Monday'' commercial and loading times. This port did not require a code to be entered to access the uncensored content and thus was given an MA-17 rating. While this port was technologically [[inferior]] to the better-looking SNES port, it resembled the arcade version more faithfully in actual gameplay. It also featured the authentic soundtrack as [[redbook audio]], taken right from the arcade version, but some of the tracks play on the incorrect arenas, (such as Courtyard playing The Pit's theme). Several remixes of the ''Mortal Kombat'' theme music were included as bonus, including the remix used later for the film adaptation. The gore could be disabled by entering the "DULLARD" code at the main menu. 
With the release of ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deception]]'' "Premium Pack" [[Xbox]]/[[PlayStation 2]] in [[2004 in video gaming|2004]], both the Xbox and PlayStation 2 received ports of the game as bonus content. While it was promoted as "arcade perfect", there were some sound issues and sped up gameplay. <ref name="MK Deception Limited Edition">[http://ps2.ign.com/articles/535/535211p1.html MK Deception Limited Edition – PlayStation 2 News at IGN<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> That same year, [[Jakks Pacific]] release the game as one of its Plug It in & Play TV Games. The game comparisons to the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version but with different music and the original arcade voices. This port lacks flashing text and a scrolling background layer, so moving objects—such as the clouds on The Pit and Palace Gates stages and the monks in the Courtyard—instead remain static. The programmer of this port was Chris Burke, for developer [[Backbone Entertainment|Digital Eclipse]]. <ref>[http://cyberabi.ipower.com/Gallery/JakksMK/index.html "''Mortal Kombat'' for Jakks TV Games"]. Retrieved 2010-08-26. </ref> [[image:Turboninjaeditionmortalkombat.png|thumb|The intro screen has been changed, and Reptile can be easily fought in Turbo Ninja.]] . 

The game was a part of 2005's compilation Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play. This port features the same controls, graphics and gore that the original game contained, but like ''Mortal Kombat: Deception'' "Premium Pack", it suffers from sound issues, and has no bios of the characters.  . 

On August 31, 2011, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment released an Arcade Collection consisting of ''Mortal Kombat'', ''Mortal Kombat II'', and ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3'' as a downloadable title for [[PlayStation Network]], [[Xbox LIVE Arcade]], and PC.  . 

===Unofficial ports===. 
* [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] - This version was illegally ported by Hummer Team as "Mortal Kombat II" and "Mortal Kombat III" (some with and without the "Turbo" in the name) and by Yoko (aka Cony) as "Mortal Kombat V1996 Turbo 30 Peoples". 
* [[ZX Spectrum|Sinclair ZX Spectrum]] - Two unfinished but playable unofficial versions exist, one created in Ukraine in 1997 and the other in [[Russia]], both uses converted graphics. One unofficial full version exists too (1996); this one uses only the characters and setting of original game, and has its own graphics. It is mainly based on the first game and the first movie, but it has some features from ''Mortal Kombat II'' and ''Mortal Kombat 3'' (for example, Liu Kang's "Fire Teleport" Fatality from MK3).  . 

===Hacks and other revisions===. 
In the arcade version of ''Mortal Kombat'', there were hacked versions of the arcade:
* 3.1 Turbo/Kombo edition - This was an extremely rare hack for the arcade version, which tweaked the gameplay for more juggling and made the speed of ''Mortal Kombat'' up to ''Mortal Kombat II'' faster standards. Other features include Sub-Zero's freeze tweaked to levitate opponents to the top of the screen, which meant more combo possibilities, and fight Reptile faster (without double Flawless Victories but still with a Fatality, even without going to The Pit stage). <ref>http://www.vm68.com/mkromhacks/mk_kombo.html Mortal Kombat 3.1 Turbo/Kombo edition information and screenshots. </ref>
* Turbo Ninja - Another rare hack, but it is similar to 3.1 Turbo. This was the first ''Mortal Kombat'' hack dumped on MAME. <ref>http://www.mameworld.info/ August 25, 2009, dumping information of Mortal Kombat Turbo Ninja edition with screenshots of the PCB board. </ref>
* Nifty Kombo - It is an earlier edition of 3.1 Turbo, similar features to its successor. Some differences includes Sub-Zero's freeze levitating opponents about an inch, and a harder Goro. <ref>[http://www.vm68.com/mkromhacks/mk_nifty_kombo.html Mortal Kombat Nifty Kombo edition information and screenshot.]</ref> .

===Controversy===. 
''Mortal Kombat'' was one of many violent video games that came into prominence between 1992 and 1993, generating controversy among parents and public officials. <ref>{{cite news|title= Too Violent for Kids? |work= Time|date=1993-09-27|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979298,00.html|accessdate=2010-03-04}}</ref>  Hearings on video game violence and the corruption of society, headed by [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Joseph Lieberman]] and [[Herb Kohl]] were held in late 1992 to 1993. The result of the hearings was that the entertainment software industry was given one year to form a working rating system or the federal government would intervene and create its own system. Eventually, the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB) was conceived, requiring all video games to be rated and for these ratings to be placed on the games' packaging. <ref>{{cite web |first= Chris |last= Kohler |title= This Day In Tech Events That Shaped the Wired World July 29, 1994: Videogame Makers Propose Ratings Board to Congress |url= http://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2009/07/dayintech_0729/ |date= 2009-07-24 |publisher= [[Wired News]] |accessdate= 2009-10-18}}</ref> . 

===Rumored content===. 
While many games have been subject to [[urban legends]] about secret features and unlockable content, these kinds of myths were particularly rampant among the dedicated fan community of the ''Mortal Kombat'' series. The game's creators did little to dispel the rumors, some of which were even eventually implemented in subsequent games. The most notable of these myths was due to a glitch where the hidden character Reptile was displayed red instead of green. As a result of this error, an internal error counter indicated as "ERMAC" (ERror MACro) was incremented. This would later lead the developers to include the red-garbed ninja [[Ermac]] on ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3]]'' and subsequent games. According to [[UGO.com]], there was also an urban legend circulating around the time that had to do with inputting a secret code in the SNES version of ''Mortal Kombat'' that would allow uncensored Fatalities and blood in the SNES. However, this was later proven untrue, being only available on the Mega Drive/Genesis version of ''Mortal Kombat''. <ref>{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Plante |title= Video Game Urban Legends
