'''Video game addiction''', also known as '''video game overuse''', is extreme use of [[personal computer game|computer]] and [[video game|video]] [[game]]s that interferes with daily life. Instances have been reported in which users play compulsively, isolating themselves from family and friends or from other forms of [[social contact]], and focus almost entirely on in-game achievements rather than other life events, and exhibit lack of imagination and mood swings. <ref>[http://parents.berkeley.edu/advice/teens/gameaddiction.html Computer Game Addiction.]  Berkeley Parents Network.

== Possible disorder ==. 
Video game addiction is not included as a diagnosis in either the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] or the [[ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]].  . 

However, some scholars suggest the effects (or symptoms) of video game overuse may be similar to those of other proposed [[Behavioral addiction|psychological addictions]]. <ref name="Khan">Khan, Mohamed K.

According to Griffiths<ref name="Griffiths">Griffiths, M.(2010)Online video gaming: what should educational psychologists know?. Educational Psychology in Practice, 26(1), 35-40. doi:10.1080/02667360903522769</ref>“all addictions (whether chemical or behavioural) are essentially about constant rewards and reinforcement”. Griffiths<ref name=Griffiths/> believed that addiction has six components: salience, mood modification, tolerance, withdrawal, conflict, and relapse. Some scholars suggest that psycho-social dependence, if it occurs, may revolve around the intermittent reinforcements in the game and the need to belong. <ref name=Griffiths/> Some scholars claim that the social dependence that may arise from video games occurs online where players interact with others and the relationships “often become more important for gamers than real-life relationships”. <ref name="Hagedorn">Hagedorn, W., & Young, T.

In 2007, the [[American Psychiatric Association]] reviewed whether or not video game addiction should be added in the new DSM to be released in 2012. The conclusion was that there was not enough research or evidence to conclude that video game addiction was a disorder. <ref name="Tanner2007">{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19354827/|title=Is video-game addiction a mental disorder?|last=Tanner|first=Lindsey|date=June 22, 2007|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=2009-05-09}}</ref><ref name=notenough1>

The report noted problems in the field with defining and measuring pathological gaming and concluded that pathological gaming behaviors were more likely the product of underlying mental health problems rather than the inverse.  .

A 2007 [[Harris Interactive]] online [[Opinion poll|poll]] of 1,187 [[United States]] youths aged 8–18 gathered detailed data on youth opinions about video game play. About 81% of youths stated that they played video games at least once per month. Further, the average play time varied by age and sex, from eight hours per week (responses from teen girls) to 14 hours per week (responses by teen boys). 
"[[Preadolescence|Tween]]s" (8–12-year-olds) fell in the middle, with boys averaging 13 hours per week of reported game play and girls averaging 10.

A 2009 survey by the [[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health]] (CAMH) in Toronto, Ontario of 9,000 students from Grades 7 to 12 showed almost 10% get "screen time" for seven (or more) hours a day. A little over 10% also reported having video gaming problems in the previous year. A recent article [[Pediatrics (journal)]] found a mild association between watching television or playing a video game and attention issues in more than 1,300 children ages eight to 11 years old. Children who played video games or watched television for more than the normal two hours a day maximum, which is recommended by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] were 1.5 - 2 times more likely to show signs of attention issues, the researchers found. However, the study was further criticized in eLetters to the same journal for failing to use well-validated measures of attention problems or control for other important variables. <ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1542/peds.2009-1508 | title = Television and Video Game Exposure and the Development of Attention Problems | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 126 | issue = 2 | pages = 214–21 |date = August 2010| first = Edward | pmid = 20603258 | last = Swing | coauthors = Douglas A.

== Possible symptoms ==. 
Excessive use of video games may have some or all of the [[symptoms]] of [[drug addiction]] or other proposed [[Behavioral addiction|psychological addictions]]. 
Some players become more concerned with their interactions in the game than in their broader lives. 
Players may play many hours per day, having late [[Bathing|baths]] and regarding personal hygiene as a waste of time, gain or lose significant weight due to playing, disrupt sleep patterns to play and suffer [[sleep deprivation]] as an effect, play at work, standing in the middle of nowhere looking into [[space]] for a considerable amount of time, avoiding phone calls from friends and/or lying about play time. <ref name="Tanner2007" /><ref name="7069OnlineSurveys"/> An example of this to the extreme is “A seventeen year old boy named Zach Richardson would go on streaks of fifteen hours of straight playing.  He skipped meals and only stopped when he blacked out.”<ref>{{cite web|last=G|first=Krey|title=Bad Parenting Leads To 15 Hourr A day Gaming Habit For Teen|url=<http://www.hotbloodedgaming.com/2010/08/27/bad-parenting-leads-to-15-hour-a-day-gaming-habit-for-teen/>.|publisher=Hot Blooded Gaming|accessdate=2011-12-02}}</ref>  . 

Other scholars have cautioned that comparing the symptoms of problematic gaming with problematic gambling is flawed, may introduce research artifacts and artificially inflate prevalence estimates. For instance Richard Wood has observed that behaviors which are problematic in regards to gambling may not be as problematic when put into the context of other behaviors that are rewarding such as gaming. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/kk6k288445l0h5x0/|title=Problems with the Concept of Video Game "Addiction": Some Case Study Examples

Thus it is unclear whether video game addiction should be considered a unique diagnosis.  . 

Researchers at the [[University of Rochester]] and Immersyve, Inc. (a Celebration, Florida, computer gaming [[Think-tank]]) investigated what motivates gamers to continue playing video games. 
According to lead investigator Richard Ryan, they believe that players play for more reasons than fun alone. 
Ryan, a motivational psychologist at Rochester, says that many video games satisfy basic psychological needs, and players often continue to play because of rewards, freedom, and a connection to other players. <ref>[http://ndri.com/article/cause_and_impact_of_video_games_addiction_-211.html Cause and Impact of Video Games Addiction.] All about Health, News, Articles, Discussion.

However, Dr. Brody also cautioned that for some children and adolescents, "... it displaces physical activity and time spent on studies, with friends, and even with family."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.aacap.org/cs/2007_press_releases/child_and_adolescent_psychiatrists_react_to_ama_recommendation_on_video_games| title=Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists React to AMA Recommendation on Video Games|accessdate=January 31, 2009|publisher=The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP)|date=June 28, 2007}}</ref> . 

Dr. Karen Pierce, a psychiatrist at [[Chicago]]'s [[Children's Memorial Hospital]], sees no need for a specific gaming addiction diagnosis. Two or more children see her each week because of excessive computer and video game play, and she treats their problems as she would any addiction.

Some countries, such as [[South Korea]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]], have responded to the perceived threat of video game addiction by opening treatment centers. <ref name="Faiola"/> . 

Because few clinical trials and no meta-analyses have been completed, research is still in the preliminary stages for excessive gaming treatment.

The suicide notes were written through the eyes of a gaming character, so reports the ''China Daily'', and stated that he hoped to meet three gaming friends in the after life.
