'''Role-playing video games''' (commonly referred to as '''role-playing games''' or '''RPGs''') are a [[Video game genres|video game genre]] where the player controls a character, and lives as this character when immersed in a fictional world. Many role playing games have origins in pen-and-paper [[role-playing game (pen and paper)|role-playing games]]<ref name="AdRol347">[[#AdRol|Adams, Rollings 2003]], p. 347</ref> such as ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', using much of the same terminology, [[Setting (fiction)|settings]] and [[game mechanic]]s. The player in RPGs controls one character, or several adventuring party members, fulfilling one or many [[Quest (gaming)|quests]]. The major similarities with pen-and-paper games involve developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as [[Replay value|replayability]] and immersion. Electronic medium removes the necessity for a [[gamemaster]] and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple [[Text-based game|text-based]] console-window games into visually rich [[3D computer graphics|3D]] experiences.  . 

==Characteristics==. 
Role-playing video games use much of the same terminology, [[Setting (fiction)|settings]] and [[game mechanic]]s as early pen-and-paper [[role-playing game]]s such as ''Dungeons & Dragons''. <ref>{{cite web

Generally, the player controls a central game character, or multiple game characters, usually called a party, and achieves victory by completing a series of quests or reaching the conclusion of a central storyline. Players explore a game world, while solving puzzles and engaging in tactical combat. A key feature of the genre is that characters grow in power and abilities, and characters are typically designed by the player. <ref name="AdRol347"/> RPGs rarely challenge a player's physical coordination, with the exception of [[action role-playing game]]s. <ref name="fundamentals"/> . 

Role-playing video games typically rely on a highly developed story and setting,<ref>[[#AdRol|Adams, Rollings 2003]], p. 347-248</ref> which is divided into a number of quests. Players control one or several characters by issuing commands, which is performed by the character at an effectiveness determined by that character's numeric attributes. Often these attributes increase each time a character gains a level, and a character's level goes up each time the player accumulates a certain amount of experience. <ref>{{cite conference

Role-playing video games also typically attempt to offer more complex and dynamic character interaction than what is found in other video game genres. This usually involves additional focus on the artificial intelligence and scripted behavior of computer-controlled non-player characters. <ref name="fundamentals"/><ref>{{Cite journal

===Story and setting===. 
The premise of most-role-playing games tasks the player with saving the world, or whichever level of society is threatened. There are often twists and turns as the story progresses, such as the surprise appearance of estranged relatives, or enemies who become friends or vice versa. <ref name="fundamentals"/> The game world tends to be set in a [[fantasy]] or [[science fiction]] universe,<ref>[[#AdRol|Adams, Rollings 2003]], p. 351</ref> which allows players to do things they cannot do in real life and helps players suspend their disbelief about the rapid character growth. To a lesser extent, settings closer to the present day or near future are possible. <ref name="fundamentals"/> . 

A strong story often provides half the entertainment in the game. <ref name="fundamentals"/> Because these games have strong storylines, they can often make effective use of recorded dialog and voiceover narration. <ref name="fundamentals"/> Players of these games tend to appreciate long [[cut scene]]s more than players of faster [[action game]]s. <ref name="fundamentals"/> While most games advance the plot when the player defeats an enemy or completes a level, role-playing games often progress the plot based on other important decisions. For example, a player may make the decision to join a guild, thus triggering a progression in the storyline that is usually irreversible. <ref name="fundamentals"/> New elements in the story may also be triggered by mere arrival in an area, rather than completing a specific challenge. <ref name="fundamentals"/> The plot is usually divided so that each game location is an opportunity to reveal a new chapter in the story. <ref name="fundamentals"/> . 

Pen-and-paper [[role-playing games]] typically involve a player called the [[gamemaster]] who can dynamically create the story, setting, and rules, and react to a player's choices. In role-playing video games, the computer performs the function of the gamemaster. This offers the player a smaller set of possible actions, since computers do not yet have the power to engage in imaginative acting comparable to a skilled human gamemaster. Characterization of non-player characters in video games is often handled using a [[dialog tree]]. Saying the right things to the right non-player characters will elicit useful information for the player, and may even result in other rewards such as experience. [[Multiplayer video game|Multiplayer]] [[online game|online]] role-playing games can offer an exception to this contrast by allowing human interaction among multiple players and in some cases enabling a player to perform the role of a gamemaster. <ref name="fundamentals"/><ref>{{Cite book

===Exploration and quests===. 
Exploring the world is an important aspect of all RPGs. <ref name="fundamentals"/> Players will walk through, talking to non-player characters, picking up objects, and avoiding traps. <ref name="fundamentals"/> Some games such as ''[[NetHack]]'', ''[[Diablo (video game)|Diablo]]'', and the FATE series randomize the structure of individual levels, increasing the game's variety and replayability. <ref name="fundamentals"/> Role-playing games where players complete quests by exploring randomly generated dungeons are sometimes called [[roguelike]]s, named after the 1980 video game ''[[Rogue (video game)|Rogue]]''. <ref name="essential">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3123537|title=The Essential 50 Part 12 -- Rogue|last=Parish|first=Jeremy|publisher=1UP|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref> . 

The game's story is often mapped onto exploration, where each chapter of the story is mapped onto a different location. Unlike other [[nonlinear gameplay|linear]] games, RPGs usually allow players to return to previously visited locations. Usually, there is nothing left to do there, although some locations change throughout the story and offer the player new things to do in response. Players must acquire enough power to overcome a major challenge in order to progress to the next area, and this structure can be compared to the [[Boss (video games)|boss]] characters at the end of levels in [[action game]]s. <ref name="fundamentals"/> . 

The player typically must complete a linear sequence of certain quests in order to reach the end of the game's story. However, RPGs also often allow the player to seek out optional side-quests and character interactions. Quests of this sort can be found by talking to a non-player character, and there is no penalty for abandoning or ignoring these quests other than a missed opportunity. <ref name="fundamentals"/> There is usually a reward for completing a side-quest, although quests in some games such as ''[[Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura|Arcanum]]'' or ''[[Geneforge (series)|Geneforge]]'' can limit or enable certain choices later in the game.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Quests may involve defeating one or many enemies, rescuing a non-player character, item fetch quests, or locational puzzles such as mysteriously locked doors. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} . 

===Items and inventory===. 
Players can find loot throughout the game world and collect it, such as clothing, weapons, and armor. <ref name="fundamentals"/> Players can trade items for currency and better equipment. Trade takes place while interacting with certain friendly non-player characters, such as shopkeepers, and often uses a specialized trading screen. Purchased items go into the player's inventory. Some games turn inventory management into a logistical challenge by limiting the size of the player's inventory, thus forcing the player to decide what they must carry at the time. <ref>[[#AdRol|Adams, Rollings 2003]], p. 362</ref> This can be done by limiting the maximum weight that a player can carry, by employing a system of arranging items in a virtual space, or by simply limiting the number of items that can be held. <ref name="fundamentals">{{Harvnb|Adams, Rollings|2006|Ref=adamsrollings_2006}}</ref> . 

===Character actions and abilities===. 
Most of the actions in an RPG are performed indirectly, with the player selecting an action and the character performing it by their own accord. <ref name="fundamentals"/> Success at that action depends on the character's numeric attributes. Role-playing video games often simulate die-rolling mechanics from non-electronic role-playing games, to determine success or failure. As a character's attributes improve, their chances of succeeding at a particular action will increase. <ref name="fundamentals"/> . 

Many role-playing games allow players to play as an evil character. Although robbing and murdering indiscriminately may make it easier to get money, there are usually consequences in that other characters will become uncooperative or even hostile towards the player. Thus, these games allow players to make moral choices, but force players to live with the consequences of their actions. <ref name="fundamentals"/> Games often let the player control an entire party of characters. However, if winning is contingent upon the survival of a single character, then that character effectively becomes the player's [[avatar (computing)|avatar]]. <ref name="fundamentals"/> An example of this would be in ''[[Baldur's Gate]]'', where if the character created by the player dies, the game ends and a previous save needs to be loaded. <ref name="gamespot-bg-review">{{cite web|last=Desslock|title=Baldur's Gate Review|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/baldursgate/review.html|publisher=Gamespot|accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> . 

Although some single-player role-playing games give the player an avatar that is largely predefined for the sake of telling a specific story, many role-playing games make use of a character creation screen. This allows players to choose their character's sex, their race or species, and their character class. Although many of theses traits are cosmetic, there are functional aspects as well. Character classes will have different abilities and strengths. Common classes include fighters, spellcasters, thieves with stealth abilities, and clerics with healing abilities, or a mixed class, such as a fighter who can cast simple spells. Characters will also have a range of physical attributes such as dexterity and strength, which affect a player's performance in combat. Mental attributes such as intelligence may affect a player's ability to perform and learn spells, while social attributes such as charisma may limit the player's choices while conversing with non-player characters. These attribute systems often strongly resemble the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' ruleset. <ref name="fundamentals"/><ref>[[#AdRol|Adams, Rollings 2003]], pp. 358-361</ref><!--The ref is about most of this para--> . 

Role-playing games frequently make use of magical powers, or equivelents such as psychic powers or advanced technology. These abilities are confined to specific characters such as mages, spellcasters, or magic-users. In games where the player controls multiple characters, these magic-users usually complement the physical strength of other classes. Magic can be used as an attack or defense, or to temporarily change an enemy or ally's attributes. While some games allow players to gradually consume a spell, as ammunition is consumed by a gun, most games offer players a finite amount of [[mana]] which can be spent on any spell. Mana is restored by resting, or by consuming potions. Characters can also gain other non-magical skills, which stay with the character as long as he lives. <ref name="fundamentals"/> . 

===Experience and levels===. 
Although the [[characterization]] of the game's avatar will develop through storytelling, characters may also become more functionally powerful by gaining new skills, weapons, and magic. This creates a positive-feedback cycle that is central to most role-playing games: The player grows in power, allowing them to overcome more difficult challenges, and gain even more power. <ref name="fundamentals"/> This is part of the appeal of the genre, where players experience growing from an ordinary person into a superhero with amazing powers. Whereas other games give the player these powers immediately, the player in a role-playing game will choose their powers and skills as they gain experience. <ref name="fundamentals"/> . 

Role-playing games usually measure progress by counting [[experience point]]s and character levels. Experience is usually earned by defeating enemies in combat, with some games offering experience for completing certain quests or conversations. Experience becomes a form of [[score (game)|score]], and accumulating a certain amount of experience will cause the character's level to go up. This is called "levelling up", and gives the player an opportunity to raise one or more of his character's attributes. Many RPGs allow players to choose how to improve their character, by allocating a finite number of points into the attributes of their choice. <ref name="fundamentals"/> Gaining experience will also unlock new magic spells for characters that use magic. <ref name="fundamentals"/> . 

Some role-playing games also give the player specific skill points, which can be used to unlock a new skill or improve an existing one. This may sometimes be implemented as a skill tree. As with the [[technology tree]]s seen in [[strategy video game]]s, learning a particular skill in the tree will unlock more powerful skills deeper in the tree. <ref name="fundamentals"/> . 

Three different systems of rewarding the player characters for solving the tasks in the game can be set apart: the ''experience system ''(also known as the "[[Experience point|level]]-based" system), the ''training system'' (also known as the "skill-based" system) and the ''skill-point system'' (also known as "level-free" system)
* The experience system, by far the most common, was inherited from pen-and-paper role-playing games and emphasizes receiving "[[experience point]]s" (often abbreviated "XP" or "EXP") by winning battles, performing class-specific activities, and completing [[quest (gaming)|quests]]. Once a certain amount of experience is gained, the character advances a level. In some games, level-up occurs automatically when the required amount of experience is reached; in others, the player can choose when and where to advance a level. Likewise, abilities and attributes may increase automatically or manually.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}
* The training system is similar to the way the [[Basic Role-Playing]] system works. The first video game to use this was ''[[Dungeon Master (video game)|Dungeon Master]]'',{{or|date=October 2010}} and emphasizes developing the character's skills by using them—meaning that if a character wields a sword for some time, he or she will become proficient with it.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} . 

===Combat===. 
{{further2|[[Time-keeping systems in games]]}}
[[File:FF3Battle.JPG|thumb|right|Role-playing video games typically make available many kinds of magic and several characters, often in a full [[3D computer graphics|3D]] world. Shown here is a battle in ''[[Final Fantasy III]]'' for the [[Nintendo DS]].]]
Older games often separated combat into its own mode of gameplay, distinct from exploring the game world. More recent games tend to maintain a consistent perspective for exploration and combat. <ref name="fundamentals"/> Some games, especially earlier video games, generate battles from [[random encounter]]s; more modern RPGs are more likely to have persistent [[wandering monster]]s that move about the game world independently of the player. Most RPGs also use stationary [[boss (video games)|boss]] monsters in key positions, and automatically trigger battles with them when the PCs enter these locations or perform certain actions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Combat options typically involve positioning characters, selecting which enemy to attack, and exercising special skills such as casting spells. <ref name="fundamentals"/> . 

In a classical turn-based system, only one character may act at a time; all other characters remain still, with a few exceptions that may involve the use of special abilities. The order in which the characters act is usually dependent on their attributes, such as speed or agility. This system rewards strategic planning more than quickness. It also points to the fact that realism in games is a means to the end of [[immersion (virtual reality)|immersion]] in the game world, not an end in itself. A turn-based system makes it possible, for example, to run within range of an opponent and kill him before he gets a chance to act, or duck out from behind hard cover, fire, and retreat back without an opponent being able to fire, which are of course both impossibilities. However, tactical possibilities have been created by this unreality that did not exist before; the player determines whether the loss of immersion in the reality of the game is worth the satisfaction gained from the development of the tactic and its successful execution. ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'' has been praised as being "the shining example of a good turn-based Combat System{{sic}}". <ref name=actiontrip/> . 

Real-time combat can import features from [[action game]]s, creating a hybrid [[action RPG]] game genre. But other RPG battle systems such as the [[Final Fantasy battle systems]] have imported real-time choices without emphasizing coordination or reflexes. Other systems combine real-time combat with the ability to pause the game and issue orders to all characters under his/her control; when the game is unpaused, all characters follow the orders they were given. This "real-time with pause" system (''RTwP'') has been particularly popular in games designed by [[BioWare]]. The most famous RTwP engine is the [[Infinity Engine]]. Other names for "real-time with pause" include "active pause", "semi real-time"<ref name=actiontrip>{{cite web| last =Babovic | first =Branislav | title =Combat Systems in RPG Games | publisher =ActionTrip | year =2000 | url =http://www.actiontrip.com/features/combatsystemsinrpggames.phtml | accessdate =2007-12-02 }}</ref> and "smart pause".{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} . 

Early ''[[Ultima (series)|Ultima]]'' games featured a RTwP system: they were strictly turn-based, but if the player waited more than a second or so to issue a command, the game would automatically issue a pass command, allowing the monsters to take a turn while the PCs did nothing. ''[[Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel]]'' is another game which used this system. <ref name=actiontrip/> . 

There is a further subdivision by the structure of the battle system; in many early games, such as ''[[Wizardry]]'', monsters and the party are arrayed into ranks, and can only attack enemies in the front rank with melee weapons. Other games, such as most of the ''Ultima'' series, employed duplicates of the miniatures combat system traditionally used in the early [[role-playing game]]s. Representations of the player characters and monsters would move around an arena modeled after the surrounding terrain, attacking any enemies that are sufficiently near.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} . 

===Interface and graphics===. 
Players typically navigate the game world from a first or third-person perspective in 3D RPGs. However, an isometric or aerial top-down perspective is common in party-based RPGs, in order to give the player a clear view of their entire party and their surroundings. <ref>[[#AdRol|Adams, Rollings 2003]], pp. 364-367</ref> Role-playing games require the player to manage a large amount of information, and frequently make use of a windowed interface. For example, spell-casting characters will often have a menu of spells they can use. On the PC, players typically use the mouse to click on icons and menu options, while console games duplicate this functionality with the game controller. Older games often revealed calculations of the game as seen in Dungeons and Dragons games, although more recent games have removed this information to improve immersion. <ref name="fundamentals"/> . 

==History and classification==. 
{{further2|[[History of Western role-playing video games]], [[History of Eastern role-playing video games]], [[List of role-playing video games]]}}
The '''role-playing video game''' [[Video game genres|genre]] began in the mid-1970s on [[mainframe computer]]s, inspired by pen-and-paper [[role-playing game]]s such as ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''. <ref name="barton_3623_01">{{Harvnb|Barton|2007a|p=1|Ref=barton_3623}}</ref> Several other sources of inspiration for early role-playing video games also included tabletop [[Wargaming|wargames]], [[sports simulation]] games, [[adventure game]]s such as ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'', [[fantasy]] writings by authors such as [[J.

After the success of role-playing video games such as ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', the role-playing genre eventually diverged into two styles, ''Japanese role-playing games'' and ''Western role-playing games'', due to [[#Cultural differences|cultural differences]], though roughly mirroring the platform divide between [[Video game console|consoles]] and [[Personal computer|computers]], respectively. <ref name="barton_evw">{{cite web|first=Matt|last=Barton|url=http://armchairarcade.com/neo/node/733 |title=Kawaisa!: A Naive Glance at Western and Eastern RPGs |publisher=Armchair Arcade |date=2010-06-21 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref> Finally, while the first RPGs offered strictly a [[single player]] experience, the popularity of [[multiplayer]] modes rose sharply during the early to mid-1990s with [[action role-playing game]]s such as ''[[Secret of Mana]]'' and ''[[Diablo (video game)|Diablo]]''.  With the advent of the Internet, multiplayer games have grown to become [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s, including ''[[Lineage (video game)|Lineage]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'', and ''[[World of Warcraft]]''.  . 

===Mainframe computers===. 
The role-playing video game genre began in the mid-1970s, as an offshoot of early university [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] text-based RPGs on [[PDP-10]] and [[Unix]]-based computers, such as ''[[Dungeon (video game)|Dungeon]]'', [[pedit5]] and [[dnd (video game)|dnd]]. In [[1980 in video gaming|1980]], a very popular [[dungeon crawl]]er, ''[[Rogue (video game)|Rogue]]'' was released. Featuring [[ASCII]] graphics where the setting, monsters and items were represented by letters and a deep system of gameplay, it inspired a whole genre of similar clones on mainframe and home computers called "[[roguelike]]s".  . 

===Personal computers===. 
{{see also|History of Western role-playing video games}} . 

One of the earliest role-playing video game on a [[microcomputer]] was ''Dungeon n Dragons'', written by Peter Trefonas and published by [[CLOAD]] (1980). This early game, published for a [[TRS-80]] Model 1, was just 16K long and included a limited word parser command line, character generation, a store to purchase equipment, combat, traps to solve, and a dungeon to explore. <ref name="Trefonas, Peter">{{cite web| last = Trefonas | first = Peter | title = Dungeons and Dragons | publisher = [[CLOAD]] | date = May, 1980 | url = http://www.gametronik.com/site/rubriques/tandy/FAQs/CLOAD%20Magazine%201980-05%20(1980)(CLOAD%20Magazine%20Inc).pdf | accessdate = 2010-10-30}}</ref> Other contemporaneous CRPG's (Computer Role Playing Games) were ''[[Temple of Apshai]]'' and ''[[Akalabeth: World of Doom]]'', the precursor to ''[[Ultima (series)|Ultima]]''. Some early microcomputer RPGs (such as ''[[Telengard]]'' or ''[[Sword of Fargoal]]'') were based on their mainframe counterparts, while others (such as ''Ultima'' or ''[[Wizardry]]'', the most successful of the early CRPGs) were direct adaptations of D&D. They also included both first-person displays and overhead views, sometimes in the same game (''Akalabeth'', for example, used both perspectives). Most of the key features of RPGs were developed in this early period, prior to the release of ''[[Ultima III]]'', one of the prime influences on both computer and console RPG development. For example, Wizardry featured menu-driven combat, ''[[Tunnels of Doom]]'' featured tactical combat on a special "combat screen", and ''[[Dungeons of Daggorath]]'' featured real-time combat which took place on the main dungeon map. <ref>{{Harvnb|Barton|2007a|Ref=barton_3623}}</ref> . 

Starting in 1984 with ''[[Questron]]'' and ''[[50 Mission Crush]]'', [[Strategic Simulations, Inc.|SSI]] produced many series of CRPGs. Their 1985 game ''[[Phantasie]]'' is notable for introducing [[automap]]ping and in-game scrolls providing hints and background information. They also released ''[[Pool of Radiance]]'' in 1988, the first of several "[[Gold Box]]" CRPGs based on the ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rules''. These games featured a first-person display for movement, combined with an overhead tactical display for combat. One common feature of RPGs from this era, which [[Matt Barton]] calls the "Golden Age" of computer RPGs, is the use of numbered "paragraphs" printed in the manual or adjunct booklets, containing the game's lengthier texts; the player could be directed to read a certain paragraph, instead of being shown the text on screen. The ultimate exemplar of this approach was [[Sirtech]]'s ''[[Star Saga]]'' trilogy (of which only two games were released); the first game contained 888 "textlets" (usually much longer than a single paragraph) spread across 13 booklets, while the second contained 50,000 paragraphs spread across 14 booklets. Most of the games from this era were turn-based, although ''Dungeon Master'' and its imitators had real-time combat. Other classic titles from this era include ''[[The Bard's Tale (1985 video game)|The Bard's Tale]]'', ''[[Wasteland (video game)|Wasteland]]'', the start of the ''[[Might and Magic]]'' series and the continuing ''[[Ultima (series)|Ultima]]'' series. <ref>{{Harvnb|Barton|2007b|Ref=barton_1706}}</ref> . 

Later, in the middle to late 1990s, isometric, sprite-based RPGs became commonplace, with video game publishers [[Interplay Entertainment]] and [[Blizzard North]] playing a lead role with such titles as ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'', the ''[[Baldur's Gate]]'' and ''[[Icewind Dale]]'' series, and ''[[Diablo (video game)|Diablo]]''. This era also saw a move toward 3D game engines with such games as ''[[Might and Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven]]'' and ''[[The Elder Scrolls I: Arena]]''. TSR, dissatisfied with SSI's later products, such as ''[[Dark Sun: Wake of the Ravager]]'' and ''[[Menzoberranzan]]'', transferred the AD&D license to several different developers, and eventually gave it to [[BioWare]], which used it in ''[[Baldur's Gate]]'' (1998) and several later games. By the 2000s, 3D engines had become dominant. <ref>{{Harvnb|Barton|2007c|Ref=barton_1571}}</ref> . 

===Video game consoles===.

In 1987, the genre came into its own with the release of several highly influential console RPGs distinguishing themselves from computer RPGs. [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]'s ''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link]]'' for the [[Family Computer Disk System|Famicom Disk System]] was one of the earliest [[action role-playing game]]s, combining the [[action-adventure game]] framework of its predecessor ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' with the statistical elements of [[Role-playing battle systems|turn-based RPGs]]. <ref>{{cite web|author=Andrew Vestal|title=The History of Console RPGs - Zelda II: The Adventure of Link|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=1998-11-02|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/rpg_hs/nes6.html|accessdate=2009-09-10}}</ref> Most RPGs at this time were turn-based. <ref name="Iwata Asks: RPG">{{cite web|url=http://dqnine.com/#/iwata/|title=Dragon Quest 9: Sentinels of the Starry Skies|work=Iwata Asks|publisher=Square-Enix|at=Iwata Asks Dragon Quest IX Video 4, As a Turn-based RPG|accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref> ''[[Faxanadu]]'' was another early action RPG for the NES, released as a side-story to the computer action RPG ''[[Dragon Slayer II: Xanadu]]''. <ref name=GameSpot-Other-NES>{{cite web|first=Andrew|last=Vestal|title=The History of Console RPGs: Other NES RPGs|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=1998-11-02|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/rpg_hs/nes5.html|accessdate=2009-09-10}}</ref> [[Square Co.|Square]]'s ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' for the NES introduced side-view battles, with the player characters on the right and the enemies on the left, which soon became the norm for numerous console RPGs. <ref name="gsff1">{{cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/finalfantasy_hs/sec1_1_2.html | title = The History of Final Fantasy - Final Fantasy (Part 2) |first= Andrew|last=Vestal | publisher = Gamespot | date = 1998-11-02 | accessdate = 2008-12-31 }}</ref> In 1988, ''[[Dragon Quest III]]'' introduced a character progression system allowing the player to change the party's character classes during the course of the game.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} Another "major innovation was the introduction of day/night cycles; certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at certain times of day."<ref>{{cite web|author=Andrew Vestal|title=The History of Console RPGs: Dragon Quest III|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=1998-11-02|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/rpg_hs/nes7.html|accessdate=2009-09-10}}</ref> In 1989, ''[[Phantasy Star II]]'' for the [[Mega Drive|Genesis]] established many conventions of the genre, including an [[Epic (story)|epic]], dramatic, character-driven storyline dealing with serious themes and subject matter, and a strategy-based battle system. <ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/features/6129293/index.html The Greatest Games of All Time: Phantasy Star II], [[GameSpot]]</ref> . 

Console RPGs distinguished themselves from computer RPGs to a greater degree in the early 1990s. As console RPGs became more heavily story-based than their computer counterparts, one of the major differences that emerged during this time was in the portrayal of the characters. Console RPGs often featured intricately related characters who had distinctive personalities and traits, with many of them seeming to offer more of the traditional [[role-playing]], with players assuming the roles of people who cared about each other, fell in love or even had families. Romance in particular was a theme that was common in most console RPGs at the time but absent from most computer RPGs. <ref>Neal Hallford & Jana Hallford (2001), [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GslPb621eXQC ''Swords & circuitry: a designer's guide to computer role-playing games''], p. xxiv, [[Cengage Learning]], ISBN 0-7615-3299-4</ref> During the 1990s, console RPGs had become increasingly dominant, exerting a greater influence on computer RPGs than the other way around. <ref name=Gamasutra-12>[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1571/the_history_of_computer_.php?page=12 The History of Computer Role-Playing Games Part III: The Platinum and Modern Ages (1994-2004)] (Page 12), [[Gamasutra]]</ref> Console RPGs had eclipsed computer RPGs for some time, though computer RPGs began making a comeback towards the end of the decade with interactive choice-filled adventures. <ref>Neal Hallford & Jana Hallford (2001), [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GslPb621eXQC ''Swords & circuitry: a designer's guide to computer role-playing games''], pp. xxiv & xxv, [[Cengage Learning]], ISBN 0-7615-3299-4</ref> . 

The next major revolution came in the late 1990s, which saw the rise of [[optical disk]]s in [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|fifth generation]] consoles. The implications for RPGs were enormous—longer, more involved quests, better audio, and [[full-motion video]]. This was first clearly demonstrated in 1997 by the phenomenal success of ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', which is considered one of the most influential games of all time,. <ref name=1UP-FFVII/><ref name="vintage_b"/> With a record-breaking production budget of around $45 million,<ref name=1UP-FFVII>[http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3135727 Final Fantasy VII: The Old Order Passeth], [[1UP.com|1UP]]</ref> the ambitious scope of ''Final Fantasy VII'' raised the possibilities for the genre, with its more expansive world to explore,<ref>{{Harvnb|Loguidice|Barton|2009|p=77|Ref=vintage_log}}</ref> much longer quest, more numerous sidequests,<ref name=1UP-FFVII/> [[Minigames of Final Fantasy|dozens of minigames]], and much higher production values.

After the success of role-playing video games in Japan, the role-playing genre eventually began being classified into two fairly distinct styles since the early 2000s, ''Western role-playing games'' (previously known as ''computer RPGs'') and ''Japanese role-playing games'' or ''JRPGs'' (previously known as ''console RPGs''), due to stylistic, gameplay and/or cultural reasons; with the latter having become popularized and heavily influenced by early Japanese video games such as ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. <ref name="barton_evw"/><ref name="gspot_consolehist_j">{{Harvnb|Vestal|1998a|p="Final Fantasy"|Ref=gspot_consolehist}}</ref><ref name=gspot_consolehist_i>{{Harvnb|Vestal|1998a|p="Other Game Boy RPGs"|Ref=gspot_consolehist}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The original ''Dragon Quest'' game is often cited as the first role-playing video game, though it borrows heavily from the ''[[Wizardry]]'' and ''[[Ultima (series)|Ultima]]'' series.

Though sharing fundamental premises, Western RPGs tend to feature darker graphics, older characters, and a greater focus on [[Open world|roaming freedom]], realism and the underlining game mechanics (e.g. "rules-based" or "system-based"<ref name="joyq_evw"/>); whereas Eastern RPGs tend to feature brighter, [[anime]]-like graphics, younger characters, and a greater focus on tightly-orchestrated, linear storylines with intricate plots (e.g. "story-based"<ref name="joyq_evw"/>). <ref name="barton_evw" /><ref name="hallford_xxiv"/><ref name="kotaku_rpgs">{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Fahey|url=http://kotaku.com/5546807/a-visual-guide-to-the-role+playing-game |title=A Visual Guide To The Role-Playing Game |publisher=Kotaku |date=2010-05-25 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref><ref name="nzg_evw">{{cite web|url=http://nzgamer.com/ps2/features/552/japanese-and-western-rpgs-the-differences.html |last=English|first=Sherrin |title=Japanese and Western RPGs - The Differences |publisher=NZGamer |date= |accessdate=2010-09-10}}</ref><ref name="1up_square_japan" /><ref name="1up_wrpgsdead">{{cite web|last=Joynt|first=Patrick|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&cId=3148996 |title=The Oblivion of Western RPGs: Is the PC RPG Dead? from |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |date=2006-03-29 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref><ref name="gama_suckage">{{cite web|last=Doucet|first=Lars|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/LarsDoucet/20110412/7413/RPGs_and_Suckage.php|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|date=April 12, 2011|title=RPGs and Suckage}}</ref> Further, Western RPGs are more novelistic in style,<ref name=gama_me2>{{cite web|last=Kaiser|first=Rowan|title=Opinion: How Mass Effect challenged my definition of 'RPG'|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/129583/Opinion_How_Mass_Effect_challenged_my_definition_of_RPG.php|publisher=Gamasutra}}</ref> are more likely to allow players to create and customize characters from scratch,<ref name="vintage_d">{{Harvnb|Loguidice|Barton|2009|p=79|Ref=vintage_log}}</ref> and feature extensive dialogue systems ranging from wiki-like keywords (e.g. ''Ultima'') to [[dialogue tree]]s (e.g. ''Planescape: Torment''). <ref>RPG Dialogue Systems | http://www.irontowerstudio.com/forum/index.php?topic=414.0</ref><ref name="gama129583"/> On the other hand, JRPGs tend to be more cinematic in style,<ref name=gama_me2/> limiting players to developing one or more pre-made [[player character]]s, and disallowing the option to create or choose one's own playable characters or make decisions that alter the plot. <ref name="gama_suckage"/>{{#tag:ref|This often gives an impression that JRPGs are similar to [[adventure game]]s. <ref>{{cite news | first = Eric | last = Frederiksen | title = An RPG is not an RPG When it's a JRPG | date = 2010-08-17 | url = http://kombo.com/features/An_RPG_is_not_an_RPG_When_it\'s_a_JRPG/ | work = Kombo.com | accessdate = 2010-09-02}}</ref>|group="Note"}} . 

One reason given for these differences is that many early Japanese console RPGs can be seen as forms of interactive ''[[manga]]'' (Japanese comics) or anime wrapped around Western rule systems at the time. <ref name="gama_conund">{{cite web|last=English|first=Fox|title=The RPG Conundrum|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/FoxEnglish/20110325/6963/The_RPG_Conundrum.php|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=13 May 2011|date=March 25, 2011}}</ref> As a result, Japanese console RPGs differentiated themselves with a stronger focus on scripted narratives and character drama,<ref name="hallford_xxiv">{{citation|title=Neal Hallford & Jana Hallford|year=2001|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GslPb621eXQC|title=Swords & circuitry: a designer's guide to computer role-playing games|page=xxiv|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|isbn=0-7615-3299-4|accessdate=2011-05-16}}</ref> alongside streamlined gameplay. <ref name="gama_conund"/> In recent years, these trends have in turn been adopted by Western RPGs, which have begun moving more towards tightly structured narratives, in addition to moving away from "numbers and rules" in favour of streamlined combat systems similar to action games. <ref name="gama_conund"/><ref name="1up_singlefuture"/> In addition, a large number of Western [[Independent video game development|independent games]] are modelled after Japanese RPGs,<ref>{{cite web|date=April 5, 2011|title=GamersGate Holding Indie 'JRPG' Sale|publisher=GameSetWatch|author=Eric Caoili|url=http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2011/04/gamersgate_holding_indie_jrpg.php|accessdate=2011-05-19}}</ref> especially those of the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit era]], partly due to the ''[[RPG Maker]]'' [[game development tool]]s. <ref name="gama_conund"/> . 

Another oft-cited difference is the prominence or absence of ''[[Cuteness in Japanese culture|kawaisa]]'', or "cuteness", in Japanese culture, and different approaches with respect to character aesthetics. <ref name="barton_evw"/> Western RPGs tend to maintain a serious and gritty tone, with predominantly male protagonists exhibiting overtly masculine physical features and mannerisms. JRPG protagonsists tend to be designed with an emphasis on aesthetic beauty, and even male characters are often [[androgynous]] or ''[[bishōnen]]'' in appearance. JRPGs often have cute (and even comic-relief type) characters or animals, juxtaposed (or clashing) with more mature themes and situations; and many modern JRPGs feature characters designed in the same style as those in [[anime]]. <ref name=vintage_d /> The stylistic differences are often due to differing target audiences: Western RPGs are usually geared primarily towards teenage to adult males, whereas Japanese RPGs are usually intended for a much larger demographic,<ref>{{Harvnb|Barton|2008|p=223|Ref=barton_ddesktops}}</ref> including female audiences. <ref name="nzg_evw" />  . 

Lastly, modern Japanese RPGs are more likely to feature [[turn-based]] battles; while modern Western RPGs are more likely to feature [[Real-time game|real-time]] combat. <ref name="nzg_evw" /><ref name="gama_suckage"/><ref name="gama_primer20"/> In the past, the reverse was often true: real-time [[action role-playing game]]s were far more common among Japanese console RPGs than Western computer RPGs up until the late 1990s, due to [[gamepad]]s usually being better suited to real-time action than the keyboard and mouse. <ref>{{Harvnb|Loguidice|Barton|2009|p=43|Ref=vintage_log}}</ref> There are of course exceptions, such as ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'' (2006) and ''[[Devil Summoner|Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner]]'' (1995 onwards), two Eastern RPGs that feature real-time combat; and ''[[The Temple of Elemental Evil (video game)|The Temple of Elemental Evil]]'' (2003), a Western RPG that features turn-based combat.  .

'''Criticism against Japanese RPGs:''' . 

The earliest criticisms against Japanese RPGs date back to the early 1990s, when they were generally known as console RPGs. In 1994, some within the American computer RPG community argued that cartridge-based Japanese console RPGs "are not role-playing at all" due to many of the popular examples back then, such as ''[[Secret of Mana]]'' and especially ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', using "direct" [[Arcade game|arcade]]-style [[Action game|action]] [[Role-playing battle systems|combat systems]] instead of the more "abstract" [[turn-based]] battle systems associated with table-top RPGs and American computer RPGs of that era. In response, game designer [[Sandy Petersen]] noted that not all console RPGs are action-based, pointing to ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' and ''[[Lufia]]'', and that some computer RPGs such as ''[[Ultima VIII]]'' have also begun following the console trend of adopting arcade action elements. <ref>{{cite journal
|title=Eye of the Monitor|author=Petersen, Sandy|journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]|issue=208|date=August 1994|page=61|authorlink=Sandy Petersen}}</ref> Another criticism at the time, dating back to the ''[[Phantasy Star]]'' games in the late 1980s, was the frequent use of defined [[player character]]s, in contrast to the ''[[Wizardry]]'' and [[Gold Box]] games where the player's [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]] (such as knights, clerics, or thieves) were blank slates. <ref>{{cite web|last=Patterson|first=Eric L.|title=5 WAYS JAPANESE GAMING STILL RULES: ATELIER TOTORI|url=http://www.egmnow.com/articles/news/egm-feature5-ways-japanese-gaming-still-rules-atelier-totori/|work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|accessdate=31 December 2011|date=December 27, 2011}}</ref> . 

In more recent years, some within the RPG community have criticized action JRPGs as not being "true" RPGs for different reasons: heavy usage of scripted [[cut scene]]s and dialogue, and a frequent lack of [[Nonlinear gameplay#Branching storylines|branching]] outcomes. <ref name="GSpy_EastvWest">{{citation | url=http://www.gamespy.com/articles/489/489047p1.html | title=Spy/Counterspy Case File 07: RPGs - East vs. West | last=Turner | first=Benjamin | last2=Nutt | first2=Christian | publisher=[[GameSpy]] | date=2003-07-29 | accessdate=2006-08-14 }}</ref><sup>[Turner]</sup><ref name="vintage_d"/> Japanese RPGs are also sometimes criticized for having relatively simple battle systems in which players are able to win by repetitively mashing buttons,<ref name="GSpy_EastvWest"/><sup>[Turner]</sup> though it has been pointed out that Japanese RPG combat systems such as in ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' and ''[[Xenosaga]]'' have become increasingly complex over the years, with more of an emphasis on strategy and timing, and with each new game often introducing their own rules and systems. <ref name="GSpy_EastvWest"/><sup>[Nutt]</sup><ref name="gamasutra_boyd">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/RobertBoyd/20110113/6784/The_Zeboyd_Games_Approach_to_JRPG_Design.php|title=The Zeboyd Games Approach to JRPG Design|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|author=Robert Boyd|date=2011-01-13|accessdate=2011-05-13}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Though some argue this has not been the case outside of tactical RPGs,<ref name="gama_rpgreboot">{{cite web|last=Doucet|first=Lars|title=Rebooting the RPG|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/LarsDoucet/20110309/7182/Rebooting_the_RPG.php|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=12 May 2011|date=March 9, 2011}}</ref> while others argue that combat systems in Japanese RPGs are too complex or lack accessibility. <ref name="gamasutra_boyd"/>|group="Note"}} As a result, Japanese-style role-playing games are held in disdain by some Western gamers, leading to the term "JRPG" being held in the pejorative. <ref name="gama_primer20"/><ref name="dualshock_kill_biothesda">{{cite web|first=Chad|last=Awkerman|url=http://dualshockers.com/2010/08/05/did-bioware-and-bethesda-kill-the-jrpg/ |title=Did Bioware and Bethesda Kill the JRPG? |publisher=DualShockers |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref>  .

Jeff Fleming of [[Gamasutra]] has pointed out that, while Japanese RPGs on home consoles are generally showing signs of staleness (though with exceptions such as the ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' series and ''[[Demon's Souls]]''), this has not been the case for the [[Nintendo DS]] [[Handheld game console|handheld]], which has had a wave of original and experimental Japanese RPGs released in recent years. <ref name="gsw_whither">{{cite web|last=Fleming|first=Jeff|title=Opinion: 2009 - The Last Days of the Japanese RPG?|url=http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2009/12/opinion_2009_the_last_days_of.php|publisher=GameSetWatch|accessdate=12 May 2011|date=December 30, 2009}}</ref> Finally, in an interview held at the American [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]], Japanese video game developer [[Tetsuya Nomura]] emphasized that role-playing games should not be classified by country-of-origin, but rather described simply for what they are: RPGs. <ref name="1up_ajcult">{{cite web|last=Glasser|first=AJ|title=Editorial: Where culture fits into games|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/216689/editorial-where-culture-fits-into-games/|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=13 May 2011|date=September 24, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100929093616/http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/216689/editorial-where-culture-fits-into-games/|archivedate=2010-09-29}}</ref> And despite criticisms, Japanese RPGs have continued to maintain a large fanbase,<ref name="gama_primer20">{{cite web|last=Kalata|first=Kurt|title=A Japanese RPG Primer: The Essential 20|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3581/a_japanese_rpg_primer_the_.php|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=14 May 2011|date=March 19, 2008}}</ref> and remain a popular source of inspiration for independent developers worldwide. <ref name="gama_conund"/> . 

[[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], creator of ''Final Fantasy'' and ''[[The Last Story]]'', noted that, while "users like to categorise" Japanese RPGs as "turn-based, traditional styles" and Western RPGs as "born from [[first-person shooter|first person shooters]]," there "are titles that don't fit the category," pointing to ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' (which he also worked on) and the ''[[Mana (series)|Mana]]'' games. He further noted that there have been "other games similar to the style of ''Chrono Trigger''," but that "it's probably because the games weren't [[Game localization|localised]] and didn't reach the Western audience."<ref name="metro_sakaguchi">{{cite web|last=Jenkins|first=David|title=The Last Story Hironobu Sakaguchi interview - remaking the JRPG|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/games/891132-the-last-story-hironobu-sakaguchi-interview-remaking-the-rpg|work=[[GameCentral]]|publisher=''[[Metro (British newspaper){{!}}Metro]]''|accessdate=1 March 2012|date=23 February 2012}}</ref> . 

Finally, the largely secular nature of Japanese culture results in heavy usage of themes, symbols, and characters taken from a variety of religions, including [[Christianity]] and Japanese [[Shinto]]. This tends to be problematic when JRPGs are exported to Western countries where the topics of religion and blasphemy remain sensitive, such as the United States. It is not unusual for a JRPG to exhibit elements that would be controversial in the West, such as ''[[Xenogears]]'' or ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'' featuring antagonists that bear similarities to the [[Abrahamic God]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]], respectively;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&cId=3155815 |author=Kalata, Kurt|title=Cultural Differences|publisher=1up.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref> and Nintendo has made efforts in the past to remove references such as these prior to introducing their games into the North American market. <ref name="barton_evw" /> . 

'''Criticism against Western RPGs:''' . 

The earliest criticisms against Western RPGs date back to the late 1980s, when American RPGs were generally known as computer RPGs, while the new Japanese RPGs that were gaining popularity in North America were known as console RPGs. When traditional American computer RPGs such as ''[[Ultima (series)|Ultima]]'' and ''[[Defender of the Crown]]'' were ported to consoles at the time, they received mixed reviews from console gamers, as they were "not perceived, by many of the players, to be as exciting as the Japanese imports," and lacked the [[Arcade game|arcade]] and [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] elements commonly found in Japanese console RPGs at the time. <ref>{{citation|first=Roe R.|last=Adams|work=[[Computer Gaming World]]|year=1990|month=November|issue=76|pages=83–84 [84]|title=Westward Ho! (Toward Japan, That Is): An Overview of the Evolution of CRPGs on Dedicated Game Machines|quote=Last year also saw the coattail effect of traditional bestselling CRPGs being ported over onto dedicated game machines as the new market of machines blossomed into money trees. Games like Ultima, Shadowgate, and Defender of the Crown appeared to mixed reviews. These stalwarts of computer fame were not perceived, by many of the players, to be as exciting as the Japanese imports.}}</ref> In the early 1990s, American computer RPGs also began facing criticism for their plots, where "the party sticks together through thick and thin" and always "act together as a group" rather than as individuals, and where [[non-player character]]s are "one-dimensional characters," in comparison to the more [[fantasy]] [[novel]] approach of [[Squaresoft]] console RPGs such as ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''. <ref name="dragon_ffii">{{cite journal|author=[[Sandy Petersen]]|title=Reviews: Final Fantasy II|journal=[[Dragon (magazine){{!}}Dragon]]|year=1993|month=November|issue=199|pages=56 & 58|url=http://dnd.ezael.net/~olep/Drmg199.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2012}}</ref> . 

As Japanese console RPGs became increasingly more dominant in the 1990s,<ref name="barton_1571_12h">{{Harvnb|Barton|2007c|p=12|Ref=barton_1571}}</ref> and became known for being more heavily story-based and more focused on characterization, American computer RPGs faced criticism for having characters devoid of personality or background, due to representing [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]] which the player uses to interact with the world, in contrast to Japanese console RPGs which depicted intricately related characters who had distinctive personalities and traits. American computer RPGs were thus criticized for lacking "more of the traditional [[role-playing]]" offered by Japanese console RPGs such as ''Final Fantasy'' and ''[[Lufia]]'', which emphasized character interactions, where players assumed the roles of people who cared about each other, fell in love, or had families. <ref name="hallford_xxiv">{{citation|title=Neal Hallford & Jana Hallford|year=2001|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GslPb621eXQC|title=Swords & circuitry: a designer's guide to computer role playing games|page=xxiv|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|isbn=0-7615-3299-4|accessdate=2011-05-16}}</ref> In response, North American computer RPGs began making a comeback towards the end of the 1990s with interactive choice-filled adventures. <ref>{{citation|title=Neal Hallford & Jana Hallford|year=2001|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GslPb621eXQC|title=Swords & circuitry: a designer's guide to computer role playing games|pages=xxiv & xxv|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|isbn=0-7615-3299-4|accessdate=2011-05-16}}</ref> . 

In recent years, some have criticized Western RPGs for "becoming less RPG-like and more [like] true [[action game]]s" due to the "removal of numbers and rules" that make "the genre an RPG."<ref name="gama_conund"/> Christian Nutt of ''GameSpy'' has also stated that, in contrast to Japanese RPGs, Western RPGs' greater control over the development and customization of playable characters has come at the expense of plot and gameplay, resulting in generic dialogue, lack of character development within the narrative, and poor battle systems. <ref name="GSpy_EastvWest"/><sup>[Nutt]</sup> It has also been argued that Western RPGs tend to focus more on the underlying rules governing the battle system rather than on the experience itself, and that Western RPGs as a whole are generally not as finely tuned and polished as their Japanese counterparts. <ref name="GSpy_EastvWest"/><sup>[Nutt]</sup> Lastly, Tom Battey of ''Edge Magazine'' noted that the problems often cited against Japanese RPGs (mentioned above) also often apply to many Western RPGs as well as games outside of the RPG genre. <ref name="nextgen_fixjrpgs" /> . 

It is not uncommon for Western RPGs to be called "crap games" by players in Japan,<ref name="1up_square_japan">{{cite web|first=Ryan|last=Winterhalter|url=http://www.1up.com/news/square-enix-devs-discuss-secret |title=Square Enix Devs Discuss Secret AAA Title and What They've Learned From the West |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |date=2010-09-06 |accessdate=2010-09-10}}</ref> where the vast majority of console role-playing video games originate,<ref name="gspot_consolehist_h">{{Harvnb|Vestal|1998a|p="The First Console RPG"|Ref=gspot_consolehist}} "A devoted gamer could make a decent case for either of these Atari titles founding the RPG genre; nevertheless, there's no denying that Dragon Quest was the primary catalyst for the Japanese console RPG industry.

Some writers such as Rowan Kaiser of [[Joystiq]] argue that many of the often mentioned differences between Eastern and Western games are [[stereotype]]s that are generally not true for many games. Kaiser makes the case by pointing to the similarities between several Western tiles (such as ''[[Lands of Lore series|Lands of Lore]]'', ''[[Betrayal at Krondor]]'', and ''[[Dragon Age]]'') to several Eastern titles (such as ''Final Fantasy'' and ''Phantasy Star''), noting that these Western titles share a similar emphasis on linear storytelling, as well as, in some cases, "bright-colored" graphics. <ref name="joyq_evw">{{cite web|last=Kaiser|first=Rowan|title=East Is West: How Two Classic RPGs Prove the Stereotypes False|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2012/02/16/east-is-west-how-two-classic-rpgs-prove-the-stereotypes-false/|publisher=[[Joystiq]]|accessdate=19 February 2012|date=February 16, 2012}}</ref> . 

===Relationship to other genres===. 
Unlike [[action game]]s, RPGs seldom test a player's physical skill. Combat is typically a tactical challenge rather than a physical one, and games involve other non-action gameplay such as choosing dialog options, inventory management, or buying and selling items. <ref name="fundamentals"/> . 

Although RPGs share some combat rules with [[Wargame (video games)|wargames]], RPGs are about a small group of individual characters. <ref name="gama129583">{{cite web | last =Kaiser | first =Rowan | title =How Mass Effect challenged my definition of 'RPG' | publisher =[[Gamasutra]] | date =March 1, 2012 | url =http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/129583/Opinion_How_Mass_Effect_challenged_my_definition_of_RPG.php | accessdate = 2012-03-02}}</ref> Wargames tend to have large groups of identical units, as well as non-humanoid units such as tanks and airplanes. Role-playing games do not normally allow the player to produce more units. However, the ''[[Heroes of Might and Magic]]'' series crosses these genres by combining individual heroes with large amounts of troops in large battles. <ref name="fundamentals"/> . 

RPGs rival [[adventure game]]s in terms of their rich storylines, in contrast to genres that do not rely upon storytelling such as [[sports game]]s or [[puzzle game]]s. <ref name="fundamentals"/> Both genres also feature highly detailed characters, and a great deal of exploration. However, adventure games usually have a well-defined character, whereas while RPGs may do so, many allow the player to design their characters. Adventure games usually focus on one character, whereas RPGs often feature an entire party. RPGs also feature a combat system, which adventure games usually lack. Whereas both adventure games and RPGs may focus on the personal or psychological growth of characters, RPGs tend to emphasize a complex eternal economy where characters are defined by increasing numerical attributes.  . 

Gameplay elements strongly associated with this genre, such as statistical character development, have been widely adapted to other video game genres. For example, ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', an [[Action-adventure game]], uses resource statistics (abbreviated as "stats") to define a wide range of attributes including stamina, weapon proficiency, driving, lung capacity, and muscle tone, and uses numerous [[cutscenes]] and [[quests]] to advance the story. ''[[Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos]]'', a [[real-time strategy]] game, features heroes that can complete quests, obtain new equipment, and "learn" new abilities as they advance in level.  . 

According to [[Satoru Iwata]], president of [[Nintendo]], turn-based RPGs have been unfairly criticized as being outdated. According to [[Yuji Horii]], creator of the popular ''Dragon Quest'' series and Ryutaro Ichimura, producer of [[Square Enix]], turn-based RPGs allow the player time to make decisions without feeling rushed or worry about real-life distractions. According to Iwata, action-based RPGs can frustrate players if they are unable to keep up with the battles. <ref name="Iwata Asks: RPG"/> . 

====Action RPGs====. 
{{main|Action role-playing game}} . 

Typically action RPGs feature each player directly controlling a single character in real time, and feature a strong focus on combat and action with plot and character interaction kept to a minimum. Early action RPGs tended to follow the template set by 1980s [[Nihon Falcom]] titles such as the ''[[Dragon Slayer]]'' and ''[[Ys (series)|Ys]]'' series, which feature [[hack and slash]] combat where the [[player character]]'s movements and actions are controlled directly, using a [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] or [[game controller]], rather than using menus. <ref name="kat_hackandslash">{{cite web | last = Bailey | first = Kat | title = Hack and Slash: What Makes a Good Action RPG? | publisher = [[1UP.com]] | date = May 18, 2010 | url = http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=9030743 | accessdate = 2011-07-11}}</ref> This formula was refined by the [[action-adventure game]], ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' (1986), which set the template used by many subsequent action RPGs, including innovations such as an [[open world]], [[nonlinear gameplay]], battery backup [[Saved game|saving]],<ref>{{cite web|title=15 Most Influential Games of All Time: The Legend of Zelda|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/15influential/p9_01.html|accessdate=2010-01-24}}</ref> and an attack button that animates a sword swing or projectile attack on the screen. <ref name=Dragon-Slayer>Kurt Kalata, [http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/dragonslayer/dragonslayer.htm Dragon Slayer], Hardcore Gaming 101</ref><ref name=Hydlide>{{cite web|title=Hydlide|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/hydlide/hydlide.htm|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|last=Kalata|first=Kurt|last2=Greene|first2=Robert}}</ref> The game was largely responsible for the surge of action-oriented RPGs released since the late 1980s, both in Japan and North America. <ref name=Barton>{{Cite book|first=Matt|last=Barton|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IMXu61GbTqMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Dungeons & Desktops: The History of Computer Role-Playing Games |publisher=[[A K Peters, Ltd.]] |year=2008 |accessdate=2010-09-08 |isbn = 1-56881-411-9 | pages=182 & 212}}</ref> [[The Legend of Zelda|''The Legend of Zelda'' series]] would continue to exert an influence on the transition of both console and computer RPGs from stat-heavy, turn-based combat towards real-time action combat in the following decades. <ref>{{citation|title=Vintage Games: An Insider Look at the History of Grand Theft Auto, Super Mario, and the Most Influential Games of All Time|first=Bill|last=Loguidice|first2=Matt|last2=Barton|publisher=[[Focal Press]]|year=2009|isbn=0-240-81146-1|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M_bFdsP9L7oC|page=317}}</ref> . 

A different variation of the action RPG formula was popularized by ''[[Diablo (video game)|Diablo]]'' (1996), where the majority of commands—such as moving and attacking—are executed using [[Point and click|mouse clicks]] rather than via menus, though learned spells can also be assigned to hotkeys. In many action RPGs, [[non-player character]]s serve only one purpose, be it to buy or sell items or upgrade the player's abilities, or issue them with combat-centric quests. Problems players face also often have an action-based solution, such as breaking a wooden door open with an axe rather than finding the key needed to unlock it, though some games place greater emphasis on character attributes such as a "lockpicking" skill and puzzle-solving.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} . 

One common challenge in developing action RPGs is including content beyond that of killing enemies. With the sheer number of items, locations and monsters found in many such games, it can be difficult to create the needed depth to offer players a unique experience tailored to his or her beliefs, choices or actions. <ref name="kat_hackandslash"/> This is doubly true if a game makes use of randomization, as is common. One notable example of a game which went beyond this is ''[[Deus Ex]]'' (2000) which offered multiple solutions to problems using intricately layered story options and individually constructed environments. <ref name="kat_hackandslash"/> Instead of simply bashing their way through levels, players were challenged to act in character by choosing dialog options appropriately, and by using the surrounding environment intelligently. This produced an experience that was unique and tailored to each situation as opposed to one that repeated itself endlessly. <ref name="kat_hackandslash"/> . 

Action RPGs were much more common on consoles rather than computers. <ref name="barton_43"/> Though there had been attempts at creating action-oriented computer RPGs during the late 1980s and early 1990s, often in the vein of ''[[The Legend of Zelda|Zelda]]'', very few saw any success, with the 1992 game ''[[Ultima VII]]'' being one of the more successful attempts in North America. <ref name="barton_43">{{citation|title=Vintage Games: An Insider Look at the History of Grand Theft Auto, Super Mario, and the Most Influential Games of All Time|first=Bill|last=Loguidice|first2=Matt|last2=Barton|publisher=[[Focal Press]]|year=2009|isbn=0-240-81146-1|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M_bFdsP9L7oC| page=43}}</ref> On the PC, ''Diablo''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s effect on the market was significant from the late 1990s.

Soon, driven by the mainstream adoption of the Internet, these parallel trends merged in the popularization of [[graphical MUD]]s, which would soon become known as [[massively multiplayer online role-playing games]] or MMORPGs,<ref name="synthworlds">{{Cite book| last = Castronova | first = Edward | authorlink = Edward Castronova | title = Synthetic Worlds: The Business and Culture of Online Games | publisher = University Of Chicago Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-226-09627-0 | pages = 10, 291 | quote = [pp. 10] The ancestors of MMORPGS were text-based multiuser domains (MUDs) [...] [pp. 291] Indeed, MUDs generate perhaps the one historical connection between game-based VR and the traditional program [...]}}</ref><ref name="berkshire_encyc">{{Cite book| last = Bainbridge | first = William Sims | authorlink = William Sims Bainbridge | title = Berkshire Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction | publisher = Berkshire Publishing Group | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-9743091-2-5 | volume = 3 | page = 474 | quote = Developers had long considered writing a graphical MUD. [...] the last major 2D virtual environment in the West marked the true beginning of the fifth age of MUDs: Origin Systems' 1997 Ultima Online (UO).}}</ref> beginning with games like ''[[Meridian 59]]'' (1995), ''[[Ultima Online]]'' (1997) and ''[[EverQuest]]'' (1999) and leading to modern phenomena such as ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'' (2003), ''[[EVE online]]'' (2003) and ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' (2004).  . 

Though superficially similar, MMORPGs lend their appeal more to the socializing influences of being online with hundreds or even thousands of other players at a time, and trace their origins more from MUDs than from CRPGs like ''Ultima'' and ''Wizardry''. Rather than focusing on the "old school" considerations of memorizing huge numbers of stats and esoterica and battling it out in complex, tactical environments, players instead spend much of their time forming and maintaining guilds and [[Clan (computer gaming)|clans]]. The distinction between CRPGs and MMORPGs and MUDs can as a result be very sharp, likenable to the difference between "attending a [[renaissance fair]] and reading a good fantasy novel". <ref name="barton_1571_12h"/> . 

Further, MMORPGs have been criticized for diluting the "epic" feeling of single-player RPGs and related media among thousands of concurrent adventurers. Stated simply: every player wants to be "The Hero", slay "The Monster", rescue "The Princess", or obtain "The Magic Sword". But when there are thousands of players all playing the same game, clearly not everyone can be ''the'' hero. <ref name="borlanddd_d">{{Harvnb|King|Borland|2003|pp=255–257|Ref=borlanddd}} "Thousands of players have gathered online in massively multiplayer worlds, but that meant that thousands of people might be vying for the status of hero. Too many heroes mean that nobody, or only the few, can be special. Fighting even the most dangerous of monsters gives less of an epic thrill when it is clear that it will simply regenerate after you have killed it, and when 13 parties of adventurers are waiting behind you in line for their turn. There is only one Frodo in the ''Lord of the Rings'', one Avatar in the land of Brittania."</ref> This problem became obvious to some in the game ''EverQuest'', where groups of players would compete and sometimes harass each other in order to get monsters in the same dungeon to drop valuable items, leading to several undesirable behaviors such as [[kill stealing]], [[spawn camping]], and [[ninja looting]]. <ref>{{cite web | last = MacLellan | first = Jon | title = Please?

Lastly, there exist markets such as Korea and China that, while saturated with MMORPGs, have so far proved relatively unreceptive to single-player RPGs. <ref name="1up_singlefuture" /> For instance, Internet-connected personal computers are relatively common in Korea when compared to other regions—particularly in the numerous "[[PC bang]]s" scattered around the country where patrons are able to pay to play multiplayer video games—possibly due to historical bans on Japanese imports, as well as a culture that traditionally sees video games as "frivolous toys" and computers as educational. <ref name="stewartchoi">{{Cite journal | last = Stewart | first = K. | last2 = Choi | first2 = HP | title = PC-Bang (Room) Culture: A Study of Korean College Students' Private and Public Use of Computers and the Internet | journal = Trends in Communication | page = 65 | year = 2003 | url = http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3958007063689222609&hl=en&as_sdt=800000&sciodt=800000 | accessdate = 2010-10-12}}</ref> As a result, some wonder whether the stand-alone, single-player RPG is still viable commercially—especially on the personal computer—when there are competing pressures such as big-name publishers' marketing needs, video game piracy, a change in culture, and the competitive price-point-to-processing-power ratio (at least initially) of modern console systems. <ref name="1up_singlefuture">{{cite web | last = Wilson | first = Jason | title = The Future of Single-Player RPGs | publisher = [[1UP.com]] | date = December 30, 2009 | url = http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3176786 | accessdate = 2010-10-02}}</ref><ref name="barton_1571_12h" /><ref name="1up_chasing">{{cite web | last = Crigger | first = Lara | title = Chasing D&D: A History of RPGs | publisher = [[1UP.com]] | year = 2008 | url = http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3168091 | accessdate = 2010-11-09}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Though things like [[downloadable content]] can stem piracy to some degree, and MMO and single-player RPGs may to some degree attract different audiences—and thus not interfere with each other financially. <ref name="1up_singlefuture" /><ref name="barton_1571_12h" /><ref name="1up_chasing" />|group="Note"}} . 

====Hybrid genres====. 
Finally, a steadily increasing number of other non-RPG video games have adopted aspects traditionally seen in RPGs, such as experience point systems, equipment management, and choices in dialogue, as developers push to fill the demand for role-playing elements in non-RPGs. <ref name="1up_singlefuture" /><ref name="rampcoy_hybrids">{{cite web | title = Are Hybrid RPGs Just Poor-Man's RPGs? | publisher = Tales of the Rampant Coyote | date = October 23, 2006 | url = http://rampantgames.com/blog/2006/10/are-hybrid-rpgs-just-poor-mans-rpgs.html | accessdate = 2010-10-02 | quote = The core elements of a computer roleplaying game are pretty simple and straightforward.

Hybrid RPG can emphasize some other element of gameplay that are FAR less development-intensive than pure roleplaying games. Thus they are cheaper and easier to make. Does this make them the "poor-man's RPG?" Meaning a poor / inexpensive substitution for the real thing? (...) Maybe.}}</ref> The blending of these elements with a number of different [[game engine]]s and [[gameplay]] styles have created a myriad of hybrid game categories formed by mixing popular gameplay elements featured in other genres such as [[first-person shooter]]s, [[platformer]]s, and [[turn-based strategy|turn-based]] and [[real-time strategy]] games. Examples include first-person shooters such as parts of the ''[[Deus Ex (series)|Deus Ex]]'' (starting in 2000) and ''[[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl|S.T.A.L.K.E.R.]]'' (starting in 2007) series;<ref name="bitt_deusex">{{cite web | last = Martin | first = Joe | title = Spector tried to buy Deus Ex rights | publisher = bit-tech.net | date = November 3, 2009 | url = http://www.bit-tech.net/news/gaming/2009/11/03/spector-tried-to-buy-deus-ex-rights/1 | accessdate = 2010-10-02 | quote=Deus Ex, often considered one of the best PC games ever made, is a FPS/RPG hybrid about uncovering an international conspiracy in a near-future, cyber-punk setting.}}</ref><ref name="rpgamer_deusex">{{cite web | last = Boske | first = John | title = Deus Ex: Invisible War - We Wanted Orange, We Got Lemon-Lime | publisher = [[RPGamer]] | url = http://www.rpgamer.com/games/deus/deusex2/reviews/deusex2strev1.html | accessdate = 2010-10-02 | quote=How do you beat your own record?
