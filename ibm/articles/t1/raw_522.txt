{{Video Games}} . 

A '''console game''' is a form of interactive [[multimedia]] used for entertainment. The game consists of manipulable images (and usually sounds) generated by a [[video game console]], and displayed on a [[television]] or similar audio-video system. The game itself is usually controlled and manipulated using a handheld device connected to the console called a [[Game controller|controller]]. The controller generally contains a number of buttons and directional controls (such as [[joysticks|analog joysticks]]) each of which has been assigned a purpose for interacting with and controlling the images on the screen. The display, speakers, console, and controls of a console can also be incorporated into one small object known as a [[handheld game console]].  . 

Game [[multimedia]] usually comes in the form of a [[compact disc|disc]], which can be inserted into the game console. Recent advances have allowed games and [[game demo]]s to be downloaded directly to the console via the [[Internet]]. Simpler consoles, however, may only have a fixed selection of [[built-in]] games. Cartridges were previously common storage devices for video game data, but due to technological advances, most [[video game]]s are now stored on [[Compact Disc|CD]]s, or higher capacity [[DVD]]s, or the [[Blu-ray Disc]] used by the [[PlayStation 3]]. The only games stored on cartridges now are the ones on the [[Nintendo DS]], and they are called "cards".  . 

==Introduction==. 
[[Video game]]s generally each contain different gameplay, objectives, goals, control-schemes, characters, and other features. Each game is usually contained on a specifically designed [[multimedia]] [[Optical disc|disc]] or [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]], which are generally sold separately from the console and each other. In order to play the specific game, you need the specific console for which it was designed. For example, in order to play ''[[Halo: Reach]]'', you need to use an [[Xbox 360]] and to play ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves|Uncharted 2]]'' you need to use a [[PlayStation 3]].  . 

==Console and display==. 
===Controllers===. 
{{main|Game controller}}
The different consoles each use different controllers. Controllers are input devices used to interact with the game. So, for example, if you had a game in which you must control a character in order to obtain a red [[apple]], you would be able to use an analog stick or directional pad ("D Pad") to move your character towards the apple to collect it. Actions buttons, such as "x" on the PS3, will be used to pick up the red apple. Video games, of course, are usually much more complicated than this. In the game ''[[Pikmin]]'' for the Nintendo GameCube, the player uses the analog stick to control his character, the "C" analog stick to tell his [[Pikmin (series)|Pikmin]] what to do or where to go, and the "A" button to throw the Pikmin.  . 

===Screen===. 
Games require a screen of some sort. In the case of normal consoles, a television is the most common form of screen used. The screen is used as a source of visual output. As the player pushes buttons and moves analogs on the controller, the screen responds to the actions and changes take place on the screen, simulating actual movement.  . 

Consoles use a large sized (albeit low-resolution) television as their visual output device: optimal for viewing at a greater distance by a larger audience. As a result, many video games are designed for local [[multiplayer]] play, with all players viewing the same TV set, with the screen divided into several sections and each player using a different controller.  . 

Video games have generally had access to less computing power, less flexible computing power, and lower resolution displays. Dedicated consoles were advanced graphically, especially in animation. This is because video game consoles had dedicated graphics hardware, were able to load data instantly from [[read only memory|ROM]], and a low resolution output would look better on a [[television]] because it naturally blurs the pixels.  . 

==Ratings and censorship==. 
{{see also|Video game#Ratings and censorship}}
Several systems exist world-wide to regulate or censor the video games industry. Some, like the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB) are composed of members of the industry themselves, while others, like [[Pan European Game Information]] (PEGI), are government-backed.  . 

==Criticism==. 
{{See also|Video game controversy}}
From time to time, video games have been criticized by parents' groups, psychologists, politicians, and some religious organizations for allegedly glorifying [[violence]], [[cruelty]], and [[crime]] and exposing children to these elements. It is particularly disturbing to some that some video games allow children to act out crimes (for example, the ''[[Grand Theft Auto (series)|Grand Theft Auto]]'' series), and reward them for doing so. Concerns that children who play violent video games may have a tendency to act more aggressively on the playground have led to voluntary rating systems adopted by the industry, such as the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] rating system in the United States and the [[Pan European Game Information|PEGI]] rating system in Europe (see above), that are aimed at educating parents about the types of games their children should or should not be playing.  . 

Most studies, however, reach the conclusion that violence in video games is not causally linked with aggressive tendencies. This was the conclusion of a 1999  study by the U.S. government, prompting [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[David Satcher]] to say, “...we clearly associate media violence to aggressive behavior, but the impact was very small compared to other things. Some may not be happy with that, but that’s where the science is.”<ref>{{cite news|last=Wright|first=Brad|title=Sounding the alarm on video game ratings|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2002-12-19/tech/games.ratings_1_game-industry-violent-games-entertainment-software-ratings-board?_s=PM:TECH|accessdate=23 November 2011|newspaper=CNN|date=18 February 2004}}</ref>  This was also the conclusion of a [[meta-analysis]] by [[psychologist]] Jonathan Freedman, who reviewed over 200 published studies and found that the majority did not find a causal link. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Freedman|first=Jonathan|title=Effect of television violence on aggressiveness.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1984|month=September|volume=96 (2)|pages=227–246|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.96.2.227|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/96/2/227/}}</ref> .
