'''''Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association''''' (formerly titled as '''''Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Association''''')<ref>[[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], who was the Governor of California leading the appeal of a lower court decision, was succeeded by [[Jerry Brown]] as this case was pending. </ref> is a landmark [[Supreme Court of the United States]] case that struck down a [[California]] law enacted in 2005 that bans the sale of certain violent [[video game]]s to children without parental supervision. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediacoalition.org/VSDA-v.-Schwarzenegger- |title=Schwarzenegger v. EMA |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-10-02 |publisher=mediacoalition.org}}</ref> In a 7-2 decision, the Court upheld the lower court decisions and revoked the law, ruling that video games were protected speech under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] as other forms of media. <ref name=finalruling/> . 

California Senator [[Leland Yee]] introduced the original law in 2005, believing a connection between violent video games and aggressive behavior in children, and sought to regulate the voluntary video game industry ratings review system, the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]]. Though similar laws were passed in other States, they were challenged by video game industry groups like the [[Entertainment Software Association]], and defeated in lower courts. The California law was similarly blocked and ruled unconstitutional in lower courts, but then-California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] continued to take the case to the Supreme Court in 2009, which the Court accepted. Oral arguments were heard in November 2010, with the decision announced in June 2011.   . 

Though the ruling was seen as a victory for the video game industry to classify their products as protected works as with films, books, and television, both concurring and dissenting opinions from the Court suggested that the issue may need to be re-examined in future case law, considering the disparate community standards treatment of violence compared to pornography, and the changing nature of video games with continually improving technology. Some video game analysts have seen the Court's decision as a wake-up call for the industry to mature in light of the Court's opinions. Senator Yee and other state lawmakers have stated they will continue to seek a means to regulate video game sales to minors within the context of the Court's decision.  . 

==Background==. 
{{main|Video game controversy#Crime and violence|l1=Connection between video games and crime and violence}}
Many video games, as early as 1976's ''[[Death Race (1976 game)|Death Race]]'',<ref name="wired history">{{cite web | url  =http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2007/10/how-protests-ag/ | title = How Protests Against Games Cause Them To Sell More Copies | first = Chris | last=  Kohler |date = 2007-10-30 | accessdate = 2011-06-28 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref> incorporate some aspect of violence into the gameplay mechanic, such as killing an enemy with a weapon, using explosives to destroy a structure, or engaging in dangerous vehicle races.  With modern technology, representations of such violence have become more realistic.  This has led to concerns that minors that play such video games will become influenced by the violence, altering their real-life behavior. Academic studies have attempted to find a connection between violent video games and the rate of violence and crimes from those that play them; some have stated a connection exists,<ref name="Effects on aggressive behaviour">Anderson, C.A., & Bushman, B.J.

[[File:ESRBrating.PNG|thumb|left|A typical ESRB rating label will identify the appropriate age group and specific content descriptors for each rated game.]]
To counteract these increasing complaints and attempts at legislation, the video game industry in the United States created the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB) in 1994. <ref>{{cite web | url  = http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2011-06-28-video-game-ratings_n.htm | title = Game industry put focus on ratings years ago | first = Mike | last = Snider | date = 2011-06-28 | accessdate = 2011-06-28 | work = [[USA Today]] }}</ref>  The ESRB, like the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]'s rating system, is a voluntary and self-regulated body that examines the content of video games as provided by the publisher before distribution, and given a rating describing the content within, generally classified from being all ages-appropriate to adult audiences only. Video game distributors are similar bound by voluntary compliance to check the age of the purchaser against the rating of the game to prevent the sale of mature titles to younger players. Most stores prevent the sale of unrated games, and as such, virtually every video game sold at retail in the United States is rated by the ESRB. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.esrb.org/ratings/faq.jsp#1 | title = ESRB Frequently Asked Questions | publisher = [[ESRB]] | accessdate = 2011-06-28 }}</ref> Attempts have been made to mandate the ratings system; the [[Family Entertainment Protection Act]], a 2005 bill introduced into the U.S. Congress by Senators [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Joseph Lieberman]], and [[Evan Bayh]], would have made ESRB participation mandatory with oversight by the Federal Trade Commission, and introduced fines for selling Mature or Adult-Only content to minors. The bill, however, did not clear the Senate. Though the ESRB met criticism in 2000-2005 for the ease of access of mature-rated games to minors, the Board has improved its efforts to enforce the ratings system at retailers. A 2011 report issued by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] found that the voluntary controls by the ESRB had the highest success rate of any other media industry, preventing sales of mature titles to minors 87% of the time. <ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2011/04/violentkidsent.shtm | title = FTC Undercover Shopper Survey on Enforcement of Entertainment Ratings Finds Compliance Worst for Retailers of Music CDs and the Highest Among Video Game Sellers | date = 2011-04-20 | accessdate = 2011-06-28 | publisher = [[Federal Trade Commission]] }}</ref> Similar content rating systems exist in other countries, including the [[British Board of Film Classification]], the [[Australian Classification Board]], and Japan's [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization]].  . 

==The California law==. 
[[File:Leland Yee.jpg|right|thumb|upright|California Senator [[Leland Yee]] introduced CA Law AB 1179, the law debated in the case.]]
In 2005, the [[California State Legislature]] passed AB 1179, sponsored by [[California State Senator]] [[Leland Yee]], which banned the sale of violent video games to anyone under age 18 and required clear labeling beyond the existing ESRB rating system.  The law would have a maximum $1000 fine for each infraction. The definition of "violent video game" used a variation of the [[Miller test]], a three-pronged test used previously by the [[United States Supreme Court]] to define when speech is not protected under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. <ref name="gamasutra analysis">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6191/video_game_regulation_and_the_.php | title = Video Game Regulation and the Supreme Court: Schwarzenegger v.

The law was a second attempt by Senator Yee to enact restrictions for video game sales to minors. Yee's background as a [[child psychologist]] led him to assert there was a connection between video games and violence and believed that the government had strong interest in restricting video game sales to minors as was already done for pornographic works. <ref>{{Cite news | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/29/business/la-fi-ct-facetime-20100429 | title= Lawmaker defends law banning sale of violent video games to minors | date = 2010-04-10 | accessdate=  2010-11-02 | first = Ben | last = Fritz | work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> In 2004, Yee had drafted a law that would have required mature-rated video games to be stocked separately from other titles. Though the bill ultimately passed as [[California Assembly Bills 1792 & 1793|CA Law AB 1793]], the bill's language was diluted at its passage, only requiring stores to display the ESRB ratings system and provide information to parents about it. <ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=4324 | title = Schwarzenegger Signs California Video Games Bill | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | date = 2004-09-22 | accessdate=  2010-11-02 | first =David | last = Jenkins | first2= Simon | last2= Carless }}</ref> . 

==Legal challenges==. 
===The District Court Opinion===. 
Even before the California bill was signed into law, the ESA and the Video Software Dealers Association (VSDA), now known as the [[Entertainment Merchants Association]] (EMA), were preparing a lawsuit to overturn the law, fearing that the "violent video game" definition would affect many titles that the ESRB has otherwise labeled appropriate for younger players, and threaten to harm the video game industry. <ref name="gamespot signed"/> The VSDA filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] and was later joined by the ESA. The two groups succeeded in obtaining a preliminary injunction in December 2005 to block enforcement of the law during the case; U.S. District Judge [[Ronald M. Whyte]] cited in his preliminary decision: "The plaintiffs have shown at least that serious questions are raised concerning the States' ability to restrict minors' First Amendment rights in connection with exposure to violent video games, including the question of whether there is a causal connection between access to such games and psychological or other harm to children."<ref name="arstech injunction">{{cite web | url = http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2005/12/5825.ars  | title = California game law blocked | first = Ken | last = Fisher | date = 2005-12-22 | accessdate= 2010-11-01 | publisher = [[Ars Technica]] }}</ref> In August 2007, Whyte ultimately ruled for the plaintiffs, holding that the law violated the First Amendment, and that there was an insufficient showing of proof that either video games differed from other media or that there was established causality between violent video games and violent behavior. <ref name="NDCalifDecision">{{Cite court|litigants=Video Software Dealers Ass'n, et al. v. Schwarzenegger, et al. |vol=2007 |reporter=U.S. Dist. LEXIS |opinion=57472 |pinpoint= |court=N.D. Cal. |date=2007 |url= |quote=}}</ref> . 

The court first addressed the VSDA's argument that the entire Act should be invalidated based on the defendant's concession on appeal that the definition of "violent video game" in the statute is unconstitutionally broad. However, the statute has a [[severability clause]]<ref>California Civil Code § 1746.5. </ref> so the court runs through the test for severability set forth in ''Hotel Employees & Rest. Employees Int'l Union v. Davis''. <ref>{{cite court |litigants=Hotel Employees & Rest. Employees Int'l Union v. Superior Court |vol=35 |reporter=Cal. 4th |opinion=935 |pinpoint= |court= |date=2005 |url= |quote=}}</ref> The court held that definition for "violent video game" is grammatically and functionally separable because, as an alternative definition of "violent video game," it can be removed from the Act without affecting the wording or function of the Act's other provisions. <ref name="Schwarzenegger Ninth" /> Further, the definitions are volitionally separable because those sections were not of critical importance to passage of the act and the legislative body would have adopted the act had it foreseen the partial invalidation of the statute. <ref>{{cite court |litigants=Sonoma County Org.  of Pub. Employees v. County of Sonoma |vol=23 |reporter=Cal. 3d |opinion=296 |pinpoint= |court= |date=1979 |url= |quote=}}</ref> These definition sections were only included to try and avoid the a court ruling them unconstitutionally vague so the legislature would still have enacted the statues without the definition section. <ref name="Schwarzenegger Ninth" /> . 

The court next went on to determine what level of scrutiny should be applied in reviewing the Act's Prohibitions. The defendants insisted that the "variable obscenity" standard from ''Ginsberg v. New York'' should be used. <ref name="Ginsberg" /> However, the court held that the "variable obscenity" standard does not apply to violence. The Court in ''Ginsberg'' was careful to place substantive limits on its holding, and concern in ''Ginsberg'' is only "sex material" not violence. The court declined to extend the application of the "variable obscenity" standard to violence, so strict scrutiny will be applied. <ref name="Schwarzenegger Ninth" /><br>
In applying strict scrutiny the court recognized that "content-based regulations are presumptively invalid,"<ref>{{cite court |litigants=R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, Minnesota |vol=505 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=377 |pinpoint=382 |court= |date=1992 |url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/505/505.US.377.90-7675.html |quote=}}</ref> and to survive the Act requires: 
#It "must be narrowly tailored to promote a compelling Government interest."
#"If a less restrictive alternative would serve the Government's purpose, the legislature must be use the alternative."<ref>{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc. |vol=529 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=803 |pinpoint=813 |court= |date=2000 |url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/529/529.US.803.html |quote=}}</ref> . 

The court invalidated the statute on both accounts. First, it said they limited the purpose of the Act to the actual harm to the brain of a child playing a violent video game. The state was required to show that "the recited harms are real, not merely conjectural, and that the regulation will in fact alleviate those harms as direct and material way."<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC |vol=512 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=622 |pinpoint= |court= |date=1994 |url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/512/512.US.622.93-44.html |quote=}}</ref> Here, the defendants have failed to do so because all of the reports the relied on in making these were admittedly flawed. <ref>Craig A.

Adolescence 23 (2004).[http://www.lionlamb.org/research_articles/study%202.pdf]</ref> The state is allowed to protect minors from actual psychological or neurological harm, but not control minors' thoughts. Second, the court also held that the defendants have not demonstrated the absence of less restrictive alternative means. In fact, Video games already comply with a voluntary rating system that rates video games based on their topics and age appropriateness. <ref>See [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]]</ref> This is a clear example of a less restrictive means. Least restrictive means is not the same as most effective means. <ref name="Schwarzenegger Ninth" /> . 

The court also evaluated the constitutionality of the Act's labeling provision, which requires that a label be affixed to the front of every package the state deems to be a "violent video game." Generally, "freedom of speech prohibits the government from telling people what they must say."<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc. |vol=547 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=47 |pinpoint= |court= |date=2006 |url= |quote=}}</ref> However, the court has upheld compelled commercial speech where it is the inclusion of "purely factual and uncontroversial information" in advertising. <ref>{{cite court |litigants=Zaruder v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel |vol=471 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=626 |pinpoint= |court= |date=2985 |url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/471/471.US.626.83-2166.html |quote=}}</ref> But, the labeling requirement of "violent video game" is not factual information. The Act has not clearly and legally provided a way to determine if a video game is violent so the sticker does not convey factual information. Consequently the statute is unconstitutional. <ref name="Schwarzenegger Ninth" /> . 

===The Ninth Circuit Appeal===. 
[[File:Arnold Schwarzenegger 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Then-Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] led the appeal of the lower courts' decisions.]] California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] appealed the ruling in September 2007, stating that he would "vigorously defend this law" and that he and the people of California have "a responsibility to our kids and our communities to protect against the effects of games that depict ultra-violent actions."<ref>{{cite web | url  = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=15064 | title = Schwarzenegger To Appeal California Game Law Ruling | first = James | last = Dobson | date = 2007-08-10 | accessdate =2010-11-01 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] affirmed Whyte's decision in 2009. <ref name="9thCirDecision">{{Cite court|litigants=Video Software Dealers Ass'n, et al. v.

The Ninth Circuit considered the constitutionality of the law; given the timeframe of the law's passing relative to litigation, it was referred to as the "Act" in the court's opinion. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's Summary Judgment for the VSDA by holding:
#The Act is a presumptively invalid content-based restriction on speech, so it is subject to strict scrutiny and not the "variable obscenity" standard from ''Ginsberg v.

Second, the court held that the defendants did not demonstrate the absence of less restrictive alternative means. In fact, video games already comply with a voluntary rating system that rates video games based on their topics and age appropriateness. <ref>See [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]]</ref> This is a clear example of a less restrictive means. The court noted that the least restrictive means is not the same as the most effective means. <ref name="Schwarzenegger Ninth" /> . 

The court also evaluated the constitutionality of the Act's labeling provision, which requires that a label be affixed to the front of every package the state deems to be a "violent video game." Generally, "freedom of speech prohibits the government from telling people what they must say."<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Rumsfeld v.

The Act has not clearly and legally provided a way to determine if a video game is violent so the sticker does not convey factual information.

===Supreme Court appeal===. 
[[File:Hansel-and-gretel-rackham.jpg|thumb|upright|The Supreme Court, along with those supporting the ESA side of the case, questioned whether violent video games should be treated differently from other media with similar violence regularly exposed to minors, such as the fairy tale of [[Hansel and Gretel]].]]
Gov. Schwarzenegger again appealed to the Supreme Court, looking to overturn the Ninth Circuit's ruling, filing a writ of ''[[certiorari]]'' to the Court in May 2009.

==Opinion==. 
[[File:Antonin Scalia, SCOTUS photo portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] wrote the majority opinion in the case.]]
On June 27, 2011, the Supreme Court issued a 7-2 opinion striking the California law as unconstitutional on the basis of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The majority opinion was authored by Justice Antonin Scalia and joined by Justices Ginsburg, Kennedy, Sotomayor, and Kagan.  It first held that "video games qualify for First Amendment protection": {{cquote|Like the protected books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video games communicate ideas--and even social messages--through many familiar literary devices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and through features distinctive to the medium (such as the player's interaction with the virtual world).  That suffices to confer First Amendment protection.}}Justice Scalia then affirmed that, while states may pass laws to block obscene material from minors as previously decided in the 1968 ''[[Ginsberg v. New York]]'' case, "speech about violence is not obscene," and California's statute was unlawful. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/06/violent-video-games-scotus/ | title = States May Not Ban Sale, Rental of Violent Videogames to Minors | first = David | last = Kravits | date =2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}</ref> The decision pointed to fairy tales like those of the [[Brothers Grimm]], which are regularly given to children to read, "contain no shortage of gore" that are also present in video games. <ref name="forbes decision"/> The decision further compared video games to classical works like ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'', stating that "Even if we can see in them nothing of any possible value to society[...], they are as much entitled to the protection of free speech as the best of literature."<ref name="time decision">{{Cite news | url = http://techland.time.com/2011/06/27/supreme-court-video-games-qualify-for-first-amendment-protection/ | title = Supreme Court: 'Video Games Qualify for First Amendment Protection' | first = Evan | last = Narcisse | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref> Scalia's decision also stated that the current self-moderated industry standards like the ESRB are operated effectively to regulate the sale of more mature games to minors, and that "filling the remaining modest gap in concerned-parents' control can hardly be a compelling state interest" requiring a law to enforce. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://ingame.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/06/27/6957472-1st-amendment-beats-ban-in-video-game-battle | title = 1st Amendment beats ban in video game battle | first = Stephen | last = Tolito | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | publisher = [[Kotaku]] }}</ref>  The Court's decision also determined that from the evidence, there was no "compelling" link between violent video games and its effects on children. <ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gazJYGtwgygMOKo0UkFFbt2IQ41g?docId=CNG.8685d6a6040541cc62b1b2322b148bc7.681 | title = Top US court zaps violent videogame sales ban | work = [[Agence France-Presse]] | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 }}</ref> The decision cited one medical report that asserted that cartoons like ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' generate the same effects in children as in games like ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' or imagery of guns. <ref name="forbes decision"/> . 

=== Alito's concurrence ===. 
Justice [[Samuel Alito]] wrote a separate [[concurrence]] supporting the majority decision, and was joined by Chief Justice [[John G. Roberts]]. Though Alito agreed with the constitutional application to the California law, believing that its "threshold requirement" that guides what material would be covered by the law was too broad, he questioned the potential [[double standard]] that existed between violence and sexual content in regards to this threshold. <ref>{{Cite web | url = http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/06/puritans-and-lady-godiva-why-two-justices-voted-to-uphold-californias-video-game-law.ars?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss | title = Puritans and Lady Godiva: why two justices voted to uphold California's video game law | first=  Nate | last=  Anderson | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate =2011-06-27 | publisher = [[Ars Technica]] }}</ref> Alito wrote that he was unsure that there was no connection between violent video games and effects on children, stating that "There are reasons to suspect that the experience of playing violent video games just might be very different from reading a book, listening to the radio, or watching a movie or a television show," referencing the book '' Infinite Reality '' which highlights the psychological effects of virtual reality, and argued that the decision "would not squelch legislative efforts to deal with what is perceived by some to be a significant and developing social problem."<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35463/Supreme_Court_Decision_Alito_Expresses_Uncertainty_About_Violent_Games_Effects.php | title = Supreme Court Decision: Alito Expresses Uncertainty About Violent Games' Effects | first = Kris | last = Graft | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref> . 

=== Dissents ===. 
Justices [[Clarence Thomas]] and [[Stephen Breyer]] dissented, each authoring a separate dissent. Justice Thomas, in his dissent, considered that historically, the Founding Fathers "believed parents to have complete authority over their minor children and expected parents to direct the development of those children," and that the intent of the First Amendment "does not include a right to speak to minors (or a right of minors to access speech) without going through the minors' parents or guardians."<ref name="gamasutra dissent">{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35471/Supreme_Court_Decision_The_Dissenters_Side.php | title = Supreme Court Decision: The Dissenters' Side | first = Kris | last = Graft | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref><ref name="cnet decision"/> . 

Breyer wrote separately, concerned that the majority's decision conflicts with previous rulings from ''Ginsberg'' and ''Miller''. He contrasted the previous findings regulating sales of publications containing nudity to those of violent video games: "But what sense does it make to forbid selling to a 13-year-old boy a magazine with an image of a nude woman, while protecting a sale to that 13­ year-old of an interactive video game in which he actively, but virtually, binds and gags the woman, then tortures and kills her?"<ref name="gamasutra dissent"/> Breyer further argued that "This case is ultimately less about censorship than it is about education," believing that the Government has a vested interest in allowing parents to make decisions for their child as to "raise future generations committed cooperatively to making our system of government work," and that "California's law imposes no more than a modest restriction on expression."<ref name="gamasutra dissent"/><ref name="cnet decision">{{cite web | url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-20074680-281/u.s-supreme-court-strikes-down-violent-video-game-law/ | title = U.S. Supreme Court strikes down violent video game law | first =Declan | last = McCullagh | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | publisher = [[CNet]] }}</ref> Breyer also expressed concern that the self-regulation of the industry still allowed for 20% of minors to purchase mature video games on a national average, and as high as 50% in the case of one nationwide chain, based on the aforementioned 2011 [[Federal Trade Commission]] study. <ref name="gamasutra dissent"/> . 

==Reactions==. 
The ruling was praised by the video game industry, who had expected the law to be ruled unconstitutional, but sought affirmation by the Court. ESA's CEO, Michael Gallagher, responded that "The Court declared forcefully that content-based restrictions on games are unconstitutional; and that parents, not government bureaucrats, have the right to decide what is appropriate for their children."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35461/Video_Game_Industry_Celebrates_Supreme_Court_Victory.php | title= Video Game Industry Celebrates Supreme Court Victory | first = Frank | last = Cifaldi | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref> Bo Anderson of the EMA stated that "there now can be no argument whether video games are entitled to the same protection as books, movies, music, and other expressive entertainment," while Electronic Arts' CEO [[John Riccitiello]] asserted that the decision "affirmed the constitutional rights of game developers."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/06/27/business-technology-hardware-amp-equipment-us-video-games-sector-snap_8537172.html | title = Sector Snap: Game cos. cheer Supreme Court ruling | work = [[Associated Press]] | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate  =2011-06-27 }}</ref> Other entertainment industries, such as the Motion Picture Association of America, also showed support for the Court's decision.

Groups that supported the California law were critical of the decision.

Analysts believed that while this was a major victory for the video game industry, the challenge is not yet over. Dan Offner, a partner for the video game industry analysis firm Loeb & Loeb believed that similar laws and regulations will be sought by State and Federal governments, as "the regulation of mature content with respect to minors as a hot button issue for the Federal Trade Commission and the various state governments."<ref name="gamasutra decision analysis"/> Other analysts cited that as more game content becomes available online as opposed to retail channels, the focus may shift more towards "privacy and security" of children and preventing children from amassing large fees from pay-to-use gaming services, pointing to a $3 million settlement that [[Playdom]] had to pay for violating privacy of its younger users. <ref name="gamasutra decision analysis"/> Sean Bersell of the EMA noted that future debates over violent video games may involve public opinion in addition to new legislation, noting that "Retailers along with publishers and parents all have a role in keeping kids away from these games."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/231288/violent_video_game_debate_where_do_we_go_from_here.html | title = Violent Video Game Debate: Where Do We Go From Here? | first = David | last = Daw | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | work = [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] }}</ref> Seth Schiesel of the ''[[New York Times]]'' proposed that the Court's decision should be a challenge to the industry to show that they can mature on the decision that [[art game|video games are a form of art]], questioning the industry "Will you use it as cover to pump out schlock or will you rise to the opportunity and respectability that has been afforded you?"<ref name="nytimes schiesel">{{cite web | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/29/arts/video-games/what-supreme-court-ruling-on-video-games-means.html | title = Supreme Court Has Ruled; Now Games Have a Duty | work = [[New York Times]] | first = Seth | last = Schiesel | date = 2011-06-28 | accessdate  =2011-06-28 }}</ref> Schiesel also considered that games that are more interactive may help players to become more aware of the consequences of their actions. <ref name="nytimes schiesel"/> . 

In January 2012, the state of California agreed to pay the ESA $950,000 for reimbursing the ESA's legal fees during the Supreme Court trial, atop approximately $350,000 in fees from the previous trias at lower courts.

===Public opinion===. 
A national telephone poll conducted in the second quarter of 2011 by [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]]’s [[Fairleigh Dickinson University#PublicMind|PublicMind]] showed that a majority of American voters (57%) agreed that the states should have the “right to regulate the sale of video games [that are violent] in order to protect minors; the same way states regulate tobacco, alcohol and pornography.” On the other hand, 39% of voters agreed with the Court’s majority that “parents should make the decision” about what video games they purchase for their children, and what constitutes “too violent.” These voters agreed with the statement “states do not have the right to decide that some video games are too violent for [minors], any more than they have the right to decide what literature or fairy tales are too violent.” The poll was conducted before the Court released its decision on June 27, 2011. <ref name="publicmind.fdu.edu">Fairleigh Dickinson University’s PublicMind, (2011, June 6).

Demographic breakouts demonstrated that men were more likely than women to agree that the supervision of minors’ video purchases should be left to parents, and not be regulated by the states.
