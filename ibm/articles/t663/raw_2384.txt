'''Conscription''' is the compulsory enlistment of people in some sort of [[national service]], most often [[military service]]. <ref name="mw">{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conscription |title=Conscription |publisher= Merriam-Webster Online }}</ref>  Conscription dates back to antiquity and continues in some countries to the present day under various names.  The modern system of near-universal national conscription for young men dates to the [[French Revolution]] in the 1790s, where it became the basis of a very large and powerful [[military]]. Most [[Europe]]an nations later copied the system in peacetime, so that men at a certain age would serve 1–3 years on [[active duty]], then transfer to the [[military reserve force|reserve force]].  . 

In China, the [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]] instituted universal military service following the registration of every household. <ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=M5Wvw2i84DAC&pg=PA178&lpg=PA178&dq=qin+dynasty+universal+conscription+years&source=bl&ots=2YGV2bXhdJ&sig=Og52IgxcX-sJJg1TTONbLeJ-i5g&hl=en&ei=NXk6Tou0E9K1hAfbwIiaAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q&f=false War and state formation in ancient ... - Google Books<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  This allowed huge armies to be levied, and was instrumental in the creation of the [[Qin Dynasty|Qin Empire]] that conquered the whole of China in 221BC.  . 

Conscription is controversial, because of [[conscientious objection]] to service, or political objection to service for a disliked government, or an unpopular war, and because it violates individual rights. Those conscripted may evade service, sometimes by leaving the country. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/war_conflict/vietnam_war/topics/348/ |title=Seeking Sanctuary: Draft Dodgers |newspaper= CBC Digital Archives }}</ref>  Some selection systems accommodate these attitudes by providing [[alternative service]] outside [[combat]]-operations roles or even outside the military, such as [[Zivildienst]] in [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]].  . 

As of the early 21st century, many states no longer conscript soldiers, relying instead upon professional militaries with [[volunteer military|volunteers]] enlisted to meet the demand for troops.  The ability to rely on such an arrangement, however, presupposes some degree of predictability with regard to both war-fighting requirements and the scope of hostilities.  Many states that have abolished conscription therefore still reserve the power to resume it during [[war]]time or times of crisis. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0008717 |title=World War II |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia }}</ref> In the [[United States]], conscription, also called "[[conscription in the United States|the draft]]", ended in 1973, but males between 18 and 25 are required to register with the [[Selective Service System]] to enable a reintroduction of conscription if necessary.  . 

==History==. 
===Ilkum===. 
Around the reign of [[Hammurabi]] (1791-1750 [[Before Common Era|BCE]]), the [[Babylonian Empire]] used a system of conscription called ''Ilkum''. Under the system those eligible were required to serve in the royal army in time of war. <ref name=JN242 /> During times of peace they were instead required to provide labour for other activities of the state. <ref name=JN242 /> In return for this service, those subject to it gained the right to hold land. <ref name=JN242 /> It is possible that this right was not to hold land per se but specific land supplied by the state. <ref name=JN242>{{Cite book |title=Early Mesopotamia Society and Economy at the Dawn of History |last=Postgate |first=J.N. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0415110327 |page=242 |postscript=. }}</ref> . 

Various forms of avoiding military service are recorded. While it was outlawed by the [[Code of Hammurabi]], the hiring of substitutes appears to have been practiced both before and after the creation of the code. <ref name=JN243 />  Later records show that Ilkum commitments could become regularly traded. <ref name=JN243 />  In other places, people simply left their towns to avoid their Ilkum service. <ref name=JN243 /> Another option was to sell Ilkum lands and the commitments along with them. With the exception of a few exempted classes, this was forbidden by the Code of Hammurabi. <ref name=JN243>{{Cite book |title=Early Mesopotamia Society and Economy at the Dawn of History |last=Postgate |first=J.N. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0415110327 |page=243 |postscript=. }}</ref> . 

===China===. 
Universal conscription in China dates back to the State of Qin, which eventually became the Qin Empire of 221BC.  Following unification, historical records show that a total of 300,000 conscript soldiers and 500,000 conscript labourers constructed the Great Wall of China<ref>[http://www.chinapage.com/friend/goh/beijing/greatwall/greatwall.html Great Wall<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . 

In the following dynasties, universal conscription was abolished and reintroduced on numerous occasions.  . 

{{as of|2011}}<!-- "Since [year]", supported by a cite, would be better.-->, universal military conscription is theoretically mandatory in the People's Republic of China, and reinforced by law.  However, due to the large population of China and large pool of candidates available for recruitment, the People's Liberation Army has always had sufficient volunteers, so conscription has not been required in practice at all.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} . 

===Medieval levies===. 
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2010}} . 

Under the [[feudalism|feudal]] conditions for holding land in the medieval period, most [[peasants]] and [[Serfdom#Freemen|freemen]] were liable to provide one man of suitable age per family for military duty when required by either the king or the local lord.  The levies raised in this way fought as infantry under local superiors.  Although the exact laws varied greatly depending on the country and the period, generally these levies were only obliged to fight for one to three months.  Most were subsistence farmers, and it was in everyone's interest to send the men home for harvest-time.  . 

In medieval [[Scandinavia]] the 'leiðangr' ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]), 'leidang' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), 'leding', ([[Danish language|Danish]]), 'ledung' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]), 'lichting' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]), 'expeditio' ([[Latin]]) or sometimes 'leþing' ([[English language|Old English]]), was a levy of free farmers conscripted into coastal fleets for seasonal excursions and in defence of the realm.  . 

The bulk of the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon English]] army, called the [[Leidang#England|fyrd]], was composed of part-time English soldiers drawn from the landowning minor nobility. These [[thegn]]s were the land-holding aristocracy of the time and were required to serve with their own armour and weapons for a certain number of days each year. The historian David Sturdy has cautioned about regarding the ''fyrd'' as a precursor to a modern national army composed of all ranks of society, describing it as a "ridiculous fantasy":<blockquote>The persistent old belief that peasants and small farmers gathered to form a national army or ''fyrd'' is a strange delusion dreamt up by antiquarians in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries to justify universal military conscription. <ref>Sturdy, David ''Alfred the Great'' Constable (1995), p153</ref></blockquote> . 

===Military slavery===. 
The system of military [[slaves]] was widely used in the Middle East, beginning with the Egyptians training [[Mamluk]]s from the 9th century, to the Turks and [[Ottoman Empire]] through the 19th century.  . 

In the middle of the 14th century, Ottoman Sultan [[Murad I]] developed personal troops to be loyal to him, with a slave army called the ''Kapıkulu''. The new force was built by taking Christian children from newly conquered lands, especially from the far areas of his empire, in a system known as the ''[[devşirme]]'' (translated "gathering" or "converting").  The captive children were persuaded to convert to [[Islam]].  The Sultans [[Military use of children|had the young boys trained]] over several years.  Those who showed special promise in fighting skills were trained in advanced warrior skills, put into the sultan's personal service, and turned into the [[Janissary|Janissaries]], the elite branch of the ''Kapıkulu''. A number of distinguished military commanders of the Ottomans, and most of the imperial administrators and upper-level officials of the Empire, such as [[Pargalı İbrahim Pasha]] and [[Sokollu Mehmet Paşa]], were recruited in this way. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html |author=Bernard Lewis |title=Race and Slavery in the Middle East |publisher= Chapter readings for class at Fordham University }}</ref>  By 1609 the Sultan's ''Kapıkulu'' forces increased to about 100,000. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst373/readings/inalcik6.html |title=In the Service of the State and Military Class }}</ref> . 

In later years, Sultans turned to the [[Barbary Pirates]] to supply their Jannissaries corps.  Their attacks on ships off the coast of Africa or in the Mediterranean, and subsequent capture of able bodied men for ransom or sale provided some captives for the Sultan's system. Starting in the 17th century, Christian families living under the Ottoman rule began to submit their sons into the Kapikulu system willingly, as they saw this as a potentially invaluable career opportunity for their children. Eventually the Sultan turned to foreign volunteers from the warrior clans of [[Circassians]] in southern Russia to fill his Janissary armies.  As a whole the system began to break down, the loyalty of the Jannissaries became increasingly suspect. [[Mahmud II]] forcibly disbanded the Janissary corps in 1826. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-300350/Janissary |title= Janissary corps, or Janizary, or Yeniçeri (Turkish military) |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] }}</ref><ref>[http://i-cias.com/e.o/janissaries.htm Janissaries]</ref> . 

Similar to the Janissaries in origin and means of development were the Mamluks of Egypt in the [[Middle Ages]].  The [[Mamluks]] were usually captive non-Muslim Iranian and Turkish children who had been kidnapped or bought as slaves from the Barbary coasts.  The Egyptians assimilated and trained the boys and young men to become Islamic soldiers who served the Muslim [[caliph]]s and the [[Ayyubid]] sultans during the [[Middle Ages]].  The first mamluks served the [[Abbasid]] caliphs in 9th century [[Baghdad]]. Over time they became a powerful military [[caste]].  On more than one occasion, they seized power, for example, ruling [[Egypt]] from 1250–1517.  . 

From 1250 [[Egypt]] had been ruled by the [[Bahri dynasty]] of [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] origin. Slaves from the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasus]] served in the army and formed an elite corp of troops.  They eventually revolted in Egypt to form the [[Burgi dynasty]].  The Mamluks' excellent fighting abilities, massed Islamic armies, and overwhelming numbers succeeded in overcoming the Christian [[Crusades|Crusader]] fortresses in the Holy Land.  The Mamluks were the most successful defense against the [[Ilkhanate|Mongol Ilkhanate]] of Persia and Iraq from entering Egypt. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sunnahonline.com/ilm/seerah/0075_popup11.htm |title=The Mamluk (Slave) Dynasty (Timeline) |newspaper=Sunnah Online }}</ref> . 

On the western coast of Africa, Berber Muslims captured non-Muslims to put to work as laborers.  They generally converted the younger people to Islam and many became quite assimilated.  In Morocco, the Berber looked south rather than north.  The Moroccan Sultan [[Moulay Ismail]], called  "the Bloodthirsty" (1672–1727), employed a corps of 150,000 black slaves, called his [[Black Guard]].  He used them to coerce the country into submission. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html |author=Lewis |title=Race and Slavery in the Middle East |publisher=Oxford University Press |year= 1994 }}</ref> . 

===Invention of modern conscription===. 
Modern conscription, the massed military enlistment of national citizens, was devised during the [[French Revolution]], to enable the [[French Republic|Republic]] to defend itself from the attacks of European monarchies.  Deputy [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan]] gave its name to the 5 September 1798 Act, whose first article stated: "Any Frenchman is a soldier and owes himself to the defense of the [[patriotism|nation]]."  It enabled the creation of the ''[[Grande Armée]]'', what [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] called "the nation in arms," which overwhelmed European professional armies that often numbered only into the low tens of thousands.  More than 2.6 million men were inducted into the French military in this way between the years 1800 and 1813. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Conscription|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761561714/conscription.html|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwRJ8b4l|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}</ref> . 

The defeat of the [[Prussian Army]] in particular shocked the Prussian establishment, which had believed it was invincible after the victories of [[Frederick the Great]].  The Prussians were used to relying on superior organization and tactical factors such as order of battle to focus superior troops against inferior ones.  Given approximately equivalent forces, as was generally the case with professional armies, these factors showed considerable importance.  However, they became considerably less important when the Prussian armies faced forces that outnumbered their own in some cases by more than ten to one.  [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]] advocated adopting the ''[[levée en masse]]'', the military conscription used by France.  The ''Krümpersystem'' was the beginning of short-term compulsory service in Prussia, as opposed to the long-term conscription previously used. <ref>Dierk Walter. ''Preussische Heeresreformen 1807–1870: Militärische Innovation und der Mythos der "Roonschen Reform"''. 2003, in Citino, p. 130</ref> . 

In the [[Russian Empire]], the military service time "owed" by serfs was 25 years at the beginning of the 19th century.  In 1834 it was decreased to 20 years.  The recruits were to be not younger than 17 and not older than 35. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roots-saknes.lv/Army/military_service_.htm |title=Military service in Russia Empire |publisher=roots-saknes.lv }}</ref> In 1874 Russia introduced universal conscription in the modern pattern, an innovation only made possible by the abolition of [[Serfdom in Russia|serfdom]] in 1861.  New military law decreed that all male Russian subjects, when they reached the age of 20, were eligible to serve in the military for six years. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/tcimo/tulp/Research/ARMING.htm  |title=Conscription and Resistance: The Historical Context archived from the original |date=2008-06-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080603141235/http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/tcimo/tulp/Research/ARMING.htm |archivedate = 2008-06-03}}</ref> . 

===World Wars===. 
The range of eligible ages for conscripting was expanded to meet national demand during the World Wars. 
In the United States, the [[Selective Service System]] drafted men for World War I initially in an age range from 21 to 30 but expanded its eligibility in 1918 to an age range of 18 to 45. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/163.html |title=Records of the Selective Service System (World War I) }}; see also [[Selective Service Act of 1917]] and [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940]]. </ref>  In the case of a widespread [[mobilization]] of forces where service includes homefront defense, ages of conscripts may range much higher, with the oldest conscripts serving in roles requiring lesser mobility.  Expanded-age conscription was common during the Second World War: in Britain, it was commonly known as "call-up" and extended to age 51. [[Nazi Germany]] termed it [[Volkssturm]] ("People's Storm") and included men as young as 16 and as old as 60. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lonesentry.com/articles/volkssturm/index.html |title=The German Volkssturm from Intelligence Bulletin |date = February 1945|publisher=lonesentry.com }}</ref> During the Second World War, both Britain and the Soviet Union conscripted women. The United States was on the verge of drafting women into the Nurse Corps because it anticipated it would need the extra personnel for its planned invasion of Japan. However the Japanese surrendered and the idea was abandoned. <ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/military-international/ | work=CBC News | title=CBC News Indepth: International military}}</ref> . 

===The Netherlands===. 
{{main|Conscription in the Netherlands}}
Conscription, which was called "Service Duty"({{lang-nl|dienstplicht}}) in the Netherlands, was first employed in 1810 by French occupying forces. Napoleon's brother Louis Bonaparte, who was King of Holland from 1806 to 1810, had tried to introduce conscription a few years earlier, unsuccessfully. Every man aged 20 years or older had to enlist. By means of drawing lots it was decided who had to undertake service in the French army. It was possible to arrange a substitute against payment.  . 

Later on, conscription was used for all men over the age of 18. Postponement was possible, due to study, for example. Conscientious objectors could perform an alternative civilian service instead of military service. For various reasons, this forced military service was criticized at the end of the twentieth century. Since the Cold War was over, so was the direct threat of a war. Instead, the Dutch army was employed in more and more peacekeeping operations. The complexity and danger of these missions made the use of conscripts controversial. Furthermore the conscription system was thought to be unfair as only men were drafted.  . 

In the European part of Netherlands, compulsory attendance has been officially suspended since 1 May 1997. Between 1991 and 1996, the Dutch armed forces phased out their conscript personnel and converted to an all-volunteer force. The last conscript troops were inducted in 1995 and demobilized in 1996. The suspension means that citizens are no longer forced to serve in the armed forces, as long as it is not required for the safety of the country. Since then, the Dutch army is an all-volunteer force. However, to this day every male citizen aged 17 gets a letter in which he is told that he has been registered, but he does not have to present himself for service. The Dutch army allowed its male soldiers to have long hair from the early 1970s to the end of conscription in the mid 1990s.  . 

Even though it is generally thought that conscription has been abolished in the Netherlands, this perception is, in fact, incorrect. The compulsory attendance was abolished, not the conscription. The laws and systems which provide for the conscription of armed forces personnel still remain in place. In Curaçao and Aruba, conscription is still in existence.  . 

===Britain===. 
{{main|Conscription in the United Kingdom}}
Britain introduced conscription for the first time in 1916 (halfway through [[World War I]]) and abolished it in 1920, and reintroduced it again in 1939 on the outbreak of [[World War II]]. It remained in force until 1960.  . 

In all, 8,000,000 men were drafted, as well as several hundred thousand women. <ref>Roger Broad, ''Conscription in Britain 1939-1964: The Militarization of a Generation'' (2006)</ref>  The introduction of conscription in May 1939, before the war began, was largely due to pressure from the French, who emphasized the need for a large British army to oppose the Germans. <ref>Daniel Hucker, "Franco-British Relations and the Question of Conscription in Britain, 1938-1939," ''Contemporary European History,'' Nov 2008, Vol. 17 Issue 4, pp 437-456</ref>  Starting in early 1942 unmarried women age 19-30 were conscripted.  Most were sent to the factories, but they could volunteer for the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] (ATS) and other women's services.  None were assigned to combat roles unless they volunteered. By 1943 women were liable to some form of directed labour up to age 51. During the Second World War, 1.4 million British men volunteered  for service and 3.2 million were conscripted. Volunteers comprised 20% of the Army, 40% of the Royal Navy, and 50% of the Royal Air Force. <ref>Jeremy A. Crang, "'Come into the Army, Maud': Women, Military Conscription, and the Markham Inquiry," ''Defence Studies,'' Nov 2008, Vol. 8 Issue 3, pp 381-395; statistics from pp 392-3</ref> . 

The abolition of conscription in Britain was announced on 4 April 1957 by recently elected prime minister [[Harold Macmillan]], with the last conscripts being recruited three years later. <ref>[http://www.expressandstar.com/days/1950-75/1957.html Those were the days<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . 

===United States===. 
{{Main|Conscription in the United States}} . 

====Colonial and Early National====. 
In America before 1862, combat duty was always voluntary, but white men aged 18 to 45 were usually required to join local militia units. Colonial militia laws—and after 1776 those of the states—required able-bodied white men to enroll in the militia and to undergo a minimum of military training, all without pay.  Colonial Pennsylvania (controlled by [[Quakers]]) did not have such laws. Members of pacifist religious denominations were exempt.  When combat troops were needed some of the militiamen volunteered for short terms of service, for which they were paid. Following this system in its essentials, the Continental Congress in 1778 recommended that the states draft men from their militias for one year's service in the Continental army; this first national conscription was irregularly applied and failed to fill the Continental ranks.  . 

In 1814, President James Madison proposed conscription of 40,000 men for the army, but the War of 1812 ended before Congress took any action. 
An 1840 proposal for a standing army of 200,000 men included conscription, but it never passed and military service was voluntary before 1862. <ref>{{cite book|author1=United States. War Dept|author2=Joel Roberts Poinsett|title=Plan of the standing army of 200,000 men: submitted to Congress by the Secretary of War, and recommended by the President of the United States|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Kep-lXNM2uIC|year=1840|publisher=s.n.|pages=[http://books.google.com/books?id=Kep-lXNM2uIC&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8 8]}}</ref> . 

====Civil War====. 
Although both North and South resorted to conscription during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], in neither region did the system work effectively. The Confederate Congress on April 16, 1862, passed an act requiring military service for three years from all males aged eighteen to thirty-five not legally exempt, and it later extended the obligation. The U.S. Congress followed on July 17, 1862, with an act authorizing a militia draft within a state when it could not meet its quota with volunteers. This state-administered system failed in practice and on March 3, 1863, Congress passed the first genuine national conscription law, setting up under the Union army an elaborate machinery for enrolling and drafting men between twenty and forty-five years of age.  . 

Quotas were assigned in each state, the deficiencies in volunteers to be met by conscription. But men drafted could provide substitutes or, until mid-1864, avoid service by paying commutation money. Many eligibles pooled their money to cover the cost of anyone drafted.  Families used the substitute provision to select which man should go into the army and which should stay home. There was much evasion and overt resistance to the draft, especially in Catholic areas. The great [[New York Draft Riots|draft riot in New York City in July 1863]] involved Irish immigrants who had been signed up as citizens to swell the machine vote, not realizing it made them liable for the draft. Of the 168,649 men procured for the Union through the draft, 117,986 were substitutes, leaving only 50,663 who had their personal services conscripted.  . 

The problem of Confederate desertion was aggravated by the inequitable inclinations of conscription officers and local judges. The three conscription acts of the Confederacy exempted certain categories, most notably the planter class, and enrolling officers and local judges often practiced favoritism, sometimes accepting bribes. Attempts to effectively deal with the issue were frustrated by conflict between state and local governments on the one hand and the national government of the Confederacy. <ref>* Albert Burton Moore. ''Conscription and Conflict in the Confederacy'' 1924 [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=10517499 online edition]</ref> . 

====World War I====. 
{{Main|Selective Service Act of 1917}}
[[Image:King, Stoddard WW1 draft card.jpg|right|thumb|A World War I era draft card.]]
In 1917 the administration of [[Woodrow Wilson]] decided to rely primarily on conscription, rather than voluntary enlistment, to raise military manpower for World War I.  The [[Selective Service Act of 1917]] was carefully drawn to remedy the defects in the Civil War system and—by allowing exemptions for dependency, essential occupations, and religious scruples—to place each man in his proper niche in a national war effort. The act established a "liability for military service of all male citizens"; authorized a selective draft of all those between twenty-one and thirty-one years of age (later from eighteen to forty-five); and prohibited all forms of bounties, substitutions, or purchase of exemptions. Administration was entrusted to local boards composed of leading civilians in each community. These boards issued draft calls in order of numbers drawn in a national lottery and determined exemptions. In 1917 and 1918 some 24 million men were registered and nearly 3 million inducted into the military services, with little of the resistance that characterized the Civil War. <ref>John Whiteclay Chambers II, ''To Raise an Army: The Draft Comes to Modern America'' (1987)</ref> . 

[[File:U.S. draft lottery.jpg|180px|left|thumb| Secretary of War Newton Baker draws the first draft number on 20 July 1917.]] . 

====World War II====. 
In 1940 Congress passed the first peace-time [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] legislation, which was led by [[Grenville Clark]]. It was renewed (by one vote) in summer 1941. It involved questions as to who should control the draft, the size of the army, and the need for deferments. The system worked through local draft boards comprising community leaders who were given quotas and then decided how to fill them. There was very little draft resistance. <ref>Flynn (1993)</ref> . 

The nation went from a surplus manpower pool with high unemployment and relief in 1940 to a severe manpower shortage by 1943. Industry realized that the Army urgently desired production of essential war materials and foodstuffs more than soldiers. (Large numbers of soldiers were not used until the invasion of Europe in summer 1944.) In 1940-43 the Army often transferred soldiers to civilian status in the Enlisted Reserve Corps in order to increase production. Those transferred would return to work in essential industry, although they could be called back to active duty if the Army needed them. Others were discharged if their civilian work was deemed absolutely essential. There were instances of mass releases of men to increase production in various industries. Blacks and Asians were drafted under the same terms as whites.  . 

One contentious issue involved the drafting of fathers, which was avoided as much as possible. The drafting of 18-year olds was desired by the military but vetoed by public opinion.  Farmers demanded and were generally given occupational deferments (many volunteered anyway, and those who stayed at home were not eligible for postwar veteran's benefits).  . 

Later in the war, in light of the tremendous amount of manpower that would be necessary for the invasion of France, many earlier deferment categories became draft eligible. <ref>George Q. Flynn, ''The Draft, 1940-1973'' (1993)</ref> .

In the United Kingdom during World War II, beginning in 1941, women were brought into the scope of conscription but, as all women with dependent children were exempt and many women were informally left in occupations such as nursing or teaching, the number conscripted was relatively few. <ref>{{Cite book

In 2002, Sweden considered female conscription on the grounds that excluding them goes against the ideology of equality.  . 

In the [[USSR]], there was no systematic conscription of women for the armed forces, but the severe disruption of normal life and the high proportion of civilians affected by World War II after the German invasion attracted many volunteers for what was termed "[[The Great Patriotic War]]". <ref>{{Cite book

In 1981 in the United States, several men filed lawsuit in the case ''[[Rostker v. Goldberg]]'', alleging that the [[Selective Service Act of 1948]] violates the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] by only requiring that men register with the [[Selective Service System]] (SSS). The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] eventually upheld the Act, stating that "the argument for registering women was based on considerations of equity, but Congress was entitled, in the exercise of its constitutional powers, to focus on the question of military need, rather than 'equity.'"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0453_0057_ZS.html |title=Rostker v.

Traditionally conscription has been limited to the male population. Women and [[handicapped]] males have been exempted from conscription.  Many societies have traditionally considered military service as a [[initiation rite|test of manhood]] and a [[rite of passage]] from boyhood into manhood. <ref>{{Cite book

==Conscientious objection==. 
{{Main|Conscientious objection|Antimilitarism|Conscientious objection throughout the world}}
A [[conscientious objector]] is an individual whose personal beliefs are incompatible with [[Armed forces|military service]], or, more often, with any role in the armed forces. In some countries, conscientious objectors have special legal status, which augments their conscription duties. For example, Sweden used to allow conscientious objectors to choose a service in the "weapons-free" branch, such as an airport fireman, nurse or telecommunications technician.  . 

Most refuse such service, as they feel that such roles are a part of the military complex. The reasons for refusing to serve are varied. Some conscientious objectors are so for religious reasons — notably, the members of the historic [[peace churches]], [[pacifism|pacifist]] by doctrine; [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], while not strictly pacifists, refuse to participate in the armed forces on the ground that they believe Christians should be neutral in worldly conflicts.  . 

==Evading the draft==. 
{{Globalize/US|date=August 2010}}
{{Main|Draft dodger}}
The [[New York Draft Riots]] (July 11 to July 16, 1863; known at the time as ''Draft Week''), were violent disturbances in New York City that were the culmination of discontent with new laws passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] to [[Conscription in the United States#Early drafts|draft]] men to fight in the ongoing [[American Civil War]]. The [[Central Asian Revolt]] started in the summer of 1916, when the [[Russian Empire]] government ended its exemption of Muslims from military service. The conscription also became unpopular in [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] during the reign of [[Nicholas II]] and was suspended; instead Finland paid a levy tax, "military millions" as compensation for abolition of conscription.  . 

In the USA and some other countries, the [[Vietnam War]] saw new levels of opposition to conscription and the [[Selective Service System]]. Many people opposed to and facing conscription chose to either apply for classification and assignment to civilian alternative service or noncombatant service within the military as conscientious objectors, or to evade the draft by fleeing to a neutral country. A small proportion, like [[Muhammad Ali]], chose to resist the draft by publicly and politically fighting conscription. Some people resist at the point of registration for the draft. In the USA around 1970, for example, the draft resistance movement has focused on mandatory draft registration. Others resist at the point of induction, when they are ordered to put on a uniform, when they are ordered to carry or use a weapon, or when they are ordered into combat.  . 

In the United States, especially during the Vietnam Era, some used political connections to ensure that they were placed well away from any potential harm, serving in what was termed a [[Champagne unit]]. Many would avoid military service altogether through college deferments, by becoming fathers, or serving in various exempt jobs (teaching was one possibility). Others used educational exemptions, became conscientious objectors or pretended to be conscientious objectors, although they might then be drafted for non-combat work, such as serving as a [[combat medic]]. It was also possible they could be asked to do similar civilian work, such as being a hospital orderly.  . 

It was, in fact, quite easy for those with some knowledge of the system to avoid being drafted. A simple route, widely publicized, was to get a medical rejection. While a person could claim to have symptoms (or feign [[homosexuality]]) if enough physicians sent letters that a person had a problem, he might well be rejected. It often wasn't worth the Army's time to dispute this claim. Such an approach worked best in a larger city where there was no stigma to not serving, and the potential draftee was not known to those reviewing him.  . 

For others, the most common method of avoiding the draft was to cross the border into another country. People who have been "called up" for military service and who attempted to avoid it in some way were known as "draft-dodgers". Particularly during the Vietnam War, US draft-dodgers usually made their way to Canada, Mexico or Sweden.  . 

Many people looked upon draft-dodgers with scorn as being "cowards", but some supported them in their efforts. In the late years of the [[Vietnam War]], objections against it and support for draft-dodgers was much more outspoken, because of the casualties suffered by American troops, and the actual cause and purpose of the war being heavily questioned.  . 

Toward the end of the US draft, an attempt was made to make the system somewhat fairer by turning it into a lottery, with each of the year's calendar dates randomly assigned a number. Men born on lower numbered dates were called up for review. For the reasons given above, this did not make the system any fairer, and the entire system ended in 1973. By 1975, the draft was no longer mandatory. Today, American men aged 18–25 are encouraged to sign up for the Military, but there has not been a call-up since the Vietnam Era.  . 

In Israel, the Muslim and Christian Arab minority are exempt from mandatory service, as are permanent residents such as the [[Druze]] of the Golan Heights. Male Ultra-Orthodox Jews may apply for a deferment of draft to study in [[Yeshiva]], and the deferment tends to become an exemption, while female religious Jews can be exempted after presenting "religious declaration" to the IDF authorities, and some (primarily National Religious or Modern Orthodox) choose to volunteer for national service instead. Male [[Druze]] and [[Circassians|Circassian]] Israeli citizens are liable, by agreement with their community leaders (Female Druze and Circassian are exempt from service).  Members of the exempted groups can still volunteer, but very few do, except for the Bedouin where a relatively large number have tended to volunteer (usually for financial reasons).  .

==Arguments against conscription==. 
===Slavery===. 
American [[libertarians]] oppose it because, as Rep. [[Ron Paul]] says, since "Conscription is wrongly associated with patriotism, when it really represents slavery and involuntary servitude."<ref>U.S. Representative [[Ron Paul]] [http://antiwar.com/paul/?articleid=5651 Conscription Is Slavery], antiwar.com, January 14, 2003. </ref> The philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] opposed it because "Of all the statist violations of individual rights in a mixed economy, the military draft is the worst. It is an abrogation of rights. It negates man’s fundamental right—the right to life—and establishes the fundamental principle of statism: that a man’s life belongs to the state, and the state may claim it by compelling him to sacrifice it in battle."<ref>[http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/draft.html Draft — Ayn Rand Lexicon<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . 

In 1917, a number of radicals and anarchists, including [[Emma Goldman]], challenged the new draft law in federal court arguing that it was a direct violation of the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude.  However the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the case of Arver v. United States on January 7, 1918.  The decision said the Constitution gave Congress the power to declare war and to raise and support armies.  The Court emphasized the principle of the reciprocal rights and duties of citizens:
:"It may not be doubted that the very conception of a just government in its duty to the citizen includes the reciprocal obligation of the citizen to render military service in case of need and the right to compel.". <ref>John Whiteclay Chambers II, ''To Raise an Army: The Draft Comes to Modern America'' (1987) p 219-20</ref> . 

===Economics===. 
It can be argued that in a cost-to-benefit ratio, conscription during peace time is not worthwhile. <ref>Henderson, David R. "[http://econjwatch.org/issues/volume-2-issue-2-august-2005 The Role of Economists in Ending the Draft]" (August 2005). </ref> Months or years of service amongst the most fit and capable subtracts from the productivity of the economy; add to this the cost of training them, and in some countries paying them. Compared to these extensive costs, some would argue there is very little benefit; if there ever was a war then conscription and basic training could be completed quickly, and in any case there is little threat of a war in most countries with conscription. In the United States, every male resident must register with the [[Selective Service System]]  on his 18th birthday, so he is available for a draft.  . 

The cost of conscription can be related to the [[parable of the broken window]]. The cost of the work—in this case military service—does not disappear even if no salary is paid. The work effort of the conscripts is effectively wasted, as an unwilling workforce is extremely inefficient. The impact is especially severe in wartime, when civilian professionals are forced to fight as amateur soldiers. Not only is the work effort of the conscripts wasted and productivity lost, but professionally-skilled conscripts are also difficult to replace in the civilian workforce. Every soldier conscripted in the army is taken away from his civilian work, and away from contributing to the economy which funds the military. This is not a problem in an agrarian or pre-industrialized state where the level of education is universally low, and where a worker is easily replaced by another. However, this proves extremely problematic in a [[post-industrial society]] where educational levels are high and where the workforce is highly sophisticated and a replacement for a conscripted specialist is difficult to find. Even direr economic consequences result if the professional conscripted as an amateur soldier is killed or maimed for life; his work effort and productivity is irrevocably lost. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2136&chapter=195469&layout=html&Itemid=27#c_NIR_1360-016_footnote_nt1046 |title=Why Not a Volunteer Army? |accessdate=9 11 2008 |author=[[Milton Friedman]] |year=1967 |work=New Individualist Review}}</ref> . 

==Arguments for conscription==. 
===Political and moral motives===. 
{{Further|Social contract|Social solidarity|Active citizenship}}
[[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] argued vehemently against professional armies, feeling it was the right and privilege of every citizen to participate to the defense of the whole society and a mark of moral decline to leave this business to professionals. He based this view on the development of the [[Roman republic]], which came to an end at the same time as the Roman army changed from a conscript to professional force. <ref>[[s:The Social Contract|Rousseau, J-J. Social Contract.]] Chapter "The Roman Comitia"</ref> Similarly, [[Aristotle]] linked the division of armed service among the populace intimately with the political order of the state. <ref>[[s:Politics (Aristotle)/Book 6|Aristotle, Politics, Book 6]] Chapter VII and [[s:Politics (Aristotle)/Book 4|Book 4]] Chapter XIII. </ref> [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] argued strongly for conscription, seeing the professional armies as the cause of the failure of societal unity in Italy.  . 

Other proponents such as the late [[William James]] consider both mandatory military and [[national service]] as ways of instilling maturity in young adults. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.constitution.org/wj/meow.htm |title=The Moral Equivalent of War |author= William James |year=1906 }}</ref> Some proponents such as [[Jonathan Alter]] and [[Mickey Kaus]] support a draft in order to reinforce social equality, create social consciousness, break down class divisions and for young adults to immerse themselves in public enterprise. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/1995/07/30/cop-out-on-class.html |title=Cop Out on Class |first=Jonathan |last=Alter |newspaper=Newsweek }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2010/03/12/interview_with_mickey_kaus_104743.html |title=Interview with Mickey Kaus |publisher=realclearpolitics.com }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reason.com/archives/1995/10/01/overcoming-merit |title=Overcoming Merit |first=Virginia |last=Postrel |authorlink=Virginia Postrel }}</ref> . 

===Economic & resource efficiency===. 
{{Further|Industrial warfare|Total war|War effort}}
It is estimated by the British military that in a professional military, one company deployed for active duty in peacekeeping corresponds to three inactive companies at home. Salaries for each are paid from the military budget. In contrast, volunteers from a trained reserve are in their civilian jobs when they are not deployed. <ref>{{Cite book
