'''Universal National Service Act of 2006''', sponsored by Rep. [[Charles Rangel]], was introduced into the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on February 14, 2006.  On February 23, 2006, it was referred to the House [[United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel|Subcommittee on Military Personnel]].  The bill was never enacted.  . 

==Public debate== . 

Rep. Rangel argued that the bill was necessary since in the case of a mandatory draft members of the U.S. Congress would be much less likely to authorize an unnecessary war if they knew that their own children and family members might be sent to fight it. He was quoted as saying:"There’s no question in my mind that this president and this administration would never have invaded Iraq, especially on the flimsy evidence that was presented to the Congress if indeed we had a draft and members of Congress and the administration thought that their kids from their communities would be placed in harm’s way"<ref>Tom Zeller Jr. [http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/iraq/2006/11/20/ To Rangel With the Draft.] [[New York Times]], November 20, 2006. Accessed May 13, 2008</ref> Rangel also argued that bringing back the draft would remedy the social disparity reflected by the fact the currently the burden of military service falls disproportionately on the poor and the minorities. <ref>[http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/ny15_rangel/CBRStatementonDraft02142006.html RANGEL REINTRODUCES DRAFT BILL.] Congressional Press Release.

Quote:"I dare anyone to try to convince me that this war is not being fought predominantly by tough, loyal, and patriotic young men and women from the barren hills and towns of rural and underprivileged neighborhoods in urban America where unemployment is high  and opportunities are few.  As we see who are the troops coming home wounded and killed, I challenge anyone to tell me that the wealthiest have not been excluded from that roll call."</ref> Initially, the bill received little public, media or congressional attention. <ref>Michel Chossudovsky.

May 30, 2006Quote:"While there was some media coverage of Rangel's initiative prior to the formal introduction of the bill, the matter has not been mentioned by the US media since it was introduced in February. There has been a deafening silence: since February 2006, not a single article or editorial has appeared in print on the Universal National Service Act of 2006. Neither has it been the object of public debate. The bill has been referred to the House Armed Services Committee and the Subcommittee on Military Personnel."</ref> However, when after the Democratic victories in the November 2007 congressional elections, Rangel repeated his call for re-introduction of the draft and for moving forward on the bill<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/19/AR2006111900376_pf.html Rep.
