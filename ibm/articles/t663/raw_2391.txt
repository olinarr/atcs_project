'''Charles Bernard "Charlie" Rangel''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|r|æ|ŋ|ɡ|əl}};<ref>{{cite news|magazine=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|date=February 1, 1971|title=Black Lawmakers in Congress|page=122}}</ref> born June 11, 1930)<ref name=NYT-1974-12-12-VanGelder/> is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|NY|15}}, serving since 1971.  A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he is the [[List of members of the United States Congress by longevity of service#House time|third-longest currently serving member of the House of Representatives]]. As its most senior member, he is also the Dean of New York's congressional delegation. In January 2007, Rangel became Chair of the powerful [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Ways and Means Committee]], the first [[African-American]] to do so. He is also a founding member of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]].  . 

Rangel was born in [[Harlem]] in New York City, and had a somewhat troubled childhood.  He earned a [[Purple Heart]] and a [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] for his service in the [[U.S. Army]] during the [[Korean War]], where he led a group of soldiers out of a deadly [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese Army]] encirclement during the [[Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River|Battle of Kunu-ri]] in 1950.  Rangel graduated from [[New York University]] in 1957, and [[St. John's University School of Law]] in 1960.  He then worked as a private lawyer, [[United States Attorney|Assistant U.S. Attorney]], and legal counsel during the early-mid 1960s.  He served two terms in the [[New York State Assembly]], from 1967 to 1970, and then defeated long-time incumbent Congressman [[Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.]] in a primary challenge on his way to being elected to the House of Representatives.  . 

Once there, Rangel rose rapidly in the Democratic ranks, combining solidly [[American liberalism|liberal views]] with a pragmatic approach towards finding political and legislative compromises.  His long-time concerns with battling the importation and effects of illegal drugs led to his becoming chair of the House Select Committee on Narcotics, where he helped define national policy on the issue during the 1980s.  As one of Harlem's [[Gang of Four (Harlem)|"Gang of Four"]], he also became a leader in New York City and State politics.  He played a significant role in the creation of the 1995 [[Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone Development Corporation]] and the national Empowerment Zone Act, which helped change the economic face of Harlem and other inner-city areas.  Rangel is known both for his genial manner, with an ability to win over fellow legislators, and for his blunt speaking; he has long been outspoken about his views, and has been arrested several times as part of political demonstrations.  He was an adamant opponent of the [[George W. Bush administration]] and the [[Iraq War]], and he put forth proposals to reinstate [[Conscription in the United States|the draft]] during the 2000s.  . 

Beginning in 2008, Rangel faced a series of allegations of ethics violations and failures to comply with tax laws.  The [[United States House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct|House Ethics Committee]] focused on whether Rangel improperly rented multiple [[Rent control in New York|rent-stabilized New York apartments]], improperly used his office in raising money for the Rangel Center at the [[City College of New York]], and failed to disclose rental income from his villa in the [[Dominican Republic]]. In March 2010, Rangel stepped aside as Ways and Means Chair.  In November 2010, the Ethics Committee found Rangel guilty of 11 counts of violating House ethics rules, and on December 2, the full House approved [[Censure in the United States|a sanction of censure]] against Rangel.

In late November 1950, after the Chinese intervention into the war, this unit was caught up in heavy fighting in North Korea as part of the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)#Korean War|U.N. forces retreat from the Yalu River]].  In the [[Battle of Kunu-ri]], the 2nd Infantry was assigned to hold a road position near [[Kunu-ri]] while the rest of the [[Eighth United States Army|Eighth Army]] retreated to [[Sunchon, North Korea|Sunchon]], 21 miles further south.  On the night of November 29, the 2nd Infantry was attacked by gradually encircling forces of the [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese Army]], who set up a fireblock to cut off any U.S. retreat.  The eerie blare of Chinese night-fighting bugle calls and communication flares<ref>Fehrenbach, ''This Kind of War'', pp. 200–201. </ref> piercing the freezing air led to what Rangel later described as a "waking nightmare, scene by scene, and we couldn't see any possible way out of the situation."<ref>Rangel, ''And I Haven't Had a Bad Day Since'', p. 64. </ref>  During the day of November 30, the order came to withdraw the 2nd Infantry in phases, but the 503rd Artillery Battalion was sixth of eight in the order and could not get out in daylight when air cover was possible. <ref>Appleman, ''Disaster in Korea'', pp. 237–238. </ref>   . 

On the night of November 30, Rangel was part of a retreating vehicle column that was trapped and attacked by Chinese forces. <ref name=cbs-korea/><ref name="rangel-66"/>  In the subzero cold, Rangel was injured in the back by shrapnel from a Chinese shell. <ref name=nydn072795>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1995/07/27/1995-07-27_rangel_still_chilled_by_kore.html|title=Rangel Still Chilled By Korean War|author=Sisk, Richard|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|date=July 27, 1995}}</ref>  He later wrote that the blast threw him into a ditch and caused him to pray fervently to Jesus. <ref name="rangel-66"/>  Up and down the line of the retreat, unit cohesion disappeared under attack and officers lost contact with their men. <ref>Fehrenbach, ''This Kind of War'', pp. 225–226. </ref>  There was screaming and moaning around him and some U.S. soldiers were being taken prisoner,<ref name=nyt-1970-prof/> but despite feeling overwhelming fear Rangel resolved to try to escape over an imposing mountain: "From the rim of that gully it just looked like everything had to be better on the other side of that damn mountain."<ref name="rangel-66"/>  . 

Others nearby looked to Rangel, who though only a [[private first class]] had a reputation for leadership in the unit and had gained the nickname "Sarge". <ref name="rangel-66">Rangel, ''And I Haven't Had a Bad Day Since'', pp. 66–67. </ref>  Rangel led some 40 men from his unit over the mountain during the night and out of the Chinese encirclement. <ref name=nyt-1970-prof/> Other groups were trying to do the same, but some men dropped from the severe conditions or got lost and were never heard from again. <ref name="appleman-278">Appleman, ''Disaster in Korea'', pp. 277–278. </ref><ref>Fehrenbach, ''This Kind of War'', p. 234. </ref>  By midday on December 1, U.S. aircraft were dropping supplies and directions to Rangel's group and others, and had a raft ready to take them across the [[Taedong River]]; groups from the 503rd Artillery reached Sunchon that afternoon. <ref name="appleman-278"/><ref>Rangel, ''And I Haven't Had a Bad Day Since'', pp. 68–69. </ref>  Overall, no part of the 2nd Infantry suffered as many casualties as the artillery;<ref>Appleman, ''Disaster in Korea'', p. 237. </ref> it tried to save, but eventually lost, all its guns,<ref>Fehrenbach, ''This Kind of War'', p. 232. </ref> and nearly half of the battalion was killed in the overall battle. <ref>{{cite news | author=Hudson, Audrey | title=Veterans on Hill support Iraq hit | newspaper=[[The Washington Times]] | date=October 3, 2002 | url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-2081458/Veterans-on-Hill-support-Iraq.html | page=1}}</ref>  . 

Rangel was treated first at a field hospital, then moved to a general hospital well behind the lines in South Korea where he recuperated. <ref name="rangel-73">Rangel, ''And I Haven't Had a Bad Day Since'', pp. 69, 73–75. </ref>  He eventually returned to regular duty, then was rotated back to the U.S. in July 1951. <ref name="rangel-73"/> .

Rangel later viewed his time in the Army, away from the poverty of his youth, as a major turning point in his life: "When I was exposed to a different life, even if that life was just the Army, I knew damn well I couldn't get back to the same life I had left."<ref>{{cite news|title=[Rangel interview]|author=Milne, Emile|newspaper=[[The New York Post]]|date=April 3, 1971}}</ref>     .

==Early career==. 
===Legal===. 
After finishing law school, Rangel passed the state [[bar exam]] and was hired by Weaver, Evans & Wingate, the city's most prominent black law firm. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DF1F3EF932A25755C0A963958260|title=Saying Farewell to Roy Wingate|author=Pogrebin, Robin|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 11, 1995}}</ref>  Rangel made little money in private practice, but did build a positive reputation for providing legal assistance to black [[civil rights activist]]s. <ref name=cby-338/>  In 1961, Rangel was appointed [[United States Attorney|Assistant U.S. Attorney]] in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|Southern District of New York]] by [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]],<ref name=cby-338/> working under U.S. Attorney [[Robert Morgenthau]].  He stayed in that position for a year. <ref name=cby-338/> .

===Political===. 
He ran but lost for party district leader during an intense Democratic factional dispute in Harlem in 1963. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F40810F73B59137B93C6A81783D85F478685F9|title=Harlem Democrats Dig Up Hatchets Buried in '59|author=Robinson, Layhmond|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 14, 1963}}</ref>  In 1964, Rangel and the man who would become his political mentor, [[New York State Assembly]]man [[Percy Sutton]], co-founded the John F.

Rangel participated in the 1965 [[Selma to Montgomery marches]], marching for four days even though he had planned only a brief appearance. <ref name=nyt-1970-prof/>  He developed what ''[[The New York Times]]'' would label his irrepressible energy and joking self-mockery during this period. <ref name=nyt-1970-prof/> . 

Rangel was selected by Harlem Democrats to run for the [[New York State Assembly]] in 1966, representing the 72nd Legislative District in Central Harlem, after incumbent Sutton was named [[Manhattan Borough President]]. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F30617FE395F157A93CAA81782D85F428685F9|title=Democrats Name Harlem Lawyer|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 18, 1966}}</ref>  Rangel was victorious, and served two two-year terms there. <ref name=cby-338/>  He emerged as a leader among the black legislators in the state, and also became politically friendly with [[Governor of New York]] [[Nelson Rockefeller]], who arranged for Rangel to run on the Republican as well as Democratic ballot line during his 1968 re-election. <ref name=cby-338/>   . 

Rangel supported legalization of the [[numbers game]], saying "For the average Harlemite, playing numbers ... is moral and a way of life."<ref name=nyt-1970-prof/>  He also opposed harsher penalties on prostitutes, on grounds of ineffectiveness. <ref name=nyt-1970-prof/>  He was strongly concerned by the effects of drugs on Harlem, advocated that [[drug pusher]]s be held accountable for the crimes committed by their users, and in general believed the problem was at the level of a threat to [[national security]]. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00E12FA3858127B93C5A8178CD85F4D8685F9|title=Drug Ultimatum to Mideast Urged|author=Lissner, Will|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 17, 1969}}</ref><ref name=nyt110270/> .

He also failed to get on the ballot as an independent.

{{As of|2011}}, Rangel is the [[List of members of the United States Congress by longevity of service#House time|third-longest currently serving House member]], behind only [[John Dingell]] and [[John Conyers]].  . 

The strongest electoral challenge to Rangel came during his first re-election bid, in 1972, when he faced a Democratic primary challenge from [[HARYOU-ACT]] director Livingston Wingate, who had the backing of the old Powell organization and the [[Congress of Racial Equality]], a black nationalist group that Rangel publicly denounced. <ref name=cby-338/>  Rangel had the backing of the other Democratic power bases, however, and won the primary by a 3–to–1 margin<ref name=cby-339/> and the general election easily.  .

His district was numbered the Eighteenth District from 1971 to 1973; the Nineteenth District from 1973 to 1983; and the Sixteenth District from 1983 to 1993.  Presently numbered the Fifteenth, it is the smallest in the country in geographic size, encompassing [[Upper Manhattan]] and including such neighborhoods as [[Harlem]], [[Spanish Harlem, Manhattan|Spanish Harlem]], [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], [[Inwood, Manhattan|Inwood]], [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]], and part of the [[Upper West Side]], as well as a small portion of [[Queens]] in the neighborhood of [[Astoria, Queens|Astoria]].

As a freshman representative, Rangel focused on the drug issue, and was a member of the [[United States House Select Committee on Crime|House Select Committee on Crime]].  In February 1971, he criticized the [[Nixon administration]] for not taking stronger action against Turkey and France, the source and manufacture points for most of the heroin coming into the U.S. <ref name=cby-338/>  His proposal to halt foreign aid to countries not cooperating in the effort against international drug trafficking was unsuccessful, but did lead to a bill that authorized the president to reduce aid to such countries. <ref name=cby-338/>  Rangel created controversy in New York City by accusing some members of the [[New York Police Department]] of cooperating with drug pushers. <ref name=cby-338/> . 

On April 14, 1972, Rangel and [[Louis Farrakhan]] intervened in the investigation of the murder of New York Police Department patrolman Philip Cardillo, who was fatally shot in a Harlem [[Nation of Islam]] mosque where [[Malcolm X]] used to preach. Before a suspect could be taken into custody, Farrakhan and Rangel arrived at the scene, saying that a riot would likely occur if the suspect and others were not released. <ref name=cannato>{{cite book|last=Cannato|first=Vincent J.|title=The Ungovernable City: John Lindsay and His Struggle to Save New York|location=New York|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|year=2001|isbn=0465008437|pages=485–487}}</ref>  Some police officials also limited the investigation, including deputy commissioner for public affairs [[Benjamin Ward]], who had ordered all white police officers away from the scene in acquiescing to the demands of Farrakhan and Rangel. <ref name=cannato/> . 

Despite an initial impression that Rangel was mostly concerned with the "ghetto problems" of drugs and welfare, Rangel focused on many other issues as well. <ref name=nyt111279/>  He was a consistent backer of Israel, including objecting to an anti-Israeli resolution adopted at the [[National Black Political Convention]] in 1972<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10910F83455127B93C2AB178ED85F468785F9|title=Black Convention Eases Busing and Israeli Stands|author=Delaney, Paul|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 20, 1972|page=14}}</ref> and urging black Americans to support the [[History of the Jews in the Soviet Union|civil rights of Soviet Jews]] in 1975. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F3081FF8395E157493C6A8178FD85F418785F9|title=Blacks and Jews Viewed As Drawing Closer Again|author=Montgomery, Paul L.|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 14, 1975|page=1}}</ref>  In other respects, Rangel opposed foreign interventions and military spending, voting against bombing in [[Cambodia]] and against funding for the [[B-1 bomber]] and [[supercarrier]]s. <ref name=cby-339/> . 

In Congress, one of Rangel's first committee assignments was on the [[House Judiciary Committee]], where during the [[Watergate scandal]] he participated in the 1974 [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment hearings]] against President [[Richard Nixon]].  Rangel received both national attention and respect for his well-informed questioning style during the hearings. <ref name=NYT-1974-12-12-VanGelder/><ref name=bac-0/><ref name=cby-339/>  Rangel was also prominent in questioning Governor Rockefeller on his role in handling the [[Attica Prison riot]] during Rockefeller's vice presidential confirmation hearing. <ref name=NYT-1974-12-12-VanGelder/> . 

Rangel rose rapidly in the House, due to his political skills, hard work, knowledge of legislative matters, and genial manner. <ref name=cby-339/>  In 1974, he became the first black ever named to the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Committee on Ways and Means]],<ref name=NYT-1974-12-12-VanGelder/><ref name=nyt111279/> a position he assumed in 1975 (and left the Judiciary Committee),<ref name=nymag-2007/> and by 1979 had become the chairman of its important [[United States House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health|Subcommittee on Health]]. <ref name=cby-339/>  In 1976, he was named to the [[United States House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control|House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control]]. <ref name=cby-339/>  By 1979, Rangel was a member of the influential [[Steering and Policy Committee of the United States House of Representatives|House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee]]. <ref name=cby-339/>  Rangel combined his solidly liberal views–interest group ratings in 1978 indicated he was the most liberal member of the New York State congressional delegation–with a pragmatic approach towards finding political and legislative compromises. <ref name=cby-339/><ref name=nyt111279>{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40915FF385D11728DDDAB0994D9415B898BF1D3|title=Rangel Emerges as a Key Figure in City Politics; 'Koch Is Nasty to Everybody'|author=Rule, Sheila|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 12, 1979|page=B1|format=fee required}}</ref>  Rangel built alliances with others in Congress (collaborating for example with Michigan Republican [[Guy Vander Jagt]] on welfare reform measures), with people in governmental agencies, and with the [[Carter administration]]. <ref name=nyt111279/>  In some cases Rangel was criticized for being too pragmatic, such as when he switched his position on [[natural gas]] deregulation; Rangel denied that he did so in exchange for the authorization of a new federal building in Harlem. <ref name=nyt111279/>  Rangel said of himself, "I guess I'm practical, but you have to live with yourself and make sure you are not so practical that you sell out a part of yourself."<ref name=nyt111279/> . 

Besides his increasing influence in Washington, by the late 1970s Rangel was New York City's leading black political figure. <ref name=nyt111279/>  After initially endorsing [[Percy Sutton]] in the [[New York City mayoral election, 1977|1977 mayoral election]], he subsequently endorsed [[Ed Koch]] over [[Mario Cuomo]] in the Democratic primary run-off. <ref name=cby-340>''Current Biography Yearbook 1984'', p. 340. </ref>  He then attempted to mediate between Mayor Koch and some minority groups who thought the Koch administration racially insensitive.  As Koch related, "He has told some blacks angry with me: 'You say Ed Koch is nasty to you? I want you to know he's nasty to everybody.' I thought that was rather nice."<ref name=nyt111279/> . 

===1980s: Influential figure===. 
[[File:Charles Rangel Official Portrait.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Black-and-white photograph of Representative Rangel at an earlier age|Early official congressional portrait of Rangel]]
In 1981, Rangel shifted to become chairman of the [[United States House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight|Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight]], which gave him power in dealing with the [[Reagan administration]]'s cuts in [[United States welfare state|social spending]]. <ref name=cby-339/>  By 1983 he was the third-ranking member on Ways and Means, and worked well with its powerful chairman, [[Dan Rostenkowski]]. <ref name=cby-339/>  Rangel also became a protége of [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Tip O'Neill]], who made him [[Chief Deputy Whips of the United States House of Representatives|Deputy Majority Whip]] that same year. <ref name=cby-339/><ref name=nyt-1986-prof/>  In the [[United States presidential election, 1984]], Rangel supported former Vice President [[Walter Mondale]], rather than the primary campaign of [[Jesse Jackson]].   . 

By now, Rangel was known as one of the [[Gang of Four (Harlem)|"Gang of Four"]], who along with his old mentor [[Percy Sutton]], city and state figure [[Basil Paterson]], and future mayor [[David Dinkins]], were the most prominent politicians in Harlem. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/28/nyregion/28sutton.html|title=Percy E.

Rangel endorsed Koch for re-election in 1981, but by 1983 his relations with the mayor had broken down:<ref name=cby-340/> "I don't know anybody in politics that I dislike enough that I would recommend that he sit down with the mayor."<ref>{{cite news|title=[unknown]|author=Lombardi, Frank|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=July 24, 1983}}</ref>  By 1984, Rangel was the most influential black politician in New York State. <ref name=cby-337>''Current Biography Yearbook 1984'', p. 337. </ref>  His position on Ways and Means allowed him to bring federal monies to the state and city for transit projects, industrial development, [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] needs, [[low-income housing]], and shelters for the homeless. <ref name=cby-339/><ref name=cby-340/>  Rangel was one of the city's most recognizable politicians,<ref name=nyt071108/> and there was speculation that he would run for mayor in 1985, but Rangel preferred to remain in the House, with the goal of eventually becoming Ways and Means chairman and in the best possible case even House Speaker. <ref name=cby-340/>  Indeed, Rangel never showed any interest in a different political job other than being the Congressman from Harlem. <ref name=nymag-2007/> . 

In 1983, Rangel became chair of the Select Committee on Narcotics, which solidified his position as a leading strategist on this perennially important issue to him. <ref name=cby-339/><ref name=nyt-1986-prof/><ref name=bac-2007-sel/><ref name=ebony1289/>  Rangel kept the committee going, in the face of the usual pressure to disband special committees. <ref name=nyt-1986-prof/>  He battled against proposed cutbacks in the federal anti-drug budget, and advocated increased grants to states and cities for better shelters for the homeless. <ref name=bac-0/>  Rangel's amendments providing increased funding for state and local law enforcement were included in the [[Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986]]. <ref name=bac-0/>  He traveled to countries in Central and South America and elsewhere to inspect the sources of drugs and the law enforcement efforts against them; ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' magazine termed Rangel "a front-line general in the war against drugs."<ref name=ebony0389>{{cite news|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3NQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA128|title=Charles Rangel: The Front-Line General in the War on Drugs|author=Norment, Lynn|magazine=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|date=March 1989|pages=128–134}}</ref>  Rangel said "We need outrage!", making reference to the slow reaction by both government and religious leaders to the epidemics of [[crack cocaine]], [[heroin]], [[Phencyclidine|PCP]], and other drugs that hit American streets during the 1980s. <ref name=ebony0389/>  He believed that legalizing drugs would represent "moral and political suicide". <ref name=ebony0389/>  Nor did he refrain from criticizing those most affected by drugs, saying that Hispanic and black teenagers had no sense of self-preservation, and that [[drug dealer]]s were so stupid that they had to eat in fast-food places because they could not read a menu. <ref name=nyt-1995-prof/>  By 1988, Rangel was saying that President [[Ronald Reagan]] had not done enough in the war on drugs, but that First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]]'s "[[Just Say No]]" campaign had been quite valuable. <ref>{{cite news|title=Reagan urged to wage multi-faceted drug war|agency=[[United Press International]]|newspaper=[[Ellensburg Daily Record]]|date=March 1, 1988|page=6|unused_data=<!--url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3i0QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aI8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6486,6205256&dq=charles+rangel&hl=en -->}}</ref>  The narcotics committee itself was termed possibly the most important select committee of its time.

Rangel was part of the [[United States congressional conference committee|House–Senate joint conference]] that worked on the [[Tax Reform Act of 1986]], a simplifying overhaul that constituted the most sweeping reform of the [[Internal Revenue Code|U.S. tax code]] in 50 years. <ref name=nyt-1986-prof/>  In the negotiations, Rangel successfully argued for dropping more lower-income people from the tax rolls;<ref name=nyt-1986-prof/> the elimination of six million households from federal income taxation was hailed as wise policy by both liberal and conservative groups. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/22/business/major-help-found-in-tax-bill-for-low-income-households.html|title=Major Help Found in Tax Bill for Low-Income Households|author=Toner, Robin|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 22, 1986}}</ref>  Rangel authored the [[Low-Income Housing Tax Credit]] portion of the bill, which increased affordable housing in the U.S. <ref name=bac/>  He also played a key role in preserving the deductibility of state and local income taxes. <ref name="aap08-1170"/>  Rangel asserted that while beneficiaries of [[tax reform]] were not well organized, business interests opposed to it were.

During the 1991 [[Gulf War]], Rangel demanded that [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] [[Colin Powell]] investigate allegations of discrimination from black members of the [[New York Army National Guard]] regarding combat training and treatment.  During the [[Clinton administration]], Rangel did battle with executive branch officials over budget items almost as much as he had during Republican administrations,<ref name=time-lion/> and always resented when Clinton negotiated directly with Republicans while bypassing congressional Democrats. <ref name="aap08-1171"/>  In 1993, however, Rangel was a key sponsor of increases to the [[Earned Income Tax Credit]] that passed. <ref name="aap08-1170"/> . 

Rangel's dream of becoming chairman of Ways and Means took a tumble with the [[Republican Revolution]] of 1994, which took control of the House away from the Democrats for the first time in decades.  He did become the ranking Democrat of the committee in 1996. <ref name=nymag-2007/>  Rangel was bitterly opposed to the Republican [[Contract With America]], considering it an assault on America's poor, and strongly criticized Democrats such as President [[Bill Clinton]] and religious leaders such as [[John Cardinal O'Connor]] for perpetuating "the silence of good people" that he likened to what happened in [[Nazi Germany]]. <ref name=nyt-1995-prof/>  When Rangel made a similar allusion directed at new Ways and Means chair [[William Reynolds Archer, Jr.|Bill Archer]] in 1995, Archer refused to speak to him for several years except at public meetings. <ref name="aap08-1171">Barone and Cohen, ''The Almanac of American Politics 2008'', p. 1171. </ref>  Rangel also strongly opposed the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act|Welfare Reform Act of 1996]], accusing Clinton of supporting it for political reasons and predicting its consequences would cast a million children into poverty. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1996/08/01/1996-08-01_call_him_welfare_bill____pre.html|title=Call Him Welfare Bill: Prez Vows to Ink Historical Reform|author=Clifford, Timothy|author2=Eisenstadt, Dave|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=August 11, 1996}}</ref> . 

Opening up economic opportunities for minorities and the poor was a focus of Rangel's during the 1990s. <ref name=bac/>  His 1993 legislation created "[[empowerment zone]]s", which provided tax incentives for investment and job creation in inner urban areas;<ref name=bac/> it would eventually account for $5 billion in federal spending across the nation's cities. <ref name=ebony0707/><ref name=nyt071108/>  Rangel played a specific role in the creation of the 1995 [[Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone Development Corporation]], which led to a $500 million spending of public and private monies towards changing the face of Harlem, including gentrification effects. <ref name=nymag-2007/>  Rangel served on the corporation's board, and the effort was credited with helping the resurgence of Harlem that took place during the 1990s. <ref name="aap08-1169"/><ref name=nyt071108/> . 

In late 1998, when long-time Senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] of New York announced his retirement, Rangel was one of the first to advocate that [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] move to New York and run for the seat. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/apps/list/hearing/ny15_rangel/opedclintonharlem.html|title=Clinton Is Welcome in Harlem|author=Rangel, Charles|publisher=[[U.S. House of Representatives]]|date=February 14, 2001|unused_data=<!--accessdate=November 2, 2007-->}}</ref> She did so, successfully.

On March 15, 1999, the Congressman was arrested along with two other prominent [[African-American]] leaders (civil rights activist [[Al Sharpton]] and former [[Mayor of New York City|Mayor]] [[David Dinkins]]), for protesting the fatal shooting of [[Amadou Bailo Diallo|Amadou Diallo]], a 23-year-old immigrant to the United States from Guinea, by four [[White American|white]] and Hispanic New York City police officers. <ref>{{cite news|title=Dinkins, Rangel busted at Diallo protest|date=March 16, 1999|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|author=Sockwell, Ikimulisa|page=4}}</ref> The involved officers were later acquitted by a mixed-race jury.  .

During the early 2000s (decade) Rangel advocated continued funding of anti-poverty efforts, including [[Temporary Assistance for Needy Families]] and [[Child care and development block grant]]. Rangel also had an unproductive relationship with Ways and Means chairman [[Bill Thomas]], leading to an incident where Thomas called the [[United States Capitol Police]] on Rangel for having his members read a bill in the library, an action Thomas apologized for. <ref name=nymag-2007/><ref name="aap08-1171"/>  . 

Rangel sponsored the [[African Growth and Opportunity Act]], passed in 2000, despite the opposition of labor unions, the textile industry, and the Congressional Black Caucus. <ref name="aap08-1171"/>  It for the first time provided incentives for U.S. trade with [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. <ref name=bac/>  Indeed, Rangel became known for support of [[free trade]] agreements, in contrast to many House Democrats. <ref name=harlemglobetrotter/><ref name="aap08-1171"/>   .

Motivated by seeing few African American diplomats on his trips abroad,<ref name="aap08-1171"/> he founded the Charles B. Rangel International Affairs Program in 2002.

In April 2007, Rangel published his autobiography, ''... And I Haven’t Had a Bad Day Since: From the Streets of Harlem to the Halls of Congress'', whose title reflected his experience in Korea.  ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave it a favorable reviewing, saying it was "mercifully short on laundry lists [that some other political memoirs have], but long on sass and spirit."<ref name=nyt042207>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/books/review/Alterman.t.html?pagewanted=print|title=Lives of the Democrats|author=Alterman, Eric|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 22, 2007|authorlink=Eric Alterman}}</ref> .

===2008–2010: Ethics issues and censure===. 
====Letterhead use and Rangel Center fundraising====. 
In July 2008, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that Rangel was soliciting donations to the Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service at City College of New York from corporations with business interests before his Ways and Means Committee, and was doing so using Congressional [[letterhead]]. <ref name=wapo-first>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/14/AR2008071402546.html|title=Rangel's Pet Cause Bears His Own Name|author=Lee, Christopher|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=July 15, 2008}}</ref>  Such companies and individuals included [[AIG]], [[Donald Trump]], and [[Nabors Industries]], and by this time Rangel's efforts had helped raise $12&nbsp;million of the $30&nbsp;million goal for the center. <ref name=wapo-first/>  Government watchdog groups and ethics experts criticized Rangel's actions, with the dean of the [[George Washington University Graduate School of Political Management]] saying Rangel "has crossed the line". <ref name=wapo-first/> . 

Rangel denied any wrongdoing and asked the [[U.S. House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct]], commonly known as the House Ethics Committee, to determine if his use of Congressional [[letterhead]] while arranging meetings to solicit contributions for the Center had violated any House rules. <ref name=ap-asks>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Jul17/0,4670,RangelFundraising,00.html|title=Rangel invites ethics probe of his fundraising|agency=Associated Press|publisher=[[Fox News]]|date=July 17, 2008}}</ref>  House Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]] agreed to Rangel's request. <ref name=ap-asks/> . 

====Renting Harlem apartments at below-market rates====. 
''[[The New York Times]]'' reported in July 2008 that Rangel rents four apartments at below-market rates in the Lenox Terrace complex in Harlem. It reported that Rangel paid $3,894 monthly for all four apartments in 2007.  In contrast, the landlord's going rate for similar apartments in the building was as high as $8,125 monthly. Three adjacent apartments were combined to create his {{convert|2500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} home.  A fourth unit is used as a campaign office, which violates city and state regulations that require [[Rent control in New York|rent-stabilized]] apartments to be used as a primary residence. Rangel received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from one of the landlord’s owners, according to the paper. Rangel said his rent does not affect his representation of his constituents. <ref name=nyt071108/> . 

Congressional ethics experts said the difference in rent between what Rangel was paying and market rates, an estimated $30,000 per year, could be construed as a gift, exceeding the $100 House of Representatives gift limit. <ref name=nyt071108>Kocieniewski, David.

====House parking garage====. 
A September 2008 ''[[New York Post]]'' article reported that Rangel had been using a House parking garage as free storage space for his [[Mercedes-Benz]] for years, in apparent violation of Congressional rules. Under [[IRS]] regulations, free parking (here, worth $290 a month) is considered [[imputed income]], and must be declared on [[Tax return (United States)|tax return]]s. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/09182008/news/regionalnews/big_wheel_benz_the_rules_129646.htm|title=Big Wheel Benz The Rules|newspaper=New York Post|date=September 18, 2008|author=Retter, Daphne}}</ref></blockquote>  In July 2010 the House Ethics Committee ruled that Rangel had committed no violation, since in practice the parking policy was only applied to Congressional staff and not to members themselves. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2010/07/charlie-rangel-and-the-case-of.html|title=Charlie Rangel and the case of the idle Mercedes|author=Pershing, Ben|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=July 29, 2010}}</ref> . 

====Taxes on Dominican villa rental income====. 
Rangel was accused of failing to report income from his rental of a beachside villa he owns in [[Punta Cana]] in the [[Dominican Republic]].  A three-bedroom, three-bath unit, it has rented out for as much as $1,100 per night in the busiest tourist season. <ref>Vincent, Isabel; Edelman, Susan.

Labor lawyer [[Theodore Kheel]], a principal investor in the resort development company and frequent campaign contributor to Rangel, had encouraged him to purchase the villa. Rangel purchased it in 1988 for $82,750.  He financed $53,737.50 of the purchase price for seven years at an interest rate of 10.5%, but was one of several early investors whose interest payments were waived in 1990. <ref>Kocieniewski, David; and Halbfinger, David M.

In September 2008, Rangel's attorney, [[Lanny Davis]], disclosed that Rangel had failed to report on his tax returns or in congressional disclosure forms $75,000 in income he had received for renting his Dominican villa.  That month, Rangel paid $10,800 to cover his liability for the related [[back taxes]]. <ref>Kocieniewski, David.

On September 24, 2008, the House Ethics Committee announced that it would investigate whether Rangel had violated its [[code of conduct]] or any law or other regulation related to his performance of his duties. <ref>{{cite news | author=Kramer, Marcia | title=House To Launch Investigation Into Rep.

====Defense of tax shelter====. 
[[File:Charles Rangel with Gregory Slayton 2009.JPG|thumb|104px|left|upright|alt=refer to caption|Rangel receives book written by US [[Consul General]] [[Gregory Slayton]], in Bermuda in 2009]]
In November 2008, following reports by ''The New York Times'', Republican Congressmen asked the House Ethics Committee to look into Rangel's defense of a [[tax shelter]] approved by his Ways and Means Committee.  One of the four companies that benefited from the loophole was [[Nabors Industries]], which opened headquarters in [[Bermuda]] as a foreign corporation. <ref name="nytimes 11.25.2008">Kocieniewski, David. [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/26/nyregion/26rangel.html?_r=2 "Republicans Question Rangel’s Tax Break Support" ] ''The New York Times'', November 25, 2008. </ref>  Under the loophole, Nabors receives tens of millions of dollars in [[tax break]]s.  In 2004, Rangel had led opposition to the tax breaks. <ref name="nytimes 11.25.2008"/>  Nabors donated $1 million in 2006, and $100,000 later, to the City College of New York school named after Rangel.   . 

Its CEO said the donations were unrelated to Rangel's February 2007 promise to oppose closing the loophole. <ref name="nytimes 11.25.2008"/>  He denied there was any ''[[quid pro quo]]'', and called the article about it "malarkey". <ref>Flaherty, Peter, "[http://www.nlpc.org/stories/2009/06/05/nabors-chairman-gets-testy-flaherty-about-rangel-center-donation-calls-ny-times-%E2%80%98 Nabors Chairman Gets Testy With Flaherty About Rangel Center Donation; Calls NY Times 'Full of Malarkey']", [[National Legal and Policy Center]], June 5, 2009. <!--Retrieved June 8, 2009.--></ref>  Rangel said ''The New York Times'' had ignored facts and explanations, and denied the charges. <ref name="nytimes 11.25.2008"/><ref name=nyt-cdtb>Kocieniewski, David, "[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/25/nyregion/25rangel.html The Congressman, the Donor and the Tax Break]", ''The New York Times'', November 25, 2008. <!--Retrieved June 8, 2009.--></ref><ref name=pol120208>{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1208/16114.html|author=Bresnahan, John|newspaper=The Politico|date=December 2, 2008|title=Rangel takes on The New York Times|unused_data=<!--accessdate=February 26, 2010-->}}</ref>  The House Ethics Committee voted in December 2008, to expand its investigation of Rangel to the matter. <ref>Kocieniewski, David, "[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/10/nyregion/10rangel.html House Ethics Panel Expands Rangel Inquiry]", ''The New York Times'', December 10, 2008. <!--Retrieved June 8, 2009.--></ref>  Eventually the Ethics Committee would not make a specific charge over this matter but did include it in the supporting documentation for the overall charge that Rangel had solicited Rangel Center donations from those with business before his committee. <ref name=nyt-undisputed>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/16/nyregion/16rangel.html|title=Rangel Inquiry Finds Evidence Beyond Dispute|author=Kocieniewski, David|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 15, 2010}}</ref> . 

====Unreported assets and income====. 
On September 15, 2008, it was disclosed that: a) Rangel had omitted from his financial reports details regarding his sale of a Washington, DC home; b) discrepancies existed in the values he listed for a property he owns in [[Sunny Isles, Florida]] (varying from $50,000 to $500,000); and c) inconsistencies appeared in his [[investment fund]] reporting.  He apologized, saying "I owed my colleagues and the public adherence to a higher [[standard of care]], not only as a member of Congress, but even more as the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee."  Republicans called for his removal as chair.  Rangel said there was no justification for that, as the mistakes were errors of omission, that would not justify loss of his position. <ref>{{cite news | title=More Errors For Rep. Rangel; Hires New Account: Financial Paper's Problems Prompts Hiring Of Forensic Accounting Expert|publisher= [[WCBS-TV]] |date=September 15, 2008 | unused_data=<!--url=http://wcbstv.com/local/charles.rangel.uncle.2.817769.html -->}}</ref> . 

In August 2009, Rangel amended his 2007 financial disclosure form to report more than $500,000 in previously unreported assets and income.  That doubled his reported [[net worth]].  Unreported assets included a [[federal credit union]] checking account of between $250,000 and $500,000, several investment accounts, stock in [[Yum! Brands]] and [[PepsiCo]], and property in [[Glassboro, New Jersey]]. Rangel also had not paid [[property tax]]es on two of his New Jersey properties, which he was required by law to do.   . 

The ethics issues led by December 2008 to some loss of standing for Rangel, to Republicans trying to tie him to all Democrats, and to some Democrats privately saying it would be best if Rangel stepped down from his Ways and Means post. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/washingtonpostinvestigations/2008/12/ethics_questions_still_houndin.html?hpid=news-col-blog|title=Ethics Questions Still Hounding Rangel|author=Kravitz, Derek|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=December 2, 2008|unused_data=<!--accessdate=February 26, 2010-->}}</ref>  
In late 2008 and again in September 2009, the government [[watchdog group]] [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] named Rangel one of the 15 most corrupt members of Congress. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/09/16/2009-09-16_rep_charles_rangel_makes_most_corrupt_list__again.html|title=Rep.

On September 3, 2009, ''The Washington Post'' called on Rangel to resign his chairmanship of the House Ways and Means Committee, given the ethical issues that had surfaced. Another Republican resolution was put forth to force him out of his chairmanship. However, Rangel stayed in place and mostly maintained his role in House leadership and policy discussions,<ref name=pol100509>{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1009/27944.html|title=Charlie Rangel rides out storm – so far|author=Lerer, Lisa|author2=Allen, Jonathan|newspaper=The Politico|date=October 5, 2009|unused_data=<!--accessdate=February 26, 2010-->}}</ref> including the [[Affordable Health Care for America Act|Obama health care reform plan]]<ref name=time-lion>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1914697,00.html|title=Charles Rangel: The Lion of Harlem|author=Kolhatkar, Sheelah|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=August 6, 2009|unused_data=<!--accessdate=February 26, 2010-->}}</ref> (opposition to which, he suggested, was partly due to racial prejudice against President Obama). <ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/regional/item_ztFcDNxxgKhNWheKomzPON;jsessionid=9CC9B95E4DA5B72C57F0FE432B94CDE3 | title=Charlie ups the race-card ante | author=Campanile, Carl | newspaper=New York Post | date=September 3, 2009 | unused_data=<!--accessdate=December 31, 2010-->}}</ref> Nevertheless, his influence was diminished by the questions surrounding him. <ref name=time-lion/> . 

====Caribbean trips====. 
In May 2009, the non-profit [[National Legal and Policy Center]] filed an ethics complaint against Rangel and other members of Congress for trips, taken in 2007 and 2008 to [[Caribbean islands]].  The trips had been sponsored by Carib News Foundation, a New York non-profit funded by corporations with interests before Congress and the Ways and Means Committee. <ref name=abc022610/>  This, combined with the duration of the trips, seemed to violate House rules.  The Ethics Committee agreed the following month to investigate the matter. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/06/25/cbsnews_investigates/main5114378.shtml?source=related_story|title=Rangel Trips Under Investigation|author=Strickler, Laura|publisher=CBS News|date=June 25, 2009|unused_data=<!--accessdate=February 27, 2010-->}}</ref> . 

On February 26, 2010, the Ethics Committee issued its report. <ref name=hec-rpt-1>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/Press_Statement_Carib_News.pdf|title=Statement of the Chair and Ranking Republican Member of the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct Regarding Its Report in the Matter of the Carib News Foundation Multi-National Business Conferences in 2007 and 2008|publisher=[[United States House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct]]|date=February 26, 2010}}</ref>  It determined that Rangel had violated House gift rules, by accepting reimbursement for his travel to the conferences. <ref name=cnn022510>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/02/25/rangel.ethics/index.html?iref=allsearch|title=Rep.

Common sense dictates that members of Congress should not be held responsible for what could be the wrongdoing, or mistakes, or errors of staff. <ref name=abc022610/></blockquote>  . 

Pelosi said she would not take any action against Rangel pending further committee findings, as his staff had been more at fault and he had not broken any law. <ref name=abc022610>{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democratic-rep-charlie-rangel-admonished-breaking-house-rules/story?id=9954206|title=Democrats Join Republicans Calling for Rangel to Step Down|author=Karl, Jonathan|author2=Dwyer, Devin|publisher=ABC News|date=February 26, 2010|unused_data=<!--accessdate=February 27, 2010-->}}</ref>  The Ethics Committee continued to investigate the charges against Rangel relating to obtaining rent-stabilized apartments, fundraising, and failure to disclose rental income from his Dominican villa. <ref name=abc022610/> . 

====Stepping aside as House Ways and Means Chair====. 
After a February 2010 House Ethics Committee report criticizing him for taking sponsored Caribbean trips, the White House backed off its prior support of Rangel somewhat, and within days 14 Democratic members of Congress publicly called on Rangel to step aside as Ways and Means chair. <ref name=nydn022710>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2010/02/27/2010-02-27_dont_want_charles_in_charge_rangel_should_quit_chairman_post__dems.html|title=President Barack Obama abandons Rep.

Momentum quickly built against Rangel, with 30 or more Democrats planning to oppose his continued chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee, in a full House vote being pushed by Republicans. <ref name=wsj030310>{{cite news|title=Rangel Loses Support In House|author=Hitt, Greg|author2=Mullins, Brody|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=March 3, 2010|isbn=8281483235618|unused_data=<!--accessdate=March 3, 2010-->}} <!--{{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}} --></ref><ref name=nyp030410/>  Democrat [[Paul Hodes]] of New Hampshire noted: <blockquote>I think we're in a zero-tolerance atmosphere, and I think ... Washington should be held to the highest ethical standards. I have the greatest admiration for Mr. Rangel's service to this country. He's been a great public servant. This is very, very unfortunate, but I think it's necessary. <ref name=wsj030310/></blockquote> . 

On March 3, 2010, Rangel said he would take a [[leave of absence]] as chair, pending issuance of the Ethics Committee's report. <ref name=nyt030310>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/nyregion/04rangel.html|title=Rangel Steps Aside From Post During Ethics Inquiry|author=Hulse, Carl|author2=Herszenhorn, David M.|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 3, 2010|unused_data=<!--accessdate=March 3, 2010-->}}</ref> Pelosi granted his request, but whether such a leave was possible was unclear and the House [[Speaker pro Tempore]] said that a resignation had taken place and that Rangel was no longer chair. <ref name=resign-ruling>{{cite news|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/03/rangels-leave-may-not-be-temporary/|title=Rangel's 'Leave' May Not Be Temporary|author=Herszenhorn, David M.|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 3, 2010|unused_data=<!--accessdate=March 8, 2010-->}}</ref><ref name=nyt030310/> Observers opined that it was unlikely that Rangel would ever be able to regain the position. <ref name=nyp030410>{{cite news|author=Miller, S.A.|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/just_don_o4LUuhrmDip5pcpADAecPK|title=Scandal-stained Rangel quits post|newspaper=New York Post|date=March 4, 2010|unused_data=<!--accessdate=March 12, 2010-->}}</ref><ref name=nyt030310/>  Several Democrats said they would return or donate to charity campaign contributions given to them by Rangel. <ref name=nyp030410/>  Representative [[Sander M.

====House ethics committee charges====. 
On July 22, 2010, a bipartisan, four-member investigative subcommittee of the House Ethics Committee indicated it had "substantial reason to believe" that Rangel had violated a range of ethics rules relating to the other charges. <ref name=nyt-subs>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/23/nyregion/23rangel.html|title=A House Panel Will Try Rangel in Ethics Cases|author=Lipton, Eric|author2=Kocieniewski, David|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 23, 2010|page=A1}}</ref>  The matter was referred to another, newly created, special subcommittee to rule on the findings. <ref name=nyt-subs/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/07/22/house.rangel.ethics.hearing/index.html?iref=allsearch|title=Rangel faces a House ethics committee hearing|publisher=CNN|date=July 23, 2010|author=Walsh, Deirdre|author2=Keilar, Brianna}}</ref>   . 

Rangel negotiated with the Ethics Committee.  But participants in the talks characterized him as unwilling to admit wrongdoing in connection with several of the charges, and anxious about preserving his legacy.  No settlement was reached. <ref name=nyt-nego>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/24/nyregion/24rangel.html|title=Rangel in Talks on Settlement of Ethics Cases|author=Kocieniewski, David|author2=Lipton, Eric|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 24, 2010|page=A1}}</ref>  . 

On July 29, 2010, Rangel was charged by the committee with 13 counts of violating House rules and federal laws. <ref name=wapo13>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/29/AR2010072904083.html?hpid=topnews|title=Democrat Rangel charged with 13 ethics violations|author=Kane, Paul|author2=Pershing, Ben|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=July 30, 2010}}</ref>  Rangel's lawyers continued to insist that he had not intentionally violated any law or regulation, had not handed out political favors, and had not misused his office for personal financial gain. <ref name=wapo13/>  Rangel somberly said only this on the day the charges were announced: <blockquote>Sixty years ago, I survived a Chinese attack in North Korea. And as a result I wrote a book that, having survived that, that I haven't had a bad day since. Today I have to reassess that. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/07/29/rangel-offers-statement-ahead-of-ethics-hearing/?fbid=pl1Tyg2fQVT|title=Rangel offers statement ahead of ethics hearing|publisher=CNN|date=July 29, 2010}}</ref></blockquote> . 

====Re-election campaign of 2010====. 
By 2010, Rangel's continuing difficulties, together with the death a few months prior of [[Percy Sutton]] and the scandal around, and abandoned election campaign of, Governor [[David Paterson]] ([[Basil Paterson]]'s son), marked the end of the era of Harlem's "[[Gang of Four (Harlem)|Gang of Four]]". <ref name=time-g4/><ref name=nytwk4>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/28/weekinreview/28roberts.html|title=Paterson Scandal Scars a Piece of Harlem History|author=Roberts, Sam|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 28, 2010|page=WK4}}</ref> . 

Rangel faced several Democratic primary challengers for his seat in 2010: [[Vincent Morgan]], whose [[grassroots]] campaign bore many resemblances to Rangel's own against the scandal-plagued [[Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.]], in 1970;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/nyregion/17morgan.html|title=In a Challenge to Rangel, an Echo of His Rise|author=Roberts, Sam|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 16, 2010|page=A16}}</ref> [[Adam Clayton Powell IV (politician)|Adam Clayton Powell IV]], who had previously challenged Rangel in 1994; labor activist and past primary candidate for statewide office [[Jonathan Tasini]]; and former Obama campaign official Joyce Johnson. <ref name=nyt-reelect/><ref name=nyt-subs/>  While Rangel's fund-raising was down from previous years, and he had paid nearly $2 million in legal fees, he still had far more cash available for the campaign than any of his challengers. <ref name=nyt-reelect>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/nyregion/07rangel.html|title=In Harlem, the End for Rangel Appears Greatly Exaggerated|author=Barbaro, Michael|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 7, 2010|page=A1}}</ref><ref name=nyt-subs/>  . 

On September 14, 2010, Rangel prevailed in the primary election, gaining 51&nbsp;percent of the vote against Powell's 23&nbsp;percent and lesser amounts for the other contenders. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0910/42195.html|title=Rangel vanquishes challengers|author=Haberman, Maggie|newspaper=The Politico|date=September 15, 2010}}</ref>  He then won the November 2, 2010, general election easily, garnering 80&nbsp;percent of the vote against Republican [[Michel Faulkner]]'s 10&nbsp;percent and smaller amounts for third-party candidates. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://elections.msnbc.msn.com/ns/politics/2010/new-york/house/15|title=U.S. House New York, District 15|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=November 3, 2010}}</ref> . 

====House ethics trial and censure====. 
On November 15, 2010, Rangel's formal ethics trial began. <ref name=cbs111510>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20022788-503544.html|title=Rangel Walks Out of Ethics Trial, but Hearing Continues|author=Condon, Stephanie|publisher=CBS News|date=November 15, 2010}}</ref>  He walked out of the hearing at the start, saying that he was unable to afford representation after having paid his previous lawyers over $2&nbsp;million, and arguing unsuccessfully that the proceeding should be delayed until he could arrange for a legal defense fund. <ref name=cbs111510/> . 

The following day, Rangel was found guilty on 11 of the 12 charges against him by the adjudicatory subcommittee of the House Ethics Committee (2 of the original 13 charges having been combined). <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rep-charles-rangel-ethics-trial-house-panel-deliberates/story?id=12159790|title=Rep.

Supporters of Rangel argued that by comparison with previous cases, a reprimand would be a more fitting punishment for Rangel's trangressions than censure. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1110/45642.html|title=Charles Rangel urges reprimand, not censure|author=Bresnahan, John|newspaper=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]|date=November 28, 2010}}</ref>  Rangel repeatedly insisted, as he had all along, that nothing he had done was with the aim of enriching himself. <ref name=nyt-full/>  It was to no avail.  On December 2, 2010, a motion was made in the full House to censure Rangel.  Ethics committee chair [[Zoe Lofgren]] emphasized that it was Rangel's "accumulation of actions" that warranted the stiffer penalty, and said that the treatment of Rangel should set a new precedent, not follow old ones. <ref name=wapo-full/>  A motion to amend the resolution in favor of reprimand was voted down 267–146. <ref name=nyt-full/>  The House of Representatives then voted 333–79 to censure Rangel. <ref name=wapo-full>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/02/AR2010120201626.html?hpid=topnews|title=House censures Rep.

===2011–present: Continuing on===. 
Republicans took over control of the House as the [[112th Congress]] began in January 2011, meaning Rangel would have lost his Ways and Means chair even without his ethics issues.  But he was not considered for the ranking member slot either, which after a contested election among the Democratic caucus had gone to former acting chair Sander Levin. <ref>{{cite news | url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2010/12/house-democrats-tap-richard-ne.html | title=House Democrats confirm Levin, reject Neal for House Ways and Means top spot | author=Sonmez, Felicia | newspaper=The Washington Post | date=December 9, 2010}}</ref>  Nor were his issues completely over; the [[National Legal and Policy Center]], which had acted against him before, filed a complaint with the [[Federal Election Commission]] alleging that he had improperly paid legal bills from a political action committee. <ref name="ap-fund">{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2010-12-28-rangel-fund_N.htm | title=Rangel establishes legal defense fund | agency=Associated Press | newspaper=USA Today | date=December 28, 2010}}</ref> To cover both ongoing and past legal expenses, he established a legal defense fund (whose creation was approved by the House Ethics Committee). <ref name="ap-fund"/> . 

In general, though, Rangel said that he wanted to "pick up the pieces and move on",<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/politicolive/1210/Rangel_lawmakers_knew_I_didnt_deserve_censure.html | title=Rangel: Members knew I didn't deserve censure | author=Gerstein, Josh | newspaper=Politico | date=December 5, 2010}}</ref> and he predicted that even though Republicans were in the majority again, they would have trouble uniting with newer members beholden to the [[Tea Party movement]]. <ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ny1.com/content/news_beats/politics/131607/rangel--debt-ceiling-debate-will-test-tea-party/ | title=Rangel: Debt Ceiling Debate Will Test Tea Party | publisher=[[NY1 News]] | date=January 3, 2011}}</ref>   . 

During 2011, Rangel became the first member of Congress to declare support for the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement and made several visits to their nearby demonstration site in [[Zuccotti Park]]. <ref name="ch5-ows">{{cite news | url=http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/charles-rangel-on-occupy-wall-street-20111027 | title=Rep.

==Political positions==. 
Various [[advocacy group]]s have given Rangel scores or grades as to how well his votes align with the positions of each group. <ref group="nb">Mayer, William. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A28761-2004Mar27?language=printer "Kerry's Record Rings a Bell"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'' March 28, 2004. <!--Retrieved May 12, 2008:--> "The question of how to measure a senator's or representative's ideology is one that political scientists regularly need to answer. For more than 30 years, the standard method for gauging ideology has been to use the annual ratings of lawmakers' votes by various interest groups, notably the Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) and the American Conservative Union (ACU)."</ref>  Overall, as of 2003, Rangel had an average lifetime 91&nbsp;percent "Liberal Quotient" from [[Americans for Democratic Action]]. <!-- ADA doesn't give these in their yearly ratings, need to find more up-to-date figure -->  In contrast, the [[American Conservative Union]] assessed to Rangel a lifetime rating of less than 4&nbsp;percent through 2009. <ref>[http://www.conservative.org/ratings/ratingsarchive/2009/House%20Ratings.htm#NY "2009 U.S. House Votes"], [[American Conservative Union]]. Retrieved January 8, 2011. Lifetime rating is given. </ref>  ''[[National Journal]]'' rates congressional votes as [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] or [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] on the [[political spectrum]], in three policy areas: economic, social, and foreign. For 2005–2006, Rangel's averages were as follows: economic rating 91&nbsp;percent liberal and 6&nbsp;percent conservative, social rating 94&nbsp;percent liberal and 5&nbsp;percent conservative, and foreign rating 84&nbsp;percent liberal and 14&nbsp;percent conservative. <ref name="aap08-1168">Barone and Cohen, ''The Almanac of American Politics 2008'', p. 1168. </ref> . 

[[Project Vote Smart]] provides the ratings of many, many lesser known interest groups with respect to Rangel. <ref name=pvs-2009/>     Rangel typically has 100 ratings from [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]] and [[Planned Parenthood]]
and, inversely, 0 ratings or close to that from the [[National Right to Life Committee]]. <ref name=pvs-2009>{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=26979|title=Representative Charles B.

He has typically gotten very high ratings, in the 90s or 100, from the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], the [[Leadership Conference on Civil Rights]], and the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]]. <ref name=pvs-2009/>  The [[League of Conservation Voters]] has usually given Rangel around a 90 rating. <ref name=pvs-2009/>
[[Taxpayers for Common Sense]] has given Rangel ratings in the middling 40–50 range, while
the [[National Taxpayers Union]] has typically given Rangel very low ratings, or an 'F' grade. <ref name=pvs-2009/> .

[[File:Charles Rangel Chairman.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Official pose of Rangel holding a gavel, dressed in a suit and in front of an American flag|Rangel with his gavel in 2009, as Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.]]
Rangel is known as an energetic, genial, and sociable politician, one who is able to gain friendship and influence by means of charm, humor, and candor. <ref name=NYT-1974-12-12-VanGelder/><ref name=cby-339/><ref name=nyt-1986-prof/>  He is called "Charlie" by everyone in Congress, from the highest-ranking members to the custodial employees. <ref name=nyt-1986-prof/>  Of his political skills, 1980s Ways and Means chair [[Dan Rostenkowski]] said, "Charlie has the gifted knack of getting you to change your position, and you actually enjoy doing it. Compromising isn't so unusual in Congress. Enjoying it is."<ref name=nyt-1986-prof/>  The New York congressman's ability to use humor to catch others off guard before making a political point has been called "Rangeling" by lobbyists and others on Capitol Hill. <ref name=nyt-1986-prof/>  Many of his closest friends and allies in Congress have not been other African Americans, but white representatives from working class or rural districts; O'Neill aide [[Chris Matthews]] said these members were "tied emotionally and culturally to the people they represent."<ref name=nyt-1986-prof/>  . 

Rangel has been described as having a meticulous appearance. <ref name=time-lion/>  Long-time mentor [[Percy Sutton]] recalled, “In the beginning I called him Pretty Boy Rangel, to denigrate him, because he was one of those handsome types, hair pushed down and that mustache. But he had a way about him, with that great humor, an ability to influence people.”<ref name=nymag-2007/>  Later, ''[[The New York Times]]'' described him thusly: "After three decades in public life, the portly, gravel-voiced Mr. Rangel, who is very much the Old World-style gentleman yet sprinkles his sentences with mild profanity, still takes politics personally."<ref name=nyt-1995-prof/>  In contrast, Rangel and his office have long been disorganized, with criticism even from supporters for taking on more things than he can keep track of. <ref name=nyt-1986-prof/>  The congressman's life has been dominated by politics, with no hobbies and few friendships outside of it. <ref name=nyt-1995-prof/>  Loyalties to Rangel were severely tested during the height of the ethics investigations of him, when a number of political figures bailed out on a lavish 80th birthday gala planned for Rangel at New York's [[Plaza Hotel]]. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/06/nyregion/06rangel.html|title=For Rangel Birthday Party, A Shrinking Guest List|author=Barbaro, Michael|author2=Hernandez, Raymond|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 6, 2010|page=A17}}</ref> . 

Rangel is known for his blunt speaking and candor, which are rarely meant to be taken personally. <ref name=cby-339/>  This tendency has grown as he has gotten older and less bothered by what others think of him. <ref name=time-lion/>  When asked how he would like to be remembered, he said, "Well, as Rhett Butler once said in ''Gone With the Wind'', if I'm gone, quite frankly, I don't give a damn."<ref name=time-lion/>  In any case, he has fairly often made controversial remarks.  . 

Some have been linked to his caustic criticism of the Bush administration during the 2000s (decade).  For instance, his frustration over [[Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina|the slow federal response to Hurricane Katrina]] led him to compare, in September 2005, Bush to [[Bull Connor|a 1960s symbol of white opposition to the African-American civil rights movement]], stating: "George Bush is our Bull Connor."<ref name="nydn-cheney"/>  (Rangel's comparison was still being cited by political commentators several years later as an example of incendiary rhetoric. <ref>{{cite news | url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/node/461531 | author=Elder, Larry | title=How liberals 'know' Glenn Beck is racist | newspaper=[[The Washington Examiner]] | date=September 2, 2010 | authorlink=Larry Elder}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.mdjonline.com/view/full_story/9319942/article-Michelle-Malkin--Hurricane-Katrina-and-the-race-card--Five-years-later | author=Malkin, Michelle | title= Hurricane Katrina and the race card: Five years later | newspaper=[[Marietta Daily Journal]] | date=August 30, 2010 | authorlink= Michelle Malkin}}</ref>)  This led at the time to a public exchange of unpleasantries with Vice President [[Dick Cheney]],<ref name="aap08-1172"/> who said, "I'm frankly surprised at his comments. It almost struck me — they were so out of line, it almost struck me that there was some — Charlie was having some problem. Charlie is losing it, I guess."<ref name="nydn-cheney">{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2005/10/04/2005-10-04_veep__rangel_losing_it__rap_.html | title=Veep: Rangel Losing It, Rap Vs. W Shows | author=Bazinet, Kenneth R. | newspaper=New York Daily News | date=October 4, 2005}}</ref> Rangel responded by saying, "The fact that he would make a crack at my age, he ought to be ashamed of himself ... He should look so good at seventy-five."<ref>{{cite news|title=Rangel: Cheney should be 'ashamed' for age remark|agency=Associated Press|date=October 5, 2005|author=Kugler, Sara}}</ref>
Rangel again expressed his displeasure with the vice president in October 2006 – after Cheney had said that "Charlie doesn't understand how the economy works" – by opining that Cheney is "a real son of a bitch" who "enjoys a confrontation", and suggesting that Cheney required professional treatment for mental defects. <ref>{{cite news|title=Kerry Reloads in Dogfight Over Snipe at Troops in Iraq|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,226490,00.html|date=October 31, 2006|publisher=Fox News|unused_data=<!--accessdate=November 20, 2006-->}}</ref><ref name="usa-cheney">{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-10-31-kerry-whitehouse_x.htm | title=White House presses for Kerry apology | author=Jackson, David | newspaper=USA Today | date=November 1, 2006}}</ref>  The White House said that the vice president did not take Rangel's comments personally and had a "big hearty laugh" over them. <ref name="usa-cheney"/> . 

Rangel could sometimes find the other side; following the [[2006 Hugo Chávez speech at the United Nations]] in which the Venezuelan leader implied that Bush was the devil, Rangel said, "I want President Chávez to please understand that even though many people in the United States are critical of our president that we resent the fact that he would come to the United States and criticize President Bush ... you don't come into my country, you don't come into my congressional district and you don't condemn my president."<ref>{{cite news|title=Bush critics condemn Chavez's 'devil' remark |agency=Associated Press|first=Ian|last=James|date=September 22, 2006 | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14955193/ns/politics/ | publisher=MSNBC }}</ref> . 

Other remarks of Rangel's have revolved around Rangel's feelings about his home state and city, such as disparaging the state of Mississippi<ref group="nb">In November 2006, Rangel, in announcing some of his plans as new chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he planned to push more funds into his home state of New York. He added to this, "Mississippi gets more than their fair share back in federal money, but who the hell wants to live in Mississippi?" Mississippi Representative [[Chip Pickering]] demanded an apology and Rangel issued a statement declaring: "I certainly don't mean to offend anyone. I just love New York so much that I can't understand why everyone wouldn't want to live here." See {{cite news|last=Pettus|first=Emily Wagster|title=Miss. Congressman Wants Rangel Apology|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 10, 2006|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/10/AR2006111000415.html%7C<!--accessdate=April 7, 2007-->}}</ref> 
or suggesting that President Obama and First Lady [[Michelle Obama]] might be unsafe if they visited New York. <ref group="nb">In May 2009, when asked by the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' what President Obama and First Lady [[Michelle Obama]] should do during a visit to New York, Rangel replied, "Make certain he doesn't run around in East Harlem unidentified." Rangel said this following the accidental shooting of African-American [[New York Police Department]] officer Omar Edwards by Caucasian fellow officer Andrew Dunton, an incident of mistaken identity. See {{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/05/30/2009-05-30_mayor_michael_bloomberg_visits_brooklyn_home_of_slain_officer_omar_edwards.html|title=Rep.

This was a tragedy. Our police department is diverse, and they train; sometimes things happen and they're inexplicable. There's no reason to suspect this had any racial overtones."

See {{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/06/01/2009-06-01_charlie_rangel_says_hes_sorry_for_involving_the_obamas_in_controversial_racism_j.html|title=Charlie Rangel says he's sorry for involving the Obamas in controversial racism joke|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=June 1, 2009|first=Oren|last=Yaniv|unused_data=<!--accessdate=November 18, 2010-->}}</ref>
In both cases, apologies from the congressman followed. 
And some have just compounded problems that Rangel already had, such as remarks
after his ethics issues had started coming to light about Governor of Alaska and Republican vice presidential nominee [[Sarah Palin]] being "disabled" that were seen by some as insensitive in light of her family or as evidence that Rangel was out of control. <ref group="nb">In September 2008 – after spending a week avoiding reporters's questions on his ethics issues, by just giving his [[Third Geneva Convention|name, rank, and serial number]] –
while being interviewed by [[Marcia Kramer]] on [[WCBS-TV]], Rangel said of Governor of Alaska and Republican vice presidential nominee [[Sarah Palin]], "You got to be kind to the disabled." When Kramer pressed him on whether he really thought she was disabled, Rangel replied, "There's no question about it politically. It's a nightmare to think that a person's foreign policy is based on their ability to look at Russia from where they live."  New York Congressman [[Peter T. King|Pete King]] demanded that Rangel apologize, especially given that Palin's five month old son, Trig, suffered from [[Down syndrome]], saying, "Charlie owes a sincere apology to Sarah Palin and the entire disabled community. All of us know parents who have disabled children or relatives, so from any perspective this was wrong, wrong, wrong." Carr Massi, the president of [[Disabled in Action]], also criticized Rangel: "I am not one of [Palin's] fans, but I don't like the idea he referred to the woman as disabled. I mean he is talking about her politics – that word has no place there." Rangel suggested later in an interview with the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' that his comments were aimed at her thin foreign policy background and dismissed suggestions that he was talking about her newborn son as ridiculous.  The episode prompted ''[[The Politico]]'' to declare that "Rangel's off the rails."
