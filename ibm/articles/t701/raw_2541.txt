==History of term==. 
The term ''conservation biology'' was introduced as the title of a conference held at the [[University of California San Diego|University of California, San Diego]] in La Jolla, California in 1978 organized by biologists Bruce Wilcox and [[Michael E. Soulé]]. The meeting was prompted by the concern among scientists over tropical deforestation, disappearing species, eroding genetic diversity within species. <ref>J. Douglas. 1978. Biologists urge US endowment for conservation. Nature Vol. 275, 14 September 1978. Kat Williams . 1978. Natural Sciences. Science News. September 30, 1978. </ref> The conference and proceedings that resulted<ref name=ConsBiol80/> sought to bridge a gap existing at the time between theory in ecology and population biology on the one hand and conservation policy and practice on the other. <ref>Organization of the meeting itself also entailed bridging a gap between genetics and ecology. Soulé, was an evolutionary geneticist working with wheat geneticist Sir Otto Frankel to advance [[conservation genetics]] as a new field at the time. [[Jared Diamond]], who suggested the idea for a conference to Wilcox was concerned with the application of community ecology and island biogeography theory to conservation. Wilcox and [[Thomas Lovejoy]], who together initiated planning for the conference in June 1977 when Lovejoy secured a commitment of seed funding at World Wildlife Fund, felt both genetics and ecology should be represented. Wilcox suggested use of a new term  ''conservation biology'' to encompass the application of biological sciences in general to conservation. Subsequently, Soulé and Wilcox wrote in the program for the meeting they jointly convened on September 6–9, 1978, titled ''First International Conference on Resesarch in Conservation Biology'', "The purpose of this conference is to accelerate and facilitate the development of a rigorous new discipline called conservation biology -- a multidisciplinary field drawing its insights and methodology mostly from population ecology, community ecology, sociobiology, population genetics, and reproductive biology." This inclusion of topics at the meeting related to animal breeding reflected participation and support of the zoo and captive breeding communities. </ref> Conservation biology and the concept of biological diversity ([[biodiversity]]) emerged together, helping crystallize the modern era of conservation science and policy.  . 

==Description==. 
The rapid decline of established biological systems around the world means that conservation biology is often referred to as a "Discipline with a deadline". <ref>{{cite book |author=Wilson, Edward Raymond |title=The future of life |publisher=Little, Brown |location=Boston |year=2002 |isbn=0-316-64853-1 }}</ref> Conservation biology is tied closely to [[ecology]] in researching the [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]], [[wikt:migration|migration]], [[demographics]], [[effective population size]], [[inbreeding depression]], and [[minimum viable population|minimum population viability]] of [[rare species|rare]] or [[endangered species]]. <ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates">{{cite journal | url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html | author=Sahney, S.,  Benton, M.J. and Ferry, P.A. | year=2010 | title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | pmid=20106856 | journal=Biology Letters | pmc=2936204 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024 | volume = 6 | pages = 544–547 |format=PDF | issue=4}}</ref> To better understand the restoration ecology of native plant and animal communities, the conservation biologist closely studies both their [[polytypic]] and [[monotypic habitat]]s<ref>{{cite web |author=Theel Heather J., Dibble Eric D., Madsen John D. |title=Differential influence of a monotypic and diverse native aquatic plant bed on a macroinvertebrate assemblage; an experimental implication of exotic plant induced habitat |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=20189959 |publisher=Cat.Inist and Springer, Dordrecht, PAYS-BAS |year=1948 |accessdate=April 17, 2011}}</ref> that are affected by a wide range of benign and hostile factors.

Conservation biologists research and educate on the trends and process of biodiversity loss, species [[extinction]]s, and the negative effect these are having on our capabilities to [[Sustainability|sustain]] the well-being of human society. Conservation biologists work in the field and office, in government, universities, non-profit organizations and industry. They are funded to research, monitor, and catalog every angle of the earth and its relation to society. The topics are diverse, because this is an interdisciplinary network with professional alliances in the biological as well as social sciences. Those dedicated to the cause and profession [[advocate]] for a global response to the current [[Holocene extinction event|biodiversity crisis]] based on [[morals]], [[ethics]], and scientific [[reason]]. Organizations and citizens are responding to the biodiversity crisis through conservation action plans that direct research, monitoring, and education programs that engage concerns at local through global scales. <ref name="Soule86"/><ref name="Hunter96"/><ref name="Groom06" /><ref name="Dyke08"/> . 

==Context and trends==. 
Conservation biologists study trends and process from the [[paleontological]] past to the [[ecological]] present as they gain an understanding of the context related to [[species extinction]]. <ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"/> It is generally accepted that there have been five major global mass extinctions that register in Earth's history. These include: the [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction event|Ordovician]] (440 [[mya (unit)|mya]]), [[Late Devonian extinction|Devonian]] (370 mya), [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic]] (245 mya), [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event|Triassic–Jurassic]] (200 mya), and [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event|Cretaceous]] (65 mya) extinction spasms. Within the last 10,000 years, human influence over the Earth's ecosystems has been so extensive that scientists have difficulty estimating the number of species lost;<ref name="Ehrlich">{{cite book |author=Ehrlich, Anne H.; Ehrlich, Paul R. |title=Extinction: the causes and consequences of the disappearance of species |publisher=Random House |location=New York |year=1981 |isbn=0-394-51312-6 }}</ref> that is to say the rates of [[deforestation]], [[Coral reef#Destruction worldwide|reef destruction]], [[Wetland#Conservation|wetland draining]] and other human acts are proceeding much faster than human assessment of species. The latest ''[[Living Planet Report]]'' by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] estimates that we have exceeded the bio-regenerative capacity of the planet, requiring 1.5 Earths to support the demands placed on our natural resources. <ref name="WWFLPR">http://www.panda.org/news_facts/publications/living_planet_report/</ref> .

===Status of oceans and reefs===. 
{{See also|Ocean|Coral reef|Marine pollution|Marine conservation}} . 

Global assessments of coral reefs of the world continue to report drastic and rapid rates of decline. By 2000, 27% of the world's coral reef ecosystems had effectively collapsed. The largest period of decline occurred in a dramatic "bleaching" event in 1998, where approximately 16% of all the coral reefs in the world disappeared in less than a year. ''[[Coral bleaching]]'' is caused by a mixture of [[environmental stress]]es, including increases in ocean temperatures and [[Ocean acidification|acidity]], causing both the release of [[symbiotic]] [[algae]] and death of corals. <ref name="ausSOE01">{{cite book |title=Australia state of the environment 2001: independent report to the Commonwealth Minister for the Environment and Heritage |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |location=Collingwood, VIC, Australia |year=2001 |isbn=0-643-06745-0 |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/soe/2001/publications/report/pubs/part03b.pdf |author=Australian State of the Environment Committee.}}</ref> Decline and extinction risk in coral reef biodiversity has risen dramatically in the past ten years.

The oceans are threatened by acidification due to an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> levels. This is a most serious threat to societies relying heavily upon oceanic [[natural resource]]s. A concern is that the majority of all [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] species will not be able to [[Evolution|evolve]] or [[acclimate]] in response to the changes in the ocean chemistry. <ref>The Royal Society. 2005. Ocean acidification due to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Policy document 12/05. ISBN 0-85403-617-2 [http://royalsociety.org/displaypagedoc.asp?id=13539 Download]</ref> . 

The prospects of averting mass extinction seems unlikely when "[...] 90% of all of the large (average approximately ≥50 kg), open ocean tuna, billfishes, and sharks in the ocean"<ref name="Jackson" /> are reportedly gone. Given the scientific review of current trends, the ocean is predicted to have few surviving [[multi-cellular organism]]s with only [[microbes]] left to dominate [[marine ecosystem]]s. <ref name="Jackson" /> . 

===Groups other than vertebrates===. 
Serious concerns also being raised about [[Taxonomic rank|taxonomic groups]] that do not receive the same degree of social attention or attract funds as the vertebrates. These include [[fungus|fungal]] (including [[lichen]]-forming species)<ref name="fungal-conservation">{{cite web|url=http://www.fungal-conservation.org/blogs/orphans-of-rio.pdf |title=Orphans of Rio |publisher=fungal-conservation.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-09}}</ref>, invertebrate (particularly [[insect]]<ref name="Koh"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Thomas JA, Telfer MG, Roy DB, ''et al.'' |title=Comparative losses of British butterflies, birds, and plants and the global extinction crisis |journal=Science |volume=303 |issue=5665 |pages=1879–81 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=15031508 |doi=10.1126/science.1095046 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15031508|bibcode = 2004Sci...303.1879T }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Dunn RR |title=Modern Insect Extinctions, the Neglected Majority |journal=Conserv.

Conservation of fungi and conservation of insects, in particular, are both of pivotal importance for conservation biology. As mycorrhizal symbionts, and as decomposers and recyclers, fungi are essential for sustainability of forests. <ref name="fungal-conservation" /> The value of insects in the [[biosphere]] is enormous because they outnumber all other living groups in measure of [[species richness]]. The greatest bulk of [[biomass]] on land is found in plants, which is sustained by insect relations. This great ecological value of insects is countered by a society that oftentimes reacts negatively toward these aesthetically 'unpleasant' creatures. <ref>Edward O. Wilson. 1987. The Little Things That Run the World (The Importance and Conservation of Invertebrates). Conservation Biology, 1(4):pp. 344-346 [http://www.jstor.org/pss/2386020]</ref><ref>M. J. Samways. (1993). Insects in biodiversity conservation: some perspectives and directives. Biodiversity and Conservation, 2:258-282</ref> . 

One area of concern in the insect world that has caught the public eye is the mysterious case of missing [[honey bee]]s (''Apis mellifera''). Honey bees provide an indispensable ecological services through their acts of pollination supporting a huge variety of agriculture crops. The sudden disappearance of bees leaving empty hives or [[colony collapse disorder]] (CCD) is not uncommon. However, in  16-month period from 2006 through 2007, 29% of 577 [[beekeeper]]s across the United States reported CCD losses in up to 76% of their colonies. This sudden demographic loss in bee numbers is placing a strain on the agricultural sector. The cause behind the massive declines is puzzling scientists. [[Pest (organism)|Pests]], [[pesticide]]s, and [[global warming]] are all being considered as possible causes. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Holden C |title=Ecology.

Another highlight that links conservation biology to insects, forests, and climate change is the [[mountain pine beetle]] (''Dendroctonus ponderosae'') [[epidemic]] of [[British Columbia]], Canada, which has infested {{convert|470000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of forested land since 1999. <ref name="Running08">{{cite journal |author=Running SW |title=Climate change.

===Conservation biology of parasites===. 
{{Main|Conservation biology of parasites}}
A large proportion of parasite species are threatened by extinction. A few of them are being eradicated as pests of humans or domestic animals, however, most of them are harmless. Threats include the decline or fragmentation of host populations, or the extinction of host species.  .

==Concepts and foundations==. 
===Measuring extinction rates===. 
[[Image:Extinction intensity.svg|thumb|The five major extinction spasms measured by extinction levels in marine animal genera through time. Blue graph shows apparent percentage (not absolute number) of extinctions during any given time interval.]] . 

Extinction rates are measured in a variety of ways. Conservation biologists measure and apply [[statistical measure]]s of [[fossil record]]s,<ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"/><ref>http://www.bio.sdsu.edu/pub/regan/Currencyandtempo.pdf</ref> rates of [[habitat loss]], and a multitude of other variables such as loss of biodiversity as a function of the rate of habitat loss and site occupancy<ref>D. I. MacKenzie, J. D. Nichols, J. E. Hines, M. G. Knutson, and A. B. Franklin. (2003) Estimating site occupancy, colonization, and local extinction when a species is detected imperfectly. Ecology, 84(8): 2200–2207 [http://www.uvm.edu/envnr/vtcfwru/spreadsheets/occupancy/Occupancy%20Exercises/Exercise13/MacKenzie_et_al_2003.pdf]</ref> to obtain such estimates. <ref>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VJ1-484SKSD-1&_user=699447&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000039259&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=699447&md5=3d85353e94ab6da7ec8b2df07c0bdb92</ref> [[The Theory of Island Biogeography]]<ref>{{cite book |author=Wilson, Edward Raymond; MacArthur, Robert H. |title=The theory of island biogeography |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J |year=2001 |isbn=0-691-08836-5 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=R8kN1PWQZM8C&dq=theory+of+island+biogeography&printsec=frontcover}}</ref> is possibly the most significant contribution toward the scientific understanding of both the process and how to measure the rate of species extinction. The current [[background extinction rate]] is estimated to be one species every few years. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Raup DM |title=A kill curve for Phanerozoic marine species |journal=Paleobiology |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=37–48 |year=1991 |pmid=11538288 }}</ref> . 

The measure of ongoing species loss is made more complex by the fact that most of the Earth's species have not been described or evaluated. Estimates vary greatly on how many species actually exist (estimated range: 3,600,000-111,700,000)<ref name="Wilson00">{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = Edward O. | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 2000 | title = On the Future of Conservation Biology | url = | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 1–3 | doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.00000-e1.x}}</ref> to how many have received a [[Binomial nomenclature|species binomial]] (estimated range: 1.5-8 million). <ref name="Wilson00" /> Less than 1% of all species that have been described have been studied beyond simply noting its existence. <ref name="Wilson00" /> From these figures, the IUCN reports that 23% of [[vertebrate]]s, 5% of [[invertebrate]]s and 70% of plants that have been evaluated are designated as [[endangered]] or [[threatened]]. <ref name="IUCN">[http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1 IUCN Red-list statistics (2006)]</ref><ref>The IUCN does not disaggregate endangered from [[critically endangered]] or threatened for the purpose of these statistics. </ref> . 

===Systematic conservation planning===. 
Systematic conservation planning is an effective way to seek and identify efficient and effective types of reserve design to capture or sustain the highest priority biodiversity values and to work with communities in support of local ecosystems. Margules and Pressey identify six interlinked stages in the systematic planning approach:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Margules CR, Pressey RL |title=Systematic conservation planning |journal=Nature |volume=405 |issue=6783 |pages=243–53 |year=2000 |month=May |pmid=10821285 |doi=10.1038/35012251 |url=http://www.ecology.uq.edu.au/docs/SoC_Brazil_2005/Papers/Margules_and_Pressey_2000.pdf}}</ref> . 

# Compile data on the biodiversity of the planning region
# Identify conservation goals for the planning region
# Review existing conservation areas
# Select additional conservation areas
# Implement conservation actions
# Maintain the required values of conservation areas . 

Conservation biologists regularly prepare detailed conservation plans for [[Grant (money)|grant proposals]] or to effectively coordinate their plan of action and to identify best management practices (e.g. <ref>The Amphibian Conservation Action Plan is one example [http://web.archive.org/web/20070704172505/http://www.amphibians.org/newsletter/ACAP.pdf]. <br/>See also: {{cite journal |author=Chan KM, Shaw MR, Cameron DR, Underwood EC, Daily GC |title=Conservation Planning for Ecosystem Services |journal=PLoS Biol. |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=e379 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=17076586 |pmc=1629036 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040379 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040379}}</ref>). Systematic strategies generally employ the services of [[Geographic Information Systems]] to assist in the decision making process.  . 

===Conservation biology as a profession===. 
The [[Society for Conservation Biology]] is a global community of conservation professionals dedicated to advancing the science and practice of conserving biodiversity. Conservation biology as a discipline reaches beyond biology, into subjects such as [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[economics]], [[humanities]], [[arts]], [[anthropology]], and [[education]]. <ref name="Hunter96"/><ref name="Groom06" /> Within biology, [[conservation genetics]] and [[evolution]] are immense fields unto themselves, but these disciplines are of prime importance to the practice and profession of conservation biology.  . 

{{quote box
|[...] there are advocates and there are sloppy or dishonest scientists, and these groups differ. 
|Chan<ref name="Chan08">{{cite journal |author=Chan KM |title=Value and advocacy in conservation biology: crisis discipline or discipline in crisis? |journal=Conserv.

|width=25%
|align=left}} . 

Is conservation biology an [[Objectivity (science)|objective science]] when biologists [[advocate]] for an inherent [[Ecosystem valuation|value in nature]]? Do conservationists introduce [[bias]] when they support policies using qualitative description, such as [[Habitat degradation|habitat ''degradation'']], or ''healthy'' [[ecosystem]]s? As all scientists hold values, so do conservation biologists. Conservation biologists advocate for reasoned and sensible management of natural resources and do so with a disclosed combination of [[science]], [[reason]], [[logic]], and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] in their conservation management plans. <ref name="Hunter96" /> This sort of advocacy is similar to the medical profession advocating for healthy lifestyle options, both are beneficial to human well-being yet remain scientific in their approach. Many conservation biologists, in addition to having a [[Bachelors of Science]] (or extensive natural experience) often receive professional accreditation during their career (e.g. [http://www.apbbc.bc.ca/]).  . 

There is a movement in conservation biology suggesting a new form of leadership is needed to mobilize conservation biology into a more effective discipline that is able to communicate the full scope of the problem to society at large. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Manolis JC, Chan KM, Finkelstein ME, Stephens S, Nelson CR, Grant JB, Dombeck MP |title=Leadership: A new frontier in conservation science |journal=Conserv. Biol. |year=2009 }}</ref> The movement proposes an adaptive leadership approach that parallels an adaptive management approach. The concept is based on a new philosophy or leadership theory steering away from historical notions of power, authority, and dominance. Adaptive conservation leadership is reflective and more equitable as it applies to any member of society who can mobilize others toward meaningful change using communication techniques that are inspiring, purposeful, and collegial. Adaptive conservation leadership and mentoring programs are being implemented by conservation biologists through organizations such as the Aldo Leopold Leadership Program<ref>http://leopoldleadership.org/content/</ref> . 

===Approaches===. 
Conservation may be classified as either [[in-situ conservation]], which is protecting an endangered species in its natural [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]], or [[ex-situ conservation]], which occurs outside the natural habitat. In-situ conservation involves protecting or cleaning up the habitat itself which may include a great deal of [[environmental preservation]], or by defending the species from [[predator]]s. Ex-situ conservation may be used on some or all of the population, when in-situ conservation is too difficult, or impossible.  . 

Also, non-interference may be used, which is termed a [[preservationist]] method. Preservationists advocate for giving areas of nature and species a protected existence that halts interference from the humans. <ref name="Hunter96"/> In this regard, conservationists differ from preservationists in the social dimension, as conservation biology engages society and seeks equitable solutions for both society and ecosystems.  . 

Some preservationists emphasize the potential of biodiversity in a world without humans {{quote|"Animals have not yet invaded 2/3 of Earth's habitats, and it could be that without human influence the diversity of tetrapods will continue to increase in an exponential fashion."|Sahney ''et al''. <ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/>}} . 

===Ethics and values===. 
{{See also|Conservation (ethic)|Land ethic}} . 

Conservation biologists are [[interdisciplinary]] researchers that practice ethics in the biological and social sciences. Chan states<ref name="Chan08" /> that conservationists must advocate for biodiversity and can do so in a scientifically ethical manner by not promoting simultaneous advocacy against other competing values. A conservationist researches biodiversity and reasons through a Resource Conservation Ethic [http://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Evh1UD3ZYWcC&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=resource+conservation+ethic&ots=pK3JljX-PI&sig=aUpm1AbsZ3BLC1l5X8ioas3qbaw#PPA15,M1], which identify what measures will deliver "the greatest good for the greatest number of people for the longest time."<ref name="Hunter96" />{{Rp|13}} . 

Some conservation biologists argue that nature has an [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] that is independent of [[anthropocentric]] usefulness or [[utilitarianism]]. Intrinsic value advocates that a gene, or species, be valued because they have a utility for the ecosystems they sustain. [[Aldo Leopold]] was a classical thinker and writer on such conservation ethics whose philosophy, ethics and writings are still valued and revisited by modern conservation biologists. His writing is oftentimes required reading for those in the profession.  . 

===Conservation priorities===. 
[[Image:BiomassCharts.jpg|thumb|A pie chart image showing the relative biomass representation in a rain forest through a summary of children's perceptions from drawings and artwork (left), through a scientific estimate of actual biomass (middle), and by a measure of biodiversity (right). Notice that the biomass of social insects (middle) far outweighs the number of species (right).]] .

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has organized a global assortment of scientists and research stations across the planet to monitor the changing state of nature in an effort to tackle the extinction crisis. The IUCN provides annual updates on the status of species conservation through its Red List. <ref>www.iucnredlist.org</ref> The IUCN Red List serves as an international conservation tool to identify those species most in need of conservation attention and by providing a global index on the status of biodiversity. <ref name="Vié09">{{Cite document | last1 =Vié  | first1 = J.

While most in the community of conservation science "stress the importance" of [[sustainability|sustaining biodiversity]],<ref name="CREOcare">Committee on Recently Extinct Organisms. "[http://creo.amnh.org/care.html Why Care About Species That Have Gone Extinct?]". URL accessed July 30, 2006. </ref> there is debate on how to prioritize genes, species, or ecosystems, which are all components of biodiversity (e.g. Bowen, 1999). While the predominant approach to date has been to focus efforts on endangered species by conserving ''[[biodiversity hotspots]]'', some scientists (e.g)<ref name="Luck03">G. W. Luck, G. C. Daily and P. R. Ehrlich. (2003). Population diversity and ecosystem services. 18, (7): 331-336 [http://max2.ese.u-psud.fr/epc/conservation/PDFs/luck.pdf]</ref> and conservation organizations, such as the [[Nature Conservancy]], argue that it is more cost effective, logical, and socially relevant to invest in ''biodiversity coldspots''. <ref>In the paper referenced herein, the authors map biodiversity hotspots against ecosystem service values and show that published maps on biodiversity priority have a disproportionate share of ecosystem service value.

[http://www.uvm.edu/giee/publications/Turner%20et%20al.%20BioSci.%202007.pdf]</ref> The costs of discovering, naming, and mapping out the distribution every species, they argue, is an ill advised conservation venture. They reason it is better to understand the significance of the ecological roles of species. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Molnar J, Marvier M, Karieva P |title=The sum is greater than the parts |journal=Conserv. Biol. |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=1670–1 |year=2004 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00l07.x }}</ref> . 

Biodiversity hotspots and coldspots are a way of recognizing that the spatial concentration of genes, species, and ecosystems is not uniformly distributed on the Earth's surface. For example, "[...] 44% of all species of vascular plants and 35% of all species in four vertebrate groups are confined to 25 hotspots comprising only 1.4% of the land surface of the Earth."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Myers N, Mittermeier RA, Mittermeier CG, da Fonseca GA, Kent J |title=Biodiversity hotspots for conservation priorities |journal=Nature |volume=403 |issue=6772 |pages=853–8 |year=2000 |month=February |pmid=10706275 |doi=10.1038/35002501|bibcode = 2000Natur.403..853M }}</ref> . 

Those arguing in favor of setting priorities for coldspots point out that there are other measures to consider beyond biodiversity. They point out that emphasizing hotspots downplays the importance of the social and ecological connections to vast areas of the Earth's ecosystems where [[biomass]], not biodiversity, reigns supreme. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Underwood EC, Shaw MR, Wilson KA, ''et al.'' |title=Protecting Biodiversity when Money Matters: Maximizing Return on Investment |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=e1515 |year=2008 |pmid=18231601 |pmc=2212107 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001515 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0001515|bibcode = 2008PLoSO...3.1515U |editor1-last=Somers |editor1-first=Michael }}</ref> It is estimated that 36% of the Earth's surface, encompassing 38.9% of the worlds vertebrates, lacks the [[endemic species]] to qualify as biodiversity hotspot. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Leroux SJ, Schmiegelow FK |title=Biodiversity concordance and the importance of endemism |journal=Conserv.

Those in favor of the hotspot approach point out that species are irreplaceable components of the global ecosystem, they are concentrated in places that are most threatened, and should therefore receive maximal strategic protections. <ref>http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/Pages/default.aspx</ref> The [[IUCN Red List]] categories, which appear on Wikipedia species articles, is an example of the hotspot conservation approach in action; species that are not rare or endemic are listed the least concern and their wikipedia articles tend to be ranked low on the importance scale. This is a hotspot approach because the priority is set to target species level concerns over population level or biomass. <ref name="Wood08" /> Species richness and genetic biodiversity contributes to and engenders ecosystem stability, ecosystem processes, evolutionary [[adaptation|adaptability]], and biomass. <ref>The following papers are examples of research showing the relationship between biodiversity, biomass, and ecosystem stability:[http://nature.berkeley.edu/genomicswg/EE_twentyeight.pdf]<br/>{{cite journal |author=Cardinale BJ, Wright JP, Cadotte MW, ''et al.'' |title=Impacts of plant diversity on biomass production increase through time because of species complementarity |journal=Proc.

===Strategic species concepts===. 
====Keystone species====. 
{{Main|Keystone species}} . 

Some species, called a ''keystone species'', form a central supporting hub in the ecosystem. The loss of such a species results in a collapse in ecosystem function, as well as the loss of coexisting species. <ref name="Hunter96"/> The importance of a keystone species was shown by the extinction of the [[Steller's Sea Cow]] (''Hydrodamalis gigas'') through its interaction with [[sea otter]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, and [[kelp]]. [[Kelp bed]]s grow and form nurseries in shallow waters to shelter creatures that support the [[food chain]]. Sea urchins feed on kelp, while sea otters feed on sea urchins. With the rapid decline of sea otters due to [[overhunting]], sea urchin populations [[urchin barren|grazed unrestricted]] on the kelp beds and the ecosystem collapsed. Left unchecked, the urchins destroyed the shallow water kelp communities that supported the Steller's Sea Cow's diet and hastened their demise. <ref>P. K. Anderson. (1996). Competition, predation, and the evolution and extinction of Steller's Sea Cow, ''Hydrodamalis gigas''. Marine Mammal Science, 11(3):391-394</ref> The sea otter is a keystone species because the coexistence of many ecological associates in the kelp beds relied upon otters for their survival.  . 

====Indicator species====. 
{{Main|Indicator species}} . 

[[Image:NAMOSBC.jpg|thumb|The NAMOS BC logo is an example of an ecosystem ''umbrella'' concept (forests and wetlands) combined with amphibians as ''indicator'' and ''flagship species''. <!--{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} citation not necessary - the image itself provides the self evident fact-->]] . 

An ''indicator species'' has a narrow set of ecological requirements, therefore they become useful targets for observing the health of an ecosystem. Some animals, such as [[amphibian]]s with their semi-permeable skin and linkages to [[wetland]]s, have an acute sensitivity to environmental harm and thus may serve as a ''[[Domestic Canary#Miner.27s canary|miner's canary]]''. Indicator species are monitored in an effort to capture environmental degradation through pollution or some other link to proximate human activities. <ref name="Hunter96"/> Monitoring an indicator species is a measure to determine if there is a significant environmental impact that can serve to advise or modify practice, such as through different forest[[silviculture]] treatments and management scenarios, or to measure the degree of harm that a [[pesticide]] may impart on the health of an ecosystem.  . 

Government regulators, consultants, or [[NGO]]s regularly monitor indicator species, however, there are limitations coupled with many practical considerations that must be followed for the approach to be effective. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Landres PB, Verner J, Thomas JW |title=Ecological Uses of Vertebrate Indicator Species: A Critique |journal=Conserv. Biol. |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=316–28 |year=1988 |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/emc/nfma/includes/2007_rule/1988_12_Landres%20et%20al%201988.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1988.tb00195.x}}</ref> It is generally recommended that multiple indicators (genes, populations, species, communities, and landscape) be monitored for effective conservation measurement that prevents harm to the complex, and oftentimes unpredictable, response from ecosystem dynamics (Noss, 1997<ref name="Meffe97"/>{{Rp|88-89}}).  . 

====Umbrella and flagship species====. 
{{Main|Umbrella species|Flagship species}} . 

An example of an ''umbrella species'' is the [[Monarch (butterfly)|Monarch butterfly]], because of its lengthy [[Insect migration|migrations]] and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] value. The Monarch migrates across North America, covering multiple ecosystems and so requires a large area to exist. Any protections afforded to the Monarch butterfly will at the same time umbrella many other species and habitats. An umbrella species is often used as ''flagship species'', which are species, such as the [[Giant Panda]], the [[Blue Whale]], the [[tiger]], the [[mountain gorilla]] and the Monarch butterfly, that capture the public's attention and attract support for conservation measures. <ref name="Hunter96"/> .

Some historians have linked this with the 1916 National Parks Act, which included the 'use without impairment' clause, sought by John Muir. This eventually resulted in the removal of a proposal to build a dam in Dinosaur National Monument in 1959. <ref name="Davis96">{{cite book |author=Davis, Peter |title=Museums and the natural environment: the role of natural history museums in biological conservation |publisher=Leicester University Press |location=London |year=1996 |isbn=0-7185-1548-X }}</ref> . 

Natural resource conservation, however, has a history that extends prior to the age of conservation. Resource ethics grew out of necessity through direct relations with nature. Regulation or communal restraint became necessary to prevent selfish motives from taking more than could be locally sustained, therefore compromising the long-term supply for the rest of the community. <ref name="Dyke08"/> This social dilemma with respect to natural resource management is often called the "[[Tragedy of the Commons]]". <ref>{{cite journal |author=Hardin G |title=The Tragedy of the Commons |journal=Science |volume=162 |issue=3859 |pages=1243–8 |year=1968 |month=December |pmid=5699198 | url=http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/edu/dees/V1003/lectures/population/Tragedy%20of%20the%20Commons.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 |bibcode = 1968Sci...162.1243H }}</ref><ref>Also considered to be a consequence of evolution, where individual selection is favored over group selection.

===Early naturalists===. 
[[Image:White Gerfalcons.jpg|thumb|right|upright|White [[Gerfalcon]]s drawn by [[John James Audubon]]]] . 

[[Natural history]] was a major preoccupation in the 18th century, with grand expeditions and the opening of popular public displays in [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. By 1900 there were 150 natural history museums in [[Germany]], 250 in [[Great Britain]], 250 in the [[United States]], and 300 in [[France]]. <ref name="Farber00">{{cite book |author=Farber, Paul Lawrence |title=Finding order in nature: the naturalist tradition from Linnaeus to E.

The 19th century fascination with natural history engendered a fervor to be the first to collect rare specimens with the goal of doing so before they became extinct by other such collectors. <ref name="Evans97" /><ref name="Farber00" /> Although his artistic works and romantic depiction of avian life inspired many bird enthusiasts and conservation organizations, the writings of [[John James Audubon]], by modern standards, show insensitivity toward bird conservation as he shot and collected hundreds of specimens. <ref name="Farber00" /> Inspired by him, however, the first chapter of the [[Audubon Society]] started in 1905 for the purpose of protecting birds. <ref>http://www.audubon.org/centennial/timeline_intro.php#</ref> . 

===Coming of the Age of Conservation===. 
The modern concept of [[ecosystem services]] can be found in the late 19th century. "The utility of Natural History or its applicability to promote the material wealth of the State cannot be doubted. It was a great mistake to suppose that the subjects of Zoology, Botany, and Geology did not involve much that affects our comfort, convenience, health and wealth."<ref>Page 91, in C. D. Wilber. (1861). Transactions of the Illinois Natural History Society. Illinois Natural History Society. [http://books.google.ca/books?id=NcQYAAAAYAAJ&printsec=titlepage&client=firefox-a]</ref> However, the article continues and discusses the dread of agricultural pests and the utility of understanding their natural history for the purpose of facilitating their destruction.  .

By the early 19th century biogeography was ignited through efforts of [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Charles Lyell|Lyell]] and [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]];<ref>[http://web2.uwindsor.ca/courses/biology/macisaac/55-437/intro.htm Short history of biogeography and conservation biology]</ref> their efforts, while important in relating species to their environments, were part of the naturalist tradition and fell short of conservation biology proper.

===20th century conservation===. 
[[Image:Muir and Roosevelt restored.jpg|thumb|[[Theodore Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] and [[John Muir|Muir]] on [[Glacier Point]] in [[Yosemite National Park]].]] . 

In the 20th century, actions in the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], and [[Canada]] emphasized the protection of habitat areas pursuant to visions of such people as [[John Muir]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and [[Aldo Leopold]]. While the Canadian nor the United Kingdom governments did not pioneer the creation of National Parks as the United States did in the late 19th century, there were many far-sighted civil servants who were dedicated to wildlife conservation and of notable mention. Some of these historical figures include [[Charles Gordon Hewitt]] [http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/chronob/HEWI1885.htm] and [[James Harkin]]. <ref>For a review and introduction to the history of wildlife conservation and preservation in Canada, see {{cite book |author=Foster, Janet |title=Working for wildlife: the beginning of preservation in Canada |publisher=University of Toronto Press |location=Toronto |year=1997 |isbn=0-8020-7969-5 |edition=2nd |url=http://books.google.com/?id=8KLFOFGXvYQC&dq=Janet+Foster+working+for+wildlife&printsec=frontcover}}</ref> . 

The term ''conservation'' came into use in the late 19th century and referred to the management, mainly for economic reasons, of such natural resources as [[timber]], fish, game, [[topsoil]], [[pasture]]land, and minerals. In addition it referred to the preservation of forests ([[forestry]]), wildlife ([[wildlife refuge]]), parkland, [[wilderness]], and [[Drainage basin|watersheds]]. Western Europe was the source of much 19th century progress for conservation biology, particularly the British Empire with the [[Sea Birds Preservation Act 1869]]. However, the United States made contributions to this field starting with thinking of [[Thoreau]] and taking form with the [[Forest Act of 1891]], John Muir's founding of the [[Sierra Club]] in 1892, the founding of the [[New York Zoological Society]] in 1895 and establishment of a series of national forests and preserves by Theodore Roosevelt from 1901 to 1909. <ref>[http://www.runet.edu/~wkovarik/envhist/5progressive.html] Environmental timeline 1890-1920</ref> . 

Not until the mid-20th century did efforts arise to target individual species for conservation, notably efforts in [[big cat]] conservation in [[South America]] led by the New York Zoological Society. <ref>A.R. Rabinowitz, ''Jaguar: One Man's Battle to Establish the World's First Jaguar Preserve'', Arbor House, New York, N.Y. (1986)</ref> In the early 20th century the New York Zoological Society was instrumental in developing concepts of establishing preserves for particular species and conducting the necessary conservation studies to determine the suitability of locations that are most appropriate as conservation priorities; the work of Henry Fairfield Osborn Jr., [[Carl E. Akeley]], [[Archie Carr]] and [[Archie Carr III]] is notable in this era. <ref>{{cite book |author=Carr, Marjorie Harris; Carr, Archie Fairly |title=A naturalist in Florida: a celebration of Eden |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn |year=1994 |isbn=0-300-05589-7 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/chronob/OSBO1887.htm Henry Fairfield Osborn Jr. Biographical summary]</ref>{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}<!--The timings of these two sentences contradict each other.--> Akeley for example, having led expeditions to the [[Virunga Mountains]] and observed the [[mountain gorilla]] in the wild, became convinced that the species and the area were conservation priorities. He was instrumental in persuading [[Albert I of Belgium]] to act in defense of the [[mountain gorilla]] and establish [[Albert National Park]] (since renamed [[Virunga National Park]]) in what is now [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]. <ref>Akeley, C., 1923. ''In Brightest Africa'' New York, Doubleday. 188-249. </ref> . 

By the 1970s, led primarily by work in the United States under the [[Endangered Species Act]]<ref>U.S. Endangered Species Act (7 U.S.C. § 136, 16 U.S.C. § 1531 et seq.) of 1973, Washington DC, U.S. Government Printing Office</ref> along with the [[Species at Risk Act]] (SARA) of Canada, [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s developed in [[Australia]], [[Sweden]], the [[United Kingdom]], hundreds of species specific protection plans ensued. Notably the United Nations acted to conserve sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common heritage of mankind. The programme was adopted by the General Conference of [[UNESCO]] in 1972. As of 2006, a total of 830 sites are listed: 644 cultural, 162 natural. The first country to pursue aggressive biological conservation through national legislation was the United States, which passed back to back legislation in the Endangered Species Act<ref>[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode16/usc_sec_16_00001531----000-.html U.S. Endangered Species Act of 1966 with subsequent amendments]</ref> (1966) and [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (1970),<ref>[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=browse_usc&docid=Cite:+42USC4321 42 USC 4321 National Environmental Policy Act (2000): full text of the law]</ref> which together injected major funding and protection measures to large scale habitat protection and threatened species research. Other conservation developments, however, have taken hold throughout the world. India, for example, passed the [[Wildlife Protection Act of 1972]] [http://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0091-7648(199023)18%3A3%3C342%3ACAWEII%3E2.0.CO%3B2-%23].  . 

In 1980 a significant development was the emergence of the [[urban wildlife|urban conservation]] movement. A local organization was established in [[Birmingham]], [[UK]], a development followed in rapid succession in cities across the UK, then overseas. Although perceived as a [[grassroots movement]], its early development was driven by academic research into urban wildlife. Initially perceived as radical, the movement's view of conservation being inextricably linked with other human activity has now become mainstream in conservation thought. Considerable research effort is now directed at urban conservation biology. The [[Society for Conservation Biology]] originated in 1985. <ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=Evh1UD3ZYWcC&pg=PA2&dq=Fred+Van+Dyke+The+History+and+Distinctions+of+Conservation+Biology#PPA2,M1 | title = Conservation biology: Foundations, concepts, applications | isbn = 978-1-4020-6890-4 | author1 = Dyke | first1 = Fred Van | date = 2008-04-07}}</ref> . 

By 1992 most of the countries of the world had become committed to the principles of conservation of biological diversity with the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]];<ref>[http://www.biodiv.org/convention/default.shtml Convention on Biological Diversity Official Page]</ref> subsequently many countries began programmes of [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s to identify and conserve threatened species within their borders, as well as protect associated habitats. The late 1990s saw increasing professionalism in the sector, with the maturing of organisations such as the [[Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management]] and the [[Society for the Environment]].  . 

Since 2000 the concept of [[landscape scale conservation]] has risen to prominence, with less emphasis being given to single-species or even single-habitat focused actions. Instead an ecosystem approach is advocated by most mainstream conservationist, although concerns have been expressed by those working to protect some high-profile species.  . 

Ecology has clarified the workings of the [[biosphere]]; i.e., the complex interrelationships among humans, other species, and the physical environment. The [[overpopulation|burgeoning human population]] and associated [[agriculture]], [[industry]], and the ensuing pollution, have demonstrated how easily ecological relationships can be disrupted. <ref>{{cite book |author=Gore, Albert |title=Earth in the balance: ecology and the human spirit |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=1992 |isbn=0-395-57821-3 }}</ref> .
