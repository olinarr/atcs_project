'''Biocentrism''' (Greek: βίος, ''bio'', "life"; and κέντρον, ''kentron'', "center"), in a [[political]] and [[ecological]] sense, is an [[ethics|ethical]] point of view which extends [[inherent value]] to non-human [[species]],<ref name="case-studies-derr-21">{{cite book|last=Derr|first=Patrick George|coauthors=Edward M.

==Definition==. 
Biocentrism states that [[nature]] does not exist simply to be used or [[consumerism|consumed]] by humans, but that humans are simply one species amongst many,<ref name="alarm-bari-rev-ecology">{{cite journal|author=[[Judi Bari]]|date=1995|title=Revolutionary Ecology: Biocentrism & Deep Ecology|journal=Alarm: A Journal of Revolutionary Ecology|language=English|url=http://www.judibari.org/revolutionary-ecology.html}}</ref> and that because we are part of an [[ecosystem]], any actions which negatively affect the living systems of which we are a part, adversely affect us as well,<ref name="alarm-bari-rev-ecology" /><ref name="idiots-guide-ethics-201">{{cite book|last=Ingram|first=David|coauthors=Jennifer Parks|title=The complete idiot's guide to understanding ethics|publisher=Alpha Books|date=2002|pages=201|isbn=9780028643250|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0B4WNVdK_Q4C&pg=PA201&dq=biocentrism+ethics&ei=BW53S6C2KYr8lQTpnd3qBA&cd=4#v=onepage&q=biocentrism%20ethics&f=false|language=English}}</ref> ''whether or not'' we maintain a biocentric [[worldview]]. <ref name="alarm-bari-rev-ecology" /> Biocentrists believe that all species have [[inherent value]], and that humans are not "superior" in a [[morality|moral]] or [[ethical]] sense.  . 

[[Paul Taylor (philosopher)|Paul Taylor]], one of the major<ref name="eco-ethics-60" /> early proponents of biocentrism, maintains that biocentrism is an "attitude of respect for nature", whereby one attempts to make an effort to live one's life in a way that respects the welfare and inherent worth of all [[living creature]]s. <ref name="case-studies-derr-21" /> Taylor states that:<ref name="eco-ethics-60" /><ref name="taylor-respect-99">{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Paul|title=Respect for Nature: A Theory of Environmental Ethics|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|date=1986|pages=99|isbn=978-0691022505|language=English}}</ref> . 

# Humans are members of a community of life along with all other species, and on equal terms. 
# This community consists of a system of interdependence between all members, both physically, and in terms of relationships with other species
# Every organism is a "[[teleological]] centre of life", that is, each organism has a purpose and a reason for being, which is inherently "good" or "valuable"
# Humans are not inherently superior to other species . 

Advocates of biocentrism are likely to promote preservation of [[biodiversity]],<ref name="Env-Ethics-attfield-17">{{cite book|title=Environmental ethics: an overview for the twenty-first century|editor=Robin Attfield|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2003|pages=17|isbn=9780745627380|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bpU17ja7RGkC&pg=PA17&dq=biocentrism+ethics&ei=BW53S6C2KYr8lQTpnd3qBA&cd=9#v=onepage&q=biocentrism%20ethics&f=false|language=English}}</ref> [[animal rights]], and [[environmental protection]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} . 

The term has been used by those advocating "[[Left-wing politics|left]] biocentrism", combining [[deep ecology]] with an "[[Deindustrialization|anti-industrial]] and [[anti-capitalist]]" position ([[David Orton (deep ecology)|David Orton]] ''et al.''). <ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.ca.inter.net/~greenweb/lbprimer.htm |title=Left  Biocentrism  Primer |accessdate=2009-03-15 |author= |date=1998-03-15 |work= |publisher=}}</ref> . 

==History==. 
The term biocentrism is strongly associated with the work of the [[philosopher]] [[Paul Taylor (philosopher)|Paul Taylor]], especially his book ''Respect for Nature: A Theory of Environmental Ethics'' (1986). (ISBN 978-0691150246) <ref name="eco-ethics-60">{{cite book|last=Curry|first=Patrick|title=Ecological ethics: an introduction|publisher=Polity|date=2006|pages=60|isbn=9780745629087|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R6KqXAz4274C&pg=PA60&dq=biocentrism+ethics&lr=&ei=aHB3S77IFoTmlASH_5i5BA&cd=13#v=onepage&q=biocentrism%20ethics&f=false|language=English}}</ref> . 

However, historian [[Donald Worster]] has traced today's biocentric philosophies, which he sees as part of a recovery of a sense of kinship between man and [[nature]], to the reaction by the British [[intelligencia]] of the [[Victorian era]] against the [[stewardship (theology)|Christian ethic of dominion over nature]]. <ref name="Worster 1994">{{cite book| author = [[Donald Worster|Worster, Donald]]| title = Nature’s Economy: A History of Ecological Ideas (Studies in Environment and History)| publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | year = 1994| isbn = 0521468345}}</ref>
He has pointed to [[Charles Darwin]] as an important spokesperson for the biocentric view in [[ecological]] thought and quotes from Darwin's ''Notebook on Transmutation of Species''{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}:<blockquote>If we choose to let conjecture run wild, then animals, our fellow brethren in pain, diseases, death, suffering and famine — our slaves in the most laborious works, our companions in our amusement — they may partake of our origin in one common ancestor — we may be all netted together. </blockquote> .
