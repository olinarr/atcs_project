{{Evolutionary biology}}
In [[biology]] and [[ecology]], '''extinction''' is the end of an [[organism]] or of a group of organisms ([[taxon]]), normally a [[species]]. The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of the species, although the [[Functional extinction|capacity to breed and recover]] may have been lost before this point. Because a species' potential [[Range (biology)|range]] may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as [[Lazarus taxon|Lazarus taxa]], where a species presumed extinct abruptly "re-appears" (typically in the [[fossil|fossil record]]) after a period of apparent absence.  . 

Through [[evolution]], new species arise through the process of [[speciation]]—where new varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an [[ecological niche]]—and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition. The relationship between animals and their ecological niches has been firmly established. <ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates">{{ cite journal | url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html | author=Sahney, S.,  Benton, M.J. and Ferry, P.A. | year=2010 | title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | journal=Biology Letters | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024 | volume = 6 | pages = 544–547 |format=PDF | issue=4 | pmid=20106856 | pmc=2936204}}</ref> A typical species becomes extinct within 10 million years of its first appearance,<ref name="Newman">Newman, Mark.

A species becomes extinct when the last existing member dies. Extinction therefore becomes a certainty when there are no surviving individuals that are able to reproduce and create a new generation. A species may become [[functional extinction|functionally extinct]] when only a handful of individuals survive, which are unable to reproduce due to poor health, age, sparse distribution over a large range, a lack of individuals of both sexes (in [[sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]] species), or other reasons.  . 

Pinpointing the extinction (or [[pseudoextinction]]) of a species requires a [[Theory of species|clear definition of that species]]. If it is to be declared extinct, the species in question must be uniquely identifiable from any ancestor or daughter species, or from other closely related species. Extinction of a species (or replacement by a daughter species) plays a key role in the [[punctuated equilibrium]] hypothesis of [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]]. <ref>See: Niles Eldredge, ''Time Frames: Rethinking of Darwinian Evolution and the Theory of Punctuated Equilibria'', 1986, Heinemann ISBN 0-434-22610-6</ref> . 

In [[ecology]], ''extinction'' is often used informally to refer to [[local extinction]], in which a species ceases to exist in the chosen area of study, but still exists elsewhere. This phenomenon is also known as extirpation. Local extinctions may be followed by a replacement of the species taken from other locations; [[wolf reintroduction]] is an example of this. Species which are not extinct are termed [[Extant taxon|extant]]. Those that are extant but threatened by extinction are referred to as [[threatened]] or [[endangered species]].  . 

An important aspect of extinction at the present time are human attempts to preserve critically endangered species, which is reflected by the creation of the [[conservation status]] [[extinct in the wild|"Extinct in the Wild" (EW)]]. Species listed under this status by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) are not known to have any living specimens in the wild, and are maintained only in [[zoo]]s or other artificial environments. Some of these species are functionally extinct, as they are no longer part of their natural habitat and it is unlikely the species will ever be restored to the wild. <ref name="Maas">Maas, Peter. "[http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/wilduk.htm Extinct in the Wild" ''The Extinction Website''. URL accessed January 26 2007.]</ref> When possible, modern [[zoology|zoological]] institutions attempt to maintain a [[viable population]] for species preservation and possible future [[reintroduction]] to the wild through use of carefully planned [[breeding program]]s.  . 

The extinction of one species' wild population can have knock-on effects, causing further extinctions. These are also called "chains of extinction". <ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://theory.ph.man.ac.uk/~ajm/qui05a.pdf |title=Deleting species from model food webs |accessdate=2007-02-15 |format=PDF |work= |author=Quince, C. et al. |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060925092540/http://theory.ph.man.ac.uk/~ajm/qui05a.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-09-25}}</ref>  This is especially common with extinction of [[keystone species]].  . 

=== Pseudoextinction ===. 
{{Main|Pseudoextinction}} . 

Descendants may or may not exist for extinct species. Daughter species that evolve from a parent species carry on most of the parent species' [[genotype|genetic information]], and even though the parent species may become extinct, the daughter species lives on. In other cases, species have produced no new variants, or none that are able to survive the parent species' extinction. Extinction of a parent species where daughter species or subspecies are still alive is also called ''[[pseudoextinction]]''.  . 

Pseudoextinction is difficult to demonstrate unless one has a strong chain of evidence linking a living species to members of a pre-existing species. For example, it is sometimes claimed that the extinct ''[[Hyracotherium]]'', which was an early horse that shares a common ancestor with the modern [[horse]], is pseudoextinct, rather than extinct, because there are several [[Extant taxon|extant]] species of ''[[Equus (genus)|Equus]]'', including [[zebra]] and [[donkeys]]. However, as fossil species typically leave no genetic material behind, it is not possible to say whether ''Hyracotherium'' actually [[Evolution of the horse|evolved into more modern horse species]] or simply evolved from a common ancestor with modern horses. Pseudoextinction is much easier to demonstrate for larger taxonomic groups.  . 

== Causes ==. 
[[Image:Ectopistes migratoriusMCN2P28CA.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Passenger Pigeon]], one of hundreds of species of [[List of extinct birds|extinct birds]], was hunted to extinction over the course of a few decades.]] . 

As long as species have been evolving, species have been going extinct. It is estimated that over 99.9% of all species that ever lived are extinct. The average life-span of most species is 10 million years, although this varies widely between taxa. 
There are a variety of causes that can contribute directly or indirectly to the extinction of a species or group of species. "Just as each species is unique," write Beverly and [[Stephen C. Stearns]], "so is each extinction&nbsp;... the causes for each are varied—some subtle and complex, others obvious and simple". <ref name="Stearns">{{cite book | last = Stearns | first = Beverly Peterson and Stephen C. | title = Watching, from the Edge of Extinction | publisher = [[Yale University Press]] | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-300-08469-2 | pages=x |chapter=Preface }}</ref> Most simply, any species that is unable to [[Survival skills|survive]] or [[reproduction|reproduce]] in its environment, and unable to move to a new environment where it can do so, dies out and becomes extinct. Extinction of a species may come suddenly when an otherwise healthy species is wiped out completely, as when [[toxic]] [[pollution]] renders its entire [[habitat]] unliveable; or may occur gradually over thousands or millions of years, such as when a species gradually loses out in competition for food to better adapted competitors.  Extinction may take place a long time after the events that set it in motion, a phenomenon known as [[extinction debt]].  . 

Assessing the relative importance of genetic factors compared to environmental ones as the causes of extinction has been compared to the [[nature-nurture debate]]. <ref name="Raup" /> The question of whether more extinctions in the [[fossil]] record have been caused by [[evolution]] or by catastrophe is a subject of discussion; Mark Newman, the author of ''Modeling Extinction'' argues for a mathematical model that falls between the two positions. <ref name="Newman" /> By contrast, [[conservation biology]] uses the [[extinction vortex]] model to classify extinctions by cause. When concerns about [[human extinction]] have been raised, for example in Sir [[Martin Rees]]' 2003 book ''[[Our Final Hour]]'', those concerns lie with the effects of [[climate change]] or [[technology|technological]] disaster.  . 

Currently, environmental groups and some governments are concerned with the extinction of species caused by humanity, and are attempting to combat further extinctions through a variety of [[conservation movement|conservation]] programs. <ref name="MSNBC" /> Humans can cause extinction of a species through [[overharvesting]], [[pollution]], [[habitat destruction]], introduction of new [[predator]]s and food [[competitors]], overhunting, and other influences. Explosive, unsustainable human [[population growth]] is an essential cause of the extinction crisis. <ref>"[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=sixth-extinction Population Bomb Author's Fix For Next Extinction: Educate Women]". ''Scientific American''. August 12, 2008. </ref> According to the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN), 784 extinctions have been recorded since the year 1500 (to the year 2004), the arbitrary date selected to define "modern" extinctions, with many more likely to have gone unnoticed (several species have also been listed as extinct since the 2004 date). <ref name="IUCNno">{{cite web | publisher = [[World Conservation Union]] | url = http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/red_list_2004/GSAexecsumm_EN.htm | title = 2004 Red List | work = IUCN Red List of Threatened Species | accessdate = September 20, 2006 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080212161231/http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/red_list_2004/GSAexecsumm_EN.htm | archivedate = 12 February 2008}}</ref> . 

=== Genetics and demographic phenomena ===. 
{{See also|Extinction Vortex|Genetic erosion}}
[[Population genetics]] and demographic phenomena affect the evolution, and therefore the risk of extinction, of species. Limited geographic range is the most important determinant of [[genus]] extinction at background rates but becomes increasingly irrelevant as [[#Mass extinctions|mass extinction]] arises. <ref>{{cite journal| author=Payne, J.L. & S. Finnegan | year=2007 | title=The effect of geographic range on extinction risk during background and mass extinction | journal=[[PNAS|Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.]] | volume=104 | issue=25 | pages=10506–11 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0701257104 | pmid=17563357| pmc=1890565}}</ref> . 

[[Natural selection]] acts to propagate beneficial genetic traits and eliminate weaknesses. It is nevertheless possible for a deleterious mutation to be spread throughout a population through the effect of [[genetic drift]].  . 

Because traits are selected and not genes, the relationship between genetic diversity and extinction risk can be complex with factors such as [[balancing selection]], [[cryptic genetic variation]], [[phenotypic plasticity]], and [[degeneracy (biology)|degeneracy]] all playing potential roles.  . 

A diverse or deep [[gene pool]] gives a population a higher chance of surviving an adverse change in conditions. Effects that cause or reward a loss in [[genetic diversity]] can increase the chances of extinction of a species. [[Population bottleneck]]s can dramatically reduce genetic diversity by severely limiting the number of reproducing individuals and make [[inbreeding]] more frequent. The [[founder effect]] can cause rapid, individual-based speciation and is the most dramatic example of a population bottleneck.  .

=== Habitat degradation ===. 
{{Main|Habitat destruction}}
Habitat degradation is currently the main anthropogenic cause of species extinctions. The main cause of habitat degradation worldwide is agriculture, with urban sprawl, logging, mining and some fishing practices close behind. The degradation of a species' [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] may alter the [[fitness landscape]] to such an extent that the species is no longer able to survive and becomes extinct. This may occur by direct effects, such as the environment becoming [[toxicity|toxic]], or indirectly, by limiting a species' ability to compete effectively for diminished resources or against new competitor species.  . 

Habitat degradation through toxicity can kill off a species very rapidly, by killing all living members through [[contamination]] or [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] them. It can also occur over longer periods at lower toxicity levels by affecting life span, reproductive capacity, or competitiveness.  . 

Habitat degradation can also take the form of a physical destruction of niche habitats. The widespread destruction of [[tropical rainforest]]s and replacement with open pastureland is widely cited as an example of this;<ref name="Wilson" /> elimination of the dense forest eliminated the infrastructure needed by many species to survive. For example, a [[fern]] that depends on dense shade for protection from direct sunlight can no longer survive without forest to shelter it. Another example is the destruction of ocean floors by [[bottom trawling]]. <ref>{{cite book |last=Clover |first=Charles |year=2004 |title=The End of the Line: How overfishing is changing the world and what we eat |publisher=Ebury Press |location=London |isbn=0-09-189780-7 }}</ref> . 

Diminished resources or introduction of new competitor species also often accompany habitat degradation. [[Global warming]] has allowed some species to expand their range, bringing unwelcome competition to other species that previously occupied that area. Sometimes these new competitors are predators and directly affect prey species, while at other times they may merely outcompete vulnerable species for limited resources. Vital resources including [[water]] and food can also be limited during habitat degradation, leading to extinction.  . 

[[Image:Bufo periglenes2.jpg|thumb|The [[Golden Toad]] was last seen on May 15, 1989. [[Decline in amphibian populations]] is ongoing worldwide.]] . 

=== Predation, competition, and disease ===. 
In the natural course of events, species become extinct for a number of reasons, including but not limited to, extinction of a necessary host, prey or pollinator, inter-species competition, inability to deal with evolving diseases and changing environmental conditions (particularly sudden changes) which can act to introduce novel predators, or to remove prey. Recently in geologic time, humans have become an additional cause of extinction (many people would say premature extinction) for some species, either as a new mega-predator or by [[introduced species|transporting]] [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s from one part of the world to another.  The later has been occurring for thousands of years, sometimes deliberately (e.g., [[livestock]] released by sailors onto islands as a source of future food) and sometimes accidentally (e.g., [[rat]]s escaping from boats). In most cases, such introductions are unsuccessful, but when they do become established as an [[Invasive species|invasive alien species]], the consequences can be catastrophic. Invasive alien species can affect [[Endemic (ecology)|native]] species directly by eating them, competing with them, and introducing [[pathogen]]s or [[parasite]]s that sicken or kill them or, indirectly, by destroying or degrading their habitat. Human populations may themselves act as invasive predators. According to the "overkill hypothesis", the swift extinction of the [[megafauna]] in areas such as [[Australia]] (40,000 years before present), [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] (12,000 years before present), [[Madagascar]], [[Hawaii]] (300-1000 CE), and [[New Zealand]] (1300-1500 CE), resulted from the sudden introduction of human beings to environments full of animals that had never seen them before, and were therefore completely unadapted to their predation techniques. <ref name="Lee">Lee, Anita.

=== Coextinction ===. 
{{Main|Coextinction}}
[[Image:Giant Haasts eagle attacking New Zealand moa.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The large [[Haast's Eagle]] and [[moa]] from [[New Zealand]]]] . 

Coextinction refers to the loss of a species due to the extinction of another; for example, the extinction of [[parasitism|parasitic]] insects following the loss of their hosts. Coextinction can also occur when a species loses its [[pollinator]], or to [[predator]]s in a [[food chain]] who lose their prey. "Species coextinction is a manifestation of the interconnectedness of organisms in complex ecosystems&nbsp;... While coextinction may not be the most important cause of species extinctions, it is certainly an insidious one". <ref name="Koh">Koh, Lian Pih. ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', Vol 305, Issue 5690, 1632–1634, 10 September 2004. </ref>  Coextinction is especially common when a [[keystone species]] goes extinct. 
Models suggest that coextinction is the most common form of biodiversity loss. Coextinction allows for cascading effects across the trophic levels. Such effects are most severe in mutualistic and parasitic relationships. An example of coextinction would be the Haast's Eagle and the Moa. The Haast's Eagle is an example of a predator that became extinct because its food source became extinct. The moa were several species of flightless birds that served as a food source to the Haast's Eagle. <ref>{{Cite web | last = Dunn | first = Robert | coauthors = Nyeema Harris, Robert Colwell, Lian Pin Koh, Navjot Sodhi | title = Proceedings of the Royal Society | work = The sixth mass coextinction: are most endangered species parasites and mutualists? | publisher = [[The Royal Society]] | year = 2009 | url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/276/1670/3037.short | accessdate = April 20, 2011}}</ref> .

There have been at least five mass extinctions in the history of life on earth, and four in the last 3.5 billion years in which many species have disappeared in a relatively short period of geological time.

According to a 1998 survey of 400 biologists conducted by [[New York]]'s [[American Museum of Natural History]], nearly 70 percent believed that they were currently in the early stages of a human-caused extinction,<ref name="AMNH">[[American Museum of Natural History]].

In that survey, the same proportion of respondents agreed with the prediction that up to 20 percent of all living populations could become extinct within 30 years (by 2028). Biologist [[E. O. Wilson]] estimated <ref name="Wilson" /> in 2002 that if current rates of human destruction of the biosphere continue, one-half of all species of life on earth will be extinct in 100 years. <ref name="Ulansey">Ulansey, David, "[http://www.well.com/user/davidu/extinction.html The current mass extinction]" repeats this statement with links to dozens of news reports on the phenomenon.

In the 1750s when extinction was first described, the idea of extinction was threatening to those who held a belief in the [[Great Chain of Being]], a [[theology|theological]] position that did not allow for "missing links". <ref name="Viney" /> . 

The possibility of extinction was not widely accepted before the 1800s. <ref name="Viney">Viney, Mike.

== Human attitudes and interests ==. 
Extinction is an important research topic in the field of [[zoology]], and [[biology]] in general, and has also become an area of concern outside the scientific community. A number of organizations, such as the [[WWF (conservation organization)|Worldwide Fund for Nature]], have been created with the goal of preserving species from extinction. [[Government]]s have attempted, through enacting laws, to avoid habitat destruction, agricultural over-harvesting, and [[pollution]]. While many human-caused extinctions have been accidental, humans have also engaged in the deliberate destruction of some species, such as dangerous [[virus]]es, and the total destruction of other problematic species has been suggested.  Other species were deliberately driven to extinction, or nearly so, due to poaching or because they were "undesirable", or to push for other human agendas.  One example was the near extinction of the [[American bison]], which was nearly wiped out by mass hunts sanctioned by the United States government, in order to force the removal of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], many of whom relied on the bison for food. <ref name="Kotzman">{{cite book|author=C.

In modern times, commercial and industrial interests often have to contend with the effects of production on plant and animal life. However, some technologies with minimal, or no, proven harmful effects on ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' can be devastating to wildlife (for example, [[DDT]]). <ref name="INCHEM">International Programme on Chemical Safety (1989).

Governments sometimes see the loss of native species as a loss to [[ecotourism]],<ref name="Drewry">Drewry, Rachel.

[[Nature preserve]]s are created by governments as a means to provide continuing habitats to species crowded by human expansion. The 1992 [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] has resulted in international [[Biodiversity Action Plan]] programmes, which attempt to provide comprehensive guidelines for government biodiversity conservation. Advocacy groups, such as The Wildlands Project<ref name="WildlandsProject">[http://www.wild-earth.org/cms/page1090.cfm The Wildlands Project].

People who live close to nature can be dependent on the survival of all the species in their environment, leaving them highly exposed to extinction [[risk]]s. However, people prioritize day-to-day survival over species conservation; with human [[overpopulation]] in tropical [[developing country|developing countries]], there has been enormous pressure on forests due to [[subsistence agriculture]], including [[slash-and-burn]] agricultural techniques that can reduce endangered species's habitats. <ref>{{Cite book | first1= Anne | last1= Ehrlich | title = Extinction: The Causes and Consequences of the Disappearance of Species | publisher= Random House, New York | year= 1981 | isbn= 0-394-51312-6}}</ref> .

====Proposed==== . 

[[Olivia Judson]] is one of six{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} modern scientists to have advocated the deliberate extinction of specific species. Her September 25, 2003 ''[[New York Times]]'' article, "A Bug's Death", advocates "[[genocide|specicide]]" of thirty [[mosquito]] species through the introduction of a genetic element, capable of inserting itself into another crucial gene, to create [[recessive]] "[[Gene knockout|knockout genes]]". Her arguments for doing so are that the ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquitoes (which spread [[malaria]]) and ''[[Aedes]]'' mosquitoes (which spread [[dengue fever]], [[yellow fever]], [[elephantiasis]], and other diseases) represent only 30 species; eradicating these would save at least one million human lives per annum at a cost of reducing the [[genetic diversity]] of the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Culicidae]] by only 1%. She further argues that since species become extinct "all the time" the disappearance of a few more will not destroy the [[ecosystem]]: "We're not left with a wasteland every time a species vanishes. Removing one species sometimes causes shifts in the populations of other species&nbsp;— but different need not mean worse." In addition, anti-[[malaria]]l and [[Mosquito#Control|mosquito control programs]] offer little realistic hope to the 300 million people in [[developing nation]]s who will be infected with acute illnesses this year. Although trials are ongoing, she writes that if they fail: "We should consider the ultimate swatting."<ref name="Judson">{{cite news | last = Judson | first = Olivia | title = A Bug's Death | work = [[New York Times]] | date = September 25, 2003 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9805E5DF143DF936A1575AC0A9659C8B63&n=Top%2fNews%2fScience%2fTopics%2fMosquitoes | accessdate = 2006-07-30 }}</ref> . 

=== Cloning === . 

Ongoing technological advances have encouraged the hypothesis that by using DNA from the remains of an extinct species, through the process of [[Cloning#Cloning extinct and endangered species|cloning]], the species may be "brought back to life". Proposed targets for cloning include the [[dinosaurs]], the [[mammoth]], [[thylacine]], and the [[Pyrenean Ibex]]. In order for such a program to succeed, a sufficient number of individuals would have to be cloned, from the DNA of different individuals (in the case of sexually reproducing organisms) to create a viable population. Though [[bioethics|bioethical]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] objections have been raised,<ref>{{cite news |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2000/dec/24/news/mn-4250/2 |title= Cloned Goat Would Revive Extinct Line |author= A.

</ref> the cloning of extinct creatures seems a viable outcome of the continuing advancements in our science and technology. <ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/20/science/20mammoth.html?_r=1 |title= Regenerating a Mammoth for $10 Million |author= Nicholas wade |date= 2008-11-19  |accessdate=2010-05-17 | work=The New York Times}} ''The cell could be converted into an embryo and brought to term by an elephant, a project he estimated would cost some $10 million. "This is something that could work, though it will be tedious and expensive," ''
</ref> . 

In 2003, scientists attempted to clone the extinct [[Pyrenean Ibex]] (''C. p. pyrenaica''). This initial attempt failed; of the 285 embryos reconstructed, 54 were transferred to 12 mountain goats and [[mountain goat]]-[[Goat|domestic goat]] hybrids, but only two survived the initial two months of gestation before they too died. <ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/cloned-goat-dies-after-attempt-to-bring-species-back-from-extinction-1522974.html |title= Cloned goat dies after attempt to bring species back from extinction |author= Steve Connor |date= 2009-02-02 |work= [[The Independent]]   |accessdate=2010-05-17 | location=London}}</ref> In 2009, a second attempt was made to clone the Pyrenean Ibex; one clone was born alive, but died seven minutes later, due to physical defects in the lungs. <ref>{{cite news|title=Extinct ibex is resurrected by cloning|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/4409958/Extinct-ibex-is-resurrected-by-cloning.html|newspaper=Telegraph|date=31 Jan 2009}}</ref> . 

The concept of cloning extinct species was thought to be first popularized by the successful novel and subsequent film ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', though it may have been first used in [[John Brosnan]]'s 1984 novel ''[[Carnosaur (novel)|Carnosaur]]'', then in [[F. Paul Wilson|F. Paul Wilson's]] 1989 novel ''Dydeetown World,'' and later in [[Piers Anthony|Piers Anthony's ]] 1990 novel ''Balook'', which featured the resurrection of a ''[[Baluchitherium]]''.  .
