'''Biodiversity''' is the degree of variation of [[life]] forms within a given [[species]], [[ecosystem]], [[biome]], or an entire [[planet]]. Biodiversity is a measure of the [[ecological health|health of ecosystems]]. Biodiversity is in part a function of [[climate]]. In terrestrial habitats, [[tropical region]]s are typically rich whereas [[polar region]]s support fewer [[species]].  . 

Rapid environmental changes typically cause [[mass extinction]]s. One estimate is that less than 1% of the species that have existed on [[Earth]] are [[Extant taxon|extant]]. <ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1073/pnas.91.15.6758 | author=Raup, D.

Since life began on Earth, five major [[mass extinctions]] and several minor events have led to large and sudden drops in biodiversity. The [[Phanerozoic]] eon (the last 540&nbsp;million years) marked a rapid growth in biodiversity via the [[Cambrian explosion]]—a period during which nearly every [[phylum (biology)|phylum]] of [[multicellular organism]]s first appeared{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}.  The next 400&nbsp;million years included repeated, massive biodiversity losses classified as [[mass extinction]] events. In the [[Carboniferous]], [[rainforest collapse]] led to a great loss of plant and animal life. <ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse">{{cite journal | doi=10.1130/G31182.1 | url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/12/1079 | author= Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. & Falcon-Lang, H.J. | year=2010 | title= Rainforest collapse triggered Pennsylvanian tetrapod diversification in Euramerica | journal=Geology | volume = 38 | pages = 1079–1082 | format=PDF | issue=12}}</ref> The [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]], 251&nbsp;million years ago, was the worst; vertebrate recovery took 30&nbsp;million years. <ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction">{{cite journal | url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/qq5un1810k7605h5/fulltext.pdf | author=Sahney, S. and Benton, M.J. | year=2008 | title=Recovery from the most profound mass extinction of all time | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society: Biological | doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1370 | volume = 275 | pages = 759–65|format=PDF | pmid=18198148 | issue=1636 | pmc=2596898}}</ref> The most recent, the [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event]], occurred 65&nbsp;million years ago, and has often attracted more attention than  others because it resulted in the extinction of the [[dinosaur]]s. <ref>{{Cite journal | last=Bambach | first=R.K. | last2=Knoll | first2=A.H. | last3=Wang | first3=S.C. | title=Origination, extinction, and mass depletions of marine diversity | journal=Paleobiology | volume=30 | issue=4 | pages=522–42 |date = December 2004| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4067/is_200410/ai_n9458414/ |accessdate=2008-01-24 | doi=10.1666/0094-8373(2004)030<0522:OEAMDO>2.0.CO;2 | issn=0094-8373 | year=2004 }}</ref> . 

The period since the emergence of [[humans]] has displayed an ongoing biodiversity reduction and an accompanying loss of [[genetic diversity]]. Named the [[Holocene extinction]], the reduction is caused primarily by human impacts, particularly [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] destruction. Conversely, biodiversity impacts human health in a number of ways, both positively and negatively. <ref name="SalaMeyerson2009">{{cite book|last1=Sala|first1=Osvaldo E.|last2=Meyerson|first2=Laura A.|last3=Parmesan|first3=Camille|title=Biodiversity change and human health: from ecosystem services to spread of disease|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=x6WBmO8Muc4C&pg=PA2|accessdate=28 June 2011|date=26 January 2009|publisher=Island Press|isbn=978-1-59726-497-6|pages=3–5}}</ref> .

==Etymology==. 
The term biological diversity was used first by wildlife scientist and conservationist Raymond F. Dasmann in the 1968 lay book ''A Different Kind of Country''<ref>
Dasmann, R. F. 1968. A Different Kind of Country. MacMillan Company, New York.  ISBN 0-02-072810-7. </ref> advocating conservation. The term was widely adopted only after more than a decade, when in the 1980s it came into common usage in science and environmental policy. [[Thomas Lovejoy]], in the foreword to the book ''Conservation Biology'',<ref>
M. E. Soulé and B. A. Wilcox. 1980. Conservation Biology: An Evolutionary-Ecological Perspective. Sinauer Associates. Sunderland, Massachusetts. </ref> introduced the term to the scientific community. Until then the term "natural diversity" was common, introduced by The Science Division of [[The Nature Conservancy]] in an important 1975 study, "The Preservation of Natural Diversity." By the early 1980s TNC's Science program and its head, Robert E. Jenkins,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.org/aboutus/index.htm |title=Robert E. Jenkins |publisher=Nature.org |date=2011-08-18 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref> Lovejoy and other leading conservation scientists at the time in America advocated the use of "biological diversity".  . 

The term's contracted form ''biodiversity'' may have been coined by W.G. Rosen in 1985 while planning the 1986 ''National Forum on Biological Diversity'' organized by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (NRC). It first appeared in a publication in 1988 when entomologist [[E. O. Wilson]] used it as the title of the [[proceedings]]<ref>
Edward O.Wilson, editor, Frances M.Peter, associate editor, ''Biodiversity'', National Academy Press, March 1988 ISBN 0-309-03783-2 ; ISBN 0-309-03739-5 (pbk.), [http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309037395/html/R2.html online edition]</ref> of that forum. <ref>

Since this period the term has achieved widespread use among biologists, environmentalists, political leaders, and concerned citizens.  . 

A similar term in the United States is "natural heritage." It predates the others and is more accepted by the wider audience interested in conservation. Broader than biodiversity, it includes geology and landforms ([[geodiversity]]).  . 

==Definitions==.

"Biological diversity" or "biodiversity" can have many interpretations. It is most commonly used to replace the more clearly defined and long established terms, [[species diversity]] and [[species richness]].  Biologists most often define biodiversity as the "totality of genes, species, and ecosystems of a region". <ref name="Larsson2001">{{cite book|author=Tor-Björn Larsson|title=Biodiversity evaluation tools for European forests|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zeTU8QauENcC&pg=PA178|accessdate=28 June 2011|year=2001|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-87-16-16434-6|page=178}}</ref><ref name="Davis">{{cite book|author=Davis|title=Intro To Env Engg (Sie), 4E|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=n0FvYeoHtAIC&pg=SA4-PA40|accessdate=28 June 2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (India) Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-0-07-067117-1|pages=4–}}</ref> An advantage of this definition is that it seems to describe most circumstances and presents a unified view of the traditional three levels at which biological variety has been identified: . 

* [[species diversity]]
* [[ecosystem diversity]]
* [[genetic diversity]]
In 2003 Professor Anthony Campbell at [[Cardiff University]], [[UK]] and the Darwin Centre, [[Pembrokeshire]],  defined a fourth level: [[Molecular Diversity]]. <ref>{{Cite journal

This multilevel construct is consistent with Dasmann and Lovejoy. An explicit definition consistent with this interpretation was first given in a paper by Bruce A. Wilcox commissioned by the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] (IUCN) for the 1982 World National Parks Conference. <ref name=wilcox84>

''In National Parks, Conservation and Development, Proceedings of the World Congress on National Parks,, J.A. McNeely and K.R. Miller'',  Smithsonian Institution Press, pp. 18-30. </ref> Wilcox's definition was "Biological diversity is the variety of life forms...at all levels of biological systems (i.e., molecular, organismic, population, species and ecosystem)...". 
The 1992 [[United Nations]] [[Earth Summit]] defined "biological diversity" as "the variability among living organisms from all sources, including, 'inter alia', [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]], [[Marine (ocean)|marine]], and other [[marine biology|aquatic ecosystems]], and the ecological complexes of which they are part: this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems". <ref name="Hawksworth1996">{{cite book|author=D.

[[Geneticist]]s define it as the diversity of genes and [[organism]]s. They study processes such as [[mutation]]s, [[gene transfer]], and genome dynamics that generate evolution. <ref name=wilcox84/> . 

Measuring diversity at one level in a group of organisms may not precisely correspond to diversity at other levels. However, [[tetrapod]] (terrestrial [[vertebrates]]) taxonomic and ecological diversity shows a very close correlation. <ref name="Sahney, S. 2010">{{Cite journal| doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024| last1=Sahney |first1=S. |last2=Benton |first2=M.J. |first3=Paul |last3=Ferry

==Distribution==. 
[[Image:Swiss National Park 131.JPG|thumb|A [[Temperate coniferous forest|conifer forest]] in the [[Swiss Alps]] ([[Swiss National Park|National Park]]).]] . 

Biodiversity is not evenly distributed, rather it varies greatly across the globe as well as within regions. Among other factors, the diversity of all living things ([[biota (ecology)|biota]]) depends on temperature, precipitation, altitude, [[soil]]s, geography and the presence of other species. The study of the spatial distribution of [[organism]]s, [[species]], and [[ecosystem]]s, is the science of [[biogeography]].  . 

Diversity consistently measures higher in the [[tropics]] and in other localized regions such as [[Cape Floristic Province]] and lower in polar regions generally. In 2006 many species were formally classified as [[rare species|rare]] or [[endangered species|endangered]] or [[threatened species|threatened]]; moreover, scientists have estimated that millions more species are at risk which have not been formally recognized. About 40 percent of the 40,177 species assessed using the [[IUCN Red List]] criteria are now listed as threatened with [[extinction]]—a total of 16,119. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/05/0502_060502_endangered.html |title=Endangered Species List Expands to 16,000 |accessdate=2007-11-13 |work=}}</ref> . 

Generally terrestrial biodiversity is up to 25 times greater than ocean biodiversity. <ref>{{cite journal | author = Benton M.

===Latitudinal gradients===. 
{{Main|Latitudinal gradients in species diversity}} . 

Generally, there is an increase in biodiversity from the [[poles]] to the [[tropics]]. Thus localities at lower [[latitudes]] have more species than localities at higher latitudes. This is often referred to as the latitudinal gradient in species diversity. Several ecological mechanisms may contribute to the gradient, but the ultimate factor behind many of them is the greater mean temperature at the equator compared to that of the poles. <ref>Currie, D.

The island of [[Madagascar]], particularly the unique [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests]] and lowland rainforests, possess a high ratio of [[endemism]]. Since the island separated from mainland [[Africa]] 65 million years ago, many species and ecosystems have evolved independently.

Many regions of high biodiversity and/or endemism arise from specialized [[habitat]]s which require unusual adaptations, for example [[alpine climate|alpine]] environments in high [[mountain]]s, or [[Northern Europe]]an peat [[bog]]s.  . 

Accurately measuring differences in biodiversity can be difficult. [[Selection bias]] amongst researchers may contribute to biased empirical research for modern estimates of biodiversity. In 1768 Rev. [[Gilbert White]] succinctly observed of his [[Selborne|Selborne, Hampshire]] "all nature is so full, that that<!--"that" is correct--> district produces the most variety which is the most examined."<ref>White, ''The Natural History of Selborne'', letter xx 8 October 1768. </ref> . 

==Evolution==. 
{{Main|Evolution}}
[[Image:Phanerozoic Biodiversity.png|thumb|300px|Apparent marine fossil diversity during the Phanerozoic<ref name="Rosing2010">{{cite pmid|20360739}}</ref>]] . 

Biodiversity is the result of 3.5 billion years of [[evolution]].  The [[origin of life]] has not been definitely established by science, however some evidence suggests that life may already have been well-established only a few hundred million years after the [[age of the Earth|formation of the Earth]]. Until approximately 600 million years ago, all life consisted of [[archaea]], [[bacteria]], [[protozoan]]s and similar [[single-celled organism]]s.  . 

The history of biodiversity during the [[Phanerozoic]] (the last 540 million years), starts with rapid growth during the [[Cambrian explosion]]—a period during which nearly every [[phylum (biology)|phylum]] of [[multicellular organism]]s first appeared. Over the next 400 million years or so, invertebrate diversity showed little overall trend, and vertebrate diversity shows an overall exponential trend. <ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/> This dramatic rise in diversity was marked by periodic, massive losses of diversity classified as [[mass extinction]] events. <ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/> A significant loss occurred when rainforests collapsed in the carboniferous. <ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse"/> The worst was the Permo-Triassic extinction, 251 million years ago. Vertebrates took 30 million years to recover from this event. <ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"/> . 

The [[fossil record]] suggests that the last few million years featured the greatest biodiversity in [[History of Earth|history]]. <ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/> However, not all scientists support this view, since there is uncertainty as to how strongly the fossil record is biased by the greater availability and preservation of recent [[geology|geologic]] sections. Some scientists believe that corrected for sampling artifacts, modern biodiversity may not be much different from biodiversity 300 million years ago.,<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11353852 | year = 2001 | last1 = Alroy | first1 = J | last2 = Marshall | first2 = CR | last3 = Bambach | first3 = RK | last4 = Bezusko | first4 = K | last5 = Foote | first5 = M | last6 = Fursich | first6 = FT | last7 = Hansen | first7 = TA | last8 = Holland | first8 = SM | last9 = Ivany | first9 = LC | title = Effects of sampling standardization on estimates of Phanerozoic marine diversification | volume = 98 | issue = 11 | pages = 6261–6 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.111144698 | pmc = 33456 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|bibcode = 2001PNAS...98.6261A }}</ref> whereas others consider the fossil record reasonably reflective of the diversification of life. <ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/> Estimates of the present global macroscopic species diversity vary from 2 million to 100 million, with a best estimate of somewhere near 13–14 million, the vast majority [[arthropod]]s. <ref name=heywood>{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/ourplanet/imgversn/85/heywood.html |title=Mapping the web of life |publisher=Unep.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21}}</ref> Diversity appears to increase continually in the absence of natural selection. <ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/466318a}}</ref> . 

===Evolutionary diversification===. 
The existence of a "global carrying capacity", limiting the amount of life that can live at once, is debated, as is the question of whether such a limit would also cap the number of species. While records of life in the sea shows a [[logistic function|logistic]] pattern of growth, life on land (insects, plants and tetrapods)shows an [[exponential growth|exponential]] rise in diversity. As one author states, "Tetrapods have not yet invaded 64 per cent of potentially habitable modes, and it could be that without human influence the ecological and taxonomic diversity of tetrapods would continue to increase in an exponential fashion until most or all of the available ecospace is filled."<ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/> . 

On the other hand, changes through the [[Phanerozoic]] correlate much better with the [[Hyperbolic growth|hyperbolic]] model (widely used in [[population biology]], [[demography]] and [[macrosociology]], as well as [[fossil]] biodiversity) than with exponential and logistic models. The latter models imply that changes in diversity are guided by a first-order [[positive feedback]] (more ancestors, more descendants) and/or a [[negative feedback]] arising from resource limitation. Hyperbolic model implies a second-order positive feedback. The hyperbolic pattern of the [[world population]] growth arises from a second-order positive feedback between the population size and the rate of technological growth. <ref name="pmid18677962">{{cite journal |  pmid = 18677962 |  year = 2008 |  last1 = Markov |  first1 = AV |  last2 = Korotaev |  first2 = AV |  title = Hyperbolic growth of marine and continental biodiversity through the phanerozoic and community evolution |  volume = 69 |  issue = 3 |  pages = 175–94 |  journal = Journal of General Biology | url=http://elementy.ru/genbio/abstracts?artid=177}}</ref> The hyperbolic character of biodiversity growth can be similarly accounted for by a feedback between diversity and community structure complexity. The similarity between the curves of biodiversity and human population probably comes from the fact that both are derived from the interference of the hyperbolic trend with cyclical and [[stochastic]] dynamics. <ref name="pmid18677962"/><ref>

Most biologists agree however that the period since human emergence is part of a new mass extinction, named the [[Holocene extinction event]], caused primarily by the impact humans are having on the environment. <ref>[http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html National Survey Reveals Biodiversity Crisis] American Museum of Natural History</ref> It has been argued that the present rate of extinction is sufficient to eliminate most species on the planet Earth within 100 years. <ref name=Wilson2002>{{Cite book|title=The Future of Life|author=Edward O.

New species are regularly discovered (on average between 5–10,000 new species each year, most of them [[insect]]s) and many, though discovered, are not yet classified (estimates are that nearly 90% of all [[arthropod]]s are not yet classified). <ref name=heywood /> Most of the terrestrial diversity is found in [[tropical forest]]s.  .

===Leisure, cultural and aesthetic value===. 
Biodiversity enriches leisure activities such as [[hiking]], [[birdwatching]] or natural history study. Biodiversity inspires [[musician]]s, painters, sculptors, writers and other artists. Many cultures view themselves as an integral part of the natural world which requires them to respect other living organisms.  . 

Popular activities such as [[gardening]], [[fishkeeping]] and specimen collecting strongly depend on biodiversity. The number of species involved in such pursuits is in the tens of thousands, though the majority do not enter commerce.  . 

The relationships between the original natural areas of these often exotic animals and plants and commercial collectors, suppliers, breeders, propagators and those who promote their understanding and enjoyment are complex and poorly understood. The general public responds well to exposure to rare and unusual organisms, reflecting their inherent value.  . 

Philosophically it could be argued that biodiversity has intrinsic aesthetic and spiritual value to [[Human|mankind]] ''in and of itself''. This idea can be used as a counterweight to the notion that [[tropical forest]]s and other ecological realms are only worthy of conservation because of the services they provide.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} . 

===Ecological services===. 
{{See also|Ecological effects of biodiversity}}
[[Image:Eaglecreek-28July2006.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eagle Creek (Multnomah County, Oregon)|Eagle Creek]], Oregon hiking]] . 

Biodiversity supports many [[ecosystem services]] that are often not readily visible. It plays a part in regulating the chemistry of our [[atmosphere]] and [[water supply]]. Biodiversity is directly involved in [[water purification]], recycling [[nutrient]]s and providing fertile soils. Experiments with controlled environments have shown that humans cannot easily build ecosystems to support human needs; for example [[entomophily|insect pollination]] cannot be mimicked, and that activity alone represents tens of billions of dollars in [[ecosystem services]] per year to humankind.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} .

===Introduced and invasive species===. 
{{Main|Introduced species|Invasive species}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}
[[Image:Male Silver Pheasant.jpg|thumb|right|Male ''Lophura nycthemera'' ([[Silver Pheasant]]), a native of [[East Asia]] that has been introduced into parts of [[Europe]] for ornamental reasons]]
Barriers such as large [[rivers]], [[sea]]s, [[oceans]], [[mountains]] and [[deserts]] encourage diversity by enabling independent evolution on either side of the barrier. [[Invasive species]] occur when those barriers are blurred. Without barriers such species occupy new niches, substantially reducing diversity. Repeatedly humans have helped these species circumvent these barriers, introducing them for food and other purposes. This has occurred on a time scale much shorter than the eons that historically have been required for a species to extend its range.  . 

Not all introduced species are invasive, nor all invasive species deliberately introduced. In cases such as the [[zebra mussel]], [[invasive species|invasion]] of US waterways was unintentional. In other cases, such as [[mongoose]]s in [[Hawaii]], the introduction is deliberate but ineffective ([[nocturnal]] [[rat]]s were not vulnerable to the [[diurnality|diurnal]] mongoose). In other cases, such as [[oil palm]]s in Indonesia and Malaysia, the introduction produces substantial economic benefits, but the benefits are accompanied by costly [[unintended consequences]].  . 

Finally, an introduced species may unintentionally injure a species that depends on the species it replaces. In [[Belgium]], [[Prunus spinosa]] from Eastern Europe leafs much sooner than its West European counterparts, disrupting the feeding habits of the [[Thecla betulae]] butterfly (which feeds on the leaves). Introducing new species often leaves endemic and other local species unable to compete with the exotic species and unable to survive. The exotic organisms may be [[predator]]s, [[parasite]]s, or may simply outcompete indigenous species for nutrients, water and light.  . 

At present, several countries have already imported so many exotic species, particularly agricultural and ornamental plants, that their own indigenous fauna/flora may be outnumbered.  .

Hybridization and introgression are side-effects of introduction and invasion. These phenomena can be especially detrimental to [[rare species]] that come into contact with more abundant ones. The abundant species can interbreed with the rare species, swamping its [[gene pool]]. This problem is not always apparent from [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] (outward appearance) observations alone. Some degree of [[gene flow]] is normal adaptation, and not all [[gene]] and [[genotype]] constellations can be preserved. However, hybridization with or without introgression may, nevertheless, threaten a rare species' existence. <ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.27.1.83 | title = Extinction by Hybridization and Introgression | year = 1996 | last1 = Rhymer | first1 = Judith M. | last2 = Simberloff | first2 = Daniel | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 27 | pages = 83–109 | jstor = 2097230 }}</ref><ref>

===Overexploitation===. 
{{Main|Overexploitation}} . 

Overexploitation occurs when a resource is consumed at an unsustainable rate. This occurs on land in the form of [[overhunting]], excessive [[logging]], poor [[soil conservation]] in agriculture and the illegal [[wildlife trade]]. Joe Walston, director of the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Asian programs, called the latter the "single largest threat" to biodiversity in Asia. <ref>"[http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/03/vietnam-raids-restaurants-selling-illegal-exotic-meats/VietnamRaids Restaurants Selling Exotic Meats]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}" ''[[The New York Times]]''.

===Hybridization, genetic pollution/erosion and food security===. 
[[Image:Wheat selection k10183-1.jpg|right|thumb|The Yecoro [[wheat]] (right) [[cultivar]] is sensitive to salinity, plants resulting from a hybrid cross with cultivar W4910 (left) show greater tolerance to high salinity]]
{{See also|Food Security|Genetic erosion}} . 

In [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]], the [[Green Revolution]] popularized the use of conventional [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ization to increase yield. Often hybridized breeds originated in developed countries and were further hybridized with local varieties in the developing world to create high yield strains resistant to local climate and diseases. Local governments and industry have been pushing hybridization. Formerly huge gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds have collapsed causing widespread [[genetic erosion]] and genetic pollution. This has resulted in loss of [[genetic diversity]] and biodiversity as a whole. <ref name="bulletin28">[http://www.farmedia.org/bulletins/bulletin28.html "Genetic Pollution: The Great Genetic Scandal"; ]</ref> . 

[[Genetically modified organism|(GM organisms)]] have genetic material altered by [[genetic engineering]] procedures such as [[recombinant DNA technology]]. GM crops have become a common source for genetic pollution, not only of wild varieties but also of domesticated varieties derived from classical hybridization. <ref>{{Cite news|last=Pollan |first=Michael |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E6DE143CF93AA35751C1A9679C8B63 |title=The year in ideas: A TO Z.; Genetic Pollution; By Michael Pollan, The New York Times, December 9, 2001 |publisher=New York Times |date=2001-12-09 |accessdate=2009-06-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v22/n1/full/nbt0104-29.html |title=Dangerous Liaisons?

Genetic erosion coupled with genetic pollution may be destroying unique genotypes, thereby creating a hidden crisis which could result in a severe threat to our [[food security]]. Diverse genetic material could cease to exist which would impact our ability to further hybridize food crops and livestock against more resistant diseases and climatic changes. <ref name="bulletin28" /><!--this argument seems circular. hybridization is bad because...it limits future hybridization. so...the more genetic engineering the better so as to limit future hybridization? just sayin'...--> .

In 2004, an international collaborative study on four continents estimated that 10 percent of species would become extinct by 2050 because of [[global warming]]. "We need to limit climate change or we wind up with a lot of species in trouble, possibly extinct," said Dr. Lee Hannah, a co-author of the paper and chief climate change biologist at the Center for Applied Biodiversity Science at Conservation International. <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2004/jan/08/biodiversity.sciencenews|title=  An unnatural disaster|date= 2004-01-08|accessdate=2009-06-21 | location=London | first=Paul |last=Brown | work=The Guardian}}</ref> .

==Protection and restoration techniques==. 
Exotic species removal allows less competitive species to recover their ecological niches. Exotic species that have become a pest can be identified taxonomically (e.g. with [[Digital Automated Identification SYstem]] (DAISY), using the [[Consortium for the Barcode of Life|barcode of life]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barcoding.si.edu/ |title=Barcode of Life |publisher=Barcoding.si.edu |date=2010-05-26 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref><ref>[http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/303405,camel-cull-would-help-curb-global-warming.html Eradication of exotic animals (camels) in Australia]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref> Removal is practical only given large groups of individuals due to the economic cost.  . 

Once the preservation of the remaining native species in an area is assured. "missing" species can be identified and reintroduced using databases such as the ''[[Encyclopedia of Life#Resources and collaborations|Encyclopedia of Life]]'' and the [[Global Biodiversity Information Facility]].  . 

*[[Biodiversity banking]] places a monetary value on biodiversity. One example is the Australian [[Native Vegetation Management Framework]]. 
*[[Gene bank]]s are collections of specimens and genetic material. Some banks intend to reintroduce banked species to the ecosystem (e.g. via tree nurseries). <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbvl.be/Archief/guid/vlaanderen-heeft-45-zaadtuinen-voor-autochtone-bomen-en-struiken.aspx?artikel=0935212d-8b19-45a4-9cda-167ff68d347c |title=Belgium creating 45 "seed gardens"; gene banks with intent to reintroduction |publisher=Hbvl.be |date=2011-09-08 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref>
*Reducing and better targeting of pesticides allows more species to survive in agricultural and urbanized areas. 
*Location-specific approaches are less useful for protecting migratory species. One approach is to create [[wildlife corridor]]s that correspond to the animals' movements. National and other boundaries can complicate corridor creation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} . 

===Resource allocation===. 
Focusing on limited areas of higher potential biodiversity promises greater immediate return on investment than spreading resources evenly or focusing on areas of little diversity but greater interest in biodiversity.  . 

A second strategy focuses on areas that retain most of their original diversity, which typically require little or no restoration. These are typically non-urbanized, non-agricultural areas. Tropical areas often fit both criteria, given their natively high diversity and relative lack of development. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B7GJ6-4WSWYJV-1&_user=10&_coverDate=12%2F31%2F2009&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=gateway&_origin=gateway&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=cbb65f7275ea31c73b8e6e7f50e19e49&searchtype=a |title=Economics of biodiversity |publisher=Sciencedirect.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref> . 

==Legal status==. 
[[File:Hopetoun falls.jpg|thumb|right|A great deal of work is occurring to preserve the natural characteristics of [[Hopetoun Falls]], [[Australia]] while continuing to allow visitor access.]] . 

Biodiversity is taken into account in some political and judicial decisions:
* The relationship between law and ecosystems is very ancient and has consequences for biodiversity. It is related  to private and public property rights. It can define protection for  threatened ecosystems, but also some rights and duties (for example, [[fishing]] and hunting rights).{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}
* Law regarding species is more recent. It defines species that must be protected because they may be threatened by extinction.  The U.S. [[Endangered Species Act]] is an example of an attempt to address the "law and species" issue. 
* Laws regarding gene pools are only about a  century old.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Domestication and plant breeding methods are not new, but advances in [[genetic engineering]] has led to tighter laws covering distribution of [[genetically modified organisms]], gene [[patent]]s and process patents. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/patents.shtml |title=Gene Patenting |publisher=Ornl.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21}}</ref>  Governments struggle to decide whether to focus on for example, genes, genomes, or organisms and species.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} . 

Global agreements such as the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], give "sovereign national rights over biological resources" (not property). The agreements commit countries to "conserve biodiversity", "develop resources for sustainability" and "share the benefits" resulting from their use. Biodiverse countries that allow [[bioprospecting]] or collection of natural products, expect a share of the benefits rather than allowing the individual or institution that discovers/exploits the resource to capture them privately.  Bioprospecting can become a type of [[biopiracy]] when such principles are not respected.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} . 

Sovereignty principles can rely upon what is better known as [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture|Access and Benefit Sharing Agreements]] (ABAs). The Convention on Biodiversity implies [[informed consent]] between the source country and the collector, to establish which resource will be used and for what, and to settle on a [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture|fair agreement on benefit sharing]].  . 

Uniform approval for use of biodiversity as a legal standard has not been achieved, however. Bosselman argues that biodiversity should not be used as a legal standard, claiming that the remaining areas of scientific uncertainty cause unacceptable administrative waste and increase litigation without promoting preservation goals. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.law.nyu.edu/journals/envtllaw/issues/vol12/bosselman-for%20web.pdf |title=Fred Bosselman, A Dozen Biodiversity Puzzles, 12 N.Y.U.
