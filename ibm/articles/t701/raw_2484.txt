{{Wildlife of Australia}}
'''Conservation in Australia''' is an issue of state and federal policy. [[Australia]] is one of the most biologically diverse countries in the world{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}, with a large portion of  species [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to Australia. Preserving this wealth of [[biodiversity]] is important for future generations.  . 

[[Animal]] [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]s like [[reef]]s and [[forest]]s must be preserved in order to preserve population and diversity of animal species. Conservation is vital for future study and for field [[research]] to be undertaken, and because biological richness is an unmeasurable aesthetic that may be developed into commercial [[recreation]]al attractions.  . 

According to [[Janine Benyus]], the potential for advances in [[biomimicry]] in Australia are great because the [[extreme weather]] and conditions found here provide an excellent [[evolution]]ary incubator. Research on natural processes can only occur if habitat is preserved and [[organism]]s continue to thrive.

Federal and State governments manage [[protected areas]] and [[national parks]]; a number of non-governmental organizations are also involved in conservation.  .

A key conservation issue is the preservation of biodiversity, especially by protecting the remaining [[rainforest]]s. The destruction of habitat by human activities, including land clearing, remains the major cause of biodiversity loss in Australia. The importance of the Australian rainforests to the conservation movement is very high. Australia is the only [[Western World|western]] country to have large areas of rainforest intact. <ref>Our Rainforests and the issues'' by Beryl Morris, Tondy Sadler and Graham N. Harrington. 1992. [[CSIRO]]. ISBN 0-643-05141-4</ref> Forests provide [[timber]], [[drug]]s, and [[food]] and should be managed to maximize the possible uses. Currently, there are a number of environmental movements and campaigners advocating for action on saving the environment, one such campaign is the Big Switch. <ref>[http://www.thebigswitch.org.au/ The Big Switch]</ref> . 

[[Land management]] issues including clearance of native vegetation, reafforestation of once-cleared areas, [[Invasive species, Australia|control of exotic weeds and pests]], expansion of dryland [[salinity]], and changed [[fire]] regimes. Intensification of resource use in sectors such as [[forestry]], [[fishery|fisheries]], and [[Agriculture in Australia|agriculture]] are widely reported to contribute to biodiversity loss in Australia. Coastal and [[ocean|marine]] environments also have reduced biodiversity from reduced water quality caused by [[pollution]] and sediments arising from human settlements and agriculture. In central [[New South Wales]] where there are large plains of grassland, problems have risen from—unusual to say—lack of land clearing.  . 

Before European settlement, [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]] burnt the grassland regularly for thousands of years and eventually native animals became dependent on the grasslands and the regular burning. When [[European ethnic groups|European]]s settled the area in the early 19th century, their ignorance lead to the destruction of the grassland through lack of regular burning.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Thus the grasslands were swallowed up by woody weeds and shrub, degrading the soil, accelerating erosion and reducing the biodiversity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} .

==Protected areas==. 
{{Main|Protected areas of Australia}}
There are numerous [[protected areas]] in all States and Territories that have been created to protect and preserve Australia's unique ecosystems. Protected areas include national parks and other reserves, as well as 64 wetlands which are registered under the [[Ramsar Convention]] and 16 [[World Heritage Site]]s. {{As of|2002}}, 10.8% (774,619.51&nbsp;km²) of the total land area of Australia is within a protected area. <ref name="capas2002">Department of the Environment and Heritage. 2002.
