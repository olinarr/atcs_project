There have been a number of [[economic]] arguments advanced regarding evaluation of the benefits of [[biodiversity]]. Most are [[Anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] but economists have also debated whether biodiversity is inherently valuable, independent of benefits to human.  . 

Diverse [[ecosystem]]s are typically more productive than non-diverse ones, because any set of [[species]] can never fully exploit all potential [[ecological niche|niche]]s. Since human economic productivity is largely reliant on Earth's ecosystems, adequate bioproductivity needs to be maintained.  . 

The wealth of natural innovation found in biological organisms rivals all known technologies derived through synthetic means.  A single [[human genome]] has some three billion [[bit]]s of information but the human species also has many variations.  There are many millions of species of life on the planet each with valuable information. Many chemical formulae and forty-five percent of all drugs have bio-origin {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. In the long run keeping genetic records of all species could, however, be just as useful in this regard.  . 

Some of the important economic commodities that biodiversity supplies to [[humankind]] are: . 

==Food==. 
{{Main|Biodiversity and food}}
Biodiversity provides high variety of food: [[Crop (agriculture)|crops]], [[livestock]], [[forestry]], and [[fish]] are important food source of human species. 
However, the number of species have been domesticated and cultivated are small if comparing with the number of species existing. 
Wild species and varieties can supply genes for improving domesticated species by improving their yield, disease resistance, tolerance and vigor; this can increase the profit of farming.  . 

===Biological pest control===. 
[[Image:Ladybird aphid 7462.jpg|right|thumb|A [[ladybird]] larva eating [[aphid]]s]]
{{Main|Biological pest control}}
Using control species is often considered as more enivronmentally friendly method with compared with using [[pesticide]]s. The control species can be used to protect the crops against [[Pest (organism)|pest]]s and [[weed]]s. The economic loss due to the loss of crops/food can be reduced with the use of the control species.  . 

Also, the population of disease vectors (for example, [[mosquito]]es) and the invasive species can be controlled; thus, the economic loss led by the invasive species and vectors can be reduced.  . 

However, even with extensive research into the control species, their use is a risky business, as in the importation of the [[Cane Toad]] to control beetles in Queensland.  . 

==Medication==. 
{{Main|Biodiversity and drugs}}
A wide variety of plants, animals and fungi are used as medicine. Wild plant species have been used for medicinal purposes since before the beginning of recorded history. Over 60% of world population depends on the plant medicines for their primary health care. <ref name="Gaston and Spicer">Kevin J. Gaston & John I. Spicer. 2004. Biodiversity: an introduction, [[Blackwell Publishing]]. 2nd Ed. ISBN 1-4051-1857-1</ref> For example, [[quinine]] comes from the [[cinchona]] tree has been used to treat [[malaria]], [[digitalis]] from the [[foxglove]] plant treats chronic heart trouble, and [[morphine]] from the [[poppy]] plant gives pain relief.  . 

According to the [[National Cancer Institute]], over 70 % of the promising anti-cancer drugs come from plants in the [[tropical rainforest]]s. It is estimated that of the 250,000 known plant species, only 5,000 have been researched for possible medical applications.  [[Ethnopharmacy]] is the branch of science that investigates [[traditional medicine]]s.  . 

Animals may also play a role, in particular in research. In traditional remedies, animals are extenively used as drugs. Many animals also medicate ''themselves''. [[Zoopharmacognosy]] is the study of how animals use plants, insects and other inorganic materials in self-medicatation. In an interview with the late [[Neil Campbell (scientist)|Neil Campbell]],  [[Eloy Rodriguez]] describes the importance of biodiversity: . 

"Some of the compounds we've identified by zoopharmacognosy kill parasitic worms, and some of these chemicals may be useful against tumors. There is no question that the templates for most drugs are in the natural world." <ref>Campbell, N. A. (1996) ''Biology'' (4th edition). [[Benjamin Cummings]] NY. p.23 ISBN 0-8053-1957-3</ref> . 

==Industry==. 
For example, [[fiber]]s for [[cloth]]ing, [[wood]] for shelter and warmth. Biodiversity may be a source of [[energy]] (such as [[biomass]]). Other industrial products are [[Vegetable oil|oil]]s, [[lubricant]]s, [[perfume]]s, [[fragrance]]s, [[dye]]s, [[paper]], [[wax]]es, [[rubber]], [[latex]]es, [[resin]]s, [[poison]]s, and [[cork (material)|cork]], which can all be derived from various plant species. Supplies from animal origin include [[wool]], [[silk]], [[fur]], [[leather]], [[lubricant]]s, and waxes.  . 

Animals may also be used as a mode of [[transport]].  . 

Biological material can provide models for many industrial materials and structures. For example, the inspiration for the infrared sensor came from the thermosensitive pit organ of [[rattlesnake]]. The modelling is considered as [[Biomimicry]].  . 

==Recreational harvesting==. 
Various animals are harvested for display and as [[pet]]; many species of plants are harvested for personal and private gardening.  . 

In Britain alone, some 65,000 species are sold for horticulture{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.  It has been suggested that this form of [[ex-situ conservation]] may be the most practical form in the future.  . 

==Tourism and recreation== . 

{{Main|Ecotourism}} . 

Biodiversity is a source of economic wealth for many regions of the world, such as many [[nature reserve]]s, [[park]]s and [[forest]]s, where wildlife and plants are sources of beauty and joy for many people. [[Ecotourism]], in particular, is a growing outdoor recreational activity. In 1988, it is estimated that 157-236 million people took part in ecotourism. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  The majority of species have yet to be evaluated for their current or future economic importance.  .
