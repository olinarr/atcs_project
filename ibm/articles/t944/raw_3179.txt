'''Draft-card burning''' was a symbol of protest performed by thousands of young American men as part of the [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|opposition to the involvement of the United States in the Vietnam War]]. Beginning in May 1964,<ref>{{cite book |last=Flynn |first=George Q. |title=The Draft, 1940–1973 |publisher=University Press of Kansas |year=1993 |series=Modern war studies |isbn=070060586X |page=175}}</ref><ref name="Gershon 1991 xix">{{cite book |last=Gottlieb |first=Sherry Gershon |title=Hell no, we won't go!: resisting the draft during the Vietnam War |publisher=Viking |year=1991 |page=xix |quote=1964: May 12—Twelve students at a New York rally burn their draft cards... |isbn=0670839353}}</ref> some activists burned their draft cards at anti-war rallies and demonstrations. By May 1965 it was happening with greater frequency. To limit this kind of protest,<ref name=Foerster1997/> in August 1965, the [[United States Congress]] enacted a law to broaden draft card violations to punish anyone who "knowingly destroys, knowingly mutilates" his draft card. <ref name=Miller>{{cite journal |url=http://www.reclaimingquarterly.org/82/rq-82-draftcard.html |last=Miller |first=David |authorlink=David J.

"Of the more than twenty-five thousand men who destroyed their draft cards, most of them publicly, only forty-six were indicted..."</ref> for burning their draft cards at various rallies, and four major court cases were heard. One of them, ''[[United States v. O'Brien]]'', was argued before the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]]. The act of draft card burning was defended as a symbolic form of [[free speech]], a constitutional right guaranteed by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. The Supreme Court decided against the draft card burners; it determined that the federal law was justified and that it was unrelated to the freedom of speech. This outcome was criticized by legal experts.  . 

In Australia following the 1966 troop increases directed by [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Harold Holt]], conscription notices were burned at mass demonstrations against Australian involvement in Vietnam. In June 1968, the government reacted by strengthening penalties for infractions of the [[National Service Act 1964|1964 National Service Act]], including the burning of registration cards. War protest ceased in 1972 when Australia's new [[Australian Labor Party|Labor government]] withdrew troops from Vietnam and abolished [[Conscription in Australia|conscription]].  . 

From 1965 to 1973, very few men in the U.S. were convicted of burning their draft cards. Some 25,000 others went unpunished. <ref name="Gershon 1991 173"/> Before 1965, the act of burning a draft card was already prohibited by U.S. statute—the registrant was required to carry the card at all times, and any destruction of it was thus against the law. Also, it was entirely possible for a young man to destroy his draft card and still answer his country's call to service by appearing at an induction center and serving in the military. <ref name=Bailey2009/> And it was possible for a registrant to faithfully keep his card on his person but fail to appear when called. The draft card was not an essential part of the government's ability to draft men into the military. Thus draft-card burning was an act of [[war resistance]] more than it was [[draft resistance]]. <ref name=Miller/><ref>{{cite book |last=Haiman |first=Franklyn Saul |title="Speech acts" and the First Amendment |pages=[http://books.google.com/books?id=pMN0eeOQkocC&pg=PA70 70–72, 174–182] |publisher=SIU Press |year=2007 |isbn=0809318822}}</ref> . 

The image of draft card burning was a powerful one, influential in American politics and culture. <ref name=Bailey2009/> It appeared in magazines, newspapers and on television, signaling a political divide between those who backed the U.S. government and its military goals and those who were against any U.S. involvement in Vietnam. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Amey |first1=L.J. |last2=Rasmussen |first2=R.

[[File:DraftcardRenJuan.jpg|thumb|upright|A Vietnam-era draft card worn out from years in a wallet]]
From 1948, under the [[Selective Service Act of 1948|Selective Service Act]], all American men between the ages of 18 and 35 were required to register with a local draft board. In case of war, the able-bodied ones among them could be drafted to serve in the military. The law required the men to carry their draft cards with them at all times. These were small white cards bearing the registrant's identifying information, the date and place of registration, and a unique Selective Service number.  . 

In an amendment sponsored by Congressmen [[L. Mendel Rivers]] and [[William G. Bray]], on August 31, 1965, the law was augmented with four words, to include penalties for any person who "knowingly destroys, knowingly mutilates" the card, under 50 [[United States Code|U.S.C.]] § 462(b)(3). <ref name=OBrien/> [[Strom Thurmond]] moved the bill through the Senate, calling draft-card burning "contumacious conduct" which "represents a potential threat to the exercise of the power to raise and support armies."<ref name=Bailey2009/> At the time, many observers (including the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]]) believed that Congress had intentionally targeted anti-war draft-card burners. <ref name="target">On the intent behind the amendment, the Court of Appeals wrote, "We would be closing our eyes in the light of the prior law if we did not see on the face of the amendment that it was precisely directed at public as distinguished from private destruction. In other words, a special offense was committed by persons such as the defendant who made a spectacle of their disobedience."  ''O'Brien v.

Following the 1964 National Service Act, legislated in response to the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation]], 20-year-old Australian men were subject to military service based on a birthday lottery. In April 1965, Prime Minister Sir [[Robert Menzies]] sent a battalion of Army regulars to Vietnam, beginning an overseas involvement in that country which lasted for seven years and provoked deeply divisive debate back home. <ref>{{cite book |last=Edwards |first=P.

On October 15, 1965, [[David J. Miller]] burned his draft card at a rally held near the Armed Forces Induction Center on [[Whitehall Street]] in Manhattan. He spoke briefly to the crowd from atop a sound truck and then tried but failed to burn his card with matches—the wind kept blowing them out. A [[lighter]] was offered by the crowd and it worked. Miller was arrested by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigations|FBI]] three days later in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]] while setting up peace literature on a table. <ref name=Miller/> The 24-year-old pacifist, member of the [[Catholic Worker Movement]], became the first man convicted under the 1965 amendment. <ref name=Nixonland>{{cite book |last=Perlstein |first=Rick |authorlink=Rick Perlstein |title=[[Nixonland: The Rise of a President and the Fracturing of America]] |year=2008 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |page=[http://books.google.com/books?id=dM_enWzoghoC&pg=PA180 180] |isbn=9780743243025}}</ref> In April 1966 with his wife and breast-feeding baby in attendance, he was sentenced to 30 months in prison. <ref name=Nixonland/><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.vietnam.ttu.edu/star/images/1451/14511002032.pdf |title=The Court Reporter |journal=News Notes |publisher=[[Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors]] |month=May–June |year=1967 |volume=19 |number=3 |accessdate=March 15, 2011}}</ref> The case was argued in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] in June.

He said, "I do not feel that five years of my life are too much to give to say that this law is wrong."<ref name=Bailey2009/> He had previously alerted newspaper reporters and two television stations, and they were present to record his act.

===''United States v. O'Brien''===. 
{{main|United States v. O'Brien}}
On the morning of March 31, 1966, David Paul O'Brien and three companions burned their draft cards on the steps of the [[South Boston, Massachusetts|South Boston]] Courthouse, in front of a crowd that included several FBI agents. After the four men came under attack from some of the crowd, an FBI agent ushered O'Brien inside the courthouse and advised him of his rights. O'Brien made a [[Confession (law)|confession]] and produced the charred remains of the certificate. He was then indicted for violating § 462(b)(3) and put on trial in the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts]]. <ref name=OBrien>The facts of O'Brien's protest, arrest, and trial are summarized in the Supreme Court's opinion, [http://supreme.justia.com/us/391/367/case.html ''United States v. O'Brien'', 391 U.S. 367, 369-70 (1968)]. </ref> . 

O'Brien argued that the four words added to the draft card law were unconstitutional, that they were an abridgment of the freedom of speech. He argued that the amendment served no valid purpose because the Selective Service Act already required draft registrants to carry their card on their persons at all times, thus any form of destruction was already a violation. <ref name=OBrien/> He explained that he burned the draft card publicly as a form of symbolic speech to persuade others to oppose the war, "so that other people would reevaluate their positions with Selective Service, with the armed forces, and reevaluate their place in the culture of today, to hopefully consider my position."<ref name=OBrien/> On January 24, 1968, the Supreme Court determined that the 1965 amendment was constitutional as enacted and as applied, and that it did not distinguish between public or private destruction or mutilation of the draft card. <ref name=Pacifica/> They determined that there was nothing necessarily expressive in the burning of a draft card. [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Earl Warren]] said, "we cannot accept the view that an apparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled 'speech' whenever the person engaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea."<ref name=Blanchard1992/> O'Brien's previous sentence of six years was upheld. <ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=f7m713xwK58C&pg=PA207 |pages=207–208 |title=Encyclopedia of the United States Constitution |volume=1 |last=Schultz |first=David Andrew |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2009 |isbn=0816067635 |series=Facts on File library of American history}}</ref> . 

The Supreme Court's conclusion was criticized by legal observers such as [[Dean Alfange Jr]] for its "astonishingly cavalier" treatment. <ref>{{cite journal |last=Alfange |first=Dean Jr |authorlink=Dean Alfange Jr |title=Free Speech and Symbolic Conduct: The Draft-Card Burning Case |journal=The Supreme Court Review |volume=1968 |year=1968 |pages=1–52 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |jstor=3108767}}</ref> Many saw in O'Brien's act a clear communicative element with the "intent to convey a particularized message", an intent to which the court did not give much weight. <ref name=Werhan2004>{{cite book |last=Werhan |first=Keith |title=Freedom of speech: a reference guide to the United States Constitution |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2004 |pages=125–127 |isbn=0313319979 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DD7_JoZfWisC&pg=PA125}}</ref> Instead, the court weighed as greater the government's interest "in assuring the continued availability of issued Selective Service certificates."<ref name=Werhan2004/> . 

In 1975, legal scholar [[John Hart Ely]] found fault with ''O'Brien''. He pointed out that the draft-card-burning question was not decided in relation to the similar one surrounding the act of [[Flag desecration|flag burning]]; an issue which the court had avoided for years. <ref>{{cite journal |last=Ely |first=John Hart |authorlink=John Hart Ely |title=Flag Desecration: A Case Study in the Roles of Categorization and Balancing in First Amendment Analysis |journal=Harvard Law Review |volume=88 |number=7 |month=May |year=1975 |pages=1482–1508 |jstor=1340121}}</ref> Ely's analysis was aided by that of [[T. M. Scanlon|Thomas Scanlon]] in 1972, in ''A Theory of Freedom of Expression'', which interpreted the freedom of speech broadly, including such public and political acts as [[self-immolation]]. <ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pS3tro08BFcC&pg=PA231 |page=231 |last=Ely |first=John Hart |authorlink=John Hart Ely |title=Democracy and distrust: a theory of judicial review |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1980 |isbn=0674196376}}</ref> In 1990 ''O'Brien'' was analyzed again by critics following the case ''[[United States v. Eichman]]'' which determined that flag burning was a form of free speech, and some made comparisons to the earlier 1984 case ''Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence'' which determined that sleeping at a protest rally location in a downtown park was valid as a symbolic expression intended to bring attention to the plight of the homeless. These expansive interpretations of the freedom of speech appeared large enough to include draft-card burning. The position taken in ''O'Brien'' was that the individual's right to freedom of speech did not limit the government in prohibiting harmful conduct. <ref name=Werhan2004/> However, the harmful conduct of burning a draft card did not have the normal test applied: it was not determined to be a case of "clear and present danger". <ref name=Foerster1997>{{cite book |last=Foerster |first=Herbert N. |title=Free expression and censorship in America: an encyclopedia |pages=65–66 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_eFgZJCX8VUC&pg=PA65 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1997 |isbn=0313292310}}</ref> . 

In 1996, future Supreme Court Justice [[Elena Kagan]] pointed out that the ''O'Brien'' court did not appear to be concerned whether the law as enacted or enforced "matched, or even resembled" the asserted government interest of stopping draft resistance protests. <ref name=Kagan1996>{{cite journal |last=Kagan |first=Elena |authorlink=Elena Kagan |title=Private Speech, Public Purpose: The Role of Governmental Motive in First Amendment Doctrine |journal=[[University of Chicago Law Review]] |volume=63 |number=2 |month=Spring |year=1996 |pages=413–517 |url=http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Private-Speech-Public-Purpose.pdf}}</ref> Kagan noted that the law prohibiting the destruction of the draft card "interfered" with only one point of view: that of the anti-war protester. She allowed as how a successful challenge to ''O'Brien'' might come from focusing on such skewed constraints. <ref name=Kagan1996/> .

Jezer said the FBI arrested only Rader; other participants were merely visited by FBI agents. <ref name=Jezer/> Goodman's article exhorted his readers to massive direct action in draft resistance; in response, folk singer [[Robert Claiborne]] wrote to the ''Review'' to say that Goodman's plan would "check the growth of the peace movement and markedly reduce prospects for ending the war."<ref name=Claiborne>{{cite web |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1967/jun/29/we-wont-go-4/ |title=We Won't Go: Robert Claiborne, reply to Paul Goodman |last=Claiborne |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Claiborne |date=June 29, 1967 |publisher=[[The New York Review of Books]] |accessdate=March 12, 2011}}</ref> Claiborne asserted that the "great majority" of Americans were "[[Square (slang)|squares]]" over 30 and not in favor of war protest even though they were likely interested in "ending the slaughter of their sons and other people’s sons."<ref name=Claiborne/> . 

October 16, 1967, was a day of widespread war protest organized by The Mobe in 30 cities across the U.S., with some 1,400 draft cards burned. <ref name=Elmer2005>{{cite book |last=Elmer |first=Jerry |title=Felon for peace: the memoir of a Vietnam-era draft resister |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=07mMTohIEZYC&pg=PA61 |pages=61–62 |publisher=Vanderbilt University Press |year=2005 |isbn=0826514952}}</ref> At the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] [[Arlington Street Church]] in [[Boston]], draft registrants were given the opportunity to turn in their draft cards to be sent as a package to Selective Service as an act of [[civil disobedience]] against the war. Those offering their draft cards split into two groups: a group of 214 turned in their cards, and 67 chose to burn their cards. These 67 used an old candle from prominent Unitarian preacher [[William Ellery Channing]] to supply the flame. One woman, Nan Stone, burned a draft card belonging to Steve Paillet—the 1965 law allowed for anyone to be punished for draft-card burning, even someone who was not registered for the draft. Stone later typed up the information from the 214 turned-in cards to serve as a database of war resisters. She found that the average and mean age of the men was 22, and that three out of four came from [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Yale University|Yale]], or [[Boston University]]. <ref>{{cite book |last=Foley |first=Michael S. |title=Confronting the war machine: draft resistance during the Vietnam War |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NlzvUKVoSr4C&pg=PA119 |pages=119–122 |publisher=UNC Press |year=2003 |isbn=0807854360}}</ref> . 

At San Francisco's [[Phillip Burton Federal Building|Federal Building]] on December 4, 1967, some 500 protesters witnessed 88 draft cards collected and burned. <ref name=Pacifica/> . 

About 1,000 draft cards were turned in on April 3, 1968, in nationwide protests organized by The Mobe. In Boston, 15,000 protesters watched 235 men turn in their draft cards. War protesters were increasingly choosing the more profound act of turning in their draft cards, an act which gave the government the name and address of the protester. Burning the draft card destroyed the evidence, and by this time was seen as less courageous. <ref name=Elmer2005/> . 

==Public reaction==. 
Many in America were not happy with the draft-card burners, or with the frequent depiction of them in the media. Joseph Scerra, national commander of the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]], spoke against what he saw as too much news coverage: "All of our young people are not burning up their draft cards. All of our young people are not tearing up the flag. All of our youth are not supporting North Vietnam and carrying Viet Cong flags."<ref name=Foley2003>Foley, 2003, [http://books.google.com/books?id=NlzvUKVoSr4C&pg=PA118 p. 118]</ref> In October 1967 at a rally in support of the government a news photograph was snapped of a man kissing his draft card, his girlfriend smiling at his side. <ref name=Foley2003/> In ''[[Playboy]]''{{'}}s November 1967 issue, [[Playboy Playmate]] [[Kaya Christian]] wrote that her "turn-offs" were "hypocrites" and "draft card burners". <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.playboy.com/girls/playmates/directory/196711.html |title=Kaya Christian |work=The Girls: Playmate Directory |publisher=Playboy |accessdate=March 14, 2011}}</ref> . 

Leftist ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' magazine showed four draft cards being burned on the December 1967 cover. ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', a conservative publication, put an image of draft card burning on their cover, January 27, 1968. In 1967 [[off-Broadway]] and 1968 on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and in London's [[West End theatre|West End]], the musical [[Hair (musical)|''Hair'']] featured a climactic scene in Act I of a group of men in a hippie "tribe" burning their draft cards while the main character Claude struggles with the decision to join them.  . 

President Johnson spoke strongly against the draft-card protesters, saying in October 1967 that he wanted the "antidraft movement" investigated for Communist influences. <ref name=Bailey2009/> Reporting on his reaction, ''[[The New York Times]]'' presented the protests as being against the draft rather than the war. <ref name=Bailey2009/> Many commentators focused on draft resistance as an explanation rather than the more challenging war resistance: the main concern of the protesters. <ref name=Bailey2009/> In 1968 when Richard Nixon was running for election against Johnson, he determined that he could gain supporters on both sides of the war question by promising to abolish the draft, promising to make the military into a purely [[Volunteer military|volunteer force]]. In this he was following others who had suggested such a strategy, including [[Donald Rumsfeld]] of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Wednesday Group]] the year before. <ref name=Bailey2009/> After gaining the presidency—twice—Nixon finally stopped the draft after February 1973. The last man to be drafted entered the U.S. Army on June 30, 1973. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.selectiveservice.us/military-draft/8-induction.shtml |title=Induction Statistics |publisher=Selective Service |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref> .
