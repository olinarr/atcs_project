'''''United States v. Eichman''''', [[Case citation|496 U.S. 310]] (1990) was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case that invalidated a federal law against [[flag desecration]] as violative of [[free speech]] under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. It was argued together with the case ''[[United States v. Haggerty]]''.  It built on the opinion handed down in the Court's 1989 decision in ''[[Texas v. Johnson]]'', which invalidated on First Amendment grounds a Texas state statute banning flag-burning. 
__TOC__ . 

==Subsequent actions==. 
On remand, the Eichman case was dismissed, as those defendants had only been charged with flag desecration. However, the Haggerty case had an additional charge of destruction of government property, as the burned flag was alleged to have been stolen from Seattle's Capitol Hill Post Office. To that charge, all four Seattle defendants pled guilty and were fined. Garza and Strong (who had prior convictions) served 3 days in jail each.  . 

When Republicans retook control of Congress for the [[104th United States Congress|104th session]], the [[Flag Desecration Amendment]] was first proposed, which would grant the federal government the authority to proscribe flag burning. A resolution for this Amendment passed the House in every session from the 104th until the 109th Congress, but never got past the Senate (in the most recent vote, passage in the Senate failed by one vote), and has not been considered since the 109th Congress.  .
