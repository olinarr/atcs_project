'''Support for the legalization of abortion''' is centered on the '''pro-choice movement''' (also known as the '''abortion-rights movement'''), a [[sociopolitical]] movement supporting the [[ethics|ethical]] view that a woman should have the legal right to elective [[abortion]], meaning the right to terminate her [[pregnancy]].  . 

A key point in the development of the movement was the decriminalization and legalization of elective abortion in various [[U.S. state|states]] following the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]'s 1973 decision in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', which struck down most state laws restricting abortion. <ref name=Staggenborg>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3oRBOuEvz30C&pg=PA188 |page=188 |title=The Pro-Choice Movement: Organization and Activism in the Abortion Conflict |first=Suzanne |last=Staggenborg |publisher=Oxford University Press US |year=1994 |isbn=0-19-508925-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.brennancenter.org/blog/archives/Greenhouse_and_Reva_B._Siegel |page= |title=Before Roe v. Wade: Voices that Shaped the Abortion Debate Before the Supreme Court's Ruling |first=Linda|last=Greenhouse |publisher=Kaplan Publishing |year=2010 |isbn=1-60714-671-1}}</ref> . 

The same decision gave rise to an opposing countermovement of [[opposition to the legalization of abortion|pro-life campaigners]] (also called anti-abortion campaigners) who generally argue for the rights of fetuses and for prohibition or restriction of abortion. Subscribing to different moral grounds than the pro-choice movement, pro-lifers hold the view that the human [[fetus]] (and in most cases the human [[embryo]]) is a [[person]] and therefore has a right to life.  . 

== Overview ==. 
{{See also|Ethical aspects of abortion}}
Abortion-rights advocates argue that whether or not to continue with a pregnancy is an inviolable personal choice, as it involves a woman's body, personal health, and future. They believe that both parents' and children's lives are better when abortions are legal, thus preventing women from going to desperate lengths to obtain illegal abortions. More broadly, abortion-rights advocates frame their beliefs in terms of individual liberty, reproductive freedom, and reproductive rights. The first of these terms was widely used to describe many of the political movements of the 19th and 20th centuries (such as in the abolition of slavery in [[Europe]] and the United States, and in the spread of popular democracy) whereas the latter terms derive from changing perspectives on sexual freedom and bodily integrity.  . 

Abortion-rights individuals rarely consider themselves "pro-abortion," because they consider abortion an issue of bodily autonomy, and find forced abortion to be as legally and morally indefensible as the outlawing of abortion. Indeed, some who support abortion rights consider themselves opposed to some or all abortions on a moral basis, but believe that abortions would happen in any case and that legal abortion under medically controlled conditions is preferable to illegal [[back-alley abortion]] without proper medical supervision. Such people believe the death rate of women due to such procedures in areas where abortions are only available outside of the medical establishment is unacceptable.  . 

Some who argue from a philosophical viewpoint believe that an embryo has no rights as it is only a potential and not an actual person and that it should not have rights that override those of the pregnant woman until it is viable. <ref>{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=i_tbPhm1JZUC |title=Bioethics: a nursing perspective |year=2004 |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |last=Johnstone |first=Megan-Jane |isbn=978-0-7295-3726-1}}</ref> . 

Many abortion-rights campaigners also say that anti-abortion activists oppose sex education and contraception, thus increasing the demand for abortion, and that abortion-rights activists, in contrast, support policies that decrease this demand. <ref>{{Cite news |last=Cosgrove |first=Terry |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terry-cosgrove/socalled-prolifers-shou_b_69729.html |title=So-Called Pro-Lifers Should Stop Promoting Abortion |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=October 24, 2007 |accessdate=2010-12-27}}</ref>{{primary source-inline|date=September 2011}} Proponents of this argument point to cases of areas with limited sex education and contraceptive access that have high abortion rates, either legal, illegal or [[de facto]] exported (i.e., where a high proportion of abortions from a state occur outside that state in another country with a more liberal abortion regime). [[Ireland|Irish]] women who visit the [[United Kingdom]] for abortions are one example, as were the [[Belgium|Belgian]] women who travelled to [[France]] (before Belgium legalized abortion).  . 

Some people who support abortion rights see abortion as a last resort and focus on a number of situations where they feel abortion is a necessary option. Among these situations are those where the woman was raped, her health or life (or that of the fetus) is at risk, [[contraception]] was used but failed, the fetus has acute [[congenital disorder]] and defects, incest, financial constraints, [[one-child policy]]/[[overpopulation]], or she feels unable to raise a child. Some abortion-rights moderates, who would otherwise be willing to accept certain restrictions on abortion, feel that political pragmatism compels them to oppose any such restrictions, as they could be used to form a [[slippery slope]] against all abortions. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/blogs/themix/27706/|title=Husband notification laws and Alito|accessdate=2006-07-07|last=Zandt|first=Deanna|date=2005-11-03|publisher=AlterNet}}</ref>{{primary source-inline|date=September 2011}} .

{{AbortionLawsMap|size=350px}} . 

The issue of abortion remains one of the most divisive in public life, with continuing battles to liberalise or restrict access to legal abortion. Abortion-rights groups are active in all states in the USA, campaigning for legal abortion with varying degrees of success. Few of these states allow abortion without limitation or regulation, but most do allow various limited forms of abortion. Abortion-rights campaigners themselves are frequently divided as to the types of abortion that should be available and to what extent access is to be restricted.  . 

===Africa===. 
[[Abortion in South Africa|South Africa]] allows abortion on demand under its [[Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act]].  Most African nations, however, have abortion bans except in cases where the woman's life or health is at risk.  A number of abortion-rights international organizations have made altering abortion laws and expanding [[family planning]] services in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and the [[developing world]] a top priority.  . 

===Europe===. 
Most European countries have legalized abortion (in at least some cases) through certain laws (United Kingdom, France, [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Netherlands]], etc.). [[Russia]] legalized the procedure in 1955. It is also the country with the lowest level of sexual education. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3093152.stm|title=Russia turns spotlight on abortion|accessdate=2006-07-07|last=Greenall|first=Robert|date=2003-09-16|work=BBC News Online|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>{{vague|date=January 2012}} . 

====United Kingdom====. 
{{main|Abortion in the UK}}
In the United Kingdom, the [[Abortion Act 1967]] legalized abortion, except in [[Northern Ireland]]. In Great Britain, the law states that pregnancy may be terminated up to 24 weeks<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7412118.stm | work=BBC News | title=MPs reject cut in abortion limit | date=2008-05-21 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref> if it: .

However, the criteria of risk to mental and physical health is applied liberally, and ''de facto'' makes abortion available on demand,<ref>[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/297.html R v British Broadcasting Corporation, ex parte ProLife Alliance] [2002] EWCA Civ 297 at [6], [2002] 2 All ER 756 at 761, CA</ref> though this still requires the consent of two [[National Health Service]] doctors. Abortions in Great Britain are provided for free by the NHS.  . 

The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] are predominantly pro-abortion-rights parties, though with significant minorities in each either holding extremely restrictive definitions of the right to choose, or subscribing to an anti-abortion analysis. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] is more evenly split between both camps and its leader, [[David Cameron]], supports abortion on demand in the early stages of pregnancy. <ref>[http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/20th-june-2008/3/david-cameron-supports-abortion-on-demand David Cameron supports abortion on demand], [[Catholic Herald]], 20 June 2008. </ref> . 

====Ireland====. 
{{main|Abortion in the Republic of Ireland}}
Abortion is illegal in the [[Republic of Ireland]] except when the woman's life is threatened by a medical condition or a suicide risk, since [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|a 1983 referendum]] amended the [[Constitution of Ireland|constitution]]. Subsequent [[Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland|amendments]] – the [[Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|thirteenth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|fourteenth]] – guaranteed the right to travel abroad (for abortions) and to distribute and obtain information of "services" not available in the country, such as abortion, which are lawful in other countries. A proposal to remove suicide risk as a ground for abortion was [[Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland Bill, 2002|struck down in a 2002 referendum]]. Thousands of women get around the ban by privately traveling to the other European countries (typically Britain and the Netherlands) to undergo terminations. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6639673.stm BBC News – Irish teen wins abortion battle]</ref> . 

The [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]], [[Sinn Féin]], [[Communist Party of Ireland|Communist Party]] and [[Socialist Party (Ireland)|Socialist Party]] are in favor of liberalizing the laws. For many other parties (such as the [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]]), it is a 'matter of conscience' and they have no official line on the issue. <ref>[http://www.choiceireland.org/node/60 Choice Ireland – ''Irish political parties: Where do they stand?'']</ref> . 

Abortion is also illegal in Northern Ireland, except in cases when the woman is threatened by a medical condition, physical or mental. <ref>''Rex v Bourne'' [1939] 1 KB 687, [1938] 3 All ER 615, [[Court of Criminal Appeal|CCA]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Q&A: Abortion in Northern Ireland|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/1386450.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=December 9, 2011|date=June 13, 2001}}</ref> . 

====Poland====. 
{{main|Abortion in Poland}}
Abortion is illegal in [[Poland]] unless the pregnancy endangers the life of the mother, the pregnancy was the result of a criminal act or the fetus is seriously malformed. <ref>{{cite web|title=Rozporządzenie Prezydenta Rzeczypospolitej|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20091104062448/http://przestepczosczorganizowana.republika.pl/praw_pliki/historia_prawa/Kodeks_karny_1932r.pdf|publisher=Wayback Machine|accessdate=December 9, 2011}}</ref> Abortion was legalized by the Soviet Union throughout its rule of Poland, but this policy was abandoned after the fall of the USSR.  .

{{main|Abortion in the United States}}
[[File:March for Women's Lives detail.jpg|thumb|right|240px||Abortion-rights activists before the [[Washington Monument]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], at the [[March for Women's Lives]] in 2004]]
Prior to 1973, abortion was not subject to United States constitutional law, but was purely a matter for the individual states, all of which chose to apply some level of restrictions. The first legal restrictions on abortion appeared in the 1820s, forbidding abortion after the fourth month of pregnancy. By 1900, legislators at the urgings of the [[American Medical Association]] had enacted laws banning abortion in most U.S. states. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/abortionuslegal/a/abortion.htm|title=Abortion History: A History of Abortion in the United States|accessdate=2006-07-07|last=Lewis|first=Jone Johnson|work=Women's History section of About.com|publisher=About.com}}</ref> In its landmark 1973 case, ''Roe v. Wade'' where a woman challenged the [[Texas]] laws [[criminal law|criminalizing]] abortion, the U.S. Supreme Court reached two important conclusions:
* That state abortion laws are subject to the [[substantive due process|due process]] clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]; and
* That the procurement of an abortion was a constitutional right during the first and second trimesters of a pregnancy based on the constitutional ''right to privacy'', but that the state's interest in protecting "potential life" prevailed in the third trimester unless the woman's health was at risk. In subsequent rulings, the Court rejected the trimester framework altogether in favor of a cutoff at the point of fetal [[viability (fetal)|viability]] (Cf. ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'').  . 

[[Planned Parenthood]], [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]], [[National Organization for Women]], and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] are the leading abortion-rights advocacy and [[lobbying]] groups in the United States. Most major [[feminist]] organizations also support abortion-rights positions.  . 

In the [[United States]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s platform endorses the abortion-rights position, stating that abortion should be "safe, legal, and rare". <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.democrats.org/pdfs/2004platform.pdf |title=The 2004 Democratic National Platform for America |accessdate=2007-02-12 |date=2004-07-24 |publisher=[[Democratic Party (United States)|United States Democratic Party]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070208041534/http://www.democrats.org/pdfs/2004platform.pdf |archivedate = February 8, 2007}}</ref> Not all Democrats agree with the platform, however, and there is a small pro-life faction within the party, expressed in such groups as [[Democrats for Life of America]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11786788/site/newsweek/|title=The GOP's Abortion Anxiety|accessdate=2006-07-07|last=Fineman|first=Howard|coauthors=Evan Thomas|date=2006-03-20|work=Newsweek Politics|publisher=MSNBC}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Similarly, there is a small abortion-rights faction within the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].  . 

==Term controversy== . 

The terms "pro-choice" and "pro-life" are examples of [[framing (social sciences)|political framing]]. They are terms which purposely try to define their philosophies in the best possible light, while attempting to define their opposition in the worst possible light: "Pro-choice" implies the alternative viewpoint is "pro-coercion" or "anti-choice", while "pro-life" implies the alternative viewpoint is "pro-death" or "anti-life". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rnclife.org/reports/2009/spring/RNC-Spring09.pdf |title=Example of 'anti-life' terminology |format=PDF |accessdate=December 9, 2011}}</ref> Similarly each side's use of the term "rights" ("reproductive rights", "right to life of every unborn child") implies a validity in their stance, given that the presumption in language is that rights are inherently a good thing and so implies an invalidity in the viewpoint of their opponents. (In liberal democracies, a ''right'' is seen as something the state and civil society must defend, whether ''[[human rights]]'', ''[[victims' rights]]'', ''[[children's rights]]'', etc. Many states use the word ''rights'' in fundamental laws and constitutions to define basic civil principles; both the United Kingdom and the United States possess a ''Bill of Rights''.) Other examples of political framing frequently employed in this context are: "unborn baby", "unborn child", and "pre-born child". <ref>{{Cite web| last = Chamberlain|first = Pam|last2=Hardisty|first2=Jean|title=The Importance of the Political 'Framing' of Abortion|publisher=Political Research Associates|url=http://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v14n1/ReproPatriarch-07.html|accessdate = 2011-06-23}}</ref><ref>"[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/05/weekinreview/05greenhouse.html?ex=1320382800&en=724fb4ac23c8aacc&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all The Roberts Court Takes on Abortion]". ''New York Times.'' November 5, 2006. Retrieved January 18, 2008. </ref> . 

The term "pro-life" for those who are opposed to legal abortion is further objected to by activists who support the legalization of abortion because women's lives are lost due to [[unsafe abortions]] when abortion is illegal. Some who support abortion consider the term ironic since they say "pro-life" activists oppose the use of abortion procedures even when they are deemed medically necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman, or to resolve a situation that endangers both the life of the woman and the fetus to such an extent that both will die if an abortion is not performed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012|reason=previous reference did not contain it and the number of pro-life activists who would claim this is miniscule}} Members of the pro-choice movement counter the "pro-life" terminology with the argument that being pro-choice ''is'' pro-life: pro-women's lives.
