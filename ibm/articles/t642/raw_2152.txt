'''Intact dilation and extraction''' ('''IDX''') is a procedure done in late term abortion. It is also known as '''intact dilation and evacuation''',  '''dilation and extraction''' ('''D&X''', or '''DNX'''), '''intrauterine cranial decompression''' and, vernacularly in the [[United States of America|United States]], as '''partial birth abortion'''. The procedure may also be used to remove a fetus that is developed enough to require dilation of the cervix for its extraction. <ref name="extract">''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=000&invol=05-380 550 U.S. ____ (2007)]. Findlaw.com. Retrieved 2007-04-30. ("If the intact D&E procedure is truly necessary in some circumstances, it appears likely an injection that kills the fetus is an alternative under the Act that allows the doctor to perform the procedure.")</ref> . 

Though the procedure has had a low rate of use, representing 0.17% (2,232 of 1,313,000) of all abortions in the United States in the year 2000, according to voluntary responses to an [[Alan Guttmacher Institute]] survey,<ref>Guttmacher.org [http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3500603.html Abortion Incidence and Services in the United States in 2000]</ref> it has developed into a focal point of the [[abortion debate]]. In the United States, intact dilation and extraction was made illegal in most circumstances by the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] in 2003, which the U.S. Supreme Court upheld in the case of ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]''.  . 

== Intact D&X surgery ==. 
Under the Intact D&X method, the largest part of the fetus (the head) is reduced in diameter to allow vaginal passage.  According to the [[American Medical Association]], this procedure has four main elements. <ref name="AMA">[http://www.ama-assn.org/ad-com/polfind/Hlth-Ethics.pdf Late-Term Pregnancy Termination Techniques] ''American Medical Association''. H-5.982 Retrieved April 24, 2007. </ref> Usually, preliminary procedures are performed over a period of two to three days, to gradually dilate the [[cervix]] using [[laminaria]] tents (sticks of seaweed which absorb fluid and swell). Sometimes drugs such as [[pitocin]], a synthetic form of oxytocin, are used to induce labor. Once the cervix is sufficiently dilated, the doctor uses an ultrasound and [[forceps]] to grasp the [[fetus|fetus's]] leg. The fetus is turned to a [[Breech birth|breech position]], if necessary, and the doctor pulls one or both legs out of the cervix, which some refer to as 'partial birth' of the fetus. The doctor subsequently extracts the rest of the fetus, leaving only the [[head (anatomy)|head]] still inside the uterus. An incision is made at the base of the skull, a blunt dissector (such as a Kelly clamp) is inserted into the incision and opened to widen the opening,<ref name="SCOTUS">''Gonzales v.

The [[Human brain|brain]] is suctioned out, which causes the [[human skull|skull]] to collapse and allows the fetus to pass more easily through the cervix.

[[Image:Signing the Partial-Birth Abortion ban.jpg|thumb|254px|right|The signing of the ''[[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]]']] . 

In the U.S., a [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act#Partial-birth abortion defined by law|federal statute defines]] "partial-birth abortion" as any abortion in which the fetus is extracted "past the navel [of the fetus]... outside the body of the mother," or "in the case of head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the body of the mother," if the fetus has already passed. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the terms "partial-birth abortion" and "intact dilation and extraction" are basically synonymous. <ref name="SCOTUS"/>  However, there are cases where these overlapping terms do not coincide. For example, the IDX procedure may be used to remove a deceased fetus (e.g. due to a [[miscarriage]] or [[feticide]]) that is developed enough to require dilation of the cervix for its extraction. <ref name="extract" />  Removing a dead fetus does not meet the federal legal definition of "partial-birth abortion," which specifies that partial live delivery must precede "the overt act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the partially delivered living fetus."<ref>[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00001531----000-.html U.S. Code, Title 18, Part I, Chapter 74, Section 1531], "Partial-birth abortions prohibited."</ref>  Additionally, a doctor may extract a fetus past the navel and then cut through the neck of the fetus. This could fall within the terms of the statute, even though it would not result in an intact body and therefore would not be an intact dilation and extraction. <ref name="harpers" /> . 

In addition to the federal ban, there have also been a number of [[#State law|state partial-birth abortion bans]]. There, courts have found that state legislation (rather than federal legislation) intended to ban "partial-birth abortions" could be interpreted to apply to some non-intact [[dilation and evacuation]] (D&E) procedures. <ref>[http://www.aclu.org/reproductiverights/abortionbans/12669res20040326.html Abortion Bans: Myths and Facts]. American Civil Liberties Union. Accessed April 14, 2006. <br />[http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct-cgi/get-us-cite?530+914 Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U.S. 914 (2000)]</ref> Though sometimes performed during the same developmental stage wherein most IDX procedures are done, non-intact D&E is a separate procedure.  . 

There is debate over use of the term "partial-birth abortion". Those who oppose the term consider it a political term used to [[framing (social sciences)|frame]] the argument in a way which is favorable to those who seek greater legal restrictions, or a total ban, on this or all abortion procedures, and have called the alleged political framing "partial truth abortion". <ref>{{cite web|author=Miranda Kennedy|title=Partial Truth Abortion Coverage|publisher=Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting|date=March/April 2000|accessdate=2006-09-14|url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1028}}</ref> . 

==Controversy==. 
IDX is a target of pro-life advocates who believe the procedure illustrates their contention that abortion, and especially [[late-term abortion]], is unjust.

Dr. [[Martin Haskell]] has called the IDX procedure "a quick, surgical outpatient method" for late second-trimester and early third-trimester abortions. <!--
 --><ref name="presentation">Haskell, Martin. [http://www.sharonvilleclinic.com/uploads/6/2/0/0/6200039/idx.pdf Dilation and Extraction for Late Second Trimester Abortion].

 --><ref>108th Congress, 1st Session, S.3. [http://news.findlaw.com/usatoday/docs/abortion/2003s3.html Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003]. </ref> . 

According to a [[BBC]] report about the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'', "government lawyers and others who favour the ban, have said there are alternative and more widely used procedures that are still legal - which involves dismembering the fetus in the uterus."<!--
 --><ref>{{cite news | title = US top court backs abortion ban | publisher = BBC | date = 2007-04-18 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6569007.stm | accessdate = 2007-04-18 }}</ref>  An article in ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'' magazine stated that, "Defending the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban... requires arguing to judges that pulling a fetus from a woman's body in dismembered pieces is legal, medically acceptable, and safe; but that pulling a fetus out intact, so that if the woman wishes the fetus can be wrapped in a blanket and handed to her, is appropriately punishable by a fine, or up to two years' imprisonment, or both."<ref name="harpers" />  The U.S. Supreme Court has stated that intact D&X remains legal as long as there is first an "injection that kills the fetus."<ref name="extract" /> . 

There is also controversy about why this procedure is used. Although prominent defenders of the method asserted during 1995 and 1996 that it was used only or mostly in acute medical circumstances, lobbyist Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the [[National Coalition of Abortion Providers]] (a trade association of abortion providers), told the ''[[New York Times]]'' (February 26, 1997): "In the vast majority of cases, the procedure is performed on a healthy mother with a healthy fetus that is 20 weeks or more along."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/26/us/an-abortion-rights-advocate-says-he-lied-about-procedure.html|title=An abortion rights advocate says he lied about procedure|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1997-02-26|page=A11|accessdate=2009-06-08 | first=David | last=Stout}}</ref>
Some prominent pro-choice advocates quickly defended the accuracy of Fitzsimmons's statements,<ref>Ruth Padawer, [http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/pba/PBA%20activists%20lied.pdf "Pro-choice advocates admit to deception"], ''Bergen Record'', February 27, 1997. </ref> whilst others condemned Fitzsimmons as self-serving. <ref>Melanie Conklin, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1295/is_n9_v61/ai_19732071/  "Whatever happened to the abortion lobbyist who repented?"], ''The Progressive'', September, 1997. </ref> . 

In support of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, a nurse who witnessed three IDX procedures found them deeply disturbing, and described one performed on a 26½-week [[fetus]] with [[Down Syndrome]] in testimony before a Judiciary subcommittee of the US House of Representatives. <ref>[http://judiciary.house.gov/legacy/215.htm Testimony of Brenda Pratt Shafer, R.N.] Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee On The Constitution, U.S. House Of Representatives, March 21, 1996. Retrieved May 2, 2007. </ref> . 

A journalist observed three IDX and two D&E procedures involving fetuses ranging from 19 to 23 weeks. She "watched for any signs of fetal distress, but ... [she] could see no response, no reflexive spasm, nothing. Whether this was a result of the anesthesia or an undeveloped fetal system for pain sensitivity, one thing was clear: There was no discernible response by the fetus."<ref name="salon">{{cite journal | last = Woodbury | first = Margaret A. | title = A doctor's right to choose | journal = Salon.com | date = 2002-07-24 | url = http://archive.salon.com/mwt/feature/2002/07/24/late_term/index.html | accessdate = 2007-04-29 }}</ref> . 

Abortion provider [[Warren Hern]] asserted in 2003 that "No peer-reviewed articles or case reports have ever been published describing anything such as 'partial-birth' abortion, 'Intact D&E' (for 'dilation and extraction'), or any of its synonyms."<ref>Hern, Warren.  "Did I Violate the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban?" [http://www.slate.com/id/2090215/ (''Slate'', October 22, 2003)]. </ref>  Therefore, Hern expressed uncertainty about what all of these terms mean. The U.S. Supreme Court held in ''Gonzales v. Carhart'' that these terms of the federal statute are not vague because the statute specifically detailed the procedure being banned: it specified anatomical landmarks past which the fetus must not be delivered, and criminalized such a procedure only if an "overt" fatal act is performed on the fetus after "partial delivery."<ref name="SCOTUS"/> . 

==In the United States==. 
===Federal law===. 
{{Main|Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act}}
Since 1995, led by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] in [[United States Congress|Congress]], the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] have moved several times to pass measures banning the procedure. Congress passed two such measures by wide margins during [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton's presidency]], but Clinton [[veto]]ed those bills in April 1996 and October 1997 on the grounds that they did not include health exceptions. Subsequent congressional attempts at overriding the veto were unsuccessful. Doctors "have been successfully sued for failure to refer patients for late-term abortions in cases of fetal abnormalities."<ref>Trupin, Suzanne R. [http://www.emedicine.com/MED/topic5.htm Abortion] ''emedicine.com''. Accessed April 25, 2006. </ref> . 

A major part of the legal battle over banning the procedure relates to health exceptions, which would permit the procedure in special circumstances. The 1973 Supreme Court decision ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', which declared many state-level abortion restrictions unconstitutional, allowed states to ban abortions of post-viable fetuses unless an abortion was "necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother."  The companion ruling, ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', upheld against a vagueness challenge a state law that defined health to include mental as well as physical health. The Court has never explicitly held, as a matter of constitutional law, that states have to allow abortions of post-viable fetuses if doing so is necessary for the woman's mental health, but many read ''Doe'' as implying as much. The concern that the health exception can be read so liberally partly explains why supporters of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act did not want to include one.  . 

In 2003, the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] (H.R. 760, S. 3) was signed into law; the House passed it on October 2 with a vote of 281-142, the Senate passed it on October 21 with a vote of 64-34, and President [[George W. Bush]] signed it into law on November 5.  . 

Beginning in early 2004, the [[Planned Parenthood Federation of America]], the [[National Abortion Federation]], and abortion doctors in Nebraska challenged the ban in [[United States district court|federal district courts]] in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|Northern District of California]], [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|Southern District of New York]], and [[United States District Court for the District of Nebraska|District of Nebraska]]. All three district courts ruled the ban unconstitutional that same year. Their respective [[United States court of appeals|federal courts of appeals]]&mdash;the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]], respectively&mdash;affirmed these rulings on appeal.  . 

The three cases were all appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], and were consolidated into the case ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]''. On April 18, 2007, the Supreme Court voted to uphold the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] by a decision of 5-4. <ref>{{cite news | first=Mark | last=Sherman | coauthors= | title=Court Backs ban on abortion procedure |date=April 18, 2007 | publisher= SFGate | url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/04/18/national/w070844D25.DTL&type=politics | accessdate = 2007-04-18}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Justice [[Anthony Kennedy|Kennedy]] wrote for the majority and was joined by Justices [[Clarence Thomas|Thomas]], [[Antonin Scalia|Scalia]], [[Samuel Alito|Alito]], and Chief Justice [[John G. Roberts|Roberts]]. A dissenting opinion was written by Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]] and joined by Justices [[John Paul Stevens|Stevens]], [[David Souter|Souter]] and [[Stephen Breyer|Breyer]].  . 

===State law===. 
Many states have [[Late-term abortion#Legal restrictions on later abortion|bans on late-term abortions]] which apply to the IDX procedure if it is performed after [[Fetus#Viability|viability]].  . 

Many states have also passed bans specifically on the IDX procedure. The first was Ohio, which in 1995 enacted a law that referred to the procedure as ''dilation and extraction''. In 1997, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit found the law unconstitutional on the grounds that it placed a substantial and unconstitutional obstacle in the path of women seeking pre-viability abortions in the [[second trimester]].  . 

Between 1995 and 2000, 28 more states passed Partial-Birth Abortion bans, all similar to the proposed federal bans and all lacking an exemption for the health of the woman. Many of these state laws faced legal challenges, with Nebraska's the first to reach decision in ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]''. The Federal District Court held Nebraska's statute unconstitutional on two counts. One being the bill's language was too broad, potentially rendering a range of abortion procedures illegal, and thus, creating an undue burden on a woman's ability to choose. The other count was the bill failed to provide a necessary exception for the health of the woman. The decision was appealed to and affirmed by both the Eighth Circuit and the Supreme Court on June 2000, thus resolving the legal challenges to similar state bans nationwide.  . 

Since the ''Stenberg v. Carhart'' decision, Virginia, Michigan, and Utah have adopted legislation very similar to the Nebraska law overturned as unconstitutional. The  Michigan law was similarly struck down for broadness and failure to provide a health exemption. Utah's law remains on the books, pending trial, but is unenforceable under a court-ordered preliminary injunction. Virginia's Law was initially ruled invalid, but was reversed and remanded to the District Court in the wake of the Gonzales v. Carhart decision, where it was upheld as constitutional.  This is despite the fact the Virginia law criminalizes abortions for accidental D & X procedures, as well as intentional D & X.  . 

In 2000 Ohio introduced another "partial-birth abortion" ban. The law differed from previous attempts at the ban in that it specifically excluded D&amp;E procedures, while also providing a narrow health exception. This law was upheld on appeal to the Sixth Circuit in 2003 on the grounds that "it permitted the partial birth procedure when necessary to prevent significant health risks." . 

In 2003 the Michigan Senate introduced Senate Bill No. 395. The bill, which would change the legal definition of birth, would in effect ban partial birth abortions. The definition of birth as defined in the bill was that once any part of the body had passed beyond the vaginal plane of introitus it is considered a birth. The bill included an exemption for the mother's health. The bill was passed by both the Senate and House of Representatives but was vetoed by governor [[Jennifer Granholm]].  . 

==In other countries==. 
Questioned about [[United Kingdom]] government policy on the issue in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], [[Kay Andrews, Baroness Andrews|Baroness Andrews]] stated that "We are not aware of the procedure referred to as 'partial-birth abortion' being used in Great Britain. It is the [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]]' (RCOG) belief that this method of abortion is never used as a primary or pro-active technique and is only ever likely to be performed in unforeseen circumstances in order to reduce maternal [[death|mortality]] or severe [[morbidity]]."<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030512/text/30512w05.htm#30512w05_sbhd0 Text of a written answer to a parliamentary question] at The House of Lords [[Hansard]].
