The '''abortion debate''' refers to discussion and controversy surrounding the moral and legal status of [[abortion]]. The two main groups involved in the abortion debate are the self-described "[[Support for the legalization of abortion|pro-choice]]" movement (emphasizing the right of women to choose whether they wish to bring a fetus to term) and the self-described "[[Opposition to the legalization of abortion|pro-life]]" movement (emphasizing the right of the unborn child to be born). Both of these are considered [[loaded word|loaded terms]] in general media where terms such as "abortion rights" or "anti abortion" are preferred. <ref>For example: {{cite web|title=Wall Street Journal style guide: Vol. 23, No. 1|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/styleandsubstance/2010/01/31/vol-23-no-1/|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=2011-11-04|date=2010-01-31}}</ref> Each movement has, with varying results, sought to influence public opinion and to attain legal support for its position. In some cases, the abortion debate has led to the use of [[Abortion-related violence|violence]].  . 

[[Abortion law]] varies between jurisdictions.  For example, [[Abortion in Canada|in Canada]] abortion is available on demand,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=abortion-on-demand&r=66 |title=abortion on demand |accessdate=2007-05-01 |work=Dictionary.com |quote=(1) the right of a woman to have an abortion during the first six months of a pregnancy; (2) an abortion performed on a woman solely at her own request}}</ref> while [[Abortion in Ireland|in Ireland]] abortions are illegal. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7041048.stm | work=BBC News | title=Divisions deep over abortion ban | date=2007-10-12 | accessdate=2010-03-30| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100327184701/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7041048.stm| archivedate= 27 March 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> . 

==Overview==. 
In ancient times, abortion, along with [[infanticide]], had been considered a matter of family planning, gender selection, population control, and the property rights of the patriarch. <ref>See generally, "The Kindness of Strangers: The Abandonment of Children in Western Europe from Late Antiquity to the Renaissance", John Boswell ISBN 978-0-226-06712-4 Nov. 1998, Intro. </ref> Rarely were the rights of the prospective mother, much less the prospective child, taken into consideration. <ref>See generally Spivack, Carla, ''To Bring Down the Flowers: The Cultural Context of Abortion Law in Early Modern England''. Available at SSRN: [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1132482] Introduction</ref> Although generally legal, the morality of abortion, birth control and child abandonment (as a form of infanticide) was sometimes discussed. Then, as now, these discussions often concerned the nature of man, the existence of a soul, when life begins, and the [[beginning of human personhood]].  . 

While the practice of infanticide (as a form of family planning) has largely died out, child abandonment, [[birth control]], and abortion are still practiced; and their morality and legality continues to be debated. While modern debates about abortion retain some of the language of these older debates, the terminology has often acquired new meanings. Reason is now seen as a human ability rather than as a spirit personified. <ref>[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/american/reason#reason_27 MacMillan's]</ref> . 

Any discussion of the putative [[personhood]] of the fetus will be complicated by the current legal status of children. They are not full persons<ref>[http://floridalegalanswers.com/dic/p.html "Person"]</ref> at law until they have reached the age of majority and are deemed able to enter into contracts and sue or be sued at law. However, for the past two centuries, they have been treated as persons for the limited purposes of [[Offence against the person]] law. Furthermore, as one [[New Jersey Superior Court]] judge noted, . 

<blockquote> If a fetus is a person, it is a person in very special circumstances – it exists entirely within the body of another much larger person and usually cannot be the object of direct action by another person. <ref>[http://www.napil.com/PersonalInjuryCaseLawDetail40130/Page2.htm ''State v Loce''] September 6, 1991</ref></blockquote> . 

This judgement discusses the logistic difficulties of treating the fetus as an "object of direct action".  . 

Opinions in the current debate range from complete prohibition, even if done to save the woman's life,<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/opinion/27kristof.html?partner=rss&emc=rss "Sister Margaret's Choice"] May 27, 2010</ref> to complete legalization with public funding, [[abortion in Canada|as in Canada]]. <ref name="AmmerManson2009">{{cite book|author1=Christine Ammer|author2=JoAnn E.

==Terminology==. 
Many of the terms used in the debate are seen as [[Framing (social sciences)|political framing]]: terms used to validate one's own stance while invalidating the opposition's.  For example, the labels "pro-choice" and "pro-life" imply endorsement of widely held values such as [[liberty]] and [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], while suggesting that the opposition must be "''anti''-choice" or "''anti''-life" (alternatively "pro-''coercion''" or "pro-''death''"). <ref>{{cite book |title=Handbook of Constructionist Research |author=Holstein and Gubrium |publisher= Guilford Press |year=2008 |isbn=}}</ref>   Terms used by some in the debate to describe their opponents include "''pro-abortion''" or "''pro-abort''". However, these terms do not always reflect a political view or fall along a binary; in one [[Public Religion Research Institute]] poll, seven in ten Americans described themselves as "pro-choice" while almost two-thirds described themselves as "pro-life."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://publicreligion.org/research/2011/06/committed-to-availability-conflicted-about-morality-what-the-millennial-generation-tells-us-about-the-future-of-the-abortion-debate-and-the-culture-wars/ |publisher=Public Religion Research Institute |title=Committed to Availability, Conflicted about Morality: What the Millennial Generation Tells Us about the Future of the Abortion Debate and the Culture Wars |date=June 9, 2011}}</ref> . 

Appeals are often made in the abortion debate to the [[rights]] of the [[fetus]], pregnant woman, or other parties.  Such appeals can generate confusion if the ''type'' of rights is not specified (whether [[Civil rights|civil]], [[Natural rights|natural]], or otherwise) or if it is simply ''assumed'' that the right appealed to takes precedence over all other competing rights (an example of [[begging the question]]).  . 

The appropriate terms with which to designate the human organism prior to birth are also debated. The medical terms "[[embryo]]" and "[[fetus]]" are seen by some pro-life advocates as [[dehumanization|dehumanizing]]. <ref>Brennan 'Dehumanizing the vulnerable' 2000</ref><ref>{{cite journal |journal=Princeton Progressive Review |date=February 1996 |url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/rauch/nvp/consistent/naomi_wolf.html |author1=Getek, Kathryn |author2=Cunningham, Mark |title=A Sheep in Wolf's Clothing – Language and the Abortion Debate}}</ref> . 

==Political debate==. 
Politics refers to the processes, defined and limited through legal documents, by which decisions (laws) are made in governments.  In politics, [[Civil rights|rights]] are the protections and privileges legally granted to citizens by the government. In a democracy, certain rights are considered to be [[inalienable]], and thus not subject to grant or withdrawal by government. Regarding [[abortion law]], the political debate usually surrounds a right to [[privacy]], and when or how a government may regulate abortion.  There is abundant debate regarding the extent of abortion regulation.  Some pro-choice advocates argue that it should be illegal for governments to regulate abortion any more than other medical practices. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bccla.org/positions/privateoff/72abortion.html |title=Abortion |accessdate=2007-05-24 |work=Positions |publisher=British Columbia Civil Liberties Association |quote=…rights call for complete legal freedom to secure an abortion, in the sense that the legal status of abortion should be the same as that of other medical services that a doctor provides to a patient}}</ref>  On both sides of the debate, some argue{{Who|date=October 2011}} that governments should be permitted to prohibit elective abortions after the 20th week,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pagerender.fcgi?artid=1455357&pageindex=2 |title=Abortion |accessdate=2007-05-24 |date=December 1973|work=Where We Stand—CMA Position Papers |publisher=California Medical Association |page=43 |quote=Good medical practice indicates that abortion should not be performed after the 20th week of pregnancy}}</ref> [[Point of fetal viability|viability]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kent.ac.uk/sspssr/research/papers/legalpro.pdf |title=Abortion issues today – a position paper |accessdate=2007-05-24 |last=Lee |first=Ellie |coauthors=Ann Furedi |date=February 2002|format=PDF |work=Legal Issues for Pro-Choice Opinion – Abortion Law in Practice |publisher=University of Kent, Canterbury, CT2 7NY, UK |page=2 |quote=While most people have no difficulty accepting the legality of abortion at early stages of pregnancy, fewer are so sure about their position as pregnancy progresses – especially when the fetus is perceived to be 'viable'

===Privacy===. 
The [[Privacy law|right to privacy]], while not spelled out in the constitutions of most sovereign nations, nonetheless is understood to be foundational to a functioning democracy. In general the right to privacy can be found to rest on the provisions of ''[[habeas corpus]]'', which first found official expression under Henry II in 11th century England, but has precedent in Anglo-Saxon law. This provision guarantees the right to freedom from arbitrary government interference, as well as due process of law. This conception of the right to privacy is operant in all countries which have adopted [[English common law]] through Acts of Reception. The [[Law of the United States]] rests on English common law by this means.  . 

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' has stated that the issue of bodily [[privacy]] is "the core" of the abortion debate. <ref name="Time">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903358,00.html?promoid=googlep|title=Abortion and Privacy|accessdate=2007-05-25 |date=1972-03-13|publisher=TIME}}</ref>  Time defined privacy, in relation to abortion, as the ability of a woman to "decide what happens to her own body". <ref name="Time"/> In political terms, privacy can be understood as a condition in which one is not observed or disturbed by government. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/privacy?view=uk |title=Privacy |accessdate=2007-05-24 |work=Compact Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=AskOxford.com}}</ref> . 

Traditionally, American courts have located the [[Privacy laws of the United States|right to privacy]] in the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]], [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], as well as the penumbra of the [[Bill of Rights]]. The landmark decision, ''[[Roe v Wade]]'' relied on the 14th Amendment which guarantees that federal rights shall be applied equally to all persons born in the United States. The 14th Amendment has given rise to the doctrine of [[Substantive due process]], which is said to guarantee various privacy rights, including the right to [http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Substantive+Due+Process bodily integrity]. In Canada, the courts have located privacy rights in the security of persons clause of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. Section 7 of that charter echoes language used in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], which also guarantees security of persons.  . 

Eileen L. McDonagh explains privacy in US law:<blockquote>Although not widely understood, there are in fact two components to the right to bodily integrity and liberty: the right of a person to choose how to live her own life and the right of a person to consent to the effects of a private party on her bodily integrity and liberty. In the context of constitutional guarantees, a person's right to consent to "what is done" to her body is an even stronger right than a person's right to choose "what to do" with her life...Since there are two components to the right to bodily integrity and liberty--choice and consent--once the state designates the fetus as an entity separate from the woman, her right to terminate pregnancy stems not only from her right to make a choice about her liberty, but more fundamentally, from her right to consent to how the fetus, as another entity, affects her body and liberty. <ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3243/is_3_62/ai_n28731577/?tag=content;col1 "My body, my consent: securing the constitutional right to abortion funding"], Eileen L. McDonagh, ''Albany Law Review'', Spring 1999</ref></blockquote> . 

While governments are allowed to invade the privacy of their citizens in some cases, they are expected to protect privacy in all cases lacking a [[strict scrutiny|compelling state interest]]. In the US, the compelling state interest test has been developed in accordance with the standards of strict scrutiny.  In ''Roe v Wade'', the Court decided that the state has an "important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life" from the point of viability on, but that prior to viability, the woman's fundamental rights are  more compelling than that of the state.  .

===U.S. judicial involvement===. 
''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' struck down state laws banning abortion in 1973. Over 20 [[:Category:United States abortion case law|cases]] have addressed abortion law in the [[Abortion in the United States|United States]], all of which upheld ''Roe v. Wade''. Since ''Roe'', abortion has been legal throughout the country, but states have placed varying regulations on it, from requiring [[Minors and abortion|parental involvement]] in a minor's abortion to restricting [[late-term abortion]]s.  . 

Legal criticisms of the ''Roe'' decision address many points, among them are several suggesting that it is an overreach of judicial powers,<ref>{{cite journal| author= William Saletan |url= http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/May-June-2005/feature_saleton_mayjun05.msp |title= Unbecoming Justice Blackmun |work= Legal Affairs |date= May/June 2005}}</ref> or that it was not properly based on the Constitution,<ref>{{cite journal| author= Ely, John Hart. |url= http://www.timothypcarney.com/wages-wolf.htm |title= The Wages of Crying Wolf |publisher= [[Yale Law Journal]] |date= 1973  <!--accessdate= 4 Oct 09-->}}</ref> or that it is an example of [[judicial activism]] and that it should be overturned so that abortion law can be decided by legislatures. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/yourlife/health/women/articles/2005/07/26/why_i_vetoed_contraception_bill/ |title=Why I Vetoed Contraception Bill |accessdate=2007-05-24 |last=Romney |first=Mitt |authorlink=Mitt Romney |date=2005-07-26 |publisher=The Boston Globe |quote=…avoiding the bitter battles engendered by 'one size fits all' judicial pronouncements.

===Canadian judicial involvement===. 
{{Main|Abortion in Canada}}
With ''[[R v. Morgentaler]]'', the Supreme Court of Canada removed abortion from the Criminal Code. Relying on the security of person clause of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], the court determined that, while the state has an interest in protecting the fetus "at some point", this interest cannot override that of the pregnant woman because: "the right to security of the person of a pregnant woman was infringed more than was required to achieve the objective of protecting the fetus, and the means were not reasonable." The only laws currently governing abortion in Canada are those which govern other medical procedures, such as those regulating licencing of facilities, the training of medical personnel, and the like.  . 

Because the courts did not specifically establish abortion as a right, Parliament has leave to legislate on this aspect of the matter; and in 1989, the Progressive Conservative government attempted to do just that. A bill was introduced that would allow abortion only if two doctors certified that the woman's health was in danger. This bill passed the House of Commons but was defeated by a tie vote in the Senate.  . 

Several additional cases have considered further issues.  . 

Although the courts have not ruled on the question of fetal personhood, the question has been raised in two cases, ''[[Tremblay v. Daigle]]'' and ''[[R. v. Sullivan]]''. Both cases relied on the [[born alive rule]], inherited from English common law, to determine that the fetus was not a person at law.  . 

Two further cases are notable: ''[[Dobson (Litigation Guardian of) v. Dobson]]'', and ''Winnipeg Child & Family Services (Northwest Area) v. G . (D.F.), [I9971 3 S.C.R. 925 M'', which dismissed so-called fetal abuse charges.  . 

===Effects of legalization/illegalization===. 
Pro-choice advocates argue that illegalization of abortion increases the incidence of [[unsafe abortion]]s, as the availability of professional abortion services decreases, and leads to increased [[maternal mortality]]. According to a global study collaboratively conducted by the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[Guttmacher Institute]], most unsafe abortions occur [[abortion law|where abortion is illegal]]. <ref>{{Cite journal

The [[Legalized abortion and crime effect|effect on crime of legalized abortion]] is a subject of controversy, with proponents of the theory generally arguing that "unwanted children" are more likely to become criminals and that an inverse correlation is observed between the availability of abortion and subsequent crime.  . 

==Ethical debate==. 
{{POV-check|date=January 2009}}
{{Main|Philosophical aspects of the abortion debate|}}
[[Ethics]] refers to "[[moral philosophy]]", or the study of [[values]] and the analysis of [[right and wrong]]. The ethical debate over abortion usually surrounds the issues of whether a fetus has [[rights]], in particular a [[right to life]], and whether the pregnant woman's rights over her own body justify abortion ''even if'' the fetus has a right to life.  For many, there is a strong association between [[Religion and abortion|religion and abortion ethics]].  . 

Ethical question regarding abortion usually include: . 

* Are embryos, zygotes and fetuses "persons" worthy of legal protections?
* Should the ''potential'' to be a person give embryos, zygotes and fetuses a [[right to life]]?
* Does a fetus gain rights as it gets closer to birth?
* Does a woman have an absolute right to determine what happens in and to her body?
* Is abortion acceptable in cases of rape, incest, or contraception failure?
* Is abortion acceptable in cases where the fetus is deformed?
* Is abortion acceptable in cases where if the pregnancy were to continue, it would pose a direct threat to the life of the mother?<ref name=routledge>[http://books.google.com/books?id=fnbtxGXu39sC&pg=PA21&dq=ethics+abortion#v=onepage&q=abortion&f=false Ethics: contemporary readings]  By Harry J. Gensler, Earl W. Spurgin, James Swindal</ref><ref name=complete>[http://books.google.com/books?id=0B4WNVdK_Q4C&pg=PA212&dq=ethics+abortion#v=onepage&q=ethics%20abortion&f=false The complete idiot's guide to understanding ethics] By David Ingram, Jennifer A. Parks</ref> . 

===Question of personhood===. 
Establishing the point in time when a zygote/embryo/fetus becomes a "person" is open to debate since the definition of [[personhood]] is not universally agreed upon.  . 

Philosophers have traditionally declared that some characteristic of reason ought to be included in the definition of person, and the term "person" is not defined in standard science texts.  [[Peter Singer]] argued that something can only be a [[person]] if it is [[awareness|self-aware]] and has [[Time|temporal]] awareness. Therefore, abortion is morally acceptable, because a [[fetus]] does not meet this definition of personhood. Singer also concluded that [[infanticide]] would be permissible until the 3rd month after birth, because, at that point, self-awareness has still not been acquired. <ref>Singer, P. (1976). ''Practical ethics,'' chap. 6. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. </ref> . 

Additionally, "[[person]]" has several, poorly defined meanings in law, with children and the mentally infirm occupying a grey area. Children are not considered persons until they reach the age of majority and are able to enter into legally binding contracts and sue or be sued. For the purposes of Offenses against the person law, however, they are considered to be persons. According to [[Bouvier's Law Dictionary]]<ref>[http://www.supremelaw.org/ref/dict/bldp1.htm Bouvier's Law Dictionary] person</ref> in 1839, women, children, and slaves were considered persons, but with various limitations. Today, only children have limited personhood under the law.  If the fetus is a person in some sense, it is nonetheless living inside the body of someone who is a full person at law.  . 

===Debates within the abortion debate===. 
Many of the views in favor of and against the right to abortion are framed in the context of other debates whose arguments and implications relate directly to the topic of abortion.  . 

====Fetal pain debate====. 
{{Main|Neonatal perception}}

Fetal pain, its existence, and its implications are part of a larger debate about abortion.

====Fetal personhood debate====. 
{{Main|Beginning of human personhood}}
Although the two main sides of the abortion debate tend to agree that fetuses are biologically and genetically human (that is, of the human species), they often differ in their view on whether or not a fetus is, in any of various ways, a ''[[person]]''. Pro-life supporters argue that abortion is morally wrong on the basis that a fetus is an innocent [[human]] [[person]]<ref>Warren, 1973</ref> or because a fetus is a potential life that will, in most cases, develop into a fully functional human being. <ref>http://www.str.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=5187</ref>  Others reject this position by drawing a distinction between ''human being'' and ''human person'', arguing that while the fetus is ''innocent'' and ''biologically human'', it is not a ''person'' with a ''right to life''. <ref>Warren 1973: 457.  See also Tooley 1972: 40–43; Singer 2000: 126–28 and 155–156; and [[Consciousness#Consciousness as the basis of personal identity|John Locke]].  The term ''person'' may be used to denote a ''psychological'' property (being rational and self-conscious), a ''moral'' property (having a right to life), or both. </ref>  In support of this distinction, some propose a list of criteria as markers of [[personhood]].  For example, [[Mary Ann Warren]] suggests [[consciousness]] (at least the capacity to feel pain), [[reasoning]], [[self-motivation]], the ability to [[Communication|communicate]], and [[self-awareness]]. <ref>Warren 1973: 458. </ref>  According to Warren, a being need not exhibit all of these criteria to qualify as a person with a right to life, but if a being exhibits ''none'' of them (or perhaps only one), then it is certainly not a person.  Warren concludes that as the fetus satisfies only one criterion, consciousness (and this only after it becomes [[fetal pain|susceptible to pain]]),<ref>Warren 1973: 458–459</ref> the fetus is not a person and abortion is therefore morally permissible.  Other philosophers apply similar criteria, concluding that a fetus lacks a right to life because it lacks self-consciousness,<ref>Tooley 1972: 44. </ref> rationality,<ref>Singer 2000: 128 and 156–157. </ref> and autonomy. <ref>McMahan 2002: 260</ref> These lists diverge over precisely ''which'' features confer a right to life,<ref>It is similarly unclear ''which'' features one must have a natural capacity for, in order to have a right to life (cf Schwarz 1990: 105–109), or ''which'' features constitute a "future like ours". </ref> but tend to propose various ''developed'' psychological features not found in fetuses.  . 

Critics of this typically argue that the proposed criteria for personhood would disqualify two classes of ''born'' human beings – reversibly [[coma]]tose patients, and human infants – from having a right to life, since they, like fetuses, are not self-conscious, do not communicate, and so on. <ref>Marquis 1989: 197; Schwarz 1990: 89</ref>  Defenders of the proposed criteria may respond that the reversibly comatose ''do'' satisfy the relevant criteria because they "retain all their ''unconscious'' mental states". <ref>Stretton 2004: 267, original emphasis; see also Singer 2000: 137; Boonin 2003: 64–70</ref>  Warren concedes that infants are not "persons" by her proposed criteria,<ref>Warren 1982</ref> and on that basis she and others concede that [[infanticide]] could be morally acceptable under some circumstances (for example if the infant is severely disabled<ref>Singer 2000: 186–193</ref> or in order to save the lives of several other infants<ref>McMahan 2002: 359–360</ref>).  Critics may see such concessions as an indication that the right to life cannot be adequately defined by reference to developed psychological features.  . 

An alternative approach is to base personhood or the right to life on a being's ''natural'' or ''inherent'' capacities.  On this approach, a being [[Essential property|essentially]] has a right to life if it has a ''natural capacity'' to develop the relevant psychological features; and, since human beings do have this natural capacity, they essentially have a right to life beginning at [[Conception (biology)|conception]] (or whenever they come into existence). <ref>Lee 1996 and 2004: Schwarz 1990: 91–93. </ref>  Critics of this position argue that mere genetic potential is not a plausible basis for respect (or for the right to life), and that basing a right to life on natural capacities would lead to the counterintuitive position that [[anencephaly|anencephalic]] infants, irreversibly comatose patients, and brain-dead patients kept alive on a [[medical ventilator]], are all persons with a right to life. <ref>Stretton 2004: 274–281. </ref> Respondents to this criticism argue that the noted human cases in fact would not be classified as persons as they do not have a natural capacity to develop any psychological features. <ref>Schwarz 1990: 52. </ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prolifeadvocate.us/persnbw2.html |title=Christian Research Journal, Summer 1991, page 28 – When Does a Human Become a Person?|accessdate=2010-02-18 |last=Beckwith |first=Francis J. |year=1991}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cedarville.edu/centerforbioethics/resources/articles/conception.pdf |format=PDF|title=Ethics & Medicine, volume 19:1 – The conception view of personhood: a review |accessdate=2010-02-18 |last=Sullivan|first=Dennis M|year=2003}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Also, in a view that favors benefiting even unconceived but [[potential person|potential future persons]], it has been argued as justified to abort an [[unintended pregnancy]] in favor for conceiving a new child later in better conditions. <ref name=Savulescu2002>''Abortion, embryo destruction and the future of value argument'' By J Savulescu.

[[Image:Pro-Life Demonstration at Supreme Court.jpg|thumb|Members of [[Bound4LIFE]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] symbolically cover their mouths with red tape.]] . 

Philosophers such as [[Aquinas]] use the concept of [[individuation]]. They argue that abortion is not permissible from the point at which individual human identity is realised. [[Anthony Kenny]] argues that this can be derived from everyday beliefs and language and one can legitimately say "if my mother had had an abortion six months into her pregnancy, she would have killed me" then one can reasonably infer that at six months the "me" in question would have been an existing person with a valid claim to life. Since division of the zygote into twins through the process of [[twins|monozygotic twinning]] can occur until the fourteenth day of pregnancy, Kenny argues that individual identity is obtained at this point and thus abortion is not permissible after two weeks. <ref>A. Kenny, Reason and Religion: Essays in Philosophical Theology (Oxford: Basil Blackwell), 1987</ref> . 

===Arguments in favor of the right to abortion===. 
====Bodily rights====. 
An argument first presented by [[Judith Jarvis Thomson]] states that ''even if'' the fetus has a right to life, abortion is morally permissible because a woman has a right to control her own body. Thomson's variant of this argument draws an analogy between forcing a woman to continue an unwanted pregnancy and forcing a person's body to be used as a [[dialysis]] machine for another person suffering from [[kidney failure]].  It is argued that just as it would be permissible to "unplug" and thereby cause the death of the person who is using one's kidneys, so it is permissible to abort the fetus (who similarly, it is said, has no right to use one's body against one's will).  . 

Critics of this argument generally argue that there are morally relevant disanalogies between abortion and the kidney failure scenario.  For example, it is argued that the fetus is the woman's child as opposed to a mere stranger;<ref>Schwarz 1990; McMahan 2002</ref> that abortion ''kills'' the fetus rather than merely letting it die;<ref>Schwarz 1990; McMahan 2002; Lee 1996</ref> and that in the case of pregnancy arising from voluntary intercourse, the woman has either tacitly consented to the fetus using her body,<ref>Warren 1973</ref> or has a duty to allow it to use her body since she herself is responsible for its need to use her body. <ref>McMahan 2002</ref> Some writers defend the analogy against these objections, arguing that the disanalogies are morally irrelevant or do not apply to abortion in the way critics have claimed. <ref>Boonin 2003: ch 4</ref> . 

Alternative scenarios have been put forth as more accurate and realistic representations of the moral issues present in abortion. [[John Noonan]] proposes the scenario of a family who was found to be liable for frostbite finger loss suffered by a dinner guest whom they refused to allow to stay overnight, although it was very cold outside and the guest showed signs of being sick. It is argued that just as it would not be permissible to refuse temporary accommodation for the guest to protect them from physical harm, it would not be permissible to refuse temporary accommodation of a fetus. <ref>''The Morality of abortion: legal and historical perspectives'' John T. Noonan, Harvard University Press, 1970 ISBN 0-674-58725-1</ref> . 

Other critics claim that there is a difference between artificial and extraordinary means of preservation, such as medical treatment, kidney dialysis, and blood transfusions, and normal and natural means of preservation, such as gestation, childbirth, and breastfeeding. They argue that if a baby was born into an environment in which there was no replacement available for her mother's breast milk, and the baby would either breastfeed or starve, the mother would have to allow the baby to breastfeed.  But the mother would never have to give the baby a blood transfusion, no matter what the circumstances were.  The difference between breastfeeding in that scenario and blood transfusions is the difference between using your body as a kidney dialysis machine, and gestation and childbirth. <ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.equipresources.org/atf/cf/%7B9C4EE03A-F988-4091-84BD-F8E70A3B0215%7D/JAA025.pdf |format=PDF|journal=Christian Research Journal |volume=30 |issue=4 |title=Suffer the violinist: Why the pro-abortion argument from bodily autonomy fails |accessdate=2009-10-25 |last=Poupard |first=Richard J |year=2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Koukl G |author2=Klusendorf S |title=Making Abortion Unthinkable: The Art of Pro-Life Persuasion |publisher=STR Press |location=California |year=2001 |page=86}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Nathanson, Bernard |author2=Ostling, Richard |title=Aborting America |publisher=Double Day |location=Garden City |year=1979 |isbn=0-385-14461-X}}</ref><ref>{{cite video | people = [[Peter Kreeft|Kreeft, Peter]]; Boonin, David | title = "Is Abortion Morally Justifiable in a Free Society?"

====Sexual emancipation and equality====. 
Some argue that women's freedoms are limited until they can have the right to abortion on demand and to walk away from parenthood like men can. Governments that ban abortion arguably burden women with certain duties that men (who, too, are responsible for the pregnancy) are not also held accountable to, therefore, creating a [[double standard]]. <ref>http://revcom.us/a/165/ST_abortion-en.html</ref> Margaret Sanger wrote: "No woman can call herself free until she can choose consciously whether she will or will not be a mother."<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/abortion/mother/for_1.shtml#h4</ref> Denying the right to abortion can be construed from this perspective as a form of [[oppression of women|female oppression]] under a [[patriarchy|patriarchal system]], perpetuating inequality between the sexes. Among pro-choice advocates, sexual-equality discussion often involves the additional debate regarding to what degree the potential father should have a choice in deciding whether or not to abort the developing child.  . 

===Arguments against the right to abortion===. 
====Discrimination==== . 

The book ''Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation'' presents the argument that abortion involves unjust [[discrimination]] against the unborn.  According to this argument, those who deny that fetuses have a right to life do not value ''all'' human life, but instead select arbitrary characteristics (such as particular levels of physical or psychological development) as giving some human beings more value or rights than others. <ref>"Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation" (1983), by Ronald Reagan, William P. Clark, Brian P. Johnston, Wanda Franz. New Regency Pub, ISBN 0-9641125-3-1</ref> . 

In contrast, philosophers who define the right to life by reference to particular levels of physical or psychological development typically maintain that such characteristics are morally relevant,<ref>Singer 2000: 217–18; McMahan 2002: 242–3; Boonin 2003: 126</ref> and reject the assumption that all human life necessarily has value (or that membership in the species ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' is in itself morally relevant). <ref>Singer 2000: 221–2; McMahan 2002: 214; Boonin 2003: 25</ref> . 

====Deprivation====. 
{{Further2|[[Philosophical aspects of the abortion debate#The deprivation argument|Philosophical aspects of the abortion debate]]}}
The argument of deprivation states that abortion is morally wrong because it deprives the fetus of a valuable future. <ref>Marquis 1989.  See also Stone 1987. </ref>  On this account, killing an ''adult'' human being is wrong because it deprives the victim of a ''future like ours''—a future containing highly valuable or desirable experiences, activities, projects, and enjoyments. <ref>Marquis 1989: 189–190</ref> If a being has such a future, then (according to the argument) killing that being would seriously harm it and hence would be seriously wrong. <ref>Marquis 1989: 190.  The type of wrongness appealed to here is presumptive or [[prima facie]] wrongness: it may be overridden in exceptional circumstances. </ref> But since a fetus does have such a future, the "overwhelming majority" of deliberate abortions are placed in the "same moral category" as killing an innocent adult human being. <ref>Marquis 1989: 183. </ref>  Not ''all'' abortions are unjustified according to this argument: abortion would be justified if the same justification could be applied to killing an adult human.  . 

Criticism of this line of reasoning follows several threads.  Some reject the argument on grounds relating to [[Personal identity (philosophy)|personal identity]], holding that the fetus is ''not the same entity'' as the adult into which it will develop, and thus that the fetus does not have a "future like ours" in the required sense. <ref>McMahan 2002: ch 1. </ref> Others grant that the fetus has a future like ours, but argue that being deprived of this future is not a significant harm or a significant wrong to the fetus, because there are relatively few ''psychological connections'' (continuations of memory, belief, desire and the like) between the fetus as it is now and the adult into which it will develop. <ref>McMahan 2002: 271; Stretton 2004: 171–179</ref>  Another criticism is that the argument creates inequalities in the wrongness of killing:<ref>Stretton 2004: 250–260; see also McMahan 2002: 234–235 and 271</ref> as the futures of some people appear to be far more valuable or desirable than the futures of other people, the argument appears to entail that some killings are far more ''wrong'' than others, or that some people have a far stronger ''right to life'' than others—a conclusion that is taken to be counterintuitive or unacceptable.  . 

[[Image:March for Women's Lives detail.jpg|thumb|The 2004 [[March for Women's Lives]] near the [[Washington Monument]].]] . 

====Argument from uncertainty====. 
Some pro-life supporters argue that if there is uncertainty as to whether the fetus has a right to life, then having an abortion is equivalent to consciously taking the risk of killing another.  According to this argument, if it is not known for certain whether something (such as the fetus) has a right to life, then it is reckless, and morally wrong, to treat that thing as if it ''lacks'' a right to life (for example by killing it). <ref>Schwarz 1990: 58–9; Beckwith 2007: 60–1; ''Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation'' (1983), by Ronald Reagan, William P. Clark, Brian P. Johnston, Wanda Franz. New Regency Pub, ISBN 0-9641125-3-1</ref>  This would place abortion in the same moral category as [[manslaughter]] (if it turns out that the fetus has a right to life) or certain forms of [[criminal negligence]] (if it turns out that the fetus does not have a right to life). <ref>''Three approaches to abortion'' (2002), by Peter Kreeft, ISBN 0-89870-915-6</ref> . 

David Boonin replies that if this kind of argument were correct, then the killing of nonhuman animals and plants would also be morally wrong, because (Boonin contends) it is not known for certain that such beings lack a right to life. <ref>Boonin 2003: 314–15</ref>  Boonin also argues that arguments from uncertainty fail because the mere fact that one might be mistaken in finding certain arguments persuasive (for example, arguments for the claim that the fetus lacks a right to life) does not mean that one should act contrary to those arguments or assume them to be mistaken. <ref>Boonin 2003: 323</ref> . 

====Religious beliefs====. 
{{Main|Religion and abortion}}
Each faith has many varying views on the moral implications of abortion with each side citing their own textual proof. Oftentimes, these views can be in direct opposition to each other. <ref>[http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Topic-Page-Abortion.html Resources for Religious Views on Abortion on Patheos] {{Dead link|date=June 2011}}</ref> . 

Pro-life Christians support their views with Scripture references such as that of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 1:15; [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 1:4–5; [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 25:21–23; [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 1:18; and [[Psalm]] 139:13–16. [[Catholic Church|The Roman Catholic Church]] believes that human life begins at conception as does the right to life; thus, abortion is considered immoral. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a5.htm |title= Article 5: The Fifth Commandment |accessdate=7 June 2011 |work=Catechism of the Catholic Church| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110514012545/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a5.htm| archivedate= 14 May 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The Church of England also considers abortion to be morally wrong, though their position admits abortion when "the continuance of a pregnancy threatens the life of the mother". <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/christianethics/abortion_1.shtml |title= Abortion: the Church of England view |accessdate=3 August 2009 |work=Religion & Ethics}}</ref> .

A number of opinion polls around the world have explored public opinion regarding the issue of abortion. Results have varied from poll to poll, country to country, and region to region, while varying with regard to different aspects of the issue.  . 

A May 2005 survey examined attitudes toward abortion in 10 European countries, asking respondents whether they agreed with the statement, "If a woman doesn't want children, she should be allowed to have an abortion". The highest level of approval was 81% (in the Czech Republic); the lowest was 47% (in Poland). <ref>TNS Sofres. (May 2005).

In North America, a December 2001 poll surveyed [[Abortion in Canada#Opinion polls|Canadian opinion on abortion]], asking in what circumstances they believe abortion should be permitted; 32% responded that they believe abortion should be legal in all circumstances, 52% that it should be legal in certain circumstances, and 14% that it should be legal in no circumstances. A similar poll in April 2009 surveyed people in the United States about [[Abortion in the United States#Public opinion|U.S. opinion on abortion]]; 18% said that abortion should be "legal in all cases", 28% said that abortion should be "legal in most cases", 28% said abortion should be "illegal in most cases" and 16% said abortion should be "illegal in all cases". <ref>''[http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1212/abortion-gun-control-opinion-gender-gap Pew Research Center]''.

====Effect upon crime rate====. 
{{Main|Legalized abortion and crime effect}} . 

A theory attempts to draw a correlation between the United States' unprecedented nationwide decline of the overall crime rate during the 1990s and the decriminalization of abortion 20 years prior.  . 

The suggestion was brought to widespread attention by a 1999 academic paper, ''[[The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime]]'', authored by the economists [[Steven Levitt|Steven D. Levitt]] and John Donohue. They attributed the drop in crime to a reduction in individuals said to have a higher statistical probability of committing crimes: unwanted children, especially those born to mothers who are African American, impoverished, [[teenage pregnancy|adolescent]], uneducated, and [[single parent|single]]. The change coincided with what would have been the adolescence, or peak years of potential criminality, of those who had not been born as a result of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and similar cases. Donohue and Levitt's study also noted that states which legalized abortion before the rest of the nation experienced the lowering crime rate pattern earlier, and those with higher abortion rates had more pronounced reductions. <ref>{{Cite journal |first=John J. |last=Donohue |date=May 2001|title=[[The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime]] |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=116 |issue=2 |pages=379–420 |doi=10.1162/00335530151144050 |accessdate=2008-12-06 |last2=Levitt |first2=Steven D.}}</ref> . 

Fellow economists Christopher Foote and Christopher Goetz criticized the methodology in the Donohue-Levitt study, noting a lack of accommodation for statewide yearly variations such as cocaine use, and recalculating based on incidence of crime per capita; they found no [[statistically significant]] results. <ref>{{Cite journal |last=Foote |first=Christopher L. |date=February 2008|title=The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime: Comment |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=123 |issue=1 |pages=407–423 |doi=10.1162/qjec.2008.123.1.407 |accessdate=2008-12-06 |last2=Goetz |first2=Christopher F.}}</ref> Levitt and Donohue responded to this by presenting an adjusted [[data set]] which took into account these concerns and reported that the data maintained the statistical significance of their initial paper. <ref>{{Cite journal |last=Donohue |first=John J. |date=February 2008|title=Measurement Error, Legalized Abortion, and the Decline in Crime: A Response to Foote and Goetz |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=123 |issue=1 |pages=425–440 |doi=10.1162/qjec.2008.123.1.425 |accessdate=2008-12-06 |last2=Levitt |first2=Steven D.}}</ref> . 

Such research has been criticized by some as being [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]], discriminatory as to race and socioeconomic class, and as promoting [[eugenics]] as a solution to crime. <ref>{{cite web |title=Crime-Abortion Study Continues to Draw Pro-life Backlash |date=1999-08-11 |publisher=The Pro-Life Infonet |url=http://ohioroundtable.org/library/articles/life/crimeabortion.html |work=Ohio Roundtable Online Library |accessdate=2008-12-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=J.B.F. |url=http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Jan2000/Editorial.asp |title=Abortion and the Lower Crime Rate |date=January 2000|work=St. Anthony Messenger |accessdate=2008-12-06| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081205054847/http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Jan2000/editorial.asp| archivedate= 5 December 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Levitt states in his book ''[[Freakonomics]]'' that they are neither promoting nor negating any course of action—merely reporting data as economists.  . 

====Breast cancer hypothesis====. 
{{Main|Abortion – breast cancer hypothesis}}
The abortion-breast cancer hypothesis posits that induced abortion increases the risk of developing breast cancer. <ref name="RUSSO_505">{{cite journal |author=Russo J, Russo I |title=Susceptibility of the mammary gland to carcinogenesis.

In early pregnancy, levels of [[estrogen]] increase, leading to breast growth in preparation for [[lactation]]. The hypothesis proposes that if this process is interrupted by an abortion&nbsp;– before full maturity in the third trimester&nbsp;– then more relatively vulnerable immature cells could be left than there were prior to the pregnancy, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer. The hypothesis mechanism was first proposed and explored in rat studies conducted in the 1980s. <ref name="RUSSO">{{Cite journal |author=Russo J, Russo IH |title=Susceptibility of the mammary gland to carcinogenesis.

== Exceptions in abortion law ==. 
{{Expand section|date=August 2010}} . 

There are a few common exceptions sometimes found in legal domains where abortion is generally forbidden.  Legal domains which do not have abortion on demand will often allow it when the health of the mother is at stake. "Health of the mother" may mean something different in different areas: for example, the [[Abortion in the Republic of Ireland|Republic of Ireland]] allows abortion only to save the life of the mother, whereas pro-lifers in the United States argue health exceptions are used so broadly as to render a ban essentially meaningless. <ref>http://www.newsweek.com/2008/10/15/health-of-the-mother.html</ref> . 

Laws allowing abortion in cases of rape or incest often go together. For example, before [[Roe v. Wade]], 13 [[U.S. state|US states]] allowed abortion in the case of either rape or incest, but only 1 allowed for it just for rape ([[Mississippi]]), and none for just incest. <ref>http://www.stateline.org/live/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=136&contentId=121780</ref> . 

Also, many countries allow for abortion only through the first or second [[Trimester (pregnancy)|trimester]], and some may allow abortion in cases of fetal defects, e.g., [[Down syndrome]].  .
