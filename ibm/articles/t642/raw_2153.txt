'''''Stenberg v. Carhart''''', [[Case citation|530 U.S. 914]] (2000), is a case heard by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] dealing with a [[Nebraska]] law which made performing [[partial-birth abortion]] illegal, except where necessary to save the life of the mother.  Nebraska [[physician]]s who performed the procedure contrary to the law were subject to having their medical licenses revoked.  Nebraska, like many states, banned the procedure on the basis of public morality.  The Court struck down the law, finding the Nebraska statute criminalizing "partial birth abortion[s]" violated the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]], as interpreted in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' and ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''. This case dealt with pre-viability second [[Pregnancy#Physiology|trimester]] abortions ([[Abortion in the United States|most abortions occur during the first trimester]]).  . 

==History==. 
[[LeRoy Carhart]], a Nebraska physician who specialized in late-term abortions, brought suit against [[Don Stenberg]], the [[Attorney General]] of Nebraska, seeking [[declaratory judgment]] that a state law banning certain forms of [[abortion]] was unconstitutional, based on the undue burden test mentioned by a dissenting opinion in ''Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health''<ref>''Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?navby=case&court=us&vol=462&invol=416  462 U.S. 416] (1983). </ref> and by the Court in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]''. Both a [[United States district court|federal district court]] and the [[United States court of appeals|U.S. Court of Appeals]] ruled in favor of Carhart before the case was appealed to the Supreme Court.  . 

The Nebraska statute prohibited "partial birth abortion", which it defined as any abortion in which the physician "partially delivers vaginally a living unborn child before killing the unborn child and completing the delivery."  The most common type of abortion performed is [[suction-aspiration abortion]] which consists of a vacuum tube inserted into the [[uterus]]; others consist of what is known as "D&E" ([[dilation and evacuation]]), which is usually used during the second trimester because of the increased amount of fetal material. The procedure dilates the [[cervix]] and removes some fetal material with non-vacuum instruments, and, in some cases, uses curettage inside the uterus so that fetal material can be evacuated. Dr. Carhart wanted to use a modified version of this called "D&X" ([[Intact dilation and extraction|Dilation and Extraction]]), which, rather than commencing curettage inside the uterus, extracts part of the fetus first and then begins the process of dismemberment. Carhart stated that he wanted to perform this procedure because he believed it would be safer and would involve fewer risks for the women; it lowered the risk of leaving potentially harmful fetal tissue in the uterus, and it minimized the number of instruments physicians needed to use.  . 

Experts in fetal development provide markedly different assessments of the kind and degree of pain (if any) experienced by the fetus (''see [[Fetal pain]]''). Although in the second and third trimesters the [[nervous system]] is largely in place, the level of consciousness or awareness of the fetus is a matter of conjecture. Experiments aimed at measuring fetal pain have yielded results that are somewhat open to interpretation, given that measurable reactions of the fetus to stimuli may not correspond directly to an adult experience of pain. Many medical authorities affirm that at the stage of pregnancy when this procedure is performed, the fetus has not reached what the medical community has defined as [[Viability (fetal)|viability]], the stage at which a  developing fetus can be expected to live if removed from the uterus (usually at five months gestation, with medical assistance, although the viability threshold is retreating with medical advances).  . 

The medical and scientific questions surrounding partial-birth abortion are impacted in the public arena by political and special interest considerations, resulting in a certain degree of media "hype" surrounding this case. Proponents of abortion rights on the one hand and the right-to-life on the other both decry what they describe as "myths" regarding this procedure that have passed into mainstream American debate on the issue.  . 

==The U.S. Supreme Court Ruling==. 
The case was argued in 2000, and several issues were brought up during the oral arguments.  The first was the lack of an exception for the woman's health.  The state of Nebraska took the position that D&X abortions were never medically necessary, meaning that an exception was not needed.  Secondly, it was inquired on whether or not the law could be construed to apply to other forms of abortion, in which case it would violate the "right to privacy" interpreted from the Constitution, as described in the ''Roe'' and ''Casey'' decisions.  The law had never been certified to the Supreme Court of Nebraska, as it had been challenged two days after the law was passed.  . 

===Opinion of the court and concurring opinions===. 
Justice [[Stephen Breyer]], in writing the opinion of the Court, cited ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' and said that any abortion law that imposed an undue burden on a woman's "right to choose" (abortion) was unconstitutional.  He said that causing those who procure abortions to "fear prosecution, conviction, and imprisonment" was an undue burden, and therefore declared the law to be against the Constitution.  Justices [[John Paul Stevens]], [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], [[David Souter]], and [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] all agreed that the law was unconstitutional, but Ginsburg wrote a separate opinion, as did O'Connor.  Ginsburg stated plainly that a state could not force physicians to use procedures other than what they felt in their own judgment to be the safest, that this was part of the "life and liberty" protected under the Constitution.  O'Connor agreed, saying that any such procedural law would have to be applied only to prevent unnecessary partial-birth abortions, and would have to include an exception for the health of the woman (as this law did not).  Justices Stevens also filed a separate opinion. He noted that government had no right to force doctors to perform any procedure other than what they felt would be the safest.  . 

===Dissents===. 
Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] dissented.  Kennedy claimed this type of law was allowed by their ruling in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', which allowed laws to preserve prenatal life to a certain extent.  He called [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]'s behavior a "repudiation" of the understandings and assurances given in ''Casey''.  Justice Kennedy also detailed what he deemed a constitutionally protected alternative to partial-birth abortion.  . 

This was a far cry from Justice [[Clarence Thomas]]' dissent, which stated that abortion was not a right contained in the Constitution, and sharply criticized the majority and concurring opinions.  Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]], along with [[Antonin Scalia]], and Thomas have consistently said that they do not believe abortion is a protected right, and have pointed out that "privacy" is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution.  Thomas also pointed out in his dissenting opinion that even if abortion was a woman's right, the law in question was not designed to strike at the right itself.  He reminded the others that many groups, including even the [[American Medical Association]], had concluded that partial-birth abortion was very different from other forms of abortion, and was often considered [[infanticide]].  Thomas further noted that the gruesome nature of some partial-birth abortions has caused personal trauma in the doctors performing them.  In a short separate opinion, Chief Justice Rehnquist stated that he did not join ''Casey'' but felt that Justice Kennedy had applied its precedent correctly, and thus joined his opinion.  . 

In his dissent, Justice Scalia recalled his prior dissent in ''Casey'' in which he had criticized the undue burden standard as "doubtful in application as it is unprincipled in origin."  What constitutes an undue burden is a value judgment, argued Scalia; it should therefore be no surprise that the Court split on whether the Nebraska statute constitutes an undue burden.  Scalia moreover chastised Kennedy for feeling betrayed by the majority.  Scalia declared that the ''Stenberg'' decision was not "a regrettable misapplication of ''Casey'',"&mdash;as Kennedy claimed&mdash;but "''Casey'''s logical and entirely predictable consequence."  Denouncing the undue burden standard of ''Casey'' as illegitimate, Scalia called for ''Casey'' to be overruled.  . 

==Effects of the Decision== . 

By a 5-4 majority, the Nebraska law was struck down, as were all other state laws banning partial-birth abortion.  In 2003, however, the federal government enacted a [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]]. This law did not include an exception for the health of the woman, as Justice O'Connor said it must.  Congress inserted findings into the law saying that the procedure is never needed to protect maternal health.  Although several federal judges struck down this federal law, citing the precedent of ''Stenberg v. Carhart'', it was eventually upheld by the Supreme Court in ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]].'' . 

The Supreme Court case of ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'' concerns similar questions as those in ''Stenberg'', but this time in the context of a federal statute.  The decision in Gonzales v. Carhart has narrowed the holding in this case.  .
