In 1990, the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) found that "severe negative reactions [after abortion] are rare and are in line with those following other normal life stresses."<ref name="moreonkoop"/> The APA revised and updated its findings in August 2008 to account for the accumulation of new evidence, and again concluded that termination of a first, [[unplanned pregnancy]] did not lead to an increased risk of mental health problems.

==Current and historical reviews==. 
[[Systematic review]]s of the scientific literature have concluded that that there are no difference in the long-term mental health of women who obtain induced abortions as compared to women in appropriate control groups. <ref name="charles-2008"/> While some studies have reported a [[statistical correlation]] between abortion and clinical depression, anxiety, suicidal behaviors, or adverse effects on women's sexual functions for a small number of women, these studies are typically methodologically flawed and fail to account for [[confounder|confounding factors]]. Higher-quality studies have consistently found no causal relationship between abortion and mental-health problems. <ref name="charles-2008"/> The correlations observed in some studies may be explained by pre-existing social circumstances and emotional health. <ref>{{cite news | publisher = ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903771-1,00.html | title = Abortion on Demand | date = 1973-01-29 | accessdate = 2008-11-18}}</ref> Various factors, such as emotional attachment to the pregnancy, lack of support, and conservative views on abortion, may increase the likelihood of experiencing negative reactions.  . 

===United States Surgeon General (late 1980s)===. 
In 1987, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] directed [[Surgeon General of the United States|U.S. Surgeon General]] [[C. Everett Koop]], an [[evangelical Christian]] and abortion opponent,<ref name="nlm">{{cite web | url = http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Narrative/QQ/p-nid/88 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/60GpKCVAq | archivedate = June 18, 2011 | title = The C. Everett Koop Papers: Reproduction and Family Health | publisher = [[National Library of Medicine]] | accessdate = June 18, 2011}}</ref> to issue a report on the health effects of abortion. Reportedly, the idea for the review was conceived by Reagan advisors [[Dinesh D'Souza]] and [[Gary Bauer]] as a means of "rejuvenat[ing]" the pro-life movement by producing evidence of the risks of abortion. <ref name="washingtonmonthly">{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0410.mooney2.html | title = Bucking the Gipper | last = Mooney | first = Chris | authorlink = Chris Mooney | publisher = ''[[Washington Monthly]]'' | date = October 2004 | accessdate = 2008-02-18}}</ref> Koop was reluctant to accept the assignment, believing that Reagan was more concerned with appeasing his political base than with improving women's health. <ref name="nlm"/> . 

Ultimately, Koop reviewed over 250 studies pertaining to the psychological impact of abortion. Koop wrote in a letter to Reagan that "scientific studies do not provide conclusive data about the health effects of abortion on women."<ref name="times1-11-89">{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE2DC143DF932A25752C0A96F948260 | title = Koop's Stand on Abortion's Effect Surprises Friends and Foes Alike | last = Tolchin | first = Martin | publisher = ''[[New York Times]]'' | date = 1989-01-11 | accessdate = 2008-02-18}}</ref> Koop acknowledged the political context of the question in his letter, writing: "In the minds of some of [Reagan's advisors], it was a foregone conclusion that the negative health effects of abortion on women were so overwhelming that the evidence would force the reversal of ''Roe vs. Wade''."<ref name="times3-17-89"/> . 

In later testimony before the [[United States Congress]], Koop stated that the quality of existing evidence was too poor to prepare a report "that could withstand scientific and statistical scrutiny." Koop noted that "...&nbsp;there is no doubt about the fact that some people have severe psychological effects after abortion, but anecdotes do not make good scientific material."<ref name="times3-17-89">{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEEDF1F3CF934A25750C0A96F948260 | title = Koop Says Abortion Report Couldn't Survive Challenge | last = Leary | first = Warren | publisher = ''[[New York Times]]'' | date = 1989-03-17| accessdate = 2008-02-18}}</ref> In his congressional testimony, Koop stated that while psychological responses to abortion may be "overwhelming" in individual cases, the psychological risks of abortion were "miniscule from a public health perspective."<ref name="Bazelon"/><ref name="newscientist">{{cite news | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12416951.000-reagans-officials-suppressed-research-on-abortion-.html | title = Reagan's officials 'suppressed' research on abortion | last = Joyce | first = Christopher | publisher = ''[[New Scientist]]'' | date = 1989-12-16| accessdate = 2008-02-18| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080314235047/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12416951.000-reagans-officials-suppressed-research-on-abortion-.html| archivedate= 14 March 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name="APA89"/><ref name="washingtonmonthly"/> . 

Subsequently, a Congressional committee charged that Koop refused to publish the results of his review because he failed to find evidence that abortion was harmful, and that Koop watered down his findings in his letter to Reagan by claiming that the studies were inconclusive. Congressman [[Theodore S. Weiss]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[New York|NY]]), who oversaw the investigation, argued that when Koop found no evidence that abortion was harmful, he "decided not to issue a report, but instead to write a letter to the president which would be sufficiently vague as to avoid supporting the pro-choice position that abortion is safe for women."<ref name="newscientist"/> . 

===American Psychological Association (1990, 2008)===. 
The [[American Psychological Association]] prepared a literature summary and recommendations for Koop's report. After Koop refused to issue their findings, the APA panel published them in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', concluding that "Although there may be sensations of regret, sadness, or guilt, the weight of the evidence from scientific studies indicates that legal abortion of an unwanted pregnancy in the first trimester does not pose a psychological hazard for most women."<ref name="APA89"/> The panel also noted that "...women who are terminating pregnancies that are wanted and personally meaningful, who lack support from their partner or parents for the abortion, or who have more conflicting feelings or are less sure of their decision before hand may be a relatively higher risk for negative consequences."<ref name="APA89"/> . 

The APA task force also concluded that "research with diverse samples, different measures of response, and different times of assessment have come to similar conclusions. The time of greatest distress is likely to be before the abortion. Severe negative reactions after abortions are rare and can best be understood in the framework of coping with normal life stress."<ref name="APA89"/> Nancy Adler, professor of psychology at the [[University of California, San Francisco]], has testified on behalf of the APA that "severe negative reactions are rare and are in line with those following other normal life stresses."<ref name="moreonkoop"/><ref>{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEEDE133FF935A35757C0A966958260 | title= Study Finds Little Lasting Distress From Abortion | publisher = ''[[New York Times]]'' | date = 1990-04-06| accessdate = 2008-11-18| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081205231237/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEEDE133FF935A35757C0A966958260| archivedate= 5 December 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> . 

In 2007, APA established a new task force to review studies on abortion published since 1989. <ref name="Bazelon"/> The APA task force issued an updated summary of medical evidence in August 2008, again concluding that a single first-trimester abortion carried no more mental health risk than carrying a pregnancy to term. The panel noted a lack of quality data on the effect of multiple abortions. Additionally, the same factors which predispose a woman to multiple unwanted pregnancies may also predipose her to mental health difficulties; therefore, they declined to draw a firm conclusion on multiple abortions. <ref name="apa-2008">{{cite web | url = http://www.apa.org/releases/abortion-report.pdf APA | title = Task Force on Mental Health and Abortion | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] | accessdate = 2008-08-28}}</ref><ref name="nyt-aug-2008"/> . 

===Royal College of Psychiatrists (2008)===. 
On March 14, 2008, the [[United Kingdom]] [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] released a statement saying that "The specific issue of whether or not induced abortion has harmful effects on women’s mental health remains to be fully resolved. The current research evidence base is inconclusive—some studies indicate no evidence of harm, whilst other studies identify a range of mental disorders following abortion." The statement noted that the Royal College is undertaking a [[systematic review]] of the medical literature with the intent of updating its position and possibly recommending changes to the [[informed consent]] process for abortion. The final report is expected in autumn 2011. <ref name="rcpsych2008">{{cite web | url = http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/members/nccmh/consultations.aspx | title = Position Statement on Women’s Mental Health in Relation to Induced Abortion | publisher = [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] | date = 2008-03-14| accessdate= 2008-11-20}}</ref> . 

The Royal College's statement was interpreted variously by the media. ''[[The Times]]'' wrote that "women may be at risk of mental health breakdowns if they have abortions" and that "women should not be allowed to have an abortion until they are counselled on the possible risk to their mental health."<ref name="RCP1">{{cite news | last = Templeton | first = Sarah-Kate | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article3559486.ece |title = Royal college warns abortions can lead to mental illness | publisher = ''[[The Times]]'' | date = 2008-03-16| accessdate = 2008-03-18 | location=London}}</ref> In contrast, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' reported that "Updated guidance from the Royal College of Physicians points out that there is still no evidence that abortion causes mental health problems... The college rejects claims by the pro-life lobby that abortion causes mental health problems."<ref name="dailymail">{{cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=535908&in_page_id=1770 |title = Woman 'should have abortions blocked' until mental illness risks are known | last = Martin | first = Daniel | publisher = ''[[Daily Mail]]'' | date = 2008-03-16 | accessdate = 2008-03-18}}</ref> The ''Daily Mail'' also noted that the Royal College of Psychiatrists report came out at a time when there was a controversial proposal before [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] to reduce the term limit for abortions from 24 weeks to 20 weeks. <ref name="dailymail"/> . 

===Johns Hopkins (2008)===. 
In 2008, a team at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore]] concluded, in a [[systematic review]] of the medical literature, that "the best quality studies indicate no significant differences in long-term mental health between women in the United States who choose to terminate a pregnancy and those who do not."<ref name="charles-2008"/><ref name=jhu>{{cite news | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28050494/from/ET/ | title = Abortion not seen linked with depression | quote = Review of studies found no evidence of emotional harm after procedure | publisher = [[MSNBC]] | date = December 4, 2008}}</ref> Dr. Robert Blum, the senior author on the study, stated: "The best research does not support the existence of a 'post-abortion syndrome' similar to post-traumatic stress disorder." The researchers further reported that "... studies with the most flawed methodology consistently found negative mental health consequences of abortion," and wrote: "Scientists are still conducting research to answer politically motivated questions." . 

===National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health (2011)===. 
A [[systematic review]] for [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)]] conducted by the [[National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health]] found that abortion "did not raise" mental health risks. The review found that rates of common disorders were higher in women with unwanted pregnancies, but abortion did not alter that. <ref name="NCCMHBBC">{{cite news | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-16094906 |title = Abortion 'does not raise' mental health risk | last = Dreaper | first = Jane | publisher = ''[[BBC News]]'' | date = 2011-12-09 | accessdate = 2011-12-09}}</ref> . 

==Post-abortion syndrome==. 
The term "post-abortion syndrome" was first used in 1981 by Vincent Rue, a [[pro-life movement|pro-life advocate]], in testimony before [[United States Congress|Congress]] in which he stated that he had observed [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] which developed in response to the stress of abortion. Rue proposed the name "post-abortion syndrome" (PAS) to describe this phenomenon. <ref>Vincent Rue, "Abortion and Family Relations," testimony before the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the US Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, 97th Congress, Washington, DC (1981). </ref><ref>{{cite journal | journal = J Soc Issues | author = Speckhard A, Rue V | title = Postabortion Syndrome: An Emerging Public Health Concern | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | year = 1992 | pages = 95–119 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-4560.1992.tb00899.x}}</ref> . 

The term post-abortion syndrome (PAS) has subsequently been popularized and widely used by pro-life advocates to describe a broad range of adverse emotional reactions which they attribute to abortion. <ref name="Bazelon"/><ref name="Mooney"/><ref name="BostonG">{{cite news | url = http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2005/07/31/science_in_support_of_a_cause_the_new_research/?rss_id=Boston+Globe+--+National+News | title = Science in support of a cause: the new research | last = Kranish | first = Michael | publisher = ''[[Boston Globe]]'' | date = 2005-07-31 | accessdate= 2007-11-27}}</ref> "Post-abortion syndrome" has not found widespread acceptance outside the pro-life community; the [[American Psychological Association]] and the [[American Psychiatric Association]] do not recognize PAS as an actual diagnosis or condition, and it is not included in the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' [[DSM-IV-TR]] or in the [[ICD|ICD-10]] list of psychiatric conditions. Some [[physician]]s and [[pro-choice|pro-choice advocates]] have argued that the focus on "post-abortion syndrome" is a tactic used by pro-life advocates for political purposes. <ref name="stotlandreview"/><ref name="stotland_1404747"/><ref>{{cite news | last = Cooper | first = Cynthia |url = http://www.msmagazine.com/aug01/pas.html | title = Abortion Under Attack | publisher = ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' | date = August/September 2001 | accessdate = 2008-11-18}}</ref><ref name="JSoc2">{{cite journal |author=Russo NF, Denious JE |title=Controlling birth: science, politics, and public policy |journal=J Soc Issues |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=181–91 |year=2005 |pmid=17073030 |doi=10.1111/j.0022-4537.2005.00400.x}}</ref> . 

==Men==. 
The psychological response of male partners to abortion has been the subject of limited research. A study of 75 men in [[Sweden]] found that most participating men agreed with their partner's decision to have an abortion, and that many experienced a complex mix of emotions including anxiety, responsibility, guilt, relief and grief. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Kero A, Lalos A, Högberg U, Jacobsson L |title=The male partner involved in legal abortion |journal=Hum.
