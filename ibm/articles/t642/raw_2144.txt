'''Neonatal perception''' is the study of the extent of [[somatosensory]] and other [[perceptual system]]s during [[pregnancy]]. In practical terms, this means the study of [[fetus]]es; none of the accepted indicators of perception are present in [[embryo]]s.  . 

==Medical studies and reviews==. 
The hypothesis that human fetuses are capable of perceiving [[pain]] in the early stages of a pregnancy has not received sufficient evidence to be proven or disproven; the developmental stage of research and instrumentation is so far insufficient to this task. The issue is considerably complicated by the usual difficulties in perceptual research of unresponsive subjects: "Though techniques such as positron electron tomography scanning might reveal those parts of the brain that respond to a painful stimulus, this does not tell us what the individual is experiencing."<ref>{{cite book | title = Pain in neonates  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=QZNqksG_lJEC&pg=PP1&dq=%22Pain+in+neonates%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&as_brr=0#v=onepage&q=&f=false | author = K. J. S. Anand | coauthors = Patrick J. McGrath, Bonnie J. Stevens | publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences}}</ref> . 

The accepted hypothesis of the means by which pain is perceived states that it requires certain physical structures and operations. These are not formed in fetuses until 30 weeks or more. The consensus of the scientific community at this time is that only fetuses of this age or older are capable of perceiving pain.  . 

Researchers from the [[University of California, San Francisco]] in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' concluded in a [[meta-analysis]] of data from dozens of medical reports and studies that [[fetuses]] are unlikely to feel [[pain]] until the [[third trimester]] of pregnancy. <ref name="Lee">{{cite journal |author=Lee SJ, Ralston HJ, Drey EA, Partridge JC, Rosen MA |title=Fetal pain: a systematic multidisciplinary review of the evidence |journal=JAMA |volume=294 |issue=8 |pages=947–54 |year=2005 |url=http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/local/scisoc/brownbag/brownbag0506/fetalpain.pdf|pmid=16118385 |doi=10.1001/jama.294.8.947}}</ref><ref name = APviaMSNBC>{{cite web | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9053416/ | title = Study: Fetus feels no pain until third trimester | author = AP | publisher = MSNBC | date = 24 Aug 05}}</ref> There is an emerging consensus among developmental [[neurobiology|neurobiologists]] that the establishment of [[Human thalamus|thalamocortical]] connections (at about 26 weeks) is a critical event with regard to fetal perception of pain. <ref>Johnson, Martin and Everitt, Barry.

Electroencephalography suggests the capacity for functional pain perception in premature infants probably does not exist before 29 or 30 weeks; this study asserted that withdrawal reflexes and changes in heart rates and hormone levels in response to invasive procedures are reflexes that do not indicate fetal pain. <ref name="Lee"/> . 

Also in 2005, Mellor and colleagues reviewed several lines of evidence that suggested a fetus does not awaken during its time in the womb.  Mellor notes that much of the literature on fetal pain simply extrapolates from findings and research on premature babies. He questions the value of such data: <blockquote>Systematic studies of fetal neurological function suggest, however, that there are major differences in the in utero environment and fetal neural state that make it likely that this assumption is substantially incorrect. </blockquote> He and his team detected the presence of such chemicals as [[adenosine]], [[pregnanolone]], and [[prostaglandin]]-D<sub>2</sub> in both human and animal fetuses, indicating that the fetus is both sedated and anesthetized in the womb. These chemicals are oxidized with the newborn's first few breaths and washed out of the tissues, allowing consciousness to occur. If the fetus is asleep throughout gestation then the possibility of fetal pain is greatly minimized. <ref name="Diesch">Mellor D.J., Diesch T.J., Gunn A.J., & Bennet L. (2005).

There is also discussion among researchers about how pain is perceived over-all.  Some researchers believe that because pain can involve sensory, emotional and cognitive factors, pain may not be sensed until after birth. <ref name="Johnson">Johnson, Martin and Everitt, Barry.

==Fetal pain and abortion==. 
Scientific research generally indicates that the fetus is incapable of feeling pain until at least the 24th week. <ref>{{cite web|last=Susan J. Lee, JD;    Henry J. Peter Ralston, MD;     Eleanor A. Drey, MD, EdM;     John Colin Partridge, MD, MPH;     Mark A. Rosen, MD|title=Fetal Pain. A Systematic Multidisciplinary Review of the Evidence|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/294/8/947.short|work=JAMA.|publisher=jama|accessdate=23 March 2012}}</ref>  Many pro-life activists strongly believe in the ability of a fetus to perceive pain, and have introduced legislation in line with this belief. However, fetal pain is not a major legal issue in the debate about [[abortion]], and has not been a deciding factor in any [[US Supreme Court]] decision, including the 1973 ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''.  . 

Such legislation, if passed would likely affect a very small percentage of [[abortion]]s, as most are performed before week 20.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} . 

===Medical objections=== . 

Medical objections to fetal pain legislation has been raised on a number of grounds. Some caution that unnecessary use of fetal anesthetic may pose potential health risks to the prospective mother. <blockquote>In the context of abortion, fetal analgesia would be used solely for beneficence toward the fetus, assuming fetal pain exists. This interest must be considered in concert with maternal safety and fetal effectiveness of any proposed anesthetic or analgesic technique. For instance, general anesthesia increases abortion morbidity and mortality for women and substantially increases the cost of abortion. Although placental transfer of many opioids and sedative-hypnotics has been
determined, the maternal dose required for fetal analgesia is unknown, as is the safety for women at such doses. 
<ref name="Lee"/></blockquote> . 

In any event, anesthesia may be unnecessary, as the fetal brain is awash in naturally occurring chemicals that keep it sedated and anesthetized until birth. <ref name="Diesch"/> . 

Anesthesia researcher, Laura Myers, has suggested the fetal pain legislation may make abortions harder to obtain; because, abortion clinics lack the equipment and expertise to supply fetal anesthesia. Currently, anesthesia is administered directly to fetuses only while they are undergoing surgery. <ref name="paul">Paul, Annie.

===United Kingdom===. 
In March 2010, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists submitted a [http://www.rcog.org.uk/fetal-awareness-review-research-and-recommendations-practice  report], ''Fetal Awareness - Review of Research and Recommendations for Practice'', concluding that "Current research shows that the sensory structures are not developed or specialized enough to respond to pain in a fetus of less than 24 weeks", pg. 22. <blockquote>The neural regions and pathways that are responsible for pain experience remain under debate but it is generally accepted that pain from physical trauma requires an intact pathway from the periphery, through the spinal cord, into the thalamus and on to regions of the cerebral cortex including the primary sensory cortex (S1), the insular cortex and the anterior cingulated cortex.3,4 Fetal pain is not possible before these necessary neural pathways and structures (figure 1) have developed. -pg. 3</blockquote> The report specifically identified the [[anterior cingulate]] as the area of the cerebral cortex responsible for pain processing. The [[anterior cingulate]] is part of the [[cerebral cortex]], which begins to develop in the fetus at week 26.  . 

In 2006, an opinion piece by Stuart Derbyshire in the ''British Medical Journal'' concluded that pain is dependent upon cognitive and emotional developments that occur after birth: . 

{{quote|Theories of development assume that the early human mind begins with minimal content and gradually evolves into the rich experience of older children and adults. Although the view of a neonate as a blank slate, or ''tabula rasa'', is generally rejected, it is broadly accepted that psychological processes have content concerning people, objects, and symbols, which lay in the first instance outside the brain. If pain also depends on content derived from outside the brain, then fetal pain cannot be possible, regardless of neural development. <ref name="Derby">Derbyshire, S.W.G. (2006).
