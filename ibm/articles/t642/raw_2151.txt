'''''Roe v. Wade''''', {{ussc|410|113|1973}}, is a [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark]] decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] on the issue of [[abortion]]. Decided simultaneously with companion case ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', the Court ruled that a right to [[Privacy#Privacy law|privacy]] under the [[due process]] clause in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] extends to a woman's decision to have an abortion, but that right must be balanced against the state's two legitimate interests for regulating abortions: protecting prenatal life and protecting the woman's health. Saying that these state interests become stronger over the course of a pregnancy, the Court resolved this [[balancing test]] by tying state regulation of abortion to the woman's current [[Trimester (pregnancy)#Physiology|trimester of pregnancy]].  . 

The Court later rejected ''Roe''{{'}}s trimester framework, while affirming ''Roe''{{'}}s central holding that a person has a right to abortion until [[viability (fetal)|viability]]. <ref>"[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/clinic/wars/cases.html Roe v. Wade and Beyond]", [[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]], [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] (2006-01-19): "while reaffirming the central holding of Roe v.

Wade'' prompted a [[abortion debate|national debate]] that continues today, about issues including whether and to what extent abortion should be legal, who should decide the legality of abortion, what methods the Supreme Court should use in constitutional [[adjudication]], and what the role should be of [[religion|religious]] and [[morality|moral]] views in the political sphere. ''Roe v. Wade'' reshaped national politics, dividing much of the United States into [[pro-choice]] and [[pro-life]] camps, while activating [[grassroots]] movements on both sides.  . 

==Background==. 
===History of abortion laws in the United States===. 
According to the Court, "the restrictive criminal abortion laws in effect in a majority of States today are of relatively recent vintage." In 1821, Connecticut passed the first state statute criminalizing abortion. Every state had abortion legislation by 1900. <ref>Cole, George; Frankowski, Stanislaw. [http://books.google.com/books?id=-ujuOMTNAQAC&pg=PA20 Abortion and protection of the human fetus : legal problems in a cross-cultural perspective]'', page 20 (1987): "By 1900 every state in the Union had an anti-abortion prohibition."

Retrieved (2008-04-08). </ref> [[Abortion in the United States|In the United States, abortion]] was sometimes considered a [[common law]] crime,<ref>[[James Wilson|Wilson, James]], "[http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=831 Of the Natural Rights of Individuals]" (1790–1792): "In the contemplation of law, life begins when the infant is first able to stir in the womb." Also see [[William Blackstone|Blackstone, William]]. [http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendIXs1.html Commentaries] (1765): "Life ... begins in contemplation of law as soon as an infant is able to stir in the mother's womb."</ref> though Justice [[Harry Blackmun|Blackmun]] would conclude that the criminalization of abortion did not have "roots in the English common-law tradition."<ref>{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|p=92}}</ref> . 

=== Prior history of the case ===. 
In June 1969, [[Norma McCorvey|Norma L. McCorvey]] discovered she was pregnant with her third child. She returned to [[Dallas]], where friends advised her to assert falsely that she had been raped, as she could then obtain a legal abortion (with the understanding that [[Texas]]' anti-abortion laws allowed abortion in the cases of rape and incest). However, this scheme failed, as there was no police report documenting the alleged rape. She attempted to obtain an illegal abortion, but found the unauthorized site shuttered, closed down by the police. Eventually, she was referred to attorneys [[Linda Coffee]] and [[Sarah Weddington]]. <ref>McCorvey, Norma and Meisler, Andy. ''I Am Roe: My Life, Roe V. Wade, and Freedom of Choice'' (Harper Collins 1994). </ref> (McCorvey would give birth before the case was decided.) . 

In 1970, attorneys Linda Coffee and Sarah Weddington filed suit in a U.S. District Court in Texas on behalf of Norma L. McCorvey (under the alias [[John Doe|Jane Roe]]). The defendant in the case was [[Dallas County District Attorney]] [[Henry Wade]], representing the State of Texas. At the time, McCorvey was no longer claiming her pregnancy was the result of rape, and later acknowledged she had lied earlier about having been raped. <ref>[[Richard Ostling]]. [http://www.texnews.com/1998/texas/roe1019.html "A second religious conversion for 'Jane Roe' of Roe vs. Wade"], ''Associated Press'' (1998-10-19): "She confessed that her tale of rape a decade before had been a lie; she was simply an unwed mother who later gave the child up for adoption.". </ref><ref name="testimony">McCorvey, Norma.

The district court ruled in McCorvey's favor on the [[Merit (legal)|merits]], and declined to grant an [[injunction]] against the enforcement of the laws barring abortion. <ref name="dist" /> The district court's decision was based upon the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]], and the court relied upon a concurring opinion by Justice [[Arthur Goldberg]] in the 1965 Supreme Court case of ''[[Griswold v.

== Before the Supreme Court ==. 
''Roe v. Wade'' reached the Supreme Court on appeal in 1970. The Justices delayed taking action on ''Roe'' and a closely related case, ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', until they decided ''[[Younger v. Harris]]'', as they felt that the appeals raised difficult questions on judicial jurisdiction, and ''[[United States v. Vuitch]]'', where they considered the constitutionality of a [[Washington D.C.|District of Columbia]] statute that criminalized abortion except where the mother's life or health was endangered. In ''Vuitch'', the Court narrowly upheld the statute, though in doing so, it treated abortion as a medical procedure and stated that the physician must be given room to determine what suffices as a danger to (physical or mental) health. The day after they announced their decision in ''Vuitch'', they voted to hear both ''Roe'' and ''Doe''. <ref>{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|pp=77–79}}</ref> . 

Arguments were scheduled by the full Court for December 13, 1971. Before the Court could hear the oral arguments, Justices [[Hugo Black|Black]] and [[John Marshall Harlan II|Harlan]] retired. [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court|Chief Justice]] [[Warren Burger|Burger]] asked Justices [[Potter Stewart|Stewart]] and Blackmun to determine whether ''Roe'' and ''Doe'', among others, should be heard as scheduled. According to Blackmun, Stewart felt that the cases were a straightforward application of ''Younger v. Harris'' and recommended that the Court move forward as scheduled. <ref>{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|p=80}}</ref> . 

Following a first round of arguments, all seven Justices tentatively agreed that the law should be struck down, but for varying reasons. <ref>{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|p=81}}</ref> Burger assigned the role of writing the Court's opinion in ''Roe'' (as well as ''Doe'') to Blackmun, who began drafting a preliminary opinion that emphasized what he saw as the Texas law's vagueness. <ref>{{harvnb|Schwartz|1988|p=103}}</ref> Justices [[William Rehnquist|Rehnquist]] and [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.|Powell]] joined the Supreme Court too late to hear the first round of arguments. Additionally, Blackmun felt that his opinion was an inadequate reflection of his liberal colleagues' opinions. <ref>{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|pp=81–88}}</ref> In May 1972, Blackmun proposed that the case be reargued. Justice [[William O. Douglas|Douglas]] threatened to write a dissent from the reargument order (he and the other liberal Justices were suspicious that Rhenquist and Powell would vote to uphold the statute), but was coaxed out of the action by his colleagues, and his dissent was merely mentioned in the reargument order without further statement or opinion. <ref>{{harvnb|Garrow|1994|p=556}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|p=89}}</ref> The case was reargued on October 11, 1972. Weddington continued to represent ''Roe'', and Texas Assistant Attorney General [[Robert C. Flowers]] stepped in to replace Wade.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} . 

Blackmun continued work on his opinions in both cases over the summer recess, despite the fact that there was no guarantee that he would be assigned to write the opinions again. Over the recess, Blackmun spent a week researching the history of abortion at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in Minnesota, where he had worked in the 1950s. After the Court heard the second round of arguments, Powell stated that he would agree with Blackmun's conclusion but pushed for ''Roe'' to be the lead of the two abortions cases being considered. Powell also suggested that the Court strike down the Texas law on privacy grounds. White was unwilling to sign on to Blackmun's opinion, and Rehnquist had already decided to dissent. <ref>{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|pp=93–95}}</ref> . 

== Supreme Court decision ==. 
[[File:US Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, detail.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Harry Blackmun]] wrote the Court’s opinion.]]
The Court issued its decision on January 22, 1973, with a 7-to-2 majority vote in favor of Roe. Burger and Douglas' concurring opinions and White's dissenting opinion were issued with along with the Court's opinion in ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'' (announced on the same day as ''Roe v. Wade''). The Court deemed abortion a [[fundamental right]] under the [[United States Constitution]], thereby subjecting all laws attempting to restrict it to the standard of [[strict scrutiny]]. <ref>Although abortion is still considered a fundamental right under current jurisprudence, [[#Role in subsequent decisions and politics|subsequent cases]], notably ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'', and ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'' have affected the legal standard. </ref> . 

=== Right to privacy ===. 
The Court declined to adopt the district court's [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] rationale, and instead asserted that the "right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the district court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy."<ref>Chase, H. et al. ''Supplement to Edward S. Corwin's The constitution and what it means today: Supreme Court decisions of 1973, 1974, and 1975'', page 36 (Princeton University Press 1975): "The abortion cases afforded the Supreme Court another opportunity to caress the Ninth Amendment without embracing it."</ref> Douglas in his concurring opinion in the companion case ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', stated more emphatically that, "The Ninth Amendment obviously does not create federally enforceable rights."<ref>Devins, Neal and Watson, Wendy. ''Judicial Nominations'', page 225 (1995). </ref> . 

The Court asserted that that the government had two competing interests – protecting the mother's health and protecting the "potentiality of human life". Following its earlier logic, the Court stated that during the first trimester, when the procedure is [[Abortion#Safety|more safe than childbirth]], the decision to abort must be left to the mother and her physician. The State has the right to intervene prior to [[fetal viability]] only to protect the health of the mother, and may regulate the procedure after viability so long as there is always an exception for preserving maternal health. The Court additionally added that the primary right being preserved in the ''Roe'' decision was that of the physician's right to practice medicine freely absent a compelling state interest – not women's rights in general. <ref>{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|pp=98–99}}</ref> The Court explicitly rejected a fetal "right to life" argument. <ref>{{cite court|litigants=Roe v. Wade|vol=410|reporter=U.S.|opinion=113|pinpoint=Section IX|court=S.

The Justices had discussed the trimester framework extensively. Powell had suggested that the point where the state could intervene be placed at [[fetal viability|viability]], which [[Thurgood Marshall|Marshall]] supported as well. <ref>{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|pp=96–97}}</ref> Blackmun wrote of the majority decision he authored: "You will observe that I have concluded that the end of the first trimester is critical. This is arbitrary, but perhaps any other selected point, such as [[quickening]] or viability, is equally arbitrary."<ref>Woodward, Bob.

Retrieved 2007-01-23. </ref> Brennan proposed abandoning frameworks based on the age of the fetus and instead allowing states to regulate the procedure based on its safety for the mother. <ref name="Greenhouse 97" /> . 

=== Justiciability ===. 
An aspect of the decision that attracted comparatively little attention was the Court's disposition of the issues of [[Standing (law)|standing]] and [[mootness]]. Under the traditional interpretation of these rules, Jane Roe's appeal was "moot" because she had already given birth to her child and thus would not be affected by the ruling; she also lacked "standing" to assert the rights of other pregnant women. <ref>Abernathy, M. et al., ''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0872498549&id=tHhlYpWokFIC&pg=RA1-PA4&lpg=RA1-PA4&ots=OeQSTLp91C&dq=standing+and+mootness+and+%22roe+v.+wade%22&num=100&sig=gfDTMq-LyUVI-lg8tNreUQFjX6c Civil Liberties Under the Constitution]'' (U. South Carolina 1993), page 4. Retrieved 2007-02-04. </ref> As she did not present an "actual [[case or controversy]]" (a grievance and a demand for relief), any opinion issued by the Supreme Court would constitute an [[advisory opinion]], a practice forbidden by Article III of the United States Constitution.  . 

The Court concluded that the case came within an established exception to the rule; one that allowed consideration of an issue that was "capable of repetition, yet evading review". <ref>{{cite book |title=Federal Jurisdiction |series=Introduction to Law |first=Erwin |last=Chemerinsky |authorlink=Erwin Chemerinsky |edition=4th |publisher=Aspen Publishers |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7355-2718-8 |page=132 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wgpGAQAAIAAJ}}</ref> This phrase had been coined in 1911 by Justice [[Joseph McKenna]]. <ref>''Southern Pacific v.

Retrieved 2007-01-26</ref> Blackmun's opinion quoted McKenna, and noted that pregnancy would normally conclude more quickly than an appellate process: "If that termination makes a case moot, pregnancy litigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and appellate review will be effectively denied."{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} . 

== Dissents ==. 
[[Image:Justice White Official.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Byron White]] was the senior dissenting justice.]]
Justices [[Byron R. White]] and [[William H. Rehnquist]] wrote emphatic dissenting opinions in this case. White wrote:
{{quote|I find nothing in the language or history of the Constitution to support the Court's judgment. The Court simply fashions and announces a new constitutional right for pregnant women and, with scarcely any reason or authority for its action, invests that right with sufficient substance to override most existing state abortion statutes. The upshot is that the people and the legislatures of the 50 States are constitutionally disentitled to weigh the relative importance of the continued existence and development of the fetus, on the one hand, against a spectrum of possible impacts on the woman, on the other hand. As an exercise of raw judicial power, the Court perhaps has authority to do what it does today; but, in my view, its judgment is an improvident and extravagant exercise of the power of judicial review that the Constitution extends to this Court. <ref name="Doe" /><ref>Potts, Malcolm et al. ''Abortion'', page 347 (1977). </ref>}} . 

White asserted that the Court "values the convenience of the pregnant mother more than the continued existence and development of the life or potential life that she carries." Despite White suggesting he "might agree" with the Court's values and priorities, he wrote that he saw "no constitutional warrant for imposing such an order of priorities on the people and legislatures of the States." White criticized the Court for involving itself in this issue by creating "a constitutional barrier to state efforts to protect human life and by investing mothers and doctors with the constitutionally protected right to exterminate it." He would have left this issue, for the most part, "with the people and to the political processes the people have devised to govern their affairs." . 

Rehnquist elaborated upon several of White's points, by asserting that the Court's historical analysis was flawed:
{{quote|To reach its result, the Court necessarily has had to find within the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment a right that was apparently completely unknown to the drafters of the Amendment. As early as 1821, the first state law dealing directly with abortion was enacted by the Connecticut Legislature. By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, there were at least 36 laws enacted by state or territorial legislatures limiting abortion. While many States have amended or updated their laws, 21 of the laws on the books in 1868 remain in effect today. <ref name="Roe">''Roe v. Wade'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/410/113.html 410 U.S. 113] (1972). Findlaw.com. Retrieved 2007-01-26</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Currie |first=David |title=The Constitution in the Supreme Court: The Second Century, 1888–1986|Volume=2|page=470|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1994}}</ref><ref>"[http://www.economist.com/node/4134124 Rehnquist's legacy]", ''[[The Economist]]'' (2005-06-30). </ref>}} . 

From this historical record, Rehnquist concluded that, "There apparently was no question concerning the validity of this provision or of any of the other state statutes when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted." Therefore, in his view, "the drafters did not intend to have the Fourteenth Amendment withdraw from the States the power to legislate with respect to this matter." . 

== Reception == . 

===Political=== . 

The most prominent organized groups that mobilized in response to ''Roe'' are the [[NARAL Pro-Choice America|National Abortion Rights Action League]] on the pro-choice side, and the [[National Right to Life Committee]] on the pro-life side.  .

Advocates of ''Roe'' describe it as vital to the preservation of [[women's rights]], personal freedom, and privacy. Denying the abortion right has been equated to compulsory motherhood, and some scholars (not including any member of the Supreme Court) have argued that abortion bans therefore violate the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]]: . 

{{quote|When women are compelled to carry and bear children, they are subjected to 'involuntary servitude' in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment….[E]ven if the woman has stipulated to have consented to the risk of pregnancy, that does not permit the state to force her to remain pregnant. <ref name="Koppelman" />}} . 

Some pro-life supporters maintain that [[person]]hood begins at [[fertilization]] (also referred to as [[Conception (biology)|conception]]), and should therefore be protected by the Constitution;<ref name="Balkin"/> the dissenting justices in ''Roe'' instead wrote that decisions about abortion "should be left with the people and to the political processes the people have devised to govern their affairs."<ref name="Doe">''Doe v.

The majority opinion allowed states to protect "fetal life after viability" even though a fetus is not "a person within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment".   Supporters of ''Roe'' contend that the decision has a valid constitutional foundation, or contend that justification for the result in ''Roe'' could be found in the Constitution but not in the articles referenced in the decision. <ref name="Balkin">''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0814799183&id=Us-277i9ZJYC&pg=PP1 What Roe v.

Opponents of ''Roe'' have asserted that the decision lacks a valid constitutional foundation. Like the dissenters in ''Roe'', they have maintained that the Constitution is silent on the issue, and that proper solutions to the question would best be found via state legislatures and the legislative process, rather than through an all-encompassing ruling from the Supreme Court.  . 

A prominent argument against the ''Roe'' decision is that, in the absence of consensus about when meaningful life begins, it is best to avoid the risk of doing harm. <ref>Reagan, Ronald.

Kennedy wrote that since this dilation and evacuation procedure remained available in Nebraska, the state was free to ban the other procedure sometimes called "partial birth abortion."<ref name="Stenberg"/> .

Carhart]]'' that a state's ban on "partial birth abortion" was unconstitutional because such a ban would not allow for the health of the woman. The membership of the Court changed after ''Stenberg'', with [[John G. Roberts|John Roberts]] and [[Samuel Alito]] replacing Rehnquist and O'Connor, respectively. Further, the ban at issue in ''Gonzales v. Carhart'' was a clear federal statute, rather than a relatively vague state statute as in the ''Stenberg'' case.  . 

On April 18, 2007, the Supreme Court handed down a 5 to 4 decision upholding the constitutionality of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, asserting that Congress was within its power to generally ban the procedure, although the Court left the door open for as-applied challenges. Kennedy's opinion did not reach the question whether the Court's prior decisions in ''Roe v. Wade'', ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'', and ''Stenberg v. Carhart'' were valid, and instead the Court said that the challenged statute is consistent with those prior decisions whether or not those prior decisions were valid.  . 

Joining the majority were Chief Justice [[John G. Roberts|John Roberts]], Scalia, Thomas, and Alito. Ginsburg and the other three justices dissented, contending that the ruling ignored Supreme Court abortion precedent, and also offering an equality-based justification for that abortion precedent. Thomas filed a concurring opinion, joined by Scalia, contending that the Court's prior decisions in ''Roe v. Wade'' and ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'' should be reversed, and also noting that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act may exceed the powers of Congress under the [[Commerce Clause]].  . 

=== Activities of Norma McCorvey ===. 
[[Norma McCorvey]] became a member of the pro-life movement in 1995; she now supports making abortion illegal. In 1998, she testified to Congress:
{{quote|It was my pseudonym, Jane Roe, which had been used to create the "right" to abortion out of legal thin air. But Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee never told me that what I was signing would allow women to come up to me 15, 20 years later and say, "Thank you for allowing me to have my five or six abortions. Without you, it wouldn't have been possible." Sarah never mentioned women using abortions as a form of birth control. We talked about truly desperate and needy women, not women already wearing maternity clothes. <ref name="testimony"/>}} . 

As a party to the original litigation, she sought to reopen the case in [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]] in Texas to have ''Roe v. Wade'' overturned. However, the [[Fifth Circuit]] decided that her case was moot, in ''[[McCorvey v. Hill]]''. <ref>''McCorvey v. Hill'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/circs/5th/0310711p.pdf 385 F3d 846 (PDF)] (5th Cir 2004). Findlaw.com. Retrieved 2007-01-26</ref> In a concurring opinion, Judge [[Edith Jones]] agreed that McCorvey was raising legitimate questions about emotional and other harm suffered by women who have had abortions, about increased resources available for the care of unwanted children, and about new scientific understanding of fetal development, but Jones said she was compelled to agree that the case was moot. On February 22, 2005, the Supreme Court refused to grant a [[certiorari|writ of certiorari]], and McCorvey's appeal ended.  .

President [[Richard Nixon]] did not publicly comment about the decision. <ref>{{cite book| last=Reeves| first=Richard | authorlink=Richard Reeves (American writer) |url=http://books.google.com/?id=AdBdPvGxdaIC&pg=PA563 | title= President Nixon: Alone in the White House| page=563 |year=2001| isbn=0-684-80231-7| publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |edition=1st |quote=The President did not comment directly on the decision.}}</ref> In private conversation later revealed as part of the [[Nixon tapes]], Nixon said "There are times when an abortion is necessary, I know that.

Generally, presidential opinion has been split between major party lines. The ''Roe'' decision was opposed by [[President of the United States|Presidents]] [[Gerald Ford]],<ref>Ford, Gerald.

President [[Jimmy Carter]] supported legal abortion from an early point in his political career, in order to prevent birth defects and in other extreme cases; he encouraged the outcome in ''Roe'' and generally supported abortion rights. <ref>Carter, James Earl. ''Larry King Live'', CNN, [http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0602/01/lkl.02.html Interview With Jimmy Carter] (2006-02-01). Also see [[Peter Bourne|Bourne, Peter]], ''Jimmy Carter: A Comprehensive Biography from Plains to Postpresidency'': "Early in his term as governor, Carter had strongly supported family planning programs including abortion in order to save the life of a woman, birth defects, or in other extreme circumstances. Years later, he had written the foreword to a book, Women in Need, that favored a woman's right to abortion. He had given private encouragement to the plaintiffs in a lawsuit, Doe v. Bolton, filed against the state of Georgia to overturn its archaic abortion laws."</ref> ''Roe'' was also supported by President [[Bill Clinton]]. <ref>Clinton, Bill. ''[[My Life (Bill Clinton autobiography)|My Life]]'', page 229 (Knopf 2004). </ref> President [[Barack Obama]] has taken the position that "Abortions should be legally available in accordance with ''Roe v.

=== State laws regarding ''Roe'' ===. 
Several states have enacted so-called [[trigger law]]s which would take effect in the event that ''Roe v. Wade'' is overturned. Those states include Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota and South Dakota. <ref name="Vestal">Vestal, Christine. [http://www.stateline.org/live/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=136&languageId=1&contentId=121780 "States probe limits of abortion policy"], Stateline.org (2007-06-11). </ref> Additionally, many states did not repeal pre-1973 statutes that criminalized abortion, and some of those statutes could again be in force if ''Roe'' was reversed. <ref>Marcus, Frances Frank. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE5D71738F93BA35754C0A96F948260 “Louisiana Moves Against Abortion”], ''[[New York Times]]'' (1989-07-08). </ref> . 

Other states have passed laws to maintain the legality of abortion if ''Roe v. Wade'' is overturned. Those states include California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Nevada and Washington. <ref name="Vestal" /> .
