'''Societal attitudes towards abortion''' have varied throughout different [[history of abortion|historical periods]] and [[culture]]s. One manner of assessing such attitudes in the modern era has been to conduct [[opinion poll]]s to measure levels of [[public opinion]] on [[abortion]].  . 

==Attitudes by region==. 
===Africa===. 
*'''[[South Africa]]:''' A 2003 [[Human Sciences Research Council (South Africa)|Human Sciences Research Council]] study examined moral attitudes among South Africans:<ref>Rule, Stephen. (2004).

Retrieved March 25, 2007. </ref>
** 56% said they believed that abortion is wrong even if there is a strong chance of serious defect in the fetus. 
** 70% said they believed that abortion is wrong if done primarily because the parents have low income and may be unable to afford another child.  . 

===Europe===. 
*'''[[Austria]]:''' A May 2007 OGM survey examined Austrian opinion on the morality of abortion, asking, "Personally, do you think of abortion as a moral issue?" 20% of those polled replied, "yes, always", 59% replied "yes, under certain circumstances", 19% replied "no, never", and 2% replied that they were "not sure". <ref>"[http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/index.cfm/fuseaction/viewItem/itemID/15961 Abortion Sometimes a Moral Issue, Say Austrians]."

A survey in the United States of more than 10,000 physicians (not only obstetricians) came to the result that 34% of physicians would perform an abortion in certain situations, even if it were against own beliefs. Approximately 54% would not, and for the remaining 12%, it would depend on circumstances. <ref name=kane>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/731485_7 Doctors Struggle With Tougher-Than-Ever Dilemmas: Other Ethical Issues] Author: Leslie Kane. 11/11/2010</ref> .
