The '''blockade of the Gaza Strip''' refers to a land, air, and sea [[blockade]] on the [[Gaza Strip]] by [[Israel]] and [[Egypt]] since June 2007, a more severe version of restrictions which began in 2001. Israel eased the blockade for non-military goods in June 2010, and Egypt reopened the Rafah border crossing in 2011 for persons. <ref>{{cite news |title=Opening of Rafah crossing spells end of Israel's blockade of Gaza |author=Avi Issacharoff and Amos Harel |url=http://www.haaretz.com/blogs/2.244/opening-of-rafah-crossing-spells-end-of-israel-s-blockade-of-gaza-1.364634 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=2011-05-29 |accessdate=2012-03-22}}</ref><ref name=CBS>{{cite news|title=After 4 years, Egypt reopens its border with Gaza|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/05/28/ap/world/main20067138.shtml|accessdate=14 July 2011|publisher=[[CBS]]|date=29 May 2011|deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=December 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> . 

In 2006 [[Hamas]] won the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006|Palestinian legislative election]], triggering the [[2006-2007 economic sanctions against the Palestinian National Authority]] by Israel and the [[Quartet on the Middle East]]. In March 2007, Hamas and [[Fatah]] formed a [[Palestinan authority national unity government]] headed by [[Ismail Haniya]]. Shortly after, in June, Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in the course of the [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|Battle of Gaza]],<ref name=Guardian>{{cite news|title=Hamas takes control of Gaza|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/jun/15/israel4|accessdate=3 June 2010|newspaper=Guardian|date=Friday 15 June 2007 | location=London | first1=Ian | last1=Black | first2=Mark | last2=Tran}}</ref> seizing government institutions and replacing Fatah and other government officials with its own. <ref name="intern_fight_p14-15">{{cite book | title= Internal fight: Palestinian abuses in Gaza and the West Bank | pages= 14–15 | author2= [[Human Rights Watch]] | first1= Fred | last1= Abrahams | publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] | year= 2008 }}</ref>  Following the takeover, Egypt and Israel largely sealed their border crossings with Gaza, on the grounds that Fatah had fled and was no longer providing security on the Palestinian side. <ref name="washingtonpost.com">Dion Nissenbaum.

Israel maintains that the blockade is necessary to limit [[Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel|Palestinian rocket attacks]] from the Gaza Strip on its cities and to prevent Hamas from obtaining other weapons. Prior to its 2011 opening of the [[Rafah crossing]], Egypt maintained that it could not fully open its side of the border since completely opening the border would represent Egyptian recognition of the Hamas control of Gaza, undermine the legitimacy of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] and consecrate the split between Gaza and the West Bank. <ref name="egypt"/>  . 

Facing mounting international calls to ease or lift their blockade in response to the [[Gaza flotilla raid]], Egypt and Israel lessened the restrictions starting in June 2010.  Israel announced that it will allow all strictly civilian goods into Gaza while preventing certain weapons and what it designates as "dual-use" items from entering Gaza. <ref name="google1">{{cite web|last=Rabinowitz |first=Gavin |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hYVYAfX_Mu7L_Kv-VU_3g4XdDiSA |title=AFP: Israel to allow more 'civilian' goods into Gaza: official |publisher=Google  |date=20 June 2010 |accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref> Egypt partly opened the Rafah border crossing from Egypt to Gaza, primarily for people, but not for supplies, to go through. <ref name=egypttoday/> Israel continues to severely restrict and/or prevent people from entering or exiting Gaza. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://gisha.org/index.php?intLanguage=2&intItemId=1832&intSiteSN=113 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110726104601/http://gisha.org/index.php?intLanguage=2&intItemId=1832&intSiteSN=113 |archivedate=26 July 2011 |title=Gisha Site |publisher=Gisha.org |accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gisha.org/index.php?intLanguage=2&intItemId=1848&intSiteSN=113|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110726105923/http://gisha.org/index.php?intLanguage=2&intItemId=1848&intSiteSN=113| archivedate=7 October 2010 |title=Gisha Site |publisher=Gisha.org |date=8 July 2010 |accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gisha.org/index.php?intLanguage=2&intItemId=1822&intSiteSN=113|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110726110234/http://gisha.org/index.php?intLanguage=2&intItemId=1822&intSiteSN=113 |archivedate=26 July 2011 |title=Gisha Site |publisher=Gisha.org |date=22 June 2010 |accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref> The Israeli NGO Gisha Legal Center for Freedom of Movement asserted in [http://gisha.org/UserFiles/File/publications/UnravelingTheClosureEng.pdf a July 2010 report] that Israel continues to prevent normal functioning of the Gazan economy.

Opinion on the legality of the blockade is mixed. In September 2011, a UN investigative committee concluded in the [[Gaza flotilla raid#UN Palmer Report|Palmer Report]] that the naval blockade is legal and had to be judged isolated from the restrictions on goods reaching Gaza via the land crossings. Concerning the restrictions on goods reaching Gaza via the land crossings the Palmer report stated that they were the main reason for a unsustainable and unacceptable humanitarian situation in Gaza. <ref>{{cite web|last=Palmer|first=Geoffrey|title=Report of the Secretary-General’s Panel of Inquiry on the 31 May 2010 Flotilla Incident|url=http://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/middle_east/Gaza_Flotilla_Panel_Report.pdf|publisher=UN|accessdate=12 October 2011}}</ref><ref name="nytimes-palmer">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/02/world/middleeast/02flotilla.html  |title=Report Finds Naval Blockade by Israel Legal but Faults Raid |work=The New York Times |date=2 September 2011 |first1=Neil |last1=MacFarquhar |first2=Ethan |last2=Bronner}}</ref><ref name="un-palmer">{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/middle_east/Gaza_Flotilla_Panel_Report.pdf |title=UN Palmer Report}}</ref><ref name="jpost.com">{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=236369 |title= Palmer report: Gaza blockade legal, IDF force excessive}}</ref> UN envoy [[Desmond Tutu]], [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] head [[Navi Pillay]], the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and, according to [[Richard Falk]], most experts on international law<ref name=RFALK /> consider the blockade illegal. <ref name="28 May 2008; U.N. envoy Tutu calls Gaza blockade illegal">{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUSL2849170120080528 |agency=Reuters   | title=U.N. envoy Tutu calls Gaza blockade illegal | date=28 May 2008}}</ref><ref name="18 November 2008; UN rights chief urges Israel to end 'illegal' Gaza blockade">{{cite web|url=http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=206381 |title=Maan News Agency: UN rights chief urges Israel to end 'illegal' Gaza blockade |publisher=Maannews.net |date=18 November 2008 |accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref><ref name="14 August 2009; U.N.

==Background==. 
===1989–2004===. 
Since June 1989, Israel has formally restricted the movement of Palestinians, imposing a magnetic-card system whereby only those with such a card were allowed to leave the Strip: Israeli authorities did not issue magnetic cards to released prisoners, former administrative detainees, or people who had been detained and released without charges being filed against them. <ref name="btselem.org">http://www.btselem.org/English/Freedom_of_Movement/Closure.asp"Closure"</ref>  January 1991 marked the beginning of the permanent closure policy, whereby each resident of Gaza who desired to travel within Israel or the West Bank was required to have a personal exit permit. <ref name="btselem.org"/> In March 1993, Israel imposed an overall closure on Gaza with newly built checkpoints; and, from October 2000, Israel imposed a comprehensive closure on the Gaza Strip. <ref name="btselem.org"/> . 

When the [[Al-Aqsa Intifada]] broke out in September 2000 Israel put trade restrictions on the [[Gaza Strip]] and closed the [[Gaza International Airport]]. The economic effects worsened after the creation of a ‘buffer zone’ in September 2001, that would seal all entry and exit points in the [[Palestinian Territories]] for "security reasons." After 9 October 2001, movement of people and goods across the ‘[[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]]’ dividing the [[West Bank]] from [[Israel]], and between the Gaza Strip and Israel, was halted, and a complete internal closure was effected on 14 November 2001. <ref>'Palestinian goods were subsequently denied passage through the West Bank border crossings with Jordan. Gaza’s Rafah crossings with Egypt and Israeli transit facilities. Thousands of truck-loads of goods were impounded in Israeli ports. After 14 November, the Israeli army imposed an almost complete internal closure on the territories. The economic blockade deprived the PA of the taxes in goods and salaries of those Palestinians employed in Israel'. Lucy Dean (ed.)''The Middle East and North Africa, 2004'', Routledge, London 2003 p.924</ref> The worsening economic and humanitarian situation raised great concern abroad. According to the [[UN Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD), in January 2003, the Israeli blockade and closures had pushed the Palestinian economy into a stage of de-development and drained as much as US $2.4&nbsp;billion out of the economy of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. <ref>Lucy Dean (ed.),''The Middle East and North Africa, 2004'', Routledge 2003 p.925</ref> . 

===2005 Agreement on Movement and Access===. 
The [[Israel Defence Forces]] left the Gaza Strip on 1 September 2005 as part of [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan]]. An 'Agreement on Movement and Access' between Israel and the [[Palestinian Authority]] was brokered by [[Condoleezza Rice]] in November 2005 to improve Palestinian freedom of movement and economic activity in the Gaza Strip. Under its terms, the [[Rafah]] crossing with [[Egypt]] was to be reopened, with transits monitored by the Palestinian National Authority and the [[European Union]]. Only people with Palestinian ID, or foreign nationals, by exception, in certain categories, subject to Israeli oversight, were permitted to cross in and out. All goods, vehicles and trucks to and from Egypt had to pass through the Israeli crossing at [[Kerem Shalom]], under full Israeli supervision. <ref>[[Tanya Reinhart]], ''The Road to Nowhere,'' Verso, London 2006 pp.134–5</ref> Goods were also permitted transit at the [[Karni crossing]] in the north.  . 

===2006–2007 economic sanctions===. 
{{Main|2006–2007 economic sanctions against the Palestinian National Authority}} . 

The 2006–2007 economic sanctions against the Palestinian National Authority were [[economic sanctions]] imposed by [[Israel]] and the [[Quartet on the Middle East]] against the [[Palestinian National Authority]] and the [[Palestinian territories]] following the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006|January 2006 legislative elections]] that brought [[Hamas]] to power. <ref>{{cite news|date=18 February 2006|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/18/international/middleeast/18mideast.html|title=Hamas Leader Faults Israeli Sanction Plan|work=The New York Times | first=Steven | last=Erlanger | accessdate=22 April 2010}}</ref> In March 2007, the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]] established a national unity government, with 83 representatives voting in favor and three against. Government ministers were sworn in by [[Mahmoud Abbas]], the chairman on the Palestinian Authority, in a ceremony held simultaneously in Gaza and Ramallah.  . 

Throughout 2006, the [[Karni crossing]] remained only partially operational, costing Palestinians losses of $500,000 a day, as less than 10% of the Gaza Strip's minimal daily export targets were achieved. Basic food commodities were severely depleted, bakeries closed and food rationing was introduced. <ref>''Report of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People.''Sixty-first session, Supplement No.35 (A/61/35).

===June 2007 – January 2008===. 
In June 2007 Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip<ref name="Guardian"/> and removed [[Fatah]] officials. Following the [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|Battle of Gaza]], the international sanctions were terminated in June 2007 while at the same time a new and more severe blockade of the Gaza Strip was initiated.  . 

In response to the violent clashes, President Abbas declared a state of emergency and dissolved the national unity government on 14 June. Prime Minister [[Ismail Haniyeh]] called this decision "hasty", and pledged to stay in power. Hamas gained complete control of the Gaza Strip on 15 June,<ref name="Guardian"/> after forcing out Fatah.  . 

Following the takeover, Egypt and Israel largely sealed their border crossings with Gaza, on the grounds that Fatah had fled and was no longer providing security on the Palestinian side. <ref name="washingtonpost.com"/> . 

In July 2007, Israeli officials planned an opening of the Rafah border crossing in order to allow stranded Palestinians to return, but the plan was cancelled after Hamas threatened to fire on the refugees. <ref>[http://www.jpost.com Hamas threats to keep crossing closed]</ref> . 

A Jerusalem Post article mentions Hamas' complaints that since June 2008 the P.A. does not deliver any more passports to the Gazans thus trapping them tightly. <ref>{{cite web|last=Bar |first=Michael |url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=177779 |title=Turkey’s support of Hamas worries PA |work=Jerusalem Post  |date=13 June 2010 |accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref> . 

Egypt, fearing a spill-over of Hamas-style militancy into their territory, kept its border with Gaza largely sealed. <ref name="Guardian230108">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jan/23/egypt.israelandthepalestinians Palestinians flood into Egypt after blowing up border wall], [[The Guardian]], 23 January 2008. </ref> Israel sealed the border completely on 17 January in response to [[List of rocket and mortar attacks in Israel in 2008|rocket attacks on southern Israel]] and [[Palestinian militant]] attacks on crossing points between Israel and Gaza. <ref name=truck_bomb>{{cite news|title=Truck bomb destroys Gaza-Israel pedestrian crossing|work=USA Today|agency=Associated Press|date=22 May 2008|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-05-22-israel-palestinians_N.htm?csp=34}}</ref><ref name = sanctions_legal>{{cite news|title=Gaza sanctions: The legal argument |publisher=BBC |agency=Associated Press|date=30 October 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7069203.stm | first=Paul | last=Reynolds}}</ref> .

===January 2008 breach of the Gaza-Egypt border===. 
{{Main|2008 breach of the Gaza-Egypt border}}
On 22 January 2008, Palestinians clashed with Egyptian police in front of the border, demanding that the Rafah crossing be opened. The clashes included live fire, and there were injuries on both sides. Fifty women managed to cross, and Egyptian police responded with a water cannon assault. Additional Egyptian security forces arrived, and managed to restore calm and prevent Palestinians from crossing. <ref>[[Al Jazeera English]] – Gazans clash with Egyptian police at Rafah – 22 January 08</ref> . 

The breach of the Gaza-Egypt border began on 23 January 2008, after gunmen in the [[Gaza Strip]] set off an explosion near the [[Rafah Border Crossing]], destroying part of the former [[Israeli Gaza Strip barrier]]. The United Nations estimated that as many as half of the population of the Gaza Strip crossed the border into [[Egypt]] seeking food and supplies. <ref name="BBC25">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7208252.stm |title=Gazans make new border wall hole: Palestinians have bulldozed down part of the Gaza-Egypt border wall again, hours after Egyptian troops blocked holes recently made by militants|work=BBC News  |date=25 January 2008 }}</ref> Israel said that militants had exploited the breach in the border wall to send armed men into the Sinai to infiltrate Israel across the Sinai-Israel border. Egyptian troops at first permitted crossing<ref name="Guardian230108"/> but did not allow Palestinians to travel further than [[El Arish]]. On 25 January, Egyptian forces blocked almost all [[illegal entry]] points to stem the flow of Gazans pouring in, and Egyptian riot police erected barbed wire and chain-link fences along the border. Palestinians used a bulldozer to knock down the fence and once again flooded in. Egyptian border police began stopping Palestinians from crossing and sealed the road from Rafah to El Arish. On 28 January, Egyptian security forces and Hamas militants strung barbed wire across one of the breaches, sealing it off. The Egyptians began repairing one of the two remaining breaches on 29 January, and closed the border with the Gaza Strip on 3 February 2008.  . 

===Mid-2008 violence===. 
Throughout mid-2008, [[Israel]] continued to inspect all humanitarian aid for Gaza and delivering approved items through the crossing points of [[Karni Crossing|Karni]], [[Kerem Shalom Crossing|Kerem Shalom]], [[Erez Crossing|Erez]], and [[Sufa, Israel|Sufa]].  . 

Throughout this period, [[Hamas]] launched raids against these crossing points. The first was an 9 April infiltration by four Hamas fighters through the Kerem Shalom border crossing. The four fighters attacked a terminal in [[Nahal Oz]] being used to deliver fuel to Gaza, killing two workers. Three of the fighters were subsequently killed by Israeli strikes as they attempted to flee. <ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3iPjHAPYQs Two Israelis Killed In Terrorist Infiltration At Kibbutz Nah]</ref> . 

On 19 April, Hamas launched another attack against a border crossing in the early morning hours. Three fighters were killed in the operation, and thirteen Israeli soldiers were wounded.  . 

===June 2008 attempt at easing restrictions===. 
Under a [[2008 Israel–Hamas ceasefire|ceasefire agreement]] between Israel and Hamas in June 2008, Israel agreed to lift its blockade of Gaza Strip. It was reported that in August 2008, Israel was still allowing in very few goods. <ref>{{cite news|title=Truce barely eases Gaza embargo|publisher=BBC |author=Aleem Maqbool|date=19 August 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7570605.stm}}</ref> At Egypt's request, Israel did not always respond to Palestinian cease fire violations by closing the border. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-07-06-3462899240_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Israel reopens Gaza border crossings | date=6 July 2008 | accessdate=22 April 2010}}</ref> .

In August 2008, the first [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]-organized attempt to breach Israel's maritime closure of the Gaza Strip took place when two vessels manned by activists from the [[Free Gaza Movement]] and [[International Solidarity Movement]] sailed from [[Cyprus]] towards Gaza, carrying hearing aids and balloons. The boats reached Gaza on 23 August after the Israeli government decided to let them through. <ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7578880.stm</ref> . 

On 28 October 2008, the 66-foot yacht ''Dignity'', manned by [[Free Gaza Movement]] activists and carrying medical supplies, docked in Gaza harbor. Israel had initially decided to stop the vessel, but the decision was made to let it through just before it reached Gaza. <ref>http://www.jta.org/news/article/2008/10/28/110907/gazaboat</ref> . 

===2008–2009 Gaza war and aftermath===.

[[Mark Regev]], spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] stated "We want to make sure that reconstruction for the people of Gaza is not reconstruction for the Hamas regime." U.S. State Department spokesman Robert Wood said on 25 February that "Aid should never be used as a political weapon. We'll try to push to get into Gaza as many supplies as possible."<ref name="Archived"/> . 

The [[Ehud Olmert|Olmert]] cabinet had decided in March 2009 that food and medical supplies to Gaza would be allowed through unfettered. This was met with resistance by Israel's Defense Ministry, which controls the border crossings. <ref name="Prusher"/> . 

An Israeli military spokesperson said that each item was decided on an individual basis and that food was being let through daily. According to Tel Aviv NGO Gisha, the amount of food entering Gaza is as of May 2009, about 25% of the pre-June 2007 figures. A UN study has found that Gazan families are eating fewer meals a day and mainly relying on [[carbohydrates]] such as rice and flour because protein foods are expensive or unavailable. Chicken eggs have doubled in price due to the destruction of chicken coops during the Gaza War. <ref name="Prusher"/> .

On 31 May 2010 the [[Israeli Navy]] seized an aid convoy of six ships known as the "Gaza Freedom Flotilla". <ref name=ibhsguardqa53>{{Cite news|first=Ian |last=Black |author2=Haroon Siddique |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/may/31/q-a-gaza-freedom-flotilla |title=Q&A: The Gaza Freedom flotilla |newspaper=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |date=31 May 201http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:New_contributors%27_help_page0 |accessdate=2 June 2010 | location=London}}</ref> aiming to break through the blockade. The flotilla had declined an Israeli request to change course to the [[port of Ashdod]], where the Israeli government had said it would inspect the aid and deliver (or let humanitarian organizations deliver) Israeli-approved items to Gaza. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-gaza-aid-convoy-can-unload-cargo-in-ashdod-for-inspection-1.292560|title=Israel: Gaza aid convoy can unload cargo in Ashdod for inspection |author=Barak Ravid|coauthors=Yuval Azoulay|publisher=Haaretz|date=27 May 2010|accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref> . 

Israeli [[Shayetet 13]] naval commandos boarded the ships from speedboats and helicopters launched from three missile ships. On the [[MV Mavi Marmara|MV ''Mavi Marmara'']], the main ship of the convoy, passengers fiercely resisted the boarding with makeshift weapons and live fire, including from guns seized from soldiers. Passengers managed to capture three soldiers. <ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LulDJh4fWI|video of armed protesters]</ref> After failing to disperse the activists using non-lethal means, the soldiers resorted to live fire. On other ships, soldiers were met with passive resistance which was easily suppressed with non-lethal techniques. Nine passengers were killed and dozens wounded. Nine soldiers were also injured, two of them seriously. All of the ships were seized and towed to [[Ashdod]], while passengers were imprisoned in Israel and then deported to their home countries. <ref>[http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/08/31/897697/-The-Dead-and-the-Wounded-of-the-Mavi-Marmara Daily Kos: The Dead and The Wounded of the Mavi Marmara]</ref><ref name="haaretz-at least">{{cite news|title=Israel Navy commandos: Gaza flotilla activists tried to lynch us|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/at-least-10-activists-killed-in-israel-navy-clashes-onboard-gaza-aid-flotilla-1.293089|author=Amos Harel|coauthors=Avi Issacharoff, Anshel Pfeffer and News Agencies|date=31 May 2010|work=Haaretz}}</ref><ref name="NY Times Israel Frees">{{cite news|last=Slackman|first=Michael|work=New York Times|title=In Bid to Quell Anger Over Raid, Israel Frees Detainees|date=3 June 2010|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/03/world/middleeast/03flotilla.html|accessdate=3 June 2010}}</ref><ref name="BBC Convoy raid">{{cite news|last=Reynolds|first=Paul|publisher=BBC News |title=Israeli convoy raid: What went wrong?|date=2 June 2010|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/middle_east/10203333.stm|accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref> <ref name=AJfunerals>{{cite web | title = Turkey holds activists' funerals |publisher=Al Jazeera English | accessdate =3 June 2010 | date = 3 June 2010 | url = http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/06/2010639114160373.html}}</ref><ref name=latimes>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-israel-flotilla-20100531,0,1839736.story

===Freedom Flotilla II===. 
{{Main|Freedom Flotilla II}}
Following the Gaza flotilla raid, a coalition of 22 [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s assembled a flotilla of 10 vessels and 1,000 activists to breach the blockade. The vessels docked in [[Greece]] in preparation for the journey to Gaza. However, the Greek government announced that it would not allow the vessels to leave for Gaza,<ref>http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/0705/Israel-s-new-friend-Why-Greece-is-thwarting-Gaza-flotilla</ref> and the [[Hellenic Coast Guard]] stopped three vessels attempting to evade the travel ban and leave port. On 7 July, most activists left for home, leaving only a few dozen to continue the initiative. <ref>http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=228372</ref> On 16 July, the French yacht ''Dignite Al Karama'' was allowed to leave port after informing Greek authorities that its destination was [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]]. Instead, the yacht headed directly for Gaza. The [[Israeli Navy]] stopped the ''Dignite Al Karama'' about 65 kilometers off Gaza. After the boat was warned and refused to turn back, it was surrounded by three Israeli naval vessels and boarded by [[Shayetet 13]] commandos, who took it over. The boat was then taken to [[Ashdod]]. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-07-19/world/israel.gaza.flotilla_1_free-gaza-movement-gaza-coast-gaza-bound?_s=PM:WORLD | work=CNN | title=Israel deporting 15 foreigners aboard Gaza-bound boat | date=20 July 2011}}</ref> . 

===Third Flotilla===. 
On 4 November 2011, the Israeli Navy intercepted two vessels heading towards Gaza in a private initiative to break the blockade. Shayetet 13 commandos boarded the vessels from speedboats and took them over with no resistance. The vessels were then taken to Ashdod port. <ref>http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-navy-intercepts-gaza-bound-aid-vessels-no-injuries-reported-1.393717</ref> . 

==June 2010 easing of the blockade==. 
Following the [[Gaza flotilla raid]], Israel and Egypt faced mounting international calls to ease or lift their blockade.  . 

On 1 June 2010, the Rafah border crossing from Egypt to Gaza was partially opened. Egypt’s foreign ministry has made it clear that the crossing will remain open mainly for people, not for aid, to go through. <ref name=egypttoday/> Several aid trucks began making it into Gaza during the following morning including some carrying power generators from the Egyptian [[Red Crescent]], and hundreds of Gazans who had been staying in Egypt returned home, although little traffic, human or cargo, flowed from Gaza to Egypt. <ref name="mubarakopen">Shenker, Jack (2 June 2010). [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jun/02/rafah-crossing-gaza-egypt-dilemma "Opening Rafah crossing as lifeline for Gaza poses dilemma for Egypt"]. ''The Guardian'' (UK)</ref> On 3 June, the manager of the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing, Salameh Barakeh, explained that the crossing is open for the free travel of patients, foreign passport holders, those with residency status in other countries, students and internationals. <ref>[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=289341 Rafah crossing open for third consecutive day], Ma'an News Agency, 3 June 2010</ref>  The Arab Physicians Union officials submitted a request to Egyptian authorities on 3 June 2010 to send 400 tons of food, blankets, electric generators for hospitals and construction material from Egypt to Gaza, but their request was denied by Egyptian authorities without specific reason. Emad Gad, political analyst at Egyptian Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, believes the government should keep the Rafah border under control because opening it completely could allow weapons smuggling or illegal financial transactions. <ref name=egypttoday>[http://www.egypttoday.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=9067 A Crack in the Blockade, Egypt Today, July 2010]</ref> . 

On 17 June 2010, Israel's Prime Minister's Office announced that Israel's security cabinet had agreed to relax Israel's blockade on the Gaza Strip, and issued an English-language press release, according to which a decision to ease the blockade had been made. The English text reads: "It was agreed to liberalize the system by which civilian goods enter Gaza [and] expand the inflow of materials for civilian projects that are under international supervision." However, no binding decision has been made during the cabinet meeting, and an announcement issued in Hebrew did not mention any such decision. The Prime Minister's office said that a meeting would be held soon, and expressed hope that a binding decision will be taken then. <ref>{{cite news|last=Barak|first=Ravid|journal=Haaretz|title=Government announces let-up to Gaza siege – but only in English|date=17 June 2010|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/government-announces-let-up-to-gaza-siege-but-only-in-english-1.296809|accessdate=18 June 2010}}</ref> . 

On 20 June 2010, Israel's Security Cabinet approved a new system governing the blockade that would allow practically all non-military items to enter the Gaza strip. According to a cabinet statement, Israel would "expand the transfer of construction materials designated for projects that have been approved by the Palestinian Authority, including schools, health institutions, water, sanitation and more – as well as (projects) that are under international supervision." Despite the easing of the land blockade, Israel announced to continue to inspect all goods bound for Gaza by sea at the port of [[Ashdod]]. Internationally, this decision received mixed reactions.  . 

===International Response to Easing of Restrictions===. 
[[Tony Blair]], who welcomed Israel's decision to ease the restrictions on behalf of the [[Quartet on the Middle East]], said that the Quartet – the UN, US, EU, and Russia – would continue talks with Israel "to flesh out the principles". Suggesting that "items of ordinary daily life, including materials for the construction of homes, infrastructure and services as the UN have asked" should be allowed to enter Gaza, he stated that "the decision to allow foodstuffs and household items is a good start". <ref name="JPost Ease">{{cite news|journal=Jerusalem Post|title=Israel to ease Gaza restrictions|date=17 June 2010|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=178720|accessdate=18 June 2010}}</ref> A spokesperson for the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] declared that the Secretary-General would be encouraged that the Israeli government is reviewing its policy towards Gaza. He added that the United Nations would continue to seek a fundamental change in policy as agreed by the Quartet. Hamas spokesperson [[Sami Abu Zuhri]] said that Israel's decision would have been designed to "beautify" the blockade and mislead public opinion. <ref name="Guardian Easing">{{cite news|last=Black|first=Ian|journal=Guardian|title=Israel's partial easing of Gaza blockade dismissed as inadequate|date=17 June 2010|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jun/17/israel-gaza-blockade-partial-easing|accessdate=18 June 2010 | location=London}}</ref><ref name="JPost UN">{{cite news|last1=Toameh|first1=Khaled Abu|last2=JPost.com staff|journal=Jerusalem Post|title=UN welcomes blockade decision|date=17 June 2010|url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=178806|accessdate=18 June 2010}}</ref> . 

A [[British Foreign Office]] spokesman said: "It is good that Israel is giving serious consideration to resolving these issues, [b]ut further work is needed. We need to see the additional steps still to be announced." EU officials also said they were disappointed by the decision. <ref name="Guardian Easing"/> German [[Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development|Minister of Economic Cooperation and Development]] [[Dirk Niebel]] said that the Israeli announcement was "not sufficient". During a visit to the country, Niebel intended to visit a sewage treatment plant being financed with German development aid, but was denied entry into the Gaza strip by Israel. He commented that the Israeli government sometimes would "not make it easy for its friends to explain why it behaves the way it does."<ref>{{cite news|journal=Haaretz|title=Israel bars German minister from Gaza|date=19 June 2010|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-bars-german-minister-from-gaza-1.297107|accessdate=20 June 2010}}</ref> A spokesperson for Israel's Foreign Ministry responded that Israel would have been obliged to allow any other European minister entry if it had allowed Niebel to visit the Gaza strip, thus conferring additional legitimacy to the Hamas government. <ref name="FAZ Niebel">{{cite news|journal=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|title=Israel verweigert Niebel Einreise in Gazastreifen|date=20 June 2010|url=http://www.faz.net/s/RubB30ABD11B91F41C0BF2722C308D40318/Doc~EC7D4C64B72FD48BA8D6156E63AF7E5F1~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html|accessdate=20 June 2010|quote="Wenn wir Niebel die Einreise erlaubt hätten, müssten wie sie auch jedem anderen europäischen Minister gestatten.

This would confer additional legitimacy to the Hamas government," a spokesperson for the Israeli Foreign Ministry told the Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung.)</ref> . 

Chris Gunness from [[UNRWA]] criticised Israel's move to ease the blockade as not being adequate, saying that "Even if the blockade is eased it remains illegal under international law as it is a collective form of punishment on a civilian population. Eighty percent of Gaza's population is aid-dependent. Allowing more aid in is perpetuating this dependency and not addressing the issue of self- sufficiency or the root causes of the crisis. What have not been addressed by the easing of the closure are the issues of exports as well as the limited number of crossings open to facilitate the flow of goods. Operation Cast Lead destroyed at least 60,000 homes and structures which need to be urgently repaired and rebuilt. The easing of the blockade is not addressing this adequately."<ref name="easing1">{{cite news|journal=IPS|title=Israel Chokes Gaza Despite Announced Easing|date=15 July 2010|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=52161}}</ref> . 

Maxwell Gaylard, UN Deputy Special and Humanitarian Coordinator for the Middle East also criticised Israel, saying "Permitting mayonnaise and potato chips into Gaza is really irrelevant in dealing with the underlying issues. What we need to see is an improvement in Gaza's water, sanitation, power grid, educational and health sectors. Gaza's economy is shot to pieces and its infrastructure is extremely fragile."<ref name="easing1" /> . 

===New blockade policy by Israel===. 
On 20 June 2010, Israel's Security Cabinet approved a new system governing the blockade that would allow practically all non-military or dual-use items to enter the Gaza strip. According to a cabinet statement, Israel would "expand the transfer of construction materials designated for projects that have been approved by the Palestinian Authority, including schools, health institutions, water, sanitation and more – as well as (projects) that are under international supervision."<ref name="Ynet Cabinet"/> Despite the easing of the land blockade, Israel will continue to inspect all goods bound for Gaza by sea at the port of [[Ashdod]]. <ref name="JTA Reaction mixed">{{cite news|last=Oster|first=Marcy|publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|title=Reaction mixed to Israeli announcement on easing of Gaza blockade|date=21 June 2010|url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/06/21/2739697/israel-announces-plan-to-ease-gaza-blockade|accessdate=21 June 2010}}</ref> .

===Lieberman Proposal===. 
In July 2010, Israel's foreign minister [[Avigdor Lieberman]] proposed an initiative to shift full responsibility over the Gaza Strip to the international community. He announced that he plans to discuss the idea, which was labeled a "personal initiative" with the EU Foreign Minister [[Catherine Ashton]]. <ref>“Let Gaza go” – Israeli Foreign Minister. The Voice of Russia, 16 July 2010 [http://english.ruvr.ru/2010/07/16/12542079.html]</ref> . 

Lieberman proposed that units of the [[French Foreign Legion]] and commando units from EU member states be sent in to secure the Gaza border crossings to prevent the smuggling of weapons, and that the border with Israel be sealed. Ships that underwent inspections in [[Cyprus]] or [[Greece]] would be allowed to dock in Gaza and unload humanitarian cargoes. The EU would help improve and build civilian infrastructure, and Gaza would become a fully independent entity. <ref>FM presents: 2nd disengagement from Gaza, Shimon Shiffer, Ynet 16 July 2010 [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3920724,00.html]</ref> . 

===Humanitarian impact assessment===. 
In January and February 2011, the [[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] (UNOCHA) conducted an assessment of the effects of the measures to ease the access restrictions. <ref name=ocha201103>{{cite web|title=Easing the blockade – Assessing the humanitarian impact on the population of the Gaza Strip|url=http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_special_easing_the_blockade_2011_03_english.pdf|publisher=UNITED NATIONS Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs occupied Palestinian territory|accessdate=16 July 2011|date=March 2011}}</ref> They concluded that they did not result in a significant improvement in people’s livelihoods. <ref name=ocha201103/> . 

They found that a limited reactivation of the private sector resulted from the increased availability of consumer goods and some raw materials but the "pivotal nature of the remaining restrictions" and the effects of three years of strict blockade prevented a significant improvement in livelihoods. <ref name=ocha201103/> Although the unemployment rate in Gaza fell from 39.3% to 37.4% in the second half of 2010 there were significant food price rises. <ref name=ocha201103/> There was little or no improvement in food insecurity rates in Gaza which continued to affect 52% of the population. <ref name=ocha201103/> Few of the 40,000 housing units needed to replace homes lost during [[Operation Cast Lead]] and for natural population growth could be built as a result of the ongoing restrictions on importing building materials. <ref name=ocha201103/> The approval of over 100 projects funded by international organizations intended to improve the "extremely deteriorated" water and sanitation, education and health services, followed the easing of the blockade. <ref name=ocha201103/> The implementation of these projects was delayed by the entry approval process for materials and the limited opening of the Karni crossing. <ref name=ocha201103/> OCHA found that there had been no improvement in the quality of services provided to the population of the Gaza Strip as a result of the projects so far. <ref name=ocha201103/> There was no significant increase in the number of exit permits granted by Israel to allow access to the outside world including other parts of the Palestinan territories. <ref name=ocha201103/> Permits continued to be issued by Israel only on a exceptional basis with a 114 being issued during the second half of 2010. <ref name=ocha201103/> OCHA described Egypt’s move to regularly operate its crossing with Gaza for special categories of people as a "significant, albeit limited, improvement". <ref name=ocha201103/>  . 

They concluded that the easing of restrictions was "a step in the right direction" but called on Israel to fully abolish the blockade including removing restrictions on the import of construction materials and the exports of goods, and to lift the general ban on the movement of people between Gaza and the West Bank via Israel in order to comply with what they described as international humanitarian and human rights law obligations. <ref name=ocha201103/> . 

== Further easing (2011-2012)==. 
Following the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011]], the new Egyptian leadership opened the [[Rafah crossing]] to the Gaza Strip on 28 May 2011, for women, children and men over 40. <ref name=BBCMAY28 /> Men aged between 18 and 40 require a permit and trade is prohibited. <ref name=BBCMAY28 /> Palestinians leaving Gaza are required to carry ID cards issued by Israel. <ref name=BBCMAY28 /> Israel criticised the opening citing security concerns. <ref name=BBCMAY28 /> However, little changed in reality, and there were still severe restrictions on movements to and from Gaza.  . 

In 2012 Egypt started supplying fuel to the Gaza Strip, to help ease a lengthy fuel crisis arising from a dispute between Egypt and the Hamas government in Gaza over whether Gaza can trade with Egypt openly, or only via Israel. <ref>{{cite news |title=
Egypt helps ease Gaza oil crisis |author= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17487388 |newspaper=BBC News |date=2012-03-23 |accessdate=2012-03-25}}</ref> . 

==Land blockade==. 
The [[Israel and Egypt–Gaza Strip barrier]], built by Israel between 1994 and 2005 when it had full control of the Gaza Strip, separates the Gaza Strip from both Egypt and Israel; the Israeli Defense Forces maintain a presence at all border crossings and regularly patrol along the fence. All humanitarian aid bound for Gaza via Israel is transferred through four border crossings: The [[Kerem Shalom]], [[Karni crossing|Karni]], [[Erez crossing|Erez]], and [[Sufa, Israel|Sufa]] crossings. All aid first undergoes security inspection before being transferred by truck into Gaza.  . 

Additionally, the [[Egypt-Gaza barrier]] was build underground by Egypt starting in 2009. The stated aim was to block smuggling tunnels, and the Egyptian Border Police maintains a presence along the Egypt-Gaza border. The [[Rafah Border Crossing]] is the only lawful crossing point between Egypt and Gaza, and is manned by Palestinian Authority security forces and the [[European Union Border Assistance Mission Rafah]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eubam-rafah.eu/node/2301 |title=Operations &#124; EUBAM Rafah |publisher=Eubam-rafah.eu |accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref> All humanitarian supplies are transferred through Israel or Egypt via the land crossings after security inspection.  . 

The [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in the Egyptian parliament wished to open trade across the border with Gaza in 2012, a move said to be resisted by Egypt's [[Mohamed Hussein Tantawi|Tantawi]] government. <ref>{{cite news |title=Egypt's rulers resist Muslim Brotherhood's push to open Gaza border |author=Reuters  |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/egypt-s-rulers-resist-muslim-brotherhood-s-push-to-open-gaza-border-1.420035 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=2012-03-21 |accessdate=2012-03-22}}</ref> . 

===Goods blocked===. 
{{Main|Goods allowed/banned for import into Gaza}} . 

Israel allows limited [[humanitarian aid|humanitarian supplies]] from aid organizations into the Gaza Strip. According to the [[Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories]] of the Israel Defense Forces, in May 2010, this included over 1.5&nbsp;million litres of diesel fuel and gasoline, fruits and vegetables, wheat, sugar, meat, chicken and fish products, dairy products, animal feed, hygiene products, clothing and shoes. <ref name="IDF Spokesperson's Unit">{{cite web|url=http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/News/today/10/05/0503.htm |title=Summary of the weekly transfer of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip by the IDF Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (CoGAT)  |date=5 May 2010 |publisher=[[IDF Spokesperson's Unit]]}}</ref> .

In January, 2010, the Israeli group Gisha took Israeli authorities to court, forcing them to reveal which goods were permitted and which goods weren't. The Israeli government replied that canned fruit, fruit juices and chocolate are blocked, while at the same time canned meat, canned tuna, mineral water, [[tahini|sesame paste]], tea and coffee are allowed into the Gaza Strip. <ref>Franks, Tim. "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8654337.stm Details of Gaza blockade revealed in court case]," ''[[BBC News]]''. </ref> . 

According to the Failing Gaza after one year report by [[Amnesty International]] and other organisations cement, glass, steel, bitumen, wood, paint, doors, plastic pipes, metal pipes, metal reinforcement rods, aggregate, generators, high voltage cables and wooden telegraph poles are "high priority reconstruction materials currently with no or highly limited entry into Gaza through official crossings."<ref>http://www.amnesty.org.uk/uploads/documents/doc_20012.pdf</ref> A 2009 UN report by Kevin M. Cahill called the restrictions "Draconian", and said that reconstruction is halted because Israel does not permit the importation of steel, cement or glass, among other [[building materials]], and has restricted importation of [[lentil]]s, pasta, [[tomato paste]] and juice, as well as batteries for hearing aids for deaf children. He said that despite the restrictions UNRWA has been able to provide a basic food supply to over a million refugees in the Gaza Strip. He added that he "visited a food station where hundreds of displaced persons waited to collect their meager staples of rice, sugar, lentils and cooking oil. While this program may save people from starvation, it is a diet that does not prevent the highest level of [[anemia]] in the region, with alarming rates of childhood stunting due to inadequate nutrition."<ref name=UNGazaReport>http://www.un.org/ga/president/63/news/GazaReport.pdf</ref> .

===Tunnels===. 
[[Image:Smuggling Tunnel.jpg|thumb|right|Smuggling tunnel in Rafah, 2009]]
{{Main|Gaza Strip smuggling tunnels}} . 

The tunnels are mainly located at [[Rafah]] on the border of the Gaza Strip and Egypt. The tunnels connect the Egyptian town of [[Rafah]] with the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[refugee camp]] of [[Rafah]]. As a result of the blockade, these tunnels have become a vital supply artery for Gaza. <ref name=reuterstunnels/> . 

The tunnels are used for various purposes. They have been used to transport people (in and out) and commercial materials like medicine, food and clothes, cigarettes, alcohol, and vehicle parts into Gaza. <ref name="IDF strikes Gaza smuggling tunnel">''YNet News'': [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3895876,00.html "IDF strikes Gaza smuggling tunnel"]</ref><ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">''BBC News'': [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8650468.stm "Four Palestinians die in Gaza-Egypt 'tunnel collapse'"]</ref> Israel says they are used to smuggle illegal arms (including rockets, mortars and explosives) to Gaza militants. <ref name="IDF strikes Gaza smuggling tunnel"/><ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/> Often cars are sliced into four parts and transported across and re-assembled in Gaza. <ref name=reuterstunnels>al-Mughrabi, Nida.

According to a tunnel operator, Israel bombards tunnels from the air, while Egypt either pumps poisonous gases, water or detonates explosives to destroy the tunnels. During the Gaza war, Israel destroyed most of the tunnels, reducing their number to 150 (from 3000) as of late 2009. <ref name= reuterstunnels/>  Egypt is constructing an [[Egypt-Gaza barrier|underground steel barrier]] to prevent circumvention of the blockade through tunnels.  . 

===Effects of land blockade on Gaza===. 
There have been several reports and studies analysing the effect of the blockade on Gaza.  . 

In July, 2008, an [[UNRWA]] report on the situation in Gaza stated that "the number of households in Gaza below the consumption poverty line continued to grow, reaching 51.8 percent in 2007 (from 50.7 percent in 2006)". <ref>{{citation |title=Poverty in Gaza Hits "Unprecedented" Level |url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=43318 | publisher=IPS | first=Omid | last=Memarian |date=25 July 2008}}</ref> In the same year, a Palestinian Bureau of Statistics study concluded that 80% of families in Gaza were living below the poverty line. <ref>{{citation |title=Study shows 80% of families in Gaza live below poverty line |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-06-26-Gaza-poverty_N.htm |work=USA Today |date=May, 2008}}</ref> The CIA World Fact book places this figure at an estimated 70% for 2009. <ref>{{citation |title=CIA – The World Fact Book – Gaza Strip |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gz.html}}</ref> . 

A [[World Health Organisation]] assessment conducted in 2009 claimed that the level of anemia in babies (9–12 months) was as high as 65%, while a Socio-economic and Food Security Survey Report stated that 61% of Gazans are food insecure and reliant on humanitarian aid. Of those that are food insecure, 65% are children under 18 years. Lastly, a [[European Network of Implementing Development Agencies]] (EUNIDA) report notes that, because of the security buffer zone imposed around Gaza as part of the blockade, as of June 2009, 46% of agricultural land was either inaccessible or out of production. <ref>{{citation |title=Farming without Land, Fishing without Water: Gaza Agriculture Sector Struggles to Survive |url=http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/9A265F2A909E9A1D8525772E004FC34B |date=May, 2010}}</ref> . 

On 14 June 2010, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] noted that the increasing scarcity of items has led to rises in cost of goods while quality has fallen. <ref>{{cite web |author=Dwyer Arce|url=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/06/gaza-blockade-violates-international-law-icrc.php

}}</ref> There is also "an acute electricity crisis", where electricity supplies are "interrupted for seven hours a day on average". As a consequence, they note that public services, particularly health services, have suffered, posing "a serious risk to the treatment of patients". In addition, medical equipment is difficult to repair, and medical staff cannot leave to gain more training. Lastly, the ICRC note that sanitation is suffering, because construction projects lack the equipment needed, or the equipment is of poor quality. Only 60% of the population is connected to a sewerage collection system, with the rest polluting the Gaza aquifer. As a result, water is largely "unfit for consumption". <ref name="Gaza closure: not another year!">{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/palestine-update-140610 |title=Gaza closure: not another year! |publisher=Icrc.org |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=1 June 2010}}</ref> . 

A 25 May 2010 [[UNDP|United Nations Development Programme]] report stated that, as a result of the blockade, most of Gaza's manufacturing industry has closed, and unemployment stood at an estimated 40%, a decrease on previous years. The blockade has also prevented much needed construction, noting that almost "none of the 3,425 homes destroyed during Cast Lead have been reconstructed, displacing around 20,000 people". Less than 20% "of the value of the damages to educational facilities has been repaired", only "half of the damage to the power network has been repaired", "no repair has been made to the transport infrastructure", "a quarter of damaged farmland has been rehabilitated and only 40% of private businesses have been repaired". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/276B3267FDF0A0948525772D0051B669 |title=One year after report |publisher=United Nations Development Programme |date=24 May 2010}}</ref> . 

==Economic sanctions==. 
Following the implementation of the blockade, Israel halted all exports from the Gaza Strip. Israeli human rights organization [[Gisha]], the Legal Center for Freedom of Movement, obtained an Israeli government document which says "A country has the right to decide that it chooses not to engage in economic relations or to give economic assistance to the other party to the conflict, or that it wishes to operate using 'economic warfare,' ". <ref name="Frenkel-econowar"/> Sari Bashi, the director of Gisha, said that this showed that Israel wasn't imposing its blockade for its stated reasons of a security measure to prevent weapons from entering Gaza, but rather as collective punishment for the Palestinian population of Gaza. <ref name="Frenkel-econowar"/> . 

In November 2010, the Israeli government allowed Gaza to resume agricultural exports, while still banning industrial exports. Shortly afterward, Gazan farmers began exporting [[strawberry|strawberries]], [[Bell pepper|peppers]], [[carnation]]s, and [[cherry tomato]]es. The exports travel to Europe via Israel, and Israel then transfers the money to agricultural cooperatives, which in turn pay the Palestinian farmers. The exports were implemented with aid from the [[Netherlands]], which was monitored by the Israeli defense establishment. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4035850,00.html |title=Gaza starts exporting tomatoes – Israel Business, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref> . 

==Naval blockade==. 
Israel has combined the Israeli and Egyptian blockade of Gaza's land borders with a maritime blockade of Gaza's port and coastline by the [[Israeli Navy]]. Israeli [[patrol boat]]s permanently patrol Gaza’s coastline and routinely fire on Palestinian fishing vessels who go more than 6 nautical miles from shore. <ref name="jps">{{cite journal|last=Butler|first=Linda|year=2009|title=GAZA AT A GLANCE|journal=Journal of Palestine Studies|publisher=University of California Press|volume=38|issue=3.

[[Cynthia McKinney]] and [[Mairead Maguire]] were captured by Israel attempting to sail to Gaza and deported. The supplies McKinney and Maguire were carrying on board were later delivered to Gaza over land by truck.  . 

Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] has said that Turkish warships will escort Turkish boats bringing humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. <ref>Enginsoy, Ümit.

===Effect on the fishing industry===. 
[[File:Al Jazeera - Gaza Fishing.ogv|thumb|300px|Al Jazeera report on the effects on the fishing industry]]
The sea blockade has caused damage to Gaza fishing industry. Palestinian fishing was originally to be permitted up to {{convert|20|nmi|km}} offshore under the 1994 [[Gaza-Jericho agreement]]. <ref name="jps"/> The agreement wasn't implemented and Israel allows fishermen to travel only {{convert|3|nmi|km}} offshore, reduced from {{convert|6|nmi|km|abbr=on}} in 2007. Israeli officials say the restrictions are necessary because of past incidents of Palestinians using fishing boats for smuggling and attacks. One fisherman who went outside these limits was forced to strip down to his underwear and swim to a naval vessel. <ref name= fishermen/> He was blindfolded, handcuffed and taken in for questioning. The Israeli Navy's response was that it was checking for weapons. The Navy reports they intercepted the craft entering Gaza from Egypt. B'Tselem has released a report documenting the "continual shooting at, abuse of, and humiliation of" Palestinian fishermen. <ref name=fishermen>{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/830452.html |title=Report: Israel Navy harassing and humiliating Gaza fishermen |date=26 February 2007 |publisher=[[Haaretz]]/[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> . 

According to the Fishing Under Fire Report 2009,<ref>[http://fishingunderfire.blogspot.com/2010/01/fishing-under-fire-report-2009.html Fishing Under Fire Report 2009]</ref> since the declaration of the "ceasefire"(18 January 2009), till the end of 2009: . 

– 1 fisherman was killed by naval gunfire.  . 

– at least 7 fishermen have been injured by naval gunfire and at least another one sustained burns after shelling in the sea, while another fisherman was reported by several media to be lightly injured by gunfire, but his name wasn't reported.  . 

– at least 6 Palestinian civilians were injured on shore by Israeli Naval gunfire (among them 4 children) and several others have been reportedly injured (among them another 5 fishermen have been reportedly injured on shore by Israeli shelling) . 

– 68 arrests of fishermen have been reported (at least 2 fishermen arrests twice) and 29 "confiscations" of fishing boats. Several fishing boats have been returned but with damages and equipment missing, and at least one hassaka (small fishing boat) was confiscated again.  . 

– 1 Greek boat of the Free Gaza Movement ("Spirit of Humanity", official name "Arion") was seized and confiscated and all the 21 passengers and crew detained and later deported.  . 

The [[UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] has estimated that Gaza fishermen need to journey at least 12–15 nautical miles from shore to catch larger shoals, and sardines in particular are {{convert|6|nmi|km|abbr=on}} offshore. Shoals closer to shore have been depleted. The total catch pre-blockade in 1999 was nearly 4,000 tons, this was reduced to 2,700 tons in 2008. In the 90s, the Gaza fishing industry was worth $10&nbsp;million annually or 4% of the total Palestinian economy; this was halved between 2001 and 2006. 45,000 Palestinians were employed in the fishing industry, employed in jobs such as catching fish, repairing nets and selling fish. Fish also provided much-needed animal protein to Gazans' diet. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0701/p06s02-wome.html |title=How Israel's naval blockade denies Gazans food, aid |publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |first=Mel |last=Frykberg}}</ref> . 

The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] also notes that "90% of Gaza's 4000 fishermen are now considered either poor (with a monthly income of between 100 and 190 US dollars) or very poor (earning less than 100 dollars a month), up from 50% in 2008." Nezar Ayyash, head of Gaza's fishermen's union, is quoted as saying that he has been arrested and his boat confiscated several times. <ref name="Gaza closure: not another year!"/> . 

==Energy restrictions==. 
Almost all of Gaza's liquid fuel and about half of its electricity are supplied by Israel, while Gaza's sole power plant runs on crude diesel supplied by Israel. In late October 2007, in response to persistent rocket fire on Southern Israel, the [[Security Cabinet of Israel]] decided to cut diesel exports to Gaza by 15% and gasoline exports by 10%, and to create targeted electrical outages for 15 minutes after a rocket attack. According to Israeli officials, the energy flow to hospitals and Israeli shipments of crude diesel to Gaza's sole power plant would remain unaffected. The Israeli government argued that these limited energy cuts are a non-violent way to protest against Hamas rocket attacks. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7068239.stm |title=BBC NEWS &#124; Middle East &#124; Israel's Gaza fuel cuts alarm UN |publisher=BBC  |date=29 October 2007 |accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref> .

==Debate==. 
{{main|Reactions to the Gaza flotilla raid}} . 

===Egyptian arguments===. 
Egypt's argument is that it cannot open Rafah crossing unless the Palestinian Authority headed by [[Mahmoud Abbas]] controls the crossing and international monitors are present. Egypt Foreign Minister [[Ahmed Aboul Gheit]] said Hamas wants the border opened because it would represent Egyptian recognition of the group's control of Gaza. "Of course this is something we cannot do," he said, "because it would undermine the legitimacy of the Palestinian Authority and consecrate the split between Gaza and the West Bank."<ref name="egypt">{{cite news|title=The Associated Press|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/egypt-fm-hamas-gave-israel-the-excuse-to-launch-gaza-attacks-1.267251|newspaper=The Associated Press}}</ref> . 

Following the events of the [[Gaza flotilla raid]] in May 2010, after Egypt opened its borders with Gaza, it was reported that former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was caught between the need to appease growing public anger at Israel's actions and the necessity of maintaining his close relationship with Israel. This friendship was needed to secure more than $2bn of American aid annually, money on which many analysts believe Mubarak's regime depended on. <ref name="mubarakopen"/> . 

===Israeli arguments===. 
In September 2007, citing an intensification of [[Qassam rocket]] attacks, [[Israel]] prevented the transfer of electricity, fuel, and other supplies into [[Gaza]]. Israel stated that the purpose of the blockade was to pressure [[Hamas]] into ending the rocket attacks and to deprive them of the supplies necessary for the continuation of rocket attacks. <ref>{{cite news|title=Israel Pressures Hamas Ahead of Rice’s Arrival|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/20/world/middleeast/20mideast.html?scp=3&sq=Gaza+fuel+Qassam&st=nyt|work=New York Times|date=19 September 2007 | first1=Steven | last1=Erlanger | first2=Helene | last2=Cooper | accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Israel declares Gaza 'hostile territory'|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/09/19/africa/mideast.php|publisher=[[International Herald Tribune|IHT]]|date=19 September 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Cabinet declares Gaza 'hostile territory'|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/905561.html|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|date=20 September 2007}}</ref><ref name="MFA Gaza">[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Templates/ArticleDynamicFix.aspx?NRMODE=Published&NRORIGINALURL=%2fMFA%2fGovernment%2fCommuniques%2f2007%2fSecurity%2bCabinet%2bdeclares%2bGaza%2bhostile%2bterritory%2b19-Sep-2007%2ehtm&NRNODEGUID=%7bC93011D3-18EA-4EEB-84C1-717072E4071A%7d&NRCACHEHINT=Guest Security Cabinet declares Gaza hostile territory] by [[Israel Foreign Affairs Ministry|MFA]]</ref> Israel argues that it is not legally responsible for [[Gaza]] beyond whatever is necessary to avoid a humanitarian crisis. <ref name=sanctions_legal/> . 

A US Congressional Research Service report claimed 'While there are differing views in Israel concerning the Gaza blockade [...] most Israelis equate security with survival and peace. Israel’s leaders appear to believe that the blockade of the Gaza Strip [among other security and deterrence measures], have brought about a quiet ... As of the date of the Gaza flotilla incident, no Israeli had been killed in a terrorist or in a cross-border rocket attack in more than a year. Therefore, the Israeli government is reluctant to abandon the blockade tactic worked ... from its perspective.'<ref name="crs">[[Congressional Research Service]], 23 June 2010: [http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/R41275_20100623.pdf CRS Report for Congress: Israel’s Blockade of Gaza, the Mavi Marmara Incident, and Its Aftermath], pp. 4–5</ref> . 

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintained that the blockade is necessary to prevent weapons from reaching Gaza. He said, “(I)t’s our obligation—as well as our right in accordance to international law and to common sense—to prevent these weapons
from entering by air, sea, and land.” Referring to the [[Gaza flotilla]], he added, “Had the blockade been breached, this flotilla would have been followed by dozens, by hundreds of ships. The amount of weapons that can be transported aboard a ship is totally different from what we saw get through the tunnels.”. He argued that the consequences of Israel’s failure to maintain the blockade would be “an Iranian port in Gaza, only a few dozen kilometers from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.”<ref name="crs"/> . 

An Israeli government document stated, <blockquote>A country has the right to decide that it chooses not to engage in economic relations or to give economic assistance to the other party to the conflict, or that it wishes to operate using 'economic warfare'. <ref name="Frenkel-econowar">{{cite news |author=Sheera Frenkel |title=Israeli document: Gaza blockade isn't about security |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/06/09/95621/israeli-document-gaza-blockade.html |publisher=[[McClatchy Newspapers]] |date=9 June 2010 |accessdate=10 June 2010}}</ref></blockquote> An Israeli government spokesman added in 2010 that the blockade is intended to bring about a political goal and that Israel "could not lift the embargo altogether as long as Hamas remains in control" of Gaza. <ref name="Frenkel-econowar" /> .

According to US diplomatic cables obtained by the [[Wikileaks]] organization, diplomats stationed in the US embassy in Tel Aviv were briefed by Israelis on the blockade of the Gaza Strip. One of the cables states that "as part of their overall embargo plan against Gaza, Israeli officials have confirmed (...) on multiple occasions that they intend to keep the Gazan economy on the brink of collapse without quite pushing it over the edge". <ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE7041GH20110105 Israel said would keep Gaza near collapse: WikiLeaks (Reuters, 5 January 2011)]</ref> . 

===Legal arguments=== . 

According to [[Princeton University]] professor emeritus of international law [[Richard Falk]], there exists an "overwhelming consensus" view among qualified international law specialists that both the blockade and its enforcement are illegal. <ref name=RFALK>[http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/09/2011978161147706.html Deep flaws in the UN's Mavi Marmara report (Al Jazeera, Sept. 9, 2001)]</ref>  . 

In September 2011, a UN investigative committee concluded in the [[Gaza flotilla raid#UN Palmer Report|Palmer Report]] that the blockade is legal. <ref name="nytimes-palmer"/><ref name="un-palmer"/><ref name="jpost.com"/>  . 

The findings of the Palmer report on the legality of the blockade were disputed by a panel of five UN human rights experts, who said that the blockade amounted to a "flagrant contravention of international human rights and humanitarian law". <ref name=REUTERS913 /> The panel said the Palmer report failed to recognize that the naval blockade was part of Israel's closure policy toward Gaza, which disproportionately affects civilians. Richard Falk said the authors of the Palmer report were poorly qualified to assess legal aspects of the blockade,<ref name=RFALK /> and that they were politically motivated to find the naval blockade legal. <ref name=REUTERS913>[http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/13/us-un-gaza-rights-idUSTRE78C59R20110913 U.N. experts say Israel's blockade of Gaza illegal (Reuters, Sept. 13, 2011)]</ref> . 

Since 2005 Israel asserts that it ended its occupation of Gaza when it [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|disengaged from the coastal strip in 2005]]. <ref>[http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DRIT=1&DBID=1&LNGID=1&TMID=111&FID=443&PID=0&IID=2021&TTL=International_Law_and_Gaza:_The_Assault_on_Israel’s_Right_to_Self-Defense International Law and Gaza: The Assault on Israel's Right to Self-Defense], [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], Vol. 7, No. 29, 28 January 2008. </ref><ref>[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Speeches+by+Israeli+leaders/2008/Address+by+FM+Livni+to+the+8th+Herzliya+Conference+22-Jan-2008.htm?DisplayMode=print Israeli MFA Address by Israeli Foreign Minister Livni to the 8th Herzliya Conference], [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)]], 22 January 2008. </ref> After [[Israel's unilateral disengagement|Israel's unilateral disengagement plan]] from the Gaza strip, Israel no longer has troops stationed within Gaza. Israel has retained control over Gaza's airspace and coastline, and over its own border with the territory. Egypt has control of its border with Gaza. Israel and Egypt also control the flow of goods in and out.  Israel controls fuel imports to Gaza, and also controls the majority of electricity used in Gaza (approximately 60%), which it supplies from the Israeli electrical grid. <ref name=sanctions_legal/><ref>Israel court backs Gaza fuel cuts [http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3012543120071130?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%253A+reuters%252FworldNews+%28News+%252F+US+%252F+International%29], 30 November 2007</ref> There have been a series of attacks by Israeli ground forces such as the [[2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict]], as well as [[Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel|rocket attacks]] on Israeli civilians and cross-border attacks by Gazan militant groups against Israeli troops.  . 

[[Human Rights Watch]] argues that Israel is still an occupying power and is responsible for Gaza under the ''1949 Fourth Geneva Convention'', which seeks to protect the civilian population. <ref name=sanctions_legal/> . 

BBC's World Affairs correspondent [[Paul Reynolds (BBC journalist)|Paul Reynolds]] said that if [[Gaza]] is treated as a "hostile entity" the question is whether the measures used by Israel and Egypt sufficiently distinguish between civilian and military. The [[Geneva Conventions|1977 amendment to the Geneva Conventions protocols]] prohibits the use of collective measures that do not distinguish between civilians and military. <ref name=sanctions_legal/> The amendment protects civilian populations in time of conflicts that fall short of war. Israel has not signed these protocols but there is an expectation internationally that it should respect them. <ref name=sanctions_legal/>  [[Hamas]] does not administer an internationally recognized state and also has not signed these protocols. Amnesty International said that “The blockade constitutes collective punishment under international law and must be lifted immediately.” And that as the occupying power, Israel has a duty under international law to ensure the welfare of Gaza’s inhabitants, including their rights to health, education, food and adequate housing. <ref>Amnesty International Israel's Gaza blockade continues to suffocate daily life 18 January 2010 [http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/israel039s-gaza-blockade-continues-suffocate-daily-life-20100118]</ref> . 

[[Justus Weiner]] and [[Avi Bell]] of the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs|JCPA]] said that Israel’s combat actions and blockade cannot be considered collective punishment. They cite Article 75(4)(b) of Protocol I Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, which says the bar on collective punishment forbids the imposition of criminal-type penalties on individuals or groups on the basis of another’s guilt, or the commission of acts that would otherwise violate the rules of distinction and/or proportionality. <ref>[http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DBID=1&TMID=111&LNGID=1&FID=573&PID=0&IID=4195 Israel’s Naval Blockade of Gaza Is Legal, Necessary 10/6/2010]</ref> According to Weiner and Bell, the blockade does not "involve the imposition of criminal-type penalties or the violation of the rules of distinction and proportionality."<ref name="weiner">Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, International Law and the Fighting in Gaza, Justus Reid Weiner and Avi Bell, 2008, [http://www.jcpa.org/text/puzzle1.pdf]</ref> . 

===International positions===. 
==== United Nations ====. 
On 24 January 2008, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] released a statement calling for Israel to lift its siege on the Gaza Strip, allow the continued supply of food, fuel, and medicine, and reopen border crossings. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/7A7B2B76C0F3C3F6C12573DA00529096?opendocument |title=SIXTH SPECIAL SESSION OF HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL CONCLUDES WITH CALL ON ISRAEL TO END SIEGE IMPOSED ON OCCUPIED GAZA STRIP |publisher=United Nations |date=24 January 2008 |accessdate=4 June 2010}}</ref>  According to the [[Jerusalem Post]], this was the 15th time in less than two years the council condemned Israel for its human rights record regarding the Palestinian territories. <ref name="UNHRCslams">{{cite news | url = http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1201070783680&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull | title = UNHRC slams Israel's actions in Gaza | work=The Jerusalem Post | date=25 January 2008 }}</ref> The proceedings were boycotted by Israel and the United States. Prior to this, U.N. Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, [[John Holmes (British diplomat)|John Holmes]], described the blockade as "collective punishment", saying, "We all understand the security problems and the need to respond to that but collective punishment of the people of Gaza is not, we believe, the appropriate way to do that."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN18343083 | title = Collective punishment for Gaza is wrong -U.N. |agency=Reuters   | date=18 January 2008 | first=Louis | last=Charbonneau}}</ref> .

In March 2010, [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-Moon]] stated that the blockade of Gaza is causing "unacceptable suffering" and that families were living in "unacceptable, unsustainable conditions". <ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8578611.stm |title=UN chief says Gaza suffering under Israeli blockade |date=21 March 2010 |accessdate=21 March 2010 |publisher=BBC }}</ref> . 

A  UN Fact Finding mission in September 2009 led by South African Judge [[Richard Goldstone]] (the [[Goldstone report]]) concluded that the blockade was possibly a [[crime against humanity]], and recommended that the matter be referred to the [[International Criminal Court]] if the situation has not improved in six months.  .

In June 2010, United Nations envoy to the Middle East and former UK Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] stated that "The policy of Gaza is counter-productive and what [Israel] should be doing is allow material in to rebuild homes and sanitation and power and water systems and allow business to flourish. Nor do we in fact do damage to the position of Hamas by harming people in Gaza. People are harmed when the quality of service is poor and people cannot work."

====European Union====. 
EU [[European Commissioner for International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response|Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid]] [[Kristalina Georgieva]], said that she believes that the "humanitarian crisis...was artificially created because of the [Israeli] blockade," but added that the idea of a [[Gaza flotilla raid|flotilla]] is not the correct action to take: "We are not in favor of attempts to help people in this way."<ref>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4070269,00.html EU official: No restrictions – no Gaza crisis]</ref> .

Turkish Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] made harsh comments against the blockade, especially following the [[Gaza flotilla raid]]. Erdoğan raised the possibility of trying to forcibly breach the blockade by sending the [[Turkish Navy]] to escort any future flotilla or by trying to visit Gaza himself. The Turkish government made it clear that it opposes the blockade and regards it as illegal, and before the flotilla raid, issued a demand for safe passage. However, Turkish Foreign Minister [[Ahmet Davutoğlu]] said that Turkey was willing to normalize relations with Israel if it lifted the blockade. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3898032,00.html |title=Turkey to normalize Israel ties if Gaza blockade ends – Israel News, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref> Following Israel's easing of the blockade, the Turkish Foreign Ministry called it "a positive but insufficient step", and said that "Turkey considers that Israel's inhuman blockade of Gaza represents a threat to regional peace and stability and considers that the blockade must be entirely lifted. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=turkey-says-israels-easing-of-gaza-blockade-insufficient-2010-06-23 |title=Turkey says Israel's easing of Gaza blockade 'insufficient' – Hurriyet Daily News and Economic Review |publisher=Hurriyetdailynews.com |accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref> .

After visiting Gaza in March 2010, Irish foreign minister [[Micheál Martin]] described the Israeli blockade of Palestinian-ruled Gaza as "inhumane and unacceptable" and called on the [[European Union]] and other countries to increase pressure on Israel to lift the blockade. Michael Martin was the first EU foreign minister to enter Gaza in over a year.

====Groups and individuals====. 
On 7 March 2008, several international aid groups, including [[Amnesty International]], [[CARE International|CARE International UK]], and [[Oxfam]], issued a report saying that the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip was more acute than at any time since the beginning of the Israeli occupation in 1967. While critical of Palestinian militants firing rockets from Gaza into Israel, and acknowledging that "Israel has the right and obligation to protect its citizens", they said that as the "occupying power in Gaza" it also has a legal duty to ensure Gaza civilians have access to food, clean water, electricity and medical care. They urged Israel to lift the blockade, characterizing it as [[collective punishment]] against the 1.5&nbsp;million residents of the territory. <ref>{{cite news|title=Human crisis in Gaza 'is worst for 40 years'|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |author=Tim Butcher|date=7 March 2008|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/03/06/wgaza106.xml }}</ref> . 

According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, "The hardship faced by Gaza's 1.5&nbsp;million people cannot be addressed by providing humanitarian aid. The only sustainable solution is to lift the closure." Describing the blockade itself, they referred to it as "a [[collective punishment]] imposed in clear violation of Israel's obligations under international humanitarian law". <ref name="Gaza closure: not another year!"/> . 

The [[Islamic Action Front]] (IAF), a [[Jordan]]ian [[Islamist]] group, criticized Egypt for the blockade and accused it of "collaborating" with Israel and the United States. "The Egyptian authorities are ...increasing the suffering of the Palestinians in Gaza by building the steel wall and closing the border crossings with Gaza," said Hamzah Mansour, a member of the Shura Council of the IAF. <ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2010-01/10/content_12786978.htm IAF slams Egypt's building of steel wall along borders with Gaza], 10 January 2010</ref> . 

Notable individuals have also taken positions on the blockade:
* [[Jimmy Carter]] – In June 2009, former President Jimmy Carter met with Hamas leaders in Gaza for three hours. Before his meeting with former Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh and other Hamas officials, President Carter spoke forcefully against the economic blockade of Gaza. "The responsibility for this terrible human rights crime lies in Jerusalem, Cairo, Washington, and throughout the international community. This abuse must cease; the crimes must be investigated; the walls must be brought down, and the basic right of freedom must come to you," Carter tells the crowd at an awards ceremony for UN refugee school pupils. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jun/16/carter-hamas-gaza-israel |work=The Guardian |location=London  | title=Carter challenges Gaza blockade as he meets Hamas leaders | first=Rory | last=McCarthy | date=16 June 2009 | accessdate=22 April 2010}}</ref>
* [[Pope Benedict XVI]] – The Pope Benedict during his visit to [[Bethlehem]] in May 2009 specifically mentioned the plight of Gazans, saying: "Please be assured of my solidarity with you in the immense work of rebuilding which now lies ahead and my prayers that the embargo will soon be lifted."<ref name="Prusher">{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0513/p06s13-wome.html |title=Pope's urging brings Gaza blockade to forefront |date=13 May 2009 |publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |first=Ilene R. |last=Prusher}}</ref> .
