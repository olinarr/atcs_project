The '''Gaza flotilla raid'''  was a military operation by Israel against [[Ships of Gaza flotilla raid|six ships]] of the "[[Gaza Freedom Flotilla]]" on 31 May 2010 in [[international waters]] of the Mediterranean Sea. The [[flotilla]], organized by the [[Free Gaza Movement]] and the Turkish [[IHH (Turkish NGO)|Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief]] (İHH), was carrying humanitarian aid and construction materials, with the intention of breaking the Israeli-Egyptian [[2007–present blockade of the Gaza Strip|blockade of the Gaza Strip]].  . 

On 31 May 2010, Israeli [[Shayetet 13]] naval commandos boarded the ships from speedboats{{sfn|UN Palmer Report|2011|p=19}} and helicopters in order to force the ships to the Israeli [[port of Ashdod]] for inspection. On the Turkish ship [[MV Mavi Marmara|MV ''Mavi Marmara'']], boarding faced resistance from about 40 IHH activists&nbsp;– described in a UN report as a "separate hardcore group"&nbsp;– who were armed with iron bars, dinner plates and knives.{{Sfn|UN Palmer Report|2011|pp=54–61}} During the struggle, nine activists were killed, and many were wounded. All activist casualties were caused by gunshots, some of them in point blank range. Ten of the commandos were also wounded, one of them seriously.{{Sfn|UN Palmer Report|2011|pp=54–61}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Kershner |first=Isabel |date=31 May 2010 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/01/world/middleeast/01flotilla.html |title=Deadly Israeli raid draws condemnation |work=The New York Times |accessdate=23 September 2011}}</ref> The five other ships in the flotilla employed [[passive resistance]], which was suppressed without major incident. The ships were towed to Israel, where all passengers were detained and deported.  . 

The raid drew widespread condemnation internationally and resulted in a deterioration of [[Israel-Turkey relations]]. Israel consequently eased its blockade on the Gaza Strip, all activists were freed, and the ships returned. In September 2011, a [[United Nations]] report, after analysis of both Turkey and Israeli national investigations, concluded that the Israeli blockade was legal, but that Israel army used excessive force in this incident by firing stun and smoke grenades from the Israeli army’s speed boats and helicopters before boarding into flotilla and conducted live fire rounds from the helicopters before or after boarding, though the flotilla was still in [[international waters]]. The report also mentioned "serious questions about the conduct, true nature and objectives of the flotilla organizers, particularly IHH."{{sfn|UN Palmer Report|2011|p=4}} . 

The government of Israel alleged that the flotilla was organized as a provocation or media stunt,<ref group="text" name="NY-Daily-News"/> and that a hard core of about 40 IHH activists were prepared from the beginning for a violent confrontation. <ref name="Guardian 2-6-10">{{cite news |last=Sherwood |first=Harriet |date=2 June 2010 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jun/02/flotilla-raid-turkish-jihadis-troops-israel-claims |title= Flotilla raid: Turkish jihadis bent on violence attacked troops, Israel claims |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=23 September 2011}}</ref> The ''[[New York Times]]'', in an editorial, asserted that "At least some of the activists on the lead ship, the Mavi Marmara, were seeking a confrontation&nbsp;– and got one."<ref name="NYTimes-ed">{{cite news |author=Editorial |date=11 June 2010 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/12/opinion/12sat3.html |title=What Happened on the Mavi Marmara? |work=The New York Times |accessdate=23 September 2011}}</ref>

Israeli Navy warships flanked the flotilla and an aircraft flew overhead after it ignored Israeli instructions. Speedboats were prevented from approaching the ''Mavi Marmara'' by throwing broken dishes and metal chains.{{Sfn|Lee raw footage video|2010|loc=36:30}} The other ships were boarded from speedboats. Israeli forces were met by passive resistance on five of the ships, but clashes broke out aboard the ''Mavi Marmara''. A team of 15 Israeli Shayetet 13 naval commandos [[abseil]]ed onto the ships from helicopters with paintball guns, plastic bullet riot dispersal handguns, and hidden firearms. The first team commander was thrown over the deck head down, abducted and stabbed, along with a second commando, and a third was grabbed off the rope. They were taken to an inside room and medically treated by the activists, who left the knife in the commander's stomach. A [[stun grenade]] from the abducted soldiers was thrown at the commandos and a handgun was allegedly taken from one soldiers and fired by an activist, who was intercepted. The commandos were ordered to use live fire. In the melee, five  activists were killed, and two, wounded by rubber bullets, died a short time later. <ref group="text">{{Harvnb|Lee raw footage video|2010}} begins with discussion of [[Haneen Zoabi]] Arab Israeli member of Israeli parliament.

Ahead of the operation, the soldiers were briefed by Vice-Admiral [[Eli Marom]], the commander of the Israeli Navy. Marom stated that the IDF had no intention of harming any flotilla passengers and would act professionally. He also warned soldiers that the passengers could provoke them in ways such as throwing cigarettes, spitting, and cursing, but that "we do not respond to these types of actions. We act as professional soldiers do". <ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yphfyN0dqi8 Israeli Navy Commander Vice Admiral Eliezer Marom Briefs Forces Set to Intercept Gaza Flotilla]&nbsp;– [[IDF Spokesperson's Unit]]</ref> . 

The Israeli Navy radioed Tural Mahmut, the captain of the ''Mavi Marmara'', sending him this message: "Mavi Marmara, you are approaching an area of hostilities, which is under a naval blockade. The Gaza coastal area and Gaza Harbour are closed to all maritime traffic. The Israeli government supports delivery of humanitarian supplies to the civilian population in Gaza Strip and invites you to enter [[Ashdod]] port. Delivery of supplies will be in accordance with the authorities' regulations and through the formal land crossing to Gaza and under your observation, after which you can return to your home ports aboard the vessels on which you arrived." The reply was: "Negative, negative. Our destination is Gaza." Shortly after, three Israeli warships began shadowing the flotilla. Two warships flanked the flotilla on either side, but at a distance. An Israeli aircraft also flew overhead. <ref name="aljazeera1"/> .

The IDF identified a group of some 50 men who were responsible for attacking IDF soldiers. The members of this group were not carrying identity cards or passports, but each carried an envelope with some $10,000 in cash.

Three Israeli commandos were captured. The first captured soldier, the commanding officer of the assault team, was abseiling from the helicopter when he was attacked by ten men before his feet hit the deck. He was beaten across his body and head, then picked up and thrown to the lower deck, where he was attacked by a dozen activists. They beat and choked him, removed his bulletproof vest and sidearm and smashed his helmet, and shoved him into a passenger hall below deck. The second soldier was surrounded by a team of fifteen to twenty activists in two groups. One group attacked him  when he landed on the ship's roof. He fired one shot at an activist holding a knife before being subdued. <ref name="Raved-2010"/> The activists seized his gun and beat him as he attempted to fight them off with his back to the hull. He was picked up by his arms and legs, and thrown over the hull. He attempted to hang on to the hull with both hands, but was forced to let go when activists beat his hands and pulled him down by his legs. He was then surrounded by another group of activists, stabbed in the stomach and was dragged into a lounge while being beaten. A third soldier who was lowered onto the deck saw an activist waiting to attack him with an iron crowbar. After shoving him away, he was attacked by four more activists, one of whom wrapped a chain around his neck and choked him until he lost consciousness. He was then thrown onto the bridge deck where he was attacked by about twenty activists, who beat him, cut away his equipment, and dragged him into the lounge.{{Sfn|Meir Amit report|2010|p=21}} The three soldiers were severely wounded and bleeding heavily. Two of the soldiers had their hands tied, and a third was unconscious and went into convulsions. During their captivity, they were subjected to physical and verbal abuse, and photographed and filmed.

Shortly afterward, a third helicopter arrived, carrying 14 soldiers. They successfully abseiled onto the ship, and the commander from the third helicopter met up with the commander from the second helicopter, after which the forces began moving towards the ship's bridge. They were attacked twice by activists, and responded with gunfire. The commandos reached the bridge after thirty minutes, and took command. Upon orders from the soldiers, the captain instructed all activists to enter their cabins. At this stage, most of the activists assembled on the sides of the ship retreated into the hull. The speedboats approached for a third time, and most of the remaining activists again hurled objects at the boats. Soldiers inside the boats then opened fire, taking careful aim to hit the resisting passengers and forcing the activists to disperse, enabling the soldiers to board from ladders.

One of the captive soldiers claimed that the activist guarding him waved to one of the IDF naval vessels to show that they were holding Israeli soldiers. At that point, he elbowed the activist in the ribs and jumped into the water, although the guard tried to hold him back.

===Detention of activists===. 
Following the boardings, Israeli naval forces towed the flotilla's vessels to Ashdod, from where the activists were taken into custody by authorities, pending deportation. <ref name="bbc-deaths as"/> . 

Some 629 activists were detained by the [[Israel Prison Service]], after they refused to sign deportation orders. A Turkish mother who had brought her one-year-old child with her agreed to extradition after she was advised that prison conditions were "too harsh" for her baby. <ref>{{cite web <!-- title revised from Israel detains dozens of Gaza flotilla activists upon arrival in Ashdod, original url was http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-detains-dozens-of-gaza-flotilla-activists-upon-arrival-in-ashdod-1.293339 --> |last1=Kyzer |first1=Liel |last2=Yair |first2=Ettinger |date=31 May 2010 |title='The ship turned into a lake of blood,' says activist on Gaza flotilla |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/the-ship-turned-into-a-lake-of-blood-says-activist-on-gaza-flotilla-1.293339 |work=Haaretz |accessdate=24 June 2011}}</ref> Irish [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Minister for Foreign Affairs]] [[Micheál Martin]] described the arrests as "kidnapping" and questioned the logic of bringing the detainees to Israel only to deport them there, instead of giving them "unconditional release". <ref name="Martin: Irish citizens 'kidnapped' in international waters">{{cite web|url=http://www.examiner.ie/breakingnews/ireland/martin-irish-citizens-kidnapped-in-international-waters-459870.html|title=Martin: Irish citizens 'kidnapped' in international waters|work=[[Irish Examiner]]|publisher=Thomas Crosbie Holdings|date=31 May 2010|accessdate=31 May 2010}}</ref> Israel planned to prosecute two dozen activists, charging they had assaulted its troops.

A group of thirteen female activists attacked Immigration Authority personnel accompanying them to the airport for deportation. The activists began to yell and curse while in the police bus taking them to the airport, cursing officers and Israel. When they arrived at the airport, two attacked an officer, trying to push, slap and scratch him while shouting "free Palestine" and "Israel is a terror state". The two were eventually restrained by several officers. <ref>{{cite web |last=Branovsky |first=Yael |date=2 June 2010 |title=Flotilla passengers attack immigration officers |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3898233,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=23 June 2011}}</ref> According to flotilla activist Fintan Lan Ken, an Irish-American passenger was beaten by security officials at the airport before boarding and had to be hospitalized. <ref>{{Cite news|newspaper=Irish Times |title=Activists claim Israeli officials beat them |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/0603/breaking16.html |date=3 June 2010}}</ref> . 

Arab [[Knesset]] Member [[Haneen Zoabi]] was released on 1 June. She attempted to address the Knesset, but was verbally abused by other lawmakers, who told her to "go to Gaza, traitor." She received multiple death threats by phone and mail, and was placed under armed protection after nearly 500 people signed up to a [[Facebook]] page calling for her execution. <ref name="guardian2"/> As a punitive measure, the Knesset stripped her of five parliamentary privileges: the right to carry a diplomatic passport, the right to financial assistance for legal expenses, the right to visit countries with which Israel does not have diplomatic relations, the right to participate in Knesset discussions, and the right to vote in parliamentary committees. A Knesset committee recommended that her parliamentary immunity be revoked, but Knesset Speaker [[Reuven Rivlin]] blocked the recommendation from being voted on.  . 

Four other [[Arab citizens of Israel|Israeli Arabs]] who participated in the flotilla were detained and later released on bail. On 3 June, the [[Ashkelon]] Magistrates' Court accepted an appeal for their release with bail, under the conditions that they remain under house arrest until 8 June, and do not leave the country for 45 days. <ref>Adalah, "[http://www.adalah.org/eng/pressreleases/pr.php?file=03_06_10 Magistrates' Court Orders Release of Detained Delegation of Arab Leaders from the Gaza Freedom Flotilla with Restrictive Conditions]", press release, 3 June 2010. </ref> . 

The Israeli nationals who were on board were investigated on suspicion of attempting to enter the Gaza Strip unlawfully. None of them were suspected of assaulting Israeli soldiers. In September 2011, [[Attorney General of Israel|Attorney-General]] [[Yehuda Weinstein]] ended the investigation. The [[Israeli Ministry of Justice|Israeli Justice Ministry]] stated that "after examining the overall evidence in the case and the legal issues pertaining to the matter, the attorney general has decided to close the case as a result of significant evidentiary and legal difficulties". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4165649,00.html |title=Flotilla case closed: Zoabi won't be charged |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=31 May 2010 |accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref> .

In Israel, the [[Israel Police]] and [[Israel Prison Service]] were placed on high alert throughout the country, residents of communities close to the border with the Gaza Strip were ordered to prepare their bomb shelters, and a number of checkpoints were set up along the Israel-Gaza Strip border. The IDF placed units along the northern and southern borders on alert, and called up reservists. Roads towards the [[Temple Mount]] in [[Jerusalem]] and other controversial areas were blocked by police. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-05/31/c_13325533.htm |title=Israel on high alert following Gaza flotilla showdown |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref> .

Three days later, Israel's Security Cabinet approved a new system governing the blockade that would allow practically all non-military or dual-use items to enter the Gaza strip.

Turkey's foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, reiterated his demands for a United Nations investigation.

====The Turkel Commission====. 
Following the raid, Israel's government set up the [[Turkel Commission]], a commission of inquiry headed by Israeli Supreme Court Justice [[Jacob Turkel]], to investigate the raid. It was chaired by Justice Turkel, and had four members: [[Shabtai Rosenne]], Professor of International Law at [[Bar-Ilan University]], [[Amos Horev]], a retired Israeli Major-General and President of the [[Technion|Technion Institute of Technology]], Miguel Deutch, Professor of Law at [[Tel Aviv University]], and Reuven Merhav, former Director-General of the Foreign Ministry. Rosenne died at age 93 during the Commission's work, and was not replaced. The commission had two non-voting foreign observers: Former [[First Minister of Northern Ireland]] and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[David Trimble]], and former [[Judge Advocate General (Canada)|Judge Advocate General]]  of the [[Canadian Forces]] [[Ken Watkin]], both of whom were friendly to Israel according to the BBC and Der Spiegel. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Steinvorth |first1=Daniel |last2=Schult |first2=Christoph |date=16 June 2010 |title=Smuggled Images of Israeli Assault: Gaza Raid Photos Fuel Propaganda War |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,700992,00.html |work=Spiegel Online International |accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Reynolds |first=Paul |date=14 June 2010 |title=Israel hopes inquiry will turn spotlight on activists |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10307637 |work=BBC  |accessdate=2 July 2011}}</ref> The Committee also contracted the services of two foreign international law experts: Professors Wolf Heintschel von Heineg and Michael Schmitt.  . 

The inquiry was charged with investigating the legality of the Gaza blockade, the legality of the Israeli Navy's actions during the raid, and determining whether investigations of claims of war crimes and breaches of international law conformed to Western standards. The Committee was also charged with investigating the Turkish position, and the actions taken by flotilla participants, especially the IHH, and examining the identities and intentions of the flotilla's participants.  . 

During the investigation, the Committee heard the testimonies of two flotilla passengers and two Israeli human rights activists. The Committee requested the assistance of the Turkish Embassy in Israel in finding the Captain of the ''Mavi Marmara'' so he could be invited to testify. The request was denied, with the response being that the Committee could look at the testimony of the Captain contained in the Turkish report. The Committee also issued an open invitation to all passengers and crew to testify, and requested assistance from the Turkish Embassy in Israel in building a list of prospective witnesses, but received no immediate reply. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?=191718 |title=Israel &#124; Jerusalem Post |work=Jerusalem Post  |date=21 November 2010 |accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref> The Committee also heard the testimonies of three politicians including the Prime Minister, three IDF officials (one testified twice), two government bureaucrats, and a Prison official.  . 

The 300-page Turkel Committee report{{sfn|Turkel Report Part 1 Overview|2011}} found the actions of the Israeli Navy in the raid and Israel's naval blockade of Gaza were both legal under international law,{{sfn|Turkel Report Summary|2011|p=9}}<ref name="BBCJAN232011" /> and accused a group of "IHH activists" of having armed themselves and conducting hostilities "in an organized manner".{{sfn|Turkel Report Part 1|2011|p=278}} . 

Turkey and Palestinian leader [[Mahmoud Abbas]] dismissed the Israeli investigation, and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon repeated the demand for an independent investigation, stating that the Israeli investigation will not have international credibility.  . 

====The Turkish Inquiry====. 
Turkey also established an inquiry into the events, which found, in contrast to the Israeli inquiry, the blockade and the Israeli raid to have been illegal. After the Turkish inquiry, Turkey described the raid as a violation of international law, "tantamount to banditry and piracy", and described the killings of activists as "state-sponsored terrorism". <ref name="BBCJAN232011"/> Concerning the Israeli inquiry, Turkey said its own commission was "surprised, appalled and dismayed that the national inquiry process in Israel has resulted in the exoneration of the Israeli armed forces". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/67836d6e-26f9-11e0-80d7-00144feab49a.html#axzz1BzBnW7u9 |title=Turkey and Israel clash over inquiries (Financial Times, 23 January 2011) |work=Financial Times  |accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref> .

In its first report, submitted in September 2010, the UN fact-finding mission found that the IDF broke international law, and that there was evidence sufficient to initiate prosecutions for breaches of the [[Geneva Convention]]. The report stated that: "The conduct of the Israeli military and other personnel towards the flotilla passengers was not only disproportionate to the occasion but demonstrated levels of totally unnecessary and incredible violence,"<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/> and determined that Israeli commandos summarily executed six passengers aboard the MV ''Mavi Marmara''. <ref name="Lynch-2010"/><ref name="unmultimedia.org"/> It cites forensic analysis indicating that Furgan Dogan was shot five times, including once in the face while he was lying on his back. "All of the entry wounds were on the back of his body except for the face wound, which entered the right of his nose", the report concluded. "According to forensic analysis, tattooing around the wound in his face indicates that the shot was delivered at point-blank range."<ref name="Lynch-2010"/> . 

The report stated: "There is clear evidence to support prosecutions of the following crimes within the terms of [[:s:Geneva Convention/Fourth Geneva Convention#Article 147|article 147]] of the Fourth Geneva Convention: wilful killing; torture or inhuman treatment; wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health". <ref name="bbc.co.uk"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Media.aspx|publisher=OHCHR Media Centre|title=UN Fact-finding Mission report on Gaza flotilla&nbsp;– Press Conference}}, 23 September 2010</ref> The report also stated that it found no medical evidence of IDF commandos being shot. <ref name="Lynch-2010"/> It recommended that Israel pay reparations, and also described Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip as "totally intolerable and unacceptable in the 21st century".  . 

The United States expressed concern about the tone, content and conclusions of the report, while the European Union said that it should be transferred to the UN Secretary-General's investigation. <ref>{{cite news|journal=Jerusalem Post|title=US concerned UNHRC flotilla probe may stop peace talks|date=28 September 2010|url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=189515|accessdate=28 September 2010}}</ref> On 29 September 2010 the UN Human Rights Council voted to endorse the report, with 30 of the 47 countries voting in favor, the United States voting against, and 15 countries, including EU members, abstaining. <ref name="Lynch-2010"/> .

The Panel was required to obtain its information from the two nations primarily involved in its inquiry, Turkey and Israel, and other affected States ... the limitation is important.

Of those killed, the report noted, "no evidence has been provided to establish that any of the deceased were armed with lethal weapons". It further noted that "at least one of those killed, Furkan Dogan, was shot at extremely close range. Mr. Dogan sustained wounds to the face, back of the skull, back and left leg. That suggests he may already have been lying wounded when the fatal shot was delivered, as suggested by witness accounts to that effect."

In regards to the [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip|Gaza blockade]], the commission writes:
<blockquote>"Israel faces a real threat to its security from militant groups in Gaza...The naval blockade was imposed as a legitimate security measure in order to prevent weapons from entering Gaza by sea and its implementation complied with the requirements of international law."<ref name=jpost1 /></blockquote> . 

The report was also critical of the flotilla, describing it as "reckless". Turkey was criticized as well for not doing more to persuade flotilla participants to avoid armed conflict with Israeli soldiers. <ref name=jpost1 /> Finally, the report presented the following as [[rapprochement]], i.e., for the re-establishment of cordial relations between Turkey and Israel:
<blockquote>"An appropriate statement of regret should be made by Israel in respect of the incident in light of its consequences.

====Other investigations====. 
Turkey's [[Bakırköy|Istanbul Bakırköy]] prosecutor's office, assisted by the [[Ankara]] prosecutor's office, has opened a criminal investigation. Possible charges, against Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], Defense Minister [[Ehud Barak]] and Chief of Staff [[Gabi Ashkenazi]], would include murder, injury, attacking Turkish citizens, and piracy. <ref>{{Cite news|title=Turkish prosecutors go after Israeli politicians |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-212202-turkish-prosecutors-go-after-israeli-politicians.html |newspaper=[[Today's Zaman]] |date=5 June 2010 |accessdate=30 June 2010}}</ref> A spokesman for the [[U.S. State Department]] said, "We will look into the circumstances of the death of an American citizen, as we would do anywhere in the world at all times", noting that the [[FBI]] could get involved, "working with the host government", "if we think a crime has been committed". <ref>{{Cite news |title=Gaza flotilla attack: US to investigate death of citizen |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/palestinianauthority/7801935/Gaza-flotilla-attack-US-to-investigate-death-of-citizen.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London  |date=3 June 2010 |accessdate=25 June 2011}}</ref> .

In May 2011, Istanbul state prosecutor Mehmet Akif Ekinci wrote to the [[Israeli Ministry of Justice|Israeli Justice Ministry]], demanding that it disclose the names and addresses of the soldiers who took part in the raid. The demand was reportedly based on the testimonies of over 500 activists aboard the ''Mavi Marmara''. There was no response to the request. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4134689,00.html |title=Turkey seeks Israeli arrests over flotilla raid |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4068368,00.html |title=Turkey demands names of soldiers involved in flotilla raid |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref> . 

In September 2011, IHH-affiliated lawyer Ramzan Turk claimed the organization had given Istanbul's chief prosecutor the names of ten Israeli soldiers involved in the raid. Turk claimed that the names were given to the IHH by IDF soldiers who did not take part in the raid and "regretted the incident". The prosecutor reportedly also approached Turkish intelligence, seeking a list of Israelis involved in the operation. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4120091,00.html |title=Report: Turkey obtains names of flotilla raid soldiers |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref> . 

On 26 September, the [[National Intelligence Organization (Turkey)|MIT]], Turkey's national intelligence agency, submitted to the state prosecution a list of 174 Israelis it claimed were involved in the raid. Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] topped the list as the "primary responsible party". The list also included all of Israel's cabinet ministers, a variety of high and low-ranking officers, and the photographs of ten soldiers who could not be identified by name. <ref name="ynetnews2">{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4127645,00.html |title=Report: Turkey operated agents in Israel to track soldiers |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref> [[Today's Zaman]] reported that the MIT had operated agents inside Israel to confirm the soldiers' identities, a claim denied by the Turkish government.

The IDF Spokesperson's Office stated that the names were "recycled" from previous lists that were published on anti-Israel websites during the [[Gaza War]].

===Legal assessments===. 
{{Main|Legal assessments of the Gaza flotilla raid}} . 

International law experts differed over the legality of the Israeli action in published assessments following the raid. Legal commentators generally agreed that Israel was required to respond with a proportional use of force in the face of violent resistance, but the degree of proportionality was disputed. <ref name="washingtonpost1" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/afua-hirsch-law-blog/2010/jun/01/gaza-freedom-flotilla-international-law |title=Was the Gaza Flotilla Raid Illegal? |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=Guardian News and Media |accessdate=2 June 2010 | location=London | date=1 June 2010 | first=Afua | last=Hirsch}}</ref> .

Five of those who were later killed by Israeli forces had professed a desire to become shaheeds, or martyrs. One said: 'Two good things will happen: Either we will die as shaheeds or we will reach Gaza.' In a video, another said: 'I pray that Allah grant us the same good end as those shaheeds.'" The article is concluded with "Only through hard fighting&nbsp;– fighting that was necessary, justified and legal&nbsp;– were the prisoners freed. IHH wanted a confrontation and got one." The article's claims were substantiated [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3L7OV414Kk&feature=related by two short video clippings from Al Jazeera interviews and articles] in advance of the raid. The activists are seen chanting a Muslim holy war song, and a woman explained that there are two ways to go: As a martyr or to get through to Gaza. Following the raid, the claims where further substantiated by recorded family members of the killed activists, telling of the martyrdom that the killed activists where wishing on themselves. </ref>
