{{Gaza blockade}}
The '''Turkel Commission''' (officially '''The Public Commission to Examine the Maritime Incident of 31 May 2010''') is an inquiry set up by [[Israel]]i Government to investigate the [[Gaza flotilla raid]], and the [[2007-2010 blockade of the Gaza Strip|Blockade of Gaza]]. It is led by Israeli retired Supreme Court Judge [[Jacob Turkel]]. The other initial members of the commission were former President of the [[Technion]] and military expert, [[Amos Horev]], and professor of international law, [[Shabtai Rosenne]], who died in September 2010. The probe was  overseen by two International observers: [[William David Trimble]], former Leader of the Northern Irish [[Ulster Unionist Party]] and [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] First Minister, a  Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and [[Canada|Canadian]] former military judge [[Ken Watkin]].  . 

In July 2011, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that unnamed Jewish diplomats had seen a draft copy of the UN investigative committee (the Palmer Committee) for the 2010 Flotilla to Gaza and claimed it said that the Turkel Commission inquiry was both "professional and independent". <ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/un-report-gaza-blockade-legal-israel-doesn-t-owe-turkey-apology-for-marmara-1.371841 UN report: Gaza blockade legal, Israel doesn't owe Turkey apology for Marmara]</ref> To date the Palmer Committee report has not been released to the public so the claim cannot be confirmed.  . 

== Background ==. 
In the aftermath of the [[Gaza flotilla raid]], Israel rejected calls from the United Nations and governments all around the world for an independent investigation of the events,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/breaking-news/world/israel-rejects-flotilla-raid-probe-14829850.html |title=Israel rejects flotilla raid probe - World, Breaking News |publisher=Belfasttelegraph.co.uk |date=2010-06-03 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/middle_east/10250354.stm |title=Israel 'to reject international ship raid inquiry' |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-06-06 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6551GO20100606 |title=Israel rejects international panel to study raid: envoy |publisher=Reuters |date= 2010-06-06|accessdate=2010-06-26 | first=Philip | last=Barbara}}</ref><ref name="Spiegel Chip" group="text">{{cite news|last1=Schult|first1=Christoph|last2=Steinvorth|first2=Daniel|journal=Der Spiegel|title=Chip im Slip|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,700808,00.html|date=June 16, 2010|accessdate=June 16, 2010|quote=Regierungen in aller Welt forderten Israel auf, den Vorfall durch internationale Ermittler klären zu lassen, doch Premier Benjamin Netanjahu wollte davon nichts wissen – und hat nun eine interne Kommission eingesetzt.}} (Governments all over the world have urged Israel to have international investigators examine the incident, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not want to hear about this – and has installed an internal commission.)</ref> but has formed a domestic commission of inquiry to investigate the raid, that includes two international observers and is headed by retired [[Supreme Court of Israel]] Justice [[Jacob Turkel]]. <ref>[http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=178328 PM announces raid c'tee framework], Jerusalem Post 14-06-2010</ref><ref name="BBC-inquiry">{{citation | title = Israel sets up inquiry into deadly Gaza flotilla raid | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/middle_east/10305902.stm | publisher = BBC News | date = 14 June 2010}}</ref> . 

== Members ==. 
The Israeli members of the commission were as follows:<ref name=JP230111/> . 

* Chair: Justice (ret.) [[Jacob Turkel]] - former Israeli Supreme Court Justice
* Professor [[Shabtai Rosenne]] - [[Bar Ilan University]] Professor of International Law (Professor Rosenne, 93 years old, died during the work of the commission, on 21 September 2010, and was not replaced.)<ref name=JP230111/><ref>http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/turkel-committee-member-shabtai-rosenne-dies-at-93-1.315062</ref>
* Maj.-Gen (Res.) [[Amos Horev]] - retired Israeli army major-general and [[Technion]] President
* Professor [[Miguel Deutch]] - [[Tel Aviv University]] Professor of Law
* [[Reuven Merhav]] - retired Foreign Ministry director-general . 

The two international observers were: . 

* [[David Trimble]] (UK) - Former Leader of the Northern Irish [[Ulster Unionist Party]] and former [[First Minister and deputy First Minister|First Minister]] of [[Northern Ireland]]
* [[Ken Watkin]] [[Queen's Counsel|Q.C.]](Canadian) - former head of the Canadian military's legal branch, [[Judge Advocate General (Canada)|Judge Advocate General]] . 

The committee was coordinated and managed by [[Hoshea Gottlieb]].  . 

The committee also contracted the services of two foreign international law experts:<ref name=JP230111/>
*Professor Wolf Heintschel von Heinegg
*Professor Michael Schmitt . 

== Authority and operation ==. 
The inquiry was charged with investigating the legality of the Israeli blockade and the legality of the Israeli navy's actions during the raid, and determining whether investigations of claims of war crimes and breaches of international law conform to Western standards. It was also charged with looking into the Turkish position, and the actions taken by the flotilla's organizers, especially the IHH, and examining the identities and intentions of the flotilla's participants.  . 

The commission was approved by the [[Cabinet of Israel]] on 14&nbsp;June. The commission could hold sessions behind closed doors if it so decided. <ref name="guardian.co.uk">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jun/16/israel-gaza-flotilla-inquiry |title=Off the hook: Israel's own Widgery inquiry into Bloody Monday &#124; Chris Doyle &#124; Comment is free &#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=2010-06-16 |accessdate=2010-06-26 | location=London}}</ref> The inquiry was to exclusively examine the legality of Israel's naval blockade of Gaza and the flotilla raid. <ref>{{cite news |title=Ban Ki-Moon demands Israel reconsider rejected probe |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/10269169.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=June 8, 2010}}</ref> . 

Amid widespread media criticism that painted the commission as a tool to justify the blockade of Gaza, the use of force to maintain it and the Gaza flotilla raid, Jacob Turkel told the Israeli government that the commission could not do its job without expanded investigative powers. Other jurists criticized the panel's limited mandate, and the Israeli peace group [[Gush Shalom]] sent a petition to Israel's [[Supreme Court of Israel|High Court of Justice]]. As of June 2010, the committee had no power to subpoena witnesses and cannot draw personal conclusions against those involved in the raid. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Justice Minister Yaakov Neeman, Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Turkel engaged in intense negotiations on the mandate and powers of the commission. Barak refuses to let the panel question any Israel Defense Forces soldiers or officers aside from its Chief of Staff and its Military Advocate General. <ref name="Haaretz Remit">{{cite news|journal=Haaretz|title=Despite wider remit, soldiers won't be questioned in Gaza flotilla probe|date=June 29, 2010|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/despite-wider-remit-soldiers-won-t-be-questioned-in-gaza-flotilla-probe-1.299057|accessdate=June 30, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Ravid|first=Barak|title=Netanyahu likely to widen remit of Gaza flotilla probe after judge threatens to quit|date=June 27, 2010|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/netanyahu-likely-to-widen-remit-of-gaza-flotilla-probe-after-judge-threatens-to-quit-1.299038|accessdate=June 30, 2010}}</ref> . 

== International observers ==. 
The two international observers were [[David Trimble]] of the United Kingdom and Brig.-Gen. (Ret.) [[Ken Watkin]], [[Q.C.]] of Canada. The foreign observers took part in hearings and discussions, but did not vote on the proceedings or the final conclusions. <ref name="BBC-inquiry"/>  Turkel informed the two foreign observers that they would be allowed to question witnesses freely during the hearings and examine any material they wished,<ref name="Haaretz Remit"/> but that they might be denied access to documents or information if it was "almost certain to cause substantial harm to national security or to the state's foreign relations."<ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gzMGxQ1L4PHV74PcqG0GKazb9viA AFP: Israeli panel to probe Gaza flotilla raid]</ref> According to the [[BBC]] and ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', both observers are seen as friends of Israel. <ref>{{cite news|publisher=BBC|last=Wood|first=Paul|title=Israel Gaza probe criticised by Turkey and Palestinians|date=June 14, 2010|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/middle_east/10311653.stm|accessdate=June 14, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|journal=Der Spiegel|last1=Steinvorth|first1=Daniel|last2=Schult|first2=Christoph|title=Gaza Raid Photos Fuel Propaganda War|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,700992,00.html|date=June 16, 2010|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref> . 

In an official letter to the commission after the release of the first part of their findings in January 2011, Trimble and Watkin
stated that they had "no doubt that the Commission is independent.”<ref>{{Citation|last=Trimble|first=David|author-link=David Trimble|last2=Watkin|first2=Kenneth|author2-link=Ken Watkin|title=We have no doubt that the Commission is independent’ |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|pages=|year=2011|date=|url=http://www.jpost.com/home/article.aspx?id=204943|archiveurl=|archivedate=|accessdate=2011–01–25}}</ref> Both expressed their satisfaction with the work of the commission, stating that it had provided them with access to all materials and made sure they were full partners in the process and that "We are glad the commission made ongoing efforts to hear both sides."<ref>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4017686,00.html Foreign observers: Turkel Commission 'made efforts to hear both sides']</ref> . 

==Findings==. 
The first part of the findings were released January 23, 2011. In the 245-page report, the commission "cleared the government and military of wrongdoing" saying that the "passengers were to blame for the violence." It continued and said “by clearly resisting capture, the Mavi Marmara had become a military objective.” "The commission accused the [[IHH]], a Turkish Islamist charity that owned the ''Mavi Marmara'', “of planned and extremely violent” resistance which was “directly connected to the ongoing international armed conflict between Israel and Hamas”."<ref>[http://www.torontosun.com/news/world/2011/01/23/16999971.html#/news/world/2011/01/23/pf-16999966.html Israeli flotilla interception legal: inquiry]</ref> . 

The January 2011 report addressed the following:<ref name=JP230111>{{Citation|last= Izenberg |first= Dan| title= Turkel: Flotilla raid in accordance with int'l law |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|pages=|date=23 January 2011|url= http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=204858|archiveurl=|archivedate=|accessdate=2011-01-25}}</ref>
*The question of whether or not the naval blockade imposed on the Gaza Strip by Israel conformed with the rules of international law. 
*An assessment of the actions taken by the IDF to enforce the naval blockade. 
*An examination of the actions taken by the organizers of the flotilla and its participants and their identity.  . 

The commission members divided the report into two sections, the first dealing with the naval blockade of the Gaza Strip and the second with the operation to capture the Mavi Marmara. <ref name=JP230111/> . 

===Legality of the naval blockade===. 
Regarding whether or not the naval blockade imposed on the Gaza Strip by Israel conformed to the rules of international law, the commission found that the conflict between Israel and the Gaza Strip is an international armed conflict and that Israel’s “effective control” of the Gaza Strip ended when it completed the disengagement from the territory. The purpose of the naval blockade was primarily a military- security one. The naval blockade was imposed on the Gaza Strip lawfully, with Israel complying with the conditions for imposing it. <ref name=JP230111/> . 

The commission also stated that Israel is complying with its humanitarian obligations as the blockading party, including the prohibition against starving the civilian population or preventing the supply of objects essential for the survival of the civilian population and medical supplies, and the requirement that the damage to the civilian population is not excessive in relation to the real and direct military advantage anticipated from the blockade. The imposition and enforcement of the naval blockade on the Gaza Strip was not found to constitute “collective punishment” of the population of the Gaza Strip. <ref name=JP230111/> . 

The commission further found that international law does not give individuals or groups the freedom to ignore the imposition of a naval blockade that satisfies the conditions for imposing it and that is enforced accordingly, especially where a blockade satisfies obligations to neutral parties, merely because in the opinion of those individuals or groups it violates the duties of the party imposing the blockade concerning the entity subject to the blockade. <ref name=JP230111/> . 

===Legality of the raid===. 
Regarding the legality of the raid itself, the commission reached the following conclusion:
A vessel that attempts to breach a blockade is subject to international law governing the conduct of hostilities, and international humanitarian law, including the rules governing the use of force. The Israeli armed forces’ interception and capture of the Gaza flotilla vessels was consistent with established international naval practice. <ref name=JP230111/> . 

===Use of force===. 
Regarding the use of force, the commission concluded the following: . 

*The participants in the flotilla were predominantly an international group of civilians whose main goal was to bring publicity to the humanitarian situation in Gaza by attempting to breach the blockade. <ref name=JP230111/>
*A group of [[IHH (Turkish NGO)|IHH]] and affiliated activists on board the Mavi Marmara and the other flotilla vessels violently opposed the Israeli boarding. The IHH activists who participated in that violence were civilians taking a direct part in hostilities. <ref name=JP230111/>
* The force used against civilians on board the flotilla was governed by the principles of "necessity" and use of "proportionate force" associated with human rights-based law enforcement norms. The IHH activists lost the protection of their civilian status when they directly participated in the hostilities. <ref name=JP230111/>
*The Rules of Engagement for the operation provided an authority to use force that reflected the nature of a law-enforcement operation. <ref name=JP230111/>
*The IHH activists carried out the violence on board the Mavi Marmara by arming themselves with a wide array of weapons, including iron bars, axes, clubs, slingshots, knives, and metal objects. These were weapons capable of causing death or serious injury. Further, the hostilities were conducted in an organized manner with IHH activists, among others, operating in groups when violently assaulting the IDF soldiers. <ref name=JP230111/>
*The IHH activists used firearms against the IDF soldiers during the hostilities. <ref name=JP230111/> . 

The Commission examined 133 incidents in which force was used. The majority of the uses of force involved warning or deterring fire and less lethal weapons. The commission found that overall, the IDF personnel acted professionally in the faces of extensive and unanticipated violence. This included continuing to switch back and forth between less-lethal and lethal weapons in order to address the nature of the violence directed at them. The commission concluded that in 127 cases, the use of force appeared to be in conformity with international law.  In six cases, the commission concluded that it had insufficient information to be able to make a determination. Three out of those six cases involved the use of live fire and three cases involved physical force; two incidents of kicking and one strike with the butt of a gun. In five out of the 127 incidents that appeared to be in conformity with international law, there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the use of force was also in accordance with law enforcement norms. However, in these cases, force appeared to be used against persons taking a direct part in hostilities and, as a consequence, was in conformity with international law. <ref name=JP230111/> . 

===Planning and organization ===. 
Regarding the planning and organization of the IDF mission to enforce the blockade, the commission stated that violent opposition to the boarding was not anticipated, and this had a direct impact on the operational tactics, rules of engagement, and training before the operation. However, the focus of the planning and organization of the operation on a lower level of resistance did not lead to a breach of international law, the commission said. <ref name=JP230111/> . 

===Conclusions===. 
In its final remarks, the committee concluded that:
*“The naval blockade imposed on the Gaza Strip – in view of the security circumstances and Israel’s efforts to comply with its humanitarian obligations – was legal pursuant to the rules of international law.” <ref name=JP230111/>
*“The actions carried out by Israel on May 31, 2010, to enforce the naval blockade had the regrettable consequences of the loss of human life and physical injuries. Nonetheless, and despite the limited number of uses of force for which we could not reach a conclusion, the actions taken were found to be legal pursuant to the rules of international law.” <ref name=JP230111/> . 

== Criticism ==. 
The major{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} criticisms to date have been:
# Why have a commission at all?
# Why have a commission with limited investigative and subpoena powers?
# The advanced age of the three initial Israeli members (average age, 85)<ref>http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=178681</ref>
# Why are there no women members in the commission?<ref>http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=184518</ref> . 

[[Turkey]] and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas dismissed the Israeli investigation and said it would not meet demands set by the UN Security Council. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/10311653.stm | work=BBC News | title=Israel raid probe 'not impartial' | date=2010-06-14}}</ref> The Israeli newspaper Haaretz described the investigation as more and more like a "farce" and criticized its credibility and fairness. <ref>http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/the-public-has-a-right-to-know-1.295797</ref> UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon repeated the demand for an independent investigation, stating that the Israeli investigation will not have international credibility. <ref>"U.N. Leader Criticizes Israeli Plan for Inquiry". The New York Times. http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/19/world/middleeast/19nations.html. </ref> . 

Amnesty International called the commission a "whitewash," saying it "reinforces the view that the Israeli authorities are unwilling or incapable of delivering accountability for abuses of international law committed by Israeli forces."<ref>http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=19213</ref> The Israeli human rights group Gisha said that "No commission of inquiry can authorize the collective punishment of a civilian population by restricting its movement and access, as Israel did in its closure of Gaza, of which the maritime closure was an integral part." <ref>http://www.gisha.org/index.php?intLanguage=2&intItemId=1960&intSiteSN=113&OldMenu=113</ref>  . 

The commission's chairman Jacob Turkel also criticized the structure of the commission and threatened to resign if its powers were not expanded. He has requested that the commission be recognized as an official state commission of inquiry with full powers under the Commissions of Inquiry law, have two more members, be allowed to subpoena witnesses and documents, warn those who testify before it that the panel's findings could harm them, and hire outside experts in relevant fields. <ref>http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/despite-wider-remit-soldiers-won-t-be-questioned-in-gaza-flotilla-probe-1.299057</ref><ref>http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3912708,00.html</ref><ref>http://www.knesset.gov.il/review/data/eng/law/kns6_inquiry_eng.pdf</ref> In July 2010, the Israeli cabinet voted to expand the committee's powers to include subpoenas and receiving sworn testimony but with the proviso that they cannot speak with any IDF soldiers. <ref>http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/government-expands-authority-of-gaza-flotilla-probe-commission-1.299955</ref> . 

Israel's High Court of Justice provided strong support for the criticism against the absence of women on the commission, when it found for the petitioners, Israeli feminist NGOs led by Itach-Maaki: Women Lawyers for Social Justice. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=184483 |title=Court asks why no women on Turkel panel |work=Jerusalem Post |first=Ben |last=Hartman |date=12 August 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-17}}</ref> The petitioners challenged the absence of women on the commission, particularly after its expansion from three to five members, when it was no longer composed only of international law experts, but included a diplomat and a civil law expert. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3923968,00.html |title=Minister Livnat: Turkel's request chauvinistic |work=Ynetnews |first=Roni |last=Sofer |date=22 July 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-17}}</ref> The Court ruled that by failing to nominate women, Israel's Government violated its duty under the Equal Rights for Women's Law. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/should-israel-s-gaza-flotilla-probe-be-suspended-1.307259 |title=Should Israel's Gaza flotilla probe be suspended? |work=Haaretz |first=Merav |last=Michaeli |date=11 August 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-17}}</ref> The Law was amended in 2005, following [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325]].

Dismissing the Government's claims that it was too late to add new members to the commission because its work is too far advanced,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/turkel-refused-to-add-woman-to-gaza-flotilla-probe-state-claims-1.307553?localLinksEnabled=false |title=Turkel refused to add woman to Gaza flotilla probe, state claims |work=Haaretz |first=Tomer |last=Zarchin |date=12 August 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-17}}</ref> and that there were no qualified women to be found, the High Court issued a decree ordering the Government to add at least one woman to the commission's panel. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=184518 |title=High Court: Turkel must appoint woman |work=Jerusalem Post |first=Ben |last=Hartman |date=12 August 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-17}}</ref> The Court added that if the Government approaches five qualified women and all of them refuse the invitation to serve on the commission, then this time around the Government would be considered as having fulfilled its legal obligation to consider women's representation. Two weeks after the Court's ruling, the Government announced that five women refused to serve on the commission, and that it therefore considered itself in compliance with the law. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=185652 |title=Neeman: Five women refused to serve on the Turkel panel |work=Jerusalem Post |first=Dan |last=Izenberg |date=23 August 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-17}}</ref> Justice Minister Yaakov Ne'eman, after reportedly lying to Government Cabinet on his actions toward nominating women,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/avoiding-the-land-mines-1.304978 |title=Avoiding the 'land mines' |work=Haaretz |first=Yossi |last=Verter |date=30 July 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-17}}</ref> publicly expressed his view that the Court's ruling was a severe mistake. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/loyal-to-whom-1.312425 |title=Loyal to whom? |work=Haaretz |date=6 September 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-17}}</ref> . 

The ruling, however, have made an ongoing impact on the governmental culture with regards to women. When, in August 2010, Prime Minister Netanyahu announced the launch of direct peace negotiations, he announced that he would abide by his legal duty and nominate women to the negotiation team. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=186471 |work=Jerusalem Post |title=Netanyahu to appoint female negotiator to peace talks team |date=30 August 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-17}}</ref> Shortly afterword, when Defense Minister Ehud Barak established an investigative committee to inquire about the "[[Yoav Galant]] Document" affair, he too nominated a woman to that committee.  .
