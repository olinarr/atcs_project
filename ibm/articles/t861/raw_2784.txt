Ultimately, the sailing did not take place. <ref>{{cite news |author=JTA |date=1 July 2011 |title=Flotilla delayed until next week |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/israel/article/flotilla_delayed_until_next_week_20110701/ |work=Jewish Journal |accessdate=2 July 2011}}</ref> . 

The flotilla was organized by a coalition of 22 [[NGO]]s.  Its name refers to the May 2010 [[Gaza Flotilla Raid|Gaza Freedom Flotilla]]. Their stated goal was to end the blockade of Gaza "completely and permanently". <ref>{{cite press release |date=18 June 2011 |url=http://www.freedomflotilla.eu/en/information/3-freedomflotilla-announcements/129-press-release-from-istanbul |title=Press Release from Istanbul |publisher=Freedomflotilla.eu |accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref> Initially, 10 ships, with 1,000 activists<ref name="AJN_24Jun2011a"/> were set to sail for Gaza, but by 28 June 2011, the [[List of participants of Freedom Flotilla II|number of expected participants]] had decreased to fewer than 300, plus a few dozen journalists, and by 7 July all but a few dozen activists had returned home. <ref name="Katz-2010"/><ref name="Magnezi-28-June-2011">{{cite news |last=Magnezi |first=Aviel |date=28 June 2011 |title=Fewer than 300 join flotilla |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4088464,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref> . 

The flotilla was publicly opposed by the [[United States]], [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Turkey]], [[Canada]], the [[Middle East Quartet]] (consisting of the [[European Union]], [[Russia]], the [[United Nations]], and the United States), and [[United Nations Secretary General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]]. It was publicly supported by the Hamas administration of the Gaza Strip whose leaders asked countries to support the flotilla, saying that the blockade was a crime,<ref name="cbc.ca">{{cite news |date=2 July 2011 |title=Gaza-bound activists vow to complete trek |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/07/03/gaza-flotilla.html |work=CBC World News |accessdate=2 July 2011}}</ref> and that claims that the blockade had ended were wrong.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} . 

Activists on two ships, one in Greece and one in Turkey, found similar damage to their propeller shafts, and claimed that the ships had been sabotaged by Israel. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-also-sabotaged-irish-ship-say-gaza-flotilla-organizers-1.370434

They were intercepted by the Greek coast guard, brought back to shore, and a few activists were arrested. Activists responded by occupying the Spanish embassy in Athens. <ref name="sunk"/> . 

Only the French ship ''Dignité Al Karama'' managed to approach Gaza. They advised the Greek authorities that their destination was the Egyptian port of [[Alexandria]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://alethonews.wordpress.com/2011/07/18/dignite-al-karama-sailing-to-gaza/ |title=Dignité-Al Karama sailing to Gaza |work=Aletho News |date=18 July 2011 |accessdate=August 22, 2011}}</ref> and then turned toward Gaza. <ref name="AlJazeera-2011-07-18"/> On July 19, the ship was intercepted and boarded without incident by Israeli commandos and escorted to the Israeli port of [[Ashdod]]. <ref name="BBC-2011-07-19"/> . 

==Background==. 
[[Image:Gazaseablocade.png|thumb|250px|Gaza Strip naval blockade area, as published by Israel's Ministry of Transport]]
After the 2007, [[Fatah-Hamas conflict]], Israel and Egypt closed off their respective borders with Gaza, preventing most goods and nearly all people from going in and out. <ref name="NYT_16June2011a"/> . 

At the end of May 2010 a flotilla of six ships left from Turkey towards the Gaza Strip. The main purpose of the flotilla, according to its organizers, was to bring humanitarian supplies to the Gaza Strip. On 31 May 2010 the [[Gaza flotilla raid|Israeli navy raided the ships]] some 40 kilometres away from Gaza shores. During the takeover, a violent confrontation occurred in which nine activists were killed on one of the ships and several Israeli soldiers were injured as well as dozens of passengers from several ships. At the end of the operation the ships were seized by the Israeli navy and taken to the port of Ashdod.  . 

Following the 2010 Gaza flotilla raid, international outrage contributed to a shift in Israeli policy. Both Israel and Egypt eased their blockade, letting in more goods over land. <ref name="NYT_16June2011a"/> In June 2010 Egypt decided to open the land crossings between Egypt and the Gaza Strip in order to transfer a minimal amount of supplies.  . 

After the events of the 2011 flotilla raid, organizations from several countries declared their intention to send more ships to break the blockade on Gaza. As a result, the Israeli government announced that the any ships attempting to break the blockade of the Gaza Strip would be arrested.  . 

Opinions on the [[Legal assessments of the Gaza flotilla raid#Legality of blockade|legality]] of Israel's blockade of the Gaza strip, as well as on the use of force in international waters to maintain the blockade, are divided. <ref name="washingtonpost1">{{cite news |last=Lynch |first=Colum |date=1 June 2010 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/01/AR2010060102934.html?hpid=topnews |title=Israel's flotilla raid revives questions of international law |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Hirsch |first=Afua |date=1 June 2010 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/afua-hirsch-law-blog/2010/jun/01/gaza-freedom-flotilla-international-law |title=Was the Gaza Flotilla Raid Illegal? |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref> . 

On 3 July 2011, the Greek government offered to bring humanitarian aid to Gaza themselves, but Greece's offer was turned down by the activists. <ref>{{cite news |last=Katz |first=Yaakov |date=4 July 2011 |title=Activists reject Greek offer to send flotilla aid |url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=227783 |work=Jerusalem Post |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref> . 

==Structure==. 
===Name===. 
The flotilla was named in memory of [[Vittorio Arrigoni]], an Italian reporter and activist whose killing by suspected members of a Palestinian [[Salafist jihadism|Salafist]] group in Gaza in April 2011 "left the Palestinian activist community stunned." His favourite expression was "Stay Human". <ref>{{Cite news |last=Schwartz |first=Susan |date=2 June 2011 |title=The Stay Human Flotilla to Gaza |url=http://muslimmedianetwork.com/mmn/?p=8577 |location=Farmington, MI |work=Muslim Observer |accessdate=26 June 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zjldAJ01 |deadurl=no |archivedate=26 June 2011}}</ref> . 

===Ships===. 
Originally it was thought that the ''[[MV Mavi Marmara|Mavi Marmara]]'' would lead the flotilla, but in mid-June, IHH announced that the ship would be unable to sail due to technical issues. <ref name="NYT_17June2011a">{{cite news |last=Arsu |first=Sebnem |date=17 June 2011 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/18/world/europe/18briefs-Turkey.html |title=Turkey: Aid Ship Won't Join Flotilla |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref>  As of 10 July 2011, the following ships had planned on sailing to reach Gaza:<ref name="Hass-2011"/> .

==Events==. 
===Preparations===. 
The IHH announced plans for the new flotilla, again led by the ''Mavi Marmara'' to depart for Gaza in June 2011. IHH President Fehmi Bulent Yıldırım said "Even if we sacrifice shahids (martyrs) for this cause, we will be on the side of justice."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Magnezi |first=Aviel |date=18 May 2011 |title=IHH: Mavi Marmara ready for next flotilla |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4070717,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref> In June 2011, the IHH conveyed a message to the Israeli government through Turkish Jews that the organization was not interested in another clash with Israel, and a proposal that the ships be inspected in a third-party country, such as [[Cyprus]], before being allowed into Gaza. <ref>{{Cite news |last=Eichner |first=Itamar |date=14 June 2011 |title=IHH sends 'no violence' message to Israel |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4081829,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref> . 

Plans for the new flotilla were met with international opposition. [[United Nations]] Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] urged Mediterranean governments to discourage the new flotilla and send aid through "legitimate crossings and established channels",<ref>{{Cite news |author=Reuters |date=27 May 2010 |title=UN chief: Discourage new Gaza flotilla |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4074876,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref> the United States warned against the flotilla reportedly considered asking Turkey to host a peace summit between Israel and the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] provided that it stop it,<ref>{{Cite news |author=Ynet |title=US: Peace summit instead of flotilla |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4077939,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |date=3 June 2011 |accessdate=24 June 2011}}</ref> and Canada warned its nationals not to participate in the flotilla and called it "provocative". <ref>{{Cite news |author=AFP |date=30 May 2011 |title=Canada warns citizens: Avoid Gaza flotilla |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4076037,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref> [[Turkey]] urged activists to reconsider the need for a flotilla in light of the newly opened [[Rafah crossing]], but also urged Israel to act wisely and avoid past mistakes. <ref>{{cite news |last=Greenberg |first=Hanan |date=15 June 2011 |title=Navy gears for Turkish flotilla  |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4082355,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref> . 

Several Dutch journalists who were due to travel in the flotilla backed out in late June, accusing the organizers of non-transparency, particularly with regard to their relations with [[Hamas]], restrictiveness, dishonesty and "shocking" gullibility. Journalist Eric Beauchemin said, "never have I seen a more closed organization. When we would ask critical questions they would accuse us of being unprofessional. Restrictions were imposed on us that hadn't been agreed upon beforehand."<ref>{{cite news |last=van de Poll  |first=Wilfred |date=29 June 2011 |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4492/Nederland/article/detail/2459749/2011/06/29/Pers-vertrouwt-Gazaboot-niet.dhtml |title=Pers vertrouwt Gazaboot niet |language=Dutch |work=Trouw.nl |accessdate=10 July 2011 |postscript=;}} translated in {{cite web |url=http://www.ngo-monitor.org/article.php?viewall=yes&id=3433 |title=Press doesn't trust Gaza-boat |work=[[NGO Monitor]] |date=30 June 2011 |accessdate=10 July 2011}}</ref> . 

In France, a ship purchased for the flotilla was prevented from sailing after being denied permission to dock in [[Marseille]]. The move followed intense political pressure by the Jewish community on members of [[Parliament of France|Parliament]], political parties, and organizations, which in turn pressured insurance companies and authorities. <ref>{{Cite news |last=Medzini |first=Ronen |date=15 June 2011 |title=French flotilla ship won't sail |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4082772,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref> A day before, the IHH had announced that was rethinking its participation in the flotilla and might withdraw from the initiative. <ref>{{Cite news |last=Magnezi |first=Aviel |date=15 June 2011 |title=IHH may not take part in flotilla |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4082482,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref> On 17 June, İHH announced that they are still part of the flotilla movement, though the ''Mavi Marmara'' pulled out from the flotilla because, according to Yildirim, president of IHH, "after the damage caused to the Mavi Marmara [last year], we are not in a position to go to sea". <ref name="ihhff2">{{cite web |title=Freedom Flotilla II to go ahead as planned |url=http://www.ihh.org.tr/ii-ozgurluk-filosu-yoluna-devam-ediyor/en/ |location=Istanbul |publisher=IHH |accessdate=26 June 2011}}<br />• {{cite news|last=Buck|first=Tobias|title=Turkish flagship pulls out of Gaza flotilla|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ec4ab2dc-98eb-11e0-bd66-00144feab49a.html#axzz1RE42WnpH|accessdate=5 July 2011|newspaper=The Financial Times|date=17 June 2011}}</ref> . 

===Initial leg===. 
Two of the vessels taking part in the flotilla set sail from the French island of [[Corsica]] to Greece, to meet up with the other vessels. The vessels docked in [[Piraeus]]. <ref>{{cite news |last=Ya'ar |first=Chana |date=26 June 2011 |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/145187 |title=Flotilla Vessels Sail from France |work=Arutz Sheva |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref> However, the French vessel ''Dignité&nbsp;– Al Karama'' did not dock, and proceeded directly towards the Gaza Strip. <ref>{{cite news |last=Magnezi |first=Aviel |date=29 June 2011 |title=Gaza-bound flotilla underway |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4088843,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref> . 

===Vessels damaged===. 
On 27 June 2011, activists announced that they had discovered damage to two of the vessels, the ''Juliano'' and ''MV Saoirse''. Both the vessels had their propellers and pipes leading to their engines damaged. According to Flotilla spokesman [[Dror Feiler]], there was no direct evidence Israel was involved,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Keinon |first1=Kerb |last2=Katz |first2=Yaakov |date=30 June 2011 |title='Damaged Irish ship won't join flotilla after sabotage' |url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=227274 |work=Jerusalem Post |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref> and he estimated the damage would take several days to repair. Other flotilla organizers suspected that the damage was the result of a sabotage operation by Israeli naval divers, and demanded that the Greek police and port authorities provide security for the vessels. Some activists announced that they themselves planned to guard the vessels. <ref>{{cite news |last=Pfeffer |first=Anshel |date=29 June 2011 |title=Gaza flotilla organizers demand Greek police provide security for ships |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/gaza-flotilla-organizers-demand-greek-police-provide-security-for-ships-1.370132 |work=Haaretz |accessdate=30 June 2011}}<br />• {{cite news |last=Magnezi |first=Aviel |date=28 June 2011 |title=Organizers: Israeli divers harmed flotilla ship |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4088583,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref> On 29 June, the ''MV Saoirse'' sustained damage while docked in [[Turkey]]. Activists claimed that the damage was caused by Israeli divers, who were able to avoid detection by guards stationed on the vessel. <ref>{{cite news |last=Magnezi |first=Aviel |date=30 June 2011 |title=Activists: Israel sabotaged Irish vessel too |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4089151,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref> . 

A number of passengers on the flotilla said they had been mugged on the streets near the port and had mobile phones stolen, and that suspicious "fishermen" had been sighted near the ships, loitering without bait or buckets, by waters that are known to be contaminated. <ref>{{cite news |author1=Haaretz |last2=Hass |first2=Amira |date=30 June 2011 |title=Israel also sabotaged Irish ship, say Gaza flotilla organizers |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-also-sabotaged-irish-ship-say-gaza-flotilla-organizers-1.370434 |work=Haaretz |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref> . 

Israel flatly rejected the accusations as "paranoid" and accused the activists of "living in a [[James Bond]] film."<ref name="greek"/> . 

Selcuk Unal, a spokesman for the Turkish Foreign Ministry, said that an investigation by [[Turkey|Turkish]] authorities determined that there was no act of sabotage on the Irish ship, which had been docked in the Turkish port of Gocek. <ref name="apgreece"/> These claims have been disputed by Activists who called for an independent investigation into how the ''MV Saoirse'' was damaged. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/irish-group-doubts-independence-of-aid-ship-sabotage-probe-511344.html

Due to the damage, the ''MV Saoirse's'' plans to join the flotilla were cancelled but several Irish activists went to Corfu to join the Italian/Dutch ship, the MV Stefano Chiarini.  . 

===Greek travel ban===. 
Greece announced that any vessels bound for Gaza are forbidden from leaving their ports. <ref name="csm-greece"/> Greece emphasized safety concerns and noted that the Secretary General of the United Nations, the European Council, the Middle East Quartet and Greece itself had already urged against participation in the flotilla. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/AuthoritiesAbroad/North+America/USA/EmbassyWashington/Articles/en-US/Foreign+Ministry+Announcement+regarding+Greece%E2%80%99s+intention+to+undertake+the+task+of+transporting+hum.htm |title=Foreign Ministry Announcement regarding Greece's intention to undertake the task of transporting humanitarian aid |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Embassy Of Greece |date=3 July 2011 |accessdate=10 July 2011}}</ref> .

On 1 July, the American-manned flotilla boat ''Audacity of Hope'', which was not carrying any aid, sailed from [[Perama]] in violation of this Greek ban. It was intercepted after about ten minutes by an armed [[Hellenic Coast Guard]] boat and two Zodiac speedboats. An hours-long standoff ensued, with the coast guard initially trying to persuade the boat to turn back. Eventually, the boat was boarded by armed coast guard personnel and escorted to a Greek naval facility. <ref name="greek"/><ref name="bill"/><ref>{{cite news |last=Torchia |first=Christopher |date=2 July 2011 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2011/07/02/greeks_turn_back_us_protesters_bound_for_blockaded_gaza/ |title=Greeks turn back US protesters bound for blockaded Gaza |work=The Boston Globe |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=2 July 2011}}</ref> Greek authorities arrested the American captain of the boat, John Klusmire, and held him on charges of endangering the lives of the boat's passengers, which is a felony, and of trying to leave port without permission. Activists responded by launching a [[hunger strike]]. Klusmire was released from custody on 5 July, but the charges against him were not dropped. <ref name="apgreece"/><ref name="sunk"/><ref name="haspanish"/><ref name="apreleases"/> "Only a fool thought we'd get to Gaza given what happened last year.

On 4 July, the mainly Canadian-manned ''Tahrir'' sailed from [[Crete]] in violation of the ban. It did so without its original Greek crew on board, and instead with "international volunteers" piloting the boat. Canadian Soha Kneen and Australian Michael Coleman were arrested after they used [[kayak]]s to surround a Greek coast guard vessel pursuing the boat. The coast guard vessel caught up to the ''Tahrir'' after about 15 minutes. Passengers attempted to protect the wheelhouse by draping it with netting and blocking doorways by sitting in front of them and linking arms. The ''Tahrir'' was sprayed with water cannons, boarded by armed officers, and towed back to port. One activist claimed that two officers boarded the boat, and one had a pistol drawn as he approached the boat's wheelhouse to take control. Canadian citizen Sandra Ruch, who was responsible for the boat, was arrested on charges of illegally sailing without permission. Fifty other passengers were detained by the Greek coastal authority. <ref name="greece_blocks_boat"/><ref name="braced"/> Activists claimed that the coast guard vessel rammed the boat against a cement pier and demanded that it be fixed immediately at Greece's expense. <ref name="bill"/><ref name="apreleases"/><ref>{{cite news |last=Chai |first=Carmen |date=5 July 2011 |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Canadians+freed+after+flotilla+attempts+leave+Greece+Gaza/5052446/story.html |title=Canadians freed after flotilla attempts to leave Greece for Gaza |work=The Vancouver Sun |accessdate=10 July 2011}}</ref> Activists Soha Kneen and Michael Coleman were tried and found guilty of obstructing the interception of the ''Tahrir'', and were sentenced to 30 days in prison.

In the early morning of 5 July, the French yacht ''Dignité&nbsp;– Al Karama'', carrying eight passengers, evaded the Greek coast guard and left a port near Athens, but turned back on its own after several hours. Reportedly, the activists aboard aboard the vessel did not want to be the only ones sailing to the Gaza Strip. <ref name="sunk"/><ref name="haspanish"/><ref name="braced"/> Later, the vessel attempted to depart again in defiance of the Greek ban, but was stopped and taken to the port of [[Sitia]] on the island of [[Crete]]. Greek authorities said that during these events the yacht collided with a Greek coast guard vessel and damaged it. <ref>{{cite news |last=jpost.com staff |date=17 July 2011 |title='Gaza-bound flotilla yacht leaves Greece, sails to Egypt' |url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=229670 |work=Jerusalem Post |accessdate=21 August 2011}}</ref> . 

On 5 July, about 20 Spanish activists from the ship ''Guernica'' occupied the Spanish embassy in Athens to protest the Greek travel ban. <ref name="sunk"/><ref name="braced"/> . 

===Activist withdrawal===. 
On 7 July 2011 most of the activists withdrew from the initiative and left Greece for home. Only a few dozen remained to try to convince the Greek government to end its travel ban. <ref name="Katz-2010"/> .

On 16 July, the French yacht ''Dignité Al Karama'' left the Greek island of [[Kastellorizo]] after informing Greek authorities that its destination was the [[Egypt]]ian port of [[Alexandria]]. <ref name="egypt"/> Instead, the vessel headed for Gaza.

''Dignité Al Karama'' was stopped by the [[Israeli Navy]] about 65 kilometers off the coast of Gaza, in international waters, after ignoring warnings that it was approaching the Gaza blockade line and must change course for either [[Ashdod]] or [[Egypt]]. The yacht was surrounded by at least three Israeli warships and boarded by [[Shayetet 13]] naval commandos, who took over the vessel, arrested the passengers, and transferred them to a warship.

A top Israeli naval officer{{Who|date=July 2011}} warned that Israel would prevent the ships from breaking its [[2007–present blockade of the Gaza Strip|blockade on Gaza]] at all costs, and that Israel would again use force if required, including boarding the ships and confronting the activists.

===Journalists=== . 

{{Undue|section|date=July 2011}} . 

Award-winning [[Israeli-Arab]] journalist [[Khaled Abu Toameh]] noted that "according to Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip, there is no shortage of basic foods", and that "periodic shortage of medical supplies is often attributed to the ongoing power struggle between Hamas and Fatah, whose representatives in the West Bank are sometimes accused of withholding medicine as a way of punishing the Hamas government." Abu Toameh questioned why, given this situation, the flotilla organizers did not plan to help [[Syria]]n and [[Libya]]n refugees, whose situation was worse, or to express solidarity with [[Saudi Arabia]]n women who are being [[gender apartheid in Saudi Arabia|arrested for driving]] cars. <ref>{{cite web |last=Abu Toameh |first=Khaled |date=1 July 2011 |url=http://www.hudson-ny.org/2236/palestinians-gaza-strip-flotilla |title=Life for Palestinians in Gaza Strip Improved, So Why Send Flotilla There? |work=Hudson New York |accessdate=11 July 2011}}</ref> . 

Canada's ''[[National Post]]'' editorialized against the flotilla, calling it a "charade". It concluded that <blockquote>the real intention of the flotilla is to break the blockade and end Hamas' political isolation. There can be only one reason why anyone would consider such an outcome desirable: The absence of a blockade would allow the free passage of arms to the terror-embracing Hamas government, which has frequently demonstrated its goal of ending Israel's existence as a nation. Israel's blockade of Gaza is a direct consequence of attacks launched from within the territory. If flotilla participants really want to ease Gazans' isolation, they should encourage Hamas to acknowledge Israel's right to exist and to forswear terrorism. <ref>{{cite web |author=National Post editorial board |date=4 July 2011 |title=National Post editorial board: On Israel, Greece gets it right |url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2011/07/04/national-post-editorial-board-on-israel-greece-gets-it-right/ |work=National Post Full Comment |location=Toronto |accessdate=10 July 2011}}</ref>
</blockquote> . 

''[[Pravda]]'' argued in favour of the flotilla, stating <blockquote>And so the world was forgetting Gaza. It forgot that the blockade was deemed illegal by the UN. They paid little attention to the complaints of people like Ilan Pappé, former professor of history at the [[University of Haifa]], "Israel uses genocidal policies in Gaza." The lack of UN action was left to pass blankly, whose commission investigating the massacre of Freedom Flotilla I was paralyzed (as though we do not know why).  It is because of this forgetfulness that Freedom Flotilla 2 was ready to sail. Remember the tragedy in Gaza is far from over. The people there are still suffering a totally illegal and unjust blockade that has lasted five years. Humanity cannot continue allowing a city to be slowly strangled. <ref>{{cite web |last=Eça |first=Luiz |date=9 July 2011 |url=http://english.pravda.ru/history/09-07-2011/118438-Gaza_what_the_world_forgot-0/ |title=Gaza: what the world forgot |work=Pravda |accessdate=21 July 2011}}</ref>

===Other===. 
Businessmen from the Gaza Strip interviewed by ''[[Ynet]]'' said regarding the flotilla that the main problem was not importing goods into Gaza, as there was "no shortage of stock" in the territory, but the difficulty of exporting goods. However, they stressed that they were not opposed to the flotilla. <ref>{{cite news |last=Levy |first=Elior |date=1 July 2011 |title=Gazans unimpressed by flotilla |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4089709,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref> . 

Author [[Alice Walker]] announced that she will join the flotilla and published a letter in support of the Flotilla.  The letter puts the flotilla in the context of the "followers of Gandhi," and the "Jewish civil rights activists" who stood side by side with blacks in America's South.  In the letter, she also rebukes Benjamin Netanyahu policies, and those in the US who back them. <ref>{{cite news |last=Harman |first=Danna |date=23 June 2011 |title=Author Alice Walker to take part in Gaza flotilla, despite U.S. warning |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/author-alice-walker-to-take-part-in-gaza-flotilla-despite-u-s-warning-1.369262 |work=Haaretz |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref> Fellow author [[Howard Jacobson]] criticized Walker saying that her concern for setting the children of Gaza over the children of Israel does not justify the flotilla, and that she gives no convincing reason for partaking. <ref>{{cite news |author=JTA |date=24 June 2011 |title=UK writer slams Alice Walker for Gaza flotilla ride |url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2011/06/24/3088287/acclaimed-novelist-criticizes-alice-walker-for-gaza-flotilla-participation |publisher=JTA |accessdate=10 July 2011}}</ref> . 

Philip Missfelder, foreign policy spokesman of the [[Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) and [[Christian Social Union]] (CSU) parties, the largest combined group of MPs in the [[German parliament]], said on 5 July that the so-called Gaza flotilla activists "endanger peace efforts" and their action is "part of the asymmetrical warfare against Israel." He added that their actions were "not about humanitarian help, rather a confrontation with Israel". He further stated that the activists were working against the goals of Germany and the Middle East Quartet. "I welcome that the Greek authorities have decisively intervened as some activists set sail without permission," he said. <ref name="braced"/> . 

[[Harvard University]] literature professor [[Ruth Wisse]] condemned the flotilla as a "kill-the-Jews flotilla", stating that its purpose was "to discredit the Israeli attempt to protect itself and to give Hamas a free hand amassing weapons to use against Israeli civilians". <ref>{{cite news |last=Twersky |first=Mordechai I. |date=4 July 2011 |title=Harvard professor assails 'kill-the-Jews flotilla' |url=http://www.jpost.com/VideoArticles/Video/Article.aspx?id=227881 |work=Jerusalem Post |accessdate=10 July 2011}}</ref> . 

[[Christopher Hitchens]] condemned the flotilla for its cooperation with Hamas, noting Hamas' official and programmatic adoption of the [[antisemitic]] forgery ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', its expression of outrage at the [[death of Osama bin Laden]], and its ties with [[Hezbollah]], [[al-Qaeda]] and the regimes of [[Syria]] and [[Iran]]. He also criticized the media for "soft-centred coverage" of the affair, suggesting that pointed questions should have been asked of the flotilla participants and that the title "activists" was an inaccurate and gratuitously positive label for the participants. <ref>{{cite web |last=Hitchins |first=Christopher |date=5 July 2011 |title=Christopher Hitchens: Some questions for the 'activists' aboard the Gaza flotilla |url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2011/07/05/christopher-hitchens-some-questions-for-the-%E2%80%9Cactivists%E2%80%9D-aboard-the-gaza-flotilla/ |work=National Post Full Comment |location=Toronto |accessdate=10 July 2011}}</ref> .

Four [[Nobel Peace]] Laureates, [[Mairead Maguire]], [[Jody Williams]], [[Shirin Ebadi]], and [[Rigoberta Menchú Tum]], wrote a letter to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon "to urge you to use your good offices in support of the humanitarian needs of the people of Gaza....by appointing a representative to inspect and seal the cargo of the boats of the Freedom Flotilla II—thus assuring the Israeli government that the boats are carrying humanitarian supplies such as toys, medical supplies, cement and educational materials."<ref>{{cite web|title=Laureates to Ban Ki-moon: Safe passage for Gaza Flotilla |url=http://www.nobelwomensinitiative.org/home/article/laureates-support-freedom-flotilla |date=10 June 2011 <!--date of the open letter--> |location=Ottawa |publisher=Nobel Women's Initiative |accessdate=10 July 2011}}</ref> . 

On 7 July 2011, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] linguistics professor [[Noam Chomsky]], wrote "Today the U.S. and Israel are vigorously seeking to block the flotilla. U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] virtually authorized violence, stating that 'Israelis have the right to defend themselves' if flotillas 'try to provoke action by entering into Israeli waters'&nbsp;– that is, the territorial waters of Gaza, as if Gaza belonged to Israel. Greece agreed to prevent the boats from leaving (that is, those boats not already sabotaged)&nbsp;– though, unlike Clinton, Greece referred rightly to 'the maritime area of Gaza.' In January 2009, Greece had distinguished itself by refusing to permit U.S. arms to be shipped to Israel from Greek ports during the vicious U.S.-Israeli assault in Gaza. No longer an independent country in its current financial duress, Greece evidently cannot risk such unusual integrity."<ref>{{cite web |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |date=7 July 2011 |title=In Israel, a Tsunami Warning |url=http://www.truth-out.org/israel-tsunami-warning/1310042953 |work=Truthout |accessdate=10 July 2011}}</ref> . 

===Reactions to Greek ban===. 
Greek President [[Karolos Papoulias]] later visited Israel, where Israeli President [[Shimon Peres]] told him: "I thank you very much for fulfilling the UN secretary general's guidelines and stopping the flotilla. Thank you for not allowing people interested in disturbing good order and international law from coming without supervision to Gaza, which is led by a terrorist group."<ref name="egypt"/> . 

Joshua Mitnick of the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' reported that Greece's actions were the result of a growing relationship between Israel and Greece, including an offer of "generous military assistance", that started after Israeli–Turkish ties were damaged by the Gaza flotilla raid. <ref name="csm-greece"/> .
