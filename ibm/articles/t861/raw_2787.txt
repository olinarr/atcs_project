Many '''legal assessments of the [[Gaza flotilla raid]]''' were published subsequent to the event. International law experts (and non-lawyers) differed over the legality of the action by Israel. Most agree that Israel was required to respond with at most a proportionate use of force in the face of violent resistance; whether the force used was proportionate was disputed. <ref name="washingtonpost1">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/01/AR2010060102934.html?hpid=topnews |title=Israel's flotilla raid revives questions of international law|author=Colum Lynch|publisher=The Washington Post |date=June 1, 2010 |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/afua-hirsch-law-blog/2010/jun/01/gaza-freedom-flotilla-international-law |title=Was the Gaza Flotilla Raid Illegal? |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=Guardian News and Media |accessdate=June 2, 2010 | location=London | date=June 1, 2010 | first=Afua | last=Hirsch}}</ref> . 

Some, such as law experts Harvard Law School Professor [[Alan Dershowitz]], Chicago Law School Professor [[Eric Posner]], and Johns Hopkins International Law and Diplomacy Professor [[Ruth Wedgwood]], said that the naval [[blockade]], the boarding in international waters, and the use of force were in accord with long-standing international law. <ref name="nydailynews1"/><ref name="autogenerated1"/><ref name="autogenerated2"/> Dershowitz compared the blockade with the U.S. blockade of Cuba during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and Posner with the Coalition blockade of Iraq during the first [[Gulf War]]. <ref name="nydailynews1"/><ref name="autogenerated1"/><ref name="autogenerated2"/> .

<blockquote>the Convention on the Law of the Sea stipulates that a coastal state may consider intervention if a ship is engaged in arms and drug smuggling, the slave trade or terrorist activities. However, the case with the aid boats is totally different. They set sail in accordance with the Customs Act and are known to be carrying humanitarian aid, not weapons or ammunition.

With regard to the [[Gaza–Jericho Agreement]], [[Diana Buttu]], a Palestinian-Canadian lawyer and former spokesperson for the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], said that Israel declared the [[Oslo Accords]] dead in 2001, and actually breached the agreements, so that a call to the applicability of the Gaza-Jericho Agreement is not plausible. <ref name="gaza-jericho" /> . 

Guilfoyle told [[Aljazeera]] that, while a blockade is a recognized tool of warfare, a close look should be taken as to whether there was proper notification of the Gaza blockade, and whether it inflicted "excessive  damage to the civilian population in relation to the concrete military advantage expected". <ref name="aljazeera1">{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2010/06/201063114723151689.html |title=Is Israel's blockade legal? - Focus |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=June 3, 2010 |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}</ref> .

Similarly, [[Allen Weiner]], former [[U.S. State Department]] attorney and legal counselor at the American Embassy in [[The Hague]], and now a [[Stanford Law School]] professor, said "the Israeli blockade itself against Gaza itself is not illegal". <ref name="washingtonpost2">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/01/AR2010060102934.html?hpid=topnews |title=Israel's flotilla raid revives questions of international law |publisher=The Washington Post|date= June 1, 2010|accessdate=June 2, 2010 | first=Colum | last=Lynch}}</ref> . 

[[Ruth Wedgwood]], a professor of International Law and Diplomacy at the [[School of Advanced International Studies]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]], said that under the [[law of armed conflict]], which would be in effect given Hamas's rocket attacks on Israel and Israel's responses, Israel has "a right to prevent even neutrals from shipping arms to [Hamas]". <ref name="autogenerated2"/> .

[[Eric Posner]], international law professor at the [[University of Chicago Law School]], noting that the raid had "led to wild accusations of illegality", wrote that blockades are lawful during times of armed conflict (such as the [[Coalition of Gulf War|Coalition]] blockade of Iraq during the first [[Gulf War]]), and that "war-like conditions certainly exist between Israel and Hamas". <ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news|last=Posner |first=Eric |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704025304575284210429984110.html|title= The Gaza Blockade and International Law: Israel's position is reasonable and backed by precedent|work=Opinion|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|format=Subscription only |date= June 4, 2010|accessdate=June 4, 2010}}</ref> He compared Israel's blockade to the [[Union blockade]] by the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] against the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] (a non-state) during the [[U.S. Civil War]]. <ref name="autogenerated1"/>  The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] later affirmed the legitimacy of that blockade. <ref name="autogenerated1"/> . 

Philip Roche, a partner in the shipping disputes and risk management team with the London-headquartered international law firm [[Norton Rose]], also said: "On the basis that Hamas is the ruling entity of Gaza, and Israel is in the midst of an armed struggle against that ruling entity, the blockade is legal."<ref name="is-blockade-legal">{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65133D20100602|title=Q&A: Is Israel's naval blockade of Gaza legal?|publisher=Reuters|date={{date|2010-06-02}}}}</ref>  The basis for that is the law of blockade, derived from international law that was codified in the 1909 [[London Declaration concerning the Laws of Naval War]], and which was then updated in 1994 in the [[San Remo Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea]]--"a legally recognized document". <ref name="is-blockade-legal" />  He addressed the charge by Human Rights Watch that the blockade of a terrorist organization constitutes a collective penalty against civilians, ostensibly violating Article 33 of the fourth Geneva Convention, by saying "This argument won't stand up.

International law Professor [[Ed Morgan (professor)|Ed Morgan]] of the [[University of Toronto]], likewise, noting that it is clear that Israel and Hamas are in a state of armed conflict, which has been noted by the General Assembly to the Human Rights Council in its Goldstone Report, wrote that a blockade of an enemy’s coast is an established military tactic. <ref name="theglobeandmail1">{{cite news|author=Canada |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/israels-naval-blockade-pitches-and-rolls-with-the-law-of-the-sea/article1589981/ |title=Israel’s naval blockade pitches and rolls with the Law of the Sea |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=May 31, 2010 |accessdate=June 4, 2010}}</ref>  He pointed out that it is recognized as a means at the [[Security Council]]’s disposal under Article 42 of the UN Charter, and is similarly set forth in Article 539 of the Canadian Forces manual Counter-Insurgency Operations. <ref name="theglobeandmail1"/> [[Image:Bill Clinton, Yitzhak Rabin, Yasser Arafat at the White House 1993-09-13.jpg|left|190px|thumb|alt=Oslo Accords 1993, hands shaking|[[Yitzhak Rabin]], [[Bill Clinton]], and [[Yasser Arafat]] at the [[Oslo Accords]] signing ceremony in 1993]] He wrote:  <blockquote>Having announced its blockade, Israel had no obligation to take the ships’ crew at their word as to the nature of the cargo.

Professor Wedgwood opined that the goal of the flotilla was to:  "denude Israel of what it thinks it was guaranteed in the 1993 [[Oslo Accords]] which preceded the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, which is the control of the external borders of Gaza and West Bank....

According to [[George Bisharat]], a professor at [[Hastings College of the Law]], Israel's blockade of Gaza was illegal, and enforcing the blockade in international waters was similarly illegal. Bisharat wrote that "flotilla passengers were entitled to defend themselves against Israel's forcible boarding of the Mavi Marmara, whether or not Israeli commandos fired immediately on landing on the ship's deck". <ref>{{cite web|author=George Bisharat |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/06/03/EDGF1DPDK9.DTL#ixzz0puW6Bdk9 |title=Gaza occupation and siege are illegal |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle - Sfgate.com |date=2010-06-04 |accessdate=2011-04-03}}</ref> . 

Turkey's foreign minister [[Ahmet Davutoğlu]] said: <blockquote>High-seas freedom, freedom of navigation, was one of the oldest forms of international law; no vessel could be stopped or boarded without the consent of the captain or flag State.

According to Murray, the [[Law of the Sea]] rules that, when an incident takes place on a ship on the [[high seas]] the applicable law is that of the flag state of the ship on which the incident occurred, so the Turkish ship was Turkish territory. If the Israeli commandos were acting on behalf of the government of Israel in killing the activists on the ships, Israel would be in a position of war with Turkey, and the act would fall under international jurisdiction as a war crime. If, on the other hand, the killings were not authorised Israeli military action, they were acts of murder under Turkish jurisdiction and if Israel does not consider itself in a position of war with Turkey, then it must hand over the commandos involved for trial in Turkey under Turkish law.{{cn|date=March 2012}}.After being later told that the ''Mavi Marmara'' may have been sailing under a Comoran flag, Murray reiterated that Israel's attack was illegal regardless of what flag the vessel was sailing under. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2010/06/whay_was_the_ma.html |title=Why Was the Mavi Marmara Reflagged Just Before Sailing?|publisher=Craig Murray |date=June 3, 2010 |accessdate=June 4, 2010}}</ref> . 

Jason Alderwick, a maritime analyst at the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] of London, said that the Israeli raid did not appear to have been conducted lawfully under the convention. <ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article7141520.ece How the flotilla bound for Gaza Strip sailed into death at sea]. ''[[The Times]]'', UK. June 1, 2010</ref>  Anthony D'Amato, international law professor at [[Northwestern University School of Law]], argued that the San Remo Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea applies to a situation in which the laws of war between states are in force. He said the laws of war do not apply in the conflict between Israel and Hamas, which isn't even a state. He said the law of the [[Geneva Conventions]] would apply. <ref name="washingtonpost1"/> . 

Linda Brayer, an Israeli human rights lawyer who specialized in the laws of war and international law, concludes that:
<blockquote>It follows, therefore, that Israel was first of all not allowed to attack these vessels militarily, and then not to board these vessels by force, capture these vessels, attack the passengers, imprison them on the vessels, forcibly remove them from the vessels, and steal their private property in the form of cameras, computers, clothes, etc. <ref name="lindabrayer">{{cite web|url=http://www.washington-report.org/component/content/article/9667.html |title=WRMEA – Why Israel’s flotilla attack was illegal, Linda Brayer |publisher=Washington-report.org |date=2010-05-31 |accessdate=2011-04-03}}</ref></blockquote>

===Arguments supporting legality of high seas enforcement===. 
The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Israeli Foreign Ministry]] argued that the flotilla's interception was lawful, as Israel had publicly declared its blockade, and had given the ships prior notification, and that activists had made it clear by written and oral statements that they intended to violate the blockade. It further argued that international law allowed a state to enforce a naval blockade in international waters, so long as the blockade did not impede access to the ports or coasts of neutral states. <ref>[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Law/Legal+Issues+and+Rulings/Gaza_flotilla_maritime_blockade_Gaza-Legal_background_31-May-2010.htm The Gaza flotilla and the maritime blockade of Gaza - Legal background 31-May-2010<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . 

Several legal experts{{Who|date=August 2010}} say, under the law of a blockade, intercepting a vessel could apply globally so long as a ship is bound for a "belligerent" territory. <ref name="is-blockade-legal"/> . 

[[Alan Dershowitz]] said that action taken in international waters is permissible if a legal blockade is in effect, and if there is no doubt that the offending ships have made a firm determination to break the blockade. <ref name="nydailynews1"/>  "It's okay for Israeli ships to operate in international waters to enforce [the blockade]," said [[Allen Weiner]]. <ref name="washingtonpost2"/><ref name="sfgate1"/>  Douglas Guilfoyle, a lecturer at [[University College of London]] since 2007 who authored ''Shipping Interdiction and the Law of the Sea'' in 2009, told [[Aljazeera]] that if the blockade was legal, "then yes, a ship could have been intercepted on the high seas, if there was a suspicion it was attempting to breach the blockade."<ref name="aljazeera1"/> . 

[[File:Nato Ships.jpg|thumb|left|alt=NATO and U.S. ships enforcing the [[Operation Sharp Guard]] blockade|NATO and U.S. ships enforcing the [[Operation Sharp Guard]] blockade]]
[[Ruth Wedgwood]], similarly, said that "the right of visit and search under the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|law of the sea]], or under the law of armed conflict, can be conducted on the high seas". <ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/jan-june10/gaza2_06-02.html |title=As Flotilla Inquiry Calls Grow Louder, Legality of Gaza Blockade Examined |publisher=[[PBS NewsHour]]|date=June 2, 2010 |accessdate=June 3, 2010}}</ref>  She pointed out that the U.S. itself, as a neutral throughout most of the 1800s, submitted its ships to inspections on the high seas to allow belligerents to make sure that its cargoes weren't actually fueling any of the European wars. <ref name="autogenerated2"/>  She also noted that the U.S. itself blockaded Cuba during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], and also commented that in the wars in Yugoslavia, the U.N. itself, and NATO, through [[Operation Sharp Guard]], imposed a blockade on shipments to Yugoslavia. <ref name="autogenerated2"/>  Roche also indicated that under the law of a blockade, a ship can be intercepted on the high seas as long as it is bound for the blockaded territory. <ref name="is-blockade-legal" />  Professor Posner, as well, wrote that "longstanding customary international law permits states to enforce publicly announced blockades on the high seas". <ref name="autogenerated1"/>  Professor Morgan also said that under the San Remo law, a blockade is often enforced in what would otherwise be international waters. <ref name="theglobeandmail1"/> . 

[[Mark Regev]], spokesman for the [[Prime Minister of Israel]], referring to the [[International Institute of Humanitarian Law#San Remo Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea (1994)|San Remo Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea]], said:<blockquote>The San Remo memorandum states, specifically 67A, that if you have a boat that is charging a blockaded area you are allowed to intercept even prior to it reaching the blockaded area if you've warned them in advance, and that we did a number of times, and they had a stated goal which they openly expressed, of breaking the blockade. That blockade is in place to protect our people. <ref name=sanremoicrc>''The 1994 San Remo Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea'', by Louise Doswald-Beck, can be found here [http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JMST] and also in the ''[[International Review of the Red Cross]]'', no. 309, pp.583–594</ref><ref name=ABC-Lateline>{{cite web

==Use of force==. 
===Positions that use of force was illegal=== . 

A [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] fact-finding mission was charged by the UN to undertake an investigation of the IDF raid. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=10369&LangID=E|publisher=OHCHR Media Centre|title=UN Fact-finding Mission report on Gaza flotilla - Press Conference}}, 23 September 2010</ref> In its September 2010 report the UN panel found that the IDF broke international law, and that there was evidence sufficient to initiate prosecutions for breaches of the [[Geneva Convention]]. In particular, the panel, after interviewing more than 100 witnesses, found clear evidence for prosecution for the war crimes of "wilful killing; torture or inhuman treatment; wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health" under Article 147 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. <ref name="bbc.co.uk">{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11393836|title=Israeli raid on Gaza aid flotilla broke law - UN probe|date=22 September 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=22 September 2010}}</ref> The report stated that:
:"The conduct of the Israeli military and other personnel towards the flotilla passengers was not only disproportionate to the occasion but demonstrated levels of totally unnecessary and incredible violence.”<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/> . 

The UNHRC fact-finding mission also determined based on both "forensic and firearm evidence" that [[Furkan Dogan]], a 19-year-old [[American citizen]] of Turkish descent, and five Turkish citizens were killed execution-style on May 31 on the [[MV Mavi Marmara|MV ''Mavi Marmara'']] by the Israeli commandos. The report of the fact-finding mission stated that the killing of Dogan and the five Turks by the Israeli commandos "can be characterized as extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions."<ref>Truthout, 2010 Sept. 27, "UN Fact-Finding Mission Says Israelis "Executed" US Citizen Furkan Dogan," http://www.truth-out.org/un-fact-finding-mission-says-israelis-executed-us-citizen-furkan-dogan63609 citing: Human Rights Council, Fifteenth session, "Report of the international fact-finding mission to investigate violations of international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law, resulting from the Israeli attacks on the flotilla of ships carrying humanitarian assistance," http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/15session/A.HRC.15.21_en.pdf</ref> . 

A legal analysis published by the ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'' said that Israeli soldiers had the right to defend themselves,<ref name="autogenerated3"/> but if Israel used force against the ships without legal justification, the crew members had the right to defend themselves. <ref name="FAZ Auf Hoher See" group="text">{{cite news|last=Müller|first=Reinhard|journal=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|title=Auf Hoher See darf kein Zwang ausgeübt werden|date=June 2, 2010|url=http://www.faz.net/s/RubB30ABD11B91F41C0BF2722C308D40318/Doc~E5237CD1680B143708A8E91DACB267CF5~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html|accessdate=June 2, 2010|quote=Den Staaten ist es völkerrechtlich nicht erlaubt, die Hohe See ihrer Souveränität zu unterstellen....

There is no doubt that Israeli soldiers have the right to defend themselves against attacks. If Israel has used force against the ships without legal justification, however, the members of the crew had the right to defend themselves."</ref>  Said Mahmoudi, an international law professor, said that boarding a ship on international waters, killing and capturing civilians is not in line with the law. <ref>{{cite web|author=Karoline Hoppe  |url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/varlden/folkrattsprofessorn-israel-har-brutit-mot-internationell-ratt-1.1115594 |title= Folkrättsprofessorn: Israel har brutit mot internationell rätt |language=Swedish |publisher=DN |date=May 31, 2010 |accessdate=June 4, 2010}}</ref> . 

Minister Davutoğlu called the raid "a grave breach of international law and constituted banditry and piracy - it was "murder" conducted by a State, without justification."  Prominent Turkish jurists characterized Israel's actions as a violation of international law and a "war crime."  Turkey's deputy parliament speaker, [[Uğur Mumcu#Family|Guldal Mumcu]], said in a declaration that "[t]his attack was an open violation of United Nations rules and international law."<ref>{{Cite news |date=June 2, 2010 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jun/02/israel-deport-gaza-flotilla-activists |title=Israel to deport remaining Gaza flotilla activists |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=Guardian News and Media |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=June 2, 2010 | location=London}}</ref> . 

===Positions that use of force was lawful===. 
As to the use of force when boarding a ship in such circumstances, it is legal but must be proportionate, according to Commander James Kraska, professor of international law at the [[U.S. Naval War College]], and Professor Morgan. <ref name="is-blockade-legal" /><ref name="theglobeandmail1"/>  Proportional force does not mean that guns cannot be used by forces when being attacked with knives, but "there has got to be a relationship between the threat and response," said Kraska. <ref name="is-blockade-legal" /> According to J. Peter Pham, a strategic adviser to U.S. and European governments, "from what is known now, it appears that Israel acted within its legal rights."<ref name="is-blockade-legal" /><ref name="theglobeandmail1"/> . 

Professor Posner noted that the "1990 UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force & Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials" is not international law, but rather akin to vague  "best practices" for advising countries with poorly trained police forces, and does not apply to a military operation. <ref name="autogenerated1"/>  He wrote further:  <blockquote>Military operations must respect the principle of proportionality, which is a fuzzy, "know-it-when-you-see-it" test. But one thing is clear. Ships that run blockades may be attacked and sunk under international law. If Israel had exercised that right, far more than nine people would have been killed. <ref name="autogenerated1"/></blockquote> . 

Israeli authorities said marines who boarded the vessel opened fire in self-defense after activists clubbed and stabbed them and snatched some of their weapons. <ref name="is-blockade-legal"/><ref name="sfgate1"/> . 

==Piracy==. 
Under international law, the Israeli raid was considered state action and not piracy. Commander James Kraska said, "Whether what Israel did is right or wrong, it is not an act of piracy. Piracy deals with private conduct particularly with a pecuniary or financial interest."<ref name="is-blockade-legal"/> . 

Professor Morgan says that to describe Israeli actions in this case as "piracy" is "inapt since, under both customary law and Article 101 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, that applies only to acts done for private gain."<ref name="theglobeandmail1"/> Nevertheless, some have used the word to denounce the incident.  . 

==Israeli Supreme Court decisions==. 
[[File:Dorit Beinisch.JPG|thumb|right|170px|alt=Israel Supreme Court President Dorit Beinisch|[[Israel Supreme Court]] President [[Dorit Beinisch]]]]
The [[Israeli Supreme Court]] rejected six petitions, from both leftist groups and rightist groups, against the IDF and Israel in regard to the raid "in the absence of just cause to intervene in the decision of the attorney general."<ref name="jpost1">{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=177365 |title=Court dismisses flotilla petitions |publisher=Jpost.com |date= |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}</ref><ref name="ynetnews2">{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3898429,00.html |title=High Court rejects flotilla suits: Soldiers defended their lives - Israel News, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=June 20, 1995 |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}</ref> Supreme Court President [[Dorit Beinish]] wrote in the Court's decision that:
<blockquote>The soldiers were forced to respond in order to defend their lives. Unfortunately, the action ended, as was not to be expected, with the loss of lives.  Nine people were killed, and soldiers and flotilla participants were wounded.... the soldiers encountered a harsh and violent response.... The soldiers were attacked with knives, clubs, and metal rods. Attempts were made to snatch their personal weapons and to violently injure them. One of the soldiers was even dropped over the side of the ship. <ref name="jpost1"/><ref name="ynetnews2"/></blockquote> . 

The Court defended the decision to prevent the ships from reaching Gaza:
<blockquote>In light of Hamas' control of the Gaza Strip, Israel has take various steps meant to prevent direct access to the Gaza Strip, including the imposition of a naval blockade on the Strip, which, according to the State's declaration, is meant to block the infiltration of weapons and ammunition into Hamas ranks which have carried out shooting and terrorist attacks in Israeli territory for years with the goal of harming civilians.... Among other things, the State offered the flotilla's organizers to unload the cargo carried on the ship and to transfer the shipment ... via Israel. This offer was rejected. <ref name="ynetnews2"/></blockquote> . 

The Court rejected petitions by right wingers (the Shurat HaDin Israel Law Center and the Almagor Terrorist Victims Association) to prevent the release and deportation of activists who attacked the IDF soldiers pending an investigation. <ref name="ynetnews1"/>  The Court supported the attorney general's decision to release the activists, noting that:  <blockquote>After considering the fact that nine of the flotilla's participants were killed and dozens were injured, he reached the conclusion that the public, political, and security interests in this case trump law enforcement. We did not find any ground for intervening in this decision or in the considerations at its foundation. <ref name="ynetnews2"/></blockquote> . 

The Court also rejected three petitions demanding information on the whereabouts of some of the passengers brought to Ashdod. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmaxworld.com/headline_story/Israel_court_flotilla/2010/06/03/316838.html |title=Breaking News, Politics, Commentary from around the world |publisher=Newsmaxworld.com |date=May 31, 2010 |accessdate=June 4, 2010}}</ref>  In one leftist suit, the petitioners initially ascribed "illegal actions" to the State of Israel, calling its actions "massacre, murder, and ... piracy." But the petitioners revoked their petition after receiving the State Prosecutor's response and the Court's comments. <ref name="ynetnews2"/>  The Court observed:  "It is clear that the suit was filed in haste.  Even though the petitioners knew nothing of what had occurred, they did not hesitate to hurriedly place the gravest possible stain on the IDF forces' actions". <ref name="ynetnews2"/> . 

A petition submitted to the Israeli Supreme Court by the al-Jazeera television network, on behalf of journalists working for the network who had been arrested on the ship, requesting their release, was deemed moot as the journalists had already been released. <ref name="ynetnews2"/> . 

==International Criminal Court== . 

Lawyers representing the Turkish victims and the Islamic Turkish NGO [[IHH (Turkish NGO)|IHH]] wrote to [[Luis Moreno Ocampo]], [[prosecutor]] at the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) asking that the Israelis involved be criminally prosecuted before the ICC. <ref name="guardian1">The Guardian (UK), 2010 Oct. 8, "Gaza Flotilla Attack: Calls for International Criminal Court to Step in Turkish Victims Ask International Criminal Court to Pursue Israeli Gunmen over Raid on Ship," http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/08/israel-aid-flotilla-raid-calls</ref> . 

Citizens of states that have signed the treaty that founded the ICC are subject to prosecution for war crimes before the ICC. Although Israel is not a signatory of the ICC treaty, in the lawyer's view the ICC has jurisdiction over the incident in international waters because the Mavi Marmara was sailing under flag of the [[Comoros Islands]] and many Turkish citizens were present onboard, and the Comoros Islands is a signatory to the treaty that established the ICC. Their argument for ICC jurisdiction is supported by prominent international jurists such as [[Desmond da Silva]], a [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] and former UN [[war crimes]] prosecutor. <ref name="guardian1"/> .
