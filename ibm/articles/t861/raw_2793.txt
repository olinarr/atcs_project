Within the scope of global aspirations for a [[civil society|community of nations]], Israel has faced international criticism since its [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] in 1948 relating to a variety of topics,<ref name="Dershowitz Case">{{cite book | first= Alan| last= Dershowitz| authorlink= Alan Dershowitz| quote= The Jewish nation of Israel stands accused in the dock of international justice. The charges include being a criminal state, the prime violator of human rights, the mirror image of Nazism, and the most intransigent barrier to peace in the Middle East.

No nation has been targeted for as much editorial abuse from the worldwide media. No nation has been subjected to more frequent threats of annihilation. No nation has had more genocidal incitements directed against its citizens.  It is remarkable indeed that a democratic nation born in response to a decision of the United Nations should still not be accepted by so many countries, groups, and individuals. No other UN member is threated with physical destruction by other member states so openly and with so little rebuke from the General Assembly or the Security Council. Indeed, no nation, regardless of its size or the number of deaths it has caused, has been condemned as often by the UN and its constituent bodies. Simply put, no nation is hated as much as the Jewish nation. |pages= 1–2|year= 2009 | title= The Case Against Israel's Enemies: Exposing Jimmy Carter and Others Who Stand in the Way of Peace}}</ref><ref name="Hagee">{{cite book | first= John| last= Hagee| authorlink= John Hagee| quote= You look toward the United Nations, which Ambassador Dore Gold calls 'the Tower of Babble'.

International criticism of Israeli government policies is usually expressed within the discipline of [[international law]] and various obligations, real or perceived, that Israel is accused of not complying or fulfilling as a member of United Nations and other international organisations. Criticism of contemporary policies usually relates to issues in the [[Palestinian territories]] such as [[Israeli settlements]], [[Human rights in Israel#Human rights record in the Occupied Territories|human rights of Palestinian Arabs]], the conduct of [[Israeli Defense Forces]] during conflicts and accusations of economic strangulation<ref>Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, Jimmy Carter</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/jul/27/david-cameron-gaza-prison-camp | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Nicholas | last1=Watt | first2=Harriet | last2=Sherwood | title=David Cameron: Israeli blockade has turned Gaza Strip into a 'prison camp' | date=27 July 2010}}</ref> of [[Economy of the Palestinian territories|Palestinian territories]]. Criticism of historical Israeli government policies relate to issues with ongoing consequences such as the [[Lausanne Conference, 1949|refusal to allow]] post-war [[Palestinian refugees]] to return to their homes, and the [[Israeli-occupied territories|invasion, occupation and annexation of neighbouring territories]] and the construction of [[Israeli Settlements|settlements]] therein. Another source of criticism is the friction generated by the conversion issue between Israel's [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|orthodox rabbinate]] and [[Relationships between Jewish religious movements|non-orthodox segments]] of the Jewish diaspora. At one end of the spectrum, these criticisms support attempts to delegitimize<ref>http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/news/want-to-delegitimize-israel-be-careful-who-you-mess-with-1.284184</ref><ref name="Bard">{{cite book | first= Mitchell | last= Bard| authorlink= Mitchell Bard| quote= Israel might be the only country in the world whose right to exist is debated and whose future is questioned. Can you imagine anyone asking whether the United States will survive or whether it should exist? Or anyone saying "no" if asked? |page= 1|year= 2008 | title= Will Israel Survive}}</ref><ref>Eroding Israel’s Legitimacy in the International Arena http://reut-institute.org/en/Publication.aspx?PublicationId=3766</ref> Israel's [[right to exist#Israel|right to exist]]. This has led to an ongoing debate regarding at what point criticism of Israel crosses the line in to [[New antisemitism|antisemitism]].  . 

One of the effects of international criticism has been the impact on social psychology of Israelis - according to a survey more than half of Israelis believe "the whole world is against us", and three quarters of Israelis believe "that no matter what Israel does or how far it goes towards resolving the conflict with the Palestinians, the world will continue to criticize Israel". <ref name="peace index"/> Another effect has been instances of mental abuse and physical attacks on Israelis and Jews in several countries. Aside from the resultant domestic social conflict between those that approve of the criticism and those that do not, there have been diplomatic attempts to isolate Israel from the international community, and encouragement of disinvestment from Israel as a form of informal economic boycott.  . 

Sources of Israel's criticism come from several groups: Jewish and Arab [[Activism|activists]] within Israel and from the [[Jewish diaspora]], the organisations within [[United Nations]], other [[non-governmental organization]]s, and often mass media as part of a [[politico-media complex]]. As with any social issue, [[media bias]] is often claimed by both sides of the Israel criticism debate. Criticism in the United Nations is particularly marked: since 2003, the UN has issued 232 resolutions with respect to Israel, 40% of all resolutions issued by the UN over the period and more than six times that of the second placed country, [[Sudan]]. <ref name="eyeontheunresolution">{{cite web|title=UN Resolutions between 2003 and today by country|url=http://www.eyeontheun.org/browse-un.asp?ya=1&sa=1&ua=1&s=0&tp=1&tpn=Resolution|accessdate=2010-12-11}}</ref> These decisions are usually passed with the support of the [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference|OIC]] countries.  . 

==Criticism of contemporary policies==. 
===Peace process===. 
In February 2011, Netanyahu called German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] to complain about Germany's vote in favor of a resolution at the United Nations Security Council to declare Israeli settlements to be illegal and she responded,"How dare You!  You are the one who disappointed us. You haven't made a single step to advance peace."<ref>Ravid, Barak. [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/merkel-chides-netanyahu-for-failing-to-make-a-single-step-to-advance-peace-1.345539?localLinksEnabled=false "Merkel chides Netanyahu for failing to make 'a single step to advance peace'."] ''Haaretz Newspaper'', 25 February 2011. </ref>  A few days later veteran Israeli diplomat Ilan Baruch resigned saying that Netanyahu's policies were leading to Israel's delegitimization. <ref>Ravid, Barak.

===Israeli settlements===. 
{{Main|Israeli settlement|International law and Israeli settlements}}
The participating High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention,<ref>[http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/5fldpj.htm point 12]</ref> numerous UN resolutions, the [[International Court of Justice]]<ref>[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf paragraphs 95-101 and 120]</ref> and other instances have ruled that Israel's policy of establishing civilian settlements in occupied territories, including in [[East Jerusalem]], is illegal.  . 

Israel's settlement policy has drawn harsh criticism from the United States<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/10/AR2010031000683.html Biden's rebuke on new housing comes as Israel seeks to reaffirm U.S. relations (Washington Post, March 11, 2010)]</ref> and the European Union. <ref>[http://www.consilium.europa.eu//uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/foraff/118727.pdf Statement by EU High Representative Catherine Ashton on demolition and settlements in East Jerusalem (January 10, 2011)]</ref> . 

===Human rights===. 
{{Main|Human rights in Israel}}
[[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) has said Israel operates a "two-tier" judicial system in the occupied [[Palestinian territories]], to an effect which provides preferential services, development, and benefits for Jewish settlers while imposing harsh conditions on Palestinians. In some cases Israel has acknowledged differential treatment of Palestinians, such as barring them from accessing “settler-only” roads and subjecting them to over 500 roadblocks and checkpoints within the West Bank, asserting that the measures are necessary to protect Jewish settlers from attacks by Palestinian armed groups. HRW rejects Israel's rationale, saying that no security rationale can explain many instances of differential treatment of Palestinians, such as permit denials that effectively prohibit Palestinians from building or repairing homes, schools, roads, and water tanks. HRW says that repairing a home "does not under any stretch of the imagination constitute a security threat". <ref>[http://www.hrw.org/en/node/95059/section/2 Separate and Unequal (Human Rights Watch, December 19, 2010) (1. Summary)]</ref> . 

In 2011 the Israeli parliament passed a law criminalizing participation in boycotts of [[Israeli settlement]]s. The law drew criticism from the EU, the United States and the [[Anti-Defamation League]]. <ref>[http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=229252 'EU worried 'Boycott Bill' will effect Israeli free speech' (Jerusalem Post, July 13, 2011)][http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/u-s-on-israeli-boycott-law-freedom-to-protest-is-a-basic-democratic-right-1.372884 U.S. on Israeli boycott law: Freedom to protest is a basic democratic right (Haaretz, July 12, 2011)]</ref> . 

====Assassinations====. 
{{Main|Israeli targeted killings}}
[[Amnesty International]] has harshly condemned Israel's policy of assassination operations targeting individuals. Israeli officials have admitted that the policy exists and is being pursued, saying it helps prevent acts of terrorism from being committed against Israel. Criticism against assassinations has been raised also from the Israeli left, who say assassination policy is "gangster behaviour" unbecoming of a government and is against Israeli law. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/1258187.stm Israel's 'assassination policy' (BBC, August 1, 2001)]</ref> Israel's Supreme Court has ruled that assassinations are illegal, but leaked documents suggest that Israel's army has ignored the ruling. <ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israeli-soldier-faces-jail-for-passing-secrets-to-reporter-2206362.html Israeli soldier faces jail for passing secrets to reporter (The Independent, Feb. 7, 2011)]</ref> . 

====Imprisonments====. 
{{Main|Human_rights_in_Israel#Treatment_of_prisoners}}
[[Amnesty International]] reported that in 2009 hundreds of Palestinians were detained and held incommunicado for extended periods of time by Israel. While most were later released without charge, hundreds were tried before military courts whose procedures often failed to meet international standards for fair trial. According to Amnesty, almost all Palestinian prisoners were held in prisons in Israel in violation of international humanitarian law, which prohibits the removal of detainees to the territory of the occupying power. About 300 children and 550 adults were held without charge or trial for more than a year. <ref name=AMNESTY2009>[http://www.amnesty.org/en/region/israel-occupied-territories/report-2009 Amnesty report on Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories (2009)]</ref> . 

In 2011, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said Israel held thousands of Palestinians as political prisoners, and called on Israel to release them. Ban said the release of political prisoners would "serve as a significant confidence-building measure" and boost prospects of peace in the region. <ref>[http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=37698&Cr=palestin&Cr1 Israel’s release of Palestinian political prisoners could boost peace prospects – Ban (UN News Centre, March 7, 2011)]</ref> Also Amnesty International has called on Israel to release political prisoners, saying "all political prisoners held without charge or trial should be tried in fair trials or immediately released". <ref>[http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=13419 ISRAEL/OCCUPIED TERRITORIES/PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY "Developing a human rights agenda for peace" (Amnesty, 26 March 2001)]</ref> . 

====Torture====. 
{{Main|Palestinian_prisoners_in_Israel#Physical_torture}}
According to Amnesty International, methods of torture used by Israel on Palestinian prisoners include prolonged tying in painful stress positions, sleep deprivation and threats to harm detainees’ families. Beatings and other ill-treatment of detainees are common during and following arrest and during transfer from one location to another. <ref name=AMNESTY2009 /> . 

====Human shields====. 
{{Main|Human shield}}
The IDF used Palestinians as human shields, a practice susequently banned by Israel's High Court of Justice. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4333982.stm | work=BBC News | title=IDF to appeal human shield ban | date=October 12, 2005}}</ref><ref>http://www.haaretz.com/news/idf-to-ask-high-court-to-review-ban-on-human-shield-practice-1.171689</ref>

====Treatment of ethnic minorities====. 
{{Main|Racism in Israel}}
Organizations such as [[Amnesty International]], the [[Association for Civil Rights in Israel]] (ACRI), the Israeli government-appointed [[Or Commission]], and  the United States [[Department of State]]<ref name="state.gov-2004">{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41723.htm |title=Israel and the occupied territories |publisher=State.gov |date=2005-02-28 |accessdate=2010v-07-22}}</ref> have published reports that document racism and discrimination directed towards racial and ethnic groups in Israel.  . 

According to a study commissioned by Israel's Courts administration and Israel Bar Association, Arab Israelis who have been charged with certain types of crime are more likely than their Jewish counterparts to be convicted, and once convicted they are more likely to be sent to prison. The study also found differences in lengths of prison sentences given, with the average prison sentence at nine and a half months for Jews and 14 months for Arabs. <ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/israeli-arabs-more-likely-to-be-convicted-for-crimes-than-their-jewish-counterparts-study-shows-1.376521 Israeli Arabs more likely to be convicted for crimes than their Jewish counterparts, study shows (Haaretz, August 2, 2011)]</ref> . 

Rights groups have said that anti-discrimination employment laws in Israel are rarely enforced. A coalition of nine Israeli rights groups has opposed a practice under which companies can advertise their policy to hire only Jewish Israelis, and no Arab Israelis. Companies advertising under a "Hebrew labour" banner adhere to a segregated employment philosophy originally devised by Jewish immigrants in Palestine in the first half of the 20th century. <ref>[http://www.thenational.ae/news/worldwide/middle-east/israels-rights-groups-condemn-jews-only-businesses Israel's rights groups condemn 'Jews only' businesses (The National, Aug 10, 2011)]</ref> . 

====Criticism at the United Nations====. 
{{See also|Israel, Palestine, and the United Nations|List of United Nations resolutions concerning Israel}}
The UN has issued 232 resolutions with respect to Israel since 2003, representing 40% of all resolutions issued by the UN over the period and more than six times that of the second placed country, [[Sudan]]. <ref name="eyeontheunresolution"/> These decisions, passed with the support of the [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference|OIC]] countries, invariably{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} criticize Israel for its treatment of Palestinians. <ref name="eyeontheun.org">''database search from [http://www.eyeontheun.org/browse-un.asp?y=2007&sa=1&u=1&un_s=0&ul=1&tp=1&tpn=Resolution eyeontheun.org]</ref> . 

According to testimony by pro-Israel lobbyist [[Hillel Neuer]] of [[UN Watch]] to the [[United States Congress]] in January 2011 with respect to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], Israel has been the focus of 70% of approximately 50 condemnatory resolutions by the council, 60% of the ten Special Sessions of the council and 100% of the council's five fact-finding missions or inquiries. <ref>[http://www.unwatch.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=bdKKISNqEmG&b=1313923&ct=9085393 UN Watch Testifies Before U.S. Congress on "The State of Human Rights at the U.N."]</ref> . 

===Weapons of mass destruction===. 
{{Main|Nuclear weapons and Israel}} . 

Israel is seen to possess a nuclear arsenal of about 150 weapons, and Israel has been criticised for maintaining nuclear weapons and for not agreeing to a nuclear-free Middle East zone. In September 2009, the [[IAEA]] passed a resolution that "expresses concern about the Israeli nuclear capabilities, and calls upon Israel to accede to the [[NPT]] and place all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive IAEA safeguards..." <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6103398.stm Q&A: Nuclear disarmament (BBC, May 29, 2010)]</ref> . 

Israel has signed the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] but not ratified it, citing neighbouring states that have not done so either. <ref name=ARMSCONTROLASSOCIATION>[http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/cbwprolif Chemical and Biological Weapons Status at a Glance (Arms Control Association)]</ref> Israel is widely believed to have chemical weapons but officials have never directly admitted it, although in 1990 Science Minister Yuval Neeman threatened to retaliate against an Iraqi chemical-weapons strike "with the same merchandise". <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/28/world/israeli-sees-chemical-option-against-iraqis.html Israeli Sees Chemical Option Against Iraqis (July 28, 1990)]</ref> Israel has not signed the [[Biological Weapons Convention]]. <ref name=ARMSCONTROLASSOCIATION /> . 

===Accusations of apartheid===. 
{{Main|Israel and the apartheid analogy}}
The [[Association for Civil Rights in Israel]] concluded in 2008 that a segregated road network in the West Bank, expansion of Jewish settlements, restriction of the growth of Palestinian towns and discriminatory granting of services, budgets and access to natural resources are "a blatant violation of the principle of equality and in many ways reminiscent of the Apartheid regime in South Africa". <ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/civil-rights-group-claim-israeli-occupation-is-reminiscent-of-apartheid-1056546.html Civil rights group claim Israeli occupation is "reminiscent of apartheid" (The Independent, Dec. 7, 2008)]</ref> . 

Israel has also been accused of apartheid by Michael Ben-Yair, Israel's attorney-general from 1993 to 1996
<ref>{{cite web|last=Ben |first=Michael |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=136433 |title=The war's seventh day – Haaretz Daily Newspaper &#124; Israel News |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2010-05-11 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref> and [[Shulamit Aloni]], who served as Minister for Education under [[Yitzhak Rabin]]. <ref name="English translation">[http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3346283,00.html אכן כן, אפרטהייד בישראל (Ynet News, December 31, 2006 (Hebrew))] [http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0701/S00070/shulamit-aloni-there-is-apartheid-in-israel.htm (English translation)]</ref> . 

===Judaization of Jerusalem===. 
{{Main|Judaization of Jerusalem}}
The judaization of Jerusalem refers to the view that [[Israel]] has sought to transform the physical and demographic landscape of [[Jerusalem]] to correspond with a vision of a united and fundamentally [[Jew]]ish Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty. <ref name=Zink>{{Citation|title=A quiet transfer: the Judaization of Jerusalem|author=Valerie Zink|journal=Contemporary Arab Affairs|volume= 2| issue = 1|date=January 2009|pages=122–133|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a908133056~db=all~jumptype=rss|doi=10.1080/17550910802576148}}This definition is drawn largely from Valerie Zink's, and is supported, among others, by that of Hassassian in Ginat et al., who defines the Judaization of Jerusalem as "impos[ing] a Jewish landscape both physically and demographically."</ref> . 

The [[United Nations]] has criticised Israel's efforts to change the demographic makeup of Jerusalem in several resolutions. All legislative and administrative measures taken by Israel, which have altered or aimed to alter the character, legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem, are described by the UN as "null and void" and having "no validity whatsoever". <ref>[http://www.un.org/depts/dpi/palestine/ch12.pdf THE STATUS OF JERUSALEM (Chapter 12) (UN)]</ref> [[Richard Falk]], an investigator with the U.N. Human Rights Council, said that Israel's expansion of East Jerusalem settlements and evictions of Palestinian residents can "only be described in its cumulative impact as a form of [[ethnic cleansing]]". <ref>[http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=54972 Israel Accused of 'A Form of Ethnic Cleansing' (Inter Press Service, March 23, 2011)]</ref> . 

In a 2008 report, [[John Dugard]], independent investigator for the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], cites the judaization of Jerusalem among many examples of Israeli policies "of [[colonialism]], [[Israeli apartheid|apartheid]] or [[Occupation of Palestine|occupation]]", that create a context in which [[Palestinian terrorism]] is "an inevitable consequence". <ref name=IHT>{{Citation|title=UN expert calls Palestinian terrorism 'inevitable consequence' of Israeli occupation|author=The Associated Press|publisher=International Herald Tribune|date=26 February 2008|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/02/26/news/UN-GEN-UN-Israel.php}}</ref> . 

===The Law of Return=== . 

Israel has enacted a "[[Law of Return]]" that allows persons of Jewish ancestry to assume Israeli citizenship and settle in Israel or the occupied [[Palestinian Territories]]. [[Palestinian refugee]]s cannot apply for return or Israeli citizenship under the law since they are not Jewish. The law has drawn criticism, including from the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies which says the law is a "main example of Israeli laws that discriminate against Palestinian Arabs". <ref>[http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/d96d50d790ad4a47c1256b760047dac7?Opendocument Written statement* submitted by the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, a non-governmental organization in special consultative status (Feb. 18, 2002)]</ref> The [[American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee]] says the contrast between the Law of Return and Israeli opposition to the [[Right of Return]] of Palestinian refugees exhibits "barefaced racism". <ref>[http://www.adc.org/issue_papers/ror/issuepaper30.PDF THE PALESTINIAN RIGHT OF RETURN (ADC issue paper 30, 2001)]</ref> More than 1,000 American Jews have backed a campaign entitled “Breaking the Law of Return”, saying the Law of Return creates an ethnically exclusive citizenship, which they see as unjust. <ref>[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/136153 Left-Wing US Jews Call ’Law of Return’ Racist (Israel National News, Feb. 23, 2010)]</ref> . 

===Comparisons with Nazi Germany===. 
A specific form of criticism of Israel is one that compares the state with [[Nazi Germany]]. Comparisons have included analogies of [[Gaza strip]] with [[concentration camps]], or comparisons of Israeli Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] with Nazi leader [[Joseph Goebbels]]. <ref>

It quoted Princeton professor, [[Richard Falk]], referring to Israel's 'war crimes', 'genocidal tendencies', 'holocaust implications', and 'holocaust in the making'.  It spoke about Israel's 'Nazi-like crimes and human-rights violations'.  It claimed 'Comparing the present day Israel with Nazi Germany one discovers that the majority of the Israeli policies are the exact copies of the Nazi policies.  Nazi Germany had invaded its European neighbors extending  from England to Russia.  Israel had also invaded all its neighboring countries: Egypt, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon.  It is also heavily involved in the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan.  Its tentacles had also reached African countries as far as South Africa, Somalia, Sudan, Angola, and Sierra Leone.'  Continuing the lies and blood libels, the post also asserted: 'Worse than the Nazis Israeli forces used to invade peaceful Palestinian towns, execute men, women, and children in cold blood everywhere and anywhere they encounter them, dynamite their homes on top of their residents, and finally demolish the whole town making room for new Israeli colonies'.  It charged that Israel pursued 'a pre-meditated genocidal plan' against Palestinian Arabs."

The ''[[Washington Post]]'' too, reinforced the comparison with Nazism. [[William Raspberry]] on June 28 wrote of a "bloodbath" in Lebanon. Fellow columnist [[Edwin Yoder]] four days earlier wondered whether Israel was to be a .. 'miniature Middle Eastern Prussia' ruling subject Arab populations by 'blood and iron'. Other newspapers joined the swelling chorus, referring to Israeli armored units as 'Panzers' insisting that Israel sought not security but ''lebensraum'', describing operation ''Peace for Galilee'' as 'genocide' and representing Jerusalem as executing its 'final solution' of the Palestine problem. None, however descended as far as [[William Pfaff]] who began an article on June 21 "Hitler's work goes on". From there he went on to write "What would, of course, allow Hitler to find rest in Hell would be to acknowledge that the Jews themselves, in Israel, have finally given up their troublesome message and accepted his own way of looking at things.'"

==Criticism of historical policies== . 

Criticism of historical Israeli government policies relate to issues with ongoing consequences such as the [[Lausanne Conference, 1949|refusal to allow]] post-war [[Palestinian refugees]] to return to their homes, and the [[Israeli-occupied territories|invasion, occupation and annexation of neighbouring territories]] and the construction of [[Israeli Settlements|settlements]] therein.  .

Palestinian refugees are predominantly the [[Palestinian people]], and their descendants, who fled or were expelled from their homes during and after the [[1948 Palestine War]].  . 

The causes and responsibilities of the exodus are a matter of controversy among historians and commentators of the conflict. <ref>[[Avi Shlaim|Shlaim, Avi]], [http://ccas.georgetown.edu/research-articles.cfm?id=96 "The War of the Israeli Historians."] ''[[Center for Arab Studies]]'', 1 December 2003 (retrieved 17 February 2009)</ref> Whereas historians now agree on most of the events of that period, there remains disagreement as to whether the exodus was the result of a plan designed before or during the war by [[Zionist]] leaders or was an unintended consequence of the war. <ref>[[Benny Morris]], 1989, ''The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947-1949'', Cambridge University Press; [[Benny Morris]], 1991, ''1948 and after; Israel and the Palestinians'', Clarendon Press, Oxford; [[Walid Khalidi]], 1992, ''All That Remains: The Palestinian Villages Occupied and Depopulated by Israel in 1948'', Institute for Palestine Studies; [[Nur Masalha]], 1992, ''Expulsion of the Palestinians: The Concept of "Transfer" in Zionist Political Thought'', Institute for Palestine Studies; [[Efraim Karsh]], 1997, ''Fabricating Israeli History: The "New Historians"'', Cass; [[Benny Morris]], 2004, ''The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited'', Cambridge University Press; [[Yoav Gelber]], 2006, ''Palestine 1948: War, Escape and the Palestinian Refugee Problem'', Oxford University Press; [[Ilan Pappé]], 2006, ''The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine'', OneWorld</ref> . 

Significant international pressure was placed on both sides during the [[Lausanne Conference, 1949|1949 Lausanne Conference]] to resolve the refugee crisis. The parties signed a joint protocol on the framework for a comprehensive peace, which included territories, refugees, and Jerusalem, in which Israel agreed "in principle" to allow the return of all of the Palestinian refugees. <ref name=Pappe9>{{cite book

===Occupation and annexation of neighbouring territories===. 
{{Main|Israeli-occupied territories|International law and the Arab–Israeli conflict|Annexation}}
The territories occupied by [[Israel]] from [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], and [[Syria]] after the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967 have been designated as [[occupied territory]] by the United Nations and many other international organisations, governments and others. They consist of the [[West Bank]], the [[Gaza Strip]] and much of the [[Golan Heights]] and, until 1982, the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. Security Council resolution 242, emphasized "the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war," setting the stage for controversy on the legal status of areas captured in 1967, and in 1948. There are two interpretations of international law this matter:
The Israeli position is that:
* The wars in [[Suez Crisis|1956]] and [[Six-Day War|1967]] were waged by Israel to ensure the state's survival. As most hostilities were initiated by the Arab side, Israel had to fight and win these wars in order to ensure the state's sovereignty and safety. Territories captured in the course of those wars are therefore legitimately under Israeli administration for both security reasons and to deter hostile states from belligerence. 
*In the absence of peace treaties between all the parties at war, Israel has under all circumstances the right to maintain control of the captured territories. Their ultimate disposition should be a result of peace treaties, and not a condition for them.  Even so, Israel asserts that:
**The [[Suez Crisis|1956 war]] was caused by a pattern of Egyptian belligerence against Israel, culminating with the nationalization of the [[Suez Canal]] and the blockage of the canal for Israeli traffic in violation of the [[Convention of Constantinople]] and other relevant treaties, in their view a clear ''casus belli'' (i.e., an act justifying war)
**The [[Six-Day War|1967 war]] was similarly caused by the closing of the [[Straits of Tiran]], the rejection of UN forces in the Sinai desert, and the redeployment of Egyptian forces. Jordan and Syria entered the war in spite of Israeli efforts to keep these frontiers peaceful. 
**The [[Yom Kippur War|1973 war]] was a surprise attack against Israel by Syria and Egypt. 
The Arab position is that:
*The 1956 war was a result of a conspiracy between France, the United Kingdom and Israel in violation of Egypt's sovereignty.  Egypt claimed several legal justifications for refusing Israel use of the Suez Canal, including the right of self-defence. 
*The war in 1967 was an unprovoked act of aggression aimed at expanding the boundaries of Israel, and the territories captured during this war are illegally occupied. 
*As a result, the territories must be ceded in order for peace to be achieved.  .

==Criticism of Israel regarded as antisemitism==. 
{{See also|New antisemitism}}
Some criticisms of Israel or Israeli policies have been characterized as anti-Semitic.    This relation of criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism is often called an "equation" of criticism with anti-Semitism, and the equation is made by some supporters of Israel such as [[Alvin Rosenfeld]] and [[Dina Porat]].  . 

One common source of this equation are proponents of the concept of [[New anti-Semitism]], such as [[Phyllis Chesler]], [[Gabriel Schoenfeld]] and [[Mortimer Zuckerman]], who argue that, since the 1967 [[Six day war]], many criticisms of Israel are veiled attacks on Jews and hence are essentially antisemitic.   Another form of the equation, maintained by [[Abba Eban]],  [[Robert S. Wistrich]], and [[Joschka Fischer]], focuses on criticism of Zionism, and contends that some forms of anti-Zionism, particularly attacks on Israel's right to exist, are anti-Semitic in nature.  . 

Some critics of Israel or Israeli policies, including  [[Ralph Nader]], [[Jenny Tonge]], [[Noam Chomsky]], and [[Desmond Tutu]] suggest that equating criticism of Israel with antisemitism is inappropriate or inaccurate.   Other critics, such as [[John Mearsheimer]],  [[Alexander Cockburn]], [[Norman Finkelstein]], and [[William I. Robinson]], claim that supporters of Israel sometimes equate criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism in a deliberate attempt to prevent legitimate criticism of Israel and discredit critics.  [[Alan Dershowitz]] claims that some enemies of Israel pretend to be victimized by accusations of anti-Semitism, in order to garner support for their position.  . 

One form of criticism of Israel - comparing Israel with Nazi Germany - has received significant attention, and the [[European Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism]] published a report in 2009 suggesting that such comparisons be criminalized as anti-Semitic hate speech.  Criminalization of such comparisons is opposed by [[Paul Craig Roberts]] and [[Antony Lerman]].  . 

===Distinguishing legitimate criticism of Israel from antisemitism===. 
The   European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC) prepared a report in 2003 that distinguished criticism of Israel from anti-Semitism by testing whether "Israel is seen as being a representative of 'the Jew'":  if the speaker is considering Israel as a representative of Jews in general, then anti-Semitism is deemed to be underlying the criticism. <ref>
"Manifestations of Antisemitism in the EU 2002-2003", European Montoring Centre on Racisma and Xenophobia (EUMC), 2003, [http://fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/attachments/AS-Main-report.pdf online], pp 13, 240:
:"ARE ANTI-ISRAELI AND ANTI-ZIONIST EXPRESSIONS ANTISEMITIC?   If we turn to the crucial question of defining the point where anti-Israeli and anti-Zionist expressions are to be considered as antisemitism, then we could conclude, on the basis of our definition of antisemitism, that anti-Israeli or anti-Zionist attitudes and expression are antisemitic in those cases where Israel is seen as being a representative of “the Jew”, i.e. as a representative of the traits attributed to the antisemitic construction of “the Jew”.  But what if the opposite is the case and Jews are perceived as representatives of Israel? What if Jews are criticised or offended for Israel’s policies toward the Palestinians? If we stick to our definition, then, strictly speaking, we would have to qualify hostility towards Jews as “Israelis” only then as antisemitic, if it is based on an underlying perception of Israel as “the Jew”. If this is not the case, then we would have to consider hostility towards Jews as “Israelis” as not antisemitic, because this hostility is not based on the antisemitic stereotyping of Jews...  What should not be considered as antisemitic and therefore does not have to be monitored under the heading of “antisemitism”, is hostility towards Israel as “Israel”, i.e. as a country that is criticised for its concrete policies. Hostility towards Israel as “Israel” (as opposed to criticism of Israel as representative of the stereotypical “Jew”) should only then become a matter of general public concern, when there is explicit evidence that criticism of Israel as “Israel” produces attacks on Jews as either “the Jew” or “Israeli”. If there is no such evidence, the case of criticism and hostility towards Israel as “Israel” should not be part of monitoring activities under the heading of “antisemitism”.

[[Natan Sharansky]], former [[Soviet dissident]] and Israeli Minister, suggested a three-part test to distinguish legitimate criticism of Israel from anti-Semitic attacks.    Sharansky's tests that identify a criticism as anti-Semitic are:<ref>

:"[Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota speaking]  Natan Sharansky … has talked about three ways to determine whether criticism of Israel rises to the level of anti-Semitism. He talks about the three Ds"  Demonization, double standards, and delegitimization.  Demonization - when Israeli actions are blown so far out of proportion that the account paints Israel as the embodiment of all evil;  Double Standards - when Israel is criticized soundly for thing any other government would be viewed as justified in doing, like protecting its citizens from terrorism.  Delegitimization: a denial or Israel's right to exist or the right of the Jewish people to live securely in a homeland."

#Demonization - when Israeli actions are blown so far out of proportion that the account paints Israel as the embodiment of all evil. 
#Double Standards - when Israel is criticized soundly for an action or policy that any other government would be viewed as justified in doing, like protecting its citizens from terrorism. 
#Delegitimization: a denial of Israel's right to exist or the right of the Jewish people to live securely in a homeland.  . 

Demonization and double standards are often used as evidence of anti-Semitism in relation to criticism of Israel. Sharansky believes that some criticisms involve applying an especially high moral standard to Israel, higher than applied to other countries (particularly compared to surrounding countries), yet the only special characteristic of Israel is that it is a Jewish state, hence there is an element of anti-Semitism. <ref>Sharansky, Natan, "3D Test of Anti-Semitism:  Demonization, Double Standards, Delegitimization", in ''Jewish Political Studies Review'' 16:3-4 (Fall 2004), [http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-sharansky-f04.htm online]</ref> . 

Delegitimization was a factor addressed by [[Abba Eban]], who claimed that efforts to deny "the equal rights of the Jewish people its lawful sovereignty within the community of nations" constituted anti-Semitism. <ref>
Quoted by [[Oliver Kamm]], "Chomsky, antisemitism and intellectual standards",  [http://oliverkamm.typepad.com/blog/2005/02/chomsky_antisem.html]:
:Kamm quotes Eban: "There is no difference whatever between anti-Semitism and the denial of Israel's statehood. Classical anti-Semitism denies the equal right of Jews as citizens within society. Anti-Zionism denies the equal rights of the Jewish people its lawful sovereignty within the community of nations. The common principle in the two cases is discrimination". (New York Times, November 3, 1975). 
</ref> [[Dina Porat]] (head of the [[Stephen Roth Institute|Institute for Study of Anti-semitism and Racism]] at [[Tel-Aviv University]]) also characterizes some anti-Zionist ideals as anti-Semitic, because they amount to singling-out Jews for special treatment, while all other comparable groups of people are entitled to create and maintain a homeland.  She contends that anti-Zionism is anti-semitic because it is discriminatory: "...antisemitism is involved when the belief is articulated that of all the peoples on the globe (including the [[Palestinians]]), only the Jews should not have the right to self-determination in a land of their own. Or, to quote noted human rights lawyer [[David Matas]]:  One form of antisemitism denies access of Jews to goods and services because they are Jewish. Another form of antisemitism denies the right of the Jewish people to exist as a people because they are Jewish. Antizionists distinguish between the two, claiming the first is antisemitism, but the second is not. To the antizionist, the Jew can exist as an individual as long as Jews do not exist as a people."<ref>Dina Porat, ''Defining Anti-Semitism'', http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2003-4/porat.htm#_edn23 accessed 15 November 2008   See also [[Emanuele Ottolenghi]] http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/nov/29/comment</ref> . 

===Objections to characterizing criticism of Israel as anti-Semitism=== . 

Several commentators have objected to the characterization of criticism of Israel as anti-Semitism, including [[Michael Prior (theologian)|Michael P. Prior]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Norman Finkelstein]], [[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]], [[Antony Lerman]], [[Ralph Nader]], [[Jenny Tonge]], [[Ken Livingstone]], and [[Desmond Tutu]].    They provide a variety of reasons for objecting to the equation, including stifling free expression, promoting anti-Semitism, diluting genuine anti-Semitism, and alienating Jews from Judaism or Israel.  . 

====Vague and indiscriminate==== . 

[[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]] claims that the American Jewish community regularly tries to blur the distinction between legitimate criticism of Israel and anti-Semitism, and says it is a "slippery slope" to expand the definition of anti-Semitism to include legitimate criticism of Israel. <ref>Lerner:
:"The New York Times reported on January 31 [Patricia Cohen, "Essay Linking Liberal Jews and Anti_Semitism Sparks a Furor", 2007] about the most recent attempt by the American Jewish community to conflate intense criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism. In a neat little example of slippery slope, the report on 'Progressive Jewish Thought and the New Anti-Semitism,' written by [[Alvin H. Rosenfeld]] [and published by American Jewish Committee in 2006], moves from exposing the actual anti-Semitism of those who deny Israel's right to exist—and hence deny to the Jewish people the same right to national self-determination that they grant to every other people on the planet—to those who powerfully and consistently attack Israel's policies toward Palestinians, see Israel as racist the way that it treats Israeli-Arabs (or even Sephardic Jews), or who analogize Israel's policies to those of apartheid as instituted by South Africa."
</ref> . 

Philosophy professor Irfan Khawaja asserts that it is a "false equation" to equate anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism, writing "The point is not that the charge of 'anti-Semitism' should never be made: some people deserve it…. But the equation of anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism is a farce that has gone on long enough, and it’s time that those who saw through the farce said so…"<ref>Khawaja, Irfan, "Poisoning the Well: The False Equation of Anti-Zionism and Anti-Semitism", ''History News Network'', [http://hnn.us/articles/10866.html online], 28 March 2005:
:"… [[Gabriel Schoenfeld|Schoenfeld]] takes umbrage at questions about the power of “the Jewish lobby,” and construes the asking of such questions as evidence of anti-Semitism. In some cases, he thinks that a particular criticism of Israel is overwrought, and takes its being overwrought as evidence of anti-Semitism. In some cases the claim is that a Jewish author is self-hating, which becomes evidence of anti-Semitism. In some cases we are told that a person draws attention to his Jewish friends while criticizing Israel, which only proves that the person wishes to be insulated from charges of anti-Semitism—which proves, in advance of any actual accusation, that he must be an anti-Semite.... The point is not that the charge of “anti-Semitism” should never be made: some people deserve it. Nor must it always be made with trepidation: some people obviously deserve it. Nor must anti-Zionists be thought immune to the charge: too many of them are guilty.... But the equation of anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism is a farce that has gone on long enough, and it’s time that those who saw through the farce said so—at length, if necessary....I’ve mentioned just a few examples here, but whatever its virtues (and there are some, as I’ve been at pains to suggest), the deficiencies I’ve described characterize the “new anti-Semitism” literature as a whole. For examples, consult Phyllis Chesler’s The New Anti-Semitism (pp. 4, 171-179, 182-185), Abraham Foxman’s Never Again: The Threat of the New Anti-Semitism (pp. 17-21), Alan Dershowitz’s The Case for Israel (p. 210), the writings of Bat Ye’or, as well as scattered essays in Rosenbaum’s anthology, Commentary, at WorldNet.Daily, or in your local Jewish paper. The modus operandi is more or less the same: First we are informed, accurately enough, of the existence of the new anti-Semitism. Then we are told that anti-Zionism is now ubiquitously used as a cover for that anti-Semitism. From there we skate imperceptibly to the equation of anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism. And from there we are blackmailed into accepting the equation on pain of being accused of anti-Semitism."

[[Palestine Monitor]], a Palestinian advocacy group, is critical of what it characterizes as a modern trend to expand the definition of the term "antisemitic", and states that the new definitions are overly vague and allow for "indiscriminate accusations". <ref>{{cite web

|title=Anti Anti Semitism With Norman Finkelstein
|date=12 October 2009
}}:  An article reviewing [[Beyond Chutzpah|Finkelstein's book ''Beyond Chutzpah'']]:
:"For a more profound explanation of Israeli's emerging opponents, the Zionist lobby blames 'new anti-Semitism'; a term nebulous and versatile enough to fit most any opponent. Arnold Foster and Benjamin Epstein define it as 'callous indifference to Jewish concerns, a failure to understand the most profound apprehension of Jewish people.' A 2007 British government investigation into racism counted 'perceptions of Anti-Semitism' as an example of it. Naturally such vagaries allow for almost indiscriminate accusations. Phyllis Chesler, author of A New Anti-Semitism casts her net wide to include as Israeli's enemies 'western-based international human rights organisations, western anti-capitalist, anti-globalist, pro-environment, anti-war and anti-racist activists, progressive feminists, Jewish feminists and the left and liberal American media'."
</ref> . 

[[Brian Klug]] argues that anti-Zionism sometimes is a manifestation  antisemitism, but that "[t]hey are separate" and that to equate them is to incorrectly "conflate the Jewish state with the Jewish people."<ref>Klug:
:"There is a long and ignoble history of "Zionist" being used as a code word for "Jew," as when [[Communist Poland]] carried out "anti-Zionist" purges in 1968, expelling thousands of Jews from the country, or when the extreme right today uses the acronym [[Zionist Occupation Government|ZOG]] (Zionist Occupied Government) to refer to the [[US government]]. Moreover, the Zionist movement arose as a reaction to the persecution of Jews. Since anti-Zionism is the opposite of Zionism, and since Zionism is a form of opposition to anti-Semitism, it seems to follow that an anti-Zionist must be an anti-Semite.  Nonetheless, the inference is invalid. To argue that hostility to Israel and hostility to Jews are one and the same thing is to conflate the Jewish state with the Jewish people. In fact, Israel is one thing, Jewry another. Accordingly, anti-Zionism is one thing, anti-Semitism another. They are separate. To say they are separate is not to say that they are never connected. But they are independent variables that can be connected in different ways."</ref> . 

Earl Raab, founding director of the Nathan Perlmutter Institute for Jewish Advocacy at [[Brandeis University]] writes that "[t]here is a new surge of antisemitism in the world, and much prejudice against Israel is driven by such antisemitism," but argues that charges of antisemitism based on anti-Israel opinions generally lack credibility. He writes that "a grave educational misdirection is imbedded in formulations suggesting that if we somehow get rid of antisemitism, we will get rid of anti-Israelism. This reduces the problems of prejudice against Israel to cartoon proportions." Raab describes prejudice against Israel as a "serious breach of morality and good sense," and argues that it is often a bridge to antisemitism, but distinguishes it from antisemitism as such. <ref>Raab, Earl. [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0411/is_4_51/ai_106730943 "Antisemitism, anti-Israelism, anti-Americanism"], ''Judaism'', Fall 2002. </ref> . 

Irfan Khawaja suggests that some legitimate criticisms of Israel are improperly attacked by deliberately conflating them with criticisms that are anti-Semitic in nature. <ref>Khawaja:
:"These claims [that critics of Israel are anti-Semitic] are a textbook example of the fallacy of poisoning the well—the fallacy, in logic, of rebutting someone’s argument by adducing the ulterior motives he might have had for making it.  [[Well poisoning]] is a ubiquitous feature of our misologistic culture, but Hanson’s commission of the fallacy differs from the run-of-the-mill variety by its subtle introduction of the issue of anti-Semitism. The claim here is not the truism that Arab anti-Semitism finds resonance in Europe, but that such interest as “the world” expresses in Palestine is merely a cover for its anti-Semitism.  This claim is a casual instance of a broader trend: the reflexive equation, by defenders of Israel, of anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism, itself part of the emerging literature on “the new anti-Semitism.” Focusing on the undeniable fact that many anti-Zionists are anti-Semites, and that anti-Zionism can easily be used as a disguise for anti-Semitism, writers in this genre simply insist over and over that no one can be an anti-Zionist without simultaneously being an anti-Semite."
</ref> . 

[[Alexander Cockburn]] and [[Jeffrey St. Clair]], in the book [[The Politics of Anti-Semitism]], write "Apologists for Israel's repression of Palestinians toss the word 'anti-Semite' at any critic of what Zionism has meant in practice for Palestinians on the receiving end.  So some of the essays in this book address the issue of what constitutes genuine anti-Semitism - Jew-hatred - as opposed to disingenuous, specious charges of 'anti-Semitism' hurled at rational appraisals of the state of Israel's political, military, and social conduct."<ref>Cockburn, p vii</ref> . 

====Represents Jews as victims==== . 

[[Norman Finkelstein]] and Steven Zipperstein (professor of Jewish Culture and History at [[Stanford University]]) suggest that criticism of Israel is sometimes inappropriately considered to be anti-Semitism due to an inclination to perceive Jews as victims.  Zipperstein suggests that the common attitude of seeing Jews as victims is sometimes implicitly transferred to the perception of Israel as a victim; while Finkelstein suggests that the depiction of Israel as a victim (as a "Jew among nations") is a deliberate ploy to stifle criticism of Israel. 
<ref>
* Zipperstein, p 61:
:Steven Zipperstein, argues that a belief in the State of Israel's responsibility for the Arab-Israeli conflict is considered "part of what a reasonably informed, progressive, decent person thinks." He argues that Jews have a tendency to see the State of Israel as a victim because they were very recently themselves "the quintessential victims."
* Finkelstein p 16:
:"To evade the obvious, another stratagem of the Israel's lobby is playing The Holocaust and 'new anti-Semitism' cards.   In a previous study, I examined how the Nazi holocaust had been fashioned into an ideological weapon to immunize Israel from legitimate criticism.  In this book I look at a variant of this Holocaust card, namely, the 'new anti-Semitism'.  In fact, the allegation of a new anti-Semitism is neither new nor about anti-Semitism.  Whenever Israel comes under renewed international pressure to withdraw from occupied territories, its apologists mount yet another meticulously orchestrated media extravaganza alleging that the world is awash in anti-Semitism.  This shameless exploitation of anti-Semitism delegitimizes criticism of Israel, makes Jews rather than Palestinians the victims, and puts the onus on the Arab world to rid itself  of anti-Semitism rather than on Israel to rid itself of the Occupied Territories.   A close examination of what the Israel lobby tallies as anti-Semitism reveals three components:  exaggeration and fabrication;  mislabeling legitimate criticism of Israeli policy; and the unjustified yet predictable 'spillover' from criticism of Israel to Jews generally."
*Finkelstein p 33:
:"The dominant trope of the new 'new anti-Semitism' is that Israel has become the 'Jew among nations'…. In their 1982 study the Perlmuters pointed out the 'transformation … from anti-Semitism against Jews to anti-Semitism the object of which is the Jews' surrogate: Israel'… The transparent motive behind these assertions is to taint any criticism of Israel as motivated by anti-Semitism and - inverting reality - to turn Israel (and Jews), not Palestinians, in the victim of the 'current siege' (Chesler)."
* Finkelstein quotes four authors (who support the notion of New Antisemitism) who he claims rely on the victim perception:   Chesler, Zuckerman, Cotler, and Schoenfeld
</ref> . 

====Self-hating Jews====. 
{{see also|Progressive Jewish Thought and the New Anti-Semitism}}
[[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]], editor of [[Tikkun (magazine)|Tikkun magazine]],  asserts that the equation of Criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism has resulted in conflict within the Jewish community, in particular, proponents of the equation sometimes attack Jewish critics of Israeli policies as "[[self-hating Jew]]s". <ref>Lerner:
:"Yet there is nothing "new" about this or about this alleged anti-Semitism that these mainstream Jewish voices seek to reveal. From the moment I started Tikkun Magazine twenty years ago as "the liberal alternative to Commentary and the voices of Jewish conservatism and spiritual deadness in the organized Jewish community," our magazine has been attacked in much of the organized Jewish community as "self-hating Jews" (though our editorial advisory board contains some of the most creative Jewish theologians, rabbis, Israeli peace activist and committed fighters for social justice). The reason? We believe that Israeli policy toward Palestinians, manifested most dramatically in the Occupation of the West Bank for what will soon be forty years and in the refusal of Israel to take any moral responsibility for its part in the creation of the Arab refugee problem, is immoral, irrational, self-destructive, a violation of the highest values of the Jewish people, and a serious impediment to world peace."
</ref>  Lerner also claims that the equation of Criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism and the resulting charges of "self hating Jew" has resulted in the alienation of young Jews from their faith. <ref>
Lerner:
The impact of the silencing of debate about Israeli policy on Jewish life has been devastating. We at Tikkun are constantly encountering young Jews who say that they can no longer identify with their Jewishness, because they have been told that their own intuitive revulsion at watching the Israeli settlers, with IDF support, violate the human rights of Palestinian civilians in the West Bank, or their own questioning of Israel's right to occupy the West Bank, are proof that they are "self-hating Jews." The Jewish world is driving away its own young. 
</ref> . 

[[Antony Lerman]] believes that many attacks on Jewish critics of Israel are "vitriolic, ad hominem and indiscriminate" and claims that anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism have been defined too broadly and without reason. <ref>Lerman, "Jews attacking Jews":
:"Anti-Semitism can be disguised as anti-Zionism, and a Jew can be an anti-Semite. In principle, therefore, exposing an alleged Jewish anti-Semite is legitimate. But if you read the growing literature that does this - in print, on Web sites and in blogs - you find that it exceeds all reason: The attacks are often vitriolic, ad hominem and indiscriminate. Aspersions are cast on the Jewishness of individuals whom the attacker cannot possibly know. The charge of Jewish "self-hatred" - another way of calling someone a Jewish anti-Semite - is used ever more frequently, despite mounting evidence that it's an entirely bogus concept.  Anything from strong criticism of Israel's policies, through sympathetic critiques of Zionism, to advocacy of a one-state solution for the Israel-Palestine conflict, is defined as anti-Zionism, when none of these positions are prima facie anti-Zionist. Many attackers endow their targets with the ability to bring disaster and dissolution to the Jewish people, thereby making it a national and religious duty for Jews to wage a war of words against other Jews."
</ref>  Lerman also states that the "redefinition" of anti-Semitism to include anti-Zionism has caused Jews to attack other Jews, because many Jews are leaders in several anti-Zionist organizations. <ref>Lerman: '' Jews attacking Jews'':
:"The equation 'anti-Zionism = anti-Semitism' has thus become the new orthodoxy, and has even earned the seal of approval of the European Union. Its racism and anti-Semitism monitoring center (the [Fundamental] Rights Agency) produced a 'working definition' of anti-Semitism, with examples of five ways in which anti-Israel or anti-Zionist rhetoric is anti-Semitic. The 2006 report of the U.K.'s All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism urged the adoption of the EU definition, and the U.S. State Department's 2008 report 'Contemporary Global Anti-Semitism' is also based on it.  The redefinition of anti-Semitism has led to a further radical change in confronting the phenomenon. Many Jews are at the forefront of the growing number of anti-Israel or anti-Zionist groups. So, perceived manifestations of the 'new anti-Semitism' increasingly result in Jews attacking other Jews for their alleged anti-Semitic anti-Zionism."
</ref> . 

Nicholas Saphir, Chair of the Board of Trustees of the [[New Israel Fund]] in the UK published an open letter defending [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) that operate within Israel to promote civil rights. He said that several organisations such as [[NGO Monitor]], Israel Resource News Agency, [[WorldNetDaily]] and the Near and Middle East Policy Review "associate moral and ethical criticism of any activity by Israel or the policies of its Government as being anti-Israel, anti-Semitic and when conducted by Jews, as evidence of self-hatred."<ref>

:"Several organisations such as the self-styled NGO Monitor, Israel Resource News Agency, WorldNetDaily and the Near and Middle East Policy Review are promoting the view that the work of Human Rights NGOs working in Israel is, by its very nature, anti-Israel. Their charge is to associate moral and ethical criticism of any activity by Israel or the policies of its Government as being anti-Israel, anti-Semitic and when conducted by Jews, as evidence of self-hatred."
</ref> . 

====Scare tactics==== . 

The [[International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network]] is also opposed to the use of the antisemitic label to suppress criticism, and objected to the "fear tactics" employed when the anti-Semitic label was applied to supporters of [[Israel Apartheid Week]], claiming that it was reminiscent of the [[Red Scare|anti-Communist scare tactics of the 1950s]]. <ref>{{cite web

|title=Jewish Canadians Concerned about Suppression of Criticism of Israel
|date=22 March 2009
|author=ISJN: Abigail Bakan, Adam Balsam, Sharon Baltman, et al}}:
:"We are appalled by recent attempts of prominent Jewish organizations and leading Canadian politicians to silence protest against the State of Israel. We are alarmed by the escalation of fear tactics. Charges that those organizing Israel Apartheid Week or supporting an academic boycott of Israel are anti-Semites promoting hatred bring the anti-Communist terror of the 1950s vividly to mind. We believe this serves to deflect attention from Israel’s flagrant violations of international humanitarian law…. We recognize that anti-Semitism is a reality in Canada as elsewhere, and we are fully committed to resisting any act of hatred against Jews. At the same time, we condemn false charges of anti-Semitism against student organizations, unions, and other groups and people exercising their democratic right to freedom of speech and association regarding legitimate criticism of the State of Israel."
</ref> . 

[[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]]  suggests that some United States politicians are reluctant to criticise Israel because they are afraid of being labelled  anti-Semitic. <ref>
Lerner:
:"But the most destructive impact of this new Jewish Political Correctness is on American foreign policy debates. We at Tikkun have been involved in trying to create a liberal alternative to AIPAC and the other Israel-can-do-no-wrong voices in American politics. When we talk to Congressional representatives who are liberal or even extremely progressive on every other issue, they tell us privately that they are afraid to speak out about the way Israeli policies are destructive to the best interests of the United States or the best interests of world peace—lest they too be labeled anti-Semitic and anti-Israel. If it can happen to Jimmy Carter, some of them told me recently, a man with impeccable moral credentials, then no one is really politically safe."
</ref>  Lerner also states that groups that promote peace in the mid-East are afraid to form coalitions, lest they be discredited by what Lerner terms the "Jewish Establishment". <ref>
Lerner:
"Even better if we could succeed in creating a powerful alternative to AIPAC. Unfortunately, that path is not so easy. When we approached some of the Israel peace groups to form an alliance with us to build the alternative to AIPAC we found that the hold of the Jewish Establishment was so powerful that it had managed to seep into the brains of people in organizations like Americans for Peace Now (not the Israeli group Peace Now which has been very courageous), Brit Tzedeck ve'Shalom and the Israel Policy Forum or the Religious Action Center of the Reform movement. As a result  these peace voices are continually fearful that they will be "discredited" if they align with each other and with us to create this alternative to AIPAC. Meanwhile, while they look over their right shoulders fearfully, the very people that they fear will "discredit" them for aligning with each other and with us are already discrediting them as much as they possibly can."
</ref> . 

====Draws attention away from genuine antisemitism==== . 

[[Brian Klug]] asserts that proponents of New Antisemitism define antisemitism so broadly that they deprive the term "antisemitism" of all meaning.   Klug writes: " when anti-Semitism is everywhere, it is nowhere. And when every anti-Zionist is an anti-Semite, we no longer know how to recognize the real thing--the concept of anti-Semitism loses its significance."<ref>
Klug:
:"In defense of her [Chesler's] assertion that there is a global "war against the Jews," Chesler wields the ultimate weapon. "In my opinion," she says, "anyone who denies that this is so or who blames the Jews for provoking the attacks is an anti-Semite." Since I deny that there is such a war, this makes me an anti-Semite. But since her argument empties the word of all meaning, I do not feel maligned. In his contribution to A New Antisemitism?, historian Peter Pulzer, faulting the way "the liberal press" sometimes reports the activities of the Israel Defense Forces in the occupied territories, makes a telling point about the misuse of words. He says: "When every civilian death is a war crime, that concept loses its significance. When every expulsion from a village is genocide, we no longer know how to recognize genocide. When Auschwitz is everywhere, it is nowhere." Point taken. But equally, when anti-Semitism is everywhere, it is nowhere. And when every anti-Zionist is an anti-Semite, we no longer know how to recognize the real thing--the concept of anti-Semitism loses its significance."
</ref> . 

In the book [[The Politics of Anti-Semitism]] Scott Handleman writes: "Partisans of Israel often make false accusations of anti-Semitism to silence Israel's critics.  The 'antisemite'  libel is harmful not only because it censors debate about Israel's racism and human rights abuses but because it trivializes the ugly history of Jew-hatred."<ref>Handleman, Scott, "Trivializing Jew-Hatred," in ''[[The Politics of Anti-Semitism]]'', ed. [[Alexander Cockburn]].  AK Press, 2003, p. 13. </ref> . 

====Excessive accusations of antisemitism may result in backlash==== . 

[[Brian Klug]] argues that excessive claims of anti-Semitism (leveled at critics of Israel) may backfire and contribute to anti-Semitism, and he writes "a McCarthyite tendency to see anti-Semites under every bed, arguably contributes to the climate of hostility toward Jews"<ref>
Klug:
:"a McCarthyite tendency to see anti-Semites under every bed, arguably contributes to the climate of hostility toward Jews. The result is to make matters worse for the very people these authors mean to defend."
</ref> . 

[[Tony Judt]] also suggests that Israel's "insistent identification" of criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism is now the leading source of anti-Jewish sentiment in the world. <ref>
*Judt:
:"In many parts of the world this is in danger of becoming a self-fulfilling assertion: Israel's reckless behavior and insistent identification of all criticism with anti-Semitism is now the leading source of anti-Jewish sentiment in Western Europe and much of Asia. But the traditional corollary - if anti-Jewish feeling is linked to dislike of Israel then right-thinking people should rush to Israel's defense - no longer applies. Instead, the ironies of the Zionist dream have come full circle: For tens of millions of people in the world today, Israel is indeed the state of all the Jews. And thus, reasonably enough, many observers believe that one way to take the sting out of rising anti-Semitism in the suburbs of Paris or the streets of Jakarta would be for Israel to give the Palestinians back their land."
*See also Finkelstein, p xxxv:
:"In a feature ''Haaretz'' article marking the fifty-eighth anniversary of Israel's founding, a leading American-Jewish academic now gives expression to the identical analysis: 'Israel's reckless behavior and insistent identification of all criticism with anti-Semitism' Tony Judt writes, 'is now the leading source of anti-Jewish sentiment in Western Europe and much of Asia …. One way to take the sting out of rising anti-Semitism in the suburbs of Paris or the streets of Jakarta would be force Israel to give the Palestinians back their land'." [Finkelstein is citing Judt]
</ref> . 

[[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]] echos those thoughts and suggests that the continued "repression" of criticism of Israel may eventually "explode" in an outburst of genuine anti-Semitism. <ref>
Lerner:
:"When this bubble of repression of dialogue explodes into open resentment at the way Jewish Political correctness has been imposed, it may really yield a "new" anti-Semitism. To prevent that, the voices of dissent on Israeli policy must be given the same national exposure in the media and American politics that the voices of the Jewish establishment have been given.... We hope that the creation of our interfaith Network of Spiritual Progressives (NSP at spiritualprogressives.org) can provide a safe context for this kind of discussion among the many Christians, Muslims, Unitarians, Hindus, Buddhists and secular-but-not-religious people who share some of the criticisms of Israel and who will eventually try to challenge the kind of anti-Semitism that might be released against Jews once the resentment about Jewish Political Correctness on Israel does explode."
</ref> . 

====Attacking the messenger rather than the message==== . 

[[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]] claims that some supporters of Israel refuse to discuss legitimate criticisms of Israel (such as comparisons with [[apartheid]]) and instead attack the people who raise such criticisms, thus deliberately "shifting the discourse to the legitimacy of the messenger and thus avoiding the substance of the criticisms". <ref>
Lerner:
:"The Anti-Defamation League sponsored a conference on this same topic in San Francisco on January 28, conspicuously failing to invite Tikkun, Jewish Voices for Peace and Brit Tzedeck ve Shalom, the three major Jewish voices critiquing Israeli policy, yet also strong supporters of Israel's security. Meanwhile, the media has been abuzz with stories of Jews denouncing former President Jimmy Carter for his book Palestine: Peace or Apartheid. The same charges of anti-Semitism that have consistently been launched against anyone who criticizes Israeli policy is now being launched against the one American leader who managed to create a lasting (albeit cold) peace between Israel and a major Arab state (Egypt). Instead of seriously engaging with the issues raised (e.g. to what extent are Israel's current policies similar to those of apartheid and to what extent are they not?), the Jewish establishment and media responds by attacking the people who raise these or any other critiques--shifting the discourse to the legitimacy of the messenger and thus avoiding the substance of the criticisms. Knowing this, many people become fearful that they too will be labeled "anti-Semitic" if they question the wisdom of Israeli policies or if they seek to organize politically to challenge those policies."

====Exaggerating the equation in order to draw sympathy==== . 

[[Alan Dershowitz]] distinguishes between legitimate criticism of Israel and anti-Semitism, but he claims that some "enemies of Israel" encourage the equation of the two, because it makes the enemies appear to be victims of false accusations of anti-Semitism, which the enemies use in an attempt to gain sympathy for their cause. <ref>
Dershowitz: ''The Case Against Israel's Enemies'', pp 3-4:
:"No one should ever confuse criticism of Israel or of Israeli policies with anti-Semitism.  And no one should ever accuse mere critics of Israel with anti-Semitism.  If criticism of Israel or Israeli policies constituted anti-Semitism then the highest concentration of anti-Semites would be in Israel, where everybody is a critic… The claim that critics of Israel are branded as anti-Semites is a straw man and a fabrication of Israel's enemies who seek to play the victim card.  Yet this big lie persists.  Susannah Heschel, a professor of Jewish studies at Dartmouth, has charged, 'We often hear that criticism of Israel is equivalent to anti-Semitism'.  Michael Lerner, the editor of ''Tikkun'', has made a similar charge.  So has [[Noam Chomsky]].  More recently, a vocal professor at Harvard, [[J. Lorand Matory|Lorand Matory]], has made this accusation…. [[Thomas Friedman]] of the New York Times [wrote]… 'Criticizing Israel is not anti-Semitism, and saying so is vile.  But singling out Israel for opprobrium and international sanction - out of all proportion to any other party in the Middle East - is anti-Semitism, and no saying so is dishonest."

==Suppression of criticism==. 
{{see|Israel lobby in the_United States#Responses to criticism of Israel}} . 

A number of commentators have debated whether public criticism of Israel is suppressed outside of Israel, particularly within the United States.  . 

[[Stephen Zunes]] writes that "assaults on critics of Israeli policies have been more successful in limiting open debate, but this gagging censorship effect stems more from ignorance and liberal guilt than from any all-powerful Israel lobby."<ref name="StephenZunesFPIC">[[Stephen Zunes]], [http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/3270 The Israel Lobby: How Powerful is it Really?], [[Foreign Policy in Focus]], May 16, 2006. Retrieved August 27, 2006. </ref> He goes on to explain that while "some [[criticism of Israel]] really is rooted in [[anti-Semitism]]," it is his opinion that some members of the Israel lobby cross the line by labeling intellectually honest critics of Israel as anti-Semitic. <ref name=StephenZunesFPIC/></blockquote> Zunes argues that the mainstream and conservative Jewish organizations have "created a climate of intimidation against many who speak out for peace and human rights or who support the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]]' right of [[self-determination]]."<ref name=StephenZunesFPIC/> Zunes has been on the receiving end of this criticism himself "As a result of my opposition to US support for the Israeli government's policies of occupation, colonization and repression, I have been deliberately misquoted, subjected to slander and libel, and falsely accused of being "anti-Semitic" and "supporting terrorism"; my children have been harassed and my university's administration has been bombarded with calls for my dismissal."<ref name=StephenZunesFPIC/> . 

In an opinion piece for ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Jimmy Carter]] wrote that mainstream American politics does not give equal time to the Palestinian side of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and that this is due at least in part to AIPAC. <ref>Jimmy Carter, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/story/0,,1970058,00.html Israel, Palestine, peace and apartheid], Guardian Newspaper</ref>  [[George Soros]] pointed out that there are risks associated with what was in his opinion a suppression of debate:<blockquote>
"I do not subscribe to the myths propagated by enemies of Israel and I am not blaming Jews for anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism predates the birth of Israel. Neither Israel's policies nor the critics of those policies should be held responsible for anti-Semitism. At the same time, I do believe that attitudes toward Israel are influenced by Israel's policies, and attitudes toward the Jewish community are influenced by the pro-Israel lobby's success in suppressing divergent views."<ref>Soros, George.

===Criticism stifled by accusations of antisemitism===. 
Several commentators have asserted that supporters of Israel attempt to stifle legitimate criticism of Israel by unfairly labeling critics as [[antisemitic]].  . 

[[Image:Norman finkelstein suffolk.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Norman Finkelstein]] author of ''Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History'']]
One of the major themes of Norman Finkelstein's book [[Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History]] is that some supporters of Israel employ accusations of anti-Semitism to attack critics of Israel, with the goal of discrediting the critics and silencing the criticism. <ref>Finkelstein.  This is a major theme of the book, but is especially discussed in the Introduction and chapter 1. </ref> . 

Professors [[Judy Rebick]] and [[Alan Sears]], in response to [[Israel Apartheid Week]] activities at [[Carleton University]], wrote a open letter to the University president which stated that accusations of anti-Semitism are sometimes made with the goal of "silencing" criticism of Israel. <ref>
*Sears, Alan and Rebick, Judy, "Memo to Minister Kenney: Criticism of Israel is not anti-Semitism",  [http://www.rabble.ca/news/memo-minister-kenney-criticism-israel-not-anti-semitism online]:
:"Defenders of Israeli policy routinely attempt to direct our attention to abuses happening in other places and insist that a hidden agenda must underlie any focus on Israeli brutality in this unjust world. This argument would lead to paralysis in human rights activism by claiming that one must address all cases at once, or only the "worst" cases. Should we have told Rosa Parks, who refused to go the back of a segregated bus in Alabama in 1955, to quit whining as conditions were even worse in South Africa, or colonized Kenya, or for that matter for Palestinians in refugee camps?  The deployment of anti-Semitism as an accusation to silence criticism of Israel is also a serious setback in genuine struggles against anti-Semitism and other forms of discrimination. It is based on a claim that the State of Israel is the single outcome of the history of the Jewish people, the final end of generations of diasporic existence. It attempts to make the Zionist project of a Jewish nation the only legitimate project for all Jews."
*They were writing regarding Israel Apartheid Week controversy described [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1067277.html in Haaretz]. 
</ref> . 

Journalist Peter Beaumont also claims that some proponents of the concept of New Antisemitism  conflate criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism. <ref>Beaumont, Peter,  [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/worldview/story/0,11581,651685,00.html "The new anti-semitism?"], ''The Observer'', February 17, 2002:
:"But the problem with all this talk of a 'new anti-Semitism' is that those who argue hardest for its inexorable rise are dangerously conflating two connected but critically separate phenomena. The monster that they have conjured from these parts is not only something that does not yet exist - and I say 'yet' with caution - but whose purported existence is being cynically manipulated by some in the Israeli government to try to silence debate about the policies of the Sharon government…. As data collected by the Stephen Roth Institute at Tel Aviv University, and other research, makes clear, the rise in anti-Semitism in Europe coincided with the beginning of al-Aqsa intifada - and Israel's heavy-handed response…. What they are talking about is the criticism in the media and political classes of Europe of the policies of Sharon. Israel's brutal response to the often equally reprehensible anti-Israeli Palestinian violence of the intifada has produced one of the most vigorous media critiques of Israel's policies in the European media in a generation. The reply to this criticism, say those most vocal in reporting the existence of the new anti-Semitism, particularly in the Israeli press, is devastating in its simplicity: criticise Israel, and you are an anti-Semite just as surely as if you were throwing paint at a synagogue in Paris."
</ref> . 

[[Tariq Ali]], a British-Pakistani historian and political activist, argues that the concept of new antisemitism amounts to an attempt to subvert the language in the interests of the State of Israel. He writes that the campaign against "the supposed new 'anti-semitism'" in modern Europe is a "cynical ploy on the part of the Israeli Government to seal off the Zionist state from any criticism of its regular and consistent brutality against the Palestinians....  Criticism of Israel can not and should not be equated with anti-semitism." He argues that most pro-Palestinian, anti-Zionist groups that emerged after the [[Six-Day War]] were careful to observe the distinction between anti-Zionism and antisemitism. <ref name=Ali>[[Tariq Ali|Ali, Tariq]]. [http://www.counterpunch.org/ali03042004.html "Notes on Anti-Semitism, Zionism and Palestine"], ''Counterpunch'', March 4, 2004, first published in ''il manifesto'', February 26, 2004. </ref> . 

[[Jewish Voice for Peace]] has spoken against the abuse of the antisemitic label, for example   in an opinion piece, they wrote "For decades, some leaders of the Jewish community have made the preposterous claim that there is complete unity of belief and interest between all Jews and the Israeli government, no matter what its policies. They must believe their own propaganda, because they see no difference between criticism of the Israeli government and anti-Semitism, and they do everything they can to silence critical voices. If the brand of anti-Semitism is not sufficiently intimidating, the silencing has been enforced by organized phone and letter-writing campaigns, boycotts, threats of, and actual withdrawal of funding support from 'offending' institutions and individuals."<ref>{{cite web

|title=On Criticism of Israel and Anti-Semitism
|author=Henri Picciotto}}</ref> . 

====Accusations are public relations efforts==== . 

[[John Mearsheimer]] and [[Stephen Walt]] suggest that the accusations of anti-Semitism leveled at critics of Israel are deliberately timed to defuse the impact of the criticisms.  They describe a pattern where accusations of anti-Semitism rise immediately following aggressive actions by Israel:  following the [[Six-Day War]], following the [[1982 Lebanon War]], and following exposure of "brutal behavior in the Occupied Territories" in 2002. <ref>
Mearsheimer and Walt, p 190:
:"Supporters of Israel have a history of using fears of a "new antiSemitism" to shield Israel from criticism. In 1974, when Israel was under increasing pressure to withdraw from the lands it had conquered in 1967, Arnold Forster and Benjamin Epstein of the ADL published ''The New Anti-Semitism'', which argued that anti-Semitism was on the rise and exemplified by the growing unwillingness of other societies to support Israel's actions. In the early 1980s, when the invasion of Lebanon and Israel's expanding settlements triggered additional criticisms, and when U.S. arms sales to its Arab allies were hotly contested, then ADL head Nathan Perlmutter and his wife, Ruth Ann Perlmutter, released ''The Real Anti-Semitism in America'', which argued that anti-Semitism was on its way back, as shown by the pressure on Israel to make peace with the Arabs and by events like the sale of AWACS aircraft to Saudi Arabia.  The Perlmutters also suggested that many "anti-Semitic" actions, which they define as acts not motivated by hostility to Jews, may nonetheless harm Jewish interests (and especially Israel's well-being), and could easily bring back genuine anti-Semitism.  The troubling logic of this argument is revealed by the fact that there was little mention of anti-Semitism during the 1990s, when Israel was involved in the Oslo peace process. Indeed, one Israeli scholar wrote in 1995 that 'never before, at least since the time Christianity seized power over the Roman Empire, has anti-Semitism been less significant than at present'.  Charges of anti-Semitism became widespread only in the spring of 2002, when Israel came under severe criticism around the world for its brutal behavior in the Occupied Territories. … Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet dissident who is now a prominent Israeli author and politician, declares, 'The new anti-Semitism appears in the guise of 'political criticism of Israel', consisting of a discriminating approach and double standard towards the state of the Jews, while questioning its right to exist.'  The implication is that any one who criticizes Israel's actions … is opposed to its existence and is therefore hostile to Jews.  But this is a bogus charge, because it conflates criticism of Israel's actions with the rejection of Israel's legitimacy."
</ref> . 

[[Norman Finkelstein]] says that to further a public relations campaign, apologists for Israel make accusations of what they call a "[[New Antisemitism|new anti-Semitism]]" against those they oppose, and that they do so deliberately in order to undermine critics and bolster the nation's image. <ref>
Finkelstein:
*page xxxiii:
:"The 'new anti-Semitism' is a spin-off of the Holocaust industry.  Whenever Israel comes under international pressure to resolve its conflict with the Palestinians diplomatically or faces a public relations debacle, its apologists mount a campaign alleging that the world is awash in a new anti-Semitism.  … the purpose of these periodic extravaganzas is not hard to find:  on the one hand, the perpetrators are turned into the victims, putting the spotlight on the alleged suffering of Jews today and diverting it from the real suffering of Palestinians; on the other hand, they  discredit all criticism of Israeli policy as motived by an irrational loathing of Jews."
*page 16:
:"To evade the obvious, another stratagem of the Israel's lobby is playing The Holocaust and 'new anti-Semitism' cards.   In a previous study, I examined how the Nazi holocaust had been fashioned into an ideological weapon to immunize Israel from legitimate criticism.  In this book I look at a variant of this Holocaust card, namely, the 'new anti-Semitism'.  In fact, the allegation of a new anti-Semitism is neither new nor about anti-Semitism.  Whenever Israel comes under renewed international pressure to withdraw from occupied territories, its apologists mount yet another meticulously orchestrated media extravaganza alleging that the world is awash in anti-Semitism.  This shameless exploitation of anti-Semitism delegitimizes criticism of Israel, makes Jews rather than Palestinians the victims, and puts the onus on the Arab world to rid itself  of anti-Semitism rather than on Israel to rid itself of the Occupied Territories.   A close examination of what the Israel lobby tallies as anti-Semitism reveals three components:  exaggeration and fabrication;  mislabeling legitimate criticism of Israeli policy; and the unjustified yet predictable 'spillover' from criticism of Israel to Jews generally."
</ref>  Finkelstein also asserts that "American Jewish organizations" purposefully increase vocal accusations of anti-Semitism during episodes when Israel is coming under increased criticism (such as the during the Intifada), with the goal of discrediting critics of Israel. <ref>
Finkelstein: [http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/5104]
:"Whenever Israel faces a public relations debacle such as the Intifada or international pressure to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict, American Jewish organizations orchestrate this extravaganza called the 'new anti-Semitism.' The purpose is several-fold. First, it is to discredit any charges by claiming the person is an anti-Semite. It's to turn Jews into the victims, so that the victims are not the Palestinians any longer. As people like Abraham Foxman of the ADL put it, the Jews are being threatened by a new holocaust. It's a role reversal – the Jews are now the victims, not the Palestinians. So it serves the function of discrediting the people leveling the charge. It's no longer Israel that needs to leave the Occupied Territories; it's the Arabs who need to free themselves of the anti-Semitism."

====Critics of Israel that have been accused of antisemitism====. 
Critics of Israel that have been accused of antisemitism and have denied the allegation include [[Ralph Nader]], [[John Mearsheimer]], [[Cindy Sheehan]], [[Jenny Tonge]], [[Ken Livingstone]], and [[Desmond Tutu]].  . 

Professor [[J. Lorand Matory]] is a vocal critic of Israel who supports [[disinvestment from Israel]].  [[Larry Summers]], president of Harvard, called efforts by Matory and others to divest from Israel "[[anti-Semitic]] in effect, if not intent."<ref>[http://www.thejusticeonline.com/news/2002/10/29/News/Divestment.Forum.Held.At.Harvard-309328.shtml Divestment forum held at Harvard,  Michaela May, The Justice, 10/29/02]</ref>  According to Matory,  "the knee jerk accusation that targeted criticism of Israel singles out Israel is as absurd as stating that the anti-apartheid movement was singling out South Africa."<ref name="Crimson2006">[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=513616 Summers Says British Boycott of Israeli Academics Is Intentionally 'Anti-Semitic']</ref> . 

Professor [[Noam Chomsky]] argues that Israel's foreign minister  [[Abba Eban]] equated anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism in an effort to "exploit anti-racist sentiment for political ends", citing statement Eban made in 1973: "One of the chief tasks of any dialogue with the Gentile world is to prove that the distinction between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism is not a distinction at all." Commenting on Eban's statement, Chomsky replied: "That is a convenient stand.  It cuts off a mere 100 percent of critical comment!"<ref>Quoted by Menachem Wecker, "In Defense of Self-Hating Jews", May 2007, Jewish Currents, online at [http://www.jewishcurrents.org/2007-may-wecker.htm]. </ref>  In 2002, Chomsky wrote that this equation of anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism was being extended to criticism of Israeli policies, not just criticism of Zionism.  Chomsky also wrote that, when the critics of Israel are Jewish, the accusations of anti-Semitism involve descriptions of [[Self-hating Jew|self-hatred]]. <ref>
*Chomsky, ''Necessary Illusions'', p 316:
:"There have long been efforts to identify anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism in an effort to exploit anti-racist sentiment for political ends; 'one of the chief tasks of any dialogue with the Gentile world is to prove that the distinction between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism is not a distinction at all,' Israeli diplomat Abba Eban argued, in a typical expression of this intellectually and morally disreputable position (Eban, Congress Bi-Weekly, March 30, 1973). But that no longer suffices. It is now necessary to identify criticism of Israeli policies as anti-Semitism -- or in the case of Jews, as 'self-hatred,' so that all possible cases are covered."
</ref>  In 2004, Chomsky said "If you identify the country, the people, the culture with the rulers, accept the totalitarian doctrine, then yeah, it's anti-Semitic to criticize the Israeli policy, and anti-American to criticize the American policy, and it was anti-Soviet when the dissidents criticized Russian policy. You have to accept deeply totalitarian assumptions not to laugh at this."<ref>{{cite web

Quoted by [[Oliver Kamm]] http://oliverkamm.typepad.com/blog/2005/02/chomsky_antisem.html
"Chomsky, antisemitism and intellectual standards"
"But note that by 2002, in his remarks to the Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign, Chomsky is giving a flatly different account of Eban’s argument. What Eban is saying in the genuine quotation is that the denial of Israel’s statehood is equivalent to antisemitism. This is not at all the same thing as claiming that criticism of Israeli policies is equivalent to antisemitism. Chomsky’s interpolation – “By anti-Zionism he meant criticisms of the current policies of the State of Israel” – is not remotely supportable from the quotation. Chomsky has doctored his source in order to set up a straw man."

Musician [[Roger Waters]] is a critic of Israel's treatment of Palestinians, and was accused by the [[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]] of using anti-Semitic imagery in one of his recent musical productions.  Waters responded by stating that the ADL regularly portrays critics of Israel as anti-Semitic, and that "it is a screen they [the ADL] hide behind". <ref>

:"Abraham Foxman, the director of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), said using the dollar sign and the Star of David in sequence [during Water's performance] echoed the stereotype that Jews were avaricious.  Referring to criticism Waters has previously made of Israel for its treatment of the Palestinians, Mr Foxman said the musician should have 'chosen some other way to convey his political views without playing into and dredging up the worst age-old anti-Semitic stereotype about Jews and their supposed obsession with making money'. …  [Waters replied:]  'If I don't respond [to the suggestion of antisemitism] people will see the story and will come to believe I'm anti-Semitic, and I'm not. Nothing could be further from the truth….'  Waters has spoken against Israeli policies and accused the ADL of painting critics as anti-Semitic. 'It's a screen that they hide behind. I don't think they should be taken seriously on that. You can attack Israeli policy without being anti-Jewish,' he [Waters] said."

In 2002 [[Desmond Tutu]] is a critic of Israel who has compared Israel's policies to apartheid South Africa.  Tutu wrote that criticism of Israel is suppressed in the United States, and that criticisms of Israel are "immediately dubbed anti-Semitic". <ref>

:" I've been very deeply distressed in my visit to the Holy Land; it reminded me so much of what happened to us black people in South Africa. I have seen the humiliation of the Palestinians at checkpoints and roadblocks, suffering like us when young white police officers prevented us from moving about.... But you know as well as I do that, somehow, the Israeli government is placed on a pedestal [in the US], and to criticise it is to be immediately dubbed anti-semitic, as if the Palestinians were not semitic. I am not even anti-white, despite the madness of that group. And how did it come about that Israel was collaborating with the apartheid government on security measures?  People are scared in this country [the US], to say wrong is wrong because the Jewish lobby is powerful - very powerful."

[[Michael Prior (theologian)|Michael Prior]] was a vocal critic of Israel's treatment of Palestinians, and who was frequently accused of anti-Semitism, yet he was careful to distinguish between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism. <ref>

:"In an interview in Witness in 2003, Father Prior said: “The God they portray looks to me to be a militaristic and xenophobic genocide who would not be even sufficiently moral to conform to the Fourth Geneva Convention. How, I constantly ask myself, are such people so unconcerned about others being kicked out of their homes, children being shot, people struggling for survival against very oppressive forces of occupation?” Needless to say, he was sometimes accused of being anti-Semitic. But he was careful to distinguish between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism. He believed that Muslims, Jews and Christians could and should live in equality and harmony. In his last article, published in The Tablet shortly before his death, he warned that the Catholic-Jewish liaison committee’s decision to equate antiZionism with anti-Semitism was a grave mistake. He was convinced that Zionism flew in the face of the Hebrew Scriptures."

:"Since my son was killed in Iraq and I have come to prominence in the peace movement, the name I am called with the second highest frequency (behind “anti-American”) is “anti-Semitic.’  First of all, isn’t it interesting if one is anti-violence and pro-peace, that automatically makes one anti-American and anti-Semitic? That just tells us that violence and oppression are so inherently institutionalized in our cultures, that if one is against these things, that makes one against the entire culture, race or way of life. It should be fundamentally understood that criticism of Israel’s program of Palestinian pogrom and the US’s demented foreign policy is not to be construed as hatred of all Jews or all Americans."

===Critics that suggest censorship or suppression=== . 

Political scientists [[John Mearsheimer]] and [[Stephen Walt]] wrote an article critical of the Israel lobby in the United States, in which they asserted that the Israel lobby uses accusations of anti-Semitism as a part of a deliberate strategy to suppress criticism of Israel.  Mearsheimer and Walt themselves were accused of anti-Semitism as a result of that article and [[The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy|the book they wrote]] based on the article. <ref>
*Harrison, pp 194-195:
:"… Mearsheimer and Walt were widely accused of anti-Semitism and responded forcefully that, in their opinion, such accusations were baseless and were being leveled purely in order to suppress legitimate criticism of Israel and its supporters…. [their] thesis includes as a subordinate contention the claim that the Israel lobby uses the accusation of anti-Semitism purely as a tool to suppress criticism of Israel.  All talk of a 'new anti-Semitism' is asserted to be part of a deliberate strategy:  'Israel's advocates, when pressed to go beyond mere assertion, claim that there is a new anti-Semitism which they equate with criticism of Israel.  In other words, criticise Israeli policy, and you are by definition an anti-semite'."

S. government, and as a result he has been called antisemitic.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}  In response, Nader wrote a letter to the director of the [[Anti-Defamation League]] entitled "Criticizing Israel is Not Anti-Semitism" in which he said "Your mode of operation for years has been to make charges of racism or insinuation of racism designed to slander and evade. Because your pattern of making such charges, carefully calibrated for the occasion but of the same stigmatizing intent, has served to deter critical freedom of speech....  The ADL should be working toward this objective [peace] and not trying to suppress realistic discourse on the subject with epithets and innuendos."<ref>[[Ralph Nader|Nader, Ralph]], "A Letter to Abraham Foxman: Criticizing Israel is Not Anti-Semitism", in ''Counterpunch'', 16 October 2004, [http://www.counterpunch.org/nader10162004.html  online]</ref> . 

[[William I. Robinson]], a professor at [[UCSB]], was accused of being antisemitic due to a class assignment that revolved around Israel's attack on the [[Gaza]] strip, and he replied by stating that the [[Israel lobby in the United States|Israel lobby]] labels "any criticism" of Israel as anti-Semitic<ref>[http://www.adl.org/PresRele/IslME_62/5556_62.htm ADL commentary on Robinson]</ref>  In response, Robinson said:  "The fact that I did include my interpretation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is totally within what is normal and expected.... One of the most pressing affairs of January was the Israeli assault on [[Gaza]] - there was nothing that could be more relevant to this course at that time.   When you bring up delicate, sensitive, inflammatory, controversial material in the classroom, we as professors are carrying out our mission to jar students in order to challenge them to think critically about world issues.... The Israel lobby is possibly the most powerful lobby in the United States, and what they do is label any criticism of anti-Israeli conduct and practices as anti-Semitic" Robinson said. "This campaign is not just an attempt to punish me. The [[Israel lobby in the United States|Israel lobby]] is stepping up its vicious attacks on anyone who would speak out against Israeli policies." <ref>Rosenfeld, Elliot, "Investigation of Professor Forges Ahead", ''Daily Nexus'', [http://www.dailynexus.com/2009-06-04/investigation-of-professor-forges-ahead/ online]</ref> . 

==Responses to criticism==. 
===Israeli public opinion===. 
International criticism is  an important focus within Israel. According to an August 2010 survey by Tel Aviv University, more than half of Israelis believe "the whole world is against us", and three quarters of Israelis believe "that no matter what Israel does or how far it goes towards resolving the conflict with the Palestinians, the world will continue to criticize Israel". <ref name="peace index">{{cite web|title=Tel Aviv University, Israel Democracy Institute, Peace Index August 2010|url=http://peaceindex.org/indexMonthEng.aspx?num=56|accessdate=2010-12-07}}</ref> As a result, [[Public diplomacy (Israel)|public diplomacy]], known as [[hasbara]], has been an important focus of Israeli governments since Independence. The Israeli [[Information and Diaspora Minister of Israel|Ministry of Public Diplomacy & Diaspora Affairs]] seeks to explain government policies and promote Israel in the face of what they consider negative press about Israel around the world – the current campaign is called Masbirim. <ref name="masbirim">{{cite web|title=Masbirim|url=http://masbirim.gov.il/eng/|accessdate=2010-12-07}}</ref> . 

===Claims of media bias===. 
{{see also|Media coverage of the Arab–Israeli conflict}}
In an article for Muslim World Today, the Pakistani-American author, [[Tashbih Sayyed]], said that the "bad press" "chooses to ignore all rules of ethical journalism when it comes to Israel". <ref name=Israel>{{cite web|last=Tashbih|first=Sayyed|title=A Muslim in a Jewish Land|url=http://www.muslimworldtoday.com/land30.htm|publisher=Muslim World Today |accessdate=17 June 2010}}</ref> [[Mudar Zahran]], a Jordanian of Palestinian heritage, writes that the "tendency to blame Israel for everything" has provided Arab leaders an excuse to deliberately ignore the human rights of the Palestinian in their countries. As an example, he said that while the world is furious over the blockade on Gaza, the media choose to deliberately ignore the conditions of the Palestinians living in refugee camps in Lebanon and other Arab countries. <ref>[http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=183252 Demonizing Israel is bad for the Palestinians], by Mudar Zarhan, 01/08/2010, Jerusalem Post</ref> . 

[[George Will]] claims that the "blame Israel first (and last, and in between) brigade" is "large and growing". <ref>The leveling wind: politics, the culture, and other news, 1990-1994. George Will. Viking, 1994. p. 336</ref> . 

===European governmental reports===. 
====European Union 2006 report on antisemitism ==== . 

The  [[European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia]] (EUMC, recently renamed to [[Fundamental Rights Agency]]) published a draft of an [[operational definition]] of [[antisemitism]]  called ''[[EUMC Working Definition of Antisemitism|Working Definition of Antisemitism]]''<ref name="Working Definition of Antisemitism">{{cite web
 |title=Working Definition of Antisemitism
 |url=http://fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/material/pub/AS/AS-WorkingDefinition-draft.pdf
 |publisher=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights
 |accessdate=24 July 2010
 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5mYZH56QA
 |archivedate=5 January 2010
}}</ref> which accompanied a report by the EUMC on report that summarized antisemitism in Europe. <ref>EUMC report</ref>  The EUMC working definition included five kinds of behaviors related to criticism of Israel that might be manifestations of antisemitism:<ref name="Working Definition of Antisemitism"/>
# Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor. 
# Applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation. 
# Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis. 
# Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis. 
# Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.  . 

This part of the definition has proved highly contentious and is seen by many as attempting to proscribe legitimate criticism of the human rights record of the Israeli Government by attempting to bring any criticism of Israel into the category of antisemitism, and as not sufficiently distinguishing between criticism of Israeli actions and criticism of Zionism as a political ideology, on the one hand, and racially based violence towards, discrimination against, or abuse of, Jews. <ref>

Paul Igansky points out that one of the EUMC anti-Semitic behaviors, comparisons between Israeli policy and those of the Nazis, is "arguably not intrinsically antisemitic", and that the context in which they are made is critical. Igansky illustrates this with the incident where Israeli prime minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] was described by fellow Jewish Israelis as cooperating with the Nazis, and depicted wearing an [[SS]] uniform. According to Igansky, the "Nazi" label was merely used as "charged political rhetoric" in this case. <ref name="Perry2009">Igansky, Paul, "Conceptualizing Anti-Jewish Hate Crime", in ''Hate Crimes'', [[Barbara A. Perry]] (Ed.),  Greenwood Publishing Group, 2009, pp 114-115</ref> . 

====EISCA 2009 report on criticism of Israel==== . 

Following the 2006 EUMC  report, the [[European Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism]] (EISCA) published a report in 2009 entitled ''Understanding and Addressing the ‘Nazi Card' - Intervening Against Antisemitic Discourse'' which discussed comparisons of Israel with Nazi Germany. <ref>Ignasky, EISCA Report.  A brief excerpt from the report's introduction, p. 4:
:"Playing the ‘Nazi card’ is a discursive act involving the use of Nazi or related terms or symbols (Nazism, Hitler, swastikas, etc.) in reference to Jews, Israel, Zionism or aspects of the Jewish experience. It manifests in words uttered in speech or in writing, or in visual representations such as artwork, drawings, caricatures, cartoons, graffiti, daubings and scratchings, or visual expressions such as a Nazi salute or the clicking of heels.  In many instances, the playing of the Nazi card is unquestionably antisemitic. However, the inclusion of particular modes of criticism of Israel in definitions of antisemitism has provoked controversy. The result has been a war of words which has stagnated into an intellectual and discursive cul-de-sac of claim and counter-claim about what does and does not qualify as antisemitism….  One of the most challenging components of antisemitic discourse in general, and the discursive theme of the Nazi card in particular, concerns the problem of when the Nazi card is played against Israel and its founding movement, Zionism. In this case playing the Nazi card involves equating the Israeli state collectively, or the state embodied by its leaders or its military practices, with Nazis, Nazi Germany, and the genocidal actions of the Nazi regime…."</ref> . 

The 2009 report incorporated from the 2006 report the five specific kinds of criticism of Israel that should be considered as anti-Semitism (see above for list of the five). <ref>EISCA report, p 34</ref> . 

The report does not say all criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic:  "Abhorrence and protest against the policies, practices, and leaders of the Israeli state can be expressed in numerous forceful and trenchant ways, as they could against any other state - none of which would be antisemitic…",<ref>EISCA report, p 24</ref> and "Drawing attention to the consequent harms in [playing the Nazi card against Israel] should not be intended, or taken, in any way as an attempt to suppress criticism of Israel and its military practices."<ref>EISCA report, p 32</ref> . 

[[Antony Lerman]] criticized the report, and suggested that it could be used to suppress legitimate criticism of Israel, and suggests that the report's authors do not adequately address that possibility. <ref>Lerman ''Should we ban ..":
:"While much of the [report's] definition [of anti-Semitism relating to criticism of Israel] is unexceptionable, it cites five ways in which antisemitism could be seen to "manifest itself with regard to the state of Israel taking into account the overall context".  One of these – "using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism... to characterize Israel or Israelis" – is fully justified. The other four are contentious: "Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination";  "Applying double standards by requiring of [Israel] a behaviour not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation";  "Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis"; "Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel".  None of these four are self-evidently antisemitic. But all could be used to justify labeling legitimate criticism of Israel as antisemitic. So the authors' approval of them makes their claim that "Drawing attention to the consequent harms in [playing the Nazi card against Israel] should not be intended, or taken, in any way as an attempt to suppress criticism of Israel and its military practices" both naïve and flimsy."
</ref> . 

===Criminalization of criticism of Israel=== . 

The EISCA Report recommends that the British government criminalize certain kinds of anti-Semitism, particularly use of the Nazi analogy to criticize Israel, as well as other forms of criticism of Israel. <ref>Igansky, EISCA Report, pp 28-30</ref> . 

[[Paul Craig Roberts]] and [[Antony Lerman]] have questioned the recommendations of the EISCA report, expressing concerns that the   recommendations of the report may be adopted as a hate-crime law within Europe, which may lead to infringement of free speech, and may criminalize legitimate criticism of Israel.  . 

Author [[Paul Craig Roberts]] is opposed to legislation in the United States will make it a crime to criticize Israel, and as examples he cites the [[Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004]] and the [[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act|Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009]].  Roberts asserts that lobbyists for Israel are pressing for laws that will make it a crime to discuss the power of the Israel lobby, or to discuss alleged war crimes of Israel. <ref>Roberts, Paul Craig, "The End of Free Speech? Criminalizing Criticism of Israel", ''Counterpunch'' 7 May 2009,  [http://www.counterpunch.org/roberts05072009.html online]:
:"On October 16, 2004, President George W. Bush signed the Israel Lobby’s bill, the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act.  This legislation requires the US Department of State to monitor anti-semitism world wide. To monitor anti-semitism, it has to be defined.  What is the definition?  Basically, as defined by the Israel Lobby and Abe Foxman, it boils down to any criticism of Israel or Jews. Rahm Israel Emanuel hasn’t been mopping floors at the White House.  As soon as he gets the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 passed, it will become a crime for any American to tell the truth about Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and theft of their lands.   It will be a crime for Christians to acknowledge the New Testament’s account of Jews demanding the crucifixion of Jesus. It will be a crime to report the extraordinary influence of the Israel Lobby on the White House and Congress, such as the AIPAC-written resolutions praising Israel for its war crimes against the Palestinians in Gaza that were endorsed by 100 per cent  of the US Senate and 99 per cent  of the House of Representatives, while the rest of the world condemned Israel for its barbarity.  It will be a crime to doubt the Holocaust.   It will become a crime to note the disproportionate representation of Jews in the media, finance, and foreign policy.  In other words, it means the end of free speech, free inquiry, and the First Amendment to the Constitution. Any facts or truths that cast aspersion upon Israel will simply be banned…. Criminalizing criticism of Israel destroys any hope of America having an independent foreign policy in the Middle East that serves American rather than Israeli interests.  It eliminates  any prospect of Americans escaping from their enculturation with Israeli propaganda.  To keep American minds captive, the Lobby is working to ban as anti-semitic any truth or disagreeable fact that pertains to Israel.  It is permissible to criticize every other country in the world, but it is anti-semitic to criticize Israel, and anti-semitism will soon be a universal hate-crime in the Western world.  Most of Europe has already criminalized doubting the Holocaust.  It is a crime even to confirm that it happened but to conclude that less than 6 million Jews were murdered.  "
</ref> . 

[[Antony Lerman]] criticized the 2009 EISCA report, and claims that criminalizing criticism of Israel (particularly, comparing Israel actions to Nazi actions) would constitute an excessive infringement of freedom of speech in Britain, postulating, for example, that "if you said 'the way the IDF operated in Gaza was like the way the SS acted in Poland', and a Jew found this offensive, hurtful or harmful, you could, in theory, go to jail."<ref>Lerman, "Should We Ban..":
:"Using Nazi analogies to criticise Israel and Zionism is offensive, but should it be banned, criminalized or branded as antisemitic?  …   The authors of a new report, Understanding and Addressing the "Nazi Card": Intervening Against Antisemitic Discourse, from the European Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism (EISCA), take a different line....   While the principle that freedom of speech is not absolute is accepted in English law, not all offensive speech is criminalized. So, merely showing that comparing Israeli behaviour to the Nazis is offensive is no reason to outlaw such discourse. The authors try to get round this by arguing that such comparisons are especially offensive to Jews, because of their history. They say: "Most people would accept that it's completely unacceptable to call a Jewish person a Nazi." The implication here – that it may, therefore, be acceptable in some circumstances to call a non-Jew a Nazi – is unfortunate to say the least. If one is against the use of Nazi comparisons in public debate, it's unacceptable to call anyone a Nazi. In which case, the argument of exceptional offensiveness for Jews doesn't hold.... The authors write: 'although the playing of the Nazi card is not always antisemitic, it unquestionably always harms'. As a result, where this occurs, it could already be defined as a criminal act, and if not, Iganski and Sweiry say, consideration should be given to changing the law so that it would be. In other words, if you said 'the way the IDF operated in Gaza was like the way the SS acted in Poland', and a Jew found this offensive, hurtful or harmful, you could, in theory, go to jail."

===Boycotts and divestment from Israel===. 
{{See|Boycotts of Israel|Academic boycotts of Israel|Disinvestment from Israel|Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions}} . 

Boycotts of Israel are [[economy|economic]] and [[politics|political]] cultural campaigns or actions that seek a selective or total cutting of ties with the [[Israel|State of Israel]]. Such campaigns are employed by those who challenge the legitimacy of Israel, Israel's policies or actions towards the [[Palestinians]] over the course of the [[Arab-Israeli conflict|Arab-Israeli]] and [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], oppose Israeli territorial claims in the [[West Bank]] or [[Jerusalem]] or even oppose Israel's right to exist. Arab [[boycott]]s of [[Zionist]] institutions and [[Jew]]ish businesses began before Israel's founding as a state. An official boycott was adopted by the [[Arab League]] almost immediately after the formation of the state of Israel in 1948, but is not fully implemented in practice.  . 

Similar boycotts have been proposed outside the [[Arab world]] and the [[Muslim world]]. These boycotts comprise economic measures such as [[divest]]ment; a consumer boycotts of Israeli products or businesses that operate in Israel; a proposed [[Academic boycotts of Israel|academic boycott]] of [[List of universities in Israel|Israeli universities]] and scholars; and a proposed boycott of [[Culture of Israel|Israeli cultural institutions]] or [[Sport in Israel|Israeli sport venues]]. Many advocates of the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions|Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign]], including Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] use the 1980s [[anti-apartheid movement|movement against South African apartheid]] as a model. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bds-palestine.net/ |publisher=Palestine BDS Campaign | title=Palestinian Civil Society Calls for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions against Israel Until it Complies with International Law and Universal Principles of Human Rights |date=9 July 2005}}</ref> . 

Disinvestment from Israel is a campaign conducted by religious and political entities which aims to use [[disinvestment]] to pressure the [[government of Israel]] to put "an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories captured during the 1967 military campaign."<ref name=autogenerated1/>  The disinvestment campaign is related to other [[economic and political boycotts of Israel]]. A notable campaign was initiated in 2002 and endorsed by [[South Africa]]'s [[Desmond Tutu]]. <ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Israel/Israel_Time_To_Divest.html Israel: Time to Divest].
