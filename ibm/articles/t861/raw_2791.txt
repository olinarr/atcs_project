Import of goods into the Gaza Strip is limited as part of the [[2007–present blockade of the Gaza Strip]] imposed by [[Israel]] and [[Egypt]]. Israel allows limited [[humanitarian aid|humanitarian supplies]] from aid organizations into the Gaza Strip. [[Humanitarian aid|Humanitarian organizations]], including UN agencies, bring goods into Gaza. As of May 2010, they have brought in, according to the [[Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories]] of the [[Israel Defense Forces]], 1.5 million liters of diesel fuel and gasoline, fruits and vegetables, wheat, sugar, meat, chicken and fish products, dairy products, animal feed, hygiene products, clothing and shoes. <ref name="IDF Spokesperson's Unit">{{Cite web|url=http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/News/today/10/05/0503.htm |title=Summary of the weekly transfer of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip by the IDF Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (CoGAT) |date=2010-05-05 |publisher=[[IDF Spokesperson's Unit]]}}</ref> .

==Background==. 
After the Islamist Hamas movement seized power in Gaza, Israel and Egypt tightened their closure of Gaza's borders. <ref name=BBC/> Israel says the purpose of the restrictions in import of goods into Gaza are to pressure Hamas, which does not recognise Israel and backs attacks on its citizens. <ref name=BBC/> Construction materials including metal pipes,<ref name="google.com">{{Cite web|last=Rabinowitz |first=Gavin |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hYVYAfX_Mu7L_Kv-VU_3g4XdDiSA |title=AFP: Israel to allow more 'civilian' goods into Gaza: official |publisher=Google.com |date=2010-06-20 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> steel<ref name="foxnews.com">{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/06/09/israel-allows-banned-products-gaza/ |title=Israel Allows Some Once-Banned Products Into Gaza |publisher=FOXNews.com |date=2010-04-07 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> and cement are banned, since Israel fears could be used for building rockets and constructing underground bunkers and tunnels. <ref name="google.com"/> . 

In September 2007, citing an intensification of [[Qassam rocket]] attacks, [[Israel]] declared [[Gaza]] "hostile territory." The declaration allowed [[Israel]] to prevent the transfer of electricity, fuel, and other supplies into [[Gaza]]. The stated purpose of the blockade was to pressure [[Hamas]] into ending the rocket attacks and to deprive them of the supplies necessary for the continuation of rocket attacks. <ref>{{cite news|title=Israel Pressures Hamas Ahead of Rice’s Arrival|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/20/world/middleeast/20mideast.html?scp=3&sq=Gaza+fuel+Qassam&st=nyt|publisher=New York Times|date=September 19, 2007 | first1=Steven | last1=Erlanger | first2=Helene | last2=Cooper | accessdate=2010-05-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Israel declares Gaza 'hostile territory'|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/09/19/africa/mideast.php|publisher=[[International Herald Tribune|IHT]]|date=September 19, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Cabinet declares Gaza 'hostile territory'|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/905561.html|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|date=September 20, 2007}}</ref><ref name="MFA Gaza">[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Templates/ArticleDynamicFix.aspx?NRMODE=Published&NRORIGINALURL=%2fMFA%2fGovernment%2fCommuniques%2f2007%2fSecurity%2bCabinet%2bdeclares%2bGaza%2bhostile%2bterritory%2b19-Sep-2007%2ehtm&NRNODEGUID=%7bC93011D3-18EA-4EEB-84C1-717072E4071A%7d&NRCACHEHINT=Guest Security Cabinet declares Gaza hostile territory] by [[Israel Foreign Affairs Ministry|MFA]]</ref> It argued that following the takeover of Gaza by Hamas and the intensification of [[Qassam rocket]] attacks, it is not legally responsible for [[Gaza]] and not obliged to help a hostile territory beyond whatever is necessary to avoid a humanitarian crisis. <ref name=sanctions_legal>{{cite news|title=Gaza sanctions: The legal argument |publisher=BBC|agency=Associated Press|date=2007-10-30 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7069203.stm|first=Paul|last=Reynolds}}</ref> Egypt also closed the Rafah Border Crossing in June 2007,<ref name=Almeghari>{{cite news | url = http://www.imemc.org/article/52479 | title = Haniya's former advisor expects reopening of other Gaza crossings | first = Rami | last =Almeghari | work = International Middle East Media Center | date = 2008-01-27 }}</ref> maintaining that it cannot fully open the [[Rafah crossing]] since completely opening the border would represent Egyptian recognition of the Hamas control of Gaza, undermine the legitimacy of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] and consecrate the split between Gaza and the West Bank. <ref name="egypt">{{cite news|title=The Associated Press|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/egypt-fm-hamas-gave-israel-the-excuse-to-launch-gaza-attacks-1.267251|newspaper=The Associated Press}}</ref> . 

==Import through Egypt==. 
In addition to the border crossings from Israel, the [[Rafah crossing]] from Egypt to Gaza has been closed for the pass of commercial goods since 2007, and Egypt maintained that it would only open the crossing if forces from the Palestinian Authority presidential guard and a European supervisory force guarded the border crossing. <ref name=egypttoday/> On June 1, 2010 the border was partially opened, and the Egyptian Red Crescent sent 30 tons of medicine across the border on June 14. Egypt’s foreign ministry has made it clear that the crossing will remain open mainly for people, not for aid, to go through. <ref name=egypttoday/> The Arab Physicians Union officials submitted a request to Egyptian authorities on June 3, 2010 to send 400 tons of food, blankets, electric generators for hospitals and construction material from Egypt to Gaza, but their request was denied by Egyptian authorities without specific reason. Emad Gad, political analyst at Egyptian Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, believes the government should keep the Rafah border under control because opening it completely could allow weapons smuggling or illegal financial transactions. <ref name=egypttoday>[http://www.egypttoday.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=9067 A Crack in the Blockade , Egypt Today,  July 2010]</ref> . 

Egypt does not limit the supply of gas and fuel, though since Egyptian fuel is heavier than Israeli fuel, it damages the newer cars in Gaza and causes malfunctions. <ref name=haaretz>http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/amira-hass-israel-bans-books-music-and-clothes-from-entering-gaza-1.276147</ref> . 

==Import through Israel==. 
===List of items===. 
Israel's blockade was initially more restrictive and has generally been weakened over time. 
====Pre-June 2010====. 
According to [[Amnesty International]], the Economist, Haaretz and UN reports, prior to June 2010, the following was banned or restricted: . 

'''Food'''. According to a UN report, importation of lentils, pasta, tomato paste and juice has been restricted. <ref name=UN1/> Pasta has since been allowed. Sugar has always been allowed. <ref name=haaretz/> Soda, juice, jam, spices, shaving cream, potato chips, cookies and candy are now permitted. <ref name=Hass>http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/gazans-get-halva-but-not-cookies-1.295228</ref> Fruit, milk products in small packages and frozen food products are also allowed. <ref name=haaretz/> Dry food,<ref name=UN2/> ginger and chocolate were at one point barred. <ref name="economist.com">{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16264970 |title=Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip: Trade off |publisher=The Economist |date=2010-06-01 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> . 

'''Household items'''. A4 paper,<ref name="economist.com"/> crayons, stationary, soccer balls, and musical instruments have been, at times, banned for import. <ref name=UN2>{{cite news |title=Gaza strip |url=http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_the_humanitarian_monitor_2010_04_english.pdf |work=The Humanitarian Monitor |date=April 2010 |page=8 |publisher=[[UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] – occupied Palestinian territory |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}</ref> According to AFP other banned goods include toilet paper,<ref name="google.com">{{Cite web|last=Rabinowitz |first=Gavin |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hYVYAfX_Mu7L_Kv-VU_3g4XdDiSA |title=AFP: Israel to allow more 'civilian' goods into Gaza: official |publisher=Google.com |date=2010-06-20 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> though the BBC lists it as permitted. <ref name=BBC/> According to the [[Haaretz]] the following items were banned in 2009: books, candles, crayons, clothing, cups, cutlery, crockery, electric appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines, glasses, light bulbs, matches, musical instruments, needles, sheets, blankets, shoes, mattresses, spare machine and car parts, and threads. <ref name=haaretz>http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/amira-hass-israel-bans-books-music-and-clothes-from-entering-gaza-1.276147</ref>   . 

'''Reconstruction materials'''. [[Amnesty International]] and other organisations report that cement, glass, steel, bitumen, wood, paint, doors, plastic pipes, metal pipes, metal reinforcement rods, aggregate, generators, high voltage cables and wooden telegraph poles are high priority reconstruction materials currently with no or highly limited entry into Gaza through official crossings. <ref>http://www.carewbg.org/Failing-Gaza.pdf</ref> A UN report by Kevin M. Cahill said reconstruction was halted because of lack of steel, cement or glass, among other building materials. <ref name=UN1>http://www.un.org/ga/president/63/news/GazaReport.pdf</ref>  . 

'''Fuel'''. Fuel had not been imported from Israel since 2008. While fuel is available from Egypt, in contrast to Israeli fuel, it damages the newer cars in Gaza and causes malfunctions. Israel allowed only limited amounts of industrial fuel into Gaza prior to June 2010. <ref name=haaretz/> . 

'''Agriculture and fishing'''. According to Gisha, fishing ropes and rods, ginger and chocolate, hatcheries and spare parts for hatcheries, were at one point barred. <ref name="economist.com"/> . 

'''Medical material'''. Batteries for hearing aids have been restricted. <ref name=UN1/> Wheelchairs, at various times, have been banned. <ref name=UN2/> . 

According to the Haaretz, the number of items allowed into Gaza, as of May 2010, is about 100. Before the blockade, some 4,000 items were allowed. Gisha states that a large Israeli supermarket holds 10,000-15,000 items. <ref name=Hass>http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/gazans-get-halva-but-not-cookies-1.295228</ref> . 

====Post-June 2010====. 
On June 17, 2010, the Israel cabinet agreed to ease the restrictions on items permitted into the Gaza strip.  .

* Specific procedures, on a case by case basis, will be established so as to permit the transfer of such lumber for other purposes in Gaza.  . 

===Information about the blockade===. 
A list of items which Israel allowed for commercial import has been compiled by the [[BBC]]<ref name=BBC>Franks, Tim. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8654337.stm Details of Gaza blockade revealed in court case] and [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/05_05_10_gazaimports.pdf Full List (pdf)], ''[[BBC News]]''</ref> from information from international groups including Israeli Human Rights Organisation Gisha. Humanitarian organisations, including UN agencies, which also bring goods into Gaza have their items approved or rejected on "a case-by-case basis". The items allowed are always changing, and commercial and humanitarian importers, according to BBC, "are constantly attempting to guess what will be approved."<ref name=BBC/> . 

Gisha have said that their list is approximate, partial and it changes from time to time because Israeli authorities refuse to disclose information regarding the restrictions on transferring goods into Gaza. Gisha acquires information from Palestinian traders, international organizations, and the Palestinian Coordination Committee, "all of whom "deduce" what is permitted and what is banned based on their experience requesting permission to bring goods into Gaza and the answers they receive from the Israeli authorities". <ref name=gisha1>[http://www.gisha.org/UserFiles/File/publications/Products060610_Eng%281%29.pdf gisha.org]</ref>  . 

In January 2010, the Israeli human rights group Gisha took Israeli authorities to court, it attempt to force them to reveal which goods were permitted and which goods weren't. Israeli State denied it has "a list of permitted goods" for months. However, "in its updated response to a petition <ref>http://gisha.org/index.php?intLanguage=2&intItemId=1764&intSiteSN=113&OldMenu=113</ref> submitted by Gisha under the [[Freedom of Information]] Act, the State recently admitted that it does have a list of permitted goods and other documents relating to the transfer of goods to Gaza,<ref>http://www.gisha.org/UserFiles/File/HiddenMessages/StateResponseEng250410.pdf</ref> but claimed that revealing them would harm state security and/or Israel's foreign relations. A [[hearing]] to determine whether the documents should be revealed will be held in October 2010." <ref>http://www.gisha.org/index.php?intLanguage=2&intSiteSN=119&intItemId=1798</ref> Gisha reported that since Israel tightened the blockade on Gaza an average of 2,300 trucks entered the strip every month, about a quarter of the number of trucks before 2007.  . 

===Rationale===. 
Israel says that the importation curbs are in place to pressure Hamas. <ref name=BBC/> . 

An Israeli government document obtained in response to the lawsuit describes Israel's blockade as "[[economic warfare]]": "A country has the right to decide that it chooses not to engage in economic relations or to give economic assistance to the other party to the conflict, or that it wishes to operate using 'economic warfare'. <ref name="Frenkel-econowar">{{cite news |author=Sheera Frenkel |title=Israeli document: Gaza blockade isn't about security |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/06/09/95621/israeli-document-gaza-blockade.html |publisher=[[McClatchy Newspapers]] |date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 10, 2010}}</ref> "An Israeli government spokesman in June 2010 added that the blockade is intended to bring about a political goal and that Israel "could not lift the embargo altogether as long as Hamas remains in control" of Gaza. <ref name="Frenkel-econowar" /> . 

In the past Israel expressed concerns about Hamas using building materials for military means. <ref name=BBC/> . 

==Reactions==. 
In February 2009, Senator John Kerry visited Gaza and expressed his "astonishment" at the ban of items. Importation of pasta was allowed after that. <ref name=haaretz/> .
