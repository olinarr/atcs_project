'''International aid''' has played a major role in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] as it has been used as a means to keep the peace process going. <ref>Keating (2005), 2</ref> '''Palestinians''' in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]] receive one of the highest levels of aid in the world. <ref>Palestine Human Development Report (2004), 113. According to certain analyses, [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]] are the largest per capita recipients of [[international development assistance]] in the world (Lasensky [2004], 211, [http://www.usip.org/publications/dollars-and-diplomacy-foreign-aid-and-palestinian-question Lasensky-Grace [2006&#93;]). Hever (2005), [http://www.alternativenews.org/downloads/task,doc_download/gid,19/ 13, 16], and (2006), 5, 10 refutes this assessment, arguing that Israel is the biggest recipient of total [[foreign aid]] in the world. Turner (2006), 747, underscores that the US provides Israel with annual bilateral funds of US$654 per person, which is more than double what the Palestinians receive in multilateral aid. According to Le More (2005), 982, "the United States has also provided [the PNA with] considerable funds, even if they are negligible compared to what it allocates bilaterally to Israel—which alone far exceeds the level of combined international assistance to the
Palestinians."</ref> Aid has been offered to the [[Palestinian National Authority]] (PNA) and other Palestinian [[Non-governmental organization]]s (PNGOs) by the [[international community]], including [[International nongovernmental organization|International Non-governmental Organizations]] (INGOs).  . 

The entities that provide aid to the Palestinians are categorized into seven groups: the [[Arab nations]], the [[European Union]], the [[United States]], [[Japan]], international institutions (including [[UN agencies|agencies]] of the [[United Nations System|UN system]]), European countries, and other nations. <ref>Palestine Human Development Report (2004), [http://www.undp.ps/en/newsroom/publications/pdf/other/phdr2004.pdf 116]</ref> . 

==History==. 
===Before Oslo===. 
Before the signing of the [[Oslo accords]], two entities were the major sources of international aid for the [[Israeli-occupied territories]] of West Bank and Gaza: the donors of the [[Western world|West]] and the Arab states. Most of these programs started or developed during the 1970s, and they were further expanded during the 1980s. Because of the lack of a Palestinian state entity-partner, the majority of the sums were channeled through PNGOs or INGOs. <ref>Since 1970 the role of the INGOs (and in particular of the Northern NGOs) in the delivery of aid was strengthened (Hanafi-Tabar [2005], 35–36). </ref> Although the stance of the donors during the pre-Oslo period is regarded by some analysts, such as Rex Brynen, as controversial and linked with phenomena, such as corruption, nationalism and factional rivalries,<ref name="Br47-48">For instance, [[Jordan]]'s disengagement from its administrative role in the West Bank just after 1990, and the discontent of some Arab states-donors for the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]]'s stance during the [[First Gulf War]] resulted in the Organization's almost complete breakdown (Brynen [2000], 47–48). </ref> international aid effectively financed  a series of programs in the sectors of agriculture, infrastructure, housing and education. <ref>Brynen (2000), 44–48</ref> . 

===Oslo===. 
{{see also|Oslo accords}}
[[Image:Shimon Peres by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Even before the signing of the Oslo accords, [[Shimon Peres]] had called for an international donors' conference, recognizing that a major US aid program for the Palestinians would have difficulties given the past U.S.-PLO relationship. <ref name="l92">Peres had stated: "So I came up with the idea for an international donors' conference. The aid itself didn't radically change how the Palestinians negotiated, but we both knew it would be
crucial to the implementation of the agreement (Lasensky [2002], [http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2002/issue1/lasensky.pdf 92])."</ref>]]
The Oslo accords, officially signed<ref>Before the signing ceremony, President [[Bill Clinton]] and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Warren Christopher]] spoke in very clear terms about America's commitment to provide
economic support to the Palestinians. Israeli foreign minister Shimon Peres told Palestinian officials that he had already secured commitments from European countries to give them aid (Lasensky [2002], [http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2002/issue1/lasensky.pdf 93] and [2004], 219). </ref> on September 13, 1993, on the [[White House]] lawn, contained substantial provisions on economic matters and international aid: Annex IV of the Declaration of Principles (DoP) discusses regional cooperation and implicitly calls for major international aid efforts to help the Palestinians, Jordan, Israel and the entire region. <ref>Annex IV (paragraph 1) of the [http://www.multied.com/Israel/Documents/Oslo.html Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements]: "The two sides will cooperate in the context of the multilateral peace efforts in promoting a Development Program for the region, including the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, to be initiated by the G7. The parties will request the G7 to seek the participation in this program of other interested states, such as members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, regional Arab states and institutions, as well as members of the private sector."</ref> . 

On October 1, 1993, the international donor community (nations and institutions<ref>22 donor states, major international
financial institutions, and states neighboring the
West Bank and Gaza (Frisch-Hoffnung [1997], 1243). </ref>) met in Washington to mobilize support for the peace process, and pledged to provide approximately $2.4 billion to the Palestinians over the course of the next five years. <ref>Aid Effectiveness (1999), 11; An Evaluation of Bank Assistance (2002), [http://lnweb18.worldbank.org/oed/oeddoclib.nsf/DocUNIDViewForJavaSearch/DB1BC6952F401E0785256B8A0067B726/$file/west_bank_and_gaza.pdf  2]; Palestine Human Development Report (2004), [http://www.undp.ps/en/newsroom/publications/pdf/other/phdr2004.pdf 115]</ref> The international community's action was
based on the premise that it was imperative to garner all financial resources needed to make the agreement successful, and with a full understanding that in order for the Accords to stand in the face of daily challenges on the ground, ordinary Palestinians needed to perceive positive change in their lives. <ref name="P113">Palestine Human Development Report (2004), [http://www.undp.ps/en/newsroom/publications/pdf/other/phdr2004.pdf 113]</ref> Therefore, the donors had two major goals: to fuel Palestinian economic growth and to build public
support for negotiations with Israel. <ref name="LasG">[http://www.usip.org/pubs/usipeace_briefings/2006/0810_aid_palestine.html Lasensky-Grace (2006)]. According to Yezid Sayigh (2007), 9, "starting with the first international donor conference in October 1993, foreign aidwas intended to demonstrate tangible peace dividends to the Palestinians as well as provide economic reconstruction and development to build public support
for continued diplomacy. </ref> According to Scott Lasensky, "throughout the follow-up talks to the
DoP that produced the Gaza-Jericho Agreement (May 1994), the Early Empowerment Agreement (August 1994), the [[Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip|Interim Agreement]] (September 1995), and the [[Protocol Concerning the Redeployment in Hebron|Hebron Accord]] (January 1997), [...]
economic aid hovered over the process and remained the single most critical external component buttressing the PNA."<ref>Lasensky (2002), [http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2002/issue1/lasensky.pdf 94] and (2004), 221</ref> . 

===1993–2000===. 
Between 1993 and 1997 the PNA faced serious economic and financial problems. <ref>Poor economic performance in these years was the product of many factors, such as the low public investment and the contraction of the regional economy, and they were aggravated by the effects of Israeli closures, permits policies, and other complex restrictions on the movement of people and goods (Aid Effectiveness [1999], [http://lnweb18.worldbank.org/mna/mena.nsf/Attachments/Aid+Effectivness+chp.+2/$File/chapter2-final.pdf 15]; Brynen [2000], 64; Le More [2005], 984). </ref> International aid prevented the collapse of the local economy, and contributed to the establishment of the Palestinian administration. <ref>An Evaluation of Bank Assistance (2002), [http://lnweb18.worldbank.org/oed/oeddoclib.nsf/DocUNIDViewForJavaSearch/DB1BC6952F401E0785256B8A0067B726/$file/west_bank_and_gaza.pdf  24]; Rocard (1999), 28; Roy (1995), 74–75</ref> Donors' pledges continued to increase regularly (their value had risen to approximately $3,420 million as of the end of October 1997) as a result of the faltering peace process, along with the increase in needs and the consequent increase in the assistance necessary for Palestinians to survive. <ref>Palestine Human Development Report (2004), [http://www.undp.ps/en/newsroom/publications/pdf/other/phdr2004.pdf 115]</ref> Reality led, however, to a revision of the donors' priorities:<ref>As [[USAID]] director Chris Crowley stated, "the political situation often drove the aid disbursement process (Lasensky [2002], [http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2002/issue1/lasensky.pdf 96–97])."</ref> Out of concern that the deteriorating economic conditions could result in a derailment of the peace process, donor support was redirected to finance continued budgetary shortfalls, housing programs and emergency employment creation. <ref>An Evaluation of Bank Assistance (2002), [http://lnweb18.worldbank.org/oed/oeddoclib.nsf/DocUNIDViewForJavaSearch/DB1BC6952F401E0785256B8A0067B726/$file/west_bank_and_gaza.pdf  25]; Brynen-Awartani-Woodcraft (2000), 254</ref> According to a more critical approach, international aid in the mid 1990s supported PNA's bureaucracy<ref name="Br228">According to Brynen (2005), 228, "closure [...] exacerbated the tendency of the PNA to use public sector employment as a tool of both political patronage and local job creation. The public sector payroll thus continued to expand at a rapid rate, growing from 9% of GDP in 1995 to 14% by 1997 [...] This sapped public funds needed for investment purposes and threatened to outstrip fiscal revenues."</ref> and belatedly promoted the centralization of political power, but in a way that did not enhance government capacity and harmed the PNGOs. <ref name="FH1247-1250">Frisch-Hoffnung (1997), 1247–1250</ref> In 1994–1995 problems of underfunding, inefficiency and poor aid coordination marked donors' activity, and led to tensions among the different aid bodies, and between the international community and the PNA. <ref>The Palestinians construed the shortage of aid funding as a form of punishment and as attempt of the donors to impose their own agenda, while US officials blamed "intra-PLO politics, the Palestinian leadership's resistance to donors' standards of accountability, and inexperienced [middle] management (Ball-Friedman-Rossiter [1997], 256; Brynen [2000], 114; Brynen-Awartani-Woodcraft [2000], 222; Lasensky [2004], 223; Roy [1995], 74–75)."</ref> In 1996, the link between development assistance and the success of the peace process was made explicit by the President of the [[World Bank]], [[James Wolfensohn]], who stated: "The sense of urgency is clear. Peace will only be assured in that area if you can get jobs for those people."<ref name="BFR257">Ball-Friedman-Rossiter (1997), 257</ref> . 

After 1997, there was a reduction in the use of closure policy by Israel, which led to an employment growth and an expansion of the West Bank and Gaza economy. <ref name="AE14">GDP grew by an estimated 3.8% in 1998 and 4.0% in 1999, and unemployment fell to 12.4 percent in 1999, almost half its 1996 peak (Aid Effectiveness [1999], 14). </ref> After the signing of the [[Wye River Memorandum]], a new donors' conference was convened, and over $2 billion was pledged to the PNA for 1999–2003. <ref>Lasensky (2002), [http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2002/issue1/lasensky.pdf 98]; Lasensky (2004), 225; Rocard(1998), 28</ref> Nevertheless, overall donor disbursements fell in 1998–2000, and the 1998 disbursements=to-commitments ratio was the lowest since 1994. <ref name="USCO1999">[http://www.arts.mcgill.ca/mepp/unsco/palecon99/014.htm Donor Disbursements and Public Investment], UNSCO</ref> As for international institutions, they began to play a bigger role in the international funding process, in spite of the decline in the absolute value of these institutions' total commitments. <ref>Palestine Human Development Report (2004), [http://www.undp.ps/en/newsroom/publications/pdf/other/phdr2004.pdf 117]</ref> After 1997, the need for donor support for the current budget and employment generation programs receded due to the PA's improved fiscal performance, and attention was focused instead on infrastructures to the detriment of institution building. <ref name="USCO1999" /> Donors' activity was also characterized by a decline in support for PNGOs, and by a preference to concessionary loans (instead of grants) with generous grace periods, long repayment periods and low interest rates<ref>Aid Effectiveness (1999), 18–20; Brynen (2000), 74; UNCTAD (2006), [http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/gdsapp20061_en.pdf 18]</ref> . 

===2000–2006===. 
The [[second Intifada]] led to one of the deepest recessions the Palestinian economy
experienced in modern history. <ref name="Dis1">Disengagement (2004), [http://lnweb18.worldbank.org/mna/mena.nsf/Attachments/Disengagement+Paper/$File/Disengagement+Paper.pdf 1]</ref> In those two years, Palestinian real
GDP per capita shrunk by almost 40 percent. <ref>Overview (2004), [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/WBG-Overview-e.pdf 6]</ref> The precipitator of this economic crisis was again a multi-faceted system of restrictions on the movement of goods and people designed to protect [[Israelis]] in Israel itself and in the settlements. <ref name="Dis1" /> . 

{{Timeline of Intifadas}} . 

One of the many frustrations of the crisis was the erosion of the development effort financed by the international community, since the overwhelming emphasis in donor work was now directed towards mitigating the impact of the economic and social crisis. A collapse of the PNA was averted by emergency budget support from donor countries. Despite a significant increase in donor commitments in 2002 compared with 2001, commitments to infrastructure and capacity-building work with a medium-term focus continued to decline. In 2000, the ratio was approximately 7:1 in
favor of development assistance. By 2002, the ratio had shifted to almost 5:1 in favor of
emergency assistance. <ref>Twenty-Seven Months (2003), [http://lnweb18.worldbank.org/mna/mena.nsf/Attachments/27+Months+of+Intifada,+Closures/$File/27+months+Intifada,+Closures...An+Assessment.pdf 51]</ref>

[[Yasser Arafat]]'s death in 2004 and [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|Israel's unilateral disengagement]] from Gaza created new hopes to the donor community.

On January&nbsp;25, 2006, [[Hamas]] won the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006|Palestinian legislative elections]]; the Islamist organization assumed power in March&nbsp;29, 2006, without accepting the terms and conditions set by the Quartet. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4665670.stm According to the Quartet], "all members of the future Palestinian government must be committed to non-violence, recognition of Israel and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations, including the roadmap."</ref> Hamas' stance resulted in a near cessation of direct relations between most bilateral donors and the PNA, with only some multilateral agencies and a few donors continuing direct contact and project administration. <ref>Sayigh (2007), 17; Two Years after London (2007), [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/AHLCMainReportfinalSept18&cover.pdf 30]</ref> Quartet's decision met the criticism of the Quartet's former envoy, James Wolfensohn, who characterized it "a misguided attempt to starve the Hamas-led Palestinians into submission," and of UN's Middle East former envoy, Alvaro de Soto. <ref>Eldar, [http://globalpolicy.org/security/issues/israel-palestine/2006/0503quartet.htm Quartet to Hold Key Talks]; McCarthy-Williams, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/jun/13/usa.israel Secret UN report condemns US]; McCarthy-Williams, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/jun/13/usa.israel1 UN Was Pummeled into Submission]</ref> Because of the worsening human crisis, the [[EU]] proposed a plan to channel aid directly to the Palestinians, bypassing the Hamas-led PNA; the Quartet approved the proposal, despite the initial US reaction, and the EU set up a "temporary international mechanism" (TIM) to channel the money for an initial three-month period, which was later extended. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4976368.stm US "Blocks" Palestinian Aid Plan], BBC News; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5091460.stm Powers agree Palestinian Aid Plan], BBC News; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4756407.stm Palestinians to Get Interim Aid], BBC News</ref> [[Oxfam]] was one of the main critics of the EU TIM program arguing that "limited direct payments from the European Commission have failed to address this growing crisis."<ref>Oxfam, [http://www.oxfam.org/en/news/pressreleases2006/pr060914_palestine EU Must Resume Aid]; Oxfam, [http://www.oxfam.org.uk/applications/blogs/pressoffice/2007/02/middle_east_quartet_should_end.html Middle East Quartet].

The emergence of two rival governments in the West Bank and Gaza in June 2006 presented the international community with the prospect of shouldering a huge aid burden. <ref>Sayigh (2007), 27</ref> The World Bank estimated that in 2008 PNA would need $1.2 billion in recurrent budget support, in addition to $300 million in development aid. <ref>Thus, external aid will be at least 32% of GDP (Palestinian Economic Prospects [2008], [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/AHLCSept15,08.pdf 7]). </ref> The formation of the caretaker government in mid-2007 under Fayyad, and the resumption of aid have partially reversed the impacts of the aid boycott. <ref>The Bush administration unfroze $86 million in August 2007; the first $10 million was intended to strengthen Mr. Abbas' security forces (Cooper-Erlanger, [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/03/world/middleeast/03diplo.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin Rice Backs Appointed Palestinian Premier]). </ref> Nevertheless, economic indicators have not changed considerably. For instance, because of the situation in Gaza, real GDP growth was estimated to be about -0,5% in 2007, and 0,8% in 2008. <ref name="WB6">Implementing the Palestinian Reform (2008), [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/WorldBankAHLCMay2,08.pdf 6]; Palestinian Economic Prospects (2008), [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/AHLCSept15,08.pdf 6–7]</ref> . 

===2007–2009===. 
In December 2007, during the [[Paris Donor Conference]], which followed the [[Annapolis Conference]], the international community pledged over $7.7 billion for 2008–2010 in support of the Palestinian Reform and Development Program (PRDP). <ref name="WB10">Implementing the Palestinian Reform (2008), [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/WorldBankAHLCMay2,08.pdf 10]</ref> Hamas, which was not invited to Paris, called the conference a "declaration of war" on it. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7147338.stm Palestinians "Win $7bn Aid Vow"], BBC News</ref> In the beginning of 2008, The EU moved from the TIM mechanism to PEGASE, which provides channels for direct support to the PNA's Central Treasury Account in addition to the types of channels used for TIM. The World Bank also launched a trust fund that would provide support in the context of the PNA's 2008–2010 reform policy agenda. <ref>Implementing the Palestinian Reform (2008), [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/WorldBankAHLCMay2,08.pdf 15]; [http://www.delwbg.ec.europa.eu/en/funding/pegas_documents.htm Overview of PEGASE], European Commission</ref> However, neither mechanism contains sufficient resources to cover the PNA's entire monthly needs, thus not allowing the PNA to plan expenditures beyond a two-month horizon. <ref>Palestinian Economic Prospects (2008), [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/AHLCSept15,08.pdf 35]</ref> . 

The World Bank assesses that the PNA has made significant progress on implementing the reform agenda laid out in the PRDP, and re-establishing law and order; Gaza, however, remains outside of the reforms as Hamas controls security and the most important ministry positions there. Palestinian inter-factional tension continues in the West Bank and Gaza, with arrests of people and closures of NGOs by each side, resulting in a deterioration in the ability of civil society organizations to continue cater to vulnerable groups. <ref>Palestinian Economic Prospects (2008), [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/AHLCSept15,08.pdf 5–6]</ref> Following the [[Gaza War|2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict]], an international conference took place in [[Sharm El-Sheikh]], [[Egypt]], where donors pledged almost $4.5 billion for the resonstruction of Gaza. These funds bypass Hamas, since the PNA, in collaboration with the donor community, has taken the leadership in delivering and distributing the [[2008–2009 Gaza Strip aid|assistance]]. <ref>Fund-Channeling Options (2009), 6; Pleming & Sharp, [http://www.iht.com/articles/reuters/2009/03/03/africa/OUKWD-UK-PALESTINIANS-GAZA.php Donors Pledge £3.2 billion for Gaza]</ref>India which is aspiring to be recognized as 'Globally respected power' has made concerted efforts in fostering better relations with PA. When PAP President Abbas visited New Delhi in 2008 he was offered a credit of US$ 20 million (Rs.900 million) by Indian Federal Government. India also continued to offer eight scholarships under ICCR Schemes to Palestinian students for higher studies in India, while also offering several slots for training courses under the ITEC Program.  .

The lion's share of the aid comes from the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]].

In March 2011, there were threats to cut off aid for the PA if it continued to move forward on a unity government with Hamas, unless Hamas formally renounced violence, recognized Israel, and accepted previous Israel-Palestinian agreements. <ref name="KeinonToameh">Herb Keinon and Khaled Abu Toameh, [http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=213947] 'J'lem to cut ties with PA if Hamas added to unity gov't', March 27, 2011, Jerusalem Post</ref>  [[Azzam Ahmed]], spokesman for Palestinian Authority President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] responded by stating that the PA was willing to give up financial aid in order to achieve unity, "Palestinians need American money, but if they use it as a way of pressuring us, we are ready to relinquish that aid."<ref name="staff">[http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?ID=214180&R=R1] 'Abbas would give up US aid to reconcile with Hamas' March 28, 2011, Jerusalem Post. </ref> . 

===Major donors===. 
[[File:Emergency aid to Gaza in 2009.PNG|thumb|right|Map of countries giving emergency aid to Gaza in 2009]]
According to the [[Development Assistance Committee]], the main multilateral donors for the 2006–2007 period were [[UNRWA]] and the EU (through the [[European Commission]]); the main bilateral donors were the US, Japan, [[Canada]] and five European countries ([[Norway]], [[Germany]], [[Sweden]], [[Spain]] and [[France]]). <ref>[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/23/38/1882818.gif Palestinian Adm. Areas], DAC-OECD</ref> Since 1993 the European Commission and the EU member-states combined have been by far the largest aid contributor to the Palestinians. <ref>Le More (2005), 982</ref> The Arab League states have also been substantial donors, notably through budgetary support to the PNA during the Second Intifada; they have been however criticized for not sufficiently financing the UNRWA and the PNA, and for balking at their pledges. <ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/841721.html#resp At Riyadh Summit], Associated Press; Freund, [http://freund.typepad.com/my_weblog/2007/02/do_arab_states_.html Do Arab States really Care about the Palestinians?]; [http://www.biu.ac.il/Besa/books/36pub.html#D Rubin (1998)]</ref> After the 2006 Palestinian elections, the Arab countries tried to contribute to the payment of the Palestinian public servants' wages, bypassing the PNA; at the same time Arab funds were paid directly to Abbas' office for disbursement. <ref>Two Years after London (2007), [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/AHLCMainReportfinalSept18&cover.pdf 30]</ref> During the Paris Conference, 11% of the pledges came from the US and Canada, 53% from Europe and 20% from the Arab countries. <ref name="WB10" /> . 

==Structure==. 
===Donor coordination===. 
Since 1993, a complex structure for donor coordination has been put in place in an effort to balance competing American and European positions, facilitate agenda-setting, reduce duplication, and foster synergies. <ref>Aid Effectiveness (1999), 34; Le More (2004), 213</ref> The overall monitoring of the donors' activities was assigned to the Ad-Hoc Liaison Committee, which was established in November 1993, operates on the basis of consensus, and aims at promoting the dialogue between the partners of the "triangular partnership", namely the donors, Israel, and the PNA. <ref>Brynen (2002), 92; [http://www.usip.org/pubs/usipeace_briefings/2006/0810_aid_palestine.html Lasensky-Grace (2006)]; Le More (2004), 213</ref> .
