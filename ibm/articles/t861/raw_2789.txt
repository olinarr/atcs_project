{{Gaza Strip}}
[[image:Gaza City.JPG|thumb|Gaza city skyline]]
The '''Gaza Strip''' ({{Lang-ar|قطاع غزة}} {{Transl|ar|DIN|''Qiṭāʿ Ġazzah''}}, {{IPA-ar|qitˤaːʕ ɣazza|IPA}}) lies on the Eastern coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], within the [[Middle East]] (at 31 25 N, 34 20 E). The Strip borders [[Egypt]] on the southwest, 11km long, and [[Israel]] on the east and north, 51km long. It is about {{convert|41|km|mi}} long, and between 6 and 12&nbsp;kilometres (4–7.5&nbsp;mi) wide, with a total area of {{convert|360|km2|sqmi}}. It has a 40 km coastline onto the [[Mediterranean Sea]], but has no maritime claims due to Israeli administration. The territory takes its name from [[Gaza]]-city, its main city and administrative center.  . 

The Gaza Strip has a [[temperate]] climate, with mild winters, and dry and hot summers, subject to [[drought]]. The terrain is flat or rolling, with [[dune]]s near the coast. The highest point is [[Abu 'Awdah]] ([[Joz Abu 'Auda]]), at 105 metres above sea level. Main resources are [[arable land]] (about a third of the strip is irrigated), and recently discovered [[natural gas]]. Environmental issues include [[desertification]]; [[salination]] of fresh water; [[sewage treatment]]; [[water-borne disease]]; [[soil degradation]]; and depletion and contamination of [[underground water]] resources.  . 

The population of Gaza Strip is about 1.7 million people,<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gz.html Gaza Strip] Entry at the CIA World Factbook</ref> most of them descendants of refugees. One million of the population, as of March 2005, were considered [[Palestinian refugee|refugees]], although the vast majority of them were actually born in the Gaza Strip;<ref name=Cobhamp179>Cobham and Kanafani, 2004, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=EjOnENtFLfgC&pg=PA179&dq=%22population+of+gaza%22+refugees&lr=#v=onepage&q=%22population%20of%20gaza%22%20refugees&f=false p. 179]. </ref> the older generation fled to Gaza in 1948 as part of the [[1948 Palestinian exodus]] following the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], from some parts of [[Mandate Palestine]] that became Israel. The population is predominantly [[Sunni Muslim]]. With a yearly growth rate of about 3.2%, the Gaza strip has the 7th highest [[List of countries by population growth rate|population growth rate]] in the world. <ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gz.html Gaza Strip] Entry at the CIA World Factbook</ref> . 

The Gaza Strip acquired its current boundaries at the cessation of fighting in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], which was confirmed in the [[1949 Armistice Agreements|Israel-Egypt Armistice Agreement]] on 24 February 1949. <ref>[http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/9EC4A332E2FF9A128525643D007702E6 Egypt Israel Armistice Agreement] UN Doc S/1264/Corr.1 23 February 1949</ref> Article V of the Agreement declared that the demarcation line was not to be an international border. The Gaza Strip continued to be occupied by Egypt. At first Gaza Strip was officially administered by the [[All-Palestine Government]], established by the Arab League in September 1948. Since the dissolution of the All-Palestine Government in 1959 and until 1967, the Gaza Strip was directly administered by Egyptian military governor.  . 

In 1967, Israel occupied it following the [[Six-Day War]]. Pursuant to the [[Oslo Accords]] signed between Israel and the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] in 1993, the [[Palestinian Authority]] was set up as an interim administrative body to govern Palestinian population centres, with Israel maintaining control of Gaza Strip's [[airspace]], all but one of its land borders and [[territorial waters]], until a final agreement could be reached. As agreement remained elusive, [[Israel's unilateral disengagement|Israel unilaterally disengaged]] from Gaza in 2005.  . 

The Gaza Strip is one of the territorial units forming the [[Palestinian territories]]. <ref name="PalestinianTerritories-U.S.DeptofState">{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/p/nea/ci/pt/index.htm|title=Palestinian Territories|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=2009-04-06}}</ref><ref name="EU-OccupiedPalestinianTerritory">{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/occupied_palestinian_territory/index_en.htm|title=Occupied Palestinian Territory|publisher=European Commission |accessdate=2009-04-06}}</ref><ref name="ICRC-map">{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/map_israel!OpenDocument|title=Israel, the occupied territories and the autonomous territories&nbsp;— ICRC maps|publisher=ICRC|accessdate=2009-04-06}}</ref><ref name="BBC-Countryprofile">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/country_profiles/803257.stm|title=Country profile: Israel and Palestinian territories|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-04-06 | date=15 December 2009 | location=London}}</ref> Since July 2007, following the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006|2006 Palestinian legislative election]] and the following [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|Battle of Gaza]], [[Hamas]] has functioned as the ''de-facto'' ruler in the Gaza Strip, forming an alternative [[Hamas Government in Gaza]].  . 

==History==. 
{{see|History of Gaza}}
===British rule (1923–1948)===. 
{{Main|British Mandate for Palestine}}
[[The Palestine Mandate]] was based on the principles contained in Article 22 of the draft [[Covenant of the League of Nations]] and the [[San Remo conference|San Remo Resolution]] of 25 April 1920 by the principal [[Allies of World War I|Allied and associated powers]] after the First World War. <ref name=cmd5479>[http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/88A6BF6F1BD82405852574CD006C457F Palestine Royal Commission Report Presented by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to Parliament by Command of His Majesty, July 1937, Cmd. 5479]. His Majesty’s Stationery Office., London, 1937. 404 pages + maps. </ref> The mandate formalised [[British Empire|British]] rule in the southern part of [[Ottoman Syria]] from 1923–1948.  . 

===All-Palestine government===. 
On 22 September 1948, towards the end of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the [[All-Palestine Government]] was proclaimed in the Egyptian occupied Gaza City by the [[Arab League]]. It was conceived partly as an Arab League attempt to limit the influence of [[Transjordan]] in Palestine. The All-Palestine Government was quickly recognized by six of the then seven members of the Arab League: [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Iraq]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Yemen]], but not by [[Transjordan]]. <ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/all-palestine-government All-Palestine Government, by Shlaim, Avi]</ref> It was not recognised by any country outside the Arab League.  . 

After the cessation of hostilities, the [[1949 Armistice Agreements#With Egypt|Israel-Egypt Armistice Agreement]] of 24 February 1949 established the separation line between Egyptian and Israeli forces, and established what became the present boundary between the Gaza Strip and Israel. Both sides declared that the boundary was not to be an international border. The southern border with Egypt continued to be the international border which had been drawn in 1906 between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[British Empire]]. <ref>{{cite book|title=The Land of the Negev (English title)|publisher=[[Israeli Defense Minitsry|Ministry of Defense]] Publishing|editor=Gardus, Yehuda; Shmueli, Avshalom|year=1978–79}} {{he icon}}, pp. 369–370</ref> . 

The population of the Gaza Strip had been greatly augmented by an influx of [[Palestinian refugees]] who fled from Israel before and during the fighting. Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip or Egypt were issued All-Palestine passports. Egypt did not offer the Palestinians citizenship. From the end of 1949, they received aid from [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East|UNRWA]].  . 

During the [[Suez Crisis|Sinai campaign of November 1956]], the Gaza Strip and the [[Sinai Peninsula]] were occupied by Israeli troops.  International pressure led Israel to withdraw.  . 

The government was accused of being little more than a façade for Egyptian control, with negligible independent funding or influence. It subsequently moved to [[Cairo]] and was dissolved in 1959, by decree of [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]], President of Egypt.  . 

===Egyptian occupation (1959–1967)===. 
{{Main|Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt}}
Since the dissolution of the All-Palestine Government in 1959, under the excuse of the pan-Arabism, Egypt continued to occupy the Gaza Strip until 1967. Egypt never annexed the Gaza Strip, but instead treated it as a controlled territory and administered it through a military governor. <ref>[http://israelipalestinian.procon.org/view.answers.php?questionID=000503 "How has the Gaza Strip influenced the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?"] entry at ProCon.org citing "An Historical Encyclopedia of the Arab-Israeli Conflict"</ref> . 

===Israeli occupation (1967–1994/2005)===. 
Israel controlled the Gaza Strip again beginning in June 1967, after the [[Six-Day War]]. During the period of Israeli control, Israel created a settlement bloc, [[Gush Katif]], in the southwest corner of the Strip near [[Rafah]] and the Egyptian border.  In total Israel created 21 settlements in the Gaza Strip, comprising 20% of the total territory.  Besides ideological reasons for being there, these settlements also served Israel's security concerns.  . 

In March 1979 Israel and Egypt signed the [[Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty]]. Among other things, the treaty provided for the withdrawal by Israel of its armed forces and civilians from the Sinai Peninsula, which Israel had captured during the Six-Day War, to the 1906 international border.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The Egyptians agreed to keep the Sinai Peninsula demilitarized.  The final status of the Gaza Strip, and other relations between Israel and Palestinians, was not dealt with in the treaty. Egypt renounced all territorial claims to territory north of the international border.  . 

The Gaza Strip remained under Israeli military administration until 1994. During that period the military was responsible for the maintenance of civil facilities and services. In May 1994, following the Palestinian-Israeli agreements known as the [[Oslo Accords]], a phased transfer of governmental authority to the Palestinians took place.  Much of the Strip (except for the settlement blocs and military areas) came under Palestinian control.  The Israeli forces left Gaza City and other urban areas, leaving the new Palestinian Authority to administer and police those areas.  The Palestinian Authority, led by [[Yasser Arafat]], chose Gaza City as its first provincial headquarters.  In September 1995, Israel and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] signed [[Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip|a second peace agreement]], extending the Palestinian Authority to most [[West Bank]] towns.  The agreement also established an elected 88-member [[Palestinian National Council]], which held its inaugural session in Gaza in March 1996.  . 

The Palestinian Authority rule of the Gaza Strip and West Bank under the leadership of Arafat suffered from serious mismanagement and corruption scandals.  For example, exorbitant bribes were demanded for allowing goods to pass in and out of the Gaza Strip, while heads of the Preventive Security Service apparatus profited from their involvement in the gravel import and cement and construction industries, such as the Great Arab Company for Investment and Development, the al-Motawaset Company, and the al-Sheik Zayid construction project. <ref>{{cite web|last=Samuels |first=David |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200509/samuels/8 |title=The Atlantic |publisher=The Atlantic |date= |accessdate=2010-06-01}}</ref> . 

The [[Second Intifada]] broke out in September 2000 with its waves of protest, civil unrest and bombings against Israeli military and civilians, many of them perpetrated by suicide bombers, and the beginning of rockets and bombings of Israeli border localities by Palestinian guerrillas from Gaza Strip, especially from Hamas and Jihad Islami movements. In February 2005, the Israeli government voted to implement a [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|unilateral disengagement plan]] from the Gaza Strip.  The plan began to be implemented on 15 August 2005, and was completed on 12 September 2005. Under the plan, all [[Israeli settlement]]s in the Gaza Strip (and four in the West Bank) and the joint Israeli-Palestinian Erez Industrial Zone were dismantled with the removal of all 9,000 Israeli settlers (most of them in the [[Gush Katif]] settlement area in the Strip's southwest) and military bases.  On 12 September 2005 the Israeli cabinet formally declared an end to Israeli military occupation of the Gaza Strip.  To avoid allegations that it was still in occupation of any part of the Gaza Strip, Israel also withdrew from the [[Philadelphi Route]], which is a narrow strip adjacent to the Strip's border with Egypt, after Egypt's agreement to secure its side of the border.  Under the Oslo Accords the Philadelphi Route was to remain under Israeli control to prevent the smuggling of materials (such as ammunition) and people across the border with Egypt.  With Egypt agreeing to patrol its side of the border, it was hoped that the objective would be achieved.  However, Israel maintained its control over the crossings in and out of Gaza.  The Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza was monitored by the Israeli army through special surveillance cameras.  Official documents such as passports, I.D. cards, export and import papers, and many others had to be approved by the Israeli army.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} . 

====Israel-Gaza Strip barrier====. 
{{Main|Israel–Gaza Strip barrier}}
Between 1994 and 1996, Israel built the Israeli Gaza Strip barrier. The [[separation barrier]] was first constructed to improve security in Israel. The barrier was largely torn down by Palestinians at the beginning of the [[Al-Aqsa Intifada]] in September 2000. <ref name="Doron Almog">{{Cite document |title=Lessons of the Gaza Security Fence for the West Bank |author=Almog, Major General Doron |publisher=Jerusalem Centre for Public Affairs |date=2004-12-23 |volume=4 |edition=12 |url=http://www.jcpa.org/brief/brief004-12.htm |postscript=<!--None--> }}</ref> Between December 2000 and June 2001, the barrier fence between the Gaza Strip and Israel was reconstructed.

===2005 – Israel's unilateral disengagement===. 
The [[Israel Defence Forces]] left the Gaza Strip on 1 September 2005 as part of [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan]], and all Israeli citizens were evicted from the area. An 'Agreement on Movement and Access' between Israel and the [[Palestinian Authority]] was brokered by [[Condoleezza Rice]] in November 2005 to improve Palestinian freedom of movement and economic activity in the Gaza Strip. Under its terms, the [[Rafah]] crossing with [[Egypt]] was to be reopened, with transits monitored by the Palestinian National Authority and the [[European Union]]. Only people with Palestinian ID, or foreign nationals, by exception, in certain categories, subject to Israeli oversight, were permitted to cross in and out. All goods, vehicles and trucks to and from Egypt had to pass through the Israeli crossing at [[Kerem Shalom]], under full Israeli supervision. <ref>[[Tanya Reinhart]], ''The Road to Nowhere,'' Verso, London 2006 pp.134-5</ref> Goods were also permitted transit at the [[Karni crossing]] in the north.  . 

====Legal status====. 
[[image:Al Deira Hotel Gaza April 2009.jpg|thumb|Al Deira hotel on the Gaza coast]]
The UN, [[Human Rights Watch]] and many other international bodies and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] consider Israel to be the occupying power of the Gaza Strip as Israel controls Gaza's airspace and territorial waters, and does not allow the movement of goods in or out of Gaza by air or sea (only by land). <ref name="AI_briefing">{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE15/007/2009/en/4c407b40-e64c-11dd-9917-ed717fa5078d/mde150072009en.html|title=Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territories: The conflict in Gaza: A briefing on applicable law, investigations and accountability|date=2009-01-19|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|accessdate=2009-06-05}}</ref><ref name="isrlpa13698">[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/07/06/isrlpa13698.htm "Human Rights Council Special Session on the Occupied Palestinian Territories"] July 6, 2006; Human Rights Watch considers Gaza still occupied. </ref><ref name="cnn2009-01-06">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/01/06/israel.gaza.occupation.question/index.html|title=Is Gaza 'occupied' territory?|last=Levs|first=Josh|date=2009-01-06|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2009-05-30}}</ref> However, the border crossing into Egypt is not controlled by Israel; similar to Israel, Egypt has alternately restricted or allowed goods and people to cross that terrestrial border.

===Palestinian Authority control (1994–2007)===. 
In accordance with the [[Oslo Accords]], the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] took over the administrative authority of the Gaza Strip (other than the settlement blocs and military areas) in 1994. After the complete [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|Israeli withdrawal]] of Israeli settlers and military from the Gaza Strip on 12 September 2005, the Palestinian Authority had complete administrative authority in the Gaza Strip. Since the Israeli withdrawal the [[Rafah Border Crossing]] had been supervised by [[European Union Border Assistance Mission Rafah|EU Border Assistance Mission Rafah]] under an Agreement finalised in November 2005. <ref>{{Cite book

In the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006|Palestinian parliamentary elections]] held on January 25, 2006, [[Hamas]] won a plurality of 42.9% of the total vote and 74 out of 132 total seats (56%). <ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/01/25/africa/web.0125pals.php Counting underway in Palestinian elections], International Herald Tribune, 25 January 2006. </ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200601/s1557518.htm Election officials reduce [[Hamas]] seats by two], ABC News Online, 30 January 2006. </ref>  When Hamas assumed power the next month, the Israeli government and the key players of the international community, the United States and the EU refused to recognize its right to govern the [[Palestinian Authority]].

===Hamas control (2007–present)===. 
Following the victory of Hamas in the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006|2006 Palestinian legislative election]], Hamas and [[Fatah]] formed a [[Palestinan authority national unity government]] headed by [[Ismail Haniya]]. Shortly after, Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in the course of the [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|Battle of Gaza]],<ref name=Guardian>{{cite news|title=Hamas takes control of Gaza|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/jun/15/israel4|accessdate=3 June 2010|newspaper=Guardian|date=Friday 15 June 2007 | location=London | first1=Ian | last1=Black | first2=Mark | last2=Tran}}</ref> seizing government institutions and replacing Fatah and other government officials with its own. <ref name="intern_fight_p14-15">{{cite book | title= Internal fight: Palestinian abuses in Gaza and the West Bank | pages= 14–15 | author2= [[Human Rights Watch]] | first1= Fred | last1= Abrahams | publisher= [[Human Rights Watch]] | year= 2008 }}</ref> By 14 June, Hamas fully controlled the Gaza Strip. [[President of the Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian President]] [[Mahmoud Abbas]] responded by declaring a [[state of emergency]], dissolving the unity government and forming a new government without Hamas participation. [[Preventive Security Service|PNA security forces]] in the [[West Bank]] arrested a number of Hamas members.  . 

Abbas's government received widespread international support. In late June 2008 Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia said that the West Bank-based Cabinet formed by Abbas was the sole legitimate Palestinian government, and Egypt moved its embassy from Gaza to the West Bank. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/874106.html |title=Mubarak calls Hamas' takeover of the Gaza Strip a 'coup'|publisher= Haaretz Daily Newspaper|date= |accessdate=2011-05-21}}</ref> The Hamas government in the Gaza Strip faces international, diplomatic, and economic isolation. 
[[image:Watchtower rafah gaza strip april 2009.jpg|thumb|Watchtower, Rafah border with Egypt]]
Both [[Saudi Arabia]] and Egypt supported reconciliation and the forming of a new unity government, and pressed Abbas to start serious talks with Hamas. Abbas had always conditioned this on Hamas' returning control of the Gaza Strip to the Palestinian Authority. Hamas has been invited to and has visited a number of countries, including Russia, and the [[European Union|EU]] member states. Opposition parties and politicians have also called for a dialogue with Hamas as well as an end to the economic sanctions.  . 

After the takeover, Israel and Egypt [[blockade of the Gaza Strip|closed their border crossings with Gaza]]. Palestinian sources reported that European Union monitors fled the [[Rafah Border Crossing]], on the Gaza–Egypt border for fear of being kidnapped or harmed. <ref name=EU_flee_Rafah_crossing>{{cite web|last=Dudkevitch |first=Margot |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1139395602714 |title=EU monitors flee Rafah border crossing|publisher=Jerusalem Post |date=2006-03-14 |accessdate=2011-05-21}}</ref> Arab foreign ministers and Palestinian officials presented a united front against control of the border by Hamas. <ref name="Abbas wins Egypt backing on border">{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2008/01/2008525125823983496.html |title=Middle East&nbsp;— Abbas wins Egypt backing on border |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=2008-01-28 |accessdate=2010-06-01}}</ref> . 

Meanwhile, Israeli and Egyptian security reports said that Hamas continued smuggling in large quantities of explosives and arms from Egypt through tunnels.

====After the Hamas takeover====. 
After Hamas' June win, it ousted Fatah-linked officials from positions of power and authority (such as government positions, security services, universities, newspapers, etc.) and strove to enforce law by progressively removing guns from the hands of peripheral militias, clans, and criminal groups, and gaining control of supply tunnels.

In January 2008, Israel curtailed travel from Gaza, the entry of goods, and cut fuel supplies, resulting in power shortages. This brought charges that Israel was inflicting [[collective punishment]] on the Gaza population, leading to international condemnation.

At the same time, Israel increased its state of alert along the length of the Israel-Egypt Sinai border, and warned its citizens to leave Sinai "without delay." . 

The EU Border Monitors indicated their readiness to return to monitor the border, should Hamas guarantee their safety; while the Palestinian Authority demanded that Egypt deal only with the Authority in negotiations relating to borders. Israel eased up some influx of goods and medical supplies to the strip, but it curtailed electricity by 5% in one of its ten lines, while Hamas and Egypt shored up some of the gaping holes between the two areas. <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1201523779483&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080202031535/http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?c=JPArticle&cid=1201523779483&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|archivedate=2008-02-02|title=Fatah, Hamas fight for border control|last=Abu Toameh|first=Khaled|date=January 29, 2008|publisher=Jerusalem Post|accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref> The first attempts by Egypt to reclose the border were met by violent clashes with Gaza gunmen, but after 12 days the borders were sealed again.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} <!-- BROKEN LINK:<ref>http://rafah.virtualactivism.net/news/todaymain.htm</ref> --> .

Director of the [[Shin Bet]] (Israel Security Agency) [[Yuval Diskin]] has said he would not oppose the loosening of trade restrictions, but believed that [[smuggling tunnel]]s in the Sinai and an open seaport in the Gaza Strip endangered the security of Israel.

Gaza cannot and must not be allowed to remain a prison camp." <ref name="Cameron">{{cite news|last=Watt|first=Nicholas|title=David Cameron: Israeli blockade has turned Gaza Strip into a 'prison camp'|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/jul/27/david-cameron-gaza-prison-camp|accessdate=28 July 2010|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2010-07-27 | location=London}}</ref> In response, the spokesman for the [[Embassy of Israel, London|Israeli embassy in London]] said "The people of Gaza are the prisoners of the terrorist organisation Hamas. The situation in Gaza is the direct result of Hamas' rule and priorities."

The IDF strictly controls travel within the area of the crossing points between Israel and the Gaza Strip, and has sealed its border with Gaza.  The security environment within Gaza and along its borders, including its border with Egypt and its seacoast, is dangerous and can change at any time. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/tw/tw_922.html |title=Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Travel Warning |publisher=Travel.state.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-06-01}}</ref> . 

Facing mounting international calls to ease or lift their blockade, Egypt and Israel lessened the restrictions starting in June 2010, when the Rafah border crossing from Egypt to Gaza has been partially opened by Egypt, and Egypt’s foreign ministry has made it clear that the crossing will remain open mainly for people, but not for supplies, to go through. <ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2010/0602/Egypt-eases-own-Gaza-blockade-after-Israel-Freedom-Flotilla-raid Egypt eases own Gaza blockade after Israel Freedom Flotilla raid], Christian Science Monitor, June 2, 2010 (page 2)</ref> Israel announced that it will allow all strictly civilian goods into Gaza while preventing certain weapons and dual-use items from entering the Hamas-run Gaza. <ref name="google1">{{cite web|last=Rabinowitz |first=Gavin |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hYVYAfX_Mu7L_Kv-VU_3g4XdDiSA |title=AFP: Israel to allow more 'civilian' goods into Gaza: official |publisher=Google.com |date=2010-06-20 |accessdate=2010-12-12}}</ref> . 

====Islamization trend====. 
{{main|Islamization of the Gaza Strip}}
From 1987 to 1991, during the [[first intifada]], Hamas campaigned for the wearing of the hijab alongside other measures, including insisting women stay at home be segregated from men, and the promotion of polygamy. In the course of this campaign women who chose not to wear the hijab were verbally and physically harassed, with the result that the hijab was being worn 'just to avoid problems on the streets'. <ref name="Ruben">Rubenberg, C., ''Palestinian Women: Patriarchy and Resistance in the West Bank'' (USA, 2001) p.230-231</ref> . 

Since Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in 2007, some of its members have attempted to impose Islamic dress or the [[Hijab]] head covering on women. <ref name="ReferenceB">[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/world/middleeast/06gaza.html Hamas Fights Over Gaza’s Islamist Identity] New York Times, September 5, 2009</ref><ref name="xinhua">{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2010-01/03/content_12748559.htm |title=Hamas encourages Gaza women to follow Islamic code|publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=2010-01-03 |accessdate=2011-05-21}}</ref> Also, the government’s "Islamic Endowment Ministry" has deployed Virtue Committee members to warn citizens of the dangers of immodest dress, card playing and dating. <ref name="bloomberg">[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aB2RfynNbLmk Hamas Bans Women Dancers, Scooter Riders in Gaza Push] By Daniel Williams, Bloomberg, November 30, 2009</ref> However, there are no government laws imposing dress and other moral standards, and the Hamas education ministry reversed one effort to impose Islamic dress on students. <ref name="ReferenceB"/> There has also been successful resistance to attempts by local Hamas officials to impose Islamic dress on women. <ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/oct/18/hamas-gaza-islamist-dress-code Hamas patrols beaches in Gaza to enforce conservative dress code] The Guardian (UK), October 18, 2009</ref> . 

According to [[Human Rights Watch]], the Hamas-controlled government of Gaza stepped up its efforts to "Islamize" Gaza in 2010, efforts that included, according to the organization, the "repression of civil society" and "severe violations of personal freedom."<ref name=Esveld>[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/27/opinion/la-oe-vanesveld-gaza-20100627  "In Gaza, prisoners twice over; Palestinians are being squeezed by the Israeli blockade and Hamas' 'Islamizing' actions,"] Bill Van Esveld, Bill Van Esveld is a Middle East researcher for Human Rights Watch, June 27, 201o, Los Angelies Times. </ref> . 

[[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] researcher Dr. [[Khaled Al-Hroub]] has criticized what he called the "[[Taliban]]-like steps" Hamas has taken. He wrote, "The Islamization that has been forced upon the Gaza Strip – the suppression of social, cultural, and press freedoms that do not suit Hamas's view[s] – is an egregious deed that must be opposed. It is the reenactment, under a religious guise, of the experience of [other] totalitarian regimes and dictatorships. <ref>The Hamas Enterprise and the Talibanization of Gaza, by Khaled Al-Hroub, Al-Ayyam (Palestinian Authority), October 11, 2010. [http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4696.htm Translation] by the Middle East Research Institute, October 22, 2010. </ref> . 

Hamas officials denied having any plans to impose Islamic law, one legislator stating that “What you are seeing are incidents, not policy,” and that Islamic law is the desired standard "but we believe in persuasion.”<ref name="bloomberg"/> . 

====Israel's cooperation with international aid programs====. 
In January and February 2011, the [[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] (UNOCHA) conducted an assessment of the effects of the measures to ease the access restrictions. <ref name=ocha201103>{{cite web|title=Easing the blockade – Assessing the humanitarian impact on the population of the Gaza Strip|url=http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_special_easing_the_blockade_2011_03_english.pdf|publisher=UNITED NATIONS Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs occupied Palestinian territory|accessdate=16 July 2011|date=March 2011}}</ref> They concluded that they did not result in a significant improvement in people’s livelihoods. <ref name=ocha201103/> They found that the "pivotal nature of the remaining restrictions" and the effects of three years of strict blockade prevented a significant improvement in livelihoods and called on Israel to fully abolish the blockade including removing restrictions on the import of construction materials and the exports of goods, and to lift the general ban on the movement of people between Gaza and the West Bank via Israel in order to comply with what they described as international humanitarian and human rights law obligations. <ref name=ocha201103/> . 

==Geography and climate==. 
[[image:Southeast mediterranean annotated geography.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Principal geographical features of Israel and south-eastern Mediterranean region]]
[[image:Gaza Beach.jpg|thumb|right|Gaza beach]] . 

The Gaza Strip is located in the Middle East (at {{Coord|31|25|N|34|20|E|region:PS_type:adm1st_scale:300000|display=inline,title}}). It has a {{convert|51|km|mi}} border with [[Israel]], and an 11&nbsp;km border with [[Egypt]], near the city of [[Rafah]].  [[Khan Yunis]] is located {{convert|7|km|mi}} northeast of Rafah, and several towns around [[Deir el-Balah]] are located along the coast between it and [[Gaza|Gaza City]]. [[Beit Lahia]] and [[Beit Hanoun]] are located to the north and northeast of Gaza City, respectively. The [[Gush Katif]] bloc of Israeli localities used to exist on the [[dune|sand dune]]s adjacent to Rafah and Khan Yunis, along the southwestern edge of the {{convert|40|km|mi}} [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coastline.  . 

Gaza strip has an arid climate, with mild winters, and dry, hot summers subject to [[drought]].  The terrain is flat or rolling, with dunes near the coast.  The highest point is Abu 'Awdah (Joz Abu 'Auda), at {{convert|105|m|ft}} above [[sea level]].  Natural resources include [[arable land]] (about a third of the strip is irrigated), and recently discovered [[natural gas]].  Environmental issues include [[desertification]]; [[Biosalinity|salination]] of fresh water; [[sewage treatment]]; [[water-borne disease]]; [[soil degradation]]; and depletion and contamination of underground water resources.  .
