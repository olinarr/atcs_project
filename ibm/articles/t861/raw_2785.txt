Now, any isolated incident becomes a global drama, and it's becoming worse. We are reaching the stage when Israel's ability to defend itself will no longer exist." She said the lack of policy in the aftermath of the incident would jeopardize Israel's legitimacy and backing from the international community, which she says for years had insisted on not recognizing Hamas until it recognizes Israel and accepts past agreements, and had accepted the closure of Gaza while "it was clear that Israel wanted an agreement with pragmatic forces, with the legitimate Palestinian government."

''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' asked several questions regarding the responsibility for the clash, while saying there was still much to be learned about the incident. While saying "As is so often the case with events involving Israelis and Palestinians, the competing narratives allow supporters of almost any position to hear what they want to hear." The editorial made its own affirmation that "This much, however, seems undeniable: Israel has done itself serious damage. [This was because] the decision to deploy armed troops to obstruct what was apparently a nonviolent mission and then, even if you accept Israel's version of events, to allow them to be drawn into a battle that left so many civilians dead, will serve as a further blow to the ailing peace process and as more fodder for those who argue that Israel's 'disproportionate' use of force is evidence of a cavalier attitude toward human life." While admitting the raid would not focus new attention on attention on the blockade itself, the editorial also concluded in saying that "This page supports Israel's right to self-defense. We support reasonable measures to stop cross-border shelling and to keep weapons from illegally entering Gaza by land or sea. We oppose the Hamas government's consistent call for the destruction of Israel. But we also want to see an end to the blockade, which amounts to collective punishment of about 1.5 million Palestinians."<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/02/opinion/la-ed-israel-20100602-18 Israel's self-inflicted wound]</ref> . 

''[[The New York Times]]'' quoted a statement allegedly from the flotilla organizers saying "A violent response from Israel will breathe new life into the Palestine solidarity movement, drawing attention to the blockade." They then said "There can be no excuse for the way that Israel completely mishandled the incident." And that the raid turned out to be "a grievous, self-inflicted wound. It has damaged Israel’s ties with Turkey, once its closest ally in the Muslim world; given the Hamas-led government in Gaza a huge propaganda boost; and complicated peace talks with the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank." It also asks "Why did Israel, which has blocked some ships but allowed others to pass, decide to take a stand now? Did it make a real effort to find a compromise with Turkey, which sanctioned the flotilla? [While] Israel has a right to stop weapons from going into Gaza, but there has been no suggestion that the ships were carrying a large cache." The ''Times'' concludes that "needs to state clearly that the Israeli attack was unacceptable and back an impartial international investigation. The United States should also join the other permanent members of the United Nations Security Council — Britain, France, Russia and China — in urging Israel to permanently lift the blockade."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/02/opinion/02wed1.html Israel and the Blockade]</ref> Another editorial said "Turkey is understandably furious" but "Turkish officials have let their anger and rhetoric go way too far... Israel deserves to be criticized for the flotilla disaster. But gratuitously stoking anti-Israeli sentiment is irresponsible and dangerous."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/05/opinion/05sat2.html Turkey's Fury]</ref> . 

''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'' called the said a "disaster on every level." It also contended that Israel's "enemies could not have scripted a more bungled operation:...setting off recriminations, policy breaches and deepening isolation for Israel... 
The peace process, already in the cryogenic stage, is at full stop...The episode reruns old stories. Palestinian sympathizers wanted a confrontation over Israel's blockade of Hamas-run Gaza...and ignored offers to dock in Israeli ports and ship the aid by land. ... Another horrifying Mideast moment will live on to paralyze progress in the future... 
The purpose was clearly to call attention to the blockade, viewed as essential by Israel to cap terrorism, and regarded as harsh and unsuccessful by critics." It concluded that "There is no other course than to admit a serious mistake. Without one, the region is condemned to a future without change or hope."<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/06/01/EDRK1DO2GN.DTL Israel's raid on flotilla deepens its isolation]</ref> . 

In an [[op-ed]] piece the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' said "Israel's actions in boarding the flotilla of ships bound for the Gaza Strip were entirely justified and perhaps even unavoidable."

After describing the links between the Islamic charity that organized the flotilla and terrorist groups, the ''Journal'' states "No wonder that Israel was not prepared to let this flotilla break its blockade of Gaza. ... Israel is entirely within its rights to prevent Hamas from linking with groups suspected of supplying arms and money to terrorists. Israel had also gone out of its way to give Turkey fair warning..." The ''Journal'' goes on to note that Turkish foreign policy under Erdogan has become progressively radical and out of line with the U.S. <ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703561604575282423181610814.html Turkey's Radical Drift]</ref><!--link is not verifiable--> . 

''[[The Washington Post]]'' said the raid was a "diplomatic debacle for the government of Binyamin Netanyahu." And that "Though the investigations to come will find many to blame, it's already clear that Israel's response to the pro-Palestinian flotilla was both misguided and badly executed." The editorial also said that "We have no sympathy for the motives of the participants in the flotilla... What's plain is that the group's nominal purpose, delivering 'humanitarian' supplies to Gaza, was secondary to the aim of provoking a confrontation." While saying "Yet the threat to Israel was political rather than military. So far there's been no indication the boats carried missiles or other arms for Hamas." It continued "Mr. Netanyahu's aim should have been to prevent the militants (''[[sic]]'') from creating the incident they were hoping for. Allowing the boats to dock in Gaza, as Israel had done before, would have been better than sending military commandos to intercept them. The fact that the soldiers who roped down from helicopters to the lead Turkish ferry were unprepared to subdue its passengers without using lethal force only compounded the error." It concluded that "The prime minister (Netanyahu) is in a deepening hole; his only way out is to move to the center."<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/31/AR2010053103160.html The flotilla fiasco]</ref> Another editorial stated that while "Western governments have been right to be concerned about Israel's poor judgment...[they] ought to be at least as worried about the Turkish government...which...has shown a sympathy toward Islamic militants and a penchant for grotesque demagoguery toward Israel that ought to be unacceptable for a member of NATO." In reference to Turkey's statement that "Israel had no just cause to clash with 'European lawmakers, journalists, business leaders, and a Holocaust survivor,' the article noted that "there was no fighting with those people, or with five of the six boats in the fleet. All of the violence occurred aboard the Turkish ferry ''Mavi Marmara'', and all of those who were killed were members or volunteers for the Islamic 'charity' that owned the ship." The editorial claimed that the İHH "is a member of the 'Union of Good,' a coalition that was formed to provide material support to Hamas and that was named as a terrorist entity by the United States in 2008." It then said that "The relationship between Mr. Erdogan's government and the İHH ought to be one focus of any international investigation into the incident." The article claims that "In the days since an incident that the İHH admits it provoked [Erdogan] has done his best to compete with Iran's [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] and Hezbollah's [[Hassan Nasrallah]] in attacking the Jewish state [and calling] Israel's actions 'state terrorism.' [and Israel] merciless, rootless state." The editorial labeles Davutoglu's comparison saying "this attack is like 9/11 for Turkey" as an "obscene comparison." The article attacked Erdogan in saying his "attempt to exploit the incident comes only a couple of weeks after he joined Brazil's president in linking arms with Mr. Ahmadinejad, whom he is assisting in an effort to block [[Nuclear program of Iran#Uranium enrichment|new UN sanctions]]." The article mentions that Turkey's moves came despite the Obama administration overtures. "What's remarkable about his turn toward extremism is that it comes after more than a year of assiduous courting by the Obama administration, which, among other things, has overlooked his antidemocratic behavior at home, helped him combat the Kurdish PKK and catered to Turkish sensitivities about the Armenian genocide. Israel is suffering the consequences of its misjudgments and disregard of U.S. interests. Will Mr. Erdogan's behavior be without cost?"<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/04/AR2010060404806.html Turkey's Erdogan bears responsibility in flotilla fiasco]</ref> . 

''[[USA Today]]'' said "In practical terms, the argument hardly matters. By opting for an assault on the six-ship convoy trying to break a 3-year-old blockade of Gaza, Israel handed its opponents a victory they could not have achieved by other means and simultaneously left itself, the United States and the struggling Mideast peace process with a huge problem....Israel, however, remained adamant, implausibly casting the flotilla organizers as a mortal threat." They drew parallels saying "The pity is that the Israelis so lacked the same prescience, remarkable in light of their own history. No event was more important to the formation of Israel than the confrontation 63 years ago between the ship Exodus..." They believed that as a "smart solution to the current impasse...Israel should allow humanitarian aid into Gaza on the condition that cargo first be inspected for weapons. Palestinians should accept that restriction. The United States and United Nations should try to ensure its enforcement."<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2010-06-02-editorial02_ST_N.htm Our view on battle in the Middle East: Israel's assault on flotilla hands its enemies a victory]</ref> .

The [[Toronto Sun]] said the attack damaged Israel's reputation and suggested it "might have wanted to rethink the orders that led to Monday's fatal clash." It reasoned that this, along with the [[Assassination of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh|Dubai assassination]] of a Hamas leader, "left a trail of evidence a mile wide, to put a dent in the reputation of the country’s legendary intelligence and security operations. " Adding that "For the [[Middle East peace process|peace process]], this story feels relevant in ways that may not be obvious right away, as though something has shifted. It’s not as simple as Israel stumbling into a PR disaster or lost international support, as some would like to make it." However, it also said that "For the Palestinians, it underscored the division between blockaded, Hamas-run Gaza and the West Bank, which has fared better in so many ways for not being Hamas-run Gaza."<ref>{{cite web|last=Van |first=Lisa |url=http://www.torontosun.com/comment/columnists/lisa_vandusen/2010/06/01/14218641.html |title=Flotilla attack dents Israel's reputation &#124; Lisa Van Dusen &#124; Columnists &#124; Comment |publisher=Toronto Sun |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}</ref> .

''[[The Times]]'' published an article by [[José Maria Aznar]], former prime minister of Spain, saying the world must support Israel because "if it goes down, we all go down". He said that "In an ideal world, the assault by Israeli commandos on the 'Mavi Marmara' would not have ended up with nine dead and a score wounded. In an ideal world, the soldiers would have been peacefully welcomed on to the ship." In the article Aznar criticizes Turkey, for placing Israel "in an impossible situation" in which it would have to either give up its security or face world condemnation. Aznar concluded that Israel is the West's first line of defense, and must be protected. <ref>{{cite news|title=Ex-Spain PM: If Israel goes down, we all go down|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3906657,00.html|accessdate=20 June 2010|newspaper=Ynet}}</ref> . 

The [[Financial Times]] called the attack a "brazen act of piracy," that dealt a blow to the legitimacy of Israel's struggle. The paper continued that "Israel claims the activists had links with extremist groups and that some attacked Israeli soldiers with knives and sticks (and in some accounts the odd light firearm). Even if true, this would not justify the illegal capture of civilian ships carrying humanitarian aid in international waters, let alone the use of deadly force."<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cab86fe0-6cde-11df-91c8-00144feab49a.html Israel is lost at sea (Financial Times, May 31, 2010)]</ref> . 

[[Günther Nonnenmacher]] of the editorial board of the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' wrote that Israel seems to have lost all sense of proportion and would not pay attention to public opinion.

The Croatian daily [[Jutarnji List]] said Croatia was in an unenviable position because "On the one hand, the country feels responsibility towards Israel and its politics have always reflected that responsibility. On the other hand, Turkey is an important ally in the region with its influence on the reform processes in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and as a growing trading partner for Croatia."<ref name="crtimes"/> .

A survey of Israeli Jews published in the [[Maariv]] on June 2 showed 94.8 percent agreeing that it was necessary to stop the boats, with 62.7 percent saying it should have been handled in a different manner. Only 8.1 percent thought Netanyahu should resign.

Israeli media, which had initially supported the IDF action and corroborated the IDF account of the incident, later criticized the operation as having been badly handled.

The Brazilian film maker [[Iara Lee]] wrote about her experience on the ship in an article in the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' in which she said "Israel's powerful navy could have easily approached our boat and boarded it in broad daylight or pursued nonviolent options for disabling our vessel. Instead, the Israeli military launched a nighttime assault with heavily armed commandos...I feared for the lives of my fellow passengers as I heard shots being fired on deck, and I later saw the bodies of several people killed being carried inside...When it was over, the Israeli soldiers commandeered our ships, illegally kidnapped us from international waters, towed us to the port of Ashdod, and arrested all of us on board." Concluding that "
What happened to our flotilla is happening to the people of Gaza on a daily basis.

===United Nations Security Council===. 
The [[United Nations Security Council]] convened an emergency meeting at the request of [[Turkey]], during which the [[Ahmet Davutoglu|Turkish foreign minister]] stated "Israel must be held accountable for its crimes" (prior to the meeting, the [[Riyad Mansour|Palestinian ambassador to the UN]] called for an independent Security Council investigation).  While the [[Mark Lyall Grant|British ambassador]] said Israel should end the Gaza blockade and take steps for an investigation, the [[Alejandro Wolff|US deputy permanent representative]] supported the Israeli position that humanitarian aid should have gone by "accepted international mechanisms," and the [[Daniel Carmon|Israeli deputy permanent representative]] said the flotilla was not humanitarian but had a mission of breaking the blockade. <ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/05/31/un.security.council.gaza/index.html?hpt=T1 U.N.
