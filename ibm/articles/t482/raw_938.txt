[[Tobacco control]] is a field of public health science, policy and practice dedicated to controlling (i.e. restricting) the growth of tobacco use and thereby reducing the morbidity and mortality it causes. References to a tobacco control ''movement''  may have either positive or pejorative connotations, both briefly covered here.  . 

==Positive connotations==. 
The tobacco control field comprises the activity of disparate health, policy and legal research and reform advocacy bodies across the world.  These took time to coalesce into a sufficiently organised coalition to advance such measures as the [[World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]], and the first article of the first edition of the ''Tobacco Control'' journal suggested that developing as a diffusely organised movement was indeed necessary in order to bring about effective action to address the health effects of tobacco use. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Ronald|date=March 1992|title=The slow growth of a movement|journal=[[Tobacco Control]]|volume=1|issue=1|url=http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/1/1/1.full.pdf|accessdate=2011-10-04}}</ref> . 

==Pejorative connotations==. 
In some internal [[tobacco industry]] memoranda, the tobacco control field has been pejoratively referred to as the ''anti-smoking movement'' to describe organised threats to their business interests and to denigrate public health concerns. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://tobaccodocuments.org/pm/2503001914-1927.html|title=The Anti-Smoking Movement in Global Perspective|author=P.L.
