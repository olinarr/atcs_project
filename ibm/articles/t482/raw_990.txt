A '''cigar''' is a tightly-rolled bundle of dried and fermented [[tobacco]] that is ignited so that its smoke may be drawn into the mouth. Cigar tobacco is grown in significant quantities in [[Brazil]], [[Cameroon]], [[Cuba]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Honduras]], [[Indonesia]], [[Mexico]], [[Nicaragua]], the [[Philippines]], and the [[Eastern United States]].  . 

== Etymology ==. 
The word "cigar" originated from ''sikar'', the [[Yucatec Mayan]] word for smoking, which became ''cigarro'' in Spanish, probably from the Mayan ''sikar'' ("to smoke rolled tobacco leaves" &ndash; from ''sik'', "tobacco;") or from the Spanish word ''cigarra'' ("grasshopper"). However, the word itself, and variations on it, did not come into general use until 1730. New names for cigars include "Jules", "Havana", "Vitole" and "Puro". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=cigar&searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-25}}</ref> . 

== History ==. 
Explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] is generally credited with the introduction of tobacco to Europe. Two of Columbus's crewmen during his 1492 journey, [[Rodrigo de Jerez]] and [[Luis de Torres]], are said to have encountered tobacco for the first time on the island of [[Hispaniola]], when natives presented them with dry leaves that spread a peculiar fragrance. Tobacco was widely diffused among all of the islands of the Caribbean and therefore they again encountered it in Cuba where Columbus and his men had settled. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Van Lancker JL |title=Smoking and disease |journal=NIDA Res Monogr |issue=17 |pages=230–88 |year=1977 |pmid=417256 |url=http://nida.nih.gov/pdf/monographs/17.pdf#page=243 |format=PDF }}</ref> His sailors reported that the [[Taínos]] on the island of Cuba smoked a primitive form of cigar, with twisted, dried tobacco leaves rolled in other leaves such as palm or plantain.  . 

In due course, Spanish and other European sailors caught the habit, as did the [[Conquistador]]s, and smoking spread to Spain and Portugal and eventually France, most probably through [[Jean Nicot]], the French ambassador to Portugal, who gave his name to [[nicotine]]. Later, the habit spread to Italy and, after Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]'s voyages to the Americas, to Britain. Smoking became familiar throughout Europe—in pipes in Britain—by the mid-16th century and, half a century later, tobacco started to be grown commercially in America. Tobacco was originally thought to have medicinal qualities, but there were some who considered it evil. It was denounced by [[Philip II of Spain]], and [[James I of England]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cigars-review.org/history.htm|title=A bit of History|publisher=Cigars Review|accessdate=8 April 2011}}</ref> . 

Around 1592, the Spanish [[galleon]] ''San Clemente'' brought 50 kilograms (110&nbsp;lb) of tobacco seed to the Philippines over the Acapulco-Manila trade route. The seed was then distributed among the Roman Catholic missionaries, where the clerics found excellent climates and soils for growing high-quality tobacco on Philippine soil.  . 

In the 19th century, cigar smoking was common, while [[cigarette]]s were still comparatively rare. In the early 20th century, [[Rudyard Kipling]] wrote his famous smoking poem, "[[The Betrothed (Kipling poem)|The Betrothed]]." The cigar business was an important industry, and factories employed many people before mechanized manufacturing of cigars became practical. 
[[Image:Ybor Cigar workers.jpg|thumb|Inside an Ybor City cigar factory c. 1920]]
In 1869, Spanish cigar manufacturer [[Vicente Martinez Ybor]] moved his ''Principe de Gales'' (Prince of Wales) operations from the important cigar manufacturing center of [[Havana, Cuba]] to [[Key West, Florida]] to escape the turmoil of the [[Ten Years' War]]. Other manufacturers followed, and Key West became another important cigar manufacturing center. In 1885, Ybor moved again, buying land near the then-small city of [[Tampa, Florida]] and building the largest cigar factory in the world at the time<ref>[http://www.floridastateparks.org/history/parkhistory.cfm?parkid=142 Ybor City Museum State Park]</ref> in the new [[company town]] of [[History of Ybor City|Ybor City]]. Friendly rival and ''Flor de Sánchez y Haya'' owner Ignacio Haya built his own factory nearby in the same year, and many other cigar manufacturers soon followed, especially after an 1886 fire that gutted much of Key West. Thousands of [[Cuban-American|Cuban]] and [[Spanish-American|Spanish]] ''tabaqueros'' came to the area from Key West, Cuba and New York to produce hundreds of millions of cigars annually. Local output peaked in 1929, when workers in Ybor City and [[West Tampa]] rolled over 500,000,000 "clear Havana" cigars, earning the town the nickname "Cigar Capital of the World". <ref name=Frank/><ref>{{cite book | last = Ingalls | first = Robert | title = Tampa Cigar Workers: A Pictorial History | publisher = University Press of Florida | location = Gainesville, Florida | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-8130-2602-4 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite video  | people = Jamison, Gayla (Producer, Director, Writer)  | title = Living in America: 100 Years of Ybor City  | medium = video documentary  | publisher = Lightfoot Films, Inc.  | location = Tampa, Fl  | date = 1987}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | ref=harv  | last = Lastra | first = Frank | title = Ybor City: The Making of a Landmark Town | publisher = University of Tampa Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-59732-003-X }}</ref> . 

In New York, cigars were made by rollers working in their own homes. It was reported that as of 1883, cigars were being manufactured in 127 apartment houses in New York, employing 1,962 families and 7,924 individuals. A state statute banning the practice, passed late that year at the urging of trade unions on the basis that the practice suppressed wages, was ruled unconstitutional less than four months later. The industry, which had relocated to [[Brooklyn]] and other places on [[Long Island]] while the law was in effect, then returned to New York. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9F0CE7DF1238E033A25753C3A9679C94659FD7CF |title="Tenement cigar making", '&#39;New York Times'&#39; (January 30, 1884) |publisher=New York Times |date= |accessdate=2010-10-25}}</ref> . 

As of 1905, there were 80,000 cigar-making operations in the United States, most of them small, family-operated shops where cigars were rolled and sold immediately. <ref name=Frank>{{cite web|url=http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Archives/CA_Show_Article/0,2322,803,00.html |title=Frank, Michael "Wise old hands", '&#39;Cigar Aficionado'&#39; (Winter 1993) |publisher=Cigaraficionado.com |date=1993-12-01 |accessdate=2010-10-25}}</ref> While most cigars are now made by machine, some, as a matter of prestige and quality, are still rolled by hand. This is especially true in Central America and Cuba, as well as in small ''chinchales'' found in virtually every sizable city in the United States. <ref name=Frank/>  Boxes of hand-rolled cigars bear the phrase ''totalmente a mano'' (totally by hand) or ''hecho a mano'' (made by hand).  . 

=== Historical figures ===. 
[[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] enjoyed smoking cigarettes and cigars, much to the chagrin of his mother, [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. After her death, legend has it, King Edward said to his male guests at the end of a dinner party, "Gentlemen, you may smoke." In his name, a line of inexpensive American cigars has long been named King Edward.  . 

U.S. President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] smoked cigars heavily, an estimated up to 12 a day. In late 1884, Grant was diagnosed with an [[oral cancer]] consisting of malignant [[squamous cell carcinoma]]. With his health failing, Grant devoted his time to his autobiography; five days after finishing it, he became the only U.S. president to die of cancer. <!--ref name=Hafner--> . 

[[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[Psychoanalysis]], smoked 20 cigars a day, despite health warnings from colleagues. <ref name=Hafner>{{cite journal |author= Hafner JW, Sturgis EM |title= The famous faces with oral cavity and pharyngeal cancer |journal= Tex Dent J |volume=125 |issue=5 |pages=410–29 |year=2008 |pmid=18561797 |url=http://doep.org/ODU2008.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-06-05}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Because of his frequent references to [[phallic]] symbolism, it is often claimed that his colleagues challenged him on the "phallic" shape of the cigar. Freud is supposed to have replied "sometimes a cigar is just a cigar," however, there are no records of such a conversation ever having taken place. <ref>Attributed in Bartlett, ''Familiar Quotations'' 15th Ed. 679</ref> Initially concealing a cancerous growth in his mouth in 1923, Freud was eventually diagnosed with the same cancer as Grant's. Despite over 30 surgeries, and complications ranging from intense pain to insects infesting dead skin cells around the cancer, Freud smoked cigars until his life ended. Freud died at age 83 in a morphine-induced [[coma]] to relieve the pain from his cancer. <ref name=Hafner/> . 

[[Winston Churchill]], who has been credited with the practice of dunking a cigar in [[port wine]] or [[brandy]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onlinehavanacigars.com/pages/cigarTips.htm |title= Cigar Tips |author=Online Havana Cigars|year=2008 |accessdate=2008-12-09}}</ref> was rarely seen without a cigar during his time as Britain's wartime leader, so much so that a large cigar size was named in his honour.  . 

[[Fidel Castro]] and his [[comrade]] [[Che Guevera]] were often seen smoking a cigar during the early days of the [[Cuban Revolution]]. But Castro has claimed to have given up smoking in the early 1980s as part of a campaign to encourage the Cuban population to smoke less on health grounds. <ref>{{cite book |chapter= Tobacco in the ''Contrapunteo'': Ortiz and the Havana cigar |author= Stubbs J | title= Cuban Counterpoints: the Legacy of Fernando Ortiz |editor= Font MA, Quiroz AW (eds.) |publisher=Lexington |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-7391-0968-7 |pages=105–24}}</ref> Many other celebrities were well-known cigar smokers, including [[Groucho Marx]], [[George Burns]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Jack Benny]], [[Milton Berle]], [[Rush Limbaugh]], [[Ernie Kovacs]] and [[Bill Cosby]]. <ref>{{cite journal |journal=Cigar Aficionado |date= Nov/Dec 1999 |url=http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Archives/CA_Show_Article/0,2322,1140,00.html |title= The top 100 cigar smokers of the twentieth century}}</ref> . 

Rudyard Kipling said in his poem "[[Wikisource:The Betrothed (Kipling)|The Betrothed]]", "And a woman is only a woman, but a good cigar is a smoke." . 

Apart from certain forms of heavily cured and strong [[snuff (tobacco)|snuff]], the cigar is the most potent form of self-dosing with tobacco, it has long had associations of being a male rite of passage, as it may have had during the pre-Columbian era in America. Its fumes and rituals have in American and European cultures established a "men's hut"; in the 19th century, men would retire to the "smoking room" after dinner to discuss serious issues.  . 

== Manufacture ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Reader]] -->
[[File:CigarMakersPR.jpg|thumb|left|Cigar makers in [[Puerto Rico]], circa 1942]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}} . 

Tobacco leaves are harvested and aged using a process that combines use of heat and shade to reduce sugar and water content without causing the large leaves to rot. This first part of the process, called [[curing of tobacco|curing]], takes between 25 and 45 days and varies substantially based upon climatic conditions as well as the construction of sheds or barns used to store harvested tobacco. The curing process is manipulated based upon the type of tobacco, and the desired color of the leaf. The second part of the process, called [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]], is carried out under conditions designed to help the leaf dry slowly. Temperature and humidity are controlled to ensure that the leaf continues to ferment, without rotting or disintegrating. This is where the flavor, burning, and aroma characteristics are primarily brought out in the leaf. 
[[File:Cigar factory. Boys in foreground. Indianapolis, Ind. - NARA - 523076.jpg|thumb|Cigar factory, [[Indianapolis]], Indiana, 1908]]
Once the leaves have aged properly, they are sorted for use as filler or wrapper based upon their appearance and overall quality. During this process, the leaves are continually moistened and handled carefully to ensure each leaf is best used according to its individual qualities. The leaf will continue to be baled, inspected, un-baled, re-inspected, and baled again repeatedly as it continues its aging cycle. When the leaf has matured according to the manufacturer's specifications, it will be used in the production of a cigar.  . 

Quality cigars are still hand-made. An experienced cigar-roller can produce hundreds of very good, nearly identical, cigars per day. The rollers keep the tobacco moist — especially the wrapper — and use specially designed crescent-shaped knives, called ''chavetas'', to form the filler and wrapper leaves quickly and accurately. Once rolled, the cigars are stored in wooden forms as they dry, in which their uncapped ends are cut to a uniform size. From this stage, the cigar is a complete product that can be "laid down" and aged for decades if kept as close to 21°C (70°F), and 70% [[relative humidity]], as the environment will allow. Once cigars have been purchased, proper storage is usually accomplished by keeping the cigars in a specialized wooden box, or [[humidor]], where conditions can be carefully controlled for long periods of time. Even if a cigar becomes dry, it can be successfully re-humidified so long as it has not been handled carelessly and done so gradually. The loss of original tobacco oils, however, will greatly affect the taste.  . 

Some cigars, especially premium brands, use different varieties of tobacco for the filler and the wrapper. '''Long filler cigars''' are a far higher quality of cigar, using long leaves throughout. These cigars also use a third variety of tobacco leaf, called a "binder", between the filler and the outer wrapper. This permits the makers to use more delicate and attractive leaves as a wrapper. These high-quality cigars almost always blend varieties of tobacco. Even Cuban long-filler cigars will combine tobaccos from different parts of the island to incorporate several different flavors.  . 

In '''low-grade''' and '''machine-made cigars''', chopped tobacco leaves are used for the filler, and long leaves or a type of "paper" made from tobacco pulp is used for the wrapper which binds the cigar together. This alters the burning characteristics of the cigar, causing hand-made cigars to be sought-after.  . 

Historically, a ''lector'' or reader was always employed to entertain cigar factory workers. This practice became obsolete once [[audio book]]s for portable music players became available, but it is still practiced in some Cuban factories. The name for the [[Montecristo (cigar brand)|Montecristo cigar brand]] may have arisen from this practice.  . 

=== Dominant manufacturers ===. 
Two firms dominate the cigar industry. [[Altadis]], the world's largest cigar producer, produces cigars in the United States, the Dominican Republic, and Honduras, and has a 50% stake in Corporación Habanos in Cuba. It also makes cigarettes. [[Swedish Match]], the second largest producer, produces cigars in Honduras, Belgium, Germany, Indonesia, the United States, and the Dominican Republic; it also makes [[Chewing tobacco|chewing]] and pipe tobacco, [[snuff]], [[lighter]]s, and [[matches]]. <ref name=Rarick/> . 

=== Families in the cigar industry ===. 
{{Importance-section|date=August 2010}} . 

Nearly all modern cigar makers are members of long-established cigar families, or purport to be [http://www.skydancercigarettes.com/] The art and skill of hand-making premium cigars has been passed from generation to generation; families are often shown in many cigar advertisements and packaging <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Profiles/Cigar_Stars_Profile/0,2547,138,00.html |title=The Change at C.A.O. &#124; Cigar Stars |publisher=Cigar Aficionado |date=2004-04-01 |accessdate=2010-10-25}}</ref> .

Perhaps the best-known cigar family in the world is the [[Arturo Fuente (cigar brand)|Arturo Fuente]] family. Now led by father and son Carlos Fuente, Sr. and Jr. The Fuente family has been rolling their Arturo Fuente and Montesino cigars since 1912.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The release of the Fuente Fuente OpusX in 1995 heralded the first quality wrapper grown in the Dominican Republic.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The oldest Dominican Republic cigar maker is the León family, who have been making their León Jimenes and La Aurora cigars on the island since 1905.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} . 

Not only are premium cigar-makers typically families, but so are those who grow the premium cigar tobacco.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The Oliva family has been growing cigar tobacco since 1934 and their family's tobacco is found in nearly every major cigar brand sold on the US market.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Some families, such as the well-known Padrons, have crossed over from tobacco growing to cigar making.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} While the Padron family has been growing tobacco since the 1850s, they began making cigars that bear their family's name in 1964.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Like the Padrons, the Carlos Torano family first began growing tobacco in 1916 before they started rolling their own family's brands, which also bear the family name, in the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} . 

Families are such an important part of the premium cigar industry that the term "cigar family" is a registered trademark of the Arturo Fuente and J.C. Newman families, used to distinguish and identify their families, premium cigar brands, and charitable foundation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Even the premium cigars made by the cigar industry's two corporate conglomerates, Altadis and Swedish Match, are overseen by members of two cigar families, Altadis' Benjamin Menendez and Swedish Match's [[Ernesto Perez-Carrillo]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} . 

== Marketing and distribution == . 

Cigars are marketed via advertisements, [[product placement]] in movies and other media, sporting events, cigar-friendly magazines such as ''[[Cigar Aficionado]]'', and cigar dinners. Advertisements often include depictions of [[affluence]], sexual imagery, and explicit or implied [[celebrity endorsement]]. <ref name=Baker>{{cite journal |journal=JAMA |year=2000 |volume=284 |issue=6 |pages=735–40 |title= Health risks associated with cigar smoking |author= Baker F, Ainsworth SR, Dye JT ''et al.'' |pmid=10927783 |doi=10.1001/jama.284.6.735}}</ref> . 

''Cigar Aficionado'', launched in 1992, was credited both by cigar companies and readers in transforming the U.S. cigar smoking market from a small [[blue-collar]] segment to an upscale market promoted in places like luxury hotels and golf courses. The magazine presents cigars as symbols of a successful lifestyle, and is a major conduit of advertisements that do not conform to the tobacco industry's voluntary advertisement restrictions since 1965, such as a restriction not to associate smoking with glamour. The magazine also systematically presents pro-smoking arguments at length, arguing that cigars are safer than cigarettes, that life is dangerous anyway, that (contrary to the evidence discussed in ''[[#Heatlh effects|Health effects]]'') cigar smoking has health benefits, that moderation eliminates most or all health risk, that cigar smokers live to old age, that health research is flawed, and that strategically selected health-research results support claims of safety. <ref>{{cite journal |author= DeSantis AD, Morgan SE |title=Sometimes a cigar [magazine] is more than just a cigar [magazine]: pro-smoking arguments in ''Cigar Aficionado'', 1992–2000 |journal= Health Commun |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=457–80 |year=2003 |pmid=14557079 |doi=10.1207/S15327027HC1504_05}}</ref> Like its competitor ''Smoke'', ''Cigar Aficionado'' differs from marketing vehicles used for other tobacco products in that it makes cigars the focus of the entire magazine, creating a symbiosis between product and lifestyle. <ref>{{cite journal |author= Wenger LD, Malone RE, George A, Bero LA |title= Cigar magazines: using tobacco to sell a lifestyle |journal= Tob Control |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=279–84 |year=2001 |pmid=11544394 |pmc=1747592 |doi=10.1136/tc.10.3.279}}</ref> . 

[[File:Flor de Baltimore.jpg|thumb|Cigar delivery truck, [[Salt Lake City]], 1913]]
In the U.S., cigars are exempt from many of the marketing regulations that govern cigarettes. For example, the [[Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act]] of 1970 exempted cigars from its advertising ban,<ref name=Delnevo/> and cigar ads, unlike cigarette ads, need not mention health risks. <ref name=Baker/> As of 2007, cigars were taxed far less than cigarettes, so much so that in many U.S. states, a pack of [[#Little cigars|little cigars]] cost less than half as much as a pack of cigarettes. <ref name=Delnevo/> It is illegal for minors to purchase cigars and other tobacco products in the U.S., but laws are unevenly enforced: a 2000 study found that three-quarters of Internet cigar marketing sites allowed minors to purchase cigars. <ref name=Malone>{{cite journal |journal= Am J Public Health |year=2000 |volume=90 |issue=5 |pages=790–2 |title= Cigars, youth, and the Internet link |author= Malone RE, Bero LA |pmid=10800432 |url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/reprint/90/5/790.pdf |format=PDF |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.90.5.790 |pmc= 1446234}}</ref> . 

Inexpensive cigars are sold in [[convenience store]]s, grocery stores, and pharmacies, mostly as [[self-serve]] items.

== Composition ==. 
Cigars are composed of three types of tobacco leaves, whose variations determine smoking and flavor characteristics: . 

=== Wrappers ===. 
A cigar's outermost leaves, or wrapper, come from the widest part of the plant. The wrapper determines much of the cigar's character and flavor, and as such its color is often used to describe the cigar as a whole. Over 100 wrapper shades are identified by manufacturers, but the seven most common classifications are as follows, from lightest to darkest:<ref>Perelman, Richard, ''Perelman's Pocket Cyclopedia of Cigars'' Perelman, Pioneer & Co.

In general, dark wrappers add a touch of sweetness, while light ones add a hint of dryness to the taste.  . 

=== Fillers ===. 
The majority of a cigar is made up of ''fillers'', wrapped-up bunches of leaves inside the wrapper. Fillers of various strengths are usually blended to produce desired cigar flavors. In the cigar industry this is referred to as a "blend". Many cigar manufacturers pride themselves in constructing the perfect blend(s) that will give the smoker the most enjoyment. The more oils present in the tobacco leaf, the stronger (less dry) the filler. Types range from the minimally flavored Volado taken from the bottom of the plant, through the light-flavored Seco (dry) taken from the middle of the plant, to the strong Ligero from the upper leaves exposed to the most sunlight. Fatter cigars of larger [[#Size and shape|gauge]] hold more filler, with greater potential to provide a full body and complex flavor. However, this effect can be diminished because of the generally poorer burn characteristics of thicker cigars (greater than 50 ring gauge), and the fact that these cigars burn cooler. This can prevent the full spectrum of flavors from being easily detectable. When used, Ligero is always folded into the middle of the filler because it burns slowly.  . 

Fillers can be either long or short; long filler uses whole leaves and is of a better quality, while short filler, also called "mixed", uses chopped leaves, stems, and other bits. Recently some manufacturers have created what they term "medium filler" cigars. They use larger pieces of leaf than short filler without stems, and are of better quality than short filler cigars. Short filler cigars are easy to identify when smoked since they often burn hotter and tend to release bits of leaf into the smoker's mouth. Long filled cigars of high quality should burn evenly and consistently. Also available is a filler called "sandwich" (sometimes "Cuban sandwich") which is a cigar made by rolling short leaf inside long outer leaf. If a cigar is completely constructed (filler, binder and wrapper) of tobacco from only one country, it is referred to in the cigar industry as a "puro" which in Spanish means "pure." . 

=== Binders ===. 
Binders are elastic leaves used to hold together the bunches of fillers. Essentially, binders are wrappers that are rejected because of holes, blemishes, discoloration, or excess veins.  . 

== Size and shape ==.

[[File:Largest cigar.jpg|thumb|World's largest cigar at the Tobacco and Matchstick Museum in [[Skansen]], Stockholm, Sweden.]]
Cigars are commonly categorized by the size and shape of the cigar, which together are known as the ''vitola''.  . 

The size of a cigar is measured by two dimensions: its ring gauge (its diameter in sixty-fourths of an inch) and its length (in inches).In Cuba next to Havana there is a display of the '''world's''' longest rolled cigars.  . 

=== Parejo ===. 
The most common shape is the ''parejo'', sometimes referred to as simply "coronas", which have traditionally been the benchmark against which all other cigar formats are measured. They have a cylindrical body, straight sides, one end open, and a round tobacco-leaf "cap" on the other end which must be sliced off, have a V-shaped notch made in it with a special cutter, or punched through before smoking.  . 

''Parejos'' are designated by the following terms: .

[[File:Cigarshapes1.svg|thumb|Cigar shapes]]
[[File:ToscanoClassico (orizzontale).jpg|thumb|Tuscan cigar]]
Irregularly shaped cigars are known as ''figurados'' and are sometimes considered of higher quality because they are more difficult to make.  . 

Historically, especially during the 19th century, ''figurados'' were the most popular shapes; however, by the 1930s they had fallen out of fashion and all but disappeared. 
They have, however, recently received a small resurgence in popularity, and there are currently many brands (manufacturers) that produce ''figurados'' alongside the simpler ''parejos''. The Cuban cigar brand [[Cuaba (cigar brand)|Cuaba]] only has ''figurados'' in their range.  . 

''Figurados'' include the following:
{| class="wikitable"

|The typical Italian cigar, created in the early 19th century when Kentucky tobacco was hybridized with local varieties and used to create a long, tough, slim cigar thicker in the middle and tapered at the ends, with a very strong aroma. It is also known as a [[cheroot]], which is the largest selling cigar shape in the United States. 
|} . 

Arturo Fuente, a large cigar manufacturer based in the Dominican Republic, has also manufactured figurados in exotic shapes ranging from chilli peppers to baseball bats and American footballs. They are highly collectible and extremely expensive, when publicly available. In practice, the terms Torpedo and Pyramid are often used interchangeably, even among very knowledgeable cigar smokers. Min Ron Nee, the Hong Kong-based cigar expert whose work ''An Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Post-Revolution Havana Cigars'' is considered to be the definitive work on cigars and cigar terms, defines Torpedo as "cigar slang". Nee thinks the majority is right (because slang is defined by majority usage) and torpedoes are pyramids by another name.  . 

=== Little cigars ===. 
Little cigars (sometimes called ''small cigars'' or ''miniatures'' in the UK) differ greatly from regular cigars. They weigh less than cigars and [[cigarillo]]s,<ref>{{cite book |title= Cigars: Health Effects and Trends |editor= Shopland DR, Burns DM, Hoffman D, Cummings KM, Amacher RH (eds.) |author= Connolly GN |chapter= Policies regulating cigars |chapterurl=http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/tcrb/monographs/9/m9_8.PDF |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-03-15 |publisher= National Cancer Institute |series= Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph No. 9 |year=1998 |pages=221–32}}</ref> but, more importantly, they resemble cigarettes in size, shape, packaging, and filters. <ref name=smokers-choice/> Sales of little cigars quadrupled in the U.S. from 1971 to 1973 in response to the [[Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act]], which banned the broadcast of cigarette advertisements and required stronger health warnings on cigarette packs. Cigars were exempt from the ban, and perhaps more importantly, were [[#Marketing and distribution|taxed]] at a far lower rate. Little cigars are sometimes called "cigarettes in disguise", and unsuccessful attempts have been made to reclassify them as cigarettes. In the United States, sales of little cigars reached an all-time high in 2006, fueled in great part by their taxation loophole. <ref name=Delnevo>{{cite journal

== Smoking ==. 
[[File:H.Upmann Coronas Major.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A double guillotine-style cutter, used for cutting the tip of a cigar, next to two hand-rolled [[H. Upmann]] ''Coronas Major'' cigars, one inside its storage tube and one outside. The "Made in Cuba" label (see "Cuban cigars" section) is visible on the lower tube.]]
To smoke a cigar, a smoker cuts the closed end or 'cap', lights the other end, then puts the unlit end into the mouth and draws smoke into the mouth. Some smokers inhale the smoke into the lungs, particularly with [[#Little cigars|little cigars]], but this is uncommon otherwise. A smoker may swirl the smoke around in the mouth before exhaling it, and may exhale part of the smoke through the nose in order to smell the cigar better as well as to taste it.  . 

=== Cutting ===. 
{{Main|Cigar cutter}}
Although some cigars are cut on both ends, or twirled at both ends, the vast majority come with one straight cut end and one end in a "cap". Most quality handmade cigars, regardless of shape, will have a cap which is one or more small pieces of a wrapper pasted on to one end of the cigar with either a natural tobacco paste or with a mixture of flour and water. The cap end of a cigar must be cut off for the cigar to be smoked properly. It is the rounded end without the tobacco exposed, and this is the end one should always cut. If the cap is cut jaggedly or without care, the end of the cigar will not burn evenly and smokeable tobacco will be lost. Some cigar manufacturers purposely place different types of tobacco from one end to the other to give the cigar smokers a variety of tastes, body and strength from start to finish. Smoking a cigar from the wrong end may result in a bad experience.  . 

There are three basic types of cigar cutters: . 

*Guillotine (straight cut)
*Punch cut
*V-cut (a.k.a. notch cut, cat's eye, wedge cut, English cut) . 

=== Lighting ===. 
The "head" of the cigar is usually the end closest to the [[cigar band]]. The opposite end of the cigar is called the "foot". The band identifies the type of the cigar and may be removed or left on. The smoker cuts the cap from the head of the cigar and ignites the foot of the cigar. The smoker draws smoke from the head of the cigar with the mouth and lips, usually not inhaling into the lungs.  . 

When lighting, the cigar should be rotated to achieve an even burn and the air should be slowly drawn with gentle puffs.  A flame that may not impart its own flavor to the cigar should be used. The tip of the cigar should minimally touch the flame, the heat of the flame from a butane or torch lighter can burn the tobacco leafs. A match or cedar spill flame is a milder flame to be used.  . 

Cigars can be lit with the use of butane-filled lighters. Butane is colorless, odorless and burns clean with very little, if any, flavor; but are quite hot as a flame source. It is not recommended to use (lighter) fluid-filled lighters and paper matches since they can influence the taste.  . 

A second option is wooden matches but make sure the chemical head of the match has burned away and you are only placing the burning wooden match on your cigar. Depending on the manufacturer the chemical head portion of the matchstick may contain one or more of the following: gelatin, paraffin wax, potassium chlorate, barium chlorate, glue, polyvinyl chlorides, phosphorus trisulfide, and clay.  The strike plate to ignite the match may contain one more of the following: glass particles, red phosphorous and glue. So make sure the head of the match has burned off before approaching your cigar.  . 

A third and most traditional way to light a cigar is to use a cedar spill.  A spill is a splinter or a slender piece of wood or twisted paper, for lighting candles, lamps, campfires or fireplaces, etc.  A cedar spill for lighting a cigar is a torn narrow strip of Spanish cedar (ideally) and lit using whatever flame source is handy. 
<ref name="lighting">[http://www.cigars4dummies.com/cigar-smoking/lighting.html Lighting Cigars Article], Cigars4Dummies, 2009</ref> . 

Cigars packaged in boxes or metal tubes may contain a thin wrapping of cedar that may be used to light a cigar, minimizing the problem of lighters or matches affecting the taste.  Cedar spills, matches and lighters are all commercially available.  . 

=== Flavor === . 

{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}} . 

Each brand and type of cigar tastes different. While the wrapper does not entirely determine the flavor of the cigar, darker wrappers tend to produce a sweetness, while lighter wrappers usually have a "drier" taste. Whether a cigar is mild, medium, or full bodied does not correlate with quality. Some words used to describe cigar flavor and texture include; spicy, peppery (red or black), sweet, harsh, burnt, green, earthy, woody, cocoa, chestnut, roasted, aged, nutty, creamy, cedar, oak, chewy, fruity, and leathery.  . 

Cigar smoke, which is sometimes inhaled, tastes of tobacco with nuances of other tastes. Many different things affect the scent of cigar smoke: tobacco type, quality of the cigar, added flavors, age and humidity, production method (handmade vs. machine-made) and more. A fine cigar can taste completely different from inhaled cigarette smoke. When smoke is inhaled, as is usual with cigarettes, the tobacco flavor is less noticeable than the sensation from the smoke. Some cigar enthusiasts use a vocabulary similar to that of wine-tasters to describe the overtones and undertones observed while smoking a cigar. Journals are available for recording personal ratings, description of flavors observed, sizes, brands, etc. Cigar tasting is in such respects similar to [[wine-tasting|wine]], [[brandy]], [[whisky]], [[tea]], [[coffee]], and [[beer]] tasting.  . 

=== Smoke === . 

Smoke is produced by incomplete combustion of tobacco during which at least three kinds of chemical reactions occur: [[pyrolysis]] breaks down organic molecules into simpler ones, pyrosynthesis recombines these newly formed fragments into chemicals not originally present, and [[distillation]] moves compounds such as nicotine from the tobacco into the smoke. For every gram of tobacco smoked, a cigar emits about 120–140&nbsp;mg of [[carbon dioxide]], 40–60&nbsp;mg of [[carbon monoxide]], 3–4&nbsp;mg of [[isoprene]], 1&nbsp;mg each of [[hydrogen cyanide]] and [[acetaldehyde]], and smaller quantities of a large spectrum of volatile [[Nitrosamines|''N''-nitrosamines]] and [[volatile organic compound]]s, with the detailed composition unknown. <ref>{{cite book |title= Cigars: Health Effects and Trends |editor= Shopland DR, Burns DM, Hoffman D, Cummings KM, Amacher RH (eds.) |author= Hoffmann D, Hoffmann I |chapter= Chemistry and toxicology |chapterurl=http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/tcrb/monographs/9/m9_3.PDF |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-03-15 |publisher= National Cancer Institute |series= Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph No. 9 |year=1998 |pages=55–104}}</ref> . 

The most odorous chemicals in cigar smoke, and arguably the most responsible for the odor, are [[pyridine]]s. Along with [[pyrazine]]s, they are also the most odorous chemicals in cigar smoker's breath. These substances are noticeable even at extremely low concentrations of a few parts per billion. During smoking, it is not known whether these chemicals are generated by [[bond cleavage|splitting the chemical bonds]] of nicotine, or by [[Maillard reaction]] between [[amino acid]]s and sugars in the tobacco. <ref name=Bazemore>{{cite journal |author=Bazemore R, Harrison C, Greenberg M |title=Identification of components responsible for the odor of cigar smoker's breath |journal=J Agric Food Chem |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=497–501 |year=2006 |pmid=16417311 |doi=10.1021/jf0519109}}</ref> . 

Cigar smoke is more [[alkaline]] than cigarette smoke, and therefore dissolves and is absorbed more readily by the [[Oral mucosa|mucous membrane of the mouth]], making it easier for the smoker to absorb nicotine without having to inhale. <ref name=Viegas>{{cite journal |author=Viegas CA |title=Noncigarette forms of tobacco use |journal=J Bras Pneumol |volume=34 |issue=12 |pages=1069–73 |year=2008 |pmid=19180343 |doi=10.1590/S1806-37132008001200013 |url=http://scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1806-37132008001200013&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en }}</ref> . 

== Humidors ==. 
{{main|Humidor}}
The level of [[humidity]] in which cigars are kept has a significant effect on their taste. It is believed that a cigar's flavor best evolves when stored at a relative humidity of approximately 68-74% and a [[temperature]] of 64 °F{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. An ideal rate of humidity allows an even burning of the cigar. Conversely, dry cigars become fragile and burn faster while damp cigars burn unevenly and take on a heavy [[acidic]] flavor. Humidors together with their humidifiers are then used to serve this purpose. Humidor's interior lining is basically constructed with three types of [[wood]]: [[Spanish cedar]], American (or Canadian) red cedar, and Honduran [[mahogany]].  . 

Most humidors come with a plastic or metal case with a [[sponge]] that works as the humidifier, although most recent versions come on polymer acryl. The latter must be filled only with [[distilled water]], and the former may use a solution of [[propylene glycol]] and distilled water. Humidifiers may become contaminated with [[bacteria]] and should be replaced every two years to avoid such contamination.  . 

Humidors also come with [[analog signal|analog]] or [[digital]] [[hygrometer]]s. There are three systems of analog hygrometers: analog hygrometers with a metal spring, analog natural hair hygrometers, and analog synthetic hair hygrometers. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.humidor-guide.com| title=Humidor Guide|date=|accessdate=2010-05-19}}</ref> . 

== Accessories ==. 
There are a wide variety of cigar accessories on the market. Their prices may vary depending on the materials used and the quality of the finishing.  . 

=== Cigar travel cases ===. 
Travel cases are intended to protect cigars from the environmental elements and to avoid the possibility of cigars being crushed. Most travel cases come in expandable or sturdy [[leather]]. They should be thick enough to protect cigars, and the inside should not have a strong leather smell that could affect the cigar's taste. Some of these cases come with either [[Card stock|cardboard]] or metal tubes that add protection and prevent the cigar from becoming permeated with the leather. 
 [[File:Croccigarcase.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A cigar case made of [[crocodile]] skin with sterling silver appointments and bearing a [[Birmingham]] [[hallmark]] for 1904]]
[[Silver]] and [[brass]] cigar travel cases are also available as well as wood cigar cases. The latter can range from affordable cases to handcrafted ones, while the former tend to be quite expensive.  . 

=== Cigar tubes ===. 
Cigar tubes are used to carry small numbers of cigars, typically one or five. The latter tube would be called 5-finger tube and the former 1-finger tube. They are usually made from [[stainless steel]]. Cigar tubes are normally used when one is out for a few hours, but if it is necessary to spend longer periods of time out, there are tubes that come with a built in humidifier and hygrometer.  . 

=== Cigar holders ===. 
Cigar holders are also known as cigar stands and are used to keep the cigars out of ashtrays. Also, cigar holders may refer to a tube in which the cigar is held while smoked. These are mostly used by women, and rarely by men.  .

{{Further|Health effects of tobacco}} . 

Like other forms of tobacco use, cigar smoking poses a significant health risk depending on dosage: risks are greater for those who inhale more when they smoke, smoke more cigars, or smoke them longer. <ref name=Symm/> However, when cigar smokers don’t inhale or smoke few cigars per day, the risks are only slightly above those of never smokers. <ref name=Burns>{{cite book |title= Cigars: Health Effects and Trends |editor= Shopland DR, Burns DM, Hoffman D, Cummings KM, Amacher RH (eds.) |author= Burns DM |chapter= Cigar smoking: overview and current state of the science |chapterurl=http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/tcrb/monographs/9/m9_1.PDF |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-02-23 |publisher= National Cancer Institute |series= Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph No. 9 |year=1998 |page=8}}</ref> The risk of dying from any cause is statistically greater for cigar smokers than for people who have never smoked, with the risk higher for smokers less than 65 years old, and with risk for moderate and deep inhalers reaching levels similar to cigarette smokers. <ref name=Shanks/> However, for those who don't inhale and smoke 1 - 2 cigars per day, the risk of dying from all causes is statistically insignificant when compared to never smokers. <ref name=Burns>{{cite book |title= Cigars: Health Effects and Trends |editor= Shopland DR, Burns DM, Hoffman D, Cummings KM, Amacher RH (eds.) |author= Burns DM |chapter= Cigar smoking: overview and current state of the science |chapterurl=http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/tcrb/monographs/9/m9_1.PDF |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-02-23 |publisher= National Cancer Institute |series= Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph No. 9 |year=1998 |page=6}}</ref> For those who inhale or smoke several cigars a day, types of health risk can be similar to those associated with [[cigarette]] smoking: [[nicotine]] addiction, [[periodontal]] disease, tooth loss, and many types of cancer, including cancers of the [[Oral cancer|mouth]], throat, and [[esophageal cancer|esophagus]]. <ref name=Burns>{{cite book |title= Cigars: Health Effects and Trends |editor= Shopland DR, Burns DM, Hoffman D, Cummings KM, Amacher RH (eds.) |author= Burns DM |chapter= Cigar smoking: overview and current state of the science |chapterurl=http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/tcrb/monographs/9/m9_1.PDF |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-12-02 |publisher= National Cancer Institute |series= Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph No. 9 |year=1998 |pages=1–20}}</ref> Cigar smoking can also cause cancers of the [[Lung cancer|lung]] and [[Laryngeal cancer|larynx]].

== Popularity ==. 
The [[prevalence]] of cigar smoking varies depending on location, historical period, and population surveyed, and prevalence estimates vary somewhat depending on the survey method. The U.S. is the top consuming country by far, followed by Germany and the UK; the U.S. and western Europe account for about 75% of cigar sales worldwide. <ref name=Rarick>{{cite journal |ssrn=1127582 |author= Rarick CA |title= Note on the premium cigar industry |date=2008-04-02 |publisher=SSRN }}</ref> The 2005 U.S. National Health Interview Survey estimated that 2.2% of adults smoke cigars, about the same as smokeless tobacco but far less than the 21% of adults who smoke cigarettes; it also estimated that 4.3% of men but only 0.3% of women smoke cigars. <ref>{{cite journal |journal= MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep |year=2006 |volume=55 |issue=42 |pages=1145–8 |title= Tobacco use among adults—United States, 2005 |author= Mariolis P, Rock VJ, Asman K ''et al.'' |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5542a1.htm |pmid= 17065979}}</ref> The 2002 U.S. National Survey of Drug Use and Health found that adults with serious psychological distress are significantly more likely to smoke cigars than those without. <ref>{{cite journal |journal= Addict Behav |year=2008 |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=582–92 |title= Tobacco use among those with serious psychological distress: results from the national survey of drug use and health, 2002 |author= Hagman BT, Delnevo CD, Hrywna M, Williams JM |doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2007.11.007 |pmid=18158218 |pmc= 2696205}}</ref> A 2007 California study found that gay men and bisexual women smoke significantly fewer cigars than the general population of men and women, respectively. <ref>{{cite journal |journal=Nicotine Tob Res |year=2007 |volume=9 |issue=9 |pages=937–40 |title= Cigar and smokeless tobacco use in the lesbian, gay, and bisexual population |author= Gruskin EP, Greenwood GL, Matevia M, Pollack LM, Bye LL, Albright V |doi=10.1080/14622200701488426 |pmid=17763109}}</ref> Substantial and steady increases in cigar smoking were observed during the 1990s and early 2000s in the U.S. among both adults and adolescents. <ref name=smokers-choice>{{cite journal |journal= Public Health Rep |year=2006 |volume=121 |issue=2 |pages=116–9 |title= Smokers' choice: what explains the steady growth of cigar use in the U.S.? |author= Delnevo CD |pmid=16528942 |url=http://www.publichealthreports.org/userfiles/121_2/121116.pdf |format=PDF |pmc= 1525261}}</ref> Data suggest that cigar usage among young adult males increased threefold during the 1990s, a 1999–2000 survey of 31,107 young adult U.S. military recruits found that 12.3% smoked cigars,<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Addict Behav |year=2008 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=69–82 |title= Prevalence of alternative forms of tobacco use in a population of young adult military recruits |author= Vander Weg MW, Peterson AL, Ebbert JO, Debon M, Klesges RC, Haddock CK |doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2007.07.005 |pmid=17706889 |pmc=2101765}}</ref> and a 2003–2004 survey of 4,486 high school students in a [[Midwestern]] county found that 18% smoked cigars. <ref>{{cite journal |journal= Am J Health Behav |year=2008 |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=640–9 |title= Cigars, cigarettes, and adolescents |author= Brooks A, Gaier Larkin EM, Kishore S, Frank S |pmid=18442343 |url=http://png.publisher.ingentaconnect.com/content/png/ajhb/2008/00000032/00000006/art00008 |doi= 10.5555/ajhb.2008.32.6.640}}</ref> .

Cuban cigars are rolled from tobacco leaves found throughout the country of Cuba. The filler, binder, and wrapper may come from different portions of the island. All cigar production in Cuba is controlled by the Cuban government, and each brand may be rolled in several different factories in Cuba. Cuban cigar rollers or "[[torcedor]]es" are claimed by cigar experts to be the most skilled rollers in the world.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Torcedores are highly respected in Cuban society and culture and travel worldwide displaying their art of hand rolling cigars. <ref name="crollers">{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AC&p_theme=ac&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F338C43ACDEC4B0&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=CUBAN GOLD GETS ROLLED IN VINELAND / STORE OFFERS CIGARS ROLLED BY CUBAN HANDS|last=RIVERA |first= Maricarmen|date=2002-04-29 |publisher=The Press of Atlantic City|accessdate=2009-03-08}}</ref> . 

[[Habanos SA]] and [[Cubatabaco]] between them do all the work relating to Cuban cigars, including [[manufacture]], [[quality control]], promotion and distribution, and export. Cuba produces both handmade and machine made cigars. All boxes and labels are marked ''Hecho en Cuba'' (made in Cuba). Machine-bunched cigars finished by hand add ''Hecho a mano'', while fully hand-made cigars say ''Totalmente a mano'' in script text, though not all Cuban cigars will include this statement. Because of the perceived status of Cuban cigars, counterfeits are somewhat commonplace. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.decaturspirits.com/cigars/fakecubans/ |title=Identifying Counterfeit Cuban Cigars |publisher=Decaturspirits.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-25}}</ref> . 

Despite American trade sanctions against Cuban products, cigars remain one of the country's leading exports. The country exported 77 million cigars in 1991, 67 million in 1992, and 57 million in 1993, the decline attributed to a loss of much of the wrapper crop in a hurricane. <ref>Marvin R.

On February 7, 1962, United States President [[John F. Kennedy]] imposed a [[United States embargo against Cuba|trade embargo on Cuba]] to sanction [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[communist]] government. According to [[Pierre Salinger]], then Kennedy's press secretary, the president ordered him on the evening of February 6 to obtain 1,200 [[H. Upmann (cigar brand)|H. Upmann]] brand [[Winston churchill (cigar)|petit corona]] Cuban cigars; upon Salinger's arrival with the cigars the following morning, Kennedy signed the executive order which put the embargo into effect. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Archives/CA_Show_Article/0,2322,862,00.html |title=Kennedy, Cuba and Cigars |publisher=Cigar Aficionado |date=1992-09-01 |accessdate=2010-10-25}}</ref> Richard Goodwin, a White House assistant to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, revealed in a 2000 ''New York Times'' article that in early 1962 JFK told him, "We tried to exempt cigars, but the cigar manufacturers in Tampa objected."<ref>{{cite news |title= President Kennedy's plan for peace with Cuba |author= Goodwin R |work= New York Times |date=2000-07-05 |accessdate=2008-09-20 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DEFDB1039F936A35754C0A9669C8B63}}</ref> . 

The embargo prohibited US residents from legally purchasing Cuban cigars and American cigar manufacturers from importing Cuban tobacco. As a result, Cuba was deprived of its major customer for tobacco and American cigar manufacturers either had to find an alternative source of tobacco or go out of business. <ref>[http://www.floridamemory.com/PhotographicCollection/photo_exhibits/cigar/cigar5.cfm "Florida Cigars: Artistry, Labor, and Politics in Florida’s Oldest Industry" - Archives of the State of Florida]</ref> . 

In the United States, authentic Cuban-made cigars are seen as "[[forbidden fruit]]" for Americans to purchase.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Upon the expropriation of private property in Cuba, many former Cuban cigar manufacturers moved to other countries (primarily the Dominican Republic) to continue production. <ref name="Gage1997">{{cite book

=== Cigars specific to other countries ===. 
Italy produces the ''sigaro toscano'' ([[Tuscany|Tuscan]] cigar), a dry cigar, very different from the moist Havana style. Tuscan-style cigars are also manufactured in the [[United States of America|United States]], only by The Avanti Cigar Co. of [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]. Their brands include Parodi, De Nobili, Petri, and the anisette-flavored Avanti. <ref>www.avanticigar.com/avarticle.html</ref> . 

The [[cheroot]] is traditionally associated with [[Burma]] and India.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} .

Major U.S. print media portray cigars favorably; they generally frame cigar use as a lucrative business or a trendy habit, rather than as a health risk. <ref>{{cite journal |journal= Am J Public Health |year=2001 |volume=91 |issue=2 |pages=288–91 |title= The cigar revival and the popular press: a content analysis, 1987–1997 |author= Wenger L, Malone R, Bero L |pmid=11211641 |pmc=1446522 |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.91.2.288}}</ref> Rich people are often caricatured as wearing [[top hat]]s and [[tail coat|tails]] and smoking cigars. Cigars are often smoked to celebrate special occasions: the birth of a child, a graduation, a big sale. The [[idiom|expression]] "close but no cigar" comes from the practice of giving cigars as [[prize]]s in games involving good aim at [[funfair|fairground]]s.  .
