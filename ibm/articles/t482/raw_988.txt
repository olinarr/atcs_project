In low concentrations (an average [[cigarette]] yields about 1&nbsp;mg of absorbed nicotine), the substance acts as a [[stimulant]] in [[mammal]]s and is the main factor responsible for the dependence-forming properties of [[tobacco smoking]]. According to the [[American Heart Association]], nicotine [[Substance use disorder|addiction]] has historically been one of the hardest addictions to break, while the pharmacological and behavioral characteristics that determine tobacco addiction are similar to those  determining addiction to  [[heroin]] and [[cocaine]]. The nicotine content of popular American-brand cigarettes has slowly increased over the years, and one study found that there was an average increase of 1.6% per year between the years of 1998 and 2005.

== History and name ==. 
Nicotine is named after the tobacco plant ''[[Nicotiana tabacum]],'' which in turn is named after [[Jean Nicot|Jean Nicot de Villemain]], [[France|French]] ambassador in [[Portugal]], who sent tobacco and seeds from [[Brazil]] to [[Paris]] in 1560 and promoted their medicinal use. Nicotine was first isolated from the tobacco plant in 1828 by physician Wilhelm Heinrich Posselt and chemist Karl Ludwig Reimann of [[Germany]], who considered it a poison. <ref>W. Posselt and L. Reimann (1828) [http://books.google.com/books?id=cgkCAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA138#v=onepage&q&f=false "Chemische Untersuchung des Tabaks und Darstellung eines eigenthümlich wirksamen Prinzips dieser Pflanze"] (Chemical investigation of tobacco and preparation of a characteristically active constituent of this plant), Geiger's ''Magazin für Pharmacie'', volume 6, number 24, pages 138-161. </ref><ref>{{cite journal

== Chemistry ==. 
Nicotine is a [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]], oily liquid that is [[miscible]] with [[water (molecule)|water]] in its [[base (chemistry)|base]] form. As a [[nitrogenous base]], nicotine forms [[salt]]s with [[acid]]s that are usually solid and water soluble. Nicotine easily penetrates the [[skin]]. As shown by the physical data, [[Freebase (chemistry)|free base]] nicotine will burn at a temperature below its boiling point, and its vapors will combust at {{convert|308|K|C F}} in air despite a low [[vapor pressure]].  Because of this, most of the nicotine is burned when a cigarette is smoked; however, enough is inhaled to cause pharmacological effects.  . 

== Optical activity ==. 
Nicotine is [[optically active]], having two [[enantiomer]]ic forms. The naturally occurring form of nicotine is [[levorotatory]] with a [[specific rotation]] of [α]<sub>D</sub> = –166.4° ((&minus;)-nicotine). The [[dextrorotatory]] form, (+)-nicotine is physiologically less active than (–)-nicotine. (&minus;)-nicotine is more toxic than (+)-nicotine. <ref>{{cite book|last=Gause|first=G.

As nicotine enters the body, it is distributed quickly through the [[blood]]stream and crosses the [[blood-brain barrier]] reaching the [[Human brain|brain]] within 10–20 seconds after inhalation. <ref name="Le Houezec-2003">{{Cite journal | last1 = Le Houezec | first1 = J. | title = Role of nicotine pharmacokinetics in nicotine addiction and nicotine replacement therapy: a review | journal = Int J Tuberc Lung Dis | volume = 7 | issue = 9 | pages = 811–9 | month = Sep | year = 2003 | pmid = 12971663 }}</ref> The [[elimination half-life]] of nicotine in the body is around two hours. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Benowitz NL, Jacob P 3rd, Jones RT, Rosenberg J|year=1982|title=Interindividual variability in the metabolism and cardiovascular effects of nicotine in man|journal= J Pharmacol Exp Ther|volume=221|issue=2|pages=368–72|pmid=7077531|first1=NL|last2=Jacob P|first2=3rd|last3=Jones|first3=RT|last4=Rosenberg|first4=J}}</ref> . 

The amount of nicotine absorbed by the body from smoking depends on many factors, including the types of tobacco, whether the smoke is inhaled, and whether a filter is used. For [[chewing tobacco]], [[dipping tobacco]], [[snus]] and [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]], which are held in the mouth between the lip and gum, or taken in the nose, the amount released into the body tends to be much greater than smoked tobacco.{{Clarify|Say how much for each?|date=July 2011}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Nicotine is [[metabolized]] in the [[liver]] by [[cytochrome P450]] enzymes (mostly [[CYP2A6]], and also by [[CYP2B6]]).  A major metabolite is [[cotinine]].  . 

Other primary metabolites include nicotine ''N'''-oxide, nornicotine, nicotine isomethonium ion, 2-hydroxynicotine and nicotine glucuronide. <ref name=hukkanen2005>{{cite journal|last=Hukkanen J, Jacob P 3rd, Benowitz NL. |title=Metabolism and Disposition Kinetics of Nicotine|journal=Pharmacol Rev. |year= 2005 |month= March |volume=57|issue=1|pages=79–115|pmid=15734728|url=http://pharmrev.aspetjournals.org/cgi/content/full/57/1/79|doi=10.1124/pr.57.1.3|first1=J|last2=Jacob P|first2=3rd|last3=Benowitz|first3=NL}}</ref> Under some conditions, other substances may be formed such as [[myosmine]]. <ref>http://chromatographyonline.findanalytichem.com/lcgc/News/The-danger-of-third-hand-smoke/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/713385</ref> .

===Detection of use===. 
==== Medical detection ==== . 

Nicotine can be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or to facilitate a medicolegal death investigation. Urinary or salivary cotinine concentrations are frequently measured for the purposes of pre-employment and health insurance medical screening programs. Careful interpretation of results is important, since passive exposure to cigarette smoke can result in significant accumulation of nicotine, followed by the appearance of its metabolites in various body fluids. <ref>Benowitz NL, Hukkanen J, Jacob P.

===Pharmacodynamics===. 
Nicotine acts on the [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s, specifically the [[ganglion type nicotinic receptor]] and one [[Alpha-4 beta-2 nicotinic receptor|CNS nicotinic receptor]]. The former is present in the [[adrenal medulla]] and elsewhere, while the latter is present in the [[central nervous system]] (CNS). In small concentrations, nicotine increases the activity of these receptors. Nicotine also has effects on a variety of other neurotransmitters through less direct mechanisms.  . 

====In the central nervous system==== . 

[[File:NicotineDopaminergic WP1602.png|thumb|right|Effect of nicotine on dopaminergic neurons]]
By binding to [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s, nicotine increases the levels of several [[neurotransmitter]]s - acting as a sort of "volume control". It is thought that increased levels of [[dopamine]] in the [[reward circuit]]s of the [[Human brain|brain]] are responsible for the apparent [[euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]] and [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]], and addiction caused by nicotine consumption. Nicotine has a higher affinity for [[acetylcholine]] receptors in the brain than those in [[skeletal muscle]], though at toxic doses it can induce contractions and respiratory paralysis. <ref>Katzung, Bertram G. Basic & Clinical Pharmacology (Basic and Clinical Pharmacology). New York: McGraw-Hill Medical, 2006. pages 99-105. </ref> Nicotine's selectivity is thought to be due to a particular amino acid difference on these receptor subtypes. <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Xiu | first1 = Xinan | last2 = Puskar | first2 = Nyssa L. | last3 = Shanata | first3 = Jai A.

Acetylcholine released by preganglionic sympathetic fibers of these nerves acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, causing the release of epinephrine (and norepinephrine) into the [[bloodstream]].

[[File:NicotineChromaffinCells WP1603.png|thumb|right|Effect of nicotine on chromaffin cells]] . 

====In adrenal medulla====. 
By binding to [[ganglion type nicotinic receptor]]s in the adrenal medulla nicotine increases flow of [[adrenaline]] (epinephrine), a stimulating [[hormone]] and neurotransmitter. By binding to the receptors, it causes cell depolarization and an influx of [[calcium]] through voltage-gated calcium channels. Calcium triggers the [[exocytosis]] of [[Chromaffin cell|chromaffin granules]] and thus the release of [[epinephrine]] (and norepinephrine) into the [[bloodstream]]. The release of [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline) causes an increase in [[heart rate]], [[blood pressure]] and [[breathing|respiration]], as well as higher [[blood glucose]] levels. <ref name="Marieb" >{{cite book | author = Elaine N.

Nicotine is the natural product of tobacco, having a half-life of 1 to 2 hours. [[Cotinine]] is an active metabolite of nicotine that remains in the blood for 18 to 20 hours, making it easier to analyze due to its longer half-life. <ref>[http://web.mit.edu/murj/www/v08/v08-Reports/v08-r2.pdf ''Detection of Cotinine in Blood Plasma by HPLC MS/MS''], MIT Undergraduate Research Journal, Volume 8, Spring 2003, Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ref> .

When they wish to relax, they take deep puffs, which produce a high level of blood nicotine, which depresses the passage of [[nerve impulses]], producing a mild sedative effect. At low doses, nicotine potently enhances the actions of [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]] in the brain, causing a drug effect typical of those of [[psychostimulants]]. At higher doses, nicotine enhances the effect of [[serotonin]] and [[opiate]] activity, producing a calming, [[analgesic|pain-killing]] effect.

==Dependence and withdrawal==. 
{{See also|Smoking cessation}}
Modern [[research]] shows that nicotine acts on the brain to produce a number of effects. Specifically, research examining its addictive nature has been found to show that nicotine activates the [[Mesolimbic pathway]] ("reward system") —the circuitry within the brain that regulates feelings of pleasure and euphoria. <ref>[http://www.nida.nih.gov/researchreports/nicotine/nicotine2.html NIDA - Research Report Series - Tobacco Addiction - Extent, Impact, Delivery, and Addictiveness<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . 

[[Dopamine]] is one of the key [[neurotransmitters]] actively involved in the brain. Research shows that by increasing the levels of dopamine within the reward circuits in the brain, nicotine acts as a chemical with intense addictive qualities. In many studies it has been shown to be more addictive than [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]]. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/02/science/is-nicotine-addictive-it-depends-on-whose-criteria-you-use.html | work=The New York Times | first=Philip J. | last=Hilts | title=Is Nicotine Addictive?

As dopamine regulates the sensitivity of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors decreases. To compensate for this compensatory mechanism, the brain in turn upregulates the number of receptors, [[convoluting]] its regulatory effects with compensatory mechanisms meant to counteract other compensatory mechanisms. An example is the increase in [[norepinephrine]], one of the successors to dopamine, which inhibit reuptake of the [[glutamate receptors]],<ref>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WN4-4CCGGN1-9P&_user=10&_coverDate=11%2F30%2F1984&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_origin=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_searchStrId=1520587233&_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=5e43884bdf1f204eb2356e02096708bc&searchtype=a</ref> in charge of memory and cognition. The net effect is an increase in reward pathway sensitivity, the opposite of other addictive drugs such as cocaine and heroin, which reduce reward pathway sensitivity. <ref name=Kenny/> This neuronal brain alteration can persist for months after administration ceases.  . 

A study found that nicotine exposure in adolescent mice retards the growth of the dopamine system, thus increasing the risk of substance abuse during adolescence. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Nolley EP, Kelley BM |title=Adolescent reward system perseveration due to nicotine: studies with methylphenidate |journal=Neurotoxicol Teratol |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=47–56 |year=2007 |pmid=17129706 |doi=10.1016/j.ntt.2006.09.026 }}</ref> . 

===Immunology prevention=== . 

Because of the severe addictions and the harmful effects of smoking, vaccination protocols have been developed. The principle is under the premise that if an antibody is attached to a nicotine molecule, it will be prevented from diffusing through the [[capillaries]], thus making it less likely that it ever affects the brain by binding to [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptors]].  . 

These include attaching the nicotine molecule to a [[hapten]] such as [[Keyhole limpet hemocyanin]] or a safe modified bacterial toxin to elicit an active immune response. Often it is added with [[bovine serum albumin]].  . 

Additionally, because of concerns with the unique immune systems of individuals being liable to produce antibodies against endogenous hormones and over the counter drugs, [[monoclonal antibodies]] have been developed for short term passive immune protection. They have half-lives varying from hours to weeks. Their half-lives depend on their ability to resist degradation from [[pinocytosis]] by [[epithelial cells]]. <ref>Peterson, Eric C., and Michael Owens.

Historically, nicotine has not been regarded as a [[carcinogen]] and the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]] has not evaluated nicotine in its standalone form and assigned it to an official carcinogen group. While no epidemiological evidence supports that nicotine alone acts as a carcinogen in the formation of human cancer, research over the last decade has identified nicotine's [[carcinogenic]] potential in animal models and cell culture. <ref>Hecht SS.

Though the [[Teratogenesis|teratogenic]] properties of nicotine may or may not yet have been adequately researched, women who use [[nicotine gum]]  and patches during the early stages of pregnancy face an increased risk of having babies with birth defects, according to a study of around 77,000 pregnant women in Denmark. The study found that women who use nicotine-replacement therapy in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy have a 60% greater risk of having babies with birth defects, compared to women who are non-smokers.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} . 

Effective April 1, 1990, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) of the [[California Environmental Protection Agency]]  added nicotine to the list of chemicals known to the state to cause developmental toxicity, for the purposes of Proposition 65. <ref>http://oehha.ca.gov/prop65/prop65_list/files/P65single121809.pdf</ref> . 

== Therapeutic uses ==. 
The primary therapeutic use of nicotine is in treating nicotine dependence in order to eliminate [[smoking]] with the damage it does to health. Controlled levels of nicotine are given to patients through gums, dermal patches, lozenges, electronic/substitute cigarettes or nasal sprays in an effort to wean them off their dependence.  . 

However, in a few situations, smoking has been observed to apparently be of therapeutic value. 
These are often referred to as "Smoker’s Paradoxes". <ref name="cohen">

Small studies show some success, even in otherwise treatment-refractory cases. <ref name="pmid15610960">{{cite journal |author=Pasquini M, Garavini A, Biondi M |title=Nicotine augmentation for refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder.

The relationship between smoking and inflammatory bowel disease is now firmly established but remains a source of confusion among both patients and doctors. It is negatively associated with ulcerative colitis but positively associated with Crohn's disease. In addition, it has opposite influences on the clinical course of the two conditions with benefit in ulcerative colitis but a detrimental effect in Crohn's disease. <ref>Thomas GA. Rhodes J.

==Research as a potential basis for an antipsychotic agent==. 
When the metabolites of nicotine were isolated and their effect on first the animal brain and then the human brain in people with schizophrenia were studied, it was shown that the effects helped with cognitive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Therefore, the nicotinergic agents, as antipsychotics which do not contain nicotine but act on the same receptors in the brain are showing promise as adjunct antipsychotics in early stages of FDA studies on schizophrenia. 
The [[prepulse inhibition]] (PPI) is a phenomenon in which a weak prepulse attenuates the response to a subsequent startling stimulus. Therefore, PPI is believed to have face, construct, and predictive validity for the PPI disruption in schizophrenia, and it is widely used as a model to study the neurobiology of this disorder and for screening antipsychotics. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Suemaru K, Kohnomi S, Umeda K, Araki H.|year=2008|title=Alpha7 nicotinic receptor agonists have reported to reverse the PPI disruption|journal=Nihon Shinkei Seishin Yakurigaku Zasshi|volume=28|issue=3|pages=121–6|pmid=18646597|language=Japanese|first1=K|last2=Kohnomi|first2=S|last3=Umeda|first3=K|last4=Araki|first4=H}}</ref>
Additionally, studies have shown{{Weasel-inline|date=January 2012}}<!--where is the URL? damn copyright....(most likely)--> that there are genes predisposing people with schizophrenia to nicotine use. <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = De Luca | first1 = V | last2 = Wong | first2 = AH | last3 = Muller | first3 = DJ | last4 = Wong | first4 = GW | last5 = Tyndale | first5 = RF | last6 = Kennedy | first6 = JL. | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 2004 | title = Evidence of association between smoking and alpha7 nicotinic receptor subunit gene in schizophrenia patients | url = | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 29 | issue = 8| pages = 1522–6 | pmid = 15100704 | doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1300466}}</ref> . 

Therefore with these factors taken together the heavy usage of cigarettes and other nicotine related products among people with schizophrenia may be explained and novel antipsychotic agents developed that have these effects in a manner that is not harmful and controlled and is a promising arena of research for schizophrenia.  .
