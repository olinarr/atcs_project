'''Smoking bans''' (or '''smoke-free laws''') are public policies, including [[criminal law]]s and [[occupational safety and health]] regulations, which [[prohibitionism|prohibit]] [[tobacco smoking]] in [[employment|workplace]]s and other [[public space]]s. Legislation may also define [[smoking]] as more generally being the carrying or possessing of any lit tobacco product. <ref>{{cite web

==Rationale==. 
The rationale for smoking bans posits that smoking is optional, whereas breathing is not. Therefore, proponents say, smoking bans exist to protect breathing people from the effects of [[second-hand smoke]], which include an increased risk of [[heart disease]], [[cancer]], [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|emphysema]], and other diseases. <ref>{{cite web | title=Smokefree legislation consultation response, The Institute of Public Health in Ireland | url=http://www.publichealth.ie/index.asp?locID=396 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071008192053/http://www.publichealth.ie/index.asp?locID=396 | archivedate=8 Oct. 2007 | accessdate=5 Sep. 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=New health bill will ban smoking in majority of workplaces | url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/Nl1/Newsroom/NewsroomArticles/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=10027079&chk=5r8ic9 | accessdate=5 Sep. 2006}} (UK Health Secretary: The smoking ban "is a huge step forward for public health and will help reduce deaths from cancer, heart disease and other smoking related diseases") See also [http://www.who.int/tobacco/framework/WHO_FCTC_english.pdf WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]; First international treaty on public health, adopted by 192 countries and signed by 168. See in particular Article 8 ''Protection from exposure to tobacco smoke''. </ref> Laws implementing bans on indoor smoking have been introduced by many countries in various forms over the years, with some [[legislator]]s citing scientific  evidence that shows tobacco smoking is harmful to the smokers themselves and to those inhaling second-hand smoke.''' . 

In addition, such laws may reduce [[health care]] costs,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barendregt JJ, Bonneux L, van der Maas PJ |title=The health care costs of smoking |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=337 |issue=15 |pages=1052–7 |year=1997 |month=October |pmid=9321534 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&pmid=9321534&promo=ONFLNS19 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199710093371506}}</ref> improve work productivity, and lower the overall cost of labour in the community thus protected, making that workforce more attractive for employers. In the US state of [[Indiana]], the economic development agency included in its 2006 plan for acceleration of economic growth encouragement for cities and towns to adopt local smoking bans as a means of promoting job growth in communities.  . 

Additional rationales for [[smoking]] restrictions include reduced risk of fire in areas with explosive hazards; cleanliness in places where food, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, or precision instruments and machinery are produced; decreased legal liability; potentially reduced energy use via decreased [[HVAC|ventilation]] needs; reduced quantities of litter; healthier environments; and giving smokers incentive to quit<ref>{{cite web | title=New health bill will ban smoking in majority of workplaces | url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/Nl1/Newsroom/NewsroomArticles/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=10027079&chk=5r8ic9 | date=28 October 2005 | accessdate=5 Sep. 2006 }}</ref>.  . 

The [[World Health Organization]] considers smoking bans to have an influence to reduce demand for tobacco by creating an environment where smoking becomes increasingly more difficult and to help shift social norms away from the acceptance of smoking in everyday life. Along with tax measures, cessation measures, and education, smoking bans are viewed by public health experts as an important element in reducing smoking rates and promoting positive health outcomes. When effectively implemented they are seen as an important element of policy to support behaviour change in favour of a healthy lifestyle<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/fctc/en/ |publisher=World Health Organization |title=WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control |accessdate=17 Jun. 2009}}</ref>.  . 

==Medical and scientific basis for smoking restrictions==. 
{{Main|Passive smoking}}
Research has generated evidence that [[second-hand smoke]] causes the same problems as direct smoking, including [[lung cancer]], [[cardiovascular disease]], and [[respiratory disease|lung ailments]] such as [[emphysema]], [[bronchitis]], and [[asthma]]. <ref>{{cite journal

===Air quality===. 
Restrictions upon smoking in bars and restaurants can substantially improve the air quality in such establishments. For example, one study listed on the website of the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] states that New York's statewide law to eliminate smoking in enclosed workplaces and public places substantially reduced RSP (respirable suspended particles) levels in western New York hospitality venues. RSP levels were reduced in every venue that permitted smoking before the law was implemented, including venues in which only [[second-hand smoke]] from an adjacent room was observed at baseline. <ref>{{cite web | title=Indoor Air Quality in Hospitality Venues Before and After Implementation of a Clean Indoor Air Law --- Western New York, 2003 |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |work=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report |date=12 November 2004 |volume=53 |issue=44 |pages=1038–1041 | url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5344a3.htm }}</ref> The CDC concluded that their results were similar to other studies which also showed substantially improved indoor air quality after smoking bans were instituted.  . 

A 2004 study showed [[New Jersey]] bars and restaurants had more than nine times the levels of indoor air pollution of neighbouring New York City, which had already enacted its smoking ban. <ref>{{cite web | title= Study Finds That New Jersey Bars and Restaurants Have Nine Times More Air Pollution than Those in Smoke-Free New York | url= http://www.umdnj.edu/about/news_events/releases/04/r041214_bars.htm }}</ref> . 

Research has also shown that improved air quality translates to decreased [[toxin]] exposure among employees. <ref>{{Cite news |author=Nina Athey-Pollard |periodical=Chemical Science | title= Smoking ban leads to healthier bar staff | url=http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/ChemScience/Volume/2006/04/smoking_ban.asp |publisher=RSC Publishing |date=16 March 2006 |postscript=<!--None--> }}</ref> For example, among employees of the Norwegian establishments that enacted smoking restrictions, tests showed improved (i.e. decreased) levels of [[nicotine]] in the urine of both smoking and non-smoking workers (as compared with measurements prior to going smoke-free). <ref>{{cite journal |author=Ellingsen DG, Fladseth G, Daae HL, ''et al.'' |title=Airborne exposure and biological monitoring of bar and restaurant workers before and after the introduction of a smoking ban |journal=J Environ Monit |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=362–8 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16528420 |doi=10.1039/b600050a }}</ref> . 

===Public Health Law Research===. 
In 2009, the journal Public Health Law Research published an evidence brief summarising the research assessing the effect of a specific law or policy on public health. They stated that "There is strong evidence supporting smoking bans and restrictions as effective public health interventions aimed at decreasing exposure to secondhand smoke."<ref>[http://www.publichealthlawresearch.org/public-health-topics/drugs-alcohol-and-tobacco/evidence-brief/workplace-smoking-bans-and-restriction Workplace Smoking Bans and Restrictions, Public Health Law Research 2009]</ref> .

[[File:Smoke Ban ABC.ogv|thumb|1973 and 2007 [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] news reports on the initial, and then the complete, indoor smoking bans in [[Victoria, Australia]].]]
One of the world's earliest smoking bans was a 1575 Mexican ecclesiastical council regulation which forbade the use of tobacco in any church in Mexico and Spanish colonies in the Caribbean. In 1604, King [[James VI and I|James I of England]] published an anti-smoking treatise, [[A Counterblaste to Tobacco]], that had the effect of raising taxes on tobacco. The Ottoman Sultan [[Murad IV]] prohibited smoking in his empire in 1633. <ref name="theatlantic.com">“The ashtray of history”, the Atlantic Magazine, available at: http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/01/the-ashtray-of-history/5532/</ref> Pope Urban VII also prohibited smoking in the Church in 1590<ref>Lader, Malcolm Harold; Henningfield, Jack E.; Martin Jarvis (1985). Nicotine, an old-fashioned addiction. London: Burke Publishing. pp. 96–8. </ref> followed by Urban VIII in 1624. <ref name="theatlantic.com"/> Pope Urban VII in particular threatened to [[excommunication|excommunicate]] anyone who "took tobacco in the porchway of or inside a church, whether it be by chewing it, smoking it with a pipe or sniffing it in powdered form through the nose". <ref>{{cite book |author=Lader, Malcolm Harold; Henningfield, Jack E.; Martin Jarvis |title=Nicotine, an old-fashioned addiction |publisher=Burke Publishing |location=London |year=1985 |pages=96–8 |isbn=0-222-01216-1 }}</ref> The earliest citywide European smoking bans were enacted shortly thereafter. Such bans were enacted in [[Bavaria]], Kursachsen, and certain parts of Austria in the late 17th century. Smoking was banned in Berlin in 1723, in [[Königsberg]] in 1742, and in [[Szczecin|Stettin]] in 1744. These bans were repealed in the [[revolutions of 1848]]. <ref>{{cite journal |last=Proctor |first=RN |year=1997 |month=Fall |title= The Nazi war on tobacco: ideology, evidence, and possible cancer consequences |journal=Bull Hist Med |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=435–88 |pmid=9302840 |doi=10.1353/bhm.1997.0139 }}</ref> The first building in the world to ban smoking was the [[Old Government Buildings, Wellington|Old Government Building]] in [[Wellington]], New Zealand in 1876.

The first modern attempt at restricting smoking was [[Anti-tobacco movement in Nazi Germany|imposed by the then German government]] in every university, post office, military hospital, and Nazi Party office, under the auspices of Karl Astel's Institute for Tobacco Hazards Research, created in 1941 under orders from [[Adolf Hitler]]. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Proctor RN |title=Commentary: Schairer and Schöniger's forgotten tobacco epidemiology and the Nazi quest for racial purity |journal=Int J Epidemiol |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=31–4 |year=2001 |month=February |pmid=11171846 |url=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/30/1/31 |doi=10.1093/ije/30.1.31}}</ref> Major anti-tobacco campaigns were widely broadcast by the Nazis until the demise of the regime in 1945. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Proctor RN |title=The anti-tobacco campaign of the Nazis: a little known aspect of public health in Germany, 1933-45 |journal=BMJ |volume=313 |issue=7070 |pages=1450–3 |year=1996 |month=December |pmid=8973234 |pmc=2352989 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/313/7070/1450}}</ref> . 

In the latter part of the 20th century, as research on the risks of second-hand tobacco smoke became public, the tobacco industry launched "courtesy awareness" campaigns. Fearing reduced sales, the industry created a media and legislative programme that focused upon "accommodation". Tolerance and courtesy were encouraged as a way to ease heightened tensions between smokers and those around them, while avoiding smoking bans. In the USA, states were encouraged to pass laws providing separate smoking sections. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/cgi/getdoc?tid=pmn67d00&fmt=pdf&ref=results |title=Preemption/Accommodation presentation |work=Legacy Tobacco Documents Library |publisher=University of California at San Francisco |author=Daragan K, Fisher S, Keane D, Lattanzio T, Laufer D, Pontarelli J, Trach B, Walls T |date=30 Jun. 1994 |format=PDF |accessdate=23 Nov. 2006}}</ref> . 

In 1975, the US state of Minnesota enacted the ''Minnesota Clean Indoor Air Act'', making it the first state to restrict smoking in most public spaces. At first, restaurants were required to have No Smoking sections, and bars were exempt from the Act. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/indoorair/mciaa/ftb/index.html |title=Minnesota Clean Indoor Air Act - Freedom to Breathe |publisher=Minnesota Department of Health}}</ref> As of 1 October 2007, Minnesota enacted a ban on smoking in all restaurants and bars statewide, called the [[Freedom to Breathe Act]] of 2007. <ref>{{cite news |author=Martiga Lohn |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/05/13/minnesota_lawmakers_approve_smoking_ban/ |title=Minnesota lawmakers approve smoking ban |publisher=Boston Globe |date=13 May 2007}}</ref> . 

The resort town of [[Aspen, Colorado]], became the first city in the US to restrict smoking in restaurants, in 1985. <ref>{{cite news |author=Judith Cummings |agency=New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/04/us/beverly-hills-smoking-ban-clears-air-but-ash-trays-stay.html |title=BEVERLY HILLS SMOKING BAN CLEARS AIR BUT ASH TRAYS STAY |publisher=New York Times|date=4 April 1987}}</ref> . 

On April 3, 1987, the City of [[Beverly Hills, California]], initiated an ordance to restrict smoking in most restaurants, in retail stores and at public meetings. It exempted restaurants in hotels - City Council members reasoned that hotel restaurants catered to large numbers of visitors from abroad, where smoking is more acceptable than in the United States.  . 

In 1990, the city of [[San Luis Obispo, California]], became the first city in the world to restrict indoor smoking in all public places, including bars and restaurants. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tobacco.org/News/010129garth.html |author=David E. Garth |title=Letter to Nebraska Senators from San Luis Obispo Chamber of Commerce in favor of Smokefree Legislation |publisher=Tobacco.org |date=29 January 2001 |accessdate=7 Apr. 2007}}</ref> . 

In America, California's 1998 smoking ban encouraged other states such as New York to implement similar regulations. California's ban included a controversial restriction upon smoking in bars, extending the statewide ban enacted in 1994. As of April 2009 there were 37 states with some form of smoking ban. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.no-smoke.org/pdf/mediaordlist.pdf |title=How many Smokefree Laws? |date=6 October 2006 |publisher=American Nonsmokers’ Rights Foundation |format=PDF |accessdate=23 Nov. 2006}}</ref> Some areas in California began banning smoking across whole cities, including every place except residential homes. More than 20 cities in California enacted park and beach smoking restrictions.  . 

Since December 1993, in [[Peru]], it is illegal to smoke in any public enclosed places and any public transport vehicles (according to Law 25357 issued on Nov 27, 1991 and its regulations issued on Nov 25, 1993 by decree D.S.983-93-PCM). There is also legislation restricting publicity, and it is also illegal (Law 26957 May 21, 1998) to sell tobacco to minors or directly advertise tobacco within 500m of schools (Law 26849 Jul 9, 1997).  . 

On 3 December 2003, [[New Zealand]] passed legislation to progressively implement a smoking ban in schools, school grounds, and workplaces by December 2004<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moh.govt.nz/smokefreelaw |author=Ministry of Health |title=Smokefree Law in New Zealand |publisher=moh.govt.nz |date=15 September 2005 |accessdate=24 March 2011}}</ref>. 
On 29 March 2004, the [[Republic of Ireland]] implemented a nationwide ban on smoking in all workplaces. In Norway, similar legislation was put into force on 1 June the same year.  . 

Smoking was banned in all public places in the whole of the United Kingdom in 2007, when England became the final region to have the legislation come into effect (the age limit for buying tobacco was also raised from 16 to 18 on 1 October 2007).  . 

July 12, 1999 a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court in India banned smoking in public places by declaring ``public smoking  as illegal first time in the history of whole world, unconstitutional  and violative of Article  21  of  the Constitution .''The  Bench  headed by  Dr.  Justice  K.  Narayana  Kurup,  held   that ``tobacco smoking'' in public places (in the form of  cigarettes, cigars, beedies or otherwise) ``falls within the mischief of  the penal provisions relating to public nuisance as contained in  the Indian  Penal  Code and also the definition of air  pollution  as contained  in  the  statutes  dealing  with  the  protection  and preservation   of  the  environment,  in  particular,   the   Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution), Act 1981.''
[http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iy7cHw9GgYU3-JSbjFsHr0lU1tRA AFP: Nepal to ban smoking in public places] On 31 May 2011 [[Venezuela]] introduced a restriction upon smoking in enclosed public and commercial spaces. <ref>[[Venezuelanalysis.com]], 30 May 2011, [http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/6226 Smoking Banned in Public and Commercial Closed Spaces in Venezuela]</ref> . 

Smoking was first restricted in schools, hospitals, trains, buses and train stations in Turkey in 1996. In 2008, a more comprehensive smoking ban was implemented, covering all all public indoor venues.  . 

Smoking has been restricted at a French beach - the Plage Lumière in La Ciotat, France, became the first beach in Europe<ref>{{cite news|last=Desk|first=Lifestyle|title=Smoking Ban Announced at Plage Lumière, Provence, France|url=http://theglobalherald.com/smoking-ban-announced-at-plage-lumiere-provence-france/24054/|accessdate=29 August 2011|newspaper=The Global Herald|date=27 August 2011}}</ref> to restrict smoking, from August 2011, in an effort to encourage more tourists to visit the beach.  . 

==Cigarette advertising==. 
In several parts of the world, tobacco advertising and sponsorship of sporting events is prohibited. The bar upon tobacco advertising and sponsorship in the European Union in 2005 prompted Formula One Management to look for venues that permit display of the [[livery]] of tobacco sponsors, and led to some of the races on the calendar being cancelled in favor of more 'tobacco-friendly' markets.  As of 2008, only one Formula One team, [[Scuderia Ferrari]], received sponsorship from a tobacco company. [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] branding appeared on its cars in two races; Monaco and China, as neither restricts tobacco advertising. Despite the EU prohibition from 2005, advertising bill-boards for tobacco were still in use in Germany as of 2011.  . 

MotoGP team [[Ducati Marlboro]] received sponsorship from Marlboro, its branding appearing at races in Qatar and China. 
On 1 July 2009 Ireland prohibited the advertising and display of tobacco products in all retail outlets; when fully implemented, this will mean that shops will have to store cigarettes in closed containers out of sight of customers.  . 

==Public support for smoking bans==. 
A 2007 Gallup poll found that 54% of Americans favoured completely smoke-free restaurants, 34% favoured completely smoke-free hotel rooms, and 29% favoured completely smoke-free bars<ref>[http://www.gallup.com/poll/28216/More-Smokers-Feeling-Harassed-Smoking-Bans.aspx More Smokers Feeling Harassed by Smoking Bans]</ref>.  . 

Another Gallup poll, of over 26,500 Europeans, conducted in December 2008, found that "a majority of EU citizens support smoking bans in public places, such as offices, restaurants and bars." The poll further found that "support for workplace smoking restrictions is slightly higher than support for such restrictions in restaurants (84% vs. 79%). Two-thirds support smoke-free bars, pubs and clubs." The support is highest in countries which have implemented clear smoking bans: "Citizens in Italy are the most prone to accept smoking restrictions in bars, pubs and clubs (93% – 87% “totally in favour”). Sweden and Ireland join Italy at the higher end of the scale with approximately eight out of 10 respondents supporting smoke-free bars, pubs and clubs (70% in both countries is totally in favor)."<ref name="2008-eu-poll">{{cite web| url = http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_determinants/life_style/Tobacco/Documents/eb_253_en.pdf | title = Survey on Tobacco - Analytical Report | publisher=European Commission | author=The Gallup Organization | date = March 2009 | accessdate = 24 May 2009}}</ref> . 

==Effects of smoking bans==. 
===Effects upon health===. 
Several studies have documented health and economic benefits related to smoking bans. In the first 18 months after [[Pueblo, Colorado]] enacted a smoking ban in 2003, hospital admissions for heart attacks dropped by 27% while admissions in neighbouring towns without bans showed no change. The decline in heart attacks was attributed to the ban, which reduced exposure to [[second-hand smoke]]. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Bartecchi C, Alsever RN, Nevin-Woods C, ''et al.'' |title=Reduction in the incidence of acute myocardial infarction associated with a citywide smoking ordinance |journal=Circulation |volume=114 |issue=14 |pages=1490–6 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=17000911 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.615245 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/114/14/1490}}</ref> A similar study in [[Helena, Montana]] found a 40% reduction in heart attacks following the imposition of a smoking ban. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Sargent RP, Shepard RM, Glantz SA |title=Reduced incidence of admissions for myocardial infarction associated with public smoking ban: before and after study |journal=BMJ |volume=328 |issue=7446 |pages=977–80 |year=2004 |month=April |pmid=15066887 |pmc=404491 |doi=10.1136/bmj.38055.715683.55 |laysummary=http://www.no-smoke.org/pdf/HelenaStudyFreedomtoBreathe.pdf}}</ref> However, a 2010 study comparing US nationwide data suggested that smoking bans may not be associated with statistically significant short-term declines in mortality or hospital admissions for myocardial infarction or other diseases. <ref>{{cite journal |author= Shetty KD, DeLeire T, White C, Bhattacharya J |title=Changes in U.S. hospitalization and mortality rates following smoking bans. |journal=Policy Analysis and Management |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=6–28 |year=2011 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pam.20548/abstract |doi=10.1002/pam.20548}}</ref> . 

Researchers at the [[University of Dundee]] found significant improvements in bar workers' [[spirometry|lung function]] and [[inflammation|inflammatory markers]] attributed to the introduction of Ireland's smoking ban; the benefits were particularly pronounced for bar workers with [[asthma]]. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Menzies D, Nair A, Williamson PA, ''et al.'' |title=Respiratory symptoms, pulmonary function, and markers of inflammation among bar workers before and after a legislative ban on smoking in public places |journal=JAMA |volume=296 |issue=14 |pages=1742–8 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=17032987 |doi=10.1001/jama.296.14.1742 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/296/14/1742|laysummary=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/tayside_and_central/6037035.stm | work=BBC News | accessdate=4 Jan. 2010}}</ref> The Bar Workers' Health and Environment Tobacco Smoke Exposure (BHETSE) study found the percentage of all workers reporting respiratory symptoms, such as wheezing, shortness of breath, cough and phlegm production, fell from 69% to 57%. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7879891.stm Ban sees bar staff 'breathe easy']</ref> A group of researchers from [[Turin]], Italy found that smoking restrictions had significantly reduced heart attacks in the city, and attributed most of the reduction to decreased [[second-hand smoke]] exposure. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Barone-Adesi F, Vizzini L, Merletti F, Richiardi L |title=Short-term effects of Italian smoking regulation on rates of hospital admission for acute myocardial infarction |journal=Eur.

===Effects upon tobacco consumption===. 
Smoking bans are generally acknowledged to reduce rates of smoking; smoke-free workplaces reduce smoking rates among workers,<ref>Evans, et. al., Do Workplace Smoking Bans Reduce Smoking?, The American Economics Review, 1999, http://www.jstor.org/pss/117157</ref> and restrictions upon smoking in public places reduce general smoking rates through a combination of stigmatisation and reduction in the social cues for smoking. <ref>Do Smoking Bans Really Get People to Quit?, ABC World News, 8 Nov. 2005, http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/QuitToLive/story?id=1292456</ref> However, reports in the popular press after smoking bans have been enacted often present conflicting accounts as regards perceptions of effectiveness.  . 

One report stated that cigarette sales in Ireland and Scotland increased after their smoking bans were implemented. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article601421.ece|title=Cigarette sales up 5% despite smoking ban | work=The Times | location=London | date=15 Oct. 2006 | accessdate=7 Apr. 2010 | first=Eva | last=Langlands}}</ref> In contrast, another report states that in Ireland, cigarette sales fell by 16% in the six months after implementation of the ban. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article2295859.ece|title=Cigarette sales drop 7% in a month | work=The Times | location=London | date=21 Aug. 2007 | accessdate=7 Apr. 2010 | first=Robin | last=Pagnamenta}}</ref> In the UK, cigarette sales fell by 11% during July 2007, the first month of the nationwide smoking ban, compared with July 2006. <ref>BBC [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7023841.stm Cigarette sales 'slump after ban'] 2 October 2007</ref> . 

A 1992 document from [[Altria Group|Phillip Morris]] summarised the tobacco industry's concern about the effects of smoking bans: "Total prohibition of smoking in the workplace strongly effects {{sic}} tobacco industry volume. Smokers facing these restrictions consume 11%–15% less than average and quit at a rate that is 84% higher than average."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/cgi/getdoc?tid=qhs55e00&fmt=pdf&ref=results|title=Impact of Workplace Restrictions on Consumption and Incidence|author=John Heironimus|date=21 Jan. 1992|format=PDF|accessdate=26 Dec. 2006}}</ref> . 

In the United States, the CDC reported a levelling-off of smoking rates in recent years despite a large number of ever more comprehensive smoking bans and large tax increases. It has also been suggested that a "backstop" of hardcore smokers has been reached: those unmotivated and increasingly defiant in the face of further legislation. <ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/08/AR2007110801094.html Washington Post]</ref> . 

In Sweden, use of [[snus]], as an alternative to smoking, has risen steadily since that nation's smoking ban. <ref>(sv) [http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/artikel_484687.svd SVD: Folkhälsoinstitutet: Snus ger cancer]</ref> . 

Smoking restrictions may make it easier for smokers to quit. A survey suggests 22% of UK smokers may have considered quitting in response to that nation's smoking ban. <ref>BBC News [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4781732.stm A fifth of smokers 'plan to quit'] 8 March 2006</ref> . 

Restaurant smoking restrictions may help to stop young people from becoming habitual smokers. A study of Massachusetts youths, found that those in towns with smoking bans were 35 percent less likely to be habitual smokers. <ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19826552.900-restaurant-smoking-bans-stop-teens-getting-the-habit.html Restaurant smoking bans stop teens getting the habit]  ''New Scientist'' Issue 2655, 10 May 2008, page 4</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Siegel M, Albers AB, Cheng DM, Hamilton WL, Biener L |title=Local restaurant smoking regulations and the adolescent smoking initiation process: results of a multilevel contextual analysis among Massachusetts youth |journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med |volume=162 |issue=5 |pages=477–83 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18458195 |pmc=2948204 |doi=10.1001/archpedi.162.5.477 |url=http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/162/5/477}}</ref> . 

===Effects upon businesses===.

Many studies have been published in the health industry literature on the economic effect of smoking bans. The majority of these government and academic studies have found that there is no negative economic impact associated with smoking restrictions and many findings that there may be a positive effect on local businesses. <ref>{{cite journal |journal=CA Cancer J Clin |year=2007 |volume=57 |issue=6 |pages=367–78 |title= The economic impact of clean indoor air laws |author=Eriksen M, Chaloupka F |doi=10.3322/CA.57.6.367 |pmid=17989131 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/CA.57.6.367/full}}</ref> A 2003 review of 97 such studies of the economic effects of a smoking ban on the hospitality industry found that the "best-designed" studies concluded that smoking bans did not harm businesses. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Scollo M, Lal A, Hyland A, Glantz S |title= Review of the quality of studies on the economic effects of smoke-free policies on the hospitality industry |journal=Tob Control |year=2003 |volume=12 |pages=13–20 |pmid=12612356 |doi=10.1136/tc.12.1.13 |issue= 1 |pmc= 1759095}}</ref> . 

Studies funded by the bar and restaurant associations have sometimes claimed that smoking bans have a negative effect on restaurant and bar profits. Such associations have also criticised studies which found that such legislation had no impact. <ref>[http://www.tlw.org/public/content/Documents/Smoking%20Ban/Economic_Impacts.pdf "Economic impacts"] Tavern League of Wisconsin(broken link)</ref> . 

The following are some examples:
the [[Dallas]] Restaurant Association funded a study that showed a $11.8&nbsp;million decline in alcohol sales ranging from 9 to 50% in Denton, Texas. 
A 2004 study by Ridgewood Economic Associates LTD funded by the Empire State Restaurant and Tavern Association found a loss of 2000 jobs, $28.5&nbsp;million dollar loss in wages, and a loss of $37&nbsp;million in New York State product. <ref>[http://www.tlw.org/public/content/Documents/Smoking%20Ban/NY%20economic%20impact%20study.pdf "The Economic Impact of the New York State Smoking Ban on New York’s Bars"] Tavern League of Wisconsin</ref>
A 2004 study for the [[National Restaurant Association]] of the United States conducted by [[Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu|Deloitte and Touche]] found a significant negative impact. 
The restaurant Association of [[Maryland]] found sales tax receipts for establishments falling 11% in their study. 
Carroll and Associates found bars sales decreased by 18.7% to 24.3% in a number of [[Ontario]] markets following banning smoking in bars. <ref>[http://www.tlw.org/public/content/Documents/Smoking%20Ban/Evans%20Report%20Summary%20(Canada).pdf "Evans Report Summary (Canada)"] Tavern League of Wisconsin (broken link)</ref>
The Buckeye Liquor Permit Holders Association reported that liquor sales were down over $67&nbsp;million dollars while sales for home consumption increased and asked for the smoking ban to be amended in [[Ohio]]. <ref>[http://pjpohio.com/default.aspx Home]</ref> . 

====Australia====. 
A government survey in Sydney found that the proportion of the population attending pubs and clubs rose after smoking was banned inside them. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/no-smoke-signals-a-boom-for-pubs-clubs/2007/09/01/1188067429767.html |title=No smoke signals a boom for pubs, clubs |work=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=1 Sep. 2007 | date=2 September 2007}}</ref> However, a ClubsNSW report in August 2008 blamed the smoking ban for New South Wales clubs suffering their worst fall in income ever, amounting to a decline of $385&nbsp;million. Income for clubs was down 11% in New South Wales. Sydney CBD club income fell 21.7% and western Sydney clubs lost 15.5%. <ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/story/0,668,24111832-2702,00.html The Australian]</ref> . 

====Germany====. 
Smoking restrictions were introduced in German hotels, restaurants, and bars in 2008 and early 2009. The restaurant industry has claimed that some businesses in the states which banned smoking in late 2007 ([[Lower Saxony]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], and [[Hesse]]n) experienced reduced profits. The German Hotel and Restaurant Association (DEHOGA) claimed that the smoking ban deterred people from going out for a drink or meal, stating that 15% of establishments that adopted a ban in 2007 saw turnover fall by around 50%. <ref>[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3058044,00.html/ Germany's Smoking Ban Spreads Through States, ''Deutsche Welle'', 14 January 2007]</ref> Smoking is not permitted in any public transit or in or around railway stations except for the locations expressly indicated for smoking. Smoking on trains itself was prohibited completely by the [[Deutsche Bahn AG]] in 2007, and there was a permanent reduction of smoking compartments on all trains in 2000. <ref>[http://www.businesstraveller.com/news/germanys-deutsche-bahn-trains-to-become-smoke-]</ref> Smoking has restricted in airports and all [[Lufthansa]] planes since the late 1990s<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.cnn.com/1998-03-26/travel/9803_26_smokefree.flights_1_domestic-flights-ban-smoking-northwest-airlines?_s=PM:TRAVEL | work=CNN | title=Nudity, cartoons grab air travelers' attention | date=31 July 2009}}</ref>.   . 

In 2008, [[Bavaria]] was the first federal state of Germany to restrict smoking in every bar and restaurant. After this restriction was criticised as being "too hard" by some members of the governing party [[CSU]], it was relaxed one year later. Supporters of smoking bans then brought about a public referendum on the issue, which led to even firmer restrictions than the initial ban. Thereafter a more comprehensive ban was introduced in 2010<ref>[http://www.thelocal.de/society/20100704-28287.html]</ref>.  . 

====Ireland====. 
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the main opposition was from publicans. Ireland was the world's first country to introduce fully smoke-free workplaces. The Irish workplace smoke-free law was introduced with the intention of protecting workers from [[second-hand smoke]] and to discourage smoking in a nation with a high percentage of smokers. Many pubs introduced "outdoor" arrangements (generally heated areas with shelters). It was speculated by opponents that the smoke-free workplaces law would increase the amount of drinking and smoking in the home, but recent studies showed this was not the case. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://eurpub.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/18/1/63|title=Does smoke-free Ireland have more smoking inside the home and less in pubs than the United Kingdom? Findings from the international tobacco control policy evaluation project | work=The European Journal of Public Health | location=London | year=2008| accessdate=25 Apr. 2010}}</ref> . 

Ireland's Office of Tobacco Control website indicates that "an evaluation of the official hospitality sector data shows there has been no adverse economic effect from the introduction of this measure (the March 2004 national introduction of smoke-free in bars, restaurants, etc). It has been claimed that the smoke-free law was a significant contributing factor to the closure of hundreds of small rural pubs, with almost 440 fewer licences renewed in 2006 than in 2005. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1443931.ece|title=Rural pubs will suffer from smoking ban | work=The Times | location=London | date=27 Feb. 2007 | accessdate=7 Apr. 2010 | first=David | last=Lister}}</ref> . 

====Isle of Man====. 
Smoke-free restrictions came into effect in the [[Isle of Man]] on 30 March 2008.  . 

====India====. 
July 12, 1999 a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court in India banned smoking in public places by declaring ``public smoking as illegal first time in the history of whole world, unconstitutional and violative of Article 21 of the Constitution .The Bench headed by Dr. Justice K. Narayana Kurup, held that ``tobacco smoking in public places (in the form of cigarettes, cigars, beedies or otherwise) ``falls within the mischief of the penal provisions relating to public nuisance as contained in the Indian Penal Code and also the definition of air pollution as contained in the statutes dealing with the protection and preservation of the environment, in particular, the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution), Act 1981. AFP: Nepal to ban smoking in public places</ref> On 31 May 2011 Venezuela introduced a restriction upon smoking in enclosed public and commercial spaces.  . 

====United Kingdom====. 
[[File:Bangor bilingual station no smoking sign.jpg|thumb|150px|right|thumb|An English/Welsh no smoking sign at a railway station]]

Six months after implementation in Wales, the Licensed Victuallers Association (LVA), which represents pub operators across Wales, claimed that pubs had lost up to 20% of their trade. The LVA said some businesses were on the brink of closure, others had already closed down, and there was little optimism trade would eventually return to previous levels. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/news/wales-news/2007/10/12/smoking-ban-has-hit-trade-says-lva-91466-19938086/|title=ic Wales (icwales.icnetwork.co.uk)}}</ref> . 

The [[British Beer and Pub Association]] (BBPA), which represents some pubs and breweries across the UK claimed that beer sales were at their lowest level since the 1930s, ascribing a fall in sales of 7% during 2007 to the smoke-free regulations. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7102937.stm Pub beer sales slump to low point] 20 November 2007, BBC News</ref> . 

According to a survey conducted by pub and bar trade magazine ''The Publican'', the anticipated increase in sales of food following intrduction of smoke-free workplaces did not immediately occur. The trade magazine's survey of 303 pubs in the United Kingdom found the average customer spent £14.86 on food and drink at dinner in 2007, virtually identical to 2006. <ref>[http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Sky-News-Archive/Article/20080641294269 Smoke Ban Fails To Boost Pub Meal Sales] 26 November 2007, SKY News</ref> . 

A survey conducted by [[British Institute of Innkeeping Awarding Body|BII]] (formerly British Institute of Innkeeping) and the Federation of Licensed Victuallers' Associations (FLVA) concluded that sales had decreased by 7.3% in the 5 months since the introduction of smoke-free workplaces on 1 July 2007. Of the 2,708 responses to the survey, 58% of licensees said they had seen smokers visiting less regularly, while 73% had seen their smoking customers spending less time at the pub. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/7147786.stm Smoking ban 'costs pub takings'] 17 December 2007, BBC News</ref> . 

The data suggesting a negative impact on pubs is partly explained by the reclassified of some as restaurants when serving food becomes the prime source of income. As a result, while the number of premises described as pubs went down following the implementation of the legislation, the total number of premises licensed to sell alcohol went up. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/markeaston/2009/07/pubs_arent_dying_they_are_evol.html |title=Pubs aren't dying - they are evolving | work=Mark Easton, BBC News | date=31 July 2009 | accessdate=14 Feb. 2012}}</ref> . 

====United States====. 
In the USA, smokers and hospitality businesses initially argued that businesses would suffer from smoke-free laws. However, a 2006 review by the [[Surgeon General of the United States|U.S. Surgeon General]] found that smoking restrictions were unlikely to harm businesses in practice, and that many restaurants and bars might see increased business. <ref>{{cite web | title=The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon General | url=http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/secondhandsmoke | accessdate=27 Jun. 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Richard Roesler: Surgeon general: No safe level of secondhand smoke. | url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/HEALTH/06/27/involuntary.smoking.ap/index.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060713070715/http://www.cnn.com/2006/HEALTH/06/27/involuntary.smoking.ap/index.html | archivedate=13 Jul. 2006 | accessdate=27 Jun. 2006 | work=CNN}}</ref> . 

In 2003, New York City amended its smoke-free law to include all restaurants and bars, including those in private clubs, making it, along with the California smoke-free law, one of the toughest in the United States. The city's Department of Health found in a 2004 study that air pollution levels had decreased sixfold in bars and restaurants after the restrictions went into effect, and that New Yorkers had reported less second-hand smoke in the workplace. The study also found the city's restaurants and bars prospered despite the smoke-free law, with increases in jobs, liquor licenses, and business tax payments. The President of the New York nightlife association remarked that the study was not wholly representative, as by not differentiating between restaurants and nightclubs, the reform may have caused businesses like nightclubs and bars to suffer instead. <ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE2D91E30F93AA15750C0A9629C8B63&sec=health Bars and Restaurants Thrive Amid Smoking Ban, Study Says] 29 March 2003, ''The New York Times''</ref> A 2006 study by the New York State Department of Health found similar results: "(...) the CIAA has not had any significant negative financial effect on restaurants and bars in either the short or the long term."<ref>Mark Engelen, Matthew Farrelly & Andrew Hyland: ''[http://www.health.state.ny.us/prevention/tobacco_control/docs/ciaa_impact_report.pdf The Health and Economic Impact of New York's Clean Indoor Air Act].''

===Effects upon musical instruments===. 
Bellows-driven instruments – such as the [[accordion]], [[concertina]], [[Diatonic button accordion|melodeon]] and [[Uilleann pipes|Uilleann]] (or Irish) bagpipes – reportedly need less frequent cleaning and maintenance as a result of the Irish smoke-free law. <ref>John F.

Prison officials and guards are sometimes worried due to previous events in other prisons concerning riots, fostering a cigarette black market within the prison, and other problems resulting from total prison smoking restrictions. Prisons have experienced riots when placing smoking restrictions into effect resulting in prisoners setting fires, destroying prison property, persons being assaulted, injured, and stabbed. One prison in Canada had some guards reporting breathing difficulties from the fumes of prisoners smoking artificial cigarettes made from nicotine patches lit by creating sparks from inserting metal objects into electrical outlets. <ref>[http://www.smokersclubinc.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=723 The Smokers Club, Inc. - Prison Ban Casualty<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://libcom.org/news/prisoner-riot-reverses-smoking-ban-09022008 Prisoner riot reverses smoking ban | libcom.org<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  For example in 2008, the Orsainville Detention Centre near Quebec City, withdrew its smoke-free provision following a riot. But the feared increase in tension and violence expected in association with smoking restrictions has generally not been experienced in practice. <ref name="tbcontrol" /> .

In reality, however, high levels of compliance with smoke-free laws (in excess of 90 per cent) have been reported in most jurisdictions including New York,<ref name="urltobaccofreecenter.org">{{cite web |url=http://tobaccofreecenter.org/files/pdfs/en/SF_laws_work_en.pdf |title=tobaccofreecenter.org |work=|accessdate=}}</ref> Ireland,<ref name="urlRecord compliance with smoking ban - The Irish Times - Mon, 22 Jun 2009">{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0622/breaking34.htm |title=Record compliance with smoking ban - The Irish Times - Mon, 22 Jun 2009 |work=|accessdate= |date=6 June 2009}}</ref> Italy<ref name="urlTimes Higher Education - Italian smoking ban leads to drop in heart attacks">{{cite web |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=205787&sectioncode=26 |title=Times Higher Education - Italian smoking ban leads to drop in heart attacks |work=|accessdate=}}</ref> and Scotland. <ref name="urlScottish Government: Web page currently unavailable.">{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2006/06/26080617 |title=Scottish Government: Web page currently unavailable. |work=|accessdate=}}</ref> Poor compliance was reported in [[Kolkata]]. <ref name="urlSmoking ban up in smoke in Kolkata">{{cite web |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/smoking-ban-up-in-smoke-in-kolkata/427307/ |title=Smoking ban up in smoke in Kolkata |work=|accessdate=}}</ref> . 

==Criticism of smoke-free laws==. 
Smoke-free regulations and ordinances have been criticised on a number of grounds.  . 

===Government interference with personal lifestyle===. 
Critics of smoke-free provisions, including musician [[Joe Jackson (musician)|Joe Jackson]],<ref>{{cite web | title=The Official Website of Joe Jackson | url=http://www.joejackson.com/smoking.php | accessdate=12 Apr. 2007 }}</ref> and political essayist [[Christopher Hitchens]],<ref>[http://spectator.org/archives/2005/06/23/smoking-room The American Spectator : Smoking Room<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2007/may/14/health.smoking | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Is the smoking ban a good idea? | first=Simon | last=Hoggart | date=18 May 2007 | accessdate=7 Apr. 2010}}</ref> have claimed that regulation efforts are misguided. Typically, such arguments are based upon an interpretation of [[John Stuart Mill]]'s [[harm principle]] which perceives smoke-free laws as an obstacle to tobacco consumption per se, rather than a bar upon harming other people.  . 

Such arguments, which usually refer to the notion of personal liberty, have themselves been criticised by [[Nobel Prize]]-winning economist [[Amartya Sen]] who defended smoke-free regulations on several grounds. <ref name="AmartyaSen"/> Among other things, Sen argued that while a person may be free to acquire the habit of smoking, they thereby restrict their own freedom in the future given that the habit of smoking is hard to break. <ref name="AmartyaSen"/> Sen also pointed out the heavy costs that smoking inevitably imposes on every society which grants smokers unrestricted access to public services (which, Sen noted, every society that is not "monstrously unforgiving" would do). <ref name="AmartyaSen"/> Arguments which invoke the notion of personal liberty against smoke-free laws are thus incomplete and inadequate, according to Sen<ref name="AmartyaSen">{{cite news |title=Unrestrained smoking is a libertarian half-way house |author=Amartya Sen |first=Amartya |last=Sen |authorlink=Amartya Sen |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |date=11 February 2007 }}</ref>.  . 

===Property rights=== . 

Some critics of smoke-free laws emphasise the property rights of business owners, drawing a distinction between nominally public places (such as government buildings) and privately-owned establishments (such as bars and restaurants). Citing economic efficiency, some economists suggest that the basic institutions of private property rights and contractual freedom are capable of resolving conflicts between the preferences of smokers and those who seek a smoke-free environment, without government intrusion. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iedm.org/uploaded/pdf/avril05_en.pdf|title=Valentin Petkantchin, "Should cigarettes be banned in public places?" (Montreal Economic Institute: April, 2005)|format=PDF|accessdate=22 Jun. 2009}}</ref> . 

===Legality of smoke-free regulations===. 
Businesses affected by smoke-free regulations have filed lawsuits claiming that these are unconstitutional or otherwise illegal. In the United States, some cite unequal protection under the law while others cite loss of business without compensation, as well as other types of challenges. Some localities where hospitality businesses filed lawsuits against the State or local government include, [[Nevada]], [[Montana]], [[Iowa]], [[Colorado]], [[Kentucky]], New York, [[South Carolina]], and  Hawaii. <ref>[http://www.lasvegasnow.com/Global/story.asp?s=5973819 Judge Rules Nevada Smoking Ban is Constitutional - Las Vegas Now |<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.montanagaminggroup.com/index.php/fuseaction/topic.subcontent/page/74/parentPage/6 Montana Gaming Group, effect of public smoking ban on Montana businesses | smoking ban in public areas | Helena Montana smoking ban | environmental tobacco smoke}}</ref><ref>[http://www.iowastatedaily.com/articles/2001/09/26/news/20010926-archive5.txt Seven businesses sue over smoking ban<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2007/Jan/31/ln/FP701310383.html Anti-smoking law challenged | The Honolulu Advertiser | Hawaii's Newspaper<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://no-smoking.org/june06/06-23-06-4.html Colorado AG Asks State Smoking Ban Lawsuit Be Dismissed [06/23/06-4&#93;<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.wlky.com/news/10317827/detail.html?rss=lou&psp=news Lawsuit Challenges Louisville's Smoking Ban - Louisville News Story - WLKY Louisville<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&pwst=1&q=smoking+ban+lawsuit+loss&start=20&sa=N smoking ban lawsuit loss - Google Search]</ref><ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-13825459.html Health board stands by smoking ban,: Lawsuit alleges group overstepped its authority | Article from Charleston Gazette | HighBeam Research<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Such lawsuits have generally been unsuccessful.  . 

===Smoke-free laws may move smoking elsewhere===. 
Restrictions upon smoking in offices and other enclosed public places often result in smokers going outside to smoke, frequently congregating outside doorways. Many jurisdictions that have restricted smoking in enclosed public places have extended provisions to cover areas within a fixed distance of entrances to buildings<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.no-smoke.org/learnmore.php?dp=d14%7Cd35%7Cp210|title=Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights – Australia}}</ref>.  . 

The former British Secretary of State for Health [[John Reid (UK politician)|John Reid]] claimed that restrictions upon smoking in public places may lead to more smoking at home. <ref name="MPs to challenge...">{{cite news | title=MPs to challenge ministers' veto on total smoking ban | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/smoking/Story/0,,1669527,00.html | accessdate=7 Oct. 2006 | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Patrick | last=Wintour | date=17 Dec. 2005}}</ref> However, both the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] Health Committee and the [[Royal College of Physicians]] disagreed, with the former finding no evidence to support Reid's claim after studying Ireland,<ref name="MPs to challenge..."/> and the latter finding that smoke-free households increased from 22% to 37% between 1996 and 2003. <ref>{{cite web | title=Smoking ban in public places also cuts smoking at home | url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/331/7509/129-b | accessdate=7 Oct. 2006 }}</ref> . 

In January 2010, the mayor of Boston, Massachusetts, [[Thomas Menino]], proposed a restriction upon smoking inside public housing apartments under the jurisdiction of the Boston Housing Authority. <ref>Smiley, Colneth, Jr., [http://bostonherald.com/news/regional/view.bg?articleid=1229476 "Puffers fuming over planned ban"], ''Boston Herald'', Sunday, 31 January 2010</ref><ref>Fermin, Marisela, [http://sparechangenews.net/news/not-here-you-don%E2%80%99t-plans-ban-smoking-boston-public-housing "Not in Here You Don’t: Plans to Ban Smoking in Boston Public Housing"], ''[[Spare Change News]]'', Boston, 25 March 2010</ref> . 

===Connection to DUI fatalities===. 
In May 2008, research published by Adams and Cotti in the ''Journal of Public Economics'' examined statistics of drunken-driving fatalities and accidents in areas where smoke-free laws have been implemented in bars and found that fatal drunken-driving accidents increased by about 13 percent, or about 2.5 such accidents per year for a typical county of 680,000. They speculate this could be caused by smokers driving farther away to jurisdictions without smoke-free laws or where enforcement is lax. No evidence is presented for jurisdictions where smoke-free laws and enforcement thereof are consistent. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10966152|title=Drunk driving after the passage of smoking bans in bars | work=The Economist | date=3 April 2008}}</ref> . 

=== Effects of funding on research literature ===. 
As in other areas of research, the effect of funding on research literature has been discussed with respect to smoke-free laws. Most commonly, studies which found few or no positive and/or negative effects of smoke-free laws and which were funded by tobacco companies have been delegitimised because they were seen as biased in favor of their funders. <ref>e.g. mentioned on p. 167 in [http://econjwatch.org/issues/volume-4-issue-3-september-2007] ''Econ Journal Watch, Volume 5, Number 2, pp. 163-168. . Retrieved 19 November 2009. </ref> . 

Professor of Economics at the California State Polytechnic University-San Luis Obispo, Michael L. Marlow, defended "tobacco-sponsored" studies arguing that all studies merited "scrutiny and a degree of skepticism," irrespective of their funding. He wished for the basic assumption that every author were "fair minded and trustworthy, and deserves being heard out" and for less attention to research funding when evaluating the results of a study. Marlow suggests that studies funded by tobacco companies are viewed and dismissed as "deceitful,"<ref>Marlow, Michael L. 2008. Honestly, Who Else Would Fund Such Research? Reflections of a Non-Smoking Scholar. Econ Journal Watch 5(2): 240- 268. [http://econjwatch.org/articles/honestly-who-else-would-fund-such-research-reflections-of-a-non-smoking-scholar]</ref> i.e. as being driven by (conscious) bad [[intention]].  . 

==Alternatives to smoke-free laws==. 
===Incentives for voluntarily smoke-free establishments===. 
During the debates over the Washington, DC, smoke-free law, city council member [[Carol Schwartz]] proposed legislation that would have enacted either a substantial tax credit for businesses that chose to voluntarily restrict smoking or a quadrupling of the annual business license fee for bars, restaurants and clubs that wished to allow smoking. Additionally, locations allowing smoking would have been required to install specified high-performance ventilation systems. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dccouncil.washington.dc.us/SCHWARTZ/smoke-free_workplaces_statement_june14_2005_rls.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080419094903/http://www.dccouncil.washington.dc.us/SCHWARTZ/smoke-free_workplaces_statement_june14_2005_rls.htm |archivedate=2008-04-19 |title=Press Advisory - Statement of Councilmember Carol Schwartz at the 14 June 2005 Smoke-Free Hearing |work=|date=14 Jun. 2005 |accessdate=31 Jul. 2008}}</ref> . 

===Ventilation===. 
Critics of smoke-free laws have suggested that ventilation is a means of reducing the harmful effects of [[second-hand smoke]]. A tobacco industry-funded study conducted by the School of Technology of the [[University of Glamorgan]] in Wales, published in the Building Services Journal suggested that "ventilation is effective in controlling the level of contamination", although "ventilation can only dilute or partially displace contaminants and occupational exposure limits are based on the 'as low as reasonably practicable' principle". <ref>Cited at parliament.uk. "[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmhealth/485/48506.htm Dealing with the health effects of secondhand smoke]". Accessed 26 August 2010. </ref> <ref>Cited at parliament.uk. "[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmhealth/485/485iwe14.htm COMMENTARY ON STUDIES CARRIED OUT BY DR ANDREW GEENS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF GLAMORGAN SCHOOL OF TECHNOLOGY]". Accessed 29 December 2011. </ref>  . 

Some hospitality organisations have claimed that ventilation systems could bring venues into line with smoke-free restaurant ordinances. A study published by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers and funded by the [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]] found one establishment with lower air quality in the non-smoking section, due to improperly installed ventilation systems. They also determined that even properly functioning systems "are not substitutes for smoking bans in controlling environmental smoke exposure."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rwjf.org/pr/product.jsp?id=15600|title=Can Displacement Ventilation Control Secondhand ETS?}}</ref> . 

The tobacco industry has focused on proposing ventilation as an alternative to smoke-free laws, though this approach has not been widely adopted in the U.S. because "in the end, it is simpler, cheaper, and healthier to end smoking."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Drope J, Bialous SA, Glantz SA |title=Tobacco industry efforts to present ventilation as an alternative to smoke-free environments in North America |journal=Tobacco control |volume= 13|issue=Suppl 1 |pages=i41–7 |year=2004 |pmid=14985616 |doi=10.1136/tc.2003.004101 |pmc=1766145}}</ref> The Italian smoke-free law ban permits dedicated smoking rooms with automatic doors and smoke extractors. Nevertheless, few Italian establishments are creating smoking rooms due to the additional cost. <ref>BBC News [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4159587.stm Italians fume over cigarette curb] 10 January 2005</ref> . 

A landmark report from the U.S. Surgeon General found that even the use of elaborate ventilation systems and smoking rooms fail to provide protection from the health hazards of [[second-hand smoke]], since there is "no safe level of second-hand smoke". <ref>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. ''[http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/secondhandsmoke/ The Health Consequesnces of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon General].'' U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Coordinating Center for Health Promotion, National Center for Chronic Disease prevention and Health Promotion, Office on Smoking and Health, 2006. Accessed 26 August 2010. </ref> . 

==Preemption==. 
A number of states in the United States have "preemption clauses" within state law which block local communities from passing smoke-free ordinances more strict than the state laws on the books. The rationale is to prevent local communities from passing smoke-free ordinances which are viewed as excessive by that state's legislature. Other states have "anti-preemption clauses" that allow local communities to pass smoking ban ordinances that their legislature found unacceptable. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06357/748507-85.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Allegheny County smoking ban put on hold | first1=Gabrielle | last1=Banks | first2=Anita | last2=Srikameswaran | date=23 December 2006}}</ref> . 

==Hardship exemptions==. 
In Wauwatosa, [[Wisconsin]], three restaurants received short-term exemptions from a local smoke-free ordinance in restaurants when they managed to demonstrate financial suffering because of it. <ref>
