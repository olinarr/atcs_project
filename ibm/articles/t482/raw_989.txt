The term '''passive smoking''' refers to the inhalation, usually involuntary, of [[second-hand smoke]] from tobacco products by non-smokers or persons other than the intended 'active' smoker<ref>http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/passive-smoking</ref><ref>http://lungcancer.about.com/od/glossary/g/passivesmoking.htm</ref><ref>http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/passive%20smoking</ref><ref>http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/passive+smoking</ref>. It occurs when tobacco smoke permeates any environment, causing its inhalation by people within that environment.

===Alternative terms===. 
''Passive smoking'' is used widely in news media and in older scientific research papers and may therefore be regarded as a [[common name]] for exposure to [[second-hand smoke]].  More recent scientific literature and regulatory material tends to refer directly to [[second-hand smoke]], and the two terms are effectively employed as synonyms, although etymologically passive smoking is the act or behaviour of exposure to a contaminant, and second-hand smoke the hazardous substance.  A minority of scientific papers, and some material generated by representatives of the tobacco industry, refer to environmental tobacco smoke or 'ETS' rather than either passive smoking or second-hand smoke.  .

{{Main|Second-hand smoke}}
The evidence of health hazards arising from passive smoking and exposure to second-hand smoke have played a central role in the debate over the regulation of tobacco products and smoking. Since the early 1970s, the [[tobacco industry]] has viewed the passive smoking issue as a major threat to its business interests. <ref name="smoke-screen">{{cite web |url = http://dev.ersnet.org/uploads/Document/ab/WEB_CHEMIN_1092_1166196139.pdf |title = Lifting the smokescreen: Tobacco industry strategy to defeat smoke free policies and legislation |publisher = European Respiratory Society and Institut National du Cancer |author = Diethelm P, McKee M |quote = The industry quickly realised that, if it wanted to continue to prosper, it became vital that research did not demonstrate that tobacco smoke was a dangerous community air pollutant. This requirement has been the central pillar of its passive smoking policy from the early 1970s to the present day |date = February 2006 |accessdate = 2009-01-17}}</ref> Harm to bystanders was perceived as a motivator for stricter regulation of tobacco products. Despite the industry's awareness of the harms of second-hand smoke as early as the 1980s, the tobacco industry coordinated a scientific controversy with the aim of forestalling regulation of their products. <ref name=Circ07>{{cite journal|last=Tong|first=EK|coauthors=Glantz, SA|title=Tobacco industry efforts undermining evidence linking secondhand smoke with cardiovascular disease|journal=Circulation|date=2007 Oct 16|volume=116|issue=16|pages=1845–54|pmid=17938301|doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.715888}}</ref>  Nevertheless, as evidence of the hazards of second-hand smoke exposure through passive smoking has accumulated, so has the use of [[smoke-free laws]] (or 'smoking bans') proliferated.  .
