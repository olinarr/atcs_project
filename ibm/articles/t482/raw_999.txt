The '''health effects of tobacco''' are the circumstances, mechanisms, and factors of tobacco consumption on human health. Epidemiological research has been focused primarily on cigarette tobacco smoking,<ref name="WHOPrevalenceAdultsAge15" /> which has been studied more extensively than any other form of consumption. <ref name="WHOMayoReport" /> . 

Tobacco is the single greatest cause of preventable death globally. <ref>{{cite book |title=WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic, 2008: the MPOWER package |year=2008 |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva |isbn=978-92-4-159628-2 |url=http://www.who.int/tobacco/mpower/mpower_report_full_2008.pdf}}{{Page needed|date=November 2010}}</ref> Tobacco use leads most commonly to diseases affecting the heart and lungs, with smoking being a major risk factor for [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], [[stroke]]s, [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) (including [[emphysema]] and [[chronic bronchitis]]), and [[cancer]] (particularly [[lung cancer]], [[Laryngeal cancer|cancers of the larynx and mouth]], and [[pancreatic cancer]]). It also causes peripheral vascular disease and [[hypertension]]. The effects depend on the number of years that a person smokes and on how much the person smokes. Starting smoking earlier in life and smoking cigarettes higher in [[Tar (tobacco residue)|tar]] increases the risk of these diseases. Also, environmental tobacco smoke, or secondhand smoke, has been shown to cause adverse health effects in people of all ages. <ref>Vainio, H., "Is Passive Smoking Increasing Cancer?", (1987) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3303311], Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment, and Health,</ref> Cigarettes sold in [[Underdeveloped country|underdeveloped countries]] tend to have higher tar content, and are less likely to be filtered, potentially increasing vulnerability to tobacco-related disease in these regions. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nichter |first1=Mark |last2=Cartwright |first2=Elizabeth |title=Saving the Children for the Tobacco Industry |journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=236–56 |year=1991 |doi=10.1525/maq.1991.5.3.02a00040}}</ref>
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimates that tobacco caused 5.4 million deaths in 2004<ref name="WHO">[http://www.who.int/entity/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GBD_report_2004update_full.pdf WHO global burden of like ftw!disease report 2008]</ref> and 100 million deaths over the course of the 20th century. <ref name=WHO2>[http://www.who.int/entity/tobacco/mpower/mpower_report_prevalence_data_2008.pdf WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic, 2008]</ref> Similarly, the United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] describes tobacco use as "the single most important preventable risk to human health in developed countries and an important cause of premature death worldwide."<ref name="fn1">"[http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/quit_smoking/you_can_quit/nicotine.htm Nicotine: A Powerful Addiction]."

Smoke contains several carcinogenic pyrolytic products that bind to DNA and cause many [[genetic mutation]]s. There are over 19 known chemical [[carcinogen]]s in cigarette smoke <ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cigarette_smoke_carcinogens</ref>. Tobacco also contains [[nicotine]], which is a highly addictive [[psychoactive]] chemical. When tobacco is smoked, nicotine causes physical and psychological dependency. Tobacco use is a significant factor in miscarriages among pregnant smokers, it contributes to a number of other threats to the health of the fetus such as premature births and low birth weight and increases by 1.4 to 3 times the chance for [[Sudden infant death syndrome|Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)]]. <ref name="SurgeonGeneralPassiveSmoking2006">{{cite web|url=http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/secondhandsmoke/report/fullreport.pdf|title=The health consequences of involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke: a report of the Surgeon General|accessdate=2009-02-15|year=2006|format=PDF|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Office on Smoking and Health|location=Atlanta, U.S., page 93}}</ref> The result of scientific studies done in neonatal rats seems to indicate that exposure to cigarette smoke in the womb may reduce the fetal brain's ability to recognize [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic]] conditions, thus increasing the chance of accidental [[asphyxia]]tion. <ref>{{Cite doi|10.1164/rccm.200711-1739OC}}</ref> Incidence of [[Erectile dysfunction|impotence]] is approximately 85 percent higher in male smokers compared to non-smokers,<ref name="tobaccoprogram.org">{{cite web|title=The Tobacco Reference Guide|url=http://www.tobaccoprogram.org/tobaccorefguide/ch12/ch12p1.htm|accessdate=2006-07-15}}</ref> and is a key factor causing [[erectile dysfunction]] (ED). <ref name="tobaccoprogram.org"/><ref name=pmid15924009>{{Cite pmid|15924009}}</ref><ref name=pmid15146084>{{Cite doi|10.1385/ENDO:23:2-3:087}}</ref> . 

==Health effects==. 
[[Image:Nicotine stains10.JPG|thumb|Nicotine stains on primarily the 2nd and 3rd fingers in a heavy smoker.]]
[[File:Smokingheltheffect.gif|thumb|right|Summary of tobacco related diseases. ''Click to enlarge'']] . 

A person's increased [[risk]] of contracting disease is directly proportional to the length of time that a person continues to smoke as well as the amount smoked. However, if someone stops smoking, then these chances gradually decrease as the damage to their body is repaired. A year after quitting, the risk of contracting heart disease is half that of a continuing smoker. <ref>[http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4735 "Smoking Cessation Guidelines"] American Heart Foundation</ref> The health risks of smoking are not uniform across all smokers. Risks vary according to amount of tobacco smoked, with those who smoke more at greater risk. Light cigarette smoking still poses a significant (though reduced) health risk, as does pipe and cigar smoking{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}. Smoking so-called "light" cigarettes does not reduce the risk.  . 

Tobacco use most commonly leads to diseases affecting the heart and [[respiratory system|lungs]] and will most commonly affect areas such as hands or feet with first signs of smoking related health issues showing up as numbness, with smoking being a major risk factor for [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease]] (COPD), [[emphysema]], and [[cancer]], particularly [[lung cancer]], cancers of the [[larynx]] and [[mouth]], and [[pancreatic cancer]]. Overall life expectancy is also reduced in regular smokers, with estimates ranging from 10<ref name="bmj.bmjjournals.com.331"/> to 17.9 <ref>Contingencies May–June 1990. http://tobaccodocuments.org/ti/TIMN0020615-0620.html

===Mortality===. 
Male and female smokers lose an average of 13.2 to 14.5 years of life, respectively. <ref>MMWR April 12, 2002 / 51(14);300–3</ref> . 

According to the results of a 50 year study of 34,486 male British doctors, at least half of all life-long smokers die earlier as a result of smoking. <ref name="bmj.bmjjournals.com.331"/> . 

Smokers are three times as likely to die before the age of 60 or 70 as non-smokers. <ref>{{Cite doi|10.1016/j.ehj.2003.12.015}}</ref><ref name="Doll2004"/><ref>American Journal of Public Health 1995;85: p.1223</ref> . 

In the United States, cigarette smoking and exposure to tobacco smoke accounts for roughly one in five,<ref name="America's Health Rankings">{{cite web|title=Health Determinants|url=http://www.americashealthrankings.org/2010/component/details.aspx|accessdate=2010-12-07}}</ref> or at at least 443,000 premature deaths annually. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Adhikari B, Kahende J, Malarcher A, Pechacek T, Tong V |title=Smoking-attributable mortality, years of potential life lost, and productivity losses—United States, 2000–2004 |journal=MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep |volume=57|issue=45 |pages=1226–8 |year=2008 |pmid=19008791 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5745a3.htm }}</ref> . 

To put this into context, in the US alone, tobacco kills the equivalent of three [[jumbo jet]]s full of people crashing every day, with no survivors. <ref>Never Say Die, an ABC News special by [[Peter Jennings]] 6/27/1996</ref> On a worldwide basis, this equates to a single jumbo jet every hour. <ref>http://ws.missouristate.edu/breatheeasymo/upload/Newsletters/Newsletter62.pdf</ref> . 

===Cancer===. 
The primary risks of tobacco usage include many forms of cancer, particularly [[lung cancer]],<ref>[[American Legacy Foundation]][http://www.americanlegacy.org/PDF/Lung_Cancer_Fact_Sheet.pdf factsheet on lung cancer]; their cited source is: <u>CDC ([[Centers for Disease Control]]) The Health Consequences of Smoking: A Report of the Surgeon General. 2004</u>. </ref> [[kidney cancer]],<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1016/j.juro.2006.07.130}}</ref> [[Laryngeal cancer|cancer of the larynx]] and [[Head and neck cancer|head and neck]], [[breast cancer]],<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1007/s10549-006-9255-3}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|8178779}}</ref> [[bladder cancer]],<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1080/03008880802283664}}</ref> [[esophageal cancer|cancer of the esophagus]],<ref>[http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/EsophagusCancer/DetailedGuide/esophagus-cancer-risk-factors American Society Cancer "What are the risk factors for cancer of the esophagus?]</ref> [[pancreatic cancer|cancer of the pancreas]]<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1007/s00423-007-0266-2}}</ref> and [[stomach cancer]]. <ref>{{Cite pmid|12270001}}</ref> . 

There is some evidence suggesting a small increased risk of [[myeloid leukaemia]], [[Squamous cell carcinoma|squamous cell sinonasal cancer]], [[liver cancer]], [[colorectal cancer]], cancers of [[Gallbladder cancer|the gallbladder]], [[Adrenocortical carcinoma|the adrenal gland]], [[Small intestine cancer|the small intestine]], and various childhood cancers. Recent studies have established a stronger relationship between tobacco smoke, including secondhand smoke, and cervical cancer in women. <ref>(No author listed), "A New Reason Not To Smoke.", (1997), Environmental Health Perspectives, 105(10):1044</ref> . 

The risk of dying from lung cancer before age 85 is 22.1% for a male smoker and 11.9% for a female smoker, in the absence of competing causes of death. The corresponding estimates for lifelong nonsmokers are a 1.1% probability of dying from lung cancer before age 85 for a man of European descent, and a 0.8% probability for a woman. <ref>{{Cite doi|10.1371/journal.pmed.0050185}}</ref> . 

===Pulmonary===. 
[[File:Cancer smoking lung cancer correlation from NIH.svg|frame|right|Since establishing causation through experimental trials was not possible due to ethical restrictions, a lengthy study was conducted in order to establish the strong association necessary to allow for legislative action against tobacco consumption.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}]] . 

In smoking, long term exposure to compounds found in the smoke (e.g., [[carbon monoxide]] and [[cyanide]]) are believed to be responsible for pulmonary damage and for loss of elasticity in the [[pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]], leading to emphysema and COPD. The carcinogen acrolein and its derivatives also contribute to the chronic inflammation present in COPD. <ref name="Facchinetti">{{Cite doi|10.1165/rcmb.2007-0130OC}}</ref> . 

[[Second-hand]] smoke is a mixture of smoke from the burning end of a cigarette, pipe or cigar and the smoke exhaled from the lungs of smokers. It is involuntarily inhaled, lingers in the air hours after cigarettes have been extinguished, and can cause a wide range of adverse health effects, including cancer, [[respiratory tract infection (disambiguation)|respiratory infections]] and [[asthma]]. <ref name="ALASecondhandSmokeFactSheet">[http://www.lungusa.org/site/pp.asp?c=dvLUK9O0E&b=35422#one "Secondhand Smoke Fact Sheet", ''American Lung Association''] June 2007. </ref> Non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke at home or work increase their heart disease risk by 25–30% and their lung cancer risk by 20–30%. Second-hand smoke has been estimated to cause 38,000 deaths per year, of which 3,400 are deaths from lung cancer in non-smokers. <ref>[http://www.tobaccofreefloridanewsroom.com/?cat=6 "Tobacco-Free Florida", ''Centers for Disease Control & Prevention Fact Sheets'']</ref> . 

[[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) caused by smoking, is a permanent, incurable (often terminal) reduction of pulmonary capacity characterised by shortness of breath, wheezing, persistent cough with [[sputum]], and damage to the lungs, including [[emphysema]] and [[chronic bronchitis]]. <ref>{{Cite doi|10.1136/bmj.332.7550.1142}}</ref> . 

===Cardiovascular===. 
Inhalation of tobacco smoke causes several immediate responses within the heart and blood vessels. Within one minute the heart rate begins to rise, increasing by as much as 30 percent during the first 10 minutes of smoking. Carbon monoxide in tobacco smoke exerts its [[carbon monoxide poisoning|negative effects]] by reducing the blood’s ability to carry oxygen. Both of these conditions can become permanent with prolonged use of cigarettes. <ref>{{Cite journal|author=Haldane J|year=1895|title=The action of carbonic oxide on man|journal=J Physiol|volume=18|pages=430–462|pmid=16992272|issue=5–6|pmc=1514663}}</ref> . 

Smoking also increases the chance of [[heart disease]], [[stroke]], [[atherosclerosis]], and [[peripheral vascular disease]]. Several ingredients of tobacco lead to the narrowing of blood vessels, increasing the likelihood of a blockage, and thus a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] or [[stroke]]. According to a study by an international team of [[James A. Schoenberger|researchers]], people under 40 are five times more likely to have a heart attack if they smoke. <ref name="news.bbc.co.uk.330">{{Cite news|title=Health : Young smokers' heart attack risk|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3590320.stm|accessdate=2005-12-18|publisher=BBC  | date=2004-08-24}}</ref> . 

Recent research by American biologists has shown that cigarette smoke also influences the process of cell division in the cardiac muscle and changes the heart's shape. <ref name="InfoNIAC.com">{{Cite news|title=Cigarette Smoke Changes Heart's Shape|url=http://www.infoniac.com/health-fitness/cigarette-smoke-changes-heart-s-shape.html|accessdate=2009-01-10|publisher=InfoNIAC.com}}</ref> . 

The usage of tobacco has also been linked to [[Buerger's disease]] (''thromboangiitis obliterans'') the acute inflammation and thrombosis (clotting) of arteries and veins of the hands and feet.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} . 

The current US Surgeon General’s Report concludes that there is no risk-free level of exposure to [[second-hand smoke]]. Even short exposures to second-hand smoke can cause blood [[platelets]] to become stickier, damage the lining of [[blood vessel]]s, decrease coronary flow velocity reserves, and reduce heart rate variability, potentially increasing the risk of [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. New research indicates that private research conducted by cigarette company [[Philip Morris International|Philip Morris]] in the 1980s showed that second-hand smoke was toxic, yet the company suppressed the finding during the next two decades. <ref name="ALASecondhandSmokeFactSheet" /> . 

Although cigarette smoking causes a greater increase of the risk of cancer than cigar smoking, cigar smokers still have an increased risk for many health problems, including cancer, when compared to non-smokers. <ref name=NCIcigar>{{Cite journal|author=David M. Burns, M.D.|title=Cigars: Health Effects and Trends|date=February 1998|url=http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/tcrb/monographs/9/index.html}}</ref><ref name=Symm>{{Cite doi|10.1007/s10935-005-5389-z}}</ref> As for second-hand smoke, the NIH study points to the large amount of smoke generated by one cigar, saying "cigars can contribute substantial amounts of tobacco smoke to the indoor environment; and, when large numbers of cigar smokers congregate together in a cigar smoking event, the amount of ETS [i.e. second-hand smoke] produced is sufficient to be a health concern for those regularly required to work in those environments."<ref name=NIH/> . 

Smoking tends to increase blood cholesterol levels. Furthermore, the ratio of high-density lipoprotein (the "good" cholesterol) to low-density lipoprotein (the "bad" cholesterol) tends to be lower in smokers compared to non-smokers. Smoking also raises the levels of fibrinogen and increases platelet production (both involved in blood clotting) which makes the blood viscous. Carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying component in red blood cells), resulting in a much stabler complex than haemoglobin bound with oxygen or carbon dioxide—the result is permanent loss of blood cell functionality. Blood cells are naturally recycled after a certain period of time, allowing for the creation of new, functional erythrocytes. However, if carbon monoxide exposure reaches a certain point before they can be recycled, hypoxia (and later death) occurs. All these factors make smokers more at risk of developing various forms of arteriosclerosis. As the arteriosclerosis progresses, blood flows less easily through rigid and narrowed blood vessels, making the blood more likely to form a thrombosis (clot). Sudden blockage of a blood vessel may lead to an infarction (stroke). However, it is also worth noting that the effects of smoking on the heart may be more subtle. These conditions may develop gradually given the smoking-healing cycle (the human body heals itself between periods of smoking), and therefore a smoker may develop less significant disorders such as worsening or maintenance of unpleasant dermatological conditions, e.g. eczema, due to reduced blood supply. Smoking also increases blood pressure and weakens blood vessels. <ref name="ReferenceA"/> . 

===Renal===. 
In addition to increasing the risk of kidney cancer, smoking can also contribute to additional [[renal]] damage. Smokers are at a significantly increased risk for [[chronic kidney disease]] than non-smokers. <ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1186/1471-2458-10-731 | author = Yacoub R.

===Influenza===. 
A study of an outbreak of A(H1N1) influenza in an Israeli military unit of 336 healthy young men to determine the relation of cigarette smoking to the incidence of clinically apparent influenza, revealed that, of 168 smokers, 68.5 percent had influenza, as compared with 47.2 percent of nonsmokers. Influenza was also more severe in the smokers; 50.6 percent of the smokers lost work days or required bed rest, or both, as compared with 30.1 percent of the nonsmokers. <ref name="content.nejm.org">{{cite journal |last1=Kark |first1=Jeremy D.|last2=Lebiush |first2=Moshe |last3=Rannon |first3=Lotte |title=Cigarette Smoking as a Risk Factor for Epidemic A(H1N1) Influenza in Young Men |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=307 |issue=17 |pages=1042–6 |year=1982 |pmid=7121513|doi=10.1056/NEJM198210213071702}}</ref> . 

According to a study of 1,900 male cadets after the 1968 Hong Kong A2 influenza epidemic at a South Carolina military academy, compared with nonsmokers heavy smokers (more than 20 cigarettes per day), had 21% more illnesses and 20% more bed rest, light smokers (less than 20 cigarettes per day) had 10% more illnesses and 7% more bed rest. <ref>Finklea et al. 1969</ref> . 

The effect of cigarette smoking upon epidemic influenza was studied prospectively among 1,811 male college students. Clinical influenza incidence among those who daily smoked 21 or more cigarettes was 21% higher than that of non-smokers. Influenza incidence among smokers of 1 to 20 cigarettes daily was intermediate between non-smokers and heavy cigarette smokers. <ref>{{cite journal |pmid=5356947 |last1=Finklea|first1=JF |year=1969 |pages=390–9 |issue=5 |last2=Sandifer |volume=90 |journal=American journal of epidemiology |first2=SH |last3=Smith|first3=DD |title=Cigarette smoking and epidemic influenza |url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/90/5/390.abstract}}</ref> . 

Surveillance of a 1979 influenza out-break at a military base for women in Israel revealed that, Influenza symptoms developed in 60.0% of the current smokers vs. 41.6% of the nonsmokers. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kark |first1=J D |last2=Lebiush |first2=M |title=Smoking and epidemic influenza-like illness in female military recruits: a brief survey |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=71 |issue=5|pages=530–2 |year=1981 |pmid=7212144 |pmc=1619723 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.71.5.530}}</ref> . 

Smoking seems to cause a higher relative influenza-risk in older populations than in younger populations. In a prospective study of community-dwelling people 60–90 years of age, during 1993, of unimmunized people 23% of smokers had clinical influenza as compared with 6% of non-smokers. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nicholson |first1=K. G. |last2=Kent |first2=J. |last3=Hammersley |first3=V. |title=Influenza A among community-dwelling elderly persons in Leicestershire during winter 1993–4; cigarette smoking as a risk factor and the efficacy of influenza vaccination |journal=Epidemiology and Infection |volume=123 |issue=1 |pages=103–8 |year=1999 |pmid=10487646 |pmc=2810733|doi=10.1017/S095026889900271X}}</ref> . 

Smoking may substantially contribute to the growth of influenza epidemics affecting the entire population. <ref name="content.nejm.org"/>However the proportion of influenza cases in the general non-smoking population attributable to smokers has not yet been calculated.  . 

===Oral===. 
Perhaps the most serious oral condition that can arise is that of [[oral cancer]]. However, smoking also increases the risk for various other oral diseases, some almost completely exclusive to tobacco users. The [[National Institutes of Health]], through the [[National Cancer Institute]], determined in 1998 that "cigar smoking causes a variety of cancers including cancers of the [[oral cancer|oral cavity]] (lip, tongue, mouth, throat), [[Esophageal cancer|esophagus]], [[Laryngeal cancer|larynx]], and [[lung cancer|lung]]."<ref name=NIH>{{cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/apr98/nci-10a.htm|title=Background on Cigar Monograph: Cigars: Health Effects and Trends|date=1998-04-10|accessdate=2008-01-04|author=[[National Institutes of Health]] }}</ref> [[Smoking pipe (tobacco)|Pipe]] smoking involves significant health risks,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/96/11/853/T2|title=Questions About Smoking, Tobacco, and Health|author=[[American Cancer Society]]|accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|15173269}}</ref> particularly oral cancer. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahealthyme.com/topic/pipes|author=Loren Stein|title=Pipe Smoking|publisher=A Healthy Me!|accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=943&page=250|author=Commission on Life Sciences|title=Environmental Tobacco Smoke: Measuring Exposures and Assessing Health Effects (1986)|accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref> Roughly half of [[periodontitis]] or inflammation around the teeth cases are attributed to current or former smoking.

===Infection===. 
Tobacco is also linked to susceptibility to infectious diseases, particularly in the lungs. Smoking more than 20 [[cigarette]]s a day increases the risk of [[tuberculosis]] by two to four times,<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1016/j.trstmh.2005.06.034}}</ref><ref>{{Cite doi|10.1056/NEJMsa0707719}}</ref> and being a current smoker has been linked to a fourfold increase in the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease. <ref>{{Cite doi|10.1056/NEJM200003093421002}}</ref> It is believed that smoking increases the risk of these and other pulmonary and respiratory tract infections both through structural damage and through effects on the immune system.

===Impotence===. 
Incidence of [[impotence]] is approximately 85 percent higher in male smokers compared to non-smokers,<ref name="tobaccoprogram.org"/> and it is a key cause of erectile dysfunction (ED). <ref name="tobaccoprogram.org"/><ref name=pmid15924009>{{cite journal|author=Peate I|title=The effects of smoking on the reproductive health of men|journal=Br J Nurs|volume=14|issue=7|pages=362–6|year=2005|pmid=15924009}}</ref><ref name=pmid15146084>{{cite journal|author=Korenman SG|title=Epidemiology of erectile dysfunction|journal=Endocrine|volume=23|issue=2-3|pages=87–91|year=2004|pmid=15146084|doi=10.1385/ENDO:23:2-3:087}}</ref> Smoking causes impotence because it promotes [[atherosclerosis|arterial narrowing]]. <ref name=pmid15753970>{{cite journal|author=Kendirci M, Nowfar S, Hellstrom WJ.|title=The impact of vascular risk factors on erectile function|journal=Drugs Today (Barc)|volume=41|issue=1|pages=65–74|year=2005|pmid=15753970|doi=10.1358/dot.2005.41.1.875779}}</ref> . 

===Female infertility===. 
Smoking is harmful to the ovaries, potentially causing [[female infertility]], and the degree of damage is dependent upon the amount and length of time a woman smokes. Nicotine and other harmful chemicals in cigarettes interfere with the body’s ability to create [[estrogen]], a hormone that regulates [[folliculogenesis]] and [[ovulation]]. Also, cigarette smoking interferes with folliculogenesis, embryo transport, endometrial receptivity, endometrial angiogenesis, uterine blood flow and the uterine myometrium. <ref>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmq033}}</ref>  Some damage is irreversible, but stopping smoking can prevent further damage. <ref name=asrm-risks>[http://www.protectyourfertility.com/femalerisks.html FERTILITY FACT > Female Risks] By the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM). Retrieved on Jan 4, 2009</ref><ref>http://www.protectyourfertility.com/pdfs/magazine1_v4.pdf</ref> Smokers are 60% more likely to be infertile than non-smokers. <ref name=dh2009/> Smoking reduces the chances of IVF producing a live birth by 34% and increases the risk of an IVF pregnancy miscarrying by 30%. <ref name=dh2009>[http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_101070 Regulated fertility services: a commissioning aid - June 2009], from the Department of Health UK</ref> . 

===Psychological===. 
"Smokers often report that cigarettes help relieve feelings of stress. However, the stress levels of adult smokers are slightly higher than those of nonsmokers, adolescent smokers report increasing levels of stress as they develop regular patterns of smoking, and smoking cessation leads to reduced stress. Far from acting as an aid for mood control, nicotine dependency seems to exacerbate stress. This is confirmed in the daily mood patterns described by smokers, with normal moods during smoking and worsening moods between cigarettes. Thus, the apparent relaxant effect of smoking only reflects the reversal of the tension and irritability that develop during nicotine depletion. Dependent smokers need nicotine to remain feeling normal." <ref>{{cite doi|10.1037/0003-066X.54.10.817}}</ref> . 

====Immediate effects====. 
Users report feelings of [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]], sharpness, [[calmness]], and [[alertness]]. <ref>Gilbert Lagrue, François Lebargy, Anne Cormier, "From nicotinic receptors to smoking dependence: therapeutic prospects" ''Alcoologie et Addictologie'' Vol. : 23, N° : 2S, juin 2001, pages 39S - 42</ref> Those new to smoking may experience [[nausea]], [[dizziness]], and [[tachycardia|rapid heart beat]]. Generally, the unpleasant symptoms will eventually vanish over time, with repeated use, as the body builds a [[drug tolerance|tolerance]] to the chemicals in the cigarettes, such as [[nicotine]].  . 

====Stress====. 
Smokers report higher levels of everyday
stress. <ref name="Addiction 1998">{{cite journal |last1=Parrott |first1=Andrew C. |title=REVIEW Nesbitt's Paradox resolved? Stress and arousal modulation during cigarette smoking |journal=Addiction |volume=93 |issue=1 |pages=27–39 |year=1998 |pmid=9624709|doi=10.1046/j.1360-0443.1998.931274.x}}</ref>
Several studies have monitored feelings of stress over time and found reduced stress after quitting. <ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0022-006X.60.5.689 |last1=Hughes |first1=JR |title=Tobacco withdrawal in self-quitters |journal=Journal of consulting and clinical psychology |volume=60 |issue=5 |pages=689–97 |year=1992 |pmid=1401384}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cohen |first1=Sheldon|last2=Lichtenstein |first2=Edward |title=Perceived stress, quitting smoking, and smoking relapse |journal=Health Psychology |volume=9|issue=4 |pages=466–78 |year=1990 |pmid=2373070 |doi=10.1037/0278-6133.9.4.466}}</ref> . 

The deleterious mood effects of abstinence explain why smokers
suffer more daily stress than non-smokers, and become less stressed when they quit smoking. Deprivation reversal also explains much of the arousal data, with deprived smokers being less vigilant and less alert than non-deprived smokers or non-smokers. <ref name="Addiction 1998"/> . 

Recent studies have shown a positive relationship between psychological distress and salivary cotinine levels in smoking and non-smoking adults, indicating that both firsthand and secondhand smoke exposure may lead to higher levels of mental stress. <ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20529994, Hamer, M., Stamatakis, E., Batty, S. (2010). Archives of General Psychiatry. Doi:0.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.76</ref> . 

====Social and behavioral====. 
Medical researchers have found that smoking is a predictor of divorce. <ref>Bachman, et al., Smoking, Drinking, and Drug Use in Young Adulthood (Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Assoc, Pub, 1997), p 70</ref> Smokers have a 53% greater chance of divorce than nonsmokers. <ref>See Doherty, et al., Cigarette Smoking and Divorce, 16 Families, Systems & Health 393–400 (1998)</ref> . 

====Cognitive function====. 
The usage of tobacco can also create cognitive dysfunction. There seems to be an increased risk of [[Alzheimer's disease]], although "case–control and cohort studies produce conflicting results as to the direction of the association between smoking and AD". <ref name="alzheimer-almeida">{{Cite doi|10.1046/j.1360-0443.2002.00016.x}}</ref> Smoking has been found to contribute to dementia and cognitive decline,<ref name="pmid17573335">{{Cite doi|10.1093/aje/kwm116}}</ref> reduced memory and cognitive abilities in adolescents,<ref name="pmid15607301">{{Cite doi|10.1016/j.biopsych.2004.10.022}}</ref> and brain shrinkage (cerebral atrophy). <ref>{{Cite pmid|14706428}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|9395125}}</ref> . 

In many respects, [[nicotine]] acts on the nervous system in a similar way to [[caffeine]]. Some writings have stated that smoking can also increase mental [[concentration]]; one study documents a significantly better performance on the normed [[Raven's Progressive Matrices|Advanced Raven Progressive Matrices test]] after smoking. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stough |first1=Con |last2=Mangan |first2=Gordon|last3=Bates |first3=Tim |last4=Pellett |first4=O. |title=Smoking and raven IQ |journal=Psychopharmacology |volume=116 |issue=3 |pages=382–4|year=1994 |pmid=7892431 |doi=10.1007/BF02245346}}</ref> . 

Most smokers, when denied access to [[nicotine]], exhibit symptoms such as irritability, jitteriness, dry mouth, and rapid heart beat. <ref name="Why people smoke">{{Cite doi|10.1136/bmj.328.7434.277}}</ref> The onset of these symptoms is very fast, nicotine's half-life being only 2 hours.{{fact|date=February 2012}} Withdrawal symptoms can appear even if the smoker's consumption is very limited or irregular, appearing after only 4–5 cigarettes in most adolescents.{{fact|date=February 2012}} The [[Psychology|psychological]] dependence may linger for months or even many years. Unlike some [[recreational drug use|recreational drugs]], nicotine does not measurably alter a smoker's [[motor skill]]s, [[judgement]], or [[language]] abilities while under the influence of the drug. Tobacco withdrawal has been shown to cause clinically significant distress. <ref>{{Cite doi|10.1080/14622200500494856}}</ref> . 

Most notably, some studies have found that patients with [[Alzheimer's disease]] are more likely not to have smoked than the general population, which has been interpreted to suggest that smoking offers some protection against Alzheimer's. However, the research in this area is limited and the results are conflicting; some studies show that smoking increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease. A recent review of the available scientific literature concluded that the apparent decrease in Alzheimer risk may be simply because smokers tend to die before reaching the age at which Alzheimer normally occurs. "Differential mortality is always likely to be a problem where there is a need to investigate the effects of smoking in a disorder with very low incidence rates before age 75 years, which is the case of Alzheimer's disease," it stated, noting that smokers are only half as likely as non-smokers to survive to the age of 80. <ref name="alzheimer-almeida" /> . 

Former and current smokers have a lower incidence of [[Parkinson's disease]] compared to people who have never smoked,<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1002/mds.20029}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|15706049}}</ref> although the authors stated that it was more likely that the movement disorders which are part of Parkinson's disease prevented people from being able to smoke than that smoking itself was protective. Another study considered a possible role of nicotine in reducing Parkinson's risk: nicotine stimulates the [[dopaminergic]] system of the brain, which is damaged in Parkinson's disease, while other compounds in tobacco smoke inhibit [[Monoamine oxidase B|MAO-B]], an enzyme which produces oxidative radicals by breaking down dopamine. <ref>{{Cite doi|10.1016/j.tins.2004.06.008}}</ref> . 

A very large percentage of [[Schizophrenia#Tobacco|schizophrenics]] smoke tobacco as a form of self medication. <ref name="mcneill">{{Cite journal|author=McNeill, Ann|title=Smoking and mental health – a review of the literature|publisher=SmokeFree London Programme|year=2001|url=http://oldash.org.uk/html/policy/menlitrev.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-10-05 }}</ref><ref name="ocps">{{Cite journal|author=Meltzer, H., Gill, B., Petticrew, M., Hinds.

Recent studies have linked smoking to anxiety disorders, suggesting the correlation (and possibly mechanism) may be related to the broad class of anxiety disorders, and not limited to just depression. Current and ongoing research attempt to explore the addiction-anxiety relationship.  . 

Data from multiple studies suggest that anxiety disorders and depression play a role in cigarette smoking. <ref>{{cite journal |pages=1541–5|doi=10.1001/jama.1990.03450120053028}}</ref>
A history of regular smoking was observed more frequently among individuals who had experienced a [[major depressive disorder]] at some time in their lives than among individuals who had never experienced major depression or among individuals with no psychiatric diagnosis. <ref>{{cite journal |pages=1546–9 |doi=10.1001/jama.1990.03450120058029}}</ref> People with major depression are also much less likely to [[smoking cessation|quit]] due to the increased risk of experiencing mild to severe states of depression, including a major depressive episode. <ref>{{Cite doi|10.1300/J069v17n01_04 }}</ref> Depressed smokers appear to experience more withdrawal symptoms on quitting, are less likely to be successful at quitting, and are more likely to relapse. <ref>{{Cite doi|10.1037/0022-006X.61.5.761}}</ref> . 

Evidence suggests that non-smokers are up to twice as likely as smokers to develop [[Parkinson's disease]] or [[Alzheimer's disease]]. <ref>{{Cite doi|10.1016/S0166-4328(00)00206-0}}</ref> A plausible explanation for these cases may be the effect of nicotine, a [[cholinergic]] [[stimulant]], decreasing the levels of [[acetylcholine]] in the smoker's brain; Parkinson's disease occurs when the effect of [[dopamine]] is less than that of acetylcholine. In addition, nicotine stimulates the mesolimbic dopamine pathway (as do other drugs of abuse), causing an effective increase in dopamine levels. Opponents counter by noting that consumption of pure nicotine may be as beneficial as smoking without the risks associated with smoking, although this is unlikely due to the importance of the MAO-B inhibitor compounds of tobacco in preventing neurodegenerative diseases.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} . 

===In pregnancy and sex===. 
{{Main|Smoking and pregnancy}}
A number of studies have shown that tobacco use is a significant factor in [[miscarriage]]s among [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] smokers, and that it contributes to a number of other threats to the health of the foetus.  . 

Environmental tobacco smoke exposure and maternal smoking during pregnancy have been shown to cause lower infant birth weights. <ref>Ward, C., Lewis, S., Coleman, T. (2007) “Prevalence of Maternal Smoking and Environmental Tobacco Smoke Exposure During Pregnancy and Impact on Birth Weight: Retrospective Study Using Millennium Cohort.” 16;7:81</ref> . 

Studies have shown an association between prenatal exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and conduct disorder in children. As well, post-natal tobacco smoke exposure may cause similar behavioral problems in children. <ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1862932, Braun, J., Froehlich, T., Daniels, J., Dietrich, K., Hornung, R., Auinger, P., Lanphear, B. (2008). “Association of Environmental Toxicants and Conduct Disorder in U.S. Children: NHANES 2001-2004.” Environmental Health Perspectives. 116(7):956-62</ref> . 

Women who smoke have about a 50% higher chance of giving birth to a child with behavioral disorders, such as ADD, but a recent study in a book called "ADD a different perspective" overturns this, saying that ADD is a genetic trait.  Proof of this comes from a study showing that the people with Attention Deficit Disorder had higher levels of certain hormones as Thom Hartman explains the theory of [[Hunter vs. farmer theory]] <ref>Attention Deficit Disorder : A Different Perception</ref> . 

===Other harm===. 
Studies suggest that smoking decreases appetite, but did not conclude that overweight people should smoke or that their health would improve by smoking. This is also a cause of heart diseases. However due to some new processes of treating tobacco, especially in the case of cigarette, heavy smokers tend to become overweight as the processing involves large quantities of starch. This effect is not seen in occasional smokers. <ref>News-Medical.Net, [http://www.news-medical.net/?id=5991], accessed on Jan 3, 2008</ref><ref>mytelus.com,[http://health.mytelus.com/channel_section_details.asp?text_id=3622&channel_id=1055&relation_id=30136&article_rating=1], accessed on Jan 3, 2008</ref> Smoking also decreases weight by overexpressing the gene [[AZGP1]] which stimulates [[lipolysis]]. <ref name=smoking>{{Cite pmid|19188554}}</ref> .

The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] states that "Much of the disease burden and premature mortality attributable to tobacco use disproportionately affect the poor".

The shift in prevalence of tobacco smoking to a younger demographic, mainly in the developing world, can be attributed to several factors. The tobacco industry spends up to $12.5 billion annually on advertising, which is increasingly geared towards adolescents in the developing world because they are a very vulnerable audience for the marketing campaigns. Adolescents have more difficulty understanding the long term health risks that are associated with smoking and are also more easily influenced by “images of romance, success, sophistication, popularity, and adventure which advertising suggests they could achieve through the consumption of cigarettes”. This shift in marketing towards adolescents and even children in the tobacco industry is debilitating to organizations’ and countries’ efforts to improve child health and mortality in the developing world. It reverses or halts the effects of the work that has been done to improve health care in these countries, and although smoking is deemed as a “voluntary” health risk, the marketing of tobacco towards very impressionable adolescents in the developing world makes it less of a voluntary action and more of an inevitable shift. <ref>Nichter, M., and E. Cartwright. 1991. Saving the children for the tobacco industry. Medical

Many government regulations have been passed to protect citizens from harm caused by public environmental tobacco smoke. The "Pro-Children Act of 2001" prohibits smoking within any facility that provides health care, day care, library services, or elementary and secondary education to children. <ref>Elementary and Secondary Education | Environmental Tobacco Smoke | Pro-Children Act of 2001 | Non-Smoking Policy for Children’s Services | Section 4303</ref>

In the 1930s German scientists showed that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer. <ref>[[Naomi Oreskes]] and [[Erik M. Conway]] (2010). ''[[Merchants of Doubt]]: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming'', Bloomsbury Press, p. 15. </ref> In 1938 a study by a [[Johns Hopkins University]] scientist suggested a strongly negative correlation between smoking and lifespan. In 1950 five studies were published in which "smoking was powerfully implicated in the causation of lung cancer". <ref name=dm/> These included the now classic paper "Smoking and Carcinoma of the Lung" which appeared in the ''[[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]''. This paper reported that "heavy smokers were fifty times as likely as non-smokers to contract lung cancer". <ref name=dm>[[David Michaels (epidemiologist)|David Michaels]] (2008).

In 1953, scientists at the [[Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center|Sloan-Kettering Institute]] in New York City demonstrated that cigarette tar painted on the skin of mice caused fatal cancers. <ref name=naomi/> This work attracted much media attention; the ''New York Times'' and ''Life'' both covered the issue.

A team of British scientists headed by [[Richard Doll]] carried out a longitudinal study of 34,439 medical specialists from 1951 to 2001, generally called the "[[British Doctors Study]]."<ref name="bmj.bmjjournals.com.331">{{Cite doi|10.1136/bmj.38142.554479.AE}}</ref> The study demonstrated that about half of the persistent cigarette smokers born in 1900–1909 were eventually killed by their addiction (calculated from the [[logarithm]]s of the probabilities of surviving from 35–70, 70–80, and 80–90) and about two thirds of the persistent cigarette smokers born in the 1920s would eventually be killed by their addiction. After a ban on smoking in all enclosed public places was introduced in Scotland in March 2006, there was a 17 percent reduction in hospital admissions for acute coronary syndrome. 67% of the decrease occurred in non-smokers. <ref>{{Cite doi|10.1056/NEJMsa0706740}}</ref> . 

The health effects of tobacco have been significant for the development of the science of [[epidemiology]]. As the mechanism of carcinogenicity is radiomimetic or radiological, the effects are [[stochastic]]. Definite statements can be made only on the relative increased or decreased probabilities of contracting a given disease; Philosophically and theoretically speaking, it is impossible to definitively prove a direct causative link between exposure to a radiomimetic poison such as tobacco smoke and the cancer that follows. Tobacco companies have capitalized on this philosophical objection and exploited the doubts of clinicians, who consider only individual cases, on the causal link in the stochastic expression of the toxicity as actual disease. <ref name="Hesari">Review (Helsingin Sanomat 30.3.2008, [http://www.hs.fi/juttusarja/maailmankirjat/artikkeli/Savukkeet+loivat+Amerikan/1135235163312]) on Allan M.

===Occasional smoking===. 
The term "smoker" is used to mean a person who habitually smokes tobacco on a daily basis. This category has been the focus of the vast majority of tobacco studies. However, the health effects of less-than-daily smoking are far less well understood. Studies have often taken the data of "occasional smokers" (those who have never smoked daily) and grouped them with those who have never smoked. <ref name="Bjerregaard, et al">{{cite journal |last1=Bjerregaard |first1=BK |last2=Raaschou-Nielsen |first2=O |last3=Sørensen |first3=M |last4=Frederiksen |first4=K |last5=Tjønneland |first5=A |last6=Rohrmann |first6=S |last7=Linseisen |first7=J |last8=Bergman |first8=MM |last9=Boeing |first9=H |title=The effect of occasional smoking on smoking-related cancers: in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) |journal=Cancer causes & control : CCC |volume=17 |issue=10 |pages=1305–9 |year=2006 |pmid=17111263 |doi=10.1007/s10552-006-0068-9}}</ref> . 

A recent European study on occasional smoking published findings that the risk of the major smoking-related cancers for occasional smokers was 1.24 times that of those who have never smoked at all but the result was not statistically significant. (For a [[confidence interval]] of 95%, this data showed an incidence rate ratio of 0.80 to 1.94.)<ref name="Bjerregaard, et al">(Data reduction used Cox proportional hazard model, stratified by gender and country.)</ref> This compares to studies showing that habitual heavy smokers have greater than 50 times the incidence of smoking-related cancers.  .

Smoke, or any partially burnt organic matter, contains [[carcinogen]]s (cancer-causing agents). The potential effects of smoking, such as lung cancer, can take up to 20 years to manifest themselves. Historically, women began smoking ''en masse'' later than men, so an increased death rate caused by smoking amongst women did not appear until later. The male lung cancer death rate decreased in 1975 — roughly 20 years after the initial decline in cigarette consumption in men. A fall in consumption in women also began in 1975 but by 1991 had not manifested in a decrease in lung cancer related mortalities amongst women. <ref>{{Cite book|author=Jones Mary, Fosbery Richard, Taylor Dennis|title=Biology 1|chapter=Answers to self-assessment questions|page=250|publisher=Cambridge Advanced Sciences|isbn=0-521-78719-X|year=2000}}</ref> . 

Smoke contains several carcinogenic [[pyrolysis|pyrolytic]] products that bind to [[DNA]] and cause [[Mutation|genetic mutation]]s. Particularly potent carcinogens are [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAH), which are [[Toxication|toxicated]] to [[mutagen]]ic [[epoxide]]s. The first PAH to be identified as a carcinogen in tobacco smoke was [[benzopyrene]], which has been shown to toxicate into an epoxide that irreversibly attaches to a cell's nuclear DNA, which may either kill the cell or cause a genetic mutation. If the mutation inhibits [[programmed cell death]], the cell can survive to become a [[cancer|cancer cell]]. Similarly, [[acrolein]], which is abundant in tobacco smoke, also irreversibly binds to DNA, causes mutations and thus also cancer. However, it needs no activation to become carcinogenic. <ref name="Feng">{{Cite doi|10.1073/pnas.0607031103}}</ref> . 

There are over 19 known carcinogens in cigarette smoke. <ref>{{cite web|author=Dr. [[C. Everett Koop]]|title=Smoking and smokeless tobacco|url=http://www.drkoop.com/ency/93/002032.html|accessdate=July 15, 2006}}</ref> The following are some of the most potent carcinogens:
* '''[[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|Polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons]]''' are [[Tar (tobacco residue)|tar]] components produced by [[pyrolysis]] in smoldering organic matter and emitted into smoke. Many of them are highly carcinogenic and mutagenic, because they are [[Toxication|toxicated]] to [[mutagen]]ic [[epoxide]]s, which are [[electrophilic alkylating agent]]s. The first PAH to be identified as a carcinogen in tobacco smoke was '''[[benzopyrene]]''', which been shown to toxicate into a diol epoxide and then permanently attach to nuclear DNA, which may either kill the cell or cause a [[Mutation|genetic mutation]]. The DNA contains the information on how the cell function; in practice, it contains the recipes for protein synthesis. If the mutation inhibits [[programmed cell death]], the cell can survive to become a [[cancer|cancer cell]], a cell that does not function like a normal cell. The carcinogenity is radiomimetic, i.e. similar to that produced by ionizing nuclear radiation. Tobacco manufacturers have experimented with combustionless [[vaporizer (cannabis)|vaporizer]] technology to allow cigarettes to be consumed without the formation of carcinogenic benzopyrenes. <ref>{{cite web|title=DNA interaction with Benzopyrene|work=DNA|url=http://www.mybiology.com/chime/dna_benzopyrene/dna_benzopyrene_text.htm|accessdate=March 5, 2005 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20041223072159/http://www.mybiology.com/chime/dna_benzopyrene/dna_benzopyrene_text.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = December 23, 2004}}</ref> However, such products have become increasingly popular, with world wide markets claiming a safer smoke. No conclusive evidence has shown to prove or disprove health claims. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
* '''[[Acrolein]]''' is a pyrolysis product that is abundant in cigarette smoke. It gives smoke an acrid smell and an irritating, lachromatory effect and is a major contributor to its carcinogenity. Like PAH metabolites, acrolein is also an electrophilic alkylating agent and permanently binds to the DNA base [[guanine]], by a [[Nucleophilic conjugate addition|conjugate addition]] followed by cyclization into a [[hemiaminal]]. The acrolein-guanine adduct induces mutations during DNA copying and thus causes cancers in a manner similar to PAHs. However, acrolein is 1000 times more abundant than PAHs in cigarette smoke, and is able to react as is, without metabolic activation. Acrolein has been shown to be a [[mutagen]] and [[carcinogen]] in human cells. The carcinogenity of acrolein has been difficult to study by [[Animal testing|animal experimentation]], because it has such a toxicity that it tends to kill the animals before they develop cancer. <ref name="Feng"/> Generally, compounds able to react by [[Nucleophilic conjugate addition|conjugate addition]] as [[electrophile]]s (so-called ''Michael acceptors'' after [[Michael reaction]]) are toxic and carcinogenic, because they can permanently alkylate DNA, similarly to [[Sulfur mustard|mustard gas]] or [[aflatoxin]]. Acrolein is only one of them present in cigarette smoke; for example, [[crotonaldehyde]] has been found in cigarette smoke. <ref name="Kataoka">Kataoka, H. et al. Chromatographia, Volume 44, Numbers 9–10 / May, Pages 491–496, 1997. DOI: 10.1007/BF02466742</ref> Michael acceptors also contribute to the chronic inflammation present in tobacco disease. <ref name="Facchinetti" />
* '''[[Nitrosamine]]s''' are a group of carcinogenic compounds found in cigarette smoke but not in uncured tobacco leaves. Nitrosamines form on flue-cured tobacco leaves during the curing process through a [[chemical reaction]] between nicotine and other compounds contained in the uncured leaf and various oxides of nitrogen found in all combustion gases. Switching to Indirect fire curing has been shown to reduce nitrosamine levels to less than 0.1 parts per million. <ref>{{cite web|author=Sumner et al.|title=Retrofitting Tobacco Curing Barns|url=http://www.tifton.uga.edu/tobacco/retrofitinfo.htm|accessdate=June 9, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=NOVA|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/cigarette/history2.html|title=Search for a Safer Cigarette|authorlink=Nova (TV series)}}</ref> . 

Sidestream tobacco smoke, or exhaled mainstream smoke, is particularly harmful. Because exhaled smoke exists at  lower temperatures than inhaled smoke, chemical compounds undergo changes which can cause them to become more dangerous. As well, smoke undergoes changes as it ages, which causes  the transformation of the compound NO into the more toxic NO2. Further, volatilization causes smoke particles to become smaller, and thus more easily embedded deep into the lung of anyone who later breathes the air. <ref>Godish, Thad. Indoor Environmental Quality. CRC Press, 2011. ISBN 9781566704021. P 78-79. </ref> . 

===Radioactive carcinogens===. 
In addition to chemical, nonradioactive carcinogens, tobacco and tobacco smoke contain small amounts of [[lead-210]] (<sup>210</sup>Pb) and [[Isotopes of polonium#Polonium-210|polonium-210]] (<sup>210</sup>Po) both of which are radioactive carcinogens. The presence of polonium-210 in mainstream cigarette smoke has been experimentally measured at levels of 0.0263–0.036 [[Curie|pCi]] (0.97–1.33 [[Becquerel|mBq]]),{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chppm-www.apgea.army.mil/documents/TG/TECHGUID/TG238.pdf|author=[[U.S. Army]] Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine|title=Radiological Sources of Potential Exposure and/or Contamination|format=PDF}}{{Dead link|date=June 2011}}</ref> which is equivalent to about 0.1 pCi per milligram of smoke (4 mBq/mg); or about 0.81 pCi of lead 210 per gram of dry condensed smoke (30 Bq/kg).  . 

Research by [[National Center for Atmospheric Research|NCAR]] [[radiochemistry|radiochemist]] [[Edward Martell|Ed Martell]] determined that radioactive compounds in cigarette smoke are deposited in "hot spots" where [[Bronchus|bronchial tubes]] branch. Since tar from cigarette smoke is resistant to dissolving in lung fluid, the radioactive compounds have a great deal of time to undergo [[radioactive decay]] before being cleared by natural processes. Indoors, these radioactive compounds linger in secondhand smoke, and therefore greater exposure occurs when these radioactive compounds are inhaled during normal breathing, which is deeper and longer than when inhaling cigarettes. Damage to the protective [[epithelium|epithelial]] tissue from smoking only increases the prolonged retention of insoluble polonium 210 compounds produced from burning tobacco. Martell estimated that a carcinogenic radiation dose of 80–100 rads is delivered to the lung tissue of most smokers who die of lung cancer. <ref>{{cite web|author=E. A. Martell|year=1983|title=Radiation Dose at Bronchial Bifurcations of Smokers from Indoor Exposure to Radon Progeny|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/80/5/1285|accessdate=June 9, 2006|authorlink=Edward Martell}}</ref> .

Some of the mineral apatite in Florida used to produce phosphate for U.S.A. tobacco crops contains uranium, radium, lead 210 and polonium 210 and radon. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/01/opinion/01proctor.html | work=The New York Times | first=Robert N. | last=Proctor | title=Puffing on Polonium | date=2006-12-01}}</ref><ref>[http://www.epa.gov/radiation/sources/tobacco.html#material_cigarette]</ref> The radioactive smoke from tobacco fertilized this way is deposited in lungs and releases radiation even if a smoker quits the habit. The combination of carcinogenic tar and radiation in a sensitive organ such as lungs increases the risk of cancer. If the smoker also breathes in the asbestos fibers which commonly occur in urban and industrial environments, the risk of cancer is greatly increased.  . 

===Nicotine===. 
[[File:Nicotine-2D-skeletal.png|thumb|Nicotine molecule]] . 

[[Nicotine]] that is contained in cigarettes and other smoked tobacco products is a [[stimulant]] and is one of the main factors leading to continued tobacco smoking. Although the amount of nicotine inhaled with tobacco smoke is quite small (most of the substance is destroyed by the heat) it is still sufficient to cause physical and/or psychological [[Substance dependence|dependence]]. The amount of nicotine absorbed by the body from smoking depends on many factors, including the type of tobacco, whether the smoke is inhaled, and whether a filter is used. Despite the design of various cigarettes advertised and even tested on machines to deliver less of the toxic tar, studies show that when smoked by humans instead of machines, they deliver the same net amount of smoke. Ingesting a compound by smoking is one of the most rapid and efficient methods of introducing it into the bloodstream, second only to injection, which allows for the rapid feedback which supports the smokers' ability to [[Titration|titrate]] their dosage. On average it takes about ten seconds for the substance to reach the brain. As a result of the efficiency of this delivery system, many smokers feel as though they are unable to cease. Of those who attempt cessation and last three months without succumbing to nicotine, most are able to remain smoke free for the rest of their lives. <ref name=NCI_quit>[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Tobacco/cessation Quitting Smoking: Why To Quit and How To Get Help – National Cancer Institute<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> There exists a possibility of depression in some who attempt cessation, as with other psychoactive substances. Depression is also common in teenage smokers; teens who smoke are four times as likely to develop depressive symptoms as their nonsmoking peers. <ref>[http://www.apa.org/monitor/dec00/smoking.html Smoking increases teen depression<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . 

Although nicotine does play a role in acute episodes of some diseases (including [[stroke]], [[Erectile dysfunction|impotence]], and [[heart disease]]) by its stimulation of [[Epinephrine|adrenaline]] release, which raises [[blood pressure]],<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite doi|10.1080/08037050510034202}}</ref> [[heart rate]], and [[free fatty acids]], the most serious longer term effects are more the result of the products of the smouldering combustion process. This has enabled development of various nicotine delivery systems, such as the [[nicotine patch]] or [[nicotine gum]], that can satisfy the addictive craving by delivering nicotine without the harmful combustion by-products. This can help the heavily dependent smoker to quit gradually, while discontinuing further damage to health.  . 

[[Nicotine]] is a highly addictive psychoactive chemical. When tobacco is smoked, most of the nicotine is [[Pyrolysis|pyrolyzed]]; a dose sufficient to cause mild somatic dependency and mild to strong psychological dependency remains. There is also a formation of [[Harmala alkaloid|harmane]] (a [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO inhibitor]]) from the acetaldehyde in cigarette smoke, which seems to play an important role in nicotine addiction<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1016/j.euroneuro.2007.02.013}}</ref> probably by facilitating dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens in response to nicotine stimuli. According to studies by Henningfield and Benowitz, nicotine is more addictive than [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[caffeine]], [[ethanol]], [[cocaine]], and [[heroin]] when considering both somatic and psychological dependence. However, due to the stronger withdrawal effects of [[ethanol]], [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]], nicotine may have a lower potential for somatic dependence than these substances. <ref>[http://www.tfy.drugsense.org/tfy/addictvn.htm Relative Addictiveness of Drugs]</ref><ref>[http://b.rox.com/gizmos/henningfield-benowitz/combo.swf The Henningfield-Benowitz substance comparison charts]</ref> About half of Canadians who currently smoke have tried to quit. <ref>[http://tobacco.aadac.com/about_tobacco/addiction/ AADAC|Truth About Tobacco – Addiction]</ref> [[McGill University]] health professor Jennifer O'Loughlin stated that nicotine addiction can occur as soon as five months after the start of smoking. <ref>[http://lfpress.ca/newsstand/Today/2006/08/02/1714754-sun.html Cigarette addiction faster than expected.] ''The London Free Press'' (August 2, 2006). </ref> . 

Recent evidence has shown that smoking tobacco increases the release of [[dopamine]] in the brain, specifically in the mesolimbic pathway, the same neuro-reward circuit activated by drugs of abuse such as [[heroin]] and [[cocaine]]. This suggests nicotine use has a pleasurable effect that triggers positive reinforcement. <ref>[http://www.nida.nih.gov/MOM/TG/momtg-nicotine.html Nicotine and the Brain]</ref> One study found that smokers exhibit better reaction-time and memory performance compared to non-smokers, which is consistent with increased activation of dopamine receptors. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Parkin |first1=C. |last2=Fairweather |first2=D.

This increase in reward circuit sensitivity persisted months after the self-administration ended, suggesting that nicotine's alteration of brain reward function is either long lasting or permanent.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Furthermore, it has been found that nicotine can activate long term potentiation ''in vivo'' and ''in vitro''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} These studies suggest nicotine’s "trace memory" may contribute to difficulties in nicotine abstinence.{{Or|date=March 2010}} . 

The carcinogenity of tobacco smoke is not explained by [[nicotine]] per se, which is not carcinogenic or mutagenic. However, it inhibits [[apoptosis]], therefore accelerating existing cancers. <ref>{{Cite pmid|7848904}}</ref> Also, [[NNK]], a nicotine derivative converted from nicotine, can be carcinogenic.  . 

It is worth noting that [[nicotine]], although frequently implicated in producing [[tobacco]] addiction, is not significantly addictive when administered alone. <ref name="pmid16177026">{{Cite doi|10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2139-05.2005}}</ref> The addictive potential manifests itself after co-administration of an [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAOI]], which specifically causes [[sensitization]] of the [[Human musculoskeletal system|locomotor]] response in rats, a measure of addictive potential. <ref name="pmid14592678">{{Cite pmid|14592678}}</ref> . 

===Genetic===.

Another study related to genetic changes in smokers was conducted by Wan L Lam and Stephen Lam from the BC Cancer Agency, in 2007. The study revealed that cigarette smoke can turn on or off some of the genes, which otherwise would remain inactive or active respectively. Some changes on genetic level could be reversed after the smoking was quit, yet others could not. Examples of reversible genes involved the so-called xenofobic functions, nucleotide metabolism and mucus secretion. Smoking turns off some DNA repair genes that cannot be reversed. It also switches off some genes responsible from protection from cancer growth in the body. <ref>{{Cite news|title=Genes Permanently Turned On by Smoking|url=http://www.infoniac.com/health-fitness/genes-permanently-turned-on-by-smoking.html|accessdate=2009-01-14|publisher=InfoNIAC.com}}</ref> .

A study on hookah smoking and [[cancer]] in [[Pakistan]] was published in 2008. Its objective was  "to find serum [[Carcinoembryonic antigen|CEA]] levels in ever/exclusive hookah smokers, i.e. those who smoked only hookah (no cigarettes, [[bidi]]s, etc.), prepared between 1 and 4 times a day with a quantity of up to 120 g of a tobacco-molasses mixture each (i.e. the tobacco weight equivalent of up to 60 cigarettes of 1 g each) and consumed in 1 to 8 sessions". Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a marker found in several forms of cancer. Levels in exclusive hookah smokers were lower compared to cigarette smokers although the difference was not statistically significant between a hookah smoker and a non-smoker. Also the study concluded that heavy hookah smoking (2–4 daily preparations; 3–8 sessions a day ; >2 hrs to ≤ 6 hours) substantially raises CEA levels. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sajid |first1=Khan |last2=Chaouachi |first2=Kamal |last3=Mahmood |first3=Rubaida |title=Hookah smoking and cancer: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in exclusive/ever hookah smokers |journal=Harm Reduction Journal |volume=5 |issue=1 |page=19 |year=2008 |pmid=18501010 |pmc=2438352 |doi=10.1186/1477-7517-5-19}}</ref> A recent study published in the Asia Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention (Koul PA et al. Hookah Smoking and Lung Cancer in the Kashmir Valley of the Indian SubcontinentAsian Pacific J Cancer Prev, 12, 519-524; doi.) documented that hookah smokers were nearly 6-times at risk for development of lung cancer as compared to healthy non-smokers in Kashmir (India). Hookah in Kashmir has some peculiar features in having a direct contact of the live embers with the burning tobacco thus resulting in high temperatures that augments the production of carcinogenic products from tobacco burning. Additionally water in the hookah base is not changed after every session that renders the water contaminated to a greater degree and thus a possible source of dissolved carcinogens.  . 

===Snuff===. 
Users of [[snuff]] are believed to face less risk of some cancers than smokers, but are still at greater risk than people who do not use any tobacco products. <ref name="pmid18598931">{{cite journal |last1=Boffetta |first1=Paolo |last2=Hecht |first2=Stephen |last3=Gray |first3=Nigel |last4=Gupta |first4=Prakash |last5=Straif |first5=Kurt |title=Smokeless tobacco and cancer |journal=The Lancet Oncology |volume=9 |issue=7 |pages=667–75 |year=2008 |pmid=18598931 |doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(08)70173-6}}</ref> They also have an equal risk of other health problems directly linked to nicotine such as increased rate of [[atherosclerosis]].  . 

==History== . 

Concern about the health effects of tobacco has a long history. As early as 1604 '''[[James VI and I|James I]]''' wrote [[A Counterblaste to Tobacco]], in which he said that tobacco users were "harming your selves both in persons and goods" and the [[Word of Wisdom]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], written in 1833, prohibits the ingestion of tobacco thus: "...tobacco is not for the body, neither for the belly, and is not good for man, but is an herb for bruises and all sick cattle, to be used with judgment and skill." (Doctrine and Covenants 89:8).  . 

The late-19th century invention of automated cigarette-making machinery in the American South made possible mass production of cigarettes at low cost, and cigarettes became elegant and fashionable among society men as the Victorian era gave way to the Edwardian. In 1912, American Dr. Isaac Adler was the first to strongly suggest that lung [[cancer]] is related to smoking. <ref>{{cite book |first1=Isaac |last1=Adler |title=Primary Malignant Growth of the Lung and Bronchi |year=1912 |location=New York |publisher=Longmans, Green |pages=3–12}} Reprint: {{cite journal |last1=Adler |first1=I. A. |title=Primary Malignant Growths of the Lung |journal=CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=295–301 |year=1980 |doi=10.3322/canjclin.30.5.295}}</ref> In 1929, Fritz Lickint of [[Dresden]], [[Germany]], published a formal statistical evidence of a lung cancer-tobacco link, based on a study showing that [[lung cancer]] sufferers were likely to be smokers. <ref name=about_lickint>{{cite journal |last1=Proctor |first1=R. N |title=Commentary: Schairer and Schoniger's forgotten tobacco epidemiology and the Nazi quest for racial purity |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=31–34 |year=2001 |pmid=11171846 |doi=10.1093/ije/30.1.31}}</ref> Lickint also argued that tobacco use was the best way to explain the fact that lung cancer struck men four or five times more often than women (since women smoked much less). <ref name=about_lickint /> . 

Prior to World War I, lung cancer was considered to be a rare disease, which most physicians would never see during their career. <ref name="Cite pmid|11606795"/><ref>Adler I. Primary malignant growths of the lungs and bronchi. New York: Longmans, Green; 1912.{{Page needed|date=November 2010}}, cited in {{Cite doi|10.1164/rccm.200504-531OE}}</ref> With the postwar rise in popularity of cigarette smoking, however, came an epidemic of lung cancer.  . 

In 1950, [[Richard Doll]] published research in the ''[[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'' showing a close link between smoking and lung cancer. <ref name="Cite pmid|14772469"/> Four years later, in 1954, the [[British Doctors Study]], a study of some 40,000 doctors over 20 years, confirmed the suggestion, based on which the government issued advice that smoking and lung cancer rates were related. <ref>{{doi|10.1136/bmj.328.7455.1529}}</ref> The British Doctors Study lasted until 2001, with results published every ten years and final results published in 2004 by Doll and [[Richard Peto]]. <ref name="Doll2004">{{Cite pmid|15213107}}</ref> Much early research was also done by [[Alton Ochsner]]. [[Reader's Digest]] magazine for many years published frequent anti-smoking articles. In 1964, the United States [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]]'s [[Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the United States|Report on Smoking and Health]], led millions of American smokers to quit, the banning of certain advertising, and the requirement of warning labels on tobacco products.  . 

The Canadian province of [[British Columbia]] has the [[Tobacco Damages and Health Care Costs Recovery Act]].  .
