Smoking prevalence has changed little since the mid-1990s (until which time it declined in English-speaking countries, which have all implemented tobacco control). In Western countries, smoking is more prevalent among populations with [[mental disorder|mental health]] problems, with [[Alcoholism|alcohol]] and [[physical dependence|drug]] problems, among [[crime|criminal]]s, and among the [[Homelessness|homeless]]. <ref>{{cite book|author=West, Robert and Shiffman, Saul|title=Fast Facts: Smoking Cessation|publisher=Health Press Ltd.|year=2007|isbn=978-1-903734-98-8|pages=20, 26}}</ref> . 

As of 2002, about twenty percent of young teens (13–15) smoke worldwide. 80,000 to 100,000 children begin smoking every day. Half of those who begin smoking in [[adolescent]] years are projected to go on to smoke for 15 to 20 years. <ref name="WHO2002FactSheet">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wpro.who.int/media_centre/fact_sheets/fs_20020528.htm|title=WHO/WPRO-Smoking Statistics|accessdate=2009-01-01|author=|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|date=2002-05-28|year=|month=|work=|publisher=World Health Organization Regional Office for the Western Pacific|location=|pages=|language=|doi=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|quote=}}</ref> . 

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) states that "Much of the disease burden and premature mortality attributable to tobacco use disproportionately affect the poor". Of the 1.22 billion smokers, 1 billion of them live in developing or transitional economies. Rates of smoking have leveled off or declined in the [[developed world]]. <ref>{{Cite pmid|19910909}}</ref> In the [[developing world]], tobacco consumption is rising by 3.4% per year as of 2002;<ref name="WHO2002FactSheet"/> however, this figure could just be as high as the population growth.  .

Smoking rates in the United States have dropped by half from 1965 to 2006 falling from 42% to 20.8% of adults. <ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Cigarette smoking among adults—United States, 2006 |journal=MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. |volume=56 |issue=44 |pages=1157–61 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=17989644 |doi= |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5644a2.htm |quote=[http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5644a2.htm#fig Figure: Estimated percentage of persons ≥ 18 years who were current smokers, by sex] |author1= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}</ref>  . 

In 2005, it was estimated that 20.9% (or 45.1 million) of all U.S. adults were current cigarette smokers. Of them, 80.8% (or 36.5 million) smoked every day, and 19.2% (or 8.7 million) smoked some days. The prevalence of current cigarette smoking also varied substantially across population groups. For instance, current smoking was higher among men at 23.9% than women at 18.1%. This is consistent with other countries (see table). Among [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] and [[ethnic]] groups, [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] and [[Alaska Natives]] had the highest prevalence at 32.0%, followed by [[non-Hispanic whites]] at 21.9%, and non-Hispanic [[Black people|blacks]] at 21.5%. Asians at 13.3%, and Hispanics at 16.2% had the lowest rates. <ref name="CDC2005">[http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5542a1.htm Tobacco Use Among Adults: United States, 2005], [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], October 27, 2006</ref>  . 

Smoking prevalence also based on education level, with the highest among adults who had earned a [[General Educational Development]] (GED) [[diploma]] at 43.2% and those with 9–11 years of education at 32.6%. Prevalence generally decreased with increasing education. Adults aged 18–24 years were at 24.4% and 25–44 years were at 24.1% had the highest prevalences. The prevalence of current smoking was higher among adults living below the [[poverty line]] at 29.9% than among among those at or above the poverty line at 20.6%. <ref name="CDC2005"/> . 

In 2005, the CDC set a 2010 target of 12% for current cigarette smoking prevalence. Certain populations had already surpassed these when it was set. This included Hispanic (11.1%) and Asian (6.1%) women, women with [[undergraduate degree|undergraduate]] (9.6%) or [[graduate degree|graduate]] (7.4%) degrees, men with undergraduate (11.9%) or graduate (6.9%) degrees, men aged over 65 years (8.9%), and women aged over 65 years (8.3%). <ref name="CDC2005"/> . 

Among current cigarette smokers, an estimated 42.5% had stopped smoking for at least 1 day during the preceding 12 months because they were trying to quit. Among the estimated 42.5% (or 91.8 million) of people who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetimes (the question the CDC asked to measure if they were ever smokers or not), 50.8% (or 46.5 million) did not smoke currently. In 2005, prevalence of current [[cigar]] smoking was 2.2% and current [[smokeless tobacco]] use was 2.3%. Prevalence of cigar smoking and use of smokeless tobacco were higher among men (4.3% and 4.5%, respectively) than women (0.3% and 0.2%). <ref name="CDC2005"/> . 

There are large regional differences in smoking rates, with Kentucky, West Virginia, Oklahoma and Mississippi topping the list, and Idaho, California and Utah at significantly lower rates. <ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=State-specific prevalence of cigarette smoking among adults and quitting among persons aged 18-35 years—United States, 2006 |journal=[http://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/ MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep.] |volume=56 |issue=38 |pages=993–6 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17898692 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5638a2.htm |author1= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}</ref> However, declining rate has been offset each year with the addition of about one million new young American smokers. Females are making up a large amount of the American population who are increasing their consumption of tobacco, especially young, teenage girls. The American Tobacco Industry has been little affected by the overall declining rate of tobacco consumption. <ref>Nichter, M., and E. Cartwright. 1991 Saving the children for the tobacco industry.

The Health Survey for England in 2002 found a smoking rate of 26%. By 2007 the proportion of adult smokers in England had declined 4% to 22%. <ref name=" The Information Centre for Health and Social Care">[:http://www.ic.nhs.uk/statistics-and-data-collections/health-and-lifestyles-related-surveys/health-survey-for-england/health-survey-for-england-2007-latest-trends-%5Bns%5D Health Survey for England 2007: Latest Trends], the [[Information Centre for Health and Social Care]], December 2008</ref> Overall, the numbers of smokers in the UK in 2007 was estimated at 13.7 million. <ref name="BJGPref">{{cite journal |author=Simpson CR,Hippisley-Cox J, Sheikh A| title= Trends in the epidemiology of smoking recorded in UK general practice| journal=Brit J Gen Pract |volume=60 |issue=572 |pages=e121–e127| year=2010| doi= 10.3399/bjgp10X483544 |pmid=20202355 |pmc=2828860}}</ref> The rate of smoking amongst the most socioeconomically affluent patients was 14% in 2007 and 34% for the most deprived. <ref name="BJGPref "/> . 

=== Canada ===. 
In December 2002, [[Statistics Canada]] published a report on smoking prevalence from 1985-2001. In that report they found from 1985 to 1991, prevalence of "current smoking" (which they defined as daily smokers and occasional smokers) declined overall, for both sexes and all age groups except for those aged 15 to 24. Even larger declines occurred from 1991 to 2001. While current smoking prevalence for youths did not significantly change from 1985 to 1994-1995, there was a significant decrease of 6 percentage points from 1994-1995 to 2001 (from 28.5% to 22.5%).[[Province|Provincial]]ly, [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Quebec]], [[Ontario]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]], experienced most of their declines in current smoking prevalence from 1994-1995 onwards. All of the provinces experienced some level of declines over the entire 1985 to 2001 period. Declines in daily smoking prevalence occurred for both sexes and all age groups over the entire 17-year time span, although youth smoking did not start significantly declining until the mid-1990s. Overall, for daily cigarette consumption, smokers by 2001 had a significantly lower proportion of smoking 26 or more cigarettes daily compared with 1985 (14.0% to 5.8%). Most of the declines in the different sex or age groups occurred after 1991. At the same time however, smokers in 2001 had a significantly higher proportion of smoking 1 to 10 cigarettes daily compared with 1985 (18.6% to 31.1%). Most of the decline occurred after 1991. <ref name="STATSCAN">[http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/82f0077x/82f0077x2001001-eng.pdf Report on Smoking in Canada 1985 to 2001], [[Statistics Canada]], Health Statistics Division, December 2002</ref> As of 2008 the rate was estimated to be 18%, and declining. <ref>http://www.cancer.ca/canada-wide/prevention/quit%20smoking/canadian%20tobacco%20stats.aspx?sc_lang=en</ref> A 2011 survey estimates that 17% of Canadians smoke. <ref>http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2011/09/07/smoking-rate-survey.html</ref> . 

=== Israel ===. 
In Israel,<ref name="WHOISR">[http://www.who.int/infobase/reportviewer.aspx?rptcode=ALL&uncode=376&dm=8&surveycode=101391i4 Tobacco Use Introduction for Israel], [[World Health Organization]]</ref> smoking prevalence among males has remained relatively constant at 30% for the past 10 years (1994–2004). <ref name="Baron">Baron-Epel O.

In 2005, research has shown that Israeli youths have begun to use [[bidis]] and [[hookah]], as alternative methods of tobacco use. <ref name="Baron"/> In 1990, smoking was the cause of about 1,800 male deaths in Israel which was around 12% of all male deaths. <ref name="CDCI"/> Smoking has not been found to be significant cause of death among Israeli women. <ref name="CDCI">[http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/WHO/israel.htm Tobacco or Health: A Global Status Report], [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), accessed July 13, 2005 (site now down)</ref> The average number of cigarettes smoked per [[Israelis|Israeli]] stands at 2162 (6). <ref name="Baron"/> . 

There are several [[anti-tobacco use legislation]]s in effect. For instance, advertising is prohibited in youth publications and is forbidden on television and radio. <ref name="CDCI"/> in addition to substantial increases in tobacco taxes, although comparatively the prices are still among the lowest compared to all of the European countries. <ref name="CDCI"/> In addition, there is no minimum age requirement for buying tobacco products in Israel. <ref>[http://www.euro.who.int/Document/E80607.pdf WHO European Country Profiles on Tobacco Control 2003], [[World Health Organization]], accessed November 24, 2005</ref> . 

According to [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]], the smoking rate in the Israeli adult population in 2009 was 20.9%, down from 34% in 2000. <ref>http://www.jpost.com/HealthAndSci-Tech/Health/Article.aspx?id=181972</ref> . 

=== Australia ===. 
In Australia the incidence of smoking is in decline, with figures from 2004-5 showing 23% of the population to be current smokers, a decline of 2% compared to 1995. Among the indigenous population, the rate is much higher, with 51% of men and 49% of women reported being current daily smokers. Young adults are the most likely age group to smoke, with a marked decline in smoking rates with increasing age. The prevalence of smoking is strongly associated with socioeconomic disadvantage, with over double the rate in the most disadvantaged quintile of the population as compared to the least.

=== New Zealand ===. 
Tobacco consumption in New Zealand peaked in the mid 1970s when 60% of the population where smokers, by 2011 that number had fallen to 20% of the population, thanks due to stringent tobacco control laws which are amongst the world's strictest. However despite these laws, the number of smokers appears to be increasing as the global economy worsens and a recent spate of natural disasters have seen an increase in tobacco sales and although more males smoke than females, this gap is slowly narrowing. Tobacco consumption by [[Māori people|Maori]] remains disproportionately high despite having decreased over recent years thanks to television, internet, radio and print media anti-smoking advertising aimed at Maori. The high rate of Maori tobacco consumption has been described by many Maori health advocates and academics as a "cultural genocide" . 

=== Germany ===. 
In 2005, 27% of the population admitted to being current smokers. 23% were regular smokers (28% of men and 19% of women,) while 4% smoked irregularly. The highest ratio of regular smokers was in the 20-24 age group: 38% of men and 30% of women. <ref name="mikrozensus">{{cite web|url=http://www.destatis.de/jetspeed/portal/cms/Sites/destatis/Internet/DE/Presse/pk/2006/Mikrozensus/Pressebroschuere,property=file.pdf|title=Leben in Deutschland.
