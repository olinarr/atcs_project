==Controversy==. 
On March 1, 2010, the ''Wall Street Journal'' reported that proposed committee members Jack Henningfield and Neal L. Benowitz, had served as consultants to [[GlaxoSmithKline]], and Benowitz to [[Pfizer]] as well, both pharmaceutical firms that market [[smoking cessation]] drugs. <ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704358004575096023131826574.html FDA Tobacco Panel Includes Members With Quit-Smoking Ties], ''Wall Street Journal'', David Kesmodel and Jared A.

In February 2011, [[Lorillard]] and [[RJR|R.J. Reynolds]] filed a federal lawsuit to try to block the advisory committee action or force the FDA to disregard its advice, stating three of the eight panel members had financial conflicts of interest from legal and consulting work against tobacco companies. <ref name=BizJ>{{cite news|title=Lorillard suit accuses FDA panel of bias|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/triad/news/2011/02/25/lorillard-suit-accuses-fda-panel-of-bias.html|accessdate=27 July 2011|newspaper=The Business Journal|date=25 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=NYTDuff>{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Duff|title=Advisory Panel Urges F.D.A. to Re-examine Menthol in Cigarettes|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/19/business/19tobacco.html?_r=4|accessdate=27 July 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=18 March 2011}}</ref> . 

==TPSAC Decision on Menthol Cigarettes==. 
On March 18, 2011 the panel concluded that removing menthol cigarettes from the market would benefit public health in the United States, but stopped short of recommending that the FDA take any specific actions like restricting or banning the additive. A progress report on panel findings is expected in July 2011. <ref name=NYTDuff/> . 

In March 2011, the tobacco industry released a report to the FDA in response to the TPSAC decision claiming menthol cigarettes are no riskier than regular cigarettes and should not be regulated differently. <ref name=AP>{{cite news|title=Tobacco makers fight menthol rules|url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-03-18/business/29350721_1_menthol-tobacco-industry-tobacco-companies|accessdate=27 July 2011|newspaper=Associated Press|date=18 March 2011}}</ref>  . 

==TPSAC Interactive Public Docket==.
