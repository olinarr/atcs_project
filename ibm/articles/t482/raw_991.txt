The '''history of smoking''' dates back to as early as 5000 BC in shamanistic rituals. With the arrivals of the Europeans in the 16th century, the consumption, cultivation, and trading of tobacco quickly spread. With the modernization of farm equipment and manufacturing bore the cigarette following [[Reconstruction era of the United States|reconstruction]] in the United States. This method of consumption quickly expanded the scope of consumption, which grew until the scientific controversies of the 1960s, and condemnation in the 1980s.  . 

[[Cannabis smoking|Cannabis]] was common in the Middle East before the arrival of tobacco, and has been known to be in existence since 2000 BC. The early consumption of cannabis was a common social activity that centered around the type of water pipe called a [[hookah]].  . 

Previously eaten for its medicinal properties, [[opium]] smoking became widespread during the 19th century from British trade with China. This spawned the many infamous [[Opium dens]]. In the latter half of the century, opium smoking became popular in the artistic communities of Europe. While Opium dens continued to exist throughout the world, the trend among the Europeans abated during the first World War, and among the Chinese during the [[cultural revolution]].  . 

With the modernization of cigarette consumption compounded with the increased life expectancies during the 1920s, adverse health effects began to become more noticeable. In 1929, Fritz Lickint of Dresden, Germany, published  a formal statistical evidence of a lung cancer–tobacco link; which subsequently led the strong anti-smoking movement of Nazi Germany. The subject remained largely taboo until 1954 with the [[British Doctors Study]], and in 1964 United States Surgeon General's report. Tobacco became stigmatized, which led to the largest civil settlement in United States history, the [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement]] (MSA).  . 

In the early 1990s, smoked [[crack cocaine]] experiencing a new height in growth, which was likewise followed by [[Methamphetamine]], [[Phencyclidine]], and other substances.  .

Smoking has been practiced in one form or another since ancient times. Tobacco and various hallucinogenic drugs were smoked all over the Americas as early as 5000 BC in shamanistic rituals and originated in the Peruvian and Ecuadorian Andes. <ref>See Gately; Wilbert</ref> Many ancient civilizations, such as the [[Babylonians]], Indians and Chinese, burnt incense as a part of religious rituals, as did the [[Israelites]] and the later Catholic and [[Orthodox Christian]] churches. In [[Ancient Greece]], smoke was used as healing practice and the [[Oracle of Delphi]] made prophecies while intoxicated by inhaling natural gases from a natural bore hole. The Greek historian [[Herodotos]] also wrote that the [[Scythians]] used [[cannabis]] for ritual purposes and, to some degree, pleasure. He describes how Scythians burned hemp seed:
{{cquote|At once it begins to smoke, giving off a vapour unsurpassed by any vapour-bath one could find in Greece. The Scythians enjoy it so much that they howl with pleasure. <ref>Sander L. Gilman and Zhou Xun, "Introduction" in ''Smoke'', p. 12</ref>}}
[[File:Aztec feast 1.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Aztec women are handed flowers and smoking tubes before eating at a banquet, [[Florentine Codex]], 16th century.]]
Smoking in the Americas probably had its origins in the incense-burning ceremonies of [[shamanism|shamans]] but was later adopted for pleasure or as a social tool. <ref>Robicsek (1978), p. 30</ref> The [[Maya civilization|Maya]] employed it in classical times (at least from the 10th century) and the [[Aztecs]] included it in their mythology. The Aztec goddess Cihuacoahuatl had a body consisting of tobacco, and the priests that performed human sacrifices wore tobacco gourds as symbols of divinity. Even today certain Tzeltal Maya sacrifice 13 calabashes of tobacco at New Year. <ref>Francis Robicsek, "Ritual Smoking in Central America" in ''Smoke'', p. 33</ref> The smoking of tobacco and various other hallucinogenic drugs was used to achieve trances and to come into contact with the spirit world. Reports from the first European explorers and conquistadors to reach the Americas tell of rituals where native priests smoked themselves into such high degrees of intoxication that it is unlikely that the rituals were limited to just tobacco. No concrete evidence of exactly what was smoked exists, but the most probable theory is that the tobacco used was much stronger, consumed in extreme amounts or that it was mixed with any number of other, unknown, psychoactive drugs. [[File:MacoocheeMoundEffigyPipe.png|thumb|150px|left|A ceremonial pipe of the [[Mississippian Culture]].]]In North America the most common form of smoking was in pipes, which today are best known as the [[peace pipe]]s offered both to other tribes and later European settlers as a gesture of goodwill and diplomacy. In the Caribbean, Mexico and Central and South America, early forms of cigarettes, smoking reeds or cigars were the most common smoking tools. Only in modern times has the use of pipes become fairly widespread. Smoking is depicted in engravings and on various types of pottery as early as the 9th century, but it is not known whether it was limited to just the upper class and priests. <ref>Francis Robicsek, "Ritual Smoking in Central America" in ''Smoke'', p. 35</ref> . 

By the time Europeans arrived in the Americas in the late 15th century there was widespread use of tobacco smoking as a recreational activity. At the banquets of [[Aztec]] nobles, the meal would commence by passing out fragrant flowers and smoking tubes for the dinner guests. At the end of the feast, which would last all night, the remaining flowers, smoking tubes and food would be given as a kind of alms to old and poor people who had been invited to witness the social occasion, or it would be rewarded to the servants. <ref>Coe, pp. 74–81</ref> . 

== Introduction to the Old world == . 

[[File:Die truckene Trunkenheit.jpg|thumb|120px|right|An engraving from [[Jakob Balde]]'s ''Die truckene Trunkenheit'' ("The Dry Drunkenness") from 1658.]] . 

After the European exploration and subsequent [[European colonization of the Americas|colonization of the Americas]] in the 16th century, the smoking, cultivation and trading of [[tobacco]] quickly spread to all corners of the globe. By the mid-17th century every major civilization had been introduced to tobacco smoking and in many cases had already assimilated it into the native culture, despite the attempts of many rulers to stamp the practice out with harsh penalties or fines. Tobacco, both product and plant, followed the major trade routes to major ports and markets, and then on into the hinterlands. The English language term 'smoking' was coined in the late 17th century; until then it was referred to as 'drinking smoke'. <ref name="L&M">Lloyd & Mitchinson</ref> . 

Soon after its introduction to the Old World, tobacco came under frequent criticism from state and religious leaders. [[Murad IV]], sultan of the [[Ottoman Empire]] 1623-40 was among the first to attempt a smoking ban by claiming it was a threat to public moral and health. The Chinese emperor [[Chongzhen]] issued an edict banning smoking two years before his death and the overthrow of the [[Ming dynasty]]. Later, the [[Manchu]] of the [[Qing dynasty]], who were originally a tribe of nomadic horse warriors, would proclaim smoking "a more heinous crime than that even of neglecting archery". In [[Edo period]] Japan, some of the earliest tobacco plantations were scorned by the [[shogunate]] as being a threat to the military economy by letting valuable farmland go to waste for the use of a recreational drug instead of being used to plant food crops. <ref name = "Screech-Smoke">Timon Screech, "Tobacco in Edo Period Japan" in ''Smoke'', pp. 92-99</ref> Religious leaders have often been prominent among those who considered smoking immoral or outright blasphemous. In 1634 the [[Patriarch of Moscow]] forbade the sale of tobacco and sentenced men and women who flouted the ban to have their nostrils slit and their backs whipped until skin came off their backs. The Western church leader [[Urban VII]] likewise condemned smoking in a papal bull of 1642. Despite many concerted efforts, restrictions and bans were almost universally ignored. When [[James I of England]], a staunch anti-smoker and the author of a ''[[A Counterblaste to Tobacco]]'', tried to curb the new trend by enforcing a whopping 4000% tax increase on tobacco in 1604, it proved a failure, as London had some 7,000 tobacco sellers by the early 17th century. Later, scrupulous rulers would realise the futility of smoking bans and instead turned tobacco trade and cultivation into lucrative government monopolies. <ref>Sander Gilman and Zhou Xun, "Introduction" in ''Smoke'', p. 15-16</ref> .

A Frenchman named [[Jean Nicot]] (from whose name the word nicotine is derived) introduced tobacco to France in 1560. From France tobacco spread to England. The first report of a smoking Englishman is of a sailor in Bristol in 1556, seen "emitting smoke from his nostrils". <ref name="L&M"/> Like tea, coffee and opium, tobacco was just one of many intoxicants that was originally used as a form of medicine. <ref>Tanya Pollard, "The Pleasures and Perils of Smoking in Early Modern England" in ''Smoke'', p. 38</ref> Early modern European medical science was still to a great extent based on [[humorism]], the idea that everything had a specific humoral nature that varied between hot and cold, dry and moist. Tobacco was often seen as something that was beneficial in its heating and drying properties and was assigned an endless list of beneficial properties. The concept of ingesting substances in the form of smoke was also entirely new and was met with both astonishment and great skepticism by Europeans. The debate raged among priests, scientists and laymen whether tobacco was a bane or boon and both sides had powerful supporters. The English king [[James I of England|James I]] was one of the first outspoken skeptics and wrote ''[[A Counterblaste to Tobacco]]'', an unforgiving literary assault on what he believed was a menace to society. Though rife with, at times, irrelevant and partial arguments, it did address some of the health issues and pointed out the peculiar fact that tobacco was frequently assigned conflicting, and at times almost miraculous, properties:
{{cquote|It makes a man sober that was drunke. It refreshes a weary man, and yet makes a man hungry.

Cannabis smoking in India has been known at least since 2000 BC<ref>''Marihuana and medicine'', p. 3</ref> and is first mentioned in the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'' which dates back a few hundred years BC. Fumigation (''dhupa'') and fire offerings (''homa'') are prescribed in the [[Ayurveda]] for medical purposes and have been practiced for at least 3,000&nbsp;years while smoking, ''dhumrapana'' (literally "drinking smoke"), has been practiced for at least 2,000&nbsp;years. Fumigation and fire offerings have been performed with various substances, including clarified butter ([[ghee]]), fish offal, dried snake skins and various pastes molded around [[incense]] sticks and lit to spread the smoke over wide areas. The practice of inhaling smoke has been employed as a remedy for many different ailments and has not been limited to just cannabis, but also various plants and medicinal concoctions, and is also recommended to be performed daily to promote general health. Before modern times, smoking was done with [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|pipes]] with stems of various lengths or [[Chillum (pipe)|chillums]]. Today ''dhumapana'' has been replaced almost entirely with cigarette smoking, but both ''dhupa'' and ''homa'' are still practiced. [[Beedi]], a type of handrolled herbal cigarette consisting of cloves, ground betel nut, and tobacco, usually with rather low proportion of tobacco, are a modern descendant of the historical ''dhumapana''. <ref>P. Ram Manohar, "Smoking and Ayurvedic Medicine in India" in ''Smoke'', pp. 68–75</ref> . 

In [[Indonesia]], a specific type of cigarette which includes [[cloves]] called ''[[kretek]]'' was invented in the early 1880s as a way of delivering the therapeutic properties of clove oil, or [[eugenol]], to the lungs. It quickly became a popular cough remedy and in the early 20th century ''kretek'' began to be marketed as a pre-rolled cigarette (rather than being mixed and rolled by consumers). In the 1960s and 70s, ''kretek'' took on the form of a national symbol, with tax breaks compared to "white" cigarettes<ref>Website of US Embassy in Jakarta, [http://www.usembassyjakarta.org/econ/kretek.html JUNE 3, 1999: WHERE THERE'S SMOKE, THERE'S KRETEK: THE CIGARETTE INDUSTRY IN INDONESIA]. Accessed July 20, 2007. </ref> and the production began to shift from traditional hand-rolling to machine-rolling. The industrial method passed the hand-rolled type in numbers in the mid-1980s and today ''kretek'' dominates up to 90% of the Indonesian cigarette market. The production is one of the largest sources of income for the Indonesian government and the production, which is spread out on some 500 independent manufacturers, employs some 180,000 people directly and over 10&nbsp;million indirectly. <ref>Mark Hanusz, "A Century of Kretek" in ''Smoke'', pp. 140–143</ref> . 

=== The Middle East === . 

[[File:Persian girl smoking.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A Persian girl smoking by [[Muhammad Qasim]]. [[Isfahan]], 17th century.]] . 

[[Cannabis smoking]] was common in the Middle East before the arrival of tobacco, and was early on a common social activity that centered around the type of water pipe called a [[hookah]]. The pipes would often have several tubes from which more than one person could smoke at a time, or the nozzle would be passed around in the many smoking houses that functioned as social hubs in major centers of Muslim culture like [[Istanbul]], [[Baghdad]] and [[Cairo]]. Smoking, especially after the introduction of tobacco, was an essential component of Muslim society and culture and became integrated with important traditions like weddings, funerals and was expressed in architecture, clothing, literature and poetry. <ref>Sander L. Gilman and Zhou Xun, "Introduction" in ''Smoke'', p. 20–21</ref> . 

There is reference to tobacco in Persian poem dating from before 1536, but because of the lack of any corroborating sources, the authenticity of the source has been questioned. The next reliable eyewitness account of tobacco smoking is by a Spanish envoy in 1617, but by this time the practice was already deeply engrained in Persian society. The water pipe called ''qalyan'' (or hookah) most likely originated in India, but it was in [[Safavid dynasty]] Persia that it became a refined smoking tool. The pipes of the rich were made of finely crafted glass and precious metals while common people used coconuts with bamboo tubing, and these were used to smoke cannabis before the arrival of tobacco. The two substances in combination proved very popular and were also smoked in normal "dry" pipes, but the water pipe remained the most common smoking tool until the introduction of the cigarette in the 20th century. Foreign visitors to the region often remarked that smoking was immensely popular among Persians; on [[Ramadan]], the Muslim period of fasting when no food was to be eaten while the sun was up, among the first thing many Persians did after sunset was to light their pipes. Both sexes smoked, but for women it was a private affair enjoyed in the seclusion of private homes. In the 19th century Iran was one of the world's largest tobacco exporters and the habit had by then become something considered a national Iranian trait. <ref>Rudi Mathee, "Tobacco in Iran" in ''Smoke'', pp. 58–67</ref> .

After the European discovery of the Americas, tobacco was spread to Asia, first by Spanish and Portuguese sailors and later by the Dutch and English. Spain and Portugal were active in Central and South America, where cigarettes and cigars were the smoking tools of choice, and their sailors smoked mostly cigars. The English and Dutch had contact with the pipe smoking natives of North America, and took over their habits. While the southern Europeans began smoking earlier, it was the long-stemmed pipes of the northerners that became popular in East and Southeast Asia. Tobacco smoking arrived through expatriates in the Philippines and was introduced as early as the 1570s. <ref>Barnabas Tatsuya Suzuki, "Tobacco Culture in Japan" in  ''Smoke'', pp. 76–83</ref> . 

By the early 17th century the [[kiseru]], a long-stemmed Japanese pipe inspired by Dutch clay pipes, was common enough to be mentioned in Buddhist text books for children. The practice of tobacco smoking evolved as a part of the [[Japanese tea ceremony]] by employing many of the traditional object used to burn [[incense]] for tobacco smoking. The ''kō-bon'' (the incense tray) became the ''tabako-bon'', the incense burner evolved into a pot for tobacco embers and the incense pot became an ash tray.  . 

During the Edo period weapons were frequently used as objects with which one could flaunt ones wealth and social status. Since only [[samurai]] were allowed to carry weapons, an elaborate kiseru slung from the waist would serve a similar purpose. After the Meiji restoration and the abolishment of the caste system, many craftsmen who previously had worked on decorating swords moved on to designing kiserus and buckles for tobacco pouches. Though mass-production of cigarettes began in the late 19th century, it was not until after World War II that the kiseru went of out style and became an object of tradition and relative obscurity. <ref name = "Screech-Smoke"/> .

Cannabis smoking was introduced to [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] through [[Ethiopia]] and the east African coast by either Indian or Arab traders in the 13th century or earlier and spread on the same trade routes as those that carried coffee, which originated in the highlands of Ethiopia. <ref>Phillips, pp. 303–319</ref> It was smoked in [[calabash]] water pipes with [[terra cotta]] smoking bowls, apparently an Ethiopian invention which was later conveyed to eastern, southern and central Africa. Tobacco was introduced around 1600 by French merchants in what today is modern-day [[Gambia]] and [[Senegal]]. At the same time caravans from [[Morocco]] brought tobacco to the areas around [[Timbuktu]] and the Portuguese brought the commodity (and the plant) to southern Africa, establishing the popularity of tobacco throughout all of Africa by the 1650s. Both imported tobacco and tobacco pipes became prized and valuable trading goods and were both quickly absorbed into African cultural traditions, rituals and politics. A rich artistic tradition of decorated pipes of wood, ceramics and, eventually, metal developed and spawned an endless variety of themes and motifs of all shapes and sizes.  . 

Tobacco and cannabis were used, much like elsewhere in the world, to confirm social relations, but also created entirely new ones. In what is today [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], a society called [[Bena Diemba]] ("People of Cannabis") was organized in the late 19th century in Lubuko ("The Land of Friendship"). The Bena Diemba were collectivist pacifists that rejected alcohol and herbal medicines in favor of cannabis. <ref>Allen F. Roberts, "Smoking in Sub-Saharan Africa" in ''Smoke'', pp. 53–54</ref> Certain other herbs have been and still are smoked by certain African communities. [[Tabwa]] shamans smoke ''lubowe'' (''[[Amaranthus dubius]]''), a plant that is said to aid in the shamans in seeing invisible spirit sorcerer, even though there are no reports of the substance being hallucinogenic.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Some groups, such as the [[Fang people|Fang]] of [[Gabon]] consume ''eboga'' (''[[Tabernanthe iboga]]''), a mind-altering drug in religious rituals. In modern Africa, smoking is in most areas considered to be modern and an expression of modernity, and many of the strong adverse opinions that prevail in the West receive much less attention. <ref>Allen F. Roberts, "Smoking in Sub-Saharan Africa" in ''Smoke'', pp. 46–57</ref> .

[[File:French opium den.jpg|thumb|150px|An illustration of an [[opium den]] on the cover of ''[[Le Petit Journal]]'', July 5, 1903.]] . 

In the 19th century the practice of smoking opium became common. Previously it had only been eaten, and then primarily for its medical properties. A massive increase in opium smoking in China was more or less directly instigated by the British trade deficit with [[Qing dynasty]] China. As a way to amend this problem, the British began exporting large amounts of opium grown in the Indian colonies. The social problems and the large net loss of currency led to several Chinese attempts to stop the imports which eventually culminated in the [[Opium Wars]]. Opium smoking later spread with Chinese immigrants and spawned many infamous [[opium den]]s in [[China town]]s around South and Southeast Asia and Europe. In the latter half of the 19th century, opium smoking became popular in the artistic community in Europe, especially Paris in artists' neighborhoods such as and [[Montparnasse]] and [[Montmartre]] being virtual "opium capitals". While opium dens that catered primarily to emigrant Chinese continued to exist in [[China Town]]s around the world, the trend among the European artists largely abated after the outbreak of World War I. <ref>Jos Ten Berge, "The ''Belle Epoque'' of Opium"in ''Smoke'', p. 114</ref> . 

== Social stigma ==. 
=== Early opposition === . 

Ever since smoking was introduced outside of the Americas, there has been much vehement opposition to it. Arguments had ranged from socio-economic ones, with tobacco being considered a usurper of good farm land, to purely moralistic ones, where many religiously devout individuals saw tobacco as merely another form of immoral intoxication. Many arguments were presented to the effect that smoking was harmful, and even if the critics were in the end right about many of their claims, the complaints were usually not based on scientific arguments, and if they were, these often relied on [[four humors|humorism]] and other pre-modern scientific methods. Dr Eleazar Duncon, 1606, wrote <ref>In a letter discovered in c.2009 by Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (RCPE) librarians, http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/uk/Doctor39s-400yearold-letter-strikes-chord.5662844.jp</ref> that tobacco "is so hurtful and dangerous to youth that it might have the pernicious nation expressed in the name, and that it were as well known by the name of Youths-bane as by the name of tobacco". Early 17th century descriptive notices of various characteristic types and fashions of men  portray tobacconists and smokers as individuals who suffer from false self-images and mistaken illusions about the properties of tobacco taking. <ref>17th century books of characters. ''[http://www.presscom.co.uk/halliwell/characters/characters.html . See Halliwell]''</ref>  Although physicians such as [[Benjamin Rush]] had claimed tobacco use (including smoking) negatively impacted one's health in  1798,<ref>Goldberg, p. 147</ref> it was not until the early 20th century that serious medical studies began to be conducted.  .

The late-19th century invention of automated cigarette-making machinery in the American South made possible mass production of cigarettes at low cost, and cigarettes became elegant and fashionable among society men as the Victorian era gave way to the Edwardian. In 1912, American Dr. Isaac Adler was the first to strongly suggest that [[lung cancer]] is related to smoking. <ref>Isaac Adler. "Primary Malignant Growth of the Lung and Bronchi". (1912) New York, Longmans, Green. pp. 3-12. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/canjclin.30.5.295/abstract Reprinted (1980)] by ''A Cancer Journal for Clinicians''</ref> . 

Prior to World War I, lung cancer was considered to be a rare disease, which most physicians would never see during their career. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Witschi |title=A Short History of Lung Cancer |journal=Toxicol Sci |month=November | year=2001|volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=4–6 |pmid=11606795 |ref=harv |postscript=. |doi=10.1093/toxsci/64.1.4}}</ref><ref>Adler I.

In 1929, Fritz Lickint of [[Dresden]], [[Germany]], published a formal statistical evidence of a lung cancer–tobacco link, based on a study showing that lung cancer sufferers were likely to be smokers. <ref name=about_lickint>[http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/30/1/31 Commentary: Schairer and Schoniger's forgotten tobacco epidemiology and the Nazi quest for racial purity - Proctor 30 (1): 31 - International Journal of Epidemiology]</ref> Lickint also argued that tobacco use was the best way to explain the fact that lung cancer struck men four or five times more often than women (since women smoked much less). <ref name=about_lickint /> . 

In Germany, anti-smoking groups, often associated with anti-liquor groups,<ref name="NWC178">{{Harvnb|Proctor|1999|p=178}}</ref> these groups first published advocacy against the consumption of tobacco in the journal ''Der Tabakgegner'' (The Tobacco Opponent), by the Bohemian organization between 1912 and 1932. The ''Deutsche Tabakgegner'' (German Tobacco Opponents) was published in Dresden from 1919 to 1935, and was the second journal on this subject. <ref name="NWC177">{{Harvnb|Proctor|1999|p=177}}</ref> . 

With the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] during the great depression, he condemned his earlier smoking habit as a waste of money. <ref name="NWC219"/> In later years, Hitler viewed smoking as "decadent"<ref name="HRCPL1374">{{Harvnb|Clark|Briggs|Cooke|2005|Ref=CITEREFClarkBriggsCooke2005|p=1374}}</ref> and "the wrath of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Red Man]] against the White Man, vengeance for having been given [[hard liquor]]",<ref name="NWC219">{{Harvnb|Proctor|1999|p=219}}</ref> lamenting that "so many excellent men have been lost to tobacco poisoning". <ref name="NWC173">{{Harvnb|Proctor|1999|p=173}}</ref> Nazi reproductive policy likewise strengthened the anti-smoking movement.

The political resistance from Nazi Germany did not effectively reach across enemy lines during the Second World War. <!--LEFT OFF HERE--> One of the true breakthroughs came in 1948, when the British physiologist [[Richard Doll]] published the first major studies that proved that smoking could cause serious health damage. <ref>Sander L.

In 1964 the [[Surgeon General of the United States|United States Surgeon General]]'s Report on Smoking and Health, began the font suggesting the link between smoking and cancer. This eventually led to banning of certain advertising, and the requirement of warning labels on tobacco products. In some countries with increased taxes, restrictions on [[list of smoking bans|where to smoke]] and anti-smoking advertising there has been a reaction through [[smoker's rights|smoking defense groups]] since the 1990s. These groups feel that new regulations and the general atmosphere are oppressive and the stigmatization placed on them has crossed lines not seen before.  Some smoking defense groups are independent,<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20091027005941/http://geocities.com/~msrc/ Minnesota FORCES - example of independent smoker's rights group</ref> while others are funded by tobacco companies. <ref>https://mysmokersrights.rjrt.com/SGRHome.jsp R.J.

{{For|more about the rise in consumption in the 1980s|Crack epidemic (United States)}} . 

In the early 1980s, the majority of [[cocaine]] being shipped to the United States, landing in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], was coming through the [[Bahamas]]. However, overproduction of cocaine powder in these islands caused the price to drop by as much as 80 percent. Compounded with dropping prices for their illegal product, [[drug dealer]]s made a decision to convert the powder to "crack," a solid smokeable form of cocaine, that could be sold in smaller quantities, to more people. It was cheap, simple to produce, ready to use, and highly profitable for dealers to develop. As early as 1980, reports of crack were appearing in Los Angeles, [[San Diego]], [[Houston]], and in the [[Caribbean]]. <ref name=CrackDEA85>"[[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] History Book, 1876 - 1990 (drug usage & enforcement), [[US Department of Justice]], 1991, USDoJ.gov webpage: [http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/history/1985-1990.html DoJ-DEA-History-1985-1990]. </ref> . 

This growth in popularity abated in the late 1990s. Described by a criminologist [[Alfred Blumstein]] this change was resulted from four factors: tighter gun restrictions in areas where crack cocaine is prevalent, a shrinking market and its institutionalization, the robustness of the economy, and the availability of jobs. <ref name=End>[http://www.salon.com/news/feature/1999/05/11/crack_media/index1.html]. </ref> .
