An '''agricultural subsidy''' is a governmental [[subsidy]] paid to [[farmer]]s and [[agribusiness]]es to supplement their income, manage the supply of agricultural [[commodity|commodities]], and influence the cost and supply of such commodities. Examples of such commodities include [[wheat]], [[feed grains]] ([[cereal|grain]] used as [[fodder]], such as [[maize]] or corn, [[sorghum]], [[barley]], and [[oat]]s), [[cotton]], [[milk]], [[rice]], [[peanut]]s, [[sugar]], [[tobacco]], and [[oilseed]]s such as [[soybean]]s.  . 

==Agricultural subsidies by region==. 
=== European Union ===. 
{{Main|Common Agricultural Policy}}
{{See also|Intervention storage}} . 

In 2010, the EU spent €57 billion on agricultural development, of which €39 billion was spent on direct subsidies. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/budget/data/D2010_VOL4/EN/nmc-titleN123A5/index.html|accessdate=2011-01-01|title=Title 05 — Agriculture and rural development}}</ref> Agricultural and fisheries subsidies form over 40% of the EU budget. <ref>http://ec.europa.eu/budget/budget_glance/what_for_en.htm</ref> Since 1992 (and especially since 2005), the EU's Common Agricultural Policy has undergone significant change as subsidies have mostly been decoupled from production. The largest subsidy is the ''[[Single Farm Payment]]''.  . 

=== Africa ===. 
Increases in food and fertilizer prices have underlined the vulnerability of poor urban and rural households in many developing countries, especially in Africa, renewing policymakers' focus on the need to increase staple food crop productivity.  . 

A study by the [[Overseas Development Institute]] evaluates the benefits of the Malawi Government Agricultural Inputs Subsidy Programme, which was implemented in 2006/2007 to promote access to and use of fertilizers in both maize and tobacco production to increase agricultural productivity and food security. The subsidy was implemented by means of a coupon system which could be redeemed by the recipients for [[Fertilizer_Subsidies_in_Sub_Saharan_Africa#Input_vouchers|fertilizer]] types at approximately one-third of the normal cash price. <ref name=malawi/> According to policy conclusions of the [[Overseas Development Institute]] the voucher for coupon system can be an effective way of rationing and targeting subsidy access to maximize production and economic and social gains. Many practical and political challenges remain in the program design and implementation required to increase efficiency, control costs, and limit patronage and fraud. <ref name=malawi>{{cite web|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2464&title=towards-smart-subsidies-agriculture-lessons-recent-malawi|title=Towards 'smart' subsidies in agriculture?

===New Zealand===. 
[[New Zealand]] is reputed to have the most open agricultural markets in the world<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3411 |title=Save the Farms -- End the Subsidies |accessdate=2008-10-22 |quote=In 1984 New Zealand's Labor government took the dramatic step of ending all farm subsidies, which then consisted of 30 separate production payments and export incentives. This was a truly striking policy action, because New Zealand's economy is roughly five times more dependent on farming than is the U.S. economy, measured by either output or employment. Subsidies in New Zealand accounted for more than 30 percent of the value of production before reform, somewhat higher than U.S. subsidies today. And New Zealand farming was marred by the same problems caused by U.S. subsidies, including overproduction, environmental degradation and inflated land prices. |publisher=[[Cato Institute]] | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081025124712/http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3411| archivedate= 25 October 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/02/business/worldbusiness/02farm.html "Surviving with out subsidies", NYT]</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/3747430.stm "New Zealand's hardy farm spirit", BBC]</ref> after radical reforms started in 1984 by the [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fourth Labour Government]] all subsidies were stopped.

{{See also|Agricultural policy of the United States|Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008}}
The United States currently pays around $20 billion per year to farmers in direct subsidies as "farm income stabilization"<ref>[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/USbudget/fy10/sheets/hist03z2.xls]</ref><ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2006/07/02/GR2006070200024.html ''"Farm Subsidies Over Time"'', New York Times]</ref><ref>[http://www.ers.usda.gov/briefing/farmincome/govtpaybyfarmtype.htm ''"Farm Income and Costs: Farms Receiving Government Payments"''. USDA]</ref> via [[U.S. farm bill]]s. These bills pre-date  the economic turmoil of the [[Great Depression]] with the 1922 [[Grain Futures Act]], the 1929 [[Agricultural Marketing Act]] and the 1933 [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]] creating a tradition of government support.   . 

The beneficiaries of the subsidies have changed as [[agriculture in the United States]] has changed.  In the 1930s, about 25% of the country's population resided on the nation's 6,000,000 small farms.  By 1997, 157,000 large farms accounted for 72% of farm sales, with only 2% of the U.S. population residing on farms.  In 2006, the top 3 states receiving subsidies were Texas (10.4%), Iowa (9.0%), and Illinois (7.6%).  The Total USDA Subsidies from farms in Iowa totaled $1,212,000,000 in 2006. <ref name="farm.ewg.org">http://farm.ewg.org</ref>  From 2003 to 2005 the top 1% of beneficiaries received 17% of subsidy payments. <ref name="farm.ewg.org"/>  In Texas, 72% of farms do not receive government subsidies.  Of the close to $1.4 Billion in subsidy payments to farms in Texas, roughly 18% of the farms receive a portion of the payments. <ref>http://farm.ewg.org/farm/regionsummary.php?fips=48000</ref> . 

"Direct payment subsidies are provided without regard to the economic need of the recipients or the financial condition of the farm economy.  Established in 1996, direct payments were originally meant to wean farmers off traditional subsidies that are triggered during periods of low prices for corn, wheat, soybeans, cotton, rice, and other crops."<ref name="ReferenceA">http://farm.ewg.org/farm/dp_text.php</ref> . 

Top states for direct payments were Iowa ($501 million), Illinois ($454 million), and Texas ($397 million).  Direct payments  of subsidies are limited to $40,000 per person or $80,000 per couple. <ref name="ReferenceA"/> . 

The subsidy programs give farmers extra money for their crops and guarantee a [[price floor]].  For instance in the [[Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002|2002 Farm Bill]], for every bushel of wheat sold, farmers were paid an extra 52 cents and guaranteed a price of 3.86 from 2002–03 and 3.92 from 2004–2007. <ref name='The_2002_Farm_Bill'>{{cite web

[[maize|Corn]] is the top crop for subsidy payments. The [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] mandates that billions of gallons of ethanol be blended into vehicle fuel each year, guaranteeing demand, but US corn ethanol subsidies are between $5.5 billion and $7.3 billion per year. Producers also benefitted from a federal subsidy of 51 cents per gallon, additional state subsidies, and federal crop subsidies that can bring the total to 85 cents per gallon or more.  However, the federal ethanol subsidy expired December 31, 2011. <ref>Sweet, William. "Corn-o-Copia."  IEEE Spectrum.

==Impact of subsidies==. 
Farm subsidies have the direct effect of transferring income from the general tax payers to farm owners.  The justification for this transfer and its effects are complex and often controversial.  . 

===Global food prices and international trade===. 
Although some critics and proponents of the [[World Trade Organization]] have noted that export subsidies, by driving down the price of commodities, can provide cheap food for consumers in developing countries,<ref>{{cite web

  | accessdate =  }}</ref> low prices are harmful to farmers not receiving the subsidy.  Because it is usually wealthy countries that can afford domestic subsidies, critics argue that they promote [[poverty]] in [[developing country|developing countries]] by artificially driving down world crop prices. <ref>{{cite web | author = Andrew Cassel| title = Why U.S. Farm Subsidies Are Bad for the World | publisher = Philadelphia Inquirer| date = 2002-05-06 | url = http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0506-09.htm | accessdate = 2007-07-20| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070609232802/http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0506-09.htm| archivedate= 9 June 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Agriculture is one of the few areas where developing countries have a [[comparative advantage]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}, but low crop prices encourage developing countries to be dependent buyers of food from wealthy countries. So local farmers, instead of improving the agricultural and economic self-sufficiency of their home country, are instead forced out of the market and perhaps even off their land. This occurs as a result of a process known as "international dumping" in which subsidized farmers are able to "dump" low-cost agricultural goods on foreign markets at costs that un-subsidized farmers cannot compete with. Agricultural subsidies often are a common stumbling block in trade negotiations.  In 2006, talks at the [[Doha round]] of WTO trade negotiations stalled because the US refused to cut subsidies to a level where other countries' non-subsidized exports would have been competitive. <ref>{{cite web | coauthors = Alan Beattie and Frances Williams | title = US blamed as Trade Talks end in acrimony | publisher = Financial Times | date = 2006-07-24 | url =http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/dfa460d0-1afd-11db-b164-0000779e2340.html | accessdate = 2008-05-18}}</ref> . 

Others argue that a world market with farm subsidies and other [[market distortion]]s (as happens today) results in higher food prices, rather than lower food prices, as compared to a free market.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} . 

[[Mark Malloch Brown]], former head of the United Nations Development Program, estimated that farm subsidies cost poor countries about US$50 billion a year in lost agricultural exports: . 

<blockquote>
"It is the extraordinary distortion of global trade, where the West spends $360 billion a year on protecting its agriculture with a network of subsidies and tariffs that costs developing countries about US$50 billion in potential lost agricultural exports. Fifty billion dollars is the equivalent of today's level of development assistance."<ref>[http://content.undp.org/go/newsroom/2002/november/mmb-uganda.en;jsessionid=axbWzt8vXD9] Address by Mark Malloch Brown, UNDP Administrator, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda, 12 November 2002</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/05/opinion/05KRIS.html?ex=1027081396&ei=1&en=6415bc0232476bf2] "Farm Subsidies That Kill", July 5, 2002, By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, New York Times
</ref>
</blockquote> . 

===Poverty in Developing Countries===. 
The impact of agricultural subsidies in developed countries upon developing-country farmers and [[international development]] is well documented. Agricultural subsidies depress world prices and mean that unsubsidised developing-country farmers cannot compete; and the effects on poverty are particularly negative when subsidies are provided for crops that are also grown in developing countries since developing-country farmers must then compete directly with subsidised developed-country farmers, for example in cotton and sugar. <ref name="boxes">[http://ictsd.org/downloads/2009/10/green-box-web-1.pdf Agricultural Subsidies in the WTO Green Box], [[ICTSD]], September 2009. </ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Agricultural Subsidies, Poverty and the Environment | publisher = World Resources Institute | date = January 2007 | url =http://pdf.wri.org/aspe_domestic_reform.pdf | accessdate = 2011-02-25}}</ref>  The [[IFPRI]] has estimated in 2003 that the impact of subsidies costs developing countries $24Bn in lost incomes going to agricultural and agro-industrial production; and more than $40Bn is displaced from net agricultural exports. <ref>{{cite web | title = How much does it hurt? The Impact of Agricultural Trade Policies on Developing Countries| publisher = IFPRI | year = 2003 | url = http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/pubs/media/trade/trade.pdf | accessdate = 2011-02-25}}</ref>  Moreover the same study found that the [[Least Developed Countries]] have a higher proportion of GDP dependent upon agriculture, at around 36.7%, thus may be even more vulnerable to the effects of subsidies.  It has been argued that subsidised agriculture in the developed world is one of the greatest obstacles to economic growth in the developing world; which has an indirect impact on reducing the income available to invest in rural infrastructure such as health, safe water supplies and electricity for the rural poor. <ref>{{cite web | title= Farm subsidies: devastating the world's poor and the Eenvironment | url = http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba547 | accessdate = 2011-02-25}}</ref>  The total amount of subsidies that go towards agriculture in OECD countries far exceeds the amount that countries provide in [[development aid]].  . 

==== Haiti and US Rice Imports ==== . 

Haiti is an excellent example of a developing country negatively affected by agricultural subsidies in the developed world. Haiti is a nation with the capacity to produce rice and was at one time self-sufficient in meeting its own needs. [http://www1.american.edu/TED/haitirice.htm#endnote11]  [http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/28350/56025477.pdf?sequence=1] At present, Haiti does not produce enough to feed its people; 60 percent of the food consumed in the country is imported. [http://www.ifad.org/operations/projects/regions/pl/factsheet/haiti_e.pdf] Following advice to liberalize its economy by lowering tariffs, domestically produced rice was displaced by cheaper subsidised rice from the United States. The Food and Agriculture Organization describes this liberalization process as being the removal of barriers to trade and a simplification of tariffs, which lowers costs to consumers and promotes efficiency among producers. [http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y4671e/y4671e08.htm#fnB52] . 

Opening up Haiti's economy granted consumers access to food at a lower cost; allowing foreign producers to compete for the Haitian market drove down the price of rice. However, for Haitian rice farmers without access to subsidies, the downward pressure on prices led to a decline in profits. Subsidies received by American rice farmers made made it impossible for their Haitian counterparts to compete.[http://search.proquest.com/docview/305170611/fulltextPDF?accountid=14656][http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/osgdp20053_en.pdf] According to Oxfam and the International Monetary Fund, tariffs on imports fell from 50 percent to three percent in 1995 and the nation is currently importing 80 percent of the rice it consumes.[http://www.oxfam.org/development/haiti-no-longer-grows-much-its-own-rice-and-families-now-go-hungry] [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2001/cr0104.pdf] . 

The United States Department of Agriculture notes that since 1980, rice production in Haiti has been largely unchanged, while consumption on the other hand, is roughly eight times what it was in that same year. [http://gain.fas.usda.gov/Recent%20GAIN%20Publications/Rice%20Production%20and%20Trade%20Update_Santo%20Domingo_Haiti_11-9-2010.pdf] Haiti is among the top three consumers of long grain milled rice produced in the United States. [http://ers.usda.gov/Briefing/Rice/SpecialArticle/USricemarket.pdf]  . 

As rice farmers struggled to compete, many migrated from rural to urban areas in search of alternative economic opportunities.[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11472874] . 

===Impact on nutrition===. 
Peer-reviewed research suggests that any effects of U.S. farm policies on U.S. obesity patterns must have been negligible. <ref>[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VCB-4T0NGJ3-3&_user=5731894&_coverDate=12%2F31%2F2008&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=gateway&_origin=gateway&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_searchStrId=1726424888&_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&_acct=C000043105&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=5731894&md5=a573e36657175784a01a7e9ba386f0fb&searchtype=a Farm subsidies and obesity in the United States: National evidence and international comparisons]</ref> However, some critics argue that the artificially low prices resulting from subsidies create unhealthy incentives for consumers. For example, in the USA, [[cane sugar]] has been replaced with cheap [[corn syrup]], making high-sugar food cheaper;<ref>{{cite web |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE2D61E3CF931A25753C1A9659C8B63&sec=health|title=  THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 10-12-03; The (Agri)Cultural Contradictions Of Obesity|accessdate=2008-04-29 |publisher= ''The New York Times''|author= Pollan, Michael| date=2003-10-12| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080502064130/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE2D61E3CF931A25753C1A9659C8B63&sec=health| archivedate= 2 May 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> beet and cane sugar are subject to subsidies, price controls, and import tariffs that distort the prices of these products as well.  . 

Market distortions due to subsidies have led to an increase in corn fed cattle rather than grass fed. <ref name=corn/> Corn fed cattle require more antibiotics and their beef has a higher fat content. <ref name=corn>{{cite web |url= http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200305/kummer|title= Back To Grass|accessdate=2008-04-29 |publisher= ''The Atlantic''|author= Kummer, Corby| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080516174706/http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200305/kummer| archivedate= 16 May 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> . 

=== Cross-border movement of businesses ===. 
Tariffs on sugar have also caused large candymakers in the USA to relocate to Canada and Mexico, where sugar is often half to a third the price. <ref name=sugartarifs>{{cite web |url= http://reclaimdemocracy.org/articles_2005/sugar_industry_subsidies.php|title=The Sugar Industry and Corporate Welfare}}</ref> . 

===Non-farming companies===. 
Subsidies are also given to companies and individuals with little connection to traditional farming. It has been reported that the largest part of the sum given to these companies flow to multinational companies like food conglomerates, sugar manufacturers and liquor distillers. For example in France, the single largest beneficiary was the chicken processor [[Groupe Doux]], at €62.8m, and was followed by about a dozen sugar manufacturers which together reaped more than €103m.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} . 

===Public Economics Implications===. 
Government intervention, through agricultural subsidies, interferes with the price mechanism which would normally determine commodity prices, often creating crop overproduction and market discrimination. Subsidies are also an inefficient use of taxpayer’s money. For instance, in 2006, the Department of Agriculture estimated that the average farm household income was $77,654 or about 17% higher than the average U.S. household income. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Wyatt|coauthors=Mishra Ashok, Joe Dewbre|title=Farm Household Income and Transfer Efficiency: An Evaluation of United States Farm Program Payments|journal=American Journal of Agricultural Economics|date=15|year=2009|month=September|volume=91.5|pages=1926-1301}}</ref> From a public economics perspective, subsidies of any kind work to create a socially and politically acceptable equilibrium that is not necessarily Pareto Efficient. <ref>{{cite book|last=Rosen|first=Harvey|title=Public Finance|year=2008|publisher=McGraw-Hill Irwin|location=New York|pages=83–84}}</ref> . 

==Alternatives==. 
The current subsidies distort incentives for the global trade of agricultural commodities in which other countries may have a comparative advantage. Allowing countries to specialize in commodities in which they have a comparative advantage in and then freely trade across borders would therefore increase global welfare and reduce food prices. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Kym|coauthors=Will Martin|title=Agricultural Trade Reform and the Doha Development Agenda|journal=The World Economy|date=13|year=2005|month=September|volume=28|issue=9|pages=1301–1327}}</ref> Ending direct payments to farmers and deregulating the farm industry would eliminate inefficiencies and deadweight loss created by government intervention.  .
