The '''Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act''', ({{USPL|111|31}}, {{USBill|111|H.R.|1256}}) is a [[Law of the United States#Federal law|federal statute]] in the [[United States]] that was signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] on June 22, 2009. The Act gives the [[Food and Drug Administration]] the power to regulate the [[tobacco industry]]. A signature element of the law imposes new warnings and labels on tobacco packaging and their advertisements, with the goal of discouraging minors and young adults from smoking. The Act also bans flavored cigarettes, places limits on the advertising of tobacco products to minors and requires tobacco companies to seek FDA approval for new tobacco products.  . 

==Origins and proposal==. 
On March 21, 2000, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.]]'' held that based on their reading of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]], particularly when considering "Congress’ subsequent tobacco-specific legislation," that Congress had not given the FDA the authority to [[Regulation of tobacco by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration|regulate tobacco products]] as customarily marketed. <ref>[http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/98-1152.ZS.html FDA V. BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.]</ref>  Thus the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act was introduced to respond to the decision, which had held that the Clinton administration's FDA had "overreached" its Congressionally delegated authority, thus giving the FDA the authority the Court determined it had lacked. <ref>[http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/tobacco-bill-clears-senate-by-wide-margin-2009-06-11.html TheHill.com - Tobacco bill clears Senate by wide margin]</ref> .

The Capitol Hill newspaper ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' reported on May 25, 2009, that [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid|Reid]] planned to move on the bill during the month of June 2009; however it noted that Senators [[Richard Burr|Burr]] and [[Kay Hagan|Hagan]] of [[North Carolina]] were proposing alternative legislation. <ref name=Rushing/> . 

On June 2, the Senate voted 84-11 to proceed to consideration of the House bill. <ref>{{cite web

Media accounts noted that the opposition in the Senate was largely from tobacco farming states, particularly Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, with the only Democrat in opposition being [[Kay Hagan]], from North Carolina. Notable exceptions were Virginia Senators [[Jim Webb]] and [[Mark Warner]] who supported the measure, despite the state's connection to the tobacco industry. <ref>{{cite news| url= http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/06/11/senate-passes-bill-increasing-fda-power-to-regulate-tobacco-products/ | work=CNN Political Ticker: Blog Archive | title=Senate passes bill increasing FDA power to regulate tobacco| date=June 11, 2009}}</ref> . 

The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act was signed into law on June 22, 2009, by President [[Barack Obama]].  . 

==Provisions==. 
*Creates a tobacco control center within the FDA and gives the FDA authority to regulate the content, marketing and sale of tobacco products. 
*Requires tobacco companies and importers to reveal all product ingredients and seek FDA approval for any new tobacco products. 
*Allows the FDA to change tobacco product content. 
**The ban on flavoring applies to any product meeting the definition of a "cigarette" according to section 3(1) of the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act. This includes any tobacco that comes rolled such as cigarettes and cigars, and added to this definition in the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act is any tobacco with the purpose to be rolled such as rolling tobacco. 
*Calls for new rules to prevent sales except through direct, face-to-face exchanges between a retailer and a consumer. 
*Limits advertising that could attract young smokers. 
*Requires cigarette warning labels to cover 50 percent of the front and rear of each pack, with the word ''warning'' in capital letters. 
*Requires FDA approval for the use of expressions such as "light, "mild" or "low" that give the impression that a particular tobacco product poses less of a health risk. <ref>http://seekingalpha.com/article/71496-fda-tobacco-bill-prevents-ban-forces-them-to-endorse-it</ref>
The bill makes no provisions that ban the import of the banned items for personal consumption, only for "sale or distribution". (Division A Title II Section 201) <ref>http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-1256&tab=summary</ref> . 

==Reception and impact==. 
Passage of the law was supported by the [[American Cancer Society]], whose CEO noted in a press release that "[t]his bill forces Big Tobacco to disclose the poisons in its products and has the power to finally break the dangerous chain of addiction for generations to come."<ref name=ACS>[http://www.cancer.org/docroot/NWS/content/NWS_1_1x_House_Votes_to_Grant_FDA_Control_of_Tobacco_Regulation.asp ACS :: House Votes to Grant FDA Control of Tobacco Regulation]</ref>  The ACS press release also noted that the legislation would "require cigarette companies to disclose all ingredients used in cigarettes and to stop using words like 'light' and 'ultra-light' to give the impression that some tobacco products have a lower health risk."  The legislation also garnered support from the [[American Heart Association]], whose CEO noted that the bill "provides a tremendous opportunity to finally hold tobacco companies accountable and restrict efforts to addict more children and adults." <ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090611/ap_on_go_co/us_fda_tobacco No smoking: Historic vote could bring new limits - Yahoo! News]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref>{{dead link|date=November 2010}} . 

The law was criticized by some as ineffectual, with [[community health]] sciences professor Michael Siegel stating that it "creates the appearance of regulation without allowing actual regulation." Critics argue that without the authority to eliminate nicotine completely, the reduction of nicotine levels in cigarettes may result in compensation by existing smokers, increasing their cigarette smoke inhalation to consume a level of nicotine which will satisfy their cravings. In addition, marketing restrictions enacted by the bill make it more difficult to promote safer smokeless alternatives to cigarettes. The restrictions have been disputed on the grounds of [[free speech]], with some stating that the legislation violates the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. <ref name="Siegel">{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Siegel |title=Tobacco regulations are no regulations at all |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-siegel3-2009jun03,0,1905325.story |archiveurl= |work=Los Angeles Time |date=2009-06-03 |accessdate=2009-06-15}}</ref><ref name="WSJ">{{Cite news|last= |first= |author-link= |publication-date=2009-06-13|year=2009|title =Washington's Marlboro Men|periodical =The Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones & Company|pages=A12|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124484664398811283.html|issn=0099-9660|oclc=4299067|accessdate =2009-06-16|postscript= <!--None-->}}</ref> . 

The bill bans flavored cigarettes, including [[Kretek|cloves]], cinnamon, candy, and fruit flavors, with a special exception for [[menthol cigarette]]s. Because [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] is the largest producer of cigarettes in the United States and the bill would have the effect of  eliminating potential competition, the bill has been nicknamed the ''Marlboro Monopoly Act of 2009''. <ref>{{cite web

===Public health impact===. 
The leading cause of preventable death in United States is Tobacco use, causing a terrible toll in health, lives and dollars on families, businesses and government. Tobacco use kills more than 400,000 people annually — more than [[AIDS]], [[alcohol]], [[car accidents]], [[illegal drugs]], murders and suicides combined. Tobacco costs the U.S. more than $96 billion in [[health care]] expenditures and $97 billion in lost productivity each year. <ref>http://www.tobaccofreekids.org/facts_issues/toll_us/</ref> Despite declines in youth tobacco use over the past few decades, the [[United States]] is still faced with troubling statistics that the FDA regulations help address. <ref>http://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/NewsEvents/ucm217158.htm </ref> . 

===Tobacco in the United States===. 
* High school students who are current (past month) smokers: '''19.5% or 3.4 million [Boys: 19.8% Girls: 19.1%]'''
* High school males who currently use [[smokeless tobacco]]: '''15.0% [Girls: 2.2%]''' 
* Kids (under 18) who try smoking for the first time each day: '''4,000''' 
* Kids (under 18) who become new regular, daily smokers each day: '''1,000+''' 
* Kids exposed to [[second-hand smoke]] at home: '''15.5 million '''
* Workplaces that have smoke-free policies: '''75.1%''' 
* Packs of cigarettes consumed by kids each year: '''800 million (roughly $2.0 billion per year in sales revenue)''' 
* Adults in the USA who smoke: '''20.6% or 46.6 million [Men: 23.5% Women: 17.9%]'''<ref>http://www.tobaccofreekids.org/facts_issues/toll_us/</ref> . 

===Lawsuits and constitutionality===. 
* On August 31 2009, [[Commonwealth Brands]], Inc. v.[[United States]]. Filed a filed suit against the United States and the [[Food and Drug Administration]]. Alleging that the advertising restrictions embodied in the FSPTCA unconstitutionally infringe on the [[First Amendment]]. These provisions include: restricting advertising to black-and-white text; restricting tobacco companies from advertising “light” cigarettes; prohibiting advertising within 1,000 feet of areas where children congregate; banning event sponsorship by tobacco companies; and prohibiting free sample distribution of cigarettes. <ref>http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/elj/60/60.3/Shechtman.pdf </ref> . 

In June 2011, the FDA released nine new warning signs containing both graphic text and images that should be included on all cigarette packaging and advertisement by September 2012. <ref>http://www.csnews.com/top-story-obama_chides_tobacco_cos._for_fighting_warning_labels-59952.html </ref> Four tobacco companies responded to the mandate by filing a legal challenge in August. 
* BBK Tobacco & Foods, LLP vs U.S. Food and Drug Admin., the plaintiffs argued that flavored rolling papers, as utilized in the process of [[roll-your-own]]-tobacco cigarettes, did not qualify as tobacco products under the FSPTCA <ref name="lawlib">http://lawlib.wlu.edu/lexopus/works/944-1.pdf </ref>
* Lorillard Inc. filed lawsuit in the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia]] and was joined by [[R.J. Reynolds Tobacco]] Co., Commonwealth Brands Inc. and Liggett Group LLC, challenging the constitutionality of the FSPTCA, regarding free speech in advertising claims <ref>http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9P5GA900.htm </ref> . 

The constitutionality of the provision requiring graphic warnings on cigarette packs has been questioned with tobacco companies and others saying that the new warnings violated the first amendment by go beyond being informational and require manufactures of a legal product to "engage in anti-smoking advocacy" on the government's behalf. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/08/us-fda-tobacco-idUSTRE7A63V120111108 | work=Reuters | title=U.S. judge blocks graphic cigarette warnings | date=November 8, 2011}}</ref>[[R.J. Reynolds]], [[Lorillard]], [[Liggett Group]] and [[Commonwealth Brands]], filed a lawsuit against the FDA in August 2011. It should be noted that [[Altria]] did not take any legal action. On November 7, 2011, US district judge [[Richard Leon]] granted a temporary injunction postponing the implementation of the new warnings, ruling that "It is abundantly clear from viewing these images that the emotional response they were crafted to induce is calculated to provoke the viewer to quit, or never to start smoking - an objective wholly apart from disseminating purely factual and uncontroversial information."<ref>http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_SMOKING_GRAPHIC_IMAGES?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2011-11-07-12-02-53</ref> It is believed that the issue will ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.  . 

===FDA achievements on FSPTCA===. 
To summarize some of [[Food and Drug Administration]]"s achievements during the brief tenure of the FSPTCA, FDA has:
* Established the [[Center for Tobacco Products]];
* Established the tobacco user fee program, which provides funding for FDA tobacco regulation support activities;
* Begun to enforce the Act’s prohibition on manufacturing, distributing or selling certain flavored cigarettes, such as spice-, fruit-, and candy-flavored cigarettes;
* Implemented new statutory authorities, under which tobacco product manufactures have registered their establishments and listed their products with the FDA, provided detailed information about product ingredients and their own research into the health effects of their products;
* Convened a [[Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee]], which began to study the impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes on the public health;
* Established FDA rules that limit the sale, distribution, and marketing of cigarettes and [[smokeless tobacco]] to protect the health of children and adolescents become legally enforceable;
* Issued provisions that prohibit the advertising or labeling of tobacco products with the descriptors “light,” “mild,” or “low” or similar descriptors without an FDA order; and
* Required that new, larger health warning labels for [[smokeless tobacco]] products. <ref>http://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/NewsEvents/ucm216493.htm</ref> . 

===Tobacco industry advertising & political influence===. 
* Annual tobacco industry spending on marketing its products nationwide: $10.5 billion ($28+ million each day)
* Annual tobacco industry contributions to federal candidates, [[political parties]], and [[PACS]]: Over $2 million
* Tobacco industry expenditures lobbying Congress in 2010: $16.6 million, 162 employees Tobacco companies also spend enormous amounts to influence state and local politics; and, when threatened by the federal
* McCain tobacco control bill in 1998, spent more than $125 million in direct and [[grassroots lobbying]] to defeat it. Since 1998, Altria (Philip Morris) has spent more on lobbying Congress than almost any other business. <ref>http://www.tobaccofreekids.org/research/factsheets/pdf/0072.pdf </ref> . 

Research studies have found that kids are three times as sensitive to tobacco advertising than adults and are more likely to be influenced to smoke by cigarette marketing than by peer pressure; and that a third of underage experimentation with smoking is attributable to tobacco company advertising and promotion. <ref>http://www.tobaccofreekids.org/research/factsheets/pdf/0072.pdf </ref> A Convincing body of evidence demonstrates that tobacco advertising plays an important part in encouraging non-smokers to begin smoking. Comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising and promotion can result in a considerable reduction of tobacco consumption on a national level. <ref>http://www.globalink.org/en/advertising.shtml </ref> .
