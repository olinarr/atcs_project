'''Problem gambling''' (ludomania) is an urge to continuously [[gamble]] despite harmful negative consequences or a desire to stop. Problem gambling often is defined by whether harm is experienced by the gambler or others, rather than by the gambler's behavior. Severe problem gambling may be diagnosed as clinical '''pathological gambling''' if the gambler meets certain criteria. Pathological gambling  is a common disorder that is associated with social costs, and family. The condition is classified as an impulse control disorder, although similarities exist with other disorders, it is  particularly  similar to substance addictions. <ref>http://www.sciencedirect.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/science/article/pii/B9780080453965001792</ref>
Although the term '''gambling addiction''' is common in the recovery movement,<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3_kFAAAACAAJ&dq=gambling+addiction&lr=& Gambling Addiction: The Problem, the Pain, and the Path to Recovery]{{Page number|date=April 2012}}</ref> pathological gambling is considered by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] to be an [[impulse control disorder]] rather than an [[addiction]]. <ref>{{Cite journal | last=Petry | first=Nancy | date=September 2006 | url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118730844/abstract | title=Should the Scope of Addictive Behaviors be Broadened to Include Pathological Gambling? | journal=Addiction | volume=101 | issue=s1 | doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2006.01593.x | pages=152}}{{Page number|date=April 2012}}</ref> . 

==Definition==. 
Research by governments in [[Australia]] led to a universal definition for that country which appears to be the only research based definition not to use diagnostic criteria.  . 

:Problem gambling is characterized by many difficulties in limiting money and/or time spent on gambling which leads to adverse consequences for the gambler, others, or for the community. <ref>Gambling Research Australia (2005) Problem Gambling and Harm: Towards a National Definition http://www.gamblingresearch.org.au/CA256902000FE154/Lookup/GRA_Reports_Files1/$file/NatDefs_ExecSum.pdf</ref> . 

Most other definitions of problem gambling can usually be simplified to any gambling that causes harm to the gambler or someone else in any way. However, these definitions are usually coupled with descriptions of the type of harm or the use of diagnostic criteria. 
According to [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]], Pathological gambling is now defined as separate from a [[manic episode]]. Only when the gambling occurs independent of other impulsive, mood, or thought disorders is it considered its own diagnosis. In order to be diagnosed, an individual must have at least five of the following symptoms: . 

#Preoccupation.  The subject has frequent thoughts about gambling experiences, whether past, future, or fantasy. 
#Tolerance.  As with [[drug tolerance]], the subject requires larger or more frequent wagers to experience the same "rush". 
#Withdrawal.  Restlessness or irritability associated with attempts to cease or reduce gambling. 
#Escape.  The subject gambles to improve mood or escape problems. 
#Chasing.  The subject tries to win back gambling losses with more gambling. 
#Lying.  The subject tries to hide the extent of his or her gambling by lying to family, friends, or therapists. 
#Loss of control.  The person has unsuccessfully attempted to reduce gambling. 
#Illegal acts.  The person has broken the law in order to obtain gambling money or recover gambling losses. This may include acts of [[theft]], [[embezzlement]], [[fraud]], or [[forgery]]. 
#Risked significant relationship.  The person gambles despite risking or losing a [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]], job, or other significant opportunity. 
#Bailout. The person turns to family, friends, or another third party for financial assistance as a result of gambling.  . 

As with many disorders, the DSM-IV definition of pathological gambling is widely accepted and used as a basis for research and clinical practice internationally.  . 

===Biological basis===. 
According to the [[Illinois]] Institute for Addiction Recovery, recent evidence indicates that pathological gambling is an addiction similar to chemical addiction.  It has been seen that some pathological gamblers have lower levels of [[norepinephrine]] than normal gamblers.  . 

According to a logical study conducted by Alec Roy, M.D. formerly at the [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]], norepinephrine is secreted under stress, arousal, or thrill, so pathological gamblers gamble to make up for their under-dosage.  . 

Further to this, according to a report from the [[Harvard Medical School]] Division on Addictions there was an experiment constructed where test subjects were presented with situations where they could win, lose or break even in a [[casino]]-like environment.  Subjects' reactions were measured using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]], a neuro-imaging technique very similar to [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]].  And according to Hans Breiter, MD, co-director of the motivation and [[Emotion Neuroscience Centre]] at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], "Monetary reward in a gambling-like experiment produces brain activation very similar to that observed in a [[cocaine]] addict receiving an infusion of cocaine."<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0896-6273(01)00303-8 | author = Breiter HC, Aharon I, Kahneman D, Dale A, Shizgal P | year = 2001 | title = Functional imaging of neural responses to expectancy and experience of monetary gains and losses | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 30 | issue = 2| pages = 619–639 | pmid = 11395019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.11.009 | author = Hewig J., Kretschmer N., Trippe R., Hecht H., Coles M., Holroyd C., Miltner W. | year = 2010 | title = Hypersensitivity to reward in problem gamblers | url = | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 67 | issue = 8| pages = 781–783 | pmid = 20044073 }}</ref> However, studies have compared gamblers to substance-dependent addicts, concluding that addicted gamblers display more physical symptoms during withdrawal. <ref>Griffiths, M. (2003). Problem gambling. Psychologist, 16(11), 582. Retrieved from http://bf4dv7zn3u.search.serialssolutions.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.atitle=Problem gambling&rft.jtitle=Psychologist&rft.au=Mark Griffiths&rft.date=2003-11-01&rft.issn=0952-8229&rft.volume=16&rft.issue=11&rft.spage=582&rft.externalDBID=PAYT&rft.externalDocID=503677711</ref> . 

Deficiencies in [[serotonin]] might also contribute to compulsive behavior, including a gambling addictions.  . 

===Gambler's Fallacy===. 
{{Main|Gambler's Fallacy}}
It is believed that gambling addiction may, in part, be influenced by the gambler's own erroneous beliefs about the nature of [[probability]]. If one approaches gambling with the intent of winning and they initially end up losing, the only way for them to break even or win in the long run is to keep playing. <ref>http://www.scientificpsychic.com/workbook/gambling.html</ref> . 

Problem gamblers have the erroneous belief that if they keep playing, they will eventually win. While it is logically correct to say that more trials of a probabilistic event increase the likelihood of the event occurring at least once, some hold the fallacious belief that previous failures influence the likelihood of future successes. If individual incidences of probabilistic events are independent of each other, then this belief is incorrect. To hold such a belief is to commit the [[Gambler's Fallacy]].  . 

As an example, there is a 63.3% chance that a slot machine with a 1:100 likelihood of paying out each pull will have paid out once or more after 100 pulls<ref name="bare_url">http://stattrek.com/online-calculator/binomial.aspx</ref>. There is a 39.5% chance that this same machine will have paid out at least once after 50 pulls<ref name="bare_url" />. A problem gambler that is susceptible to the gambler's fallacy would believe that, if after 50 pulls the slot machine has not paid out, there is a 63.3% likelihood that the machine will pay out within the next 50 pulls, because there is a 63.3% chance of the machine paying out within any particular block of 100 trials. In reality, the likelihood that the machine will pay out in the next 50 pulls is 39.5%.  . 

The oversight made here is that independent probabilistic events do not actually influence one another. Gamblers are equating [[Posterior probability|a posteriori]] probability with [[A priori (statistics)|a priori]] probability. Gamblers believe that if there is a certain likelihood of a probabilistic event occurring after a certain number of trials, then as the number of past failures increases, the likelihood of the event occurring in future trials increases. The reality of the situation is that once a particular trial has been deemed a failure, we know a posteriori that there is a 0% chance of that event occurring, even if a priori there is a 1% chance of the event occurring. Within a particular set of 100 pulls, after 50 pulls we are no longer in a block of 100 1:100 events, but a block of 50 0:100 events and 50 1:100 events.  . 

This erroneous belief should be considered at least partly responsible for gambling addiction because the false belief that a payout should be coming soon because one has been playing for so long provides a rational, though poorly informed explanation for why someone may be unwilling to stop playing.  . 

===Relation to other problems===. 
Pathological gambling is similar to many other impulse control disorders such as [[kleptomania]], [[pyromania]], and [[trichotillomania]]. Other mental diseases that also exhibit [[impulse control disorder]] include such mental disorders as [[antisocial personality disorder]], or [[schizophrenia]].  . 

According to evidence from both community- and clinic-based studies, individuals who have pathological gambling are highly likely to exhibit other psychiatric problems at the same time, including [[substance abuse|substance use disorders]], [[mood disorder|mood]] and [[anxiety disorder]]s, or [[personality disorder]]s. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Black DW, Shaw M|title=Psychiatric Comorbidity Associated With Pathological Gambling|journal=Psychiatric Times|volume=25 |issue=12 |year=2008 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/impulse-control-disorders/article/10168/1342537}}</ref> . 

As debts build up people turn to other sources of money such as [[theft]], or the sale of [[drugs]]. A lot of this pressure comes from [[bookies]] or [[loan shark]]s that people rely on for capital to gamble with.  . 

In a 1995 survey of 184 Gamblers Anonymous members in Illinois, Illinois State Professor Henry Lesieur found that 56 percent admitted to some illegal act to obtain money to gamble. Fifty-eight percent admitted they wrote bad checks, while 44 percent said they stole or embezzled money from their employer. <ref>"The Kansas City Star 12/09/97</ref>   . 

Compulsive gambling is often very detrimental to personal relationships. In a 1991 study of relationships of American men, it was found that 10% of compulsive gamblers had been married more than twice. Only 2% of men who did not gamble were married more than twice. <ref>"Legalized Gambling; America's Bad Bet by John Eidsmoe</ref> . 

[[Child abuse|Abuse]] is also common in homes where pathological gambling is present. Growing up in such a situation leads to improper [[emotion]]al [[Child development|development]] and increased risk of falling prey to problem gambling behavior.  . 

==== Suicide rate ====. 
A gambler who does not receive treatment for pathological gambling when in his or her desperation phase may contemplate [[suicide]]. <ref>[http://teenagerstoday.com/resources/articles/highstakes.htm High Stakes: Teens Gambling With Their Futures] by Laura Paul</ref> Problem gambling is often associated with increased [[suicidal ideation]] and attempts compared to the general population. <ref>{{cite journal | author = Moreyra P., Ibanez A., Saiz-Ruiz J., Nissenson K., Blanco C. | year = 2000 | title = Review of the phenomenology, etiology and treatment of pathological gambling | url = | journal = German Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 37–52 }}</ref><ref>Pallanti, S.

Early onset of problem gambling increases the lifetime risk of suicide. <ref>Kaminer, Y., Burleson J. A., Jadamec A. (2002) Gambling behavior in adolescent substance abuse. Substance Abuse, 23, 191-8. </ref> However, gambling-related suicide attempts are usually made by older people with problem gambling. <ref name="Kausch">{{cite journal | doi = 10.4088/JCP.v64n0908 | author = Kausch O | year = 2003 | title = Suicide attempts among veterans seeking treatment for pathological gambling | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 64 | issue = 9| pages = 1031–8 | pmid = 14628978 }}</ref> Both comorbid substance use<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0740-5472(03)00117-X | author = Kausch O | year = 2003 | title = Patterns of substance abuse among treatment-seeking pathological gamblers | url = | journal = Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment | volume = 25 | issue = 4| pages = 263–70 | pmid = 14693255 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/1064-1297.11.3.202 | author = Ladd G.

A 2010 Australian hospital study found that 17% of suicidal patients admitted to the [[The Alfred Hospital|Alfred Hospital]]'s emergency department were problem gamblers. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/gambling-linked-to-one-in-five-suicidal-patients-20100420-srri.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Gambling linked to one in five suicidal patients | first=Kate | last=Hagan | date=April 21, 2010}}</ref> . 

==Prevalence==. 
A study by the [[United Kingdom]] Gambling Commission, the "British Gambling Prevalence Survey 2007", found that approximately 0.6% of the adult population had problem gambling issues, the same percentage as in 1999. The highest prevalence of problem gambling was found among those who participated in [[spread betting]] (14.7%), [[fixed odds betting terminal]]s (11.2%) and [[betting exchange]]s (9.8%). <ref>[http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/pdf/british%20gambling%20prevalence%20survey%202007.pdf The British Gambling Prevalence Survey 2007]</ref> . 

Available research seems to indicate that problem gambling is an internal tendency, and that problem gamblers will tend to risk money on whatever game is available, rather than a particular game being available inducing problem gambling in otherwise "normal" individuals.  However, research also indicates that problem gamblers tend to risk money on fast-paced games.  Thus a problem gambler is much more likely to lose a lot of money on [[roulette]] or [[slot machine]]s, where rounds end quickly and there is a constant [[temptation]] to play again or increase bets, as opposed to a state [[lottery]] where the gambler must wait until the next drawing to see results.  . 

[[Dopamine agonist]]s, in particular [[pramipexole]] (Mirapex), have been implicated in the development of compulsive gambling and other excessive behavior patterns (e.g., PMID 16009751).  . 

==Assessment==. 
The most common instrument used to screen for "probable pathological gambling" behavior is the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) developed by Lesieur and Blume (1987) at the South Oaks Hospital in New York City. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/144/9/1184 |title=The South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS): a new instrument for the identification of pathological gamblers}}</ref> This screen is undoubtedly the most cited instrument in psychological research literature.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} In recent years the use of SOGS has declined due to a number of criticisms including that it over-estimates [[false positives]].  . 

The DSM-IV diagnostic criteria presented as a checklist is an alternative to SOGS, it focuses on the psychological motivations underpinning problem gambling and was developed by the American Psychiatric Association. It consists of ten diagnostic criteria.  One screening measure based upon the DSM-IV criteria is the National Opinion Research Center DSM Screen for Gambling Problems (NODS).  This measure is currently used frequently. The Canadian Problem Gambling Inventory (CPGI) is another newer assessment measure. The Problem Gambling Severity Index<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.problemgambling.ca/EN/ResourcesForProfessionals/pages/problemgamblingseverityindexpgsi.aspx |title=Problem Gambling Severity Index PGSI}}</ref> (PGSI) is composed of nine items from the longer CPGI. The PGSI focuses on the harms and consequences associated with problem gambling.  . 

===Treatment===. 
Most treatment for problem gambling involves counseling, step-based programs, self-help, peer-support, medication, or a combination of these.  However, no one treatment is considered to be most efficacious and no medications have been approved for the treatment of pathological gambling by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  . 

[[Gamblers Anonymous]] (GA) is a commonly used treatment for gambling problems. Modeled after [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], GA uses a [[Twelve-step program|12-step model]] that emphasizes a mutual-support approach.  . 

One form of counseling, [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) has been shown to reduce symptoms and gambling-related urges.  This type of therapy focuses on the identification of gambling-related thought processes, mood and [[cognitive distortions]] that increase one’s vulnerability to out-of-control gambling. Additionally, CBT approaches frequently utilize skill-building techniques geared toward relapse prevention, assertiveness and gambling refusal, problem solving and reinforcement of gambling-inconsistent activities and interests.  . 

As to behavioral treatment, some recent research supports the use of both activity scheduling and desentization in the treatment of gambling problems <ref>Nicki Dowling, Alun C. Jackson & Shane A. Thomas (2008). Behavioral Interventions in the Treatment of Pathological Gambling: A Review of Activity Scheduling and Desensitization. ''International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy, 4(2),'' 172-188. [http://www.baojournal.com]</ref> In general behavior analytic research in this area is growing <ref>Jeffrey N. Weatherly, Kathryn A. Flannery (2007). Facing the challenge: The behavior analysis of gambling. ''The Behavior Anlyst Today, 9(2),'' 130-142 [http://www.baojournal.com BAo]</ref> . 

There is evidence that the [[SSRI]] [[paroxetine]] is efficient in the treatment of pathological gambling. <ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.4088/JCP.v63n0606 | author=Kim SW, Grant JE, Adson DE, Shin YC, Zaninelli R | title=A double-blind placebo-controlled study of the efficacy and safety of paroxetine in the treatment of pathological gambling | journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume=63 | issue=6 | year=2002 | pages=501–507| pmid=12088161 }}</ref>  Additionally, for patients suffering from both pathological gambling and a comorbid bipolar spectrum condition, sustained release lithium has shown efficacy in a preliminary trial. <ref>{{cite journal | author=Hollander E, Pallanti S, Allen A, Sood E, Baldini Rossi N | title=Does sustained release lithium reduce impulsive gambling and affective instability versus placebo in pathological gamblers with bipolar spectrum disorders? | journal=American Journal of Psychiatry | volume=162 | issue=1 | year=2005 | pages=137–145 | pmid=15625212 | doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.162.1.137 }}</ref> The opiate antagonist drug [[nalmefene]] has also been trialled quite successfully for the treatment of compulsive gambling.  . 

===Step-based programs===. 
One step-based program for gambling issues is Gamblers Anonymous. Gamblers Anonymous uses a 12-step program adapted from Alcoholics Anonymous and also places an emphasis on peer support.  . 

Other step-based programs are specific to gambling and generic to healing addiction,  creating financial health, and improving mental wellness. Commercial alternatives, designed for clinical intervention using the best of health science and applied education practices have been used as patient centered tools for intervention since 2007. They include measured efficacy and resulting recovery metrics.  . 

===Peer support===. 
A growing method of treatment is peer support. With the advancement of online gambling, many gamblers experiencing issues use various online peer-support groups to aid their recovery. This protects their anonymity whilst allowing to attempt to self-recover often without having to disclose their issues to loved ones.  . 

=== Self help ===. 
Research into self-help for problem gamblers has shown benefits. <ref>http://modelprograms.samhsa.gov/pdfs/promising/minimal-intervention-approach-to-problem-gambling.pdf</ref> .
