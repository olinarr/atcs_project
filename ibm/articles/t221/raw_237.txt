[[Gambling]] is legally restricted in the United States, but its availability and participation is increasing. In 2007, gambling activities generated gross revenues (the difference between the total amounts wagered minus the funds or "winnings" returned to the players) of $92.27 billion in the United States. <ref name="revenue">{{cite web|url=http://www.americangaming.org/Industry/factsheets/statistics_detail.cfv?id=7|publisher=American Gaming Association|title=Industry Information: Fact Sheets: Statistics: Gaming revenues for 2007|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref> Commercial casinos provided 354,000 jobs,<ref name="employ">{{cite web|url=http://www.americangaming.org/Industry/factsheets/general_info_detail.cfv?id=28|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=American Gaming Association|title=Industry Information: Fact Sheets: General Info: Casino Employment}}</ref> and state and local tax revenues of $5.2 billion {{As of|2006|lc=off}}. <ref name="taxrev">{{cite web|url=http://www.americangaming.org/Industry/factsheets/statistics_detail.cfv?id=10|publisher=American Gaming Association|title=Industry Information: Fact Sheet: Statistics: Tax Payments - Commercial Casinos|accessdate=2007-05-18}}</ref> Critics of gambling claim it leads to increased political corruption, [[compulsive gambling]] and higher [[crime]] rates. Others claim that gambling is a type of [[regressive tax]] on the individuals in local economies where gambling venues are located.  . 

==Gambling revenues==. 
According to the [[American Gaming Association]], legal gambling revenues for 2007 were as follows:<ref name="revenue"/>
* Card Rooms - $1.18 billion
* Commercial Casinos - $34.41 billion
* Charitable Games and Bingo - $2.22 billion
* Indian Casinos - $26.02 billion
* Legal Bookmaking - $168.8 million
* Lotteries - $24.78 billion
* [[Parimutuel wagering|Pari-mutuel Wagering]] - $3.50 billion
Grand Total - $92.27 billion . 

==History==. 
Games of chance first came to the British American colonies with the first settlers. <ref name="CSL">{{cite book | title=Gambling in California | date=March 1997 | chapter=History of Gambling in the United States | publisher=California State Library | url=http://www.library.ca.gov/CRB/97/03/crb97003.html | chapterurl=http://www.library.ca.gov/crb/97/03/Chapt2.html}}</ref> Attitudes on gambling varied greatly from community to community, but there were no large-scale restrictions on the practice. Early on, the British colonies used [[lottery|lotteries]] from time to time to help raise revenue. For example, lotteries were used to establish or improve dozens of universities and hundreds of secondary schools during the 18th and 19th centuries. <ref>{{cite journal | last=Dasgupta | first=Anisha S. | title=PUBLIC FINANCE AND THE FORTUNES OF THE EARLY AMERICAN LOTTERY | journal=Student Scholarship Papers | publisher=Yale Law School | volume=9 | url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/student_papers/9 | date=August 1, 2005}}</ref> A 1769 restriction on lotteries by the British crown became one of many issues which fueled tensions between the Colonies and Britain prior to the [[American Revolution]]. <ref>{{cite book | title=Puritans at play: leisure and recreation in colonial New England | author=Daniels, Bruce Colin | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan | page=182 | year=1995 | isbn=978-0312125004  | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oxExmgyonSAC}}</ref> . 

Lotteries continued to be used at the state and federal level in the early United States. Gambling businesses slowly developed in various communities. The lower [[Mississippi embayment|Mississippi River valley]] became a hotbed of gambling activity with [[New Orleans]] emerging as the nation's leading gaming center. A wave of hostility against gambling in the mid 19th century pushed gambling activity onto boats in the [[Mississippi River]] and toward younger territories in the West. Anti-gambling forces in the northeast put an end to lotteries in those locations and this trend spread to some other parts of the country. The rise of [[railroad]]s caused passenger travel on the Mississippi to decline, heavily damaging the riverboat casinos' revenue. The increasing legal pressures on gambling gradually created opportunities for illegal operations. <ref name="CSL"/> . 

===Gold Rush era===. 
With the advent of the [[California Gold Rush]], [[San Francisco]] became a populous town flush with aspiring prospectors. By the 1850s, the new city had overtaken New Orleans as the gaming capital of the United States. As California gradually strengthened its laws and policing of gambling, the practice similarly went underground. <ref name="CSL"/> . 

===Reconstruction era===. 
Lotteries and other forms of gambling would be revived temporarily in the [[American South|South]] during [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]], and in other areas, but by the early 20th century gambling was almost uniformly outlawed throughout the U.S. Gambling became a largely illegal activity helping to spur the growth of the [[American mafia|mafia]] and other [[organized crime]]. <ref name="CSL"/> . 

Gambling was extremely popular everywhere during the [[American Old West|settlement of the west]] and nearly everyone participated in games of chance. Towns like Deadwood, [[Dodge City]], Denver, and Kansas City were all famous for their many lavish gambling houses. Citizens of the west viewed [[frontier gambler|gamblers]] as respected members of society working at an honest trade.  After the turn of the century, nearly all the western states' governments outlawed gambling and ended it as a way of life.  . 

===Prohibition era===. 
During the [[Prohibition era]], illegal [[liquor]] provided an additional revenue stream for mob figures, and organized crime blossomed. Towns which had already had lax attitudes about vice such as [[Miami, Florida]]; [[Free State of Galveston|Galveston, Texas]]; and [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]] became major gaming centers attracting tourism from around the nation. <ref>{{cite book | title=The last resort: success and failure in campaigns for casinos | author=Dombrink, John; Thompson, William Norman | page=176 | publisher=University of Nevada Press | year=1990 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=F6Z1G1FqcskC}}</ref> The [[Great Depression]] saw the legalization of some forms of gambling such as [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]] in some cities to allow churches and other groups to raise revenue, but most gambling remained illegal. Major gangsters became wealthy from casinos and speakeasies. As legal pressures began to rise in many states, gangsters in [[New York]] and other states looked toward [[Texas]], [[California]], and other more tolerant locales to prosper. <ref name="CSL"/> . 

===1931â€“present===. 
The [[stock market crash of 1929]] and the [[Hoover Dam]] project directly lead to the legalization of gambling in Nevada. In 1931, [[Nevada]] legalized most forms of gambling when Assembly Bill 98 was signed into law, providing a source of revenue for the state. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamblinginfo.com/1_History_of_Gambling.htm|title=Gambling History, from the beginning.|publisher=Gambling Info|accessdate=23 June 2011}}</ref> Interest in development in the state was slow at first as the state itself had a limited population. After [[World War II]], enforcement of gambling laws became more strict in most places and the [[desert]] town of [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] became an attractive target for investment by crime figures such as New York's [[Bugsy Siegel]]. The town rapidly developed during the 1950s dooming some illegal gambling empires such as Galveston. Nevada, and Las Vegas in particular, became the center of gaming in the U.S. In the 1960s [[Howard Hughes]] and other legitimate investors purchased many of the most important hotels and casinos in the city gradually reducing the city's connections to organized crime. <ref name="CSL"/> . 

In 1977, [[New Jersey]] legalized gambling in [[Atlantic City]]. The city rapidly grew into a significant tourist destination, revitalizing what was previously largely a run-down slum community. In 1979, the [[Seminole]] tribe opened the first [[Native American gaming|reservation-based commercial gambling]] beginning a trend that would be followed by other reservations. <ref name="Praeger">Johansen, Bruce. ''The Praeger Handbook on Contemporary Issues in Native America'', Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers, 2007. </ref> Gradually, lotteries and some types of [[parimutuel betting]] were legalized in other areas of the country.  . 

In the 1990s, [[riverboat casino]]s were legalized in [[Louisiana]], [[Illinois]], and other states. <ref>{{cite book | title=Interstate economic relations | author=Zimmerman, Joseph Francis | year=2004 | page=164 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=O1tcAW6C5mAC}}</ref> In 1996, [[Michigan]] legalized gambling in the city of [[Detroit]] creating a economic center for potential casino growth. As the Internet grew in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, [[internet gambling]] exploded in popularity.  . 

==Authorized types==. 
Many levels of government have authorized multiple forms of gambling in an effort to raise money for needed services without raising taxes. These include everything from bingo games in church basements, to multi-million dollar poker tournaments. Sometimes states advertise revenues from certain games to be devoted to particular needs, such as education.  . 

When New Hampshire authorized a state lottery in 1963, it represented a major shift in social policy. No state governments had previously directly run gambling operations to raise money. Other states followed suit, and now the majority of the states run some type of lottery to raise funds for state operations. This has brought about morally questionable issues, such as states' using marketing firms to increase their market share, or to develop new programs when old forms of gambling do not raise as much money.  . 

The [[American Gaming Association]] breaks gambling down into the following categories:<ref name="revenue"/>
* [[Poker|Card Rooms]], both public and private
* [[Casino|Commercial Casinos]]
* [[Charity gambling|Charitable games]] and [[Bingo (US)|Bingo]]
* [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act|Indian casinos]]
* [[Sports betting|Legal bookmaking]]
* [[Lotteries]]
* [[Parimutuel betting|Parimutuel wagering]] . 

==Legal issues==. 
Gambling is legal under US federal law, and each state is free to regulate or prohibit it. If state-run lotteries are included, almost every state can be said to allow some form of gambling. However, casino-style gambling is much less widespread. Federal law provides leeway for Native American Trust Land to be used for games of chance if an agreement is put in place between the State and the Tribal Government (e.g. A 'Compact' or 'Agreement')  under the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]] of 1988.  . 

[[Nevada]] is the only state where casino-style gambling is legal statewide. Both state and local governments impose licensing and zoning restrictions. All other states that allow casino-style gambling restrict it to small geographic areas (e.g., [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] or [[Tunica, Mississippi]]), or to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Indian reservation|reservations]], some of which are located in or near large cities. As sovereign nations, Native American tribes have used legal protection to open casinos, which has been a contentious political issue in [[California]] and other states. In some states, casinos are restricted to "[[Riverboat casino|riverboats]]", large multi-story barges that are, more often than not, permanently moored in a body of water.  . 

[[Online gambling]] has been more strictly regulated. The [[Federal Wire Act]] of 1961 outlawed interstate wagering on sports but did not address other forms of gambling. It has been the subject of court cases. The [[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006]] did not specifically prohibit online gambling; instead, it outlawed financial transactions involving online gambling service providers. Some offshore gambling providers reacted by shutting down their services for US customers.  .

==Commercial casinos==. 
Commercial casinos are founded and run by private companies on non-Indian land. There are 20 states (and two US Territories) that allow commercial casinos in some form: California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana,<ref>[http://data.opi.state.mt.us/bills/mca_toc/23_5.htm Table of Contents, TITLE 23, CHAPTER 5, MCA]</ref> Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, South Dakota, Virgin Islands, Washington, and West Virginia.  . 

The approximately 450 commercial casinos in total produced a gross gaming revenue of $34.11 billion in 2006. <ref name="commlpdf">{{cite web|url=http://www.americangaming.org/assets/files/uploads/2004_Casino_State_Statistics.pdf |format=pdf|title=Casino State Statistics|year=2004|accessdate=2007-05-18|publisher=American Gaming Association}}</ref> . 

==Indian gaming==. 
{{Main|Native American gambling enterprises}}
The history of reservation-based commercial gambling began in 1979, when the Seminoles began running bingo games. <ref name="Praeger"/> Prior to this, the Indians had no previous experience with large-scale commercial gambling. Native Americans were familiar with the concept of small-scale gambling, such as placing bets on sporting contests. For example, the Iroquois, Ojibways, and Menominees would place bets on games of snow snake. <ref name="Praeger"/> Within six years after commercial gambling among Indians developed, seventy-five to eighty of the three hundred federally recognized tribes became involved. By 2006, about three hundred American Indian groups hosted some sort of gaming. <ref name="Praeger"/> . 

Some Native American tribes operate casinos on tribal land to provide employment and revenue for their government and their tribe members. Tribal gaming is regulated on the tribal, state, and federal level. Native tribes are required to use gambling revenue to provide for governmental operations, economic development, and the welfare of their members. Federal regulation of Indian gaming was established under the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]] of 1988. Under the provisions of that law, games are divided into three distinct categories:
* Class I games are "traditional" games that involve little or no wagering. 
* Class II games include bingo, [[pull-tab]]s, and certain non-banked card games ([[poker]], [[cribbage]], [[bridge]], [[whist]], etc.). 
* Class III games include all casino games ([[craps]], [[roulette]], [[blackjack]], [[baccarat]], [[slot machines]] and other games where the player bets against the house) and games that do not properly fall into classes I or II. <ref name="tribal">[http://www.indiangaming.org/library/indian-gaming-facts/ Indian Gaming Facts]</ref> . 

Of the 562 federally recognized tribes at the time, 201 participated in class II or class III gaming by 2001. <ref name="Praeger"/> Tribal gambling had revenues of $14.5 billion in 2002, from 354 casinos. Approximately forty percent of the 562 federally recognized tribes operate gaming establishments. <ref name="tribal"/> . 

Like other Americans, many Native Americans have dissension over the issue of casino gambling. Some tribes are too isolated geographically to make a casino successful, while some do not want non-Indians on their land. Though casino gambling is controversial, it has proven economically successful for most tribes, and the [[impact of Native American gambling]] has proven to be far-reaching.  . 

Gaming creates many jobs, not only for Indians, but also for non-Indians, and in this way can positively affect relations with the non-Indian community. On some reservations, the number of non-Indian workers is larger than the number of Indian workers because of the scale of the casino resorts. <ref name="Political Issues"/> Also, some tribes contribute a share of casino revenues to the state in which they are located, or to charitable and non-profit causes. For example, the [[San Manuel Band of Mission Indians of California]] gave $4 million dollars to the [[UCLA Law School]] to establish a center for Indian Studies. The same tribe also gave $1 million dollars to the state for disaster relief when the area was ravaged by wildfires in 2003. <ref name="Political Issues"/> . 

Although casinos have proven successful for both the tribes and the surrounding regions, state residents may oppose construction of Indian casinos, especially if they have competing projects. For example, in November 2003, the state of [[Maine]] voted against a $650 million casino project proposed by the [[Penobscots]] and [[Passamaquoddy people|Passamaquoddies]]. The project's objective was to create jobs for the tribes' young people.  The same day the state voted against the Indian casino project, Maine voters approved a plan to add slot machines to the state's harness racing tracks. <ref name="Political Issues"/> . 

The [[National Indian Gaming Commission]] oversees Indian gaming for the federal government. The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) was established under the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]] in 1988. Under the NIGC, Class I gaming is under the sole jurisdiction of the tribe. Class II gaming is governed by the tribe, but it is also subject to NIGC regulation. Class III gaming is under the jurisdiction of the states. For instance, in order for a tribe to build and operate a casino, the tribe must work and negotiate with the state in which it is located. These [[Tribal-State compacts]] determine how much revenue the states will obtain from the Indian casinos. <ref name="Political Issues">Welch, Deborah. Contemporary Native American Issues: Political Issues. Chelsea House Publishers, 2006. </ref> . 

The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act requires that gaming revenues be used only for governmental or charitable purposes. <ref name="New Capitalists">Darian-Smith, Eve. ''New Capitalists: Law, Politics, and Identity Surrounding Casino Gaming on Native American Land'', Wadsworth/Thomson Learning, 2004</ref> The tribal governments determine specifically how gaming revenues are spent.  Revenues have been used to build houses, schools, and roads; to fund health care and education; and to support community and economic development initiatives. Indian gaming is the first and essentially the only economic development tool available on Indian reservations. The National Gaming Impact Study Commission has stated that "no...economic development other than gaming has been found". <ref name="New Capitalists"/> Tribal governments, though, use gaming revenues to develop other economic enterprises such as museums, malls, and cultural centers.  . 

==Lotteries==. 
{{Main|Lotteries in the United States}}
The classic lottery is a drawing in which each contestant buys a combination of numbers. Each combination of numbers, or "play", is usually priced at $1. Plays are usually non-exclusive, meaning that two or more ticket holders may buy the same combination. The lottery organization then draws the winning combination of 5-8 numbers, usually from 1 to 50, using a randomized, automatic ball tumbler machine.  . 

To win, contestants match their combinations of numbers with the drawn combination. The combination may be in any order, except in some "mega ball" lotteries, where the "mega" number for the combination must match the ball designated as the "mega ball" in the winning combination. If there are multiple winners, they split the winnings, also known as the "Jackpot". Winnings are currently subject to federal income taxes as [[ordinary income]]. Winnings can be awarded as a yearly [[Annuity (US financial products)|annuity]] or as a [[present value|lump sum]], depending on lottery rules.  . 

Most states have state-sponsored and multi-state lotteries. There are only seven states that do not sell lottery tickets: Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Mississippi, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming. In some states, revenues from lotteries are designated for a specific budgetary purpose, such as education. Other states put lottery revenue into the general fund.  . 

Multi-jurisdictional lotteries generally have larger jackpots due to the greater number of tickets sold. The [[Mega Millions]] and [[Powerball]] games are the biggest of such lotteries in terms of numbers of participating states.  . 

===Scratchcard games===. 
Some [[state lottery|state lotteries]] run games other than the lotteries. Usually, these are in the [[scratchcard]] format, although some states use [[pull-tab]] games. In either format, cards are sold that have opaque areas. In some games, all of the opaque material is removed to see if the contestant has won, and how much. In other scratchcard games, a contestant must pick which parts of a card to scratch, to match amounts or play another form of game.  . 

==States where certain types of legalized gambling have been repealed==. 
On July 1, 2000 a new law took effect in the State of [[South Carolina]] where the ownership, possession and operation of a video poker machine either for commercial or even personal use became illegal. Violators are subject to prosecution and hefty fines. Currently the only type of legalized gambling in the state is the [[South Carolina Education Lottery]]. <ref>[http://casinogambling.about.com/library/weekly/aa101899.htm About.com], accessed February 21, 2007</ref> .
