A '''Voluntary Exclusion Program''' (also known as ''Voluntary Self-Exclusion'') is a policy enacted by several [[United States|U.S.]] states and/or individual [[casino]]s as a method of addressing the issue of addictive and compulsive [[gambling]]. Some Canadian provinces such as [[Manitoba]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlc.mb.ca/MLC/content.php?pageid=420&langdir=E|title=Voluntary Exclusion Program|publisher=Manitoba Lotteries Corporation|accessdate=30 July 2010}}</ref> and [[British Columbia]] also have similar programs.  . 

In areas that have enacted VEP policies, an individual who is aware that they suffer from gambling addiction can voluntarily request that their name be added to the VEP list. If their application is accepted, the person in question becomes legally banned from all participating casinos within the VEP coverage area. If a person who has been added to the VEP list enters or attempts to enter a casino that participates in the VEP, they are immediately [[arrested]] and charged with criminal [[trespassing]]. In addition, any chips, tokens, credits or other winnings in their possession at the time of arrest can be confiscated or invalidated.  . 

The participant must complete the form of their own free will and not be under the influence of alcohol, controlled substances or prescription medication. Once enrolled, it is the responsibility of the VEP participant to stay away from gaming areas of the casinos<ref>http://www.in.gov/igc/2331.htm</ref>. Casinos do not enforce this.  .
