'''Online advertising''' is a form of [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]] that uses the [[Internet]] and [[World Wide Web]] to deliver [[marketing]] messages to attract customers. Examples of online advertising include contextual ads on [[search engine results page]]s, [[banner ad]]s, [[blog]]s, [[Rich Media]] Ads, [[Social network advertising]], [[interstitial ad]]s, [[online classified advertising]], [[advertising network]]s and [[e-mail marketing]], including [[e-mail spam]]. Many of these types of ads are delivered by an [[Ad server]].  . 

==Competitive advantage over traditional advertising==. 
One major benefit of online advertising is the immediate publishing of information and content that is not limited by geography or time. To that end, the emerging area of [[interactive advertising]] presents fresh challenges for advertisers who have hitherto adopted an interruptive strategy.  . 

Another benefit is the efficiency of advertiser's investment. Online advertising allows for the customization of advertisements, including content and posted websites. For example, [[AdWords]], [[Yahoo! Search Marketing]] and Google [[AdSense]] enable ads to be shown on relevant web pages or alongside search result . 

==Online advertisement==. 
The internet has become an ongoing emerging source that tends to expand more and more. The growth of this particular medium attracts the attention of advertisers as a more productive source to bring in consumers.  . 

A clear advantage consumers have with online advertisement is the control they have over the product, choosing whether to check it out or not. <ref name=EBSCOhost>{{cite journal|last=Wakolbinger|first=Lea|coauthors=Michaela, Denk Oberecker, Kluas|title=The Effectiveness of combining Online and Print Advertisement|journal=Advertisind Research|year=2009|month=September|volume=49|issue=3|pages=360â€“372|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}</ref> . 

Online advertisements may also offer various forms of animation. In its most common use, the term "online advertising" comprises all sorts of banner, e-mail, in-game, and keyword advertising, on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, or Myspace has received increased relevance. Web-related advertising has a variety of sites to publicize and reach a niche audience to focus its attention to a specific group. Research has proven that online advertising has given results and is a growing business revenue. <ref>Wakolbinger, Lea.(2009) "The Effectiveness of Combining Online and Print Advertisements"</ref> For the year 2012, Jupiter research predicted $34.5 billion in US online advertising spending.  . 

== Revenue models ==. 
{{main|Compensation methods}} . 

The three most common ways in which online advertising is purchased are [[Cost Per Impression|CPM]], [[Cost Per Click|CPC]], and [[Cost Per Action|CPA]].  . 

* '''CPM (Cost Per Mille)''' or '''CPT (Cost Per Thousand Impressions)''' is when advertisers pay for exposure of their message to a specific audience. "[[Per mille]]" means per thousand impressions, or loads of an advertisement. However, some impressions may not be counted, such as a reload or internal user action.  . 

* '''CPV (Cost Per Visitor)''' is when advertisers pay for the delivery of a Targeted Visitor to the advertisers website.  . 

* '''CPV (Cost Per View)''' is when advertisers pay for each unique user view of an advertisement or website (usually used with pop-ups, pop-unders and interstitial ads).  . 

* '''CPC (Cost Per Click)''' or '''[[Pay per click|PPC]] ([[Pay per click]])''' is when advertisers pay each time a user clicks on their listing and is redirected to their website. They do not actually pay for the listing, but only when the listing is clicked on. This system allows advertising specialists to refine searches and gain information about their market. Under the Pay per click pricing system, advertisers pay for the right to be listed under a series of target rich words that direct relevant traffic to their website, and pay only when someone clicks on their listing which links directly to their website. CPC differs from CPV in that each click is paid for regardless of whether the user makes it to the target site.  . 

* '''CPA (Cost Per Action''' or '''Cost Per Acquisition)''' or '''PPF (Pay Per Performance)'''<ref>[http://www.whyaffiliatemarketing.com/#affiliate whyaffiliatemarketing.com]</ref> advertising is performance based and is common in the [[affiliate marketing]] sector of the business. In this payment scheme, the publisher takes all the risk of running the ad, and the advertiser pays only for the amount of users who complete a transaction, such as a purchase or sign-up. This model ignores any inefficiency in the seller's web site [[conversion funnel]]. The following are common variants of CPA:
** '''CPL (Cost Per Lead)''' advertising is identical to CPA advertising and is based on the user completing a form, registering for a newsletter or some other action that the merchant feels will lead to a sale. 
** '''CPS (Cost Per Sale)''', '''[[Pay Per Sale|PPS]] ([[Pay Per Sale]])''', or '''CPO (Cost Per Order)''' advertising is based on each time a sale is made. <ref>[http://www.brickmarketing.com/define-cost-per-order.htm Brick Marketing]</ref> . 

*'''ECPM: Effective CPM or  ECPM''' calculated through other conversion events such as Cost per Clicks, Cost per Downloads, Cost per Leads etc. for example when an advertiser getting $2 per download and for 100,000 impressions you received 10 downloads worth $20, in this case your effective CPM or ECPM will be 2*20*1000/100,000= $0.4 <ref>[http://www.onlineadvertisingdictionary.com/2012/02/quality-score-googles-adwords-secret.html Online Advertising Dictionary]</ref> . 

*'''Fixed Cost:''' Advertiser paying fixed cost for delivery frame by campaign flight dates without any relevance to performance <ref>[http://www.onlineadvertisingdictionary.com/2011/07/media-buy.html Media Buy Basic Terms]</ref> . 

* '''[[Cost per conversion]]''' Describes the cost of acquiring a customer, typically calculated by dividing the total cost of an ad campaign by the number of conversions. The definition of "Conversion" varies depending on the situation: it is sometimes considered to be a lead, a sale, or a purchase.  . 

=== Privacy ===. 
{{see also|HTTP cookie#Privacy and third-party cookies}}
The use of online advertising has implications on the privacy and anonymity of users.  Hosting the banner images on its servers and using third-party cookies, the advertising company is able to track the browsing of users across these two sites.  . 

Third-party cookies can be blocked by most browsers to increase privacy and reduce tracking by advertising and tracking companies without negatively affecting the user's Web experience. Many advertising operators have an opt-out option to behavioral advertising, with a generic cookie in the browser stopping behavioral advertising.  . 

=== Malware ===. 
There is also a class of advertising methods which are considered unethical and may even be illegal. These include external applications which alter system settings (such as a browser's home page), spawn pop-ups, and insert advertisements into non-affiliated webpages. Such applications are usually labelled as [[spyware]] or [[adware]]. They may mask their questionable activities by performing a simple service, such as displaying the weather or providing a search bar. These programs are designed to dupe the user, acting effectively as [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]]s. These applications are commonly designed so as to be difficult to remove or uninstall. The ever-increasing audience of online users, many of whom are not computer-savvy, frequently lack the knowledge and technical ability to protect themselves from these programs.  . 

== Ethics ==. 
Online advertising encompasses a range of types of advertising, some of which are deployed ethically and some are not. Some websites use large numbers of advertisements, including flashing banners that distract the user, and some have misleading images designed to look like error messages from the [[operating system]], rather than advertisements. Websites that unethically use online advertising for revenue frequently do not monitor what advertisements on their website link to, allowing advertisements to lead to sites with malicious software or adult material. The ethical propriety of advertisers that use web searches for competitors' brands to trigger their own ads has been questioned. <ref>{{Citation| last1 = Rosso| first1 = Mark| last2 = Jansen| first2 = Bernard (Jim)| title = Brand Names as Keywords in Sponsored Search Advertising| url = http://aisel.aisnet.org/cais/vol27/iss1/6| journal = Communications of the Association for Information Systems| volume = 27| issue = 1| pages 81-98| date = August 2010| year = 2010 }}</ref> . 

Website operators that ethically use online advertising typically use a small number of advertisements that are not intended to distract or irritate the user, and do not detract from the design and layout of their websites. <ref>http://modernl.com/article/ethical-blogging-101 Modern Life: Ethical Blogging 101</ref> Many website owners deal directly with companies that want to place ads, meaning that the website linked to by the advertisement is legitimate.  . 

The overuse of technologies like [[Adobe Flash]] in online advertising has led to some users disabling it in their browsers, or using browser plug-ins like [[Adblock]] or [[NoScript]]. Many sites use centralized advertising services whose advertisement may be blocked as a side effect of security and privacy measures, because the services require [[JavaScript]] and cross-site requests to function, while such features are often not necessary to use the sites and are a potential source of [[JavaScript#Security|vulnerabilities]].  . 

Some companies perform [[customer engagement]] studies in online marketing to insure consumer satisfaction, through the use of online compliance centers, building and deploying fraud detection tools, while inspecting websites and publishers to insure website pages offer the highest degree of [[information security]] and compliancy with Can Spam Requirements. <ref>Janis Kestenbaum, [http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2008/05/canspam.shtm "Can Spam Requirements"] Bureau of Consumer Protection, Federal Trade Commission, May 12, 2008</ref> . 

== Types == . 

Though, as seen above, the large majority of online advertising has a cost that is brought about by usage or interaction of an ad, there are a few other methods of advertising online that only require a one time payment. [[The Million Dollar Homepage]] is a very successful example of this. Visitors were able to pay $1 per pixel of advertising space and their advert would remain on the homepage for as long as the website exists with no extra costs.  . 

* Floating ad: An ad which moves across the user's screen or floats above the content. 
* Expanding ad: An ad which changes size and which may alter the contents of the webpage. 
* Polite ad: A method by which a large ad will be downloaded in smaller pieces to minimize the disruption of the content being viewed
* Wallpaper ad: An ad which changes the background of the page being viewed. 
* Trick banner: A banner ad that looks like a dialog box with buttons. It simulates an error message or an alert. 
* Pop-up: A new window which opens in front of the current one, displaying an advertisement, or entire webpage. 
* Pop-under: Similar to a Pop-Up except that the window is loaded or sent behind the current window so that the user does not see it until they close one or more active windows. 
* Video ad: similar to a banner ad, except that instead of a static or animated image, actual moving video clips are displayed. This is the kind of advertising most prominent in [[television]], and many advertisers will use the same clips for both television and online advertising. 
* Map ad: text or graphics linked from, and appearing in or over, a location on an electronic map such as on Google Maps. 
* Mobile ad: an [[SMS]] text or multi-media message sent to a cell phone. 
* Superstitial: An animated adv on a Web page from [[Enliven Marketing Technologies]]. It uses video, 3D content or Flash to provide a TV-like advertisement. Used to be known as Unicast Transitional ads as they were originally made by [[Unicast Communications]] but the company was acquired by [[Viewpoint Corporation]] in 2004, which then changed its name to Enliven in 2008. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=Superstitial&i=52250,00.asp | work=PC Magazine}}</ref>
* Interstitial ad: a full-page ad that appears before a user reaches their original destination.  . 

In addition, ads containing [[streaming video]] or [[streaming audio]] are becoming very popular with advertisers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} . 

===E-mail advertising===. 
Legitimate Email advertising or [[E-mail marketing]] is often known as "opt-in e-mail advertising" to distinguish it from [[e-mail spam|spam]].  . 

=== Display advertising ===. 
Display advertising appears on web pages in many forms, including [[web banners]]. These banners can consist of static or animated images, as well as interactive media that may include audio and video elements. Display advertising on the Internet is widely used for [[brand]]ing. This is why metrics like interaction time are becoming more relevant. This may change in the future as display advertising is becoming much more targeted to users, much like how search engine ads can be extremely relevant to users based on what they are searching for. Display advertisers use cookie and browser history to determine demographics and interests of users and target appropriate ads to those browsers. Banner ad standards have changed over the years to larger sizes, in part due to increased resolution of standard monitors and browsers, in part to provide advertisers with more impact for their investment. The standards continue to evolve. Banner ads can be targeted to internet users in many different ways in order to reach the advertiser's most relevant audience.  [[Behavioral retargeting]], demographic targeting, geographic targeting, and site based targeting are all common ways in which advertisers choose to target their banner ads.  . 

===Affiliate marketing===. 
{{Main|Affiliate marketing}}
[[Affiliate marketing]] is a form of online advertising where advertisers place campaigns with a potentially large number of small (and large) publishers, who are only paid media fees when traffic to the advertiser is garnered, and usually upon a specific measurable campaign result (a form, a sale, a sign-up, etc.). Today, this is usually accomplished through contracting with an [[affiliate network]].  . 

Affiliate marketing was an invention by CDNow.com in 1994 and was excelled by [[Amazon.com]] when it launched its Affiliate Program, called Associate Program in 1996. The online retailer used its program to generate low cost brand exposure and provided at the same time small websites a way to earn some supplemental income.  . 

=== Behavioral targeting ===. 
In addition to contextual targeting, online advertising can be targeted based on a user's online behavior. This practice is known as [[behavioral targeting]]. For example, if a user is known to have recently visited a number of automotive shopping / comparison sites based on clickstream analysis enabled by cookies stored on the user's computer, that user can then be served auto-related ads when they visit other, non-automotive sites.  . 

In the United States the Federal Trade Commission has been involved in the oversight of [[FTC regulation of behavioral advertising|behavioral targeting]] for some time.  In 2011 the FTC proposed a "Do Not Track" mechanism to allow Internet users to [[opt-out]] of behavioral targeting.  . 

=== Semantic advertising ===. 
[[Semantic advertising]] applies semantic analysis techniques to web pages. The process is meant to accurately interpret and classify the meaning and/or main subject of the page and then populate it with [[targeted advertising]] spots. By closely linking content to advertising, it is assumed that the viewer will be more likely to show an interest (i.e., through [[Engagement (marketing)|engagement]]) in the advertised product or service.  .
