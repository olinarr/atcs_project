{{Marketing}} . 

'''Advertising''' is a form of [[communication]] used to encourage or [[persuade]] an audience (viewers, readers or listeners) to continue or take some new action. Most commonly, the desired result is to drive consumer behavior with respect to a commercial offering, although political and ideological advertising is also common. The purpose of advertising may also be to reassure employees or shareholders that a company is viable or successful. Advertising messages are usually paid for by [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]] and viewed via various [[traditional media]]; including [[mass media]] such as [[newspaper]], [[magazines]], [[television commercial]], [[radio advertisement]], [[outdoor advertising]] or [[direct mail]]; or [[new media]] such as [[website]]s and [[text messages]].  . 

Commercial advertisers often seek to generate increased [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of their [[product (business)|product]]s or [[service (economics)|service]]s through "[[brand]]ing," which involves the repetition of an image or product name in an effort to associate certain qualities with the brand in the minds of [[consumer]]s. [[Non-commercial]] advertisers who spend money to advertise items other than a consumer product or service include political parties, interest groups, religious organizations and governmental agencies. [[Nonprofit organizations]] may rely on free modes of [[persuasion]], such as a [[public service announcement]] (PSA).  . 

Modern advertising developed with the rise of [[mass production]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  . 

In 2010, spending on advertising was estimated at $142.5 billion in the United States and $467 billion worldwide <ref name="WPP Group Forecasts">{{cite web|title=http://www.wpp.com/wpp/press/press/default.htm?guid={23ebd8df-51a5-4a1d-b139-576d711e77ac}|last=WPP|url=http://www.wpp.com/wpp/press/press/default.htm?guid={23ebd8df-51a5-4a1d-b139-576d711e77ac}|work=WPP}}</ref>  .

'''The Principle of Advertisement''' . 

Advertisement is an encapsulated communication about a product (good/services), a clearly designed, concise, aesthetically appealing and content-wise accurate communiqué intended to effectively persuade the target audience(viewers/listeners/readers) to arrive at a decision as desired by the advertiser often concerning the product (goods/service). Usually the aim of an advertisement is to increase the sales of a product introduced into the market. The advertisement will speak about the salient features of the product on offer and the benefit the customer/consumer can derive out of the product. It can also educate the target audience about the various other details such as the products cost, availability, usage modalities, problems that may arise whiles using it and the probable solutions to those problems etc.  . 

Advertisement also is used to inform a mass of audience about various socially relevant factors such as employment, upcoming events, contests or elections or a host of other such events. 
Now newer media of advertisements are emerging and growing. Internet based media like social networks, web portals, trade portals etc. are some of those. Marketing managers conceptualise special event simply to coercively communicate product related sales communications. 
Normally the advertisements are prepared in such a way that they attract the attention of the intended parties easily. Thoughtfully constructed copy (words/diction of an advertisement), interesting visual or pictures, attractive colours and designs, a uniquely arrived at theme, the central steam of thought, etc. arouse interest of the customers, and help to retain the interest. Persuasive elements of the advertisement drive the customers towards a strong desire to possess the product. This finally leads them toward buying or possessing the product. Professional managers don’t construe this as the final point in advertising. They proceed for an extra mile to ensure the initial trial becomes a success and ensures repeated clientele.  . 

==History==. 
[[File:Edo period advertising in Japan.jpg|thumb|[[Edo period]] advertising flyer from 1806 for a traditional medicine called ''Kinseitan'']]
Egyptians used [[papyrus]] to make sales messages and wall posters. [[Advertising campaign|Commercial messages]] and political campaign displays have been found in the ruins of [[Pompeii]] and ancient [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]. [[Lost and found]] advertising on papyrus was common in [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]]. Wall or rock painting for commercial advertising is another manifestation of an ancient advertising form, which is present to this day in many parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. The tradition of wall painting can be traced back to Indian [[rock art]] paintings that date back to 4000 BC. <ref name= Bhatia>Bhatia (2000). ''Advertising in Rural India: Language, Marketing Communication, and Consumerism'', 62+68</ref> History tells us that [[Out-of-home advertising]] and [[billboards]] are the oldest forms of advertising.  . 

As the towns and cities of the [[Middle Ages]] began to grow, and the general populace was unable to read, signs that today would say cobbler, miller, tailor or blacksmith would use an image associated with their trade such as a boot, a suit, a hat, a clock, a diamond, a horse shoe, a candle or even a bag of flour. Fruits and vegetables were sold in the city square from the backs of carts and wagons and their proprietors used street callers ([[town crier]]s) to announce their whereabouts for the convenience of the customers.  . 

As education became an apparent need and reading, as well as printing, developed advertising expanded to include handbills. In the 18th century advertisements started to appear in weekly newspapers in England. These early print advertisements were used mainly to promote books and newspapers, which became increasingly affordable with advances in the [[printing press]]; and medicines, which were increasingly sought after as disease ravaged Europe. However, [[false advertising]] and so-called "[[Quackery|quack]]" advertisements became a problem, which ushered in the regulation of advertising content.  . 

As the economy expanded during the 19th century, advertising grew alongside. In the United States, the success of this advertising format eventually led to the growth of mail-order advertising.  . 

In June 1836, French newspaper ''[[La Presse (France)|La Presse]]'' was the first to include paid advertising in its pages, allowing it to lower its price, extend its readership and increase its [[Profit (economics)|profitability]] and the formula was soon copied by all titles. Around 1840, [[Volney B. Palmer]] established the roots of the modern day advertising agency in Philadelphia. In 1842 Palmer bought large amounts of space in various newspapers at a discounted rate then resold the space at higher rates to advertisers. The actual ad - the copy, layout, and artwork - was still prepared by the company wishing to advertise; in effect, Palmer was a space broker. The situation  changed in the late 19th century when the advertising agency of N.W. Ayer & Son was founded. Ayer and Son offered to plan, create, and execute complete advertising campaigns for its customers. By 1900 the advertising agency had become the focal point of creative planning, and advertising was firmly established as a profession.

At the turn of the century, there were few career choices for women in business; however, advertising was one of the few. Since women were responsible for most of the purchasing done in their [[household]], advertisers and agencies recognized the value of women's insight during the [[Creativity|creative process]]. In fact, the first American advertising to use a [[Sex in advertising|sexual sell]] was created by a woman – for a soap product. Although tame by today's standards, the advertisement featured a couple with the message "The skin you love to touch". <ref>[http://www.tvacres.com/adslogans_w.htm Advertising Slogans], [[Woodbury Soap Company]], "The skin you love to touch", [[JWT|J. Walter Thompson Co.]], 1911</ref> .

In the early 1920s, the first radio stations were established by radio equipment manufacturers and retailers who offered programs in order to sell more radios to consumers. As time passed, many non-profit organizations followed suit in setting up their own radio stations, and included: schools, clubs and civic groups. <ref name = "uouynv">[[Robert W. McChesney|McChesney, Robert]], ''Educators and the Battle for Control of U.S. Broadcasting, 1928-35'', Rich Media, Poor Democracy, ISBN 0-252-02448-6 (1999)</ref> When the practice of [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsoring]] programs was popularised, each individual radio program was usually sponsored by a single business in exchange for a brief mention of the business' name at the beginning and end of the sponsored shows. However, radio station owners soon realised they could earn more money by selling sponsorship rights in small time allocations to multiple businesses throughout their radio station's broadcasts, rather than selling the sponsorship rights to single businesses per show.  . 

This practice was carried over to [[commercial television]] in the late 1940s and early 1950s. 
<!-- INSERT TIME PERIOD -->
A fierce battle was fought between those seeking to commercialise the radio and people who argued that the radio spectrum should be considered a part of the commons – to be used only non-commercially and for the public good. The United Kingdom pursued a public funding model for the BBC, originally a private company, the [[British Broadcasting Company]], but incorporated as a public body by [[Royal Charter]] in 1927. In Canada, advocates like [[Graham Spry]] were likewise able to persuade the federal government to adopt a public funding model, creating the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]. However, in the United States, the capitalist model prevailed with the passage of the [[Communications Act of 1934]] which created the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC). <ref name = "uouynv"/> However, the U.S. Congress did require [[commercial broadcasting]] companies to operate in the "public interest, convenience, and necessity". <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/P/htmlP/publicintere/publicintere.htm |title=Public Interest, Convenience and Necessity |publisher=Museum.tv |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref> [[Public broadcasting]] now exists in the United States due to the 1967 [[Public Broadcasting Act of 1967|Public Broadcasting Act]] which led to the [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) and [[National Public Radio]] (NPR).  . 

In the early 1950s, the [[DuMont Television Network]] began the modern practice of selling advertisement time to multiple sponsors. Previously, DuMont had trouble finding sponsors for many of their programs and compensated by selling smaller blocks of advertising time to several businesses. This eventually became the standard for the commercial television industry in the United States. However, it was still a common practice to have single sponsor shows, such as [[The United States Steel Hour]]. In some instances the sponsors exercised great control over the content of the show—up to and including having one's advertising agency actually writing the show. The single sponsor model is much less prevalent now, a notable exception being the [[Hallmark Hall of Fame]].  . 

In the 1960s, campaigns featuring heavy spending in different [[mass media]] channels became more prominent. For example, the [[Esso]] gasoline company spent hundreds of millions of dollars on a brand awareness campaign built around the simple and [[alliteration|alliterative]]<ref name=twsOctS1565>{{cite news

The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the introduction of [[cable television]] and particularly [[MTV]]. Pioneering the concept of the [[music video]], MTV ushered in a new type of advertising: the consumer tunes in ''for'' the advertising message, rather than it being a [[by-product]] or afterthought. As cable and [[satellite television]] became increasingly prevalent, [[specialty channel]]s emerged, including channels entirely [[Shopping channel|devoted to advertising]], such as [[QVC]], [[Home Shopping Network]], and [[ShopTV Canada]].  . 

With the advent of the [[ad server]], marketing through the Internet opened new frontiers for advertisers and contributed to the "[[dot-com bubble|dot-com]]" boom of the 1990s. Entire corporations operated solely on advertising revenue, offering everything from [[coupon]]s to free Internet access. At the turn of the 21st century, a number of websites including the [[Web search engine|search engine]] [[Google]], started a change in [[online advertising]] by emphasizing contextually relevant, unobtrusive ads intended to help, rather than inundate, users. This has led to a plethora of similar efforts and an increasing trend of [[interactive advertising]].  . 

The share of advertising spending relative to [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] has changed little across large changes in [[Mass media|media]]. For example, in the US in 1925, the main advertising media were newspapers, magazines, signs on [[Tram|streetcars]], and outdoor [[poster]]s. Advertising spending as a share of GDP was about 2.9 percent. By 1998, television and radio had become major advertising media. Nonetheless, advertising spending as a share of GDP was slightly lower—about 2.4 percent. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.galbithink.org/ad-spending.htm |title=Annual U.S. Advertising Expenditure Since 1919 |publisher=Galbithink.org |date=2008-09-14 |accessdate=2009-04-20| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090401205848/http://galbithink.org/ad-spending.htm| archivedate= 1 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> . 

A recent advertising innovation is "[[guerrilla marketing]]", which involve unusual approaches such as staged encounters in public places, giveaways of products such as cars that are covered with brand messages, and interactive advertising where the viewer can respond to become part of the advertising message. Guerrilla advertising is becoming increasing more popular with a lot of companies. This type of advertising is unpredictable and innovative, which causes consumers to buy the product or idea. This reflects an increasing trend of interactive and "embedded" ads, such as via [[product placement]], having consumers vote through [[Text messaging|text messages]], and various innovations utilizing [[social network service]]s such as [[Facebook]].  . 

===Public service advertising===. 
The advertising techniques used to promote commercial goods and services can be used to inform, educate and motivate the public about non-commercial issues, such as HIV/AIDS, political ideology, energy conservation and deforestation.  . 

Advertising, in its non-commercial guise, is a powerful educational tool capable of reaching and motivating large audiences. "Advertising justifies its existence when used in the public interest—it is much too powerful a tool to use solely for commercial purposes."  Attributed to [[Howard Gossage]] by [[David Ogilvy (businessman)|David Ogilvy]].  . 

[[Public service advertising]], [[non-commercial advertising]], public interest advertising, [[cause marketing]], and [[social marketing]] are different terms for (or aspects of) the use of sophisticated advertising and marketing communications techniques (generally associated with commercial enterprise) on behalf of non-commercial, public interest issues and initiatives.  . 

In the United States, the granting of television and radio licenses by the FCC is contingent upon the station broadcasting a certain amount of public service advertising. To meet these requirements, many broadcast stations in America air the bulk of their required [[public service announcement]]s during the late night or early morning when the smallest percentage of viewers are watching, leaving more day and prime time commercial slots available for high-paying advertisers.  . 

Public service advertising reached its height during [[World War I|World Wars I]] and [[World War II|II]] under the direction of more than one government. During WWII President Roosevelt commissioned the creation of The War Advertising Council (now known as the [[Ad Council]]) which is the nation's largest developer of PSA campaigns on behalf of government agencies and non-profit organizations, including the longest-running PSA campaign, [[Smokey Bear]].  . 

==Marketing mix==. 
{{Main|Marketing mix}}
The marketing mix has been the key concept to advertising.  The marketing mix was suggested by professor [[E. Jerome McCarthy]] in the 1960s.  The marketing mix consists of four basic elements called the four P’s. 
Product is the first P representing the actual product. Price represents the process of determining the value of a product.  Place represents the variables of getting the product to the consumer like distribution channels, market coverage and movement organization. The last P stands for Promotion which is the process of reaching the target market and convincing them to go out and buy the product.  . 

==Advertising theory==. 
*Hierarchy of effects model<ref>Clow, Kenneth E.; Baack, Donald (2007). Integrated Advertising, Promotion, and Marketing Communications 3rd edition. Pearson Education. pp. 165-171. ISBN 0131866222. </ref>
It clarifies the objectives of an advertising campaign and for each individual advertisement. The model suggests that there are six steps a consumer or a business buyer moves through when making a purchase. The steps are:
#Awareness
#Knowledge
#Liking
#Preference
#Conviction
#Purchase . 

*Means-End Theory
This approach suggests that an advertisement should contain a message or means that leads the consumer to a desired end state.  . 

*Leverage Points
It is designed to move the consumer from understanding a product's benefits to linking those benefits with personal values.  . 

*Verbal and Visual Images .

Virtually any medium can be used for advertising. Commercial advertising media can include [[Mural|wall paintings]], [[billboards]], [[street furniture]] components, printed flyers and [[rack card]]s, radio, cinema and television adverts, [[web banner]]s, mobile telephone screens, shopping carts, web [[Pop-up ad|popups]], [[skywriting]], bus stop benches, [[human billboard]]s, magazines, newspapers, town criers, sides of buses, banners attached to or sides of airplanes ("[[logojet]]s"), [[In-flight advertising|in-flight advertisements]] on [[Tray-table|seatback tray tables]] or overhead storage bins, taxicab doors, roof mounts and [[cabvision|passenger screens]], musical stage shows, subway platforms and trains, elastic bands on disposable diapers,doors of bathroom stalls,stickers on apples in supermarkets, [[Shopping cart|shopping cart handles]] (grabertising), the opening section of [[Streaming media|streaming]] audio and video, posters, and the backs of event tickets and supermarket receipts. Any place an "identified" sponsor pays to deliver their message through a medium is advertising.  . 

;[[Television advertisement|Television advertising]] / [[Music in advertising]]: The TV commercial is generally considered the most effective mass-market advertising format, as is reflected by the high prices TV networks charge for commercial [[Broadcasting|airtime]] during popular TV events. The annual [[Super Bowl]] [[American football|football]] game in the United States is known as the most prominent advertising event on television. The average cost of a single thirty-second TV spot during this game has reached US$3.5 million (as of 2012). The majority of television commercials feature a song or [[jingle]] that listeners soon relate to the product. Virtual advertisements may be inserted into regular television programming through computer graphics.

;[[Infomercial]]s: An [[infomercial]] is a long-format television commercial, typically five minutes or longer. The word "infomercial" combining the words "information" & "commercial". The main objective in an infomercial is to create an [[impulse purchase]], so that the consumer sees the presentation and then immediately buys the product through the advertised [[toll-free telephone number]] or [[website]]. Infomercials describe, display, and often demonstrate products and their features, and commonly have testimonials from consumers and [[advertising professional|industry professionals]].  . 

;[[Radio advertisement|Radio advertising]]: '''Radio advertising''' is a form of advertising  via the medium of [[radio]]. Radio advertisements are broadcast as radio waves to the air from a transmitter to an antenna and a thus to a receiving device. Airtime is purchased from a [[radio station|station]] or [[radio network|network]] in exchange for airing the commercials. While radio has the limitation of being restricted to sound, proponents of radio advertising often cite this as an advantage. Radio is an expanding medium that can be found not only on air, but also online. According to Arbitron, radio has approximately 241.6 million weekly listeners, or more than 93 percent of the U.S. population.  . 

;[[Online advertising]]: Online advertising is a form of [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]] that uses the Internet and [[World Wide Web]] for the expressed purpose of delivering [[marketing]] messages to attract customers. Online ads are delivered by an [[ad server]].  Examples of online advertising include contextual ads that appear on [[search engine results page]]s, [[banner ad]]s, in [[Pay per click|text ads]], [[Rich Media]] Ads, [[Social network advertising]], [[online classified advertising]], [[advertising network]]s and [[e-mail marketing]], including [[e-mail spam]].  . 

;Product placements: '''Covert advertising''', also known as guerrilla advertising, is when a product or brand is embedded in entertainment and media. For example, in a film, the main character can use an item or other of a definite brand, as in the movie ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', where [[Tom Cruise]]'s character John Anderton owns a phone with the ''[[Nokia]]'' logo clearly written in the top corner, or his watch engraved with the ''[[Bulgari]]'' logo. Another example of advertising in film is in ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', where main character played by [[Will Smith]] mentions his ''[[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]]'' shoes several times, calling them "classics," because the film is set far in the future. ''I, Robot'' and ''[[Spaceballs]]'' also showcase futuristic cars with the ''[[Audi]]'' and ''[[Mercedes-Benz]]'' logos clearly displayed on the front of the vehicles. [[Cadillac]] chose to advertise in the movie ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'', which as a result contained many scenes in which Cadillac cars were used. Similarly, product placement for [[Omega SA|Omega Watches]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[VAIO]], [[BMW]] and [[Aston Martin]] cars are featured in recent [[James Bond]] films, most notably ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''. In "[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]", the main transport vehicle shows a large [[Dodge]] logo on the front. ''[[Blade Runner]]'' includes some of the most obvious product placement; the whole film stops to show a [[Coca-Cola]] billboard.  . 

;Press advertising: Press advertising describes advertising in a printed medium such as a [[newspaper]], [[magazine]], or trade journal. This encompasses everything from media with a very broad readership base, such as a major national newspaper or magazine, to more narrowly targeted media such as local newspapers and trade journals on very specialized topics. A form of press advertising is [[classified advertising]], which allows private individuals or companies to purchase a small, narrowly targeted ad for a low fee advertising a product or service.  Another form of press advertising is the Display Ad, which is a larger ad (can include art) that typically run in an article section of a newspaper.  . 

;Billboard advertising: [[Billboard]]s are large structures located in public places which display advertisements to passing pedestrians and motorists. Most often, they are located on main roads with a large amount of passing motor and pedestrian traffic; however, they can be placed in any location with large amounts of viewers, such as on mass transit vehicles and in stations, in shopping malls or office buildings, and in stadiums.  . 

[[File:Redeye Sailboat.jpg|thumb|The ''[[RedEye]]'' newspaper advertised to its target market at [[North Avenue Beach]] with a sailboat billboard on [[Lake Michigan]].]] . 

;Mobile billboard advertising: [[Mobile billboard]]s are generally vehicle mounted [[billboard]]s or digital screens. These can be on dedicated vehicles built solely for carrying advertisements along routes preselected by clients, they can also be specially equipped cargo trucks or, in some cases, large banners strewn from planes. The billboards are often lighted; some being [[Backlight|backlit]], and others employing spotlights. Some billboard displays are static, while others change; for example, continuously or periodically rotating among a set of advertisements. Mobile displays are used for various situations in metropolitan areas throughout the world, including: Target advertising, One-day, and long-term campaigns, Conventions, Sporting events, Store openings and similar promotional events, and Big advertisements from smaller companies.  . 

;In-store advertising: In-store advertising is any advertisement placed in a retail store. It includes placement of a product in visible locations in a store, such as at eye level, at the ends of aisles and near checkout counters (aka POP—Point Of Purchase display), eye-catching displays promoting a specific product, and advertisements in such places as shopping carts and in-store video displays.  . 

;Coffee cup advertising: Coffee cup advertising is any advertisement placed upon a coffee cup that is distributed out of an office, café, or drive-through coffee shop.  This form of advertising was first popularized in Australia, and has begun growing in popularity in the United States, India, and parts of the Middle East.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} . 

;Street advertising: This type of advertising first came to prominence in the UK by Street Advertising Services to create outdoor advertising on street furniture and pavements. Working with products such as [[Reverse Graffiti]], [[air dancer]]'s  and 3D pavement advertising, the media became an affordable and effective tool for getting brand messages out into public spaces.  . 

;[[Celebrity branding]]: This type of advertising focuses upon using celebrity power, fame, money, popularity to gain recognition for their products and promote specific stores or products. Advertisers often advertise their products, for example, when celebrities share their favorite products or wear clothes by specific brands or designers. Celebrities are often involved in advertising campaigns such as television or print adverts to advertise specific or general products. The use of celebrities to endorse a brand can have its downsides, however. One mistake by a celebrity can be detrimental to the public relations of a brand. For example, following his performance of eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China, swimmer Michael Phelps' contract with Kellogg's was terminated, as Kellogg's did not want to associate with him after he was photographed smoking marijuana.  . 

==Sales promotions==. 
Sales promotions are another way to advertise,  Sales promotions are double purposed because they are used to gather information about what type of customers you draw in and where they are, and to jumpstart sales.  Sales promotions include things like contests and games, sweepstakes, product giveaways, samples coupons, loyalty programs, and discounts.  The ultimate goal of sales promotions is to stimulate potential customers to action. <ref>Altstiel, Tom, and Jean Grow. Advertising Strategy: Creative Tactics From the Outside/In. CA: Sage Publication Inc. 2006. Print. </ref> . 

==Media and advertising approaches==. 
Increasingly, other media are overtaking many of the "traditional" media such as television, radio and newspaper because of a shift toward consumer's usage of the Internet for news and music as well as devices like [[digital video recorders]] (DVRs) such as [[TiVo]].  . 

[[Digital signage]] is poised to become a major mass media because of its ability to reach larger audiences for less money.  Digital signage also offer the unique ability to see the [[target audience]] where they are reached by the medium.  Technological advances have also made it possible to control the message on digital signage with much precision, enabling the messages to be relevant to the target audience at any given time and location which in turn, gets more response from the advertising.  Digital signage is being successfully employed in supermarkets. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aimdigitalvisions.com/content/weis-markets |title=Aimdigitalvisions.com |publisher=Aimdigitalvisions.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>  Another successful use of digital signage is in hospitality locations such as restaurants. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aimdigitalvisions.com/content/shady-maple |title=Aimdigitalvisions.com |publisher=Aimdigitalvisions.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> and malls. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aimdigitalvisions.com/content/strawberry-square |title=Aimdigitalvisions.com |publisher=Aimdigitalvisions.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100817010229/http://www.aimdigitalvisions.com/content/strawberry-square| archivedate= 17 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> . 

Advertising on the [[World Wide Web]] is a recent phenomenon. Prices of Web-based advertising space are dependent on the "relevance" of the surrounding web content and the traffic that the website receives.  . 

Reasons for online display advertising: Display ads generate awareness quickly. Unlike search, which requires someone to be aware of a need, display advertising can drive awareness of something new and without previous knowledge. Display works well for direct response. Display is not only used for generating awareness, it’s used for direct response campaigns that link to a landing page with a clear ‘call to action’.  . 

E-mail advertising is another recent phenomenon. Unsolicited bulk E-mail advertising is known as "[[e-mail spam]]".  Spam has been a problem for e-mail users for many years.  . 

A new form of advertising that is growing rapidly is [[social network advertising]]. It is online advertising with a focus on social networking sites. This is a relatively immature market, but it has shown a lot of promise as advertisers are able to take advantage of the demographic information the user has provided to the social networking site. Friendertising is a more precise advertising term in which people are able to direct advertisements toward others directly using [[social network service]].  . 

As the mobile phone became a new mass media in 1998 when the first paid downloadable content appeared on mobile phones in Finland, it was only a matter of time until [[mobile advertising]] followed, also first launched in Finland in 2000. By 2007 the value of mobile advertising had reached $2.2 billion and providers such as [[Admob]] delivered billions of mobile ads.  . 

More advanced mobile ads include banner ads, coupons, [[Multimedia Messaging Service]] picture and video messages, advergames and various [[engagement marketing]] campaigns. A particular feature driving mobile ads is the [[2D barcode|2D Barcode]], which replaces the need to do any typing of web addresses, and uses the camera feature of modern phones to gain immediate access to web content. 83 percent of Japanese mobile phone users already are active users of 2D barcodes.  . 

Some companies have proposed placing messages or corporate [[logo]]s on the side of booster [[rocket]]s and the [[International Space Station]].  . 

Unpaid advertising (also called "publicity advertising"), can provide good exposure at minimal cost. Personal recommendations ("bring a friend", "sell it"), spreading buzz, or achieving the feat of equating a brand with a common noun (in the United States, "[[Xerox]]" = "[[photocopier]]", "[[Kleenex]]" = [[Facial tissue|tissue]], "[[Vaseline]]" = [[petroleum jelly]], "[[The Hoover Company|Hoover]]" = [[vacuum cleaner]], and "[[Band-Aid]]" = [[adhesive bandage]]) — these can be seen as the pinnacle of any advertising campaign. However, some companies oppose the use of their brand name to label an object. Equating a brand with a common noun also risks turning that brand into a [[genericized trademark]] - turning it into a generic term which means that its legal protection as a [[trademark]] is lost.  . 

From time to time, [[The CW Television Network]] airs short programming breaks called "Content Wraps," to advertise one company's product during an entire commercial break. The CW pioneered "content wraps" and some products featured were [[Herbal Essences]], [[Crest (toothpaste)|Crest]], [[Guitar Hero II]], [[CoverGirl]], and recently [[Toyota]].  . 

Recently, there appeared a new promotion concept, "ARvertising", advertising on [[Augmented Reality]] technology.  . 

Controversy exists on the effectiveness of [[subliminal message|subliminal advertising]] (see [[mind control]]), and the pervasiveness of mass messages (see [[propaganda]]).  . 

===Rise in new media===. 
With the dawn of the Internet came many new advertising opportunities. Popup, [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], [[Web banner|banner]], Popunder, [[advergaming]], and email advertisements (the last often being a form of spam) are now commonplace. Particularly since the rise of "entertaining" advertising, some people may like an advertisement enough to wish to watch it later or show a friend. In general, the advertising community has not yet made this easy, although some have used the Internet to widely distribute their ads to anyone willing to see or hear them. In the last three quarters of 2009 mobile and internet advertising grew by 18.1% and 9.2% respectively. Older media advertising saw declines: −10.1% (TV), −11.7% (radio), −14.8% (magazines) and −18.7% (newspapers ).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} . 

===Niche marketing===. 
Another significant trend regarding future of advertising is the growing importance of the [[niche market]] using niche or targeted ads. Also brought about by the Internet and the theory of [[The Long Tail]], advertisers will have an increasing ability to reach specific audiences. In the past, the most efficient way to deliver a message was to blanket the largest [[mass market]] audience possible. However, usage tracking, customer profiles and the growing popularity of niche content brought about by everything from [[blog]]s to social networking sites, provide advertisers with audiences that are smaller but much better defined, leading to ads that are more relevant to viewers and more effective for companies' marketing products. Among others, [[Comcast Spotlight]] is one such advertiser employing this method in their [[video on demand]] menus. These advertisements are targeted to a specific group and can be viewed by anyone wishing to find out more about a particular business or practice at any time, right from their home. This causes the viewer to become proactive and actually choose what advertisements they want to view. <ref>[http://www.comcastspotlight.com/sites/Default.aspx?pageid=7608&siteid=62&subnav=3 "Interactive - VOD"] "Comcast Spotlight website". Retrieved October 5, 2006. </ref> . 

===Crowdsourcing===. 
{{main|Crowdsourcing}}
The concept of [[crowdsourcing]] has given way to the trend of [[user-generated]] advertisements. User-generated ads are created by consumers as opposed to an advertising agency or the company themselves, most often they are a result of brand sponsored advertising competitions. For the 2007 [[Super Bowl]], the Frito-Lays division of [[PepsiCo]] held the ''Crash the Super Bowl'' contest, allowing consumers to create their own [[Doritos]] commercial. <ref name="Advertising Age">{{cite news |url=http://adage.com/SuperBowlBuyers/ |title=Who's Buying What at Super Bowl 2007|publisher=Advertising Age |accessdate=May 10, 2010}}</ref> [[Chevrolet]] held a similar competition for their Tahoe line of SUVs. <ref name="Advertising Age"/> Due to the success of the Doritos user-generated ads in the 2007 Super Bowl, Frito-Lays relaunched the competition for the 2009 and 2010 Super Bowl. The resulting ads were among the most-watched and most-liked Super Bowl ads. In fact, the winning ad that aired in the 2009 Super Bowl was ranked by the [[USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter]] as the top ad for the year while the winning ads that aired in the 2010 Super Bowl were found by Nielsen's BuzzMetrics to be the "most buzzed-about". <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/09/business/media/09adco.html |title=Do-It-Yourself Super Ads |publisher=New York Times |date=February 8, 2010 |accessdate=May 10, 2010|first=Stuart|last=Elliott}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/admeter/2009admeter.htm |title='Two nobodies from nowhere' craft winning Super Bowl ad |publisher=USA Today |date=December 31, 2009 |accessdate=May 10, 2010|first=Bruce |last=Horovitz}}</ref> . 

This trend has given rise to several online platforms that host [[user-generated]] advertising competitions on behalf of a company. Founded in 2007, [[Zooppa]] has launched ad competitions for brands such as [[Google]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Hershey’s]], [[General Mills]], [[Microsoft]], [[NBC Universal]], [[Zinio]], and [[Mini Cooper]]. Crowdsourced advertisements have gained popularity in part to its cost effective nature, high consumer engagement, and ability to generate word-of-mouth. However, it remains controversial, as the long-term impact on the advertising industry is still unclear. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.imediaconnection.com/content/9521.asp |title=Are Consumer-Generated Ads Here to Stay? |publisher=iMediaConnection |date=May 10, 2006 |accessdate=May 10, 2010|first=Robert|last=Moskowitz| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100426103023/http://www.imediaconnection.com/content/9521.asp| archivedate= 26 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> . 

===Global advertising=== . 

Advertising has gone through five major stages of development: domestic, export, international, multi-national, and global. For [[Global marketing|global advertisers]], there are four, potentially competing, business objectives that must be balanced when developing worldwide advertising: building a brand while speaking with one voice, developing [[economies of scale]] in the creative process, maximising local effectiveness of ads, and increasing the company’s speed of implementation. Born from the evolutionary stages of global marketing are the three primary and fundamentally different approaches to the development of global advertising executions: exporting executions, producing local executions, and importing ideas that travel. <ref>Global marketing Management, 2004, pp.13-18</ref> . 

Advertising research is key to determining the success of an ad in any country or region. The ability to identify which elements and/or moments of an ad contribute to its success is how economies of scale<!-- scale? --> are maximised. Once one knows what works in an ad, that idea or ideas can be imported by any other market. [[Market research]] measures, such as [[Wikt:flow of attention|Flow of Attention]], [[Wikt:flow of emotion|Flow of Emotion]] and [[Wikt:branding moment|branding moments]] provide insight into what is working in an ad in any country or region because the measures are based on the visual, not verbal, elements of the ad. <ref>Young, p.131</ref> . 

===Foreign public messaging=== . 

Foreign governments, particularly those that own marketable commercial products or services, often promote their interests and positions through the advertising of those goods because the target audience is not only largely unaware of the forum as vehicle for foreign messaging but also willing to receive the message while in a mental state of absorbing information from advertisements during television commercial breaks, while reading a periodical, or while passing by billboards in public spaces.  A prime example of this messaging technique is [[International Travel Advertising|advertising campaigns to promote international travel]].  While advertising foreign destinations and services may stem from the typical goal of increasing revenue by drawing more tourism, some travel campaigns carry the additional or alternative intended purpose of promoting good sentiments or improving existing ones among the target audience towards a given nation or region.  It is common for advertising promoting foreign countries to be produced and distributed by the tourism ministries of those countries, so these ads often carry political statements and/or depictions of the foreign government's [[Perception management|desired international public perception]].  Additionally, a wide range of foreign airlines and travel-related services which advertise separately from the destinations, themselves, are owned by their respective governments; examples include, though are not limited to, the [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates airline]] ([[Dubai]]), [[Singapore Airlines]] ([[Singapore]]), [[Qatar Airways]] ([[Qatar]]), [[China Airlines]] ([[Taiwan]]/[[Republic of China]]), and [[Air China]] ([[People's Republic of China]]).  By depicting their destinations, airlines, and other services in a favorable and pleasant light, countries market themselves to populations abroad in a manner that could mitigate prior public impressions.

===Diversification===. 
In the realm of [[advertising agencies]], continued industry diversification has seen observers note that “big global clients don't need big global agencies any more”. <ref>{{Cite web|last=Howard |first=Theresa |url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/2005-10-09-goodson-profile_x.htm |title=USA Today, October 9, 2005 |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2005-10-10 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref> This is reflected by the growth of non-traditional agencies in various global markets, such as Canadian business [[TAXI (advertising agency)|TAXI]] and [[SMART (advertising agency)|SMART]] in Australia and has been referred to as "a revolution in the ad world". <ref>{{Cite web

===New technology===. 
The ability to record shows on [[digital video recorder]]s (such as TiVo) allow users to record the programs for later viewing, enabling them to fast forward through commercials. Additionally, as more seasons of pre-recorded [[box set]]s are offered for sale of [[television program]]s; fewer people watch the shows on TV. However, the fact that these sets are '''sold''', means the company will receive additional profits from the sales of these sets.  . 

To counter this effect, a variety of strategies have been employed.  Many advertisers have opted for product placement on TV shows like [[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]. Other strategies include integrating advertising with internet-connected [[EPG]]s, advertising on companion devices (like smartphones and tablets) during the show, and creating [[TV apps]].  Additionally, some like brands have opted for [[social television]] sponsorship.  . 

===Advertising education===. 
[[Advertising education]] has become widely popular with bachelor, master and doctorate degrees becoming available in the emphasis. A surge in advertising interest is typically attributed to the strong relationship advertising plays in cultural and technological changes, such as the advance of online social networking. A unique model for teaching advertising is the [[student-run advertising agency]], where advertising students create campaigns for real companies. <ref>{{Cite web

==Criticisms==. 
{{Main|Criticism of advertising}}
While advertising can be seen as necessary for economic growth, it is not without social costs. [[E-mail spam|Unsolicited commercial e-mail]] and other forms of [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] have become so prevalent as to have become a major nuisance to users of these services, as well as being a financial burden on [[internet service provider]]s. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/03/03/1528247&tid=111 |title=Slashdot &#124; ISP Operator Barry Shein Answers Spam Questions |publisher=Interviews.slashdot.org |date=2003-03-03 |accessdate=20x09-04-20}}</ref> Advertising is increasingly invading public spaces, such as schools, which some critics argue is a form of child exploitation. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/marketing/marketers_target_kids.cfm |title=How Marketers Target Kids |publisher=Media-awareness.ca |date=2009-02-13 |accessdate=2009-04-20| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090416200521/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/marketing/marketers_target_kids.cfm| archivedate= 16 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  In addition, advertising frequently uses psychological pressure (for example, appealing to feelings of inadequacy)  on the intended consumer, which may be harmful.Many even feel that often, advertisements exploit the desires of a consumer, by making a particular product more appealing, by playing with the consumers needs and wants.  . 

==Regulation==. 
{{Main|Advertising regulation}} . 

There have been increasing efforts to protect the public interest by regulating the content and the influence of advertising. Some examples are: the ban on television tobacco advertising imposed in many countries, and the total ban of advertising to children under 12 imposed by the Swedish government in 1991. Though that regulation continues in effect for broadcasts originating within the country, it has been weakened by the [[European Court of Justice]], which had found that Sweden was obliged to accept foreign programming, including those from neighboring countries or via satellite. Greece’s regulations are of a similar nature, “banning advertisements for children's toys between 7 am and 10 pm and a total ban on advertisement for war toys". <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/chidren/advertising_toys_eu.html |title=PPU.org.uk |publisher=PPU.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> . 

In Europe and elsewhere, there is a vigorous debate on whether (or how much) advertising to children should be regulated. This debate was exacerbated by a report released by the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] in February 2004 which suggested [[fast food advertising]] that targets children was an important factor in the epidemic of [[childhood obesity]] in the United States.  . 

In New Zealand, South Africa, Canada, and many European countries, the advertising industry operates a system of self-regulation. Advertisers, advertising agencies and the media agree on a code of advertising standards that they attempt to uphold. The general aim of such codes is to ensure that any advertising is 'legal, decent, honest and truthful'. Some self-regulatory organizations are funded by the industry, but remain independent, with the intent of upholding the standards or codes like the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] in the UK.  . 

In the UK most forms of outdoor advertising such as the display of billboards is regulated by the UK Town and County Planning system. Currently the display of an advertisement without consent from the Planning Authority is a criminal offense liable to a fine of £2,500 per offence. All of the major outdoor billboard companies in the UK have convictions of this nature.  . 

In the US many communities believe that many forms of outdoor advertising blight the public realm. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.urbanblight.org/ |title=Welcome to SCRUB |publisher=Urbanblight.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090422040852/http://www.urbanblight.org/| archivedate= 22 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> As long ago as the 1960s in the US there were attempts to ban billboard advertising in the open countryside. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/beauty.htm |title=How the Highway Beautification Act Became a Law |publisher=Fhwa.dot.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090604005907/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/beauty.htm| archivedate= 4 June 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Cities such as [[São Paulo]] have introduced an outright ban<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/12/12/news/brazil.php |title=Billboard ban in São Paulo angers advertisers - Americas - International Herald Tribune |publisher=International Herald Tribune |date=2009-03-29 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref> with London also having specific legislation to control unlawful displays.  . 

Many advertisers employ a wide-variety of linguistic devices to bypass regulatory laws (e.g. In France, printing English words in bold and French translations in fine print to deal with the Article 120 of the 1994 [[Toubon Law]] limiting the use of English). <ref>Bhatia and Ritchie 2006:542</ref> The advertisement of controversial products such as cigarettes and condoms are subject to government regulation in many countries. For instance, the tobacco industry is required by law in most countries to display warnings cautioning consumers about the health hazards of their products. Linguistic variation is often used by advertisers as a creative device to reduce the impact of such requirements.  . 

==Advertising research==. 
{{Main|Advertising research}}
Advertising research is a specialized form of research that works to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of advertising.  It entails numerous forms of research which employ different methodologies.  Advertising research includes pre-testing (also known as [[copy testing]]) and post-testing of ads and/or campaigns—pre-testing is done before an ad airs to gauge how well it will perform and post-testing is done after an ad airs to determine the in-market impact of the ad or campaign on the consumer.  Continuous [[ad tracking]] and the [[Communicus]] System are competing examples of post-testing advertising research types.  . 

==Semiotics==. 
{{Main|Advertising research}}
Today’s culture is made up of meanings between consumers and marketers.  These meanings depict [[signs]] and symbols that are encoded in everyday objects. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Mick|first=Devid Glen|title=Consumer Research and Semiotics: Exploring the Morphology of Signs, Symbols, and Significance|journal=The Journal of Consumer Research|year=1986|month=September|volume=13|issue=2|pages=196|doi=10.1086/209060}}</ref>[[Semiotics]] is the study of signs and how they are interpreted.  Advertising has many hidden signs and meanings within [[brand names]], [[logos]], package designs, print [[advertisements]], and [[television advertisements]].  The purpose of [[semiotics]] is to study and interpret the message being conveyed in [[advertisements]]. [[Logos]] and [[advertisements]] can be interpreted at two levels known as the surface level and the underlying level.  The surface level uses signs creatively to create an image or personality for their product.  These [[signs]] can be images, words, fonts, [[colors]], or slogan.  The underlying level is made up of hidden meanings.  The combination of images, words, [[colors]], and slogan must be interpreted by the audience or consumer. <ref>{{cite book|last=Beasley|first=Ron|title=Persuasive Signs: The Semiotics of Advertising|year=2002|publisher=Walter deGruyter GmbH & KG|location=Berlin, Germany|isbn=3-11-017341-7}}</ref> The “key to advertising analysis” is the signifier and the signified.  The signifier is the object and the signified is the mental concept. <ref>{{cite book|last=Pinson|first=Christian|title=Marketing Semiotics|year=1998|url=http://flora.insead.edu/fichiersti_wp/inseadwp1998/98-39.pdf}}</ref>   A product has a signifier and a signified.  The signifier is the [[color]], brand name, logo design, and technology.  The signified has two meanings known as denotative and connotative.  The denotative meaning is the meaning of the product.  A television’s denotative meaning would be that it is high definition.  The connotative meaning is the product’s deep and hidden meaning.  A connotative meaning of a television would be that it is top of the line. <ref>{{cite book|last=Umiker-Sebeok|first=Donna Jean|title=Marketing and Semiotics|year=1987|publisher=Walter de Gruyter & Co.|location=Berlin}}</ref>  . 

Apple is an excellent example of using [[semiotics]] in their advertising campaign.   Apple’s commercials used a black silhouette of a person that was the age of Apple's target market.  They placed the silhouette in front of a blue screen so that the picture behind the silhouette could be constantly changing.  However, the one thing that stays the same in these ads is that there is music in the background and the silhouette is listening to that music on a white iPod through white headphones.  Through advertising, the white color on a set of earphones now signifies that the music device is an iPod.  The white color signifies almost all of Apple’s products. <ref>{{cite web|last=Salsburey|first=Justin|title=Semiotic analysis of iPod Advertisements|url=http://sites.google.com/site/jsalsburey/macintoshsemiotics}}</ref>   . 

The [[semiotics]] of [[gender]] plays a key influence on the way in which signs are interpreted. When considering [[Gender advertisement|gender roles in advertising]], individuals are influenced by three categories.  Certain characteristics of stumuli may enhance or decrease the elaboration of the [[message]] (if the product is perceived as [[feminine]] or [[masculine]]).  Second, the characteristics of individuals can affect [[attention]] and elaboration of the [[message]] ([[traditional]] or non-traditional [[gender role]] orientation).  Lastly, situational factors may be important to influence the elaboration of the [[message]]. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Ademola|first=Owolabi|title=Effects of Gender-Role Orientation, Sex of Advert Presenter and Product Type on Advertising Effectiveness|journal=European Journal of Scientific Research|year=2005|volume=35|issue=4|pages=537–543}}</ref> . 

There are two types of [[marketing communication]] claims-objective and subjective. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Koc|first=Erdogan|title=Impact of gender in marketing communications: the role of cognitive and affective cues|journal=Journal of Marketing Communications|year=2002|volume=8|issue=4|pages=257|doi=10.1080/13527260210145993}}</ref>  Objective claims stem from the extent to which the claim associates the brand with a tangible product or [[Service (economics)|service]] feature.  For instance, the [[camera]] has auto focus features. Subjective claims convey emotional, subjective, impressions of intangible aspects of a product or service.  They are non-physical features of a product or service that cannot be directly perceived, as they have no physical [[reality]].  For instance the [[brochure]] has a beautiful [[design]]. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Holbrook|first=Morris|title=Beyond Attitude Structure: Toward the Informational Determinants of Attitude|journal=Journal of Marketing Research|year=1978|month=November|volume=15|issue=4}}</ref>  [[Males]] tend to respond better to objective marketing communications claims while [[females]] tend to respond better to subjective [[marketing communications]] claims. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Silverman|first=Julian|coauthors=King, Catherine|title=Pseudoperceptual defferentiation|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|year=1970|volume=34|issue=1|pages=119–23|doi=10.1037/h0028807|pmid=5436459}}</ref> . 

When advertising to different [[genders]] it is important to remember how men and women process [[information]].  [[Females]] process [[information]] comprehensively.  [[Males]] process [[information]] through heuristic devices such as [[procedures]], methods or [[strategies]] for solving [[problems]]. <ref>{{cite book|last=Statt|first=David|title=Understanding the Consumer - A Psychological Approach|year=1977|publisher=Macmillan Press|location=London}}</ref>  Men prefer to have available and apparent cues to interpret the message where females engage in more creative, associative, imagery-laced interpretation.  . 

In advertisements, men are represented as independent.  They are shown in more occupations than women.  Women are represented mainly as housewives and mothers.  Men are more likely to be shown advertising cars or business products, while women advertise domestic products.  Men are more likely to be shown outdoors or in business settings.  Women are depicted in domestic settings. Men are more often portrayed as authorities.  As far as ads go, with age men seem to gain wisdom and authority.  On the other hand women seem to disappear with age.  Voiceovers are commonly used in advertising.  Most [[voiceovers]] are men (figures of up to 94% have been reported).  There have been more [[female]] voiceovers in recent years but mainly for food, household products, and feminine care products. <ref>{{cite web|last=Chandler|first=Daniel|title=Television and Gender Roles|url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Modules/TF33120/gendertv.html}}</ref> .
