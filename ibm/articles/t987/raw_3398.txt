The '''effects of advertising on body image''' have been studied by researchers, ranging from psychologists to professors of Marketing. <ref name=Martin/><ref name="Posavac"/><ref name="Bristol"/> This is due to the fact that thousands of [[advertisements]] contain messages about [[physical attractiveness]] and [[beauty]], examples of which include commercials for clothes, cosmetics, weight reduction, and physical fitness. <ref name="Downs"/> Researchers have conducted studies in an attempt to see if such advertisements have effects on teenage [[[[body image]]]], and what those effects might be. <ref name="Martin">Martin, Mary C. and Gentry, James W. “Stuck in the Model Trap: The Effects of Beautiful Models on Female Pre-Adolescents and Adolescents.” The Journal of Advertising (1997): 19-34</ref> . 

Researchers, such as Mary Martin and James Gentry, have found that teen advertising negatively impacts teenagers’ [[self-esteem]] by setting unrealistic expectations for them about their physical appearances through the use of idealized models. <ref name="Martin"/> Other researchers, such as Heidi Posavac, acknowledge this, but believe that this only applies to teenagers who already possess low self-esteem or a poor self-images. <ref name="Posavac"/> . 

In contrast, researchers, including Terry Bristol, have found teenagers to be generally unaffected by these advertisements due to the idea that repeat exposure can create an immunity to images and messages in advertisements. <ref name="Bristol"/> Moreover, some researchers, such as Paul Humphreys, have concluded that exposure to such advertisements can actually create higher self-esteem in teenagers. <ref name="Humphreys"/><ref name="Meyers"/> . 

== Background ==. 
According to Medimark Research Inc., a [[marketing research]] company, teenagers are important to [[marketers]] because they "have significant discretionary income; spend family money, as well as influence their parents' spending on both large and small household purchases; establish and affect [[fashion]], lifestyle, and overall [[trends]]; and provide a 'window' into our society – a view of how it is now and what it is likely to become."<ref name="Mediamark">http://www.magazine.org/content/files/teenprofile04.pdf</ref>  . 

Almost half of the space of the most popular magazines for adolescent girls is made up of advertisements. <ref name="Martin"/> In an effort to further reach young men with advertisements, branded content is now being included in video games as well. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/26214/ |title=MediaPost Publications Targeting Young Males |publisher=Mediapost.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28}}</ref>Researches are trying to determine whether or not these advertisements shape the body image and self-esteem of the impressionable teenagers that view them.  . 

== Negative effects ==. 
=== Effects on young women ===. 
A study by A. Chris Downs and Sheila Harrison from ''[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Roles_(journal)|Sex Roles: A Journal of Research]]'' found that one out of every 3.8 television [[commercials]] has a message about attractiveness in it. They determined that viewers receive roughly 5,260 advertisements related to attractiveness per year (or at least 14 per day). Of these messages, 1,850 of them are specifically about beauty. <ref name="Downs">{{cite web|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/w4rq5u2044175080/ |title=Embarrassing age spots or just plain ugly? Physical attractiveness stereotyping as an instrument of sexism on american television commercials |publisher=Springerlink.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28}}</ref> . 

In a study published in the ''[[Journal of Advertising]]'', Marketing professors Mary Martin and James Gentry noted that images of [[blonde]], thin women are predominant in mass media, and that these characteristics are often portrayed as being ideal. <ref name="Martin"/> Martin and Gentry also found that advertising can "impose a sense of inadequacy on young women's self-concepts." This is because some girls and young women compare their own physical attractiveness to the physical attractiveness of models in ads. They then experience lowered [[self-esteem]] if they do not feel that they look like the models in advertisements. <ref name="Martin"/>  . 

Today's models weigh 23 percent less than the average woman and that the average model two decades ago weighed eight percent less than the average woman. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/issues/stereotyping/women_and_girls/women_beauty.cfm |title=Beauty and Body Image in the Media |publisher=Media-awareness.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28}}</ref> This current media ideal of thinness is met by only about five percent of the population. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sirc.org/publik/mirror.html |title=Mirror, mirror - A summary of research findings on body image |publisher=Sirc.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28}}</ref>  . 

Additionally, a study of ''[[Seventeen magazine]]'' concluded that the models featured in this popular teen magazine were far less curvy than those portrayed in women's magazines. It was also noted that the hip-to-waist ratio had decreased in these models from 1970 to 1990. <ref name="Martin"/>  . 

In a study published in ''Sex Roles: A Journal of Research'', psychologists Heidi Posavac, Steven Posavac, and Emil Posavac found that many young women will express dissatisfaction with their bodies, particularly with their [[body weight]], when they are exposed to images of thin models who are slimmer than the average woman<ref name="Posavac">Posavac, Heidi D., Posavac, Steven S., and Posavac, Emil J. ''Exposure to Media Images of Female Attractiveness and Concern with Body Weight Among Young Women'' Sex Roles, Volume 38, 187-201. </ref> . 

Expressing similar sentiments, an aspiring young model was quoted as saying, "Deep down I still want to be a [[supermodel]]... As long as they're there, screaming at me from the television, glaring at me from the magazines, I'm stuck in the model trap. Hate them first. Then grow to like them. Love them. Emulate them. Die to be them. All the while praying the cycle will come to an end."<ref name="Martin"/>  . 

Academic researchers Philip Myers Jr. and Frank Biocca concluded, in their study published in the ''[[Journal of Communication]]'', that a woman's self-perceived body image can change after watching a half-an-hour of television programming and advertising. <ref name="Meyers">Myers, Philip N. Jr. and Biocca, Frank A. ''The Elastic Body Image: The Effects of Television Advertising and Programming on Body Image Distortions on Young Women'', Journal of Communications (1992): 1-26</ref> Researchers Yoku Yamamiya and Thomas F. Cash concluded through their study that "Even a 5 minute exposure to thin-and-beautiful media images results in a more negative body image state than does exposure to images of neutral object." <ref>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1740144504000737
</ref> . 

Likewise, a study by Stice et al in the ''[[Journal of Abnormal Psychology]]'' concluded that there is a direct relationship between the amount of media exposure that a young woman has and the likelihood that she will develop [[eating disorder]] symptoms<ref>http://athena.uwindsor.ca/users/j/jarry/main.nsf/032ecd0df8f83bdf8525699900571a93/aa9ed943e56182bf85256abe005bc3f6/$FILE/Stice%20et%20al%20%281994%29.pdf</ref>  . 

Martin and Gentry also found that the mass media "creates and reinforces a preoccupation with physical attractiveness in young women," which can lead to [[bulimia]], [[anorexia]], and opting for [[cosmetic surgery]]. She also concluded that, "exposure to ultra-thin models in advertisements and magazine pictures produced [[Depression (mood)|depression]], stress, [[guilt]], [[shame]], insecurity, and body dissatisfaction in female college students."<ref name="Martin"/>  . 

In a study published in the ''Journal of Youth and Adolescence'', Paxton et al found body dissatisfaction to be more prevalent in young women than in young men. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/r663485018566483/ |title=Journal of Youth and Adolescence, Volume 20, Number 3 |publisher=SpringerLink |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28}}</ref> . 

Low self-esteem that stems from teenage advertising can have detrimental effects on teenagers. Seventy-five percent of young women with low self-esteem report engaging in negative activities such as "cutting, [[bullying]], [[smoking]], or drinking when feeling badly about themselves."  . 

Teen [[promiscuity]] is another possible effect of low self-esteem. <ref name="do">{{cite web|url=http://www.dosomething.org/tipsandtools/11-facts-about-teens-and-self-esteem |title=11 Facts about Teens and Self-Esteem |publisher=Do Something |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28}}</ref> . 

=== Effects on young men ===. 
Research by Lynch et al in the ''Journal of Youth and Adolescence'' found that the media sets unrealistic expectations for teen boys and that this can cause negative psychological impacts, including "eating disorders, body image problems, and the construction of negative gender stereotypes."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m7225317781257j7/ |title=Journal of Youth and Adolescence, Volume 30, Number 2 |publisher=SpringerLink |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28}}</ref>  . 

"Teenage boys can be prone to obsessive [[exercising]], [[binge eating]], anorexia nervosa, bulimia, [[steroid abuse]] and diet aid abuse."<ref name="do"/> . 

The [[Media Awareness Network]] notes that young men in advertisements are often portrayed as having a cool, confident, independent, or rebellious attitude. They are frequently shown as physically strong, powerful, athletic, dominant, and emotionally detached while lacking sensitivity, vulnerability, and compassion. Also, they are generally very physically attractive with clear skin. "Many ads show men engaging in physically challenging, dangerous, or aggressive sports or acts which exhibit their physical or sexual prowess." Young men can see these portrayals in ads and feel pressure to act like this as well. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/resources/educational/handouts/body_image/tpoh_advertising_and_image.cfm |title=Advertising and Image &#124; Handout |publisher=Media-awareness.ca |date=2010-07-08 |accessdate=2011-11-28}}</ref>  . 

One observer stated, "Advertisements in men’s magazines promote the possession of stuff as a valuable, important attribute to have, while lowering the self-esteem of men who do not own the trendiest fashions or have perfect six-pack abs."<ref>http://www.csl.mtu.edu/~tgwaltz/worksamples/Documents/SeniorCompResearchPaper.pdf</ref>  . 

Moreover, men in advertisements are more [[muscular]] today than they were 25 to 30 years ago. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/973-men-muscle-body-image-problems.html |title=Men Muscle in on Body Image Problems |publisher=LiveScience |date=2006-08-15 |accessdate=2011-11-28}}</ref>  . 

A 2002 study found that male college students who are exposed to advertisements featuring muscular men show a significant "discrepancy between their own perceived muscularity and the level of muscularity that they ideally wanted to have."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eat.10019/abstract |title=The media's representation of the ideal male body: A cause for muscle dysmorphia? - Leit - 2002 - International Journal of Eating Disorders - Wiley Online Library |publisher=Onlinelibrary.wiley.com |date=2001-02-14 |accessdate=2011-11-28}}</ref>  . 

Additionally, a study from the ''Journal of Social and Clinical Pyshology'' by Daniel Agliata and Stacey Tantleff-Dunn found that exposure to media images of lean and muscular men increases muscle dissatisfaction, depression, [[anger]], and [[anxiety]] in young men. <ref>http://arapaho.nsuok.edu/~scottd/image-1.pdf</ref>  . 

Physician and professor of Psychology Harrison Pope theorized, “Many boys are [[embarrassed]] and ashamed of their appearance concerns, and keep them a secret. They may feel it ‘wimpy’ or ‘girlish’ to worry about their looks... [they're] increasingly vulnerable to the advertising messages of the supplement industry and other body image industries eager to capitalize on their anxieties.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/par34.htm |title=Whose Body Is This? Society's Ideal Male Body |publisher=Bodybuilding.com |date=2003-12-15 |accessdate=2011-11-28}}</ref> . 

==Positive or neutral effects==. 
===Effects on teenagers===. 
Heidi Posavac, Steven Posavac, and Emil Posavac found that young women who are already content with their bodies are generally unaffected by media images of models and other attractive women. They concluded that only those who are dissatisfied with their bodies prior to viewing advertisements will then feel poorly after seeing advertisements featuring thin, attractive women. <ref name="Posavac"/>  . 

Furthermore, Myers and Biocca found that some young women actually feel thinner after viewing advertisements featuring thin, idealized women. <ref name="Meyers"/>  . 

Likewise, a study by professors of Psychology Paul Humphreys and Susan Paxton suggests that young men who view images of idealized men either feel no different or feel more positive about themselves after viewing such images. <ref name="Humphreys">{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1740144504000518#sec2 |title=Body Image : Impact of exposure to idealised male images on adolescent boys’ body image |publisher=ScienceDirect |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28}}</ref> . 

Tamara Mangleburg and Terry Bristol's studies featured in the ''The Journal of Advertising'' found that teens are not typically swayed by images in advertisements. They suggest the more teens view advertisements, the less they are affected by them and the more they become skeptical of the messages that are in advertisements. This is because repeat exposure to ads can give them a better understanding of the motives behind such ads. <ref name="Bristol">Mangleburg, Tamara F. and Bristol, Terry. "Socialization and Adolescents’ Skepticism Toward Advertising", ''The Journal of Advertising'' (1998): 11-21</ref>  . 

Similarly, Marsha Richins, former president of the Association for Consumer Research, theorized that, "by late adolescence... the sight of extremely attractive models is 'old news' and unlikely to provide new information that might influence self-perception". <ref name="Martin"/> "[Yamamiya and Cash] used 20 model slides as stimuli, presented for a total duration of 5 minutes found that as the number of stimuli exceeded 10, viewers were somewhat less influenced, probably due to habituation." <ref>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1740144504000737</ref> . 

Psychological researchers Christopher Ferguson, Benjamin Winegard, and Bo Winegard feel that the media’s effects on body dissatisfaction have been over-exaggerated. They believe that media does not heavily influence body dissatisfaction. Instead, they have found peers to have a much greater influence than the media in terms of body dissatisfaction in teenagers. <ref>http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Who%20Is%20the%20Fairest.pdf</ref> .
