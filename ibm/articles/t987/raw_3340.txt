==History==. 
Adbusters was founded in 1989 by [[Kalle Lasn]] and [[Bill Schmalz]], a duo of award-winning documentary filmmakers living in Vancouver. Since the early 1980s, Lasn had been making films that explored the spiritual and cultural lessons the West could learn from the Japanese experience with capitalism.  . 

In 1988, the [[British Columbia Council of Forest Industries]], the "voice" of the logging industry, was facing tremendous public pressure from a growing environmentalist movement. The logging industry fought back with a [[television ad]] campaign called "[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAzlAu3sK3A Forests Forever]." It was an early example of [[greenwashing]]: shots of happy children, workers and animals with a kindly, trustworthy sounding narrator who assured the public that the logging industry was protecting the forest.  . 

[[File:adbusters talkingrainforest.jpg|thumb|Adbusters' first uncommercial]]
Lasn and Shmalz were outraged by the use of the public airwaves to deliver what they felt was deceptive anti-environmentalist propaganda. And they responded by producing the "[http://www.adbusters.org/abtv/talking_rainforest.html Talking Rainforest]" anti-ad in which an old-growth tree explains to a sapling that "a tree farm is not a forest." But the duo wasn't able to buy airtime on the same stations that had aired the forest-industry ad. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} According to a former Adbusters employee, "The CBC's reaction to the proposed [[television commercial]] created the real flash point for the Media Foundation. It seemed that Lasn and Schmaltz's commercial was too controversial to air on the CBC. An environmental message that challenged the large forestry companies was considered 'advocacy advertising' and was disallowed, even though the 'informational' messages that glorified clearcutting were OK."<ref>[http://www.evolutionzone.com/kulturezone/futurec/culture.jammers.manifesto "Adbusters Zine from 1993"]. </ref> . 

The foundation was born out of their realization that citizens do not have the same access to the information flows as corporations. One of the foundation's  key campaigns continues to be the [http://www.adbusters.org/campaigns/mediacarta Media Carta], a "movement to enshrine The Right to Communicate in the constitutions of all free nations, and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights." . 

For the foundation, concern over the flow of information goes beyond the desire to protect democratic transparency, freedom of speech or the public’s access to the airwaves. Although it supports these causes, the foundation instead situates the battle of the mind at the center of its political agenda. Fighting to counter pro-consumerist advertising is done not as a means to an end, but as the end in itself. This shift in emphasis is a crucial element of mental environmentalism.  . 

==Mental environmentalism==. 
The subtitle of ''Adbusters'' magazine is "The Journal of the Mental Environment." . 

In a 1996 interview, [[Kalle Lasn]] explained the foundation's goal: <blockquote>"What we're trying to do is pioneer a new form of social activism using all the power of the mass media to sell ideas, rather than products. We're motivated by a kind of `greenthink' that comes from the environmental movement and isn't mired in the old ideology of the left and right. Instead, we take the environmental ethic into the mental ethic, trying to clean up the toxic areas of our minds.  . 

You can't recycle and be a good environmental citizen, then watch four hours of television and get consumption messages pumped at you."<ref>{{cite journal |first=Jim |last=Motavalli |date=April 30, 1996 |title=Cultural Jammin' |url=http://www.emagazine.com/magazine-archive/cultural-jammin |journal=[[E - The Environmental Magazine]] |volume=7 |issue=3 |page=41}}</ref></blockquote> . 

==Issues==. 
===Anti-advertising===. 
Adbusters is anti-advertising: it blames advertising for playing a central role in creating, and maintaining, consumer culture. This argument is based on the fact that the advertising industry goes to great effort and expense to associate desire and identity with commodities.  Adbusters believes that advertising has unjustly "colonized" public, discursive and psychic spaces, by appearing in movies, sports and even schools, so as to permeate modern cultures. <ref name="ReferenceA" />  Adbusters' goals include combating the negative effects of advertising and empowering its readers to regain control of culture, encouraging them to ask "Are we consumers and citizens?."<ref>[Marnie W. Curry-Tash, “The Politics of Teleliteracy and Adbusting in the Classroom”, ''English Journal'' 87(1), 1998]</ref> . 

To counter the belief that advertising focuses on looking toward external rewards for a sense of self, Adbusters recognizes a “natural and authentic self apart from the consumer society”. <ref>[ Joseph D. Rumbo, “Consumer Resistance in a World of Advertising Clutter: The Case of Adbusters”, ''Psychology and Marketing'', Vol.19(2), February 2002]</ref>  The magazine aims to provoke anti-consumerist epiphanies. By juxtaposing text and images, the magazine creates a means of raising awareness and getting its message out to people that is both aesthetically pleasing and entertaining. <ref name="depts.washington.edu">[http://depts.washington.edu/gcp/pdf/culturejamsandmemewarfare.pdf, "Culture Jams and Meme Warfare: Kalle Lasn, Adbusters, and media activism", Wendi Pickerel, Helena Jorgensen, and Lance Bennett, April 19, 2002]</ref> . 

Activism also takes many other forms such as corporate boycotts and ‘art as protest’, often incorporating humor.  This includes clever billboard modifications, [[google bombing]], [[flash mobs]] and fake parking tickets for [[SUVs]].  A popular example of cultural jamming is the distortion of Tiger Woods’ smile in to the form of the Nike swoosh, calling viewers to question how they view Woods’ persona as a product.  Adbusters calls it "trickle up" activism, and encourages its readers to do these activities by honoring culture jamming work in the magazine. In the September/October 2001 "Graphic Anarchy" issue, Adbusters were culture jammed themselves in a manner of speaking: they hailed the work of Swiss graphic designer [[Ernst Bettler]] as "one of the greatest design interventions on record", unaware that Bettler's story was an elaborate [[hoax]].  . 

===Media Carta===. 
"Media Carta" is a charter challenging the corporate control of the public airwaves and means of communication. The goal is to "make the public airwaves truly public, and not just a corporate domain."<ref name="depts.washington.edu" />  Over 30,000 people have signed the document {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} voicing their desire to reclaim the public space. 
On September 13, 2004, Adbusters filed a lawsuit against six major Canadian television broadcasters (including [[CanWest Global Communications|CanWest Global]], [[Bell Globemedia]], [[CHUM Limited|CHUM Ltd.]], and the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]) for refusing to air Adbusters videos in the [[television commercial]] spots that Adbusters attempted to purchase. Most broadcasters refused the commercials fearing the ads would upset other advertisers as well as violated business principles by “contaminating the purity of media environments designed exclusively for communicating commercial messages”. <ref name="depts.washington.edu" /> The lawsuit claims that Adbusters' [[freedom of expression]] was unjustly limited by the refusals. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2004/09/15/adbusters040915.html | publisher = [[CBC News]] | title=Adbusters Takes Canadian TV Networks to Court | date=September 15, 2004}} {{Dead link|date=April 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> Adbusters believes the public deserves a right to be presented with viewpoints that differ from the standard.  Under Section 3 of the Broadcasting Act, television is a public space allowing ordinary citizens to possess the same rights as advertising agencies and corporations to purchase 30 seconds of airtime from major broadcasters. <ref>[http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Adbusters-Media-Foundation-971292.html, "Adbusters Wins Legal Victory in Ongoing Case Against the CBC and CanWest", www.marketwire.com, April 6, 2009]</ref>  There has been talk that if Adbusters wins in Canadian court, they will file similar lawsuits against major U.S. broadcasters that also refused the [[Advertising|advertisements]]. <ref>[http://www.satyamag.com/may05/lasn.html Satya May 05: Interview with Kalle Lasn of Adbusters<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  [[CNN]] is the only network that has allowed several of the foundation's commercials to run.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} . 

===Legal action===. 
On April 3, 2009, the [[British Columbia Court of Appeal]] unanimously overturned a [[Supreme Court of British Columbia|BC Supreme Court]] ruling that had dismissed the case in February 2008.  The court granted Adbusters the ability to sue the Canadian Broadcasting Company and CanWest Global, the corporations that originally refused to air the anti-car ad “Autosaurus”. The ruling represents a victory for Adbusters, but it is the first step of their intended goal, essentially opening the door for future legal action against the media conglomerates.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  [[Kalle Lasn]] declared the ruling a success and said, "After twenty years of legal struggle, the courts have finally given us permission to take on the media corporations and hold them up to public scrutiny."<ref>Morrow, Fiona (April 6, 2009).  [http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090406.wads0406/BNStory/National/home, Fiona Morrow, "Adbusters Wins Right To Sue Broadcasters over TV Ads"] ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''. </ref> . 

===Digital Detox Week===. 
[[Image:Adbusters DigitalDetox.jpg|thumb|250px|Campaign logo for Digital Detox Week]]
In April 2009, the foundation transformed [[TV Turnoff Week]] into [[Digital Detox Week]], encouraging citizens to spend seven days "unplugged" without any of electronic devices such as video-game systems and computers.  . 

===One Flag===. 
The "One Flag" competition encouraged readers to create a flag that symbolized "global citizenship", without using language or commonly known symbols. <ref>["About Adbusters." Adbusters Culturejammer Headquarters | Journal of the mental environment . 4 Mar. 2009 <http://www.adbusters.org/about/adbusters>.]</ref> . 

==Campaigns==. 
===Culture jamming===. 
[[image:American Corporate Flag.svg|thumb|right|250px|<!-- vector version of the -->American Corporate Flag]]
[[Culture jamming]] is the primary means through which Adbusters challenges consumerism. <ref>Lasn, Kalle (2000). Culture Jam, New York: Quill. </ref> The magazine was described by [[Joseph Heath]] and Andrew Potter in their book ''[[The Rebel Sell]]'' as "the flagship publication of the culture jamming movement."<ref name="rebel">[[Joseph Heath|Heath, Joseph]] and Potter, Andrew. ''[[The Rebel Sell]]''. Harper Perennial, 2004. </ref>  Culture jamming is heavily influenced by the [[Situationist International]] and the tactic of ''[[détournement]]''. The goal is to interrupt the normal consumerist experience in order to reveal the underlying ideology of an advertisement, media message, or consumer artifact. Culture jamming aims to challenge the large, influential corporations that control mainstream media and the flow of information.  It is a form of [[protest]]. The term "jam" contains more than one meaning, including improvising, by re-situating an image or idea already in existence, and interrupting, by attempting to stop the workings of a machine. <ref name="April 1, 2009">[http://www.cordweekly.com/cordweekly/news?news_id=2787, Kari Pritchard, “Questioning Culture”, www.cordweekly.com, April 1, 2009]. </ref> . 

As already noted, the foundation's  approach to culture jamming has its roots in the activities of the [[situationists]] and in particular their concept of ''détournement''. This involves the "turning around" of received messages so that they communicate meanings at variance with their original intention. Situationists argue that consumerism creates “a limitless artificiality”, blurring the lines of reality and detracting from the essence of human experience. <ref name="ReferenceA" />  In the "culture jamming" context, ''détournement'' means taking symbols, logos and slogans that are considered to be the vehicles upon which the "dominant discourse" of "late capitalism" is communicated and changing them&nbsp;&ndash; frequently in significant but minor ways&nbsp;&ndash; to subvert the "monologue of the ruling order" [Debord].  . 

The foundation's activism links grassroots efforts with environmental and social concerns, hoping followers will "reconstruct [their] self through nonconsumption strategies."<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/mar.10006 |title=Consumer Resistance in a World of Advertising Clutter: The Case of ''Adbusters'' |year=2002 | author = Rumbo, Joseph D. |journal=Psychology and Marketing |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=127–48}}</ref>  The foundation is particularly well known for its [[culture jamming]] campaigns,<ref>{{Cite news | author = Willan, Claude |title=We're All Borf in the End |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/22/AR2005072202231_pf.html | work = [[The Washington Post]] |date= July 24, 2005 |accessdate= November 20, 2007 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The campaigns attempt to remove people from the “isolated reality of consumer comforts”. <ref name="depts.washington.edu" /> . 

===Blackspot Shoes campaign===. 
In 2004, the foundation began selling [[vegan]], indy shoes. The name and logo are "open-source";<ref>[http://adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/aboutblackspot.php Blackspot - Blackspot Shoes<!-- Bot generated title -->]. </ref> in other words, unencumbered by private trademarks. <ref>[http://adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/info.php# Blackspot - Blackspot Shoes<!-- Bot generated title -->]. </ref> Attached to each pair was a leaflet - "Rethink the Cool" inviting wearers to join a movement, and two spots - one for drawing their own logos and another on the toe for "kicking corporate ass."<ref>"[http://veganline.com/rethinkthecool.htm "Rethink The Cool" blackspot leaflet transcribed by a retailer]"</ref> . 

There are three versions of the Blackspot Sneaker.  The V1 is designed to resemble the [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]-owned [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars]]. <ref name="independent">{{Cite news |last=Aitch, Iain |title=Kicking against the system |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/politics/article82640.ece |work = [[The Independent]] |date= December 15, 2003 |accessdate= November 20, 2007 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071206133717/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/politics/article82640.ece| archivedate= 6 December 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> There is also a V1 in "fiery red." . 

The V2 is designed by Canadian shoe designer [[John Fluevog]]. It is made from organic [[hemp]] and [[recycled]] car tires.  . 

After an extensive search for anti-sweatshop manufacturers around the world, Adbusters found a small union shop in Portugal. <ref>"[http://adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/info.php About the shoes]", Blackspot website. Retrieved June 2007. </ref> The sale of more than twenty-five thousand pairs<ref name="adbusters.org">[http://adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/info.php Blackspot - Blackspot Shoes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> through an alternative distribution network is an example of Western consumer activism marketing. <ref name="adbusters.org" /> . 

====Reception====. 
Heath and Potter's ''[[The Rebel Sell]]'', which is critical of Adbusters, claimed that the blackspot shoe's existence proves that "no rational person could possibly believe that there is any tension between 'mainstream' and 'alternative' culture."<ref name="rebel" /> . 

In the June 2008 cover story of ''[[Businessweek|BusinessWeek Small Business Magazine]]'', the Blackspot campaign was among three profiled in a piece focusing on "antipreneurs." Two advertising executives were asked to review the campaign for the article's "Ask the Experts" sidebar.  Brian Martin of [[Brand Connections]] and Dave Weaver of [[TM Advertising]] both gave the campaign favorable reviews.  . 

Martin noted that Blackspot was effectively telling consumers, "We know we are marketing to you, and you are as good as we are at this, and your opinion matters," while Weaver stated that "This is not a call to sales of the shoe so much as it is a call to participate in the community of Adbusters by buying the shoe."<ref>{{cite web | title = Meet the Antipreneurs | date = June/July 2008 | work = [[BusinessWeek Small Business Magazine]] | url = http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_66/s0806039879656.htm?chan=search | accessdate = July 31, 2008 }}</ref> . 

===Occupy Wall Street===. 
{{main|Occupy Wall Street}}

Text on the poster reads: "What is our one demand? #OCCUPYWALLSTREET September 17th. Bring Tent."]]
In mid-2011, Adbusters Foundation proposed a peaceful occupation of Wall Street to protest corporate influence on democracy, a growing disparity in wealth, and the absence of legal repercussions behind the recent global financial crisis. <ref name="Fleming">{{cite web|last=Fleming|first=Andrew|title=Adbusters sparks Wall Street protest Vancouver-based activists behind street actions in the U.S|url=http://www.vancourier.com/Adbusters+sparks+Wall+Street+protest/5466332/story.html|publisher=The Vancouver Courier|date=September 27, 2011|accessdate=September 30, 2011}}</ref>  They sought to combine the symbolic location of the 2011 protests in [[Tahrir Square#2011 Egyptian Revolution|Tahrir Square]] with the [[consensus decision making]] of the [[2011 Spanish protests]]. <ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/shira-lazar/micah-white-adbusters-_b_996931.html Sira Lazar “Occupy Wall Street: Interview With [[Micah M.

While the movement was started by Adbusters, the group does not control the movement, and it has since [[Occupy movement|grown worldwide]].  . 

==Criticisms==. 
===Commercial style===. 
The foundation has been criticized for having a style and form that are similar to the media and commercial product that it attacks, that its high gloss design makes the magazine too expensive, and that a style over substance approach is used to mask sub-par content. <ref>McLaren, Carrie. "[http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/9/adbusters.htm Culture Jamming (tm): Brought To You By Adbusters]." ''[[Stay Free!]]''. Retrieved September 13, 2005. </ref> . 

Heath and Potter posit that the more alternative or subversive the foundation feels, the more appealing the Blackspot sneaker will become to the mainstream market. They believe consumers seek exclusivity and social distinction and have argued that the mainstream market seeks the very same brand of individuality that the foundation promotes; thus they see the foundation as promoting capitalist values. <ref name="rebel" /> . 

The Blackspot Shoes campaign has stirred heated debate, as Adbusters admits to using the same marketing techniques which it denounces other companies for using. <ref name="independent" /> . 

===Accusations of antisemitism===. 
<!--Editors wishing to make substantive edits to this section are advised to peruse the relevant discussions that have taken place at the article's Discussion page.-->
In March 2004, ''Adbusters'' was accused of [[antisemitism]] after running an article titled "Why won't anyone say they are Jewish?" The article compiled a list of [[neoconservative]] supporters within the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush Administration]] and marked the names of those it perceived as [[Jewish]] with a black dot. It questioned why, given Israel's role, the political implications of this Jewish neoconservative influence on [[Foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]] in the [[Middle East]] were not a subject of debate. <ref name="AdbustersJewish">{{cite web |url=http://www.adbusters.org/magazine/52/articles/jewish.html |title=Why won't anyone say they are Jewish? |author = [[Kalle Lasn|Lasn, Kalle]] | date = March/April 2004 |publisher=Adbusters |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040223012106/http://www.adbusters.org/magazine/52/articles/jewish.html |archivedate= February 23, 2004 |deadurl=yes |quote=Here at Adbusters, we decided to tackle the issue head on and came up with a carefully researched list of who appear to be the 50 most influential neocons in the US (see above). Deciding who exactly is a neocon is difficult since some neocons reject the term while others embrace it. Some shape policy from within the White House, while others are more peripheral, exacting influence indirectly as journalists, academics and think tank policy wonks. What they all share is the view that the US is a benevolent hyper power that must protect itself by reshaping the rest of the world into its morally superior image. And half of them are Jewish.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite document |last= |first= |title=Adbusters, Max Cleland, and more |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/794ebwmq.asp |publisher=''The Weekly Standard'' |date=8 March 2004 |accessdate=20 November 2007 |postscript= <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

===Ineffective activism===. 
Some critics claim that culture jamming does little to incite real difference. <ref name="April 1, 2009" />  Others declare the movement an easy way for upper- and middle-class citizens to feel empowered by engaging in activism that bears no personal cost, such as the campaign “[[Buy Nothing Day]]”.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} These critics feel a need for “resistance against the causes of capitalist exploitation, not its symptoms”. <ref name="ReferenceA" /> .
