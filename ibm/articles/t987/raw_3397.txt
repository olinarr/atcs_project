{{Anti-consumerism}}
'''Anti-consumerism''' refers to the socio-political movement against the equating of personal happiness with consumption and the purchase of material possessions. The term "consumerism" was first used in 1915 to refer to "advocacy of the rights and interests of consumers" (''Oxford English Dictionary''), but here the term "consumerism" refers to the sense first used in 1960, "emphasis on or preoccupation with the acquisition of consumer goods" (''Oxford English Dictionary''). 
[[Consumerism]] is a term used to describe the effects of the market economy on the individual. Concern over the treatment of consumers has spawned substantial activism, and the incorporation of [[consumer education]] into school [[curriculum|curricula]]. 
Anti-consumerist activism draws parallels with environmental activism, anti-globalization, and animal-rights activism in its condemnation of modern corporations, or organizations that pursue a solely economic interest. One variation on this topic is activism by ''postconsumers'', with the strategic emphasis on moving ''beyond'' addictive consumerism.[http://www.postconsumers.com] . 

In recent years, there have been an increasing number of books (Naomi Klein's 2000 ''[[No Logo]]'' for example) and films (''e.g. [[The Corporation (film)|The Corporation]]'' & ''[[Surplus (film)|Surplus]]''), popularizing an [[Anti-corporate activism|anti-corporate]] [[ideology]] to the public.  . 

Opposition to [[economic materialism]] comes primarily from two sources: [[religion]] and [[social activism]]. Some religions assert materialism interferes with connection between the individual and the [[divinity|divine]], or that it is inherently an [[immorality|immoral]] lifestyle. Some notable individuals, such as [[Francis of Assisi]], [[Ammon Hennacy]], and [[Mohandas Gandhi]] claimed spiritual inspiration led them to a [[simple living|simple lifestyle]]. Social activists believe materialism is connected to [[war]], greed, [[anomie]], [[crime]], environmental degradation, and general social [[malaise]] and discontent. Fundamentally, their concern is that materialism is unable to offer a ''[[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]]'' for human existence. Critics of consumerism include [[Pope Benedict XVI]],<ref>Web log. 17 July 2008. http://babs22.wordpress.com/2008/07/17/australia-pope-attacks-consumerism/</ref> German historian [[Oswald Spengler]] (who said, "Life in America is exclusively economic in structure and lacks depth"<ref name="ReferenceA">Stearns, Peter. ''Consumerism in World History''. Routledge</ref>), and French writer [[Georges Duhamel]], who held "American materialism up as a beacon of mediocrity that threatened to eclipse French civilization". <ref name="ReferenceA"/> . 

==Background==. 
Anti-consumerism is often associated with criticism of consumption, starting with [[Thorstein Veblen]], but according to Veblen's ''[[Theory of the Leisure Class]]'' consumerism can be traced back to the [[Cradle of civilization|first human civilization]]s. Consumerism can also denote economic policies associated with [[Keynesian economics]], and, in an abstract sense, refer to the belief that the free choice of consumers should dictate the economic structure of a society (cf. [[producerism]]).  . 

==Politics and society==.

Many anti-corporate activists believe the rise of large-business corporations poses a threat to the "legitimate" authority of [[nation states]] and the public sphere. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}  They feel corporations are invading people's [[privacy]], manipulating politics and governments, and creating false needs in consumers.  They state evidence such as invasive advertising [[adware]], [[spam (electronic)|spam]], [[telemarketing]], child-targeted advertising, aggressive [[guerrilla marketing]], massive corporate campaign contributions in political elections, interference in the policies of sovereign nation states ([[Ken Saro-Wiwa]]), and news stories about [[corporate corruption]] ([[Enron]], for example).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} . 

Anti-consumerism protesters point out that the main responsibility of a corporation is to answer only to [[shareholders]], giving [[human rights]] and other issues almost no consideration {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}    The management does have a primary responsibility to their shareholders, since any [[philanthropic]] activities that do not directly serve the business could be deemed to be a [[Position of trust|breach of trust]].  This sort of financial responsibility means that multi-national corporations will pursue strategies to intensify labor and reduce costs. For example, they will attempt to find low wage economies with laws which are conveniently lenient on human rights, the [[natural environment]], [[trade union]] organization and so on (see, for example, [[Nike, Inc.#Human rights concerns|Nike]]).  . 

An important contribution to the critique of consumerism has been made by French philosopher [[Bernard Stiegler]], arguing modern capitalism is governed by consumption rather than production, and the advertising techniques used to create [[consumer behaviour]] amount to the destruction of psychic and collective [[individuation]].  The diversion of libidinal energy toward the consumption of consumer products, he argues, results in an addictive cycle of consumption,<ref>http://www.newindpress.com/sunday/sundayitems.asp?id=SEM20060817075601&eTitle=Sunday+Express+%2D+Meanwhile%2E%2E%2E&rLink=0</ref> leading to hyper consumption, the exhaustion of desire, and the reign of symbolic misery. Social and criminological theorists [[Steve Hall]] and [[Simon Winlow]] argue that the libidinally-driven struggle for symbols of social distinction promoted by consumer culture creates narcissistic, hostile relations between individuals, which can be criminogenic in locations where consumer products are difficult to acquire, or where individuals simply see no limit to their acquisition. <ref>Hall, S., Winlow, S. and Ancrum, C. (2008) Criminal Identities and Consumer Culture. London: Routledge</ref> . 

Critics have linked the rise of anti-consumer sentiment to Marxist and socialist ideologies. In 1999, the libertarian magazine ''[[reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' attacked anti-consumerism, claiming [[marxism|Marxist]] academics are repackaging themselves as anti-consumerists. James Twitchell, a professor at the [[University of Florida]] and popular writer, referred to anti-consumerism arguments as "Marxism Lite."<ref>http://www.reason.com/news/show/27795.html</ref> Similarly, philosopher [[Stephen Hicks]]<ref>Hicks, Stephen R.C. Explaining Postmodernism: Skepticism and Socialism from Rousseau to Foucault. Tempe, AZ: Scholargy Publishing, 2004. </ref> argues that anti-consumerist thought comes, in part, from a drastic ''volte face'' in Marxist theory: "[Marxism] presupposed that capitalism would drive the proletariat into economic misery, which capitalism had failed to do. Instead, capitalism had produced great amounts of wealth and-— here is the innovation -— capitalism had used that
wealth to oppress the proletariat..." . 

===Conspicuous consumption===. 
{{Main|Conspicuous consumption}}
{{cquote|It is preoccupation with possessions, more than anything else, that prevents us from living freely and nobly.|x|x| [[Bertrand Russell]]<ref>''The Routledge Dictionary of Quotations'', by Robert Andrews, Routledge, 1987, ISBN 0710207298, pg 212</ref>}} . 

In many critical contexts,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} the term describes the tendency of people to identify strongly with products or services they consume, especially with commercial [[brand]] names and obvious [[status symbol|status-enhancing]] appeal, such as a brand of expensive automobiles or [[jewelry]]. It is a pejorative term which most people deny, having some more specific excuse or [[rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]] for consumption other than the idea that they are "compelled to consume". A culture that has a high amount of consumerism is referred to as a [[consumer culture]].  . 

To those who embrace the idea of consumerism, these products are not seen as valuable in themselves, but rather as social signals that allow them to identify like-minded people through consumption and display of similar products. Few would yet go so far, though, as to admit that their relationships with a product or brand name could be substitutes for healthy human relationships that sometimes lack in a dysfunctional modern [[society]].  . 

The older term ''conspicuous consumption'' described the [[United States]] in the 1960s, but was soon linked to larger debates about [[media influence]], [[culture jamming]], and its corollary [[productivism]].

The term and concept of ''conspicuous consumption'' originated at the turn of the 20th century in the writing of economist [[Thorstein Veblen]]. The term describes an apparently irrational and confounding form of economic behaviour. Veblen's scathing proposal that this unnecessary consumption is a form of status display is made in darkly humorous observations like the following:
{{quote |It is true of dress in even a higher degree than of most other items of consumption, that people will undergo a very considerable degree of privation in the comforts or the necessaries of life in order to afford what is considered a decent amount of wasteful consumption; so that it is by no means an uncommon occurrence, in an inclement climate, for people to go ill clad in order to appear well dressed. <ref>[[The Theory of the Leisure Class]], 1899</ref>}} . 

In 1955, economist [[Victor Lebow]] stated (as quoted by [[William E. Rees (academic)|William Rees]], 2009):
{{quote |"Our enormously productive economy demands that we make consumption our way of life, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek our spiritual satisfaction and our ego satisfaction in consumption. We need things consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate". <ref name=Coghlan/>}} . 

According to archaeologists, evidence of conspicuous consumption up to several millennia ago has been found, suggesting that such behavior is inherent to humans. <ref>{{cite book

===Consumerism and advertising===. 
Anti-consumerists believe [[advertising]] plays a huge role in human life by informing values and assumptions of the cultural system, deeming what is acceptable and determining social standards. <ref name="World. Dir 1997">[ Advertising and the End of the World. Dir. Sut Jhally. Perf. Sut Jhally. DVD. Media Education Foundation , 1997.]</ref>  They declare that ads create a hyper-real world where commodities appear as the key to securing happiness.  Anti-consumerists cite studies that find that individuals believe their quality of life improves in relation to social values that lie outside the capability of the market place.  Therefore, advertising attempts to equate the social with the material by utilizing images and slogans to link commodities with the real sources of human happiness, such as meaningful relationships.  Ads are then a detriment to society because they tell consumers that accumulating more and more possessions will bring them closer to self-actualization, or the concept of a complete and secure being.  “The underlying message is that owning these products will enhance our image and ensure our popularity with others”. <ref>[Tim Kasser, “The High Price of Materialism”, 2002, p.9, Achorn Graphic Services]</ref>   . 

Anti-consumerists claim that in a consumerist society, advertisement images disempower and objectify the consumer. <ref name="Rumbo">Joseph D. Rumbo, “Consumer Resistance in a World of Advertising Clutter: The Case of Adbusters”, Psychology and Marketing, Vol.19(2), February 2002</ref>  By stressing individual power, choice and desire, advertising falsely implies the control lies with the consumer.  Because anti-consumerists believe commodities only supply short-term gratification, they detract from a sustainably happy society.  Further, advertisers have resorted to new techniques of capturing attention, such as the increased speed of ads and [[product placement]]s. <ref name="World. Dir 1997"/>  In this way, commercials infiltrate the consumerist society and become an inextricable part of culture.  Anti-consumerists condemn advertising because it constructs a simulated world that offers fantastical [[escapism]] to consumers, rather than reflecting actual reality.  They further argue that ads depict the interests and lifestyles of the elite as natural; cultivating a deep sense of inadequacy among viewers. <ref name="Rumbo" />  They denounce use of beautiful models because they glamorize the commodity beyond reach of the average individual.  . 

In an opinion segment of ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine published in August 2009, reporter Andy Coghlan cited [[William E. Rees (academic)|William Rees]] of the [[University of British Columbia]] and [[Epidemiology|epidemiologist]] [[Warren Hern]] of the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], saying that human beings, despite considering themselves civilized thinkers, are "subconsciously still driven by an impulse for survival, domination and expansion... an impulse which now finds expression in the idea that inexorable economic growth is the answer to everything, and, given time, will redress all the world's existing inequalities."<ref name=Coghlan>{{cite web

  | title = Consumerism is 'eating the future'
  | url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_templates
  | accessdate = 2009-08-07}}</ref> According to figures presented by Rees at the annual meeting of the [[Ecological Society of America]], human society is in a "global overshoot", consuming 30% more material than is sustainable from the world's resources. Rees went on to state that at present, 85 countries are exceeding their domestic "bio-capacities", and compensate for their lack of local material by depleting the stocks of other countries.  . 

===Alternatives to mainstream economic concepts=== . 

Green movements, but also thinkers from other areas, are opposed to the focus put on economics. The need for terminology has created familiar ideas such as carrying-capacity, and ecological footprint. The forces operating behind such restatements of already existing terminology within economics are less familiar and are those of a critique of the economic system as a whole. Such critique is doomed unless it has the back-up of science, in this case a science operating on the same grounds as economics. Within sociology, some sociologists side with the criticism, but on the whole it is biology that screams loudest. 
Ricardo, an early economist, had ideas that state the finitude of growth, rather than the opposite, his ideas were similar to those of Mark Twain, when he said "buy land, they don´t make it anymore". To Ricardian logic land was a limiting factor. 
The need to reformulate economics in terms that capture these issues (i.e. destruction of the land) are Ricardian type arguments. The 'scientism' presented
by Michel Foucault produced within sociology to oppose controls over the individual, may well be suitable here. This means that control over economics
gives control over environmental hazards. Der Risikogesellschaft (by Ulrich Beck) is the most easily detectable link between concerns of ecology/environmentalism with those of sociology. 
The 'epistemic communities' operating, as in the case of the so-called climate gate reports are scientific,
but also political, this being a suiting example of scientism. A historian of religion, Huston Smith states 'scientism' in similar fashion e.g. p.&nbsp;101 in "The way things are" (ed. Cousineau,2003 UCLA press). See also Criticism of Ricardian theory of trade.  .
