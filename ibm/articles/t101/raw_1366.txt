'''Executive Order 11375''', signed by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on October 13, 1967, banned discrimination on the basis of sex in hiring and employment in both the United States federal workforce and on the part of government contractors.  . 

==Background==. 
During the legislative effort to enact the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], "sex" was not among the categories the bill initially covered. In the House of Representatives, Southern opponents of the legislation, led by Rep. Howard Smith of Virginia, proposed adding "sex" to the original list—race, color, religion, or national origin—in the hope that liberal support for that addition would make the entire bill unacceptable to the bill's more moderate supporters and lead to the bill's defeat. Aware of that strategy, civil rights groups and even the [[American Association of University Women]] opposed the addition, but a coalition of conservative opponents of civil rights legislation and liberal civil rights advocates voted to include "sex" and it survived the legislative process to become part of the law. Authorities charged with responsibility for enforcing the Civil Rights Act focused on racial discrimination and belittled sex-based discrimination. The [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC), charged with enforcing the 1964 act, even decided in 1965 that segregated job advertising—"Help Wanted Male" and "Help Wanted Female"—was permissible because it served "the convenience of readers". <ref>''New York Times'': [http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10D1FF93955157B8EDDA10A94D1405B858AF1D3 John Herbers, "Help Wanted: Picking the Sex for the Job," September 28, 1965], accessed March 25, 2012</ref> Advocates for women's rights founded the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) in June 1966 out of frustration with the enforcement of the sex bias provisions of the Civil Rights Act and Executive Order 11375. <ref>National Organization for Women: [http://www.now.org/history/the_founding.html "The Founding of NOW], accessed March 25, 2012</ref> . 

[[Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr.]], head of the EEOC, counseled patience and pointed out that because of the way the word "sex" had been inserted into the legislation, the EEOC had no legislative history or testimony before Congressional committees to guide it through "a number of very serious problems of interpretation, implementation and jurisdiction."<ref>''New York Times'': [http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FA0D1EFF3C54167A93C1A8178BD95F418685F9 Edith Evans Asbury, "Protest Proposed on Women's Jobs," October 13, 1965], accessed March 25, 2012</ref> NOW and other women's advocacy groups, as well as the President's Citizens Advisory Group on the Status of Women, urged the President to bring government policy with respect to sex discrimination into line with other forms of bias prevention. Assistant Secretary of Labor [[Esther Peterson]] lent support as well. <ref name=acir41>Advisory Committee on Intergovernmental Relations, ''The Evolution of a Problematic Partnership: The Feds and Higher Ed'' (The Federal Role in the Federal System: The Dynamics of Growth, vol. 6, 1981), 41-2, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Ot-72ALM6IIC&pg=PA41& available online], accessed March 24, 2012</ref><ref name=nyt>''New York Times'': [http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F50D1FFE3C59137A93C6A8178BD95F438685F9 Max Frankel, "Johnson Signs Order to Protect Women in U.S. Jobs from Bias," October 14, 1967], accessed March 24, 2012</ref>  . 

On the day Johnson signed Executive Order 11375, [[John Macy|John W. Macy. Jr.]], chairman of the [[Civil Service Commission]], noted that women generated about a third of the complaints his agency received about unfair employment practices, although they represented a modest proportion of the federal workforce. He said women held 658 of the 23,000 jobs paying $18,000 annually, 74 of the 5,000 paying $20,000, 41 of the 2,300 paying $22,000, and 36 of the 17,000 paying $25,000. <ref name=nyt /> . 

==Provisions==. 
This Executive Order added the category "sex" to the anti-discrimination provisions covered in Johnson's earlier [[Executive Order 11246]] of September 24, 1965, which addressed discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin. It went far beyond earlier civil rights legislation. Unlike the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], it applied to those working in administrative, executive, and professional positions. Unlike the the Civil Rights Act's Title VII, it did not exclude teaching personnel. <ref>Advisory Committee on Intergovernmental Relations, ''The Evolution of a Problematic Partnership: The Feds and Higher Ed'' (The Federal Role in the Federal System: The Dynamics of Growth, vol. 6, 1981), 46n47, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Ot-72ALM6IIC&pg=PA46& available online], accessed March 25, 2012</ref> . 

The order provided that the [[Civil Service Commission]] (CSC) would be able to hear complaints of sex-based discrimination from employees of the federal government one month after the order was issued. As of one year after its issuance, it authorized the [[United States Department of Labor|Bureau of Labor]] to investigate and address similar complaints from those employed by government contractors. <ref name=nyt /> . 

==Enforcement==. 
Lobbying of members of Congress on the part of women's groups, notably the [[Women's Equity Action League]] (WEAL), prompted a variety of government agencies to undertake their enforcement obligations. <ref name=acir41 />  . 

When the Labor Department issued details rules as provided for in this Executive Order on June 9, 1970, it defined contractors as any business enterprise with a government contract valued at $50,000 or more and 50 or more employees. Its [[Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs|Office of Federal Contract Compliance]] (OFCC) would oversee enforcement. <ref name=murray272>Pauli Murray, "Economic and Educational Inequality Based on Sex: An Overview," ''Valparaiso University Law Review'', vol. 5, no. 2 (1971), 237-280, 272</ref> Labor's rules included a ban on advertising job openings under the headings "male" and "female" unless the applicant's sex was "a bona fide job qualification" and it banned restricting specific jobs or limiting seniority on the basis of sex. The rules had been recommended by the President's Task Force on Women's Rights and Responsibilities in December 1969. <ref>''New York Times'': [http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F40A15FD3955127B93C2A8178DD85F448785F9 Robert B. Semple, Jr., "Tighter Rules on Job Prejudice Against Women Issued by U.S.," June 10, 1970], accessed March 24, 2012</ref>  . 

Despite the primary role given to Labor in the Executive Order, each agency of the federal government that entered into contracts had responsibility for compliance with OFCC regulations on the part of those who held its contracts. Labor designated the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] as the compliance agency for institutions of higher learning. After HEW gathered statistics and discovered disparities in men's and women's wages and patterns of promotion in higher education, it established a special division devoted to investigating complaints against colleges and universities, the [[Office for Civil Rights|Office of Civil Rights]]<ref name=acir41 /><ref name=lyons>''New York Times'': [http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FB0A17F83F5B137A93CAA9178AD95F448785F9 Richard D. Lyons, "Women Forcing Colleges To Give Job Data to U.S.," November 8, 1970], accessed March 24, 2012</ref> and was assigning field staff as early as July 1968. <ref name=murray272 /> Discrimination in higher education was sufficiently highlighted that Congress addressed it in the Education Amendments of 1972, the landmark legislation known as [[Title IX]].  . 

Though OFCC regulations required the creation of "goals and timetables" for affirmative actions to remedy past discriminatory employment practices, government officials hesitated to apply them to sex as they did to race. Secretary of Labor [[James Day Hodgson|James Hodgson]] told a group of ten advocates for women on July 25, 1970 that "employment problems of women are different". <ref name=murray274>Murray, "Economic and Educational Inequality," 274</ref> He allowed that sex-based discrimination was "subtle and more pervasive than against any other minority group. <ref name=nytset>''New York Times'': [http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F60F10FA345A1B7493C3A91783D85F448785F9 "Federal Contracts to Set Job Equality for Women," August 1, 1970], accessed March 25, 2012</ref> In response, women's groups mounted demonstrations in more than a dozen cities. <ref name=murray274 /> On July 31, Hodgson attempted to clarify his remarks, endorsing in principle the idea of "goals and timetables" for relieving sex discrimination, but saying that the procedures for establishing them with respect to other forms of discrimination were "not sufficient to meet the more difficult and elusive problem of sex discrimination."<ref name=murray275>Murray "Economic and Educational Inequality," 275</ref> He explained that: "The work force pattern of women and racial minorities differs in significant respects. Many women do not seek employment. Practically all adult males do. Many occupations sought after by all racial groups have not been sought by women in significant numbers."<ref name=nytset /> He promised "immediate consultations" within two weeks with interested parties. <ref name=nytset /> Advisory committees were set to meet in May 1971. <ref name=murray275 /> . 

Under the authority and direction of this Executive Order, the Civil Service Commission established the [[Federal Women's Program]] to implement programs to ensure women's employment and advancement in the federal workforce. <ref>Helene S. Markoff, "The Federal Women's Program," ''Public Administration Review'', vol. 32, no. 2 (March-April, 1972), 145</ref> . 

This Executive Order provided the basis for the federal government's investigation of the hiring practices than 2,000 colleges and universities, following complaints in the spring of 1970 against 150 institutions by the WEAL and NOW. A government official said about a dozen had been denied funds for failing to comply with requests for employment records and that all but three eventually complied. Dr. [[Bernice Sandler]] of the Equity Action League commented: "After all, there are no Federal laws dealing with sex discrimination. That's why we are forcing the issue by filing complaints under the terms of the executive order." She said her organization had filed complaints against the California state system, [[Columbia University]] and others, and that investigations were active at [[Harvard University]], [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola of Chicago]], [[George Washington University]], and others. <ref name=lyons /><ref>Murray, "Economic and Educational Inequality," 272-3</ref> She explained that she had come upon the Executive Order accidentally:<ref>''New York Times'': [http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00815FC3C5E127A93C3AB178AD95F458785F9 Nancy Hicks, "Women on College Faculties are Pressing for Equal Pay and Better Positions in Academic Hierarchy," November 21, 1971], accessed March 24, 2012</ref>
{{quote|I was reading the 1965 Executive order and happened to see an asterisk. Since I am an academic person, I read the footnote and saw that the order was amended in 1968 {{sic}} to include women.

By the late 1970's, the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration was using the rules established under Executive Order 11375 against large businesses like [[United States Rubber Company|Uniroyal]], which had sex-segregated manufacturing facilities. Most companies went to court to obstruct the government's attempts to monitor and regulate their hiring practices and decisions. Only [[General Dynamics]] and [[United Airlines]] negotiated settlements. <ref>''New York Times'': [http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F60A1FFE3B5413728DDDAF0A94DD405B888BF1D3 Janet Battaile, "Business Resisting U.S. on Job-Bias Issue," May 26, 1978], accessed March 24, 2012</ref> .
