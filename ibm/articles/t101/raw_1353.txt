In [[critical race theory]], '''white privilege''' is a way of conceptualizing racial inequalities that focuses as much on the advantages that [[white people]] accrue from society as on the disadvantages that [[people of color]] experience. White privilege may be defined as the "unearned advantages of being White in a racially stratified society", and has been characterized as an expression of institutional power that is largely unacknowledged by most White individuals <ref> Neville, H., Worthington, R., Spanierman, L. (2001).Race, Power, and Multicultural Counseling Psychology: Understanding White Privilege and Color Blind Racial Attitudes. In Ponterotto, J., Casas, M, Suzuki, L, and Alexander, C.(Eds) Handbook of Multicultural Counseling, Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE. </ref>. Most such theories focus on American and European societal condition, since inequality between whites and non-whites is a long-standing feature of these academic areas.  White privilege differs from conditions of overt [[racism]] or [[prejudice]], in which a dominant group actively seeks to oppress or suppress other racial groups for its own advantage.  Instead, theories of white privilege suggest that whites view their social, cultural, and economic experiences as a [[norm (sociology)|norm]] that everyone should experience, rather than as an advantaged position that must be maintained at the expense of others.  This [[normative]] assumption implicitly constrains discussions of racial inequality within the dominant discourse: such explanations are limited to factors specific to disadvantaged racial groups - who are viewed as having failed to achieve the norm - and solutions focus on what can be done to help those groups achieve the 'normal' standards experienced by whites.  . 

In essence, theories of white privilege assert that discourses on racial inequality do not truly discuss differences between white and non-white social status, but only discuss the failure of non-white groups to achieve ''normal'' social status, effectively turning race into an issue that does not involve whites. In this sense it is similar to [[confirmation bias]]es and the [[fundamental attribution error]] in social psychology.  . 

The general claim of theories of white privilege is that racial inequity cannot be resolved ''solely'' by looking at the life conditions of disadvantaged groups.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} They suggest that solutions to problems of racial inequality can only be achieved by explicitly discussing the implicit advantages that whites as a group hold in society.  . 

==Overview==. 
Scholars within the [[law|legal]] studies [[List of academic disciplines|field]] of [[critical race theory]], such as Cheryl Harris<ref name="Harris">{{cite journal |first=Cheryl I. |last=Harris|title=Whiteness as Property |journal=Harvard Law Review |volume=106 |issue=8|pages=1709–95 |date=June 1993 |doi=10.2307/1341787 |publisher=Harvard Law Review, Vol. 106, No. 8|jstor=1341787}}</ref> and George Lipsitz,<ref>{{cite book |first=George |last=Lipsitz |title=The Possessive Investment in Whiteness: How White People Profit from Identity Politics
|publisher=Temple University Press |year=1998 |isbn=1566396352}}</ref> have argued that "whiteness" has historically been treated more as a form of [[property]] than as a racial characteristic: In other words, as an object which has intrinsic value that must be protected by social and legal institutions.  Laws and [[mores]] concerning race (from [[apartheid]] and [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] constructions that legally separate different races to social prejudices against interracial relationships or mixed communities) serve the purpose of retaining certain advantages and privileges for whites. Because of this, academic and societal ideas about race have tended to focus solely on the disadvantages suffered by [[racial minorities]], overlooking the advantageous effects that accrue to whites. <ref name="Lucal">{{cite journal|last=Lucal|first=Betsy|date=July 1996|title=Oppression and Privilege: Toward a Relational Conceptualization of Race|journal=Teaching Sociology|publisher=American Sociological Association|location=Washington, D.C.|volume=24|issue=3|pages=245–55|issn=0092055X|oclc=48950428|doi=10.2307/1318739|jstor=1318739}}</ref> . 

Within an educational context, Dan J. Pence and J. Arthur Fields observe resistance to the idea that white privilege of this type exists, and suggest this resistance stems from a tendency to see inequality as a black or [[Latino]] issue.

Heidi A. Zetzer categorizes white privilege as an "institutional and individual manifestation of racism, however indirectly or unintentionally."<ref>Zetzer, H.A. (2005). White Out: Privilege and Its Problems. In S.K. Anderson & V.A. Middleton (eds.), Explorations in Privilege, Oppression, and Diversity (pp. 5). Belmont, California: Thomson Brooks/Cole. </ref> Zetzer argues the indirectness of white privilege is what makes it so prevalent. If people are not educated about white privilege, it is unlikely that they will take note of it. Whites who are aware of it suffer under the stigma of benefiting from an unfair system. Zetzer asks "How can I see myself as a just person when I willingly participate in a system that is inherently unfair?" The guilt formed by this opinion creates a spirit of inactivity in solving the problem. "White guilt", as Zetzer deems it, is an impediment to change. Zetzer argues that honest and multicultural dialogue is the first way to build alliances which can then "transform people and systems and turn intention into action,"<ref>Zetzer, H.A. (2005).

==White privilege in the United States==. 
=== History ===. 
In his 1935 ''[[Black Reconstruction|Black Reconstruction in America]]'', [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] wrote that “in black slavery and Reconstruction” could be found “the kernel and meaning of the labor movement in the United States.” <ref>W. E. B. Du Bois, ''Black Reconstruction in America, 1860–1880'' (New York: Free Press, 1995 reissue of 1935 original), p. 353. ISBN 0684856573. </ref>  Then, in 1965, drawing from that insight, and inspired by the Civil Rights movement, Theodore W. Allen began a pioneering forty-year analysis of “white skin privilege,” “”white race” privilege, and “white” privilege in a call he drafted for a “John Brown Commemoration Committee” that urged “White Americans who want government of the people” and “by the people” to “begin by first repudiating their white skin privileges.”<ref>Theodore W. Allen, “A Call . . . John Brown Memorial Pilgrimage . . . December 4, 1965,” John Brown Commemoration Committee, 1965 and Jeffrey B. Perry, "The Developing Conjuncture and Some Insights from Hubert Harrison and Theodore W. Allen on the Centrality of the Fight against White Supremacy," “Cultural Logic” 2010, at http://clogic.eserver.org/2010/2010.html </ref>  The groundbreaking pamphlet, "White Blindspot," authored by Allen and Noel Ignatin [Noel Ignatiev] in the late 1960s focused on the struggle against "white skin privilege” and significantly influenced Students for a Democratic Society and sectors of the “new left.”<ref> See Noel Ignatin (Ignatiev) and Ted (Theodore W.) Allen, “‘White Blindspot’ &“Can White Workers Radicals Be Radicalized?’” (Detroit: The Radical Education Project and New York: NYC Revolutionary Youth Movement, 1969) and Perry, "The Developing Conjuncture and Some Insights from Hubert Harrison and Theodore W. Allen. . . "</ref>. In 1974-1975 Allen extended his analysis to the colonial period with his ground-breaking "Class Struggle and the Origin of Racial Slavery: The Invention of the White Race" in 1974/1975 <ref> Theodore W. Allen, Class Struggle and the Origin of Racial Slavery: The Invention of the White Race (Hoboken: Hoboken Education Project, 1975), republished in 2006 with an “Introduction” by Jeffrey B. Perry at Center for the Study of Working Class Life, SUNY, Stony Brook, at http://clogic.eserver.org/2006/allen.html. </ref>, which ultimately grew into his seminal two-volume "The Invention of the White Race" in 1994 and 1997. <ref> Theodore W. Allen, The Invention of the White Race, Vol. I: Racial Oppression and Social Control (New York: Verso, 1994, ISBN 0-0086091-660-x) and Vol. II: The Origin of Racial Oppression in Anglo-America (New York: Verso, 1997, ISBN 1859840760). </ref> Allen’s work consistently argued that “white” privileges were not only not in the interests of direct victims of white supremacy, they were also not in the class interests of working-class European-Americans and that they should be struggled against and “repudiated” by European-Americans.  . 

In his 1935 ''[[Black Reconstruction|Black Reconstruction in America]]'', [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] first described the "psychological wages" of whiteness: . 

<blockquote>It must be remembered that the white group of laborers, while they received a low wage, were compensated in part by a sort of public and psychological wage. They were given public deference and titles of courtesy because they were white. They were admitted freely with all classes of white people to public functions, public parks, and the best schools. The police were drawn from their ranks, and the courts, dependent on their votes, treated them with such leniency as to encourage lawlessness. Their vote selected public officials, and while this had small effect upon the economic situation, it had great effect upon their personal treatment and the deference shown them. White schoolhouses were the best in the community, and conspicuously placed, and they cost anywhere from twice to ten times as much per capita as the colored schools. The newspapers specialized on news that flattered the poor whites and almost utterly ignored the Negro except in crime and ridicule. <ref>W. E. B. Du Bois, ''Black Reconstruction in America, 1860–1880'' (New York: Free Press, 1995 reissue of 1935 original), pp. 700–701. ISBN 0684856573. </ref></blockquote> . 

This concept was later taken up by David Roediger in his 1999 book, ''The Wages of Whiteness: Race and the Making of the American Working Class''. <ref>''
[http://www.historymatters.appstate.edu/documents/wagesofwhiteness.pdf The Wages of Whiteness: Race and the Making of the American Working Class]'' a book review. </ref>  Theorists associated with the journal ''[[Race Traitor (publication)|Race Traitor]]'', such as editor [[Noel Ignatiev]], argue that whiteness (as a marker of a social status within the United States) is conferred upon people in exchange for an expectation of loyalty to an oppressive social order. This loyalty has taken a variety of forms over time: suppression of slave rebellions, support of whites-only [[trade union|union]]s, and promotion for police brutality. Like currency, the value of this privilege depends on the reliability of a white appearance as a marker for social consent. These theorists argue that with enough "counterfeit whites" resisting racism and capitalism, the privilege of whiteness will be withdrawn and prompt an era of social redefinition.{{clarify|date=December 2010}} Without such a period, they argue, progress towards social justice is impossible.  . 

The theory of White privilege in America may be seen as having its roots in the system of legalized discrimination that existed for much of American history.{{Clarify|date=January 2010}}<ref>

Some historians and authors, including Noel Ignatiev and Karen Brodkin, discuss the historical trajectory from exclusion to acceptance of Irish and Jewish émigrés in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in terms of white privilege.

===Wealth===. 
According to Roderick Harrison "wealth is a measure of cumulative advantage or disadvantage" and "the fact that black and Hispanic wealth is a fraction of white wealth also reflects a history of discrimination". <ref>"[http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/18/national/18wealth.html Study Says White Families' Wealth Advantage Has Grown]."

Thomas Shapiro argues that wealth is passed along from generation to generation, giving whites a better "starting point" in life than other races. According to Shapiro many whites receive financial assistance from their parents allowing them to live beyond their income. This, in turn, enables them to buy houses and major assets which aid in the accumulation of wealth. Since houses in white neighborhoods appreciate faster, even African Americans who are able to overcome their "starting point" are unlikely to accumulate wealth as fast as whites. Shapiro asserts this is a continual cycle from which whites consistently benefit. <ref name="Shapiro">{{cite book |first=Thomas M. |last=Shapiro |title=The Hidden Cost of Being African American; How Wealth Perpetuates Inequality |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195181388|date=2003-12-12}}</ref> These benefits also have effects on schooling and other life opportunities.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} .

=== Employment and economics ===. 
Racialized employment networks can benefit whites at the expense of blacks. <ref name="Royster">{{cite book |first=Deirdre A. |last=Royster |title=Race and the Invisible Hand |location=Los Angeles |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0520239512 |year=2003}}</ref> In a study published in 2003, sociologist Deirdre A. Royster compared black and white males who graduated from the same school with the same skills.  In looking at their success with school-work transition and working experiences, she found that white graduates were more often employed in skilled trades, earned more, held higher status positions, received more promotions and experienced shorter periods of unemployment. Since all other factors were similar, the differences in employment experiences were attributed to race.  Royster concluded that the primary cause of these racial differences was due to [[social networking]]. The concept of "who you know" seemed just as important to these graduates as "what you know." . 

Since older white males predominantly control blue-collar trades, they are more likely to offer varying forms of assistance to those in their social network, often other whites.  Assistance can be anything from job vacancy information, referrals, direct job recruitment, formal and informal training, and vouching behavior and leniency in supervision.  This assistance disproportionately available to whites is an advantage that often puts black men at a disadvantage in the employment sector, "these ideologies provide a contemporary deathblow to working-class black men's chances of establishing a foothold in the traditional trades."<ref name="Royster" /> . 

This concept is similar to the theory created by [[Mark Granovetter]] which analyzes the importance of social networking and [[interpersonal ties]] with his paper ''"The Strength of Weak Ties"'' and his other economic sociology work.  .

Discrimination in housing policies was formalized in 1934 under the Federal Housing Act which provided government credit to private lending for home buyers.  Within the Act, the Federal Housing Agency had the authority to channel all the money to white home buyers instead of minorities.  The FHA also channeled money away from inner-city neighborhoods after World War II and instead placed it in the hands of white home buyers who would move into segregated suburbs. <ref>{{cite book  |first=Paula S. |last=Rothenberg |year=2005 |title=White Privilege |location=New York |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=0716787334}}</ref>  These practices and others, intensified attitudes of segregation and inequality.  .

*Whites are offered more choices; 60%–90% of housing units shown to whites are not brought to the attention of blacks. 
*72.1% of whites own their own home opposed to 48.1% for African Americans
*46% of whites had help from their family in making down payments on homes compared to 12% for African Americans
*Whites are half as likely to be turned down for a mortgage or home improvement loan
*Whites pay on average a 8.12% interest rate on their mortgage, lower than the 8.44% African Americans pay on average
*The median home equity for whites is $58,000 compared to $40,000 for African Americans . 

=== Education ===. 
According to Wildman, education policies<sup>[which level?]</sup> in the US have contributed to the construction and reinforcement of white privilege. <ref>Wildman, Stephanie M. "The Persistence of White Privilege." 18 Mar 2010. <[https://law.wustl.edu/journal/18/p245Wildmanbookpages.pdf https://law.wustl.edu/journal/18/p245Wildmanbookpages.pdf]>. </ref> Wildman argues that even schools that appear to be integrated often segregate students based on abilities. This can increase white students' initial educational advantage, magnifying the "unequal classroom experience of African American students" and minorities. <ref>{{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Shapiro |year=2004 |title=The Hidden Cost of Being African American; How Wealth Perpetuates Inequality |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=144 |isbn=9780195181388}}</ref> . 

It is argued that the material that black and other minority children are tested on in school is  often culturally biased, not taking into consideration dialect and other differences between populations. Williams and Rivers (1972b) showed that test instructions in Standard English disadvantaged the black child and that if the language of the test is put in familiar labels without training or coaching, the child's performances on the tests increase significantly. <ref>Williams, R.L. and Rivers, L.W. (1972b). The use of standard and nonstandard English in testing black children. As presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Psychological Association</ref> According to Cadzen a child's language development should be evaluated in terms of his progress toward the norms for his particular speech community. <ref>Cadzen, C.B.

According to Janet E. Helms traditional psychological and academic assessment is based on skills that are considered important within white, western, middle-class culture, but which may not be salient or valued within African-American culture. <ref>Helms, J.E.

Educational inequality is also a consequence of housing.  Since most states determine school funding based on property taxes,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} schools in wealthier neighborhoods receive more funding per student.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}  As home values in white neighborhoods are higher than minority neighborhoods,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} local schools receive more funding via property taxes. This will ensure better technology in predominantly white schools, smaller class sizes and better quality teachers, giving white students opportunities for a better education. <ref>{{cite journal |first=Erin E. |last=Kelly |year=1995 |title=All Students Are Not Created Equal: The Inequitable Combination of Property Tax-Based School Finance Systems and Local Control |journal=Duke Law Journal |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=397–435 |doi=10.2307/1372907 |publisher=Duke Law Journal, Vol. 45, No. 2 |jstor=1372907 }}</ref> The vast majority of schools placed on academic probation as part of district accountability efforts are majority African-American and low-income. <ref>Diamond, John B. & James P. Spillane. (2004) "High Stakes Accountability in Urban Elementary Schools: Challenging or Reproducing Inequality?" Teachers College Record, Special Issue on Testing, Teaching, and Learning. 106(6): 1140–1171. </ref> However, Congress enacted the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2001 to address such school performance disparities. That act provides for a large increase in federal school aid to address property tax disparities and gives parents the right to switch schools if their neighborhood school fails to progress to meet national performance standards.  . 

Inequalities in wealth and housing allow a higher proportion of white parents the option to move to better school districts or afford to put their children in private schools if they don’t approve of the neighborhood's schools. <ref>{{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Shapiro |year=2004 |title=The Hidden Cost of Being African American; How Wealth Perpetuates Inequality |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=157 |isbn=9780195181388}}</ref> .

[[Conservatism in the United States|Conservative]] scholar and opponent of affirmative action programs, [[Shelby Steele]] at the [[Hoover Institution]], believes that the effects of white privilege are exaggerated. Steele argues that irresponsibility is a larger problem for blacks, who may incorrectly blame their personal failures on white oppression. He also argues that there are many "minority privileges": "If I'm a black high school student today... there are white American institutions, universities, hovering over me to offer me opportunities: Almost every institution has a [[multiculturalism|diversity]] committee... There is a hunger in this society to do right racially, to not be racist."<ref name=abc>{{cite news|title=Does White Privilege Exist in America?

=== Self-image ===. 
[[Beverly Daniel Tatum]] writes that most white people do not think to [[self-image|describe themselves]] as "white" when listing descriptive terms about themselves, whereas people of color usually use racial or ethnic identity descriptors. Tatum suggests this is because the elements of one's identity that are congruent with the dominant culture are so normalized and reflected back at one that one is apt to take such traits for granted. This is not the case for identity aspects of those who are defined as "other" by the dominant culture, whether it be on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or other microcultural aspects. <ref name="Tatum"/> The true reasons behind this occurrence are unknown, but may also be due to many different unspoken psychological effects on minorities and majorities alike, whether it be pride, shame, or an environmental stimulation such as a rally. Tatum writes that dominant microcultures (in this case, white people) set the parameters in which "subordinate" microcultures operate. Subordinate groups are often labeled as substandard in significant ways: e.g., blacks have historically been characterized as less intelligent than whites. <ref name="Tatum"/> Subordinates are also defined as being innately incapable of being able to perform the preferred roles in society. <ref name="Tatum"/>  . 

[[Alik Shahadah]] claims that the image of Africa imposed on the world are those created and controlled by white forces and that globalization is therefore in his view not only an imposition of products but also of ideas and ideals, at the expense of the broader human diversity. <ref name="The Removal of Agency from Africa">{{cite web | url=http://www.africanholocaust.net/news_ah/agencyandafrica.htm | title= The Removal of Agency from Africa  | publisher=[[Owen Alik Shahadah]], African Holocaust Society | accessdate=2007-01-04}}</ref><ref name="Pambazuka Online">{{cite web | url=http://www.pambazuka.org/en/category/features/42249 | title= Pambazuka Online | publisher=[[Pambazuka]] | African agency.}}</ref> . 

The use of [[skin whitening]] treatments by [[people of color]] has been linked to the benefits of white privilege. According to several theorists the relationship between white privilege and skin whitening is explained by [[colorism]] and [[colonial mentality]]. <ref>{{cite news|title=Brown is Beautiful|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=11261|author=Llewelyn Muriel Austria-del Rosario}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Mestizaje and Self-Hate|url=http://www.mexika.org/Mestizo.html|author=Victor Mejia}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=April 2008}}<ref name="The Removal of Agency from Africa"/><ref name="Pambazuka Online"/> .
