'''Second-class citizen''' is an informal term used to describe a person who is systematically [[discrimination|discriminated]] against within a [[State (polity)|state]] or other [[Political division|political jurisdiction]], despite their nominal status as a citizen or legal resident there. While not necessarily [[slaves]], [[civil death|outlaws]] or [[criminals]], second-class citizens have limited legal rights, civil rights and economic opportunities, and are often subject to mistreatment or neglect at the hands of their putative superiors. Instead of being protected by the law, the law disregards a second-class citizen, or it may actually be used to [[harassment|harass]] them. (see [[police misconduct]] and [[racial profiling]])
Second-class citizenry is generally regarded as a violation of human rights. Typical impediments facing second-class citizens include, but are not limited to, [[disenfranchisement]] (a lack or loss of voting rights), limitations on [[civil service|civil]] or [[military]] service (not including [[conscription]] in every case), as well as restrictions on [[language]], [[religion]], [[education]], freedom of movement and association, weapons ownership, [[marriage]], [[Gender Identity|gender identity and expression]], [[House|housing]] and [[property|property ownership]].  . 

The term is generally used as a [[pejorative]] or in the context of [[civil society]] [[activism]] and governments will typically deny the existence of a second class within the [[polity]]. As an informal term, second-class citizenship is not objectively measured; however, cases such as the [[American South]] under [[Racial segregation|segregation]], [[apartheid]] in [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]] in [[Northern Ireland]] during the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|parliamentary]] era and the marginalization of other religious and ethnic minorities, women, men, non-custodial parents, low to mid income parents who cannot afford a lawyer and have their children taken away by Child Protective Services, LGBT people, and other minorities in many countries worldwide, have been historically described as creating second-class citizenry.  . 

By contrast, a '''[[resident alien]]''' or '''foreign national''' may have limited rights within a jurisdiction (such as not being able to vote, and having to register with the government), but is also given the law's protection{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}, and is usually accepted by the local population{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. A [[naturalized]] citizen carries essentially the same rights and responsibilities as any other citizen (a possible exception being ineligibility for certain public offices), and is also legally protected.  . 

A proposed American [[guest worker program]] has been criticized as creating second-class citizens. <ref>http://www.tnr.com/article/thats-hospitality</ref> The term has been used to refer to [[Arab Israelis]].  .
