'''Equal opportunity''' is a stipulation that all people should be treated similarly, unhampered by artificial barriers or prejudices or preferences, except when particular “distinctions can be explicitly justified.”<ref name=twsL19/> The aim according to this often "complex and contested concept"<ref name=twsL18/> is that important jobs should go to those “most qualified” – persons most likely to perform ably in a given task – and not to go to persons for arbitrary or irrelevant reasons, such as circumstances of birth, upbringing, friendship ties to whoever is in power,<ref name=twsH11/> religion, sex,<ref name=twsL25/> ethnicity,<ref name=twsL25>{{cite news

Generally the terms “equality of opportunity” and “equal opportunity” are interchangeable, with occasional slight variations: “equality of opportunity” has more of a sense of being an abstract political concept, while “equal opportunity” is sometimes used as an adjective, usually in the context of employment regulations, to identify an employer, a hiring approach, or law. Equal opportunity provisions have been written into regulations and have been debated in courtrooms. <ref name=twsH44>{{cite news

===Outlines of the concept===. 
[[File:FactoryProcessing.png|thumb|300px|right|In a factory setting, equality of opportunity is often seen as a procedural fairness along the lines of "if you assemble twice as many lamps, you'll be paid double". In this sense, the concept is in contrast to the concept of [[equality of outcome]] which might require that all workers be paid similarly regardless of how many lamps they made.]]
According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', the concept assumes that society is stratified with a diverse range of roles, some of which are more desirable than others. <ref name=twsH11/> And the benefit of equality of opportunity is to bring fairness to the selection process for coveted roles in [[corporations]], [[Voluntary association|associations]], [[nonprofit organizations|nonprofits]], [[universities]], and elsewhere. <ref name=twsL11>{{cite news

===Basic model===. 
[[File:Martin Luther King - March on Washington.jpg|thumb|right|350px|American [[civil rights]] leader [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] was a staunch advocate of ''equal opportunity''. Photo: King making his famous ''[[I Have A Dream]]'' speech in Washington, D.C. in 1963.]]
People generally think of equality of opportunity in terms of the rules of a certain society and in situations where there is a certain job to be filled. For example, a call goes out for people to apply for a specific job. All persons who might be interested in this job learn about it, that is, they are informed in some way that the position is available. Then, they indicate that they want to apply for this position – all eligible people should have a chance to compete for this job. At this point the evaluation stage begins – this is the official ''starting point''. The competition is often thought of using the [[metaphor]] of a running race. <ref name=twsH77d33>{{cite news

}}</ref> Next, there is a formal process to determine which applicant gets the job, and this selection process should be related to what the job is about, that is, the evaluation should consider the "qualifications deemed relevant to successful performance in a position or program."<ref name=twsL13/> For example, if a firefighter position is open, then applicants may have to demonstrate their ability to carry a heavy sack up a flight of stairs; if a professor's post is open, then applicants may have to show that they have the requisite degrees. But the process of assigning "individuals to places in the social hierarchy is determined by some form of competitive process."<ref name=twsH11/> The selection process should not be based on some arbitrary or irrelevant criterion such as [[religion]] or [[skin color]], but rather should emphasize "individual abilities and ambition"<ref name=twsL13/> or, as [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] said in his famous ''[[I Have a Dream]]'' speech that he hoped his four children would be judged not by the "color of their skin but by the content of their character." <ref name=twsL19/> Then, from this "starting gate" position, regardless of the particular view of equality of opportunity, applicants are seen as essentially accountable for the results from that point onwards – whether they succeed or fail is up to their own ability at this point. <ref name=twsH74/> And one applicant gets the job. In a usual conception, equality of opportunity logically implies unequal results afterwards, so there is support for the view that equality of opportunity and equality of outcome are philosophically incompatible.  .

====Formal equality of opportunity====. 
[[File:Diagram of equal opportunity formal model.png|thumb|450px|]]
''Formal equality of opportunity'',<ref name=twsL18/> sometimes referred to as the ''nondiscrimination principle''<ref name=twsH74/> or described as the absence of ''direct discrimination'',<ref name=twsL18/> or described in the narrow sense as ''equality of access'',<ref name=twsL18/><ref>Cashmore, Ellis, Dictionary of Race and Ethnic Relations, London: Routledge, 1996</ref> is characterized by: . 

#'''Open call.''' Positions bringing superior advantages should be open to all applicants;<ref name=twsL21/> job openings should be publicized in advance giving applicants a "reasonable opportunity" to apply. Further, all applications should be accepted. <ref name=twsH11/>
#'''Fair judging.''' Applications should be judged on their merits<ref name=twsH11/> with procedures designed to identify those best-qualified. <ref name=twsL21/> The evaluation of the applicant should be in accord with the duties of the position; for example, for the job opening of choir director, the evaluation may judge applicants based on musical knowledge rather than some arbitrary criterion such as hair color. <ref name=twsH11/>
#'''An application is chosen.''' The applicant judged as "most qualified" is offered the position while others are not. There is agreement that the result of the process is again unequal, in the sense that one person has the position while another does not, but that this outcome is deemed fair on procedural grounds.  . 

The ''formal'' approach is seen as a somewhat basic "no frills" or "narrow"<ref name=twsL13/> approach to equality of opportunity, a minimal standard of sorts, limited to the [[public sphere]] as opposed to private areas such as the [[family]], [[marriage]], or [[religion]]. <ref name=twsL13/> What is considered "fair" and "unfair" is spelled out in advance. <ref name=twsL17>{{cite news

This term, sometimes called ''fair equality of opportunity'',<ref name=twsL21/> is a somewhat broader<ref name=twsL13/> and more expansive concept than the more limiting ''formal'' equality of opportunity and it deals with what is sometimes described as ''indirect discrimination''. <ref name=twsL18/> It goes farther, and is more controversial<ref name=twsL13/> than the ''formal'' variant, and has been thought to be much harder to achieve, with greater disagreement about how to achieve greater equality,<ref name=twsL13/> and has been described as "unstable",<ref name=twsL21/> particularly if the society in question is unequal to begin with in terms of great disparity of wealth. <ref name=twsH19>{{cite news

In the ''substantive'' approach, the ''starting point'' before the race begins is unfair, since people have had differing experiences ''before'' even approaching the competition. The ''substantive'' approach examines the applicants themselves before applying for a position, and judges whether they have equal abilities or talents, and if not, then it suggests that authorities (usually the government) take steps to make applicants more equal ''before'' they get to the point where they compete for a position, and fixing the before-the-starting-point issues has sometimes been described as working towards "fair access to qualifications."<ref name=twsL21/> It seeks to remedy inequalities perhaps because of an "unfair disadvantage" based sometimes on "prejudice in the past."<ref name=twsL23/> According to John Hills, children of wealthy and well-connected parents usually have a decisive advantage over other types of children, and he notes that "advantage and disadvantage reinforce themselves over the life cycle, and often on to the next generation" so that successful parents pass along their wealth and education to succeeding generations, making it difficult for others to climb up a social ladder. <ref name=twsH14>{{cite news

In a sense, substantive equality of opportunity moves the "starting point" further back in time. Sometimes it entails the use of [[affirmative action]] policies to help all contenders become equal before they get to the starting point, perhaps with greater training, or sometimes redistributing resources via [[coercion]] or [[taxation]] to make the contenders more equal. It holds that all who have a "genuine opportunity to become qualified" be given a chance to do so. And it is sometimes based on a recognition that unfairness exists, hindering [[social mobility]], combined with a sense that the unfairness should not exist or should be lessened in some manner. <ref name=twsH13>{{cite news

The ''substantive'' position was advocated by Bhikhu Parekh in 2000 in ''Rethinking Multiculturalism'' who wrote that "all citizens should enjoy equal opportunities to acquire the capacities and skills needed to function in society and to pursue their self-chosen goals equally effectively" and that "equalising measures are justified on grounds of justice as well as social integration and harmony."<ref name=twsL18/><ref>Parekh, Bhikhu, Rethinking Multiculturalism.

[[Affirmative action]] programs usually fall under the ''substantive'' category. <ref name=twsL13/> The idea is to help disadvantaged groups get back to a normal starting position after a long period of [[discrimination]]. The programs involve government action, sometimes with resources being transferred from an advantaged group to a disadvantaged one, and these programs have been justified on the grounds that imposing [[:wikt:Quota|quota]]s counter-balances the past discrimination<ref name=twsH11/> as well as being a "compelling state interest" in diversity in society. <ref name=twsL13/> For example, there was a case in [[Sao Paulo, Brazil|Sao Paulo]] in [[Brazil]] of a quota imposed on the [[São Paulo Fashion Week]] to require that "at least 10 percent of the models to be black or indigenous", as a coercive measure to counteract a "longstanding bias towards white models."<ref name=twsH43>{{cite news

Some theorists have posed a ''level playing field'' conception of equality of opportunity,<ref name=twsH11/><ref name=twsL21/> similar in many respects to the ''substantive'' principle, (although it has been used in different contexts to describe ''formal'' equality of opportunity<ref name=twsL23/>) and it is a core idea regarding the subject of [[distributive justice]] espoused by [[John Roemer]]<ref name=twsH74/><ref>Roemer, John, 1995, "Equality and Responsibility," Boston Review, April–May issue, pp. 3–7. </ref><ref>Roemer, John, 1998, Equality of Opportunity, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. </ref> and [[Ronald Dworkin]]<ref>Dworkin, Ronald, 2000, Sovereign Virtue, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, chapters 1–3. </ref><ref name=twsH21>{{cite news

Like the ''substantive'' notion, the ''level playing field'' conception goes farther than the usual ''formal'' approach. <ref name=twsH74/> The idea is that initial "unchosen inequalities" – prior circumstances over which an individual had no control but which impact his or her success in a given competition for a particular post – these unchosen inequalities should be eliminated as much as possible, according to this conception. According to Roemer, society should "do what it can to ''level the playing field'' so that all those with relevant potential will eventually be admissible to pools of candidates competing for positions. <ref name=twsH74/> Afterwards, when an individual competes for a specific post, he or she might make specific choices which cause future inequalities – and these inequalities are deemed acceptable because of the previous presumption of fairness. <ref name=twsH77f>{{cite news

==Practical considerations==. 
===Difficulties with implementation===. 
There is general agreement that programs to bring about certain types of equality of opportunity can be difficult, and that efforts to cause one result often have unintended consequences or cause other problems. There is agreement that the ''formal'' approach is easier to implement than the others, although there are difficulties there too.  . 

A government policy that requires equal treatment can pose problems for lawmakers. A requirement for government to provide equal health care services for all citizens can be prohibitively expensive. If government seeks equality of opportunity for citizens to get health care by rationing services using a maximization model to try to save money, new difficulties might emerge. For example, trying to ration health care by maximizing the "quality-adjusted years of life" might steer monies away from disabled persons even though they may be more deserving, according to one analysis. <ref name=twsH11/><ref>Brock, Dan W., 2000, "Health Care Resource Prioritization and Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities," in Leslie Pickering Francis and Anita Silvers, eds., Americans with Disabilities: Exploring Implications of the Law for Individuals and Institutions, New York and London: Routledge, pp. 223–235. </ref> In another instance, ''BBC News'' questioned whether it was wise to ask female army recruits to undergo the same strenuous tests as their male counterparts, since many women were being injured as a result. <ref name=twsH36>{{cite news

Age discimination can present vexing challenges for policymakers trying to implement equal opportunity. <ref name=twsH11/><ref>Daniels, Norman, 1985, Just Health Care, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press</ref><ref>McKerlie, Dennis, 1989, "Equality and Time," Ethics 99, pp. 475–491</ref> According to several studies, attempts to be equally fair to both a young and an old person are problematic because the older person has presumably fewer years left to live, and it may make more sense for a society to invest greater resources in a younger person's health. <ref>McKerlie, Dennis, 1999, "Justice Between the Young and the Old," Philosophy and Public Affairs 30, pp. 152–177</ref><ref>Temkin, Larry S., 1993, Inequality, New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, chapter 8</ref> Treating both persons equally, while following the letter of the equality of opportunity, seems unfair from a different perspective.  . 

Another difficulty is that it is hard for a society to bring substantive equality of opportunity to every type of position or industry. If a nation focuses efforts on some industries or positions, then people with other talents may be left out. For example, in an example in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', a warrior society might provide equal opportunity for all kinds of people to achieve military success through fair competition, but people with non-military skills such as farming may be left out. <ref name=twsH11/> . 

Lawmakers have run into problems trying to implement equality of opportunity. In 2010 in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], a legal requirement "forcing public bodies to try to reduce inequalities caused by class disadvantage" was scrapped after much debate, and replaced by a hope that organizations would try to focus more on "fairness" than "equality"; fairness is generally seen as a much vaguer concept than equality,<ref name=twsH22>{{cite news

It is possible to reexamine the procedures governing a specific hiring decision, see if they were followed, and re-evaluate the selection by asking questions such as: was it fair? were fair procedures followed? was the best applicant selected? This is a judgment call and it is possible that biases may enter into the minds of decision-makers. The determination of ''equality of opportunity'' in such an instance is based on mathematical [[probability]]: if ''equality of opportunity'' is in effect, then it's seen as ''fair'' if each of two applicants has a 50% chance of winning the job, that is, they both have ''equal'' chances to succeed (assuming of course that the person making the probability assessment is unaware of all variables – including valid ones such as talent or skill as well as arbitrary ones such as race or gender.) But it is hard to measure whether each applicant had, in fact, a 50% chance, based on the outcome.  . 

* '''Groups.''' When assessing ''equal opportunity'' for a type of job or company or industry or nation, then [[statistical analysis]] is often done by looking at patterns and abnormalities,<ref name=twsH11/> typically comparing subgroups with larger groups on a percentage basis. If equality of opportunity is violated, perhaps by [[discrimination]] which affects a subgroup or population over time, it is possible to make this determination using statistical analysis, but there are numerous difficulties involved. <ref name=twsH11/> Nevertheless, entities such as city governments<ref name=twsP44a>{{cite news

''Equal opportunity'' has been described as a fundamental "basic notion" in business and commerce, and described by [[economist]] [[Adam Smith]] as a basic economic precept. <ref name=twsL19/> There has been research suggesting that "competitive markets will tend to drive out such discrimination" since employers or institutions which hire based on arbitrary criteria will be weaker as a result, and not perform as well as firms which embrace equality of opportunity. <ref name=twsH11/> Firms competing for overseas contracts have sometimes argued in the press for equal chances during the bidding process, such as when American oil corporations wanted equal shots at developing oil fields in [[Sumatra]];<ref name=twsH41>{{cite news

===History===. 
According to professor David Christian of MacQuarie University, an underlying "big history" trend has been a shift from seeing people as resources to exploit towards a perspective of seeing people as individuals to empower. According to Christian, in many ancient agrarian civilizations, roughly nine of every ten persons was a peasant exploited by a ruling class. In the past thousand years, there has been a gradual movement in the direction of greater respect for equal opportunity, as political structures based on generational hierarchies and [[feudalism]] broke down during the late [[Middle Ages]] and new structures emerged during the [[Renaissance]]. [[monarchy|Monarchies]] were replaced by [[democracy|democracies]]; kings were replaced by parliaments and congresses. [[Slavery]] was abolished generally. The new entity of the [[nation state]] emerged with highly specialized parts, including [[corporation]]s, laws, and new ideas about [[citizenship]], and values about [[individual rights]] found expression in constitutions, laws, and statutes.  . 

[[File:Thurgoodmarshall1967.jpg|thumb|right|[[African-American]] [[civil rights]] lawyer [[Thurgood Marshall]] fought numerous battles in the courts for equal opportunity for all races in the United States. He argued the 1954 [[Brown v. Board of Education]] case and won. In 1967 he was appointed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].]]
In the United States, one legal analyst suggested that the real beginning of the modern sense of ''equal opportunity'' was in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] which provided "equal protection under the law."<ref name=twsL11/> The amendment did not mention ''equal opportunity'' directly, but it helped undergird a series of later rulings which dealt with legal struggles, particularly by [[African American]]s and later women, seeking greater political and economic power in the growing republic. In 1933, a congressional "Unemployment Relief Act" forbade [[discrimination]] "on the basis of race, color, or creed". <ref name=twsL11/> The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court's]] 1954 [[Brown v Board of Education]] decision furthered government initiatives to end discrimination. <ref name=twsL11/> In 1961, [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] signed [[Executive Order 10925]] which enabled a presidential committee on equal opportunity,<ref name=twsL11/> which was soon followed by President [[Lyndon Johnson|Johnson]]'s [[Executive Order 11246]]. <ref name=twsL33>{{cite news

Conflict between ''formal'' and ''substantive'' approaches manifested itself in backlashes, sometimes described as [[reverse discrimination]], such as the [[Regents of the University of California v.

The practical effect of our actions, however, is that we are working to give our daughter an edge – that is, a better chance to succeed than everybody else's children. Even though we might be embarrassed to think of it this way, we are doing our utmost to undermine equal opportunity.

D'Souza argued that it was wrong for government to try to bring his daughter down, or to force him to raise up other people's children. <ref name=twsH63/>  But a counterargument is that there is a benefit to everybody, including D'Souza's daughter, to have a society with less anxiety about downward mobility, less class resentment, and less possible violence. <ref name=twsH63/> . 

An argument similar to D'Souza's was raised by Nozick in ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'', who wrote that the only way to achieve equality of opportunity was "directly worsening the situations of those more favored with opportunity, or by improving the situation of those less well-favored."<ref name=twsH77d>{{cite news

Nozick argued against equality of opportunity on the grounds that it violates the [[rights]] of property, since the equal opportunity maxim interferes with an owner's right to do what he or she pleases with a property. <ref name=twsH11/> Property rights were a major component of the philosophy of [[John Locke]], and are sometimes referred to as ''Lockean rights''. <ref name=twsH11/> The sense of the argument is along these lines: equal opportunity rules regarding, say, a hiring decision within a factory, made to bring about greater fairness, violate a factory owner's rights to run the factory as he or she sees best; it has been argued that a factory owner's right to property encompasses all decision-making within the factory as being part of those property rights. That some people's "natural assets" were unearned is irrelevant to the equation, according to Nozick, and he argued that people are nevertheless entitled to enjoy these assets and other things freely given by others. <ref name=twsL12/> . 

[[Friedrich Hayek]] felt that luck was too much of a variable in economics, such that one can not devise a system with any kind of fairness when many market outcomes are unintended. <ref name=twsL12/> By sheer chance or random circumstances, a person may become wealthy just by being in the right place and time, and Hayek argued that it is impossible to devise a system to make opportunities equal without knowing how such interactions may play out. <ref name=twsL12/> Hayek saw not only ''equality of opportunity'' but all of [[social justice]] as a "mirage". <ref name=twsL12/> . 

Some conceptions of equality of opportunity, particularly the substantive and ''level playing field'' variants, have been criticized on the basis that they make assumptions to the effect that people have similar genetic makeups. <ref name=twsH11/> Other critics have suggested that [[social justice]] is more complex than mere equality of opportunity. <ref name=twsH11/> Robert Nozick made the point that what happens in society can not always be reduced to competitions for a coveted position; in 1974, Nozick wrote that "life is not a race in which we all compete for a prize which someone has established" and that there is "no unified race" and there is not some one person "judging swiftness."<ref name=twsH77d33/> .
