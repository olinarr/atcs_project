'''Women's rights''' are [[entitlements]]  and [[Political freedom|freedoms]] claimed for women and girls of all ages in many societies.  . 

In some places these rights are institutionalized or supported by law, local custom, and behaviour, whereas in others they may be ignored or suppressed. They differ from broader notions of human rights through claims of an inherent historical and traditional bias against the exercise of rights by women and girls in favour of men and boys. <ref name=Hosken>Hosken, Fran P., 'Towards a Definition of Women's Rights' in ''Human Rights Quarterly'', Vol. 3, No. 2. (May, 1981), pp. 1–10. </ref> . 

Issues commonly associated with notions of women's rights include, though are not limited to, the right: to bodily integrity and autonomy; to [[Women's suffrage|vote]] (suffrage); to hold public office; to work; to fair wages or equal pay; to [[right to property|own property]]; [[Right to education|to education]]; to serve in the military or be conscripted; to enter into legal contracts; and to have marital, parental and religious rights. <ref name=quarterly>Lockwood, Bert B.

=== Greece === . 

The status of women in [[ancient Greece]] varied form city state to city state. Records exist of women in ancient [[Delphi]], [[Gortyn]], [[Thessaly]], [[Megara]] and [[Sparta]] owning land, the most prestigious form of [[private property]] at the time. <ref>{{Cite book| last = Gerhard| first = Ute| title = Debating women’s equality: toward a feminist theory of law from a European perspective| publisher = Rutgers University Press| year = 2001| page = 33| url = http://books.google.com/?id=XMohyLfGDDsC&dq=women+right+to+property| isbn = 978-0-8135-2905-9}}</ref> . 

In [[ancient Athens]], women had no legal personhood and were assumed to be part of the [[oikos]] headed by the male [[kyrios]]. Until marriage, women were under the guardianship of their father or other male relative, once married the husband became a woman’s kyrios. As women were barred from conducting legal proceedings, the kyrios would do so on their behalf. <ref name="google114">{{Cite book| last = Blundell| first =Sue| title = Women in ancient Greece, Volume 1995, Part 2| publisher = Harvard University Press| year = 1995| page = 114| url = http://books.google.com/?id=Xfx1VaSIOgQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=women+ancient+greece#v=onepage&q=women%20athens&f=false| isbn = 978-0-674-95473-1}}</ref> Athenian women had limited [[right to property]] and therefore were not considered full citizens, as citizenship and the entitlement to [[civil and political rights]] was defined in relation to property and the means to life. <ref>{{Cite book| last = Gerhard| first = Ute| title = Debating women’s equality: toward a feminist theory of law from a European perspective| publisher = Rutgers University Press| year = 2001| page = 35| url = http://books.google.com/?id=XMohyLfGDDsC&dq=women+right+to+property| isbn = 978-0-8135-2905-9}}</ref> However, women could acquire rights over property through gifts, dowry and inheritance, though her kyrios had the right to dispose of a woman’s property. <ref>{{Cite book| last = Blundell| first =Sue| title = Women in ancient Greece, Volume 1995, Part 2| publisher = Harvard University Press| year = 1995| page = 115| url = http://books.google.com/?id=Xfx1VaSIOgQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=women+ancient+greece#v=onepage&q=women%20athens&f=false| isbn = 978-0-674-95473-1}}</ref> Athenian women could enter into a contract worth less than the value of a “medimnos of barley” (a measure of grain), allowing women to engage in petty trading. <ref name="google114"/> Slaves, like women, were not eligible for full citizenship in ancient Athens, though in rare circumstances they could become citizens if freed. The only permanent barrier to citizenship, and hence full political and civil rights, in ancient Athens was gender.

By contrast, [[Sparta]]n women enjoyed a status, power, and respect that was unknown in the rest of the classical world. Although Spartan women were formally excluded from military and political life they enjoyed considerable status as mothers of Spartan warriors. As men engaged in military activity, women took responsibility for running estates. Following protracted warfare in the 4 century BC Spartan women owned approximately between 35%<ref name="Pomeroy"/> and 40% of all Spartan land and property. <ref>{{Cite book| last = Tierney| first = Helen| title = Women’s studies encyclopaedia, Volume 2| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| year = 1999| pages = 609–610| url = http://books.google.com/?id=2bDxJW3x4f8C&dq=spartan+women| isbn = 978-0-313-31072-0}}</ref> By the Hellenistic Period, some of the wealthiest Spartans were women. <ref>Pomeroy, Sarah B.

[[Plato]] acknowledged that extending civil and political rights to women would substantively alter the nature of the household and the state. <ref>{{Cite book| last = Robinson| first = Eric W.| title = Ancient Greek democracy: readings and sources| publisher = Wiley-Blackwell| year = 2004| page = 300| url = http://books.google.com/?id=Jug6crxEImIC&dq=Aristophanes+ecclesiazusae+women%27s+rights| isbn = 978-0-631-23394-7 }}</ref> [[Aristotle]], who had been taught by Plato, denied that women were slaves or subject to property, arguing that "nature has distinguished between the female and the slave", but he considered wives to be "bought". He argued that women's main economic activity is that of safeguarding the household property created by men. According to Aristotle the labour of women added no value because "the art of household management is not identical with the art of getting wealth, for the one uses the material which the other provides". <ref>{{Cite book| last = Gerhard| first = Ute| title = Debating women’s equality: toward a feminist theory of law from a European perspective| publisher = Rutgers University Press| year = 2001| pages = 32–35| url = http://books.google.com/?id=XMohyLfGDDsC&dq=women+right+to+property| isbn = 978-0-8135-2905-9}}</ref> .

=== Rome ===. 
<!-- {{Refimprove section|date=February 2011}}
'''Father Knows Best'''
Under [[Roman Law]] all legitimate children male or female fell under [[Patria Potestas]]. Patria Potestas was technically absolute, and early on included the right to kill children but during the Late Republic customs changed, and during the Empire legal rules changed in reflection. The unique thing about Patria Potestas was that it had no age limits, according to [[Gaius]] a man could be consul, have a wife and children of his own and future prominence but as long as his father was alive was still under his potestas (power) and so could own nothing. Patria Potestas only ended with either the death of the father, or emancipation by him. Early in the Republic [[Manus Marriage]] ended the potestas for women, but during the middle and later Republic that form of marriage became rare, eventually disappearing completely.  . 

'''Marriage Under Law'''
Rome had only two forms of marriage, and both had exactly the opposite view of legal effects. [[Manus Marriage]] was the earlier form of marriage and placed the woman under her husbands manus legally standing in the position of a daughter. Under this type of marriage women could own nothing, and had little if any legal protections. On the other hand a woman assumed the position of her husbands daughter in Manus Marriage making her agnatically instead of cognatically related to her children.  . 

Marriage Sine Manu was the second form of marriage that replaced Manus, and was the opposite of Manus. Women married Sine Manu experienced no legal changes, so if her father was alive at time of marriage she continued to be his dependent and before the reign of Marcus Aurelius he could even force an end to the marriage. The lack of any legal change of status for the women meant that (provided their father had either died or emancipated them) they could own property, conduct most forms of business, and divorce her husband (without any reason needed). Legally speaking the only lack of independence a woman in Rome experienced in a marriage without Manus was from her father. The only legal issue related to marriage was dowry. A dowry was not required by law, but was usually provided by a father or if a father was nonexistent it would be whatever the bride wished to come out of her own estate. It was administered by the husband, but in the event of a divorce he was required to provide either the dowry or the equivalent of it back to his wife. In the case of adultery husbands got to keep portions of the dowry.  . 

'''Politics'''
Legally speaking women were banned from politics. As with freedmen and slaves of the Imperial Family women of the imperial family gained some benefits from the fall of the Republic, but because the nature of the Principate was to hide dictatorship such power had to be subtle and kept out of the public eye when possible. The ban on women and politics was they could not vote or run for office (sine suffragio) enlist in the army, or represent somebody else in court, women speaking their minds was not considered politics and so some women like [[Hortensia]] managed to make appearances in politics without violating the law.  . 

'''Inheritance Rights'''
Everyone under the potestas of another had equal rights of inheritance under Roman Law, and wills that did otherwise ran risks of being challenged and invalidated as negligent.  --> . 

'''Stoic Influence'''
Stoic philosophies had a strong effect on the development of law in [[ancient Rome]]. The Roman stoic thinkers [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Musonius Rufus]] developed theories of just relationships (not to be confused with equality in society, or even equality) arguing that nature gives men and women equal capacity for virtue and equal obligations to act virtuously (a vague concept). Therefore they argued that men and women have an equal need for philosophical education. <ref name="Colish"/> Stoic theories entered Roman law first through the Roman lawyer and senator [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]] and the influence of [[stoicism]] and philosophy increased while the status of women improved under the Empire. <ref>{{Cite book| last = Ratnapala| first = Suri| title = Jurisprudence| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2009| pages =134–135 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=tNwdWlXxZt8C&dq=Stoic+law+women| isbn = 978-0-521-61483-2 }}</ref> .

The [[Qur'an]], revealed to [[Muhammad]] over the course of 23 years, provide guidance to the [[Islamic community]] and modified existing customs in Arab society. From 610 and 661, known as the [[early reforms under Islam]], the Qur'an introduced fundamental reforms to customary law and introduced rights for women in marriage, divorce and [[Islamic inheritance jurisprudence|inheritance]]. By providing that the wife, not her family, would receive a dowry from the husband, which she could administer as her personal property, the Qur'an made women a legal party to the marriage contract.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} .

=== The Middle Ages ===. 
According to [[English Common Law]], which developed from the 12th century onward, all property which a wife held at the time of a marriage became a possession of her husband. Eventually English courts forbade a husband's transferring property without the consent of his wife, but he still retained the right to manage it and to receive the money which it produced.

Starting in the late 18th century, and throughout the 19th century, rights, as a concept and claim, gained increasing political, social and philosophical importance in Europe. Movements emerged which demanded [[freedom of religion]], the abolition of [[slavery]], rights for women, rights for those who did not own property and [[universal suffrage]]. <ref>{{Cite book| last = Sweet| first = William| title = Philosophical theory and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights| publisher = University of Ottawa Press| year = 2003| page = 4| url = http://books.google.com/?id=_V_KuJGcJSAC&dq=%22natural+law%22+women+%22human+nature%22| isbn =978-0-7766-0558-6 }}</ref> In the late 18th century the question of women's rights became central to political debates in both France and Britain. At the time some of the greatest thinkers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], who defended democratic principles of [[Egalitarianism|equality]] and challenged notions that a privileged few should rule over the vast majority of the population, believed that these principles should be applied only to their own gender and their own race. The philosopher [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] for example thought that it was the order of nature for woman to obey men. He wrote "Women do wrong to complain of the inequality of man-made laws" and claimed that "when she tries to usurp our rights, she is our inferior". <ref>{{cite book| last = Lauren| first = Paul Gordon| title = The evolution of international human rights: visions seen| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2003| pages = 29 & 30| url = http://books.google.com/?id=gHRhWgbWyzMC&dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Man+and+of+the+Citizen| id = | isbn =978-0-8122-1854-1 }}</ref> . 

[[File:DDFC.jpg|150px|left|thumb|First page of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]]]
In 1791 the French playwright and political [[Activism|activist]] [[Olympe de Gouges]] published the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]'',<ref name=MS1112>Macdonald and Scherf, "Introduction", 11–12. </ref> modelled on the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] of 1789. The Declaration is ironic in formulation and exposes the failure of the [[French Revolution]], which had been devoted to [[Egalitarianism|equality]]. It states that: “This revolution will only take effect when all women become fully aware of their deplorable condition, and of the rights they have lost in society”. The Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen follows the seventeen articles of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] point for point and has been described by Camille Naish as “almost a parody... of the original document”. The first article of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen proclaims that “Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be based only on common utility.” The first article of Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen replied: “Woman is born free and remains equal to man in rights. Social distinctions may only be based on common utility”. De Gouges expands the sixth article of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which declared the rights of citizens to take part in the formation of law, to:

<blockquote>
“All citizens including women are equally admissible to all public dignities, offices and employments, according to their capacity, and with no other distinction than that of their virtues and talents”. 
</blockquote>
De Gouges also draws attention to the fact that under French law women were fully punishable, yet denied equal rights. <ref>{{cite book |title=Death comes to the maiden: Sex and Execution, 1431–1933 |last=Naish |first=Camille |year=1991 |publisher=Routledge |isbn= 978-0-415-05585-7 |page=137 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=OHYOAAAAQAAJ&dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Woman+and+the+Female+Citizen }}</ref> .

In his 1869 essay [[The Subjection of Women]] the English philosopher and political theorist [[John Stuart Mill]] described the situation for women in Britain as follows:
<blockquote>
"We are continually told that civilization and Christianity have restored to the woman her just rights. Meanwhile the wife is the actual bondservant of her husband; no less so, as far as the legal obligation goes, than slaves commonly so called."</blockquote> . 

Then a member of parliament, Mill argued that women should be given the [[right to vote]], though his proposal to replace the term 'man' with 'person' in the second [[Reform Bill of 1867]] was greeted with laughter in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and defeated by 76 to 196 votes. His arguments won little support amongst contemporaries<ref name="Brave new world – Women’s rights"/> but his attempt to amend the reform bill generated greater attention for the issue of women's suffrage in Britain. <ref name=suffrage/> Initially only one of several women’s rights campaign, suffrage became the primary cause of the British women’s movement at the beginning of the 20th century. <ref>{{cite book |title=The women’s suffrage movement in Britain, 1866–1928 |last=Van Wingerden |first=Sophia A. |year=1999 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn= 0-312-21853-2 |pages=1–2 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=0oLxK_NHI6kC&printsec=frontcover }}</ref> At the time the ability to vote was restricted to wealthy [[Property law|property owners]] within British jurisdictions.

During the 19th century some women began to agitate for the [[right to vote]] and participate in government and law making. <ref name=Krolokke>Krolokke, Charlotte and Anne Scott Sorensen, 'From Suffragettes to Grrls' in Gender Communication Theories and Analyses:From Silence to Performance (Sage, 2005)</ref> Other women opposed suffrage like Helen Kendrick Johnson, whose prescient 1897 work Woman and the Republic contains perhaps the best arguments against women's suffrage of the time. <ref>Johnson, Helen Kendrick.  Woman and the Republic. 1897. </ref>The ideals of [[women's suffrage]] developed alongside that of [[universal suffrage]] and today women's suffrage is considered a right (under the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]]).{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} During the 19th century the right to vote was gradually extended in many countries and women started to campaign for their right to vote. In 1893 New Zealand became the first country to give women the right to vote on a national level. Australia gave women the right to vote in 1902. <ref name=suffrage>{{cite web |title=Women's Suffrage |url=http://content.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=5193 |publisher=Scholastic |accessdate=20 July 2009}}</ref> A number of [[Nordic countries]] gave women the right to vote in the early 20th century – Finland (1906), Norway (1913), Denmark and Iceland (1915). With the end of the First World War many other countries followed – the Netherlands (1917), Austria, Canada, [[Czechoslovakia]], Georgia, Poland,and Sweden (1918), Germany and Luxembourg (1919), and the United States (1920) . Spain gave women the right to vote in 1931, France in 1944, Belgium, Italy, Romania and [[Yugoslavia]] in 1946. Switzerland gave women the right to vote in 1971, and Liechtenstein in 1984. <ref name=suffrage/> . 

In Latin America some countries gave women the right to vote in the first half of the 20th century – Ecuador (1929), Brazil (1932), El Salvador (1939), Dominican Republic (1942), Guatemala (1956) and Argentina (1946). In India, under colonial rule, universal suffrage was granted in 1935. Other Asian countries gave women the right to vote in the mid 20th century – Japan (1945), China (1947) and Indonesia (1955). In Africa women generally got the right to vote along with men through [[universal suffrage]] – Liberia (1947), Uganda (1958) and Nigeria (1960). In many countries in the Middle East [[universal suffrage]] was acquired after the Second World War, although in others, such as Kuwait, suffrage is very limited. <ref name=suffrage/> On 16 May 2005, the Parliament of Kuwait extended suffrage to women by a 35–23 vote. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/05/16/kuwait.women/index.html |title="Kuwait grants women right to vote" CNN.com (May 16, 2005) |publisher=CNN |date=16 May 2005 |accessdate=30 August 2011}}</ref> . 

== Property rights ==. 
During the 19th century some women in the United States and Britain began to challenge laws that denied them the [[Women's Property Rights|right to their property]] once they married. Under the common law doctrine of ''[[coverture]]'' husbands gained control of their wives' real estate and wages. Beginning in the 1840s, state legislatures in the United States<ref>{{cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/marriedwomensproperty/a/property_1848ny.htm |title=Married Women's Property Act &#124; 1848 &#124; New York State |publisher=Womenshistory.about.com |accessdate=30 August 2011}}</ref> and the British Parliament<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umd.umich.edu/casl/hum/eng/classes/434/geweb/PROPERTY.htm |title=Property Rights Of Women |publisher=Umd.umich.edu |accessdate=30 August 2011}}</ref> began passing statutes that protected women's property from their husbands and their husbands' creditors. These laws were known as the Married Women's Property Acts. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/366305/Married-Womens-Property-Acts |title=Married Women's Property Acts (United States [1839&#93;) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=30 August 2011}}</ref> Courts in the 19th-century United States also continued to require privy examinations of married women who sold their property.  A [[privy examination]] was a practice in which a married woman who wished to sell her property had to be separately examined by a judge or justice of the peace outside of the presence of her husband and asked if her husband was pressuring her into signing the document. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_womens_history/v012/12.2braukman.html |title=Project MUSE – Journal of Women's History – Married Women's Property and Male Coercion: United States Courts and the Privy Examination, 1864–1887 |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |accessdate=30 August 2011}}</ref> .

In the subsequent decades women's rights again became an important issue in the English speaking world. By the 1960s the movement was called "feminism" or "women's liberation." Reformers wanted the same pay as men, equal rights in law, and the freedom to plan their families or not have children at all. Their efforts were met with mixed results. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jofreeman.com/feminism/suffrage.htm |title=Waves of Feminism |publisher=Jofreeman.com |accessdate=30 August 2011}}</ref> . 

In the UK, a public groundswell of opinion in favour of legal equality had gained pace, partly through the extensive employment of women in what were traditional male roles during both world wars. By the 1960s the legislative process was being readied, tracing through MP [[Willie Hamilton]]'s [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]] report, his equal pay for equal work bill,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/620037.stm |work=BBC News | title=Tributes paid to veteran anti-royalist | date=27 January 2000}}</ref> the creation of a Sex Discrimination Board, [[Lady Sear]]'s draft sex anti-discrimination bill, a government [[Green Paper]] of 1973, until 1975 when the first British Sex Discrimination Act, an Equal Pay Act, and an [[Equal Opportunities Commission]] came into force. <ref>The Guardian, 29 December 1975</ref><ref>The Times, 29 December 1975 "Sex discrimination in advertising banned"</ref> With encouragement from the UK government, the other countries of the [[European Economic Community|EEC]] soon followed suit with an agreement to ensure that discrimination laws would be phased out across the European Community.  . 

In the USA, the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) was created in 1966 with the purpose of bringing about equality for all women. NOW was one important group that fought for the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA). This amendment stated that "equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of [[gender|sex]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.now.org/history/purpos66.html |title=The National Organization for Women's 1966 Statement of Purpose |publisher=Now.org |date=29 October 1966 |accessdate=30 August 2011}}</ref> But there was disagreement on how the proposed amendment would be understood. Supporters believed it would guarantee women equal treatment. But critics feared it might deny women the right be financially supported by their husbands. The amendment died in 1982 because not enough states had ratified it. ERAs have been included in subsequent Congresses, but have still failed to be ratified. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/national-organization-for-women?cat=biz-fin&nr=1 |title=National Organization for Women: Definition and Much More from |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=30 August 2011}}</ref> .

== Natural law and women's rights ==. 
17th century [[natural law]] philosophers in Britain and America, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[John Locke]], developed the theory of [[natural rights]] in reference to ancient philosophers such as [[Aristotle]] and the Christian theologise [[Aquinas]]. Like the ancient philosophers, 17th century natural law philosophers defended [[slavery]] and an inferior status of women in law. <ref name="Morey 2010 282">{{Cite book| last = Morey| first = Dr Robert A.| title = The Bible, Natural theology and Natural Law: Conflict Or Compromise?| publisher = Xulon Press| year = 2010| page = 282 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=Ct2P-AUUMe0C&dq=Dr+Robert+a.+Morey| isbn = 978-1-60957-143-6}}</ref> Relying on ancient Greek philosophers, natural law philosophers argued that [[natural rights]] where not derived from god, but were "universal, self-evident, and intuitive", a law that could be found in nature.

The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted in 1948, enshrines "the equal rights of men and women", and addressed both the equality and equity issues. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights}}</ref>
In 1979 the United Nations [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) for legal implementation of the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]]. Described as an international [[bill of rights]] for [[woman|women]], it came into force on 3 September 1981. The UN member states that have not ratified the convention are Iran, Nauru, Palau, Somalia, Sudan, Tonga, and the United States. [[Niue]] and the Vatican City, which are non-member states, have also not ratified it. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/protocol/CEDAW%20Ratification%20Table%20IV-8.en.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - IV-8.en.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=30 August 2011}}</ref> . 

The Convention defines discrimination against women in the following terms:
<blockquote>Any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field. </blockquote> . 

It also establishes an agenda of action for putting an end to sex-based discrimination for which states ratifying the Convention are required to enshrine [[gender equality]] into their domestic legislation, repeal all discriminatory provisions in their laws, and enact new provisions to guard against discrimination against women. They must also establish tribunals and public institutions to guarantee women effective protection against discrimination, and take steps to eliminate all forms of discrimination practiced against women by individuals, organizations, and enterprises. <ref>[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]], Article 2 (e)</ref>

{{main|Rape|War rape}}
Rape, sometimes called [[sexual assault]], is an assault by a person involving [[sexual intercourse]] with or [[sexual penetration]] of another person without that person's [[consent]]. Rape is generally considered a serious [[sex crime]] as well as a civil assault. When part of a widespread and systematic practice rape and [[sexual slavery]] are now recognised as [[crime against humanity]] and [[war crime]]. Rape is also now recognised as an element of the crime of [[genocide]] when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted group.  . 

=== Rape as an element of the crime of genocide ===. 
{{main|Rwandan genocide}}
In 1998, the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] established by the United Nations made landmark decisions that rape is a crime of [[genocide]] under [[international law]]. The trial of [[Jean-Paul Akayesu]], the mayor of Taba Commune in Rwanda, established precedents that rape is an element of the crime of genocide. The Akayesu judgement includes the first interpretation and application by an international court of the 1948 [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]]. The Trial Chamber held that rape, which it defined as "a physical invasion of a sexual nature committed on a person under circumstances which are coercive", and sexual assault constitute acts of genocide insofar as they were committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted group, as such. It found that sexual assault formed an integral part of the process of destroying the [[Tutsi]] ethnic group and that the rape was systematic and had been perpetrated against Tutsi women only, manifesting the specific intent required for those acts to constitute genocide. <ref name=unreport>Fourth Annual Report of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] to the General Assembly (September, 1999), accessed at [http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/annualreports/a54/9925571e.htm]. </ref> . 

Judge [[Navanethem Pillay]] said in a statement after the verdict: “From time immemorial, rape has been regarded as [[spoils of war]]. Now it will be considered a war crime. We want to send out a strong message that rape is no longer a trophy of war.”<ref name=paulwalters>[[Navanethem Pillay]] is quoted by Professor Paul Walters in his presentation of her honorary [[doctorate of law]], [[Rhodes University]], April 2005 [http://www.ru.ac.za/academic/graduation/addresses_and_citations/2005/Judge_Pillay_citation.doc]</ref> An estimated 500,000 women were raped during the 1994 Rwandan Genocide. <ref>[http://www.amnesty.org.nz/web/pages/home.nsf/0/e57ea3f05f6aa848cc256e460012f365?OpenDocument Violence Against Women: Worldwide Statistics]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref> . 

=== Rape and sexual enslavement as crime against humanity ===. 
{{main|Crimes against humanity}}
The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]] Explanatory Memorandum, which defines the jurisdiction of the [[International Criminal Court]], recognises rape, [[sexual slavery]], [[enforced prostitution]], forced pregnancy, [[compulsory sterilization|enforced sterilization]], "or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity" as [[Crimes against humanity|crime against humanity]] if the action is part of a widespread or systematic practice. <ref name="Horton">As quoted by Guy Horton in ''[http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs3/Horton-2005.pdf Dying Alive – A Legal Assessment of Human Rights Violations in Burma]'' April 2005, co-Funded by The Netherlands Ministry for Development Co-Operation. See section "12.52 Crimes against humanity", Page 201. He references RSICC/C, Vol. 1 p. 360</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm |title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=30 August 2011}}</ref> The [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] also condemn systematic rape as well as murder, [[sexual slavery]], and forced pregnancy, as the "violations of the fundamental principles of international human rights and humanitarian law." and require a particularly effective response. <ref>Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, Section II, paragraph 38</ref> . 

Rape was first recognised as [[crime against humanity]] when the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] issued arrest warrants based on the [[Geneva Conventions]] and Violations of the Laws or Customs of War. Specifically, it was recognised that Muslim women in [[Foča Region|Foca]] (southeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina) were subjected to systematic and widespread [[gang rape]], torture and [[sexual enslavement]] by [[Bosnian Serb]] soldiers, policemen, and members of paramilitary groups after the takeover of the city in April 1992. <ref name=autogenerated17>[http://www.haverford.edu/relg/sells/rape.html Rape as a Crime Against Humanity]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref> The indictment was of major legal significance and was the first time that sexual assaults were investigated for the purpose of prosecution under the rubric of [[torture]] and [[enslavement]] as a crime against humanity. <ref name=autogenerated17 /> The indictment was confirmed by a 2001 verdict by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] that rape and [[sexual enslavement]] are [[crimes against humanity]]. This ruling challenged the widespread acceptance of rape and sexual enslavement of women as intrinsic part of war. <ref name=AmnestyInt2001feb22>[http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR630042001?open&of=ENG-BIH Bosnia and Herzegovina : Foca verdict – rape and sexual enslavement are crimes against humanity]. 22 February 2001. [[Amnesty International]]. </ref> The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] found three Bosnian Serb men guilty of rape of [[Bosniac]] (Bosnian Muslim) women and girls (some as young as 12 and 15 years of age), in [[Foča Region|Foca]], eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina. Furthermore two of the men were found guilty of the crime against humanity of [[sexual enslavement]] for holding women and girls captive in a number of de facto detention centres. Many of the women subsequently disappeared. <ref name=AmnestyInt2001feb22/> .
