In the [[United States]], [[employment discrimination]] is prohibited by a collection of state and federal [[law]]s, as well as by ordinances of counties and municipalities.  Only discrimination based on certain characteristics (protected categories) is illegal.  . 

The [[United States Constitution]] prohibits discrimination by federal and state governments.  Discrimination in the [[private sector]] is not directly constrained by the Constitution, but has become subject to a growing body of federal and state law.  Federal law prohibits discrimination in a number of departments, including recruiting, hiring, job evaluations, promotion policies, training, compensation and disciplinary action.  State laws often extend protection to additional categories or employers.  . 

Under Federal law, employers generally cannot discriminate against employees on the basis of:

==Constitutional basis==. 
{{Ref improve section|date=June 2009}}
The [[United States Constitution]] does not directly address employment discrimination, but its prohibitions on discrimination by the federal government have been held to protect federal government employees.  . 

The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] limit the power of the federal and state governments to discriminate. The Fifth amendment has an explicit requirement that the federal government not deprive individuals of "life, liberty, or property", without due process of the law. It also contains an implicit guarantee that the Fourteenth Amendment explicitly prohibits states from violating an individual's rights of [[due process]] and [[equal protection]]. In the employment context, these Constitutional provisions would limit the right of the state and federal governments to discriminate in their employment practices by treating employees, former employees, or job applicants unequally because of membership in a group (such as a race or sex). Due process protection requires that government employees have a fair procedural process before they are terminated if the termination is related to a "liberty" (such as the right to [[free speech]]) or property interest. As both Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses are passive, the clause that empowers Congress to pass anti-discrimination bills (so they are not unconstitutional under Tenth Amendment) is [[Congressional power of enforcement|Section 5 of Fourteenth Amendment]].  . 

Employment discrimination or harassment in the private sector is not unconstitutional, because Federal and most State Constitutions do not expressly give their respective government the power to enact civil rights laws that apply to the private sector.  The Federal government's authority to regulate a private business, including civil rights laws, stems from their power to regulate all commerce between the States.  Some State Constitutions do expressly afford some protection from public and private employment discrimination, such as Article I of the [[California Constitution]].  However, most State Constitutions only address discriminatory treatment by the government, including a public employer.   . 

Absent of a provision in a State Constitution, State civil rights laws that regulate the private sector are generally Constitutional under the "[[police powers]]" doctrine or the power of a State to enact laws designed to protect public health, safety and morals.   All States must adhere to the Federal Civil Rights laws, but States may enact civil rights laws that offer additional employment protection.  . 

For example, some State civil rights laws offer protection from employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or political affiliation, even through such forms of discrimination are not yet covered in federal civil rights laws.  . 

==Federal laws==. 
Federal law governing employment discrimination has developed over time.  . 

The [[Equal Pay Act of 1963|Equal Pay Act]] amended the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] in 1963. The Equal Pay Act prohibits employers and unions from paying different wages based on sex. It does not prohibit other discriminatory practices in hiring. It provides that where workers perform equal work in jobs requiring "equal skill, effort, and responsibility and performed under similar working conditions," they should be provided equal pay. <ref name="Equal Pay Act">[http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/epa.html The Equal Pay Act of 1963]</ref> The Fair Labor Standards Act applies to employers engaged in some aspect of [[interstate commerce]], or all of an employer's workers if the enterprise is engaged as a whole in a significant amount of interstate commerce.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} . 

[[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VII|Title VII]] of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] prohibits discrimination in many more aspects of the employment relationship. It applies to most employers engaged in interstate commerce with more than 15 employees, labor organizations, and employment agencies. Title VII prohibits discrimination based on race, color, [[religion]], [[sex]] or national origin. It makes it illegal for employers to discriminate based upon protected characteristics regarding terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.  Employment agencies may not discriminate when hiring or referring applicants, and [[labor organizations]] are also prohibited from basing membership or union classifications on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. <ref name="Title VII">[http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/vii.html Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]</ref>  The [[Pregnancy Discrimination Act]] amended [[Title VII]] in 1978, specifying that unlawful sex discrimination includes discrimination based on [[pregnancy]], [[childbirth]], and related medical conditions. <ref name="Pregnancy Discrimination Act">[http://www.eeoc.gov/abouteeoc/35th/thelaw/pregnancy_discrimination-1978.html Pregnancy Discrimination Act]</ref>
A related statute, the [[Family and Medical Leave Act]], sets requirements governing leave for [[pregnancy]] and
pregnancy-related conditions. <ref name="FMLA">[http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/fmla/ Family and Medical Leave Act]</ref> . 

The [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act]] (ADEA), enacted in 1968 and amended in 1978 and 1986, prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of age. The prohibited practices are nearly identical to those outlined in Title VII, except that the ADEA protects workers in firms with 20 or more workers rather than 15 or more. An employee is protected from discrimination based on age if he or she is over 40.  Since 1978, the ADEA has phased out and prohibited mandatory retirement, except for high-powered decision-making positions (that also provide large pensions). The ADEA contains explicit guidelines for benefit, pension and retirement plans. <ref name="ADEA">[http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/adea.html The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967]</ref> . 

The [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]] prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of disability by the federal government, federal contractors with contracts of more than $10,000, and programs receiving federal financial assistance. <ref name="Disability laws">[http://www.ada.gov/cguide.htm#anchor65610 A Guide to Disability Rights Laws]</ref>  It requires [[affirmative action]] as well as non-discrimination. <ref name="Disability laws"/>  [[Section 504]] requires reasonable accommodation, and [[Section 508]] requires that electronic and information technology be accessible to disabled employees. <ref name="Disability laws"/> . 

The [[Black Lung Benefits Act of 1973]] prohibits discrimination by mine operators against miners who suffer from "black lung disease" ([[pneumoconiosis]]). <ref name="USC Black Lung">[http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t29t32+1359+39++%28black%20l 30 USC Sec. 938]</ref> . 

The [[Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978]] prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of bankruptcy or bad debts. <ref name="Bankruptcy Act"/> . 

The [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]] prohibits employers with more than three employees from discriminating against anyone (except an unauthorized immigrant) on the basis of national origin or citizenship status. <ref name="THOMAS IRCA">[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d099:SN01200:@@@L&summ2=m&|TOM:/bss/d099query.html Summary of Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]</ref> . 

The [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA) was enacted to eliminate discriminatory barriers against qualified individuals with disabilities, individuals with a record of a disability, or individuals who are regarded as having a disability. It prohibits discrimination based on a physical or mental [[disability|handicap]]  and requires employers to make reasonable accommodations for disabled workers. The type of discrimination prohibited is broader than that explicitly outlined by Title VII.  The ADA also places an affirmative requirement on employers to reasonably accommodate a disabled employee in the performance of his or her job unless the employer can show that "undue hardship" will result. A qualified individual with a disability is a person who is "substantially limited" in one or more major life activities. <ref name="ADA">[http://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.htm AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990, AS AMENDED]</ref> . 

The Nineteenth Century Civil Rights Acts, amended in 1993, ensure all persons equal rights under the law and outline the damages available to complainants in actions brought under Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]], and the [[1973 Rehabilitation Act]]. <ref name="42 USC 1982">[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode42/usc_sec_42_00001981----000-.html § 1981. Equal rights under the law]</ref><ref name="42 USC 1981a">[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode42/usc_sec_42_00001981---a000-.html § 1981a. Damages in cases of intentional discrimination in employment]</ref> . 

The [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]] of 2008 bars employers from using individuals' genetic information when making hiring, firing, job placement, or promotion decisions. <ref name="GINA"/> . 

The proposed [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act]] would ban discrimination on the basis of [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]]. <ref name="NGLTF ENDA">[http://www.thetaskforce.org/issues/nondiscrimination/ENDA_main_page Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA)]</ref> . 

==State law==. 
State statutes also provide extensive protection from employment discrimination. Some laws extend similar protection as provided by the federal acts to employers who are not covered by those statutes.  Other statutes provide protection to groups not covered by the federal acts.  Some state laws provide greater protection to employees of the state or of state contractors.  . 

The following table lists protected categories not included in federal law.  Age is included as well, since federal law only covers workers over 40.  .

==Government employees==. 
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}} . 

Employees of federal and state governments have additional protections against employment discrimination.  . 

The [[Civil Service Reform Act of 1978]] prohibits discrimination in federal employment on the basis of conduct that does not affect job performance.  The [[Office of Personnel Management]] has interpreted this as prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. <ref name="OPM Sexual Orientation">[http://www.opm.gov/er/address2/Guide04.asp Addressing Sexual Orientation Discrimination In Federal Civilian Employment: A Guide to Employee's Rights]</ref>  In June 2009, it was announced that the interpretation would be expanded to include gender identity. <ref name="NYT federal transgender">[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/us/24transgender.html New Protections for Transgender Federal Workers]</ref> . 

==Exceptions==. 
{{Ref improve section|date=July 2009}} . 

===Bona fide occupational qualifications===. 
{{Main|Bona fide occupational qualifications}} . 

Employers are generally allowed to consider characteristics that would otherwise be discriminatory if they are bona fide occupational qualifications (BFOQ).  For example, a manufacturer of men's clothing may lawfully advertise for male models.  . 

{{Expand section|date=July 2009}} . 

===Religious organizations===. 
Some anti-discrimination laws make exceptions for religious organizations.  Religious organizations may be exempted entirely for certain categories, or may be allowed exceptions for certain types of positions.  . 

{{Expand section|date=July 2009}} . 

===Military===. 
The [[United States Army]] excludes women from specialties, positions, and units (battalion size or smaller) that routinely engage in direct combat. <ref name="Rand report">[http://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/2007/RAND_MG590-1.pdf Assessing the Assignment Policy for Army Women]</ref> . 

{{Expand section|date=August 2009}} . 

==Unintentional discrimination==. 
{{Main|Adverse impact}} . 

Employment practices that do not directly discriminate against a protected category may still be illegal if they produce a disparate impact on members of a protected group.  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment practices that have a discriminatory impact, unless they are related to job performance.  . 

<blockquote>The Act requires the elimination of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to employment that operate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of race, and, if, as here, an employment practice that operates to exclude Negroes cannot be shown to be related to job performance, it is prohibited, notwithstanding the employer's lack of discriminatory intent. <ref name="Griggs">[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=401&invol=424 GRIGGS v. DUKE POWER CO., 401 U.S. 424 (1971)]</ref></blockquote> . 

Height and weight requirements have been identified by the EEOC as having a disparate impact on national origin minorities. <ref name="EEOC Shaping">[http://www.eeoc.gov/abouteeoc/35th/1965-71/shaping.html Shaping Employment Discrimination Law]</ref> .
