'''Reservation in India''' is a form of [[affirmative action]] designed to improve the well being of perceived backward and under represented communities  in [[India]]. These are laws wherein a certain percentage of total available slots in educational institutes and government jobs are set aside for people from backward communities. Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST) and Other Backward Classes (OBC) are the primary beneficiaries of the reservation policies, while there are also reservation policies for women.  . 

The reservation system has been a matter of contention ever since the [[British Raj|British occupied India]] and remains a point of conflict. Many citizens who come from the upper classes find this policy of the government biased and oppose it, since they feel it takes away their rights to equality. But not everyone who comes from the underprivileged communities support the system because they say it makes them feel disadvantaged. Thus the reservation system is controversial.  . 

==Background of caste based reservation==. 
A common form of discrimination in India is the practice of [[untouchability]]. Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) are  the primary targets of this medieval practice, a practice, which is outlawed by the [[Constitution of India]]. <ref name="ddbasuart17">{{cite book|last=Basu|first=Durga Das|title=Introduction to the Constitution of India|year=2008|publisher=LexisNexis Butterworths Wadhwa|location=Nagpur|isbn=9788180385599|pages=98}}</ref><ref name="UFE">{{cite web|title= Untouchability in the Far East|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2382914|accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> An untouchable person is considered, "impure, less than human."<ref name="NG">{{cite web|title=India's "Untouchables" Face Violence, Discrimination |publisher=National Geographic|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/06/0602_030602_untouchables.html|accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> STs are generally those who have been living in tribal areas, away from modern civilization and development. <ref name="UGC">{{cite web|title=Financial Support|url=http://www.ugc.ac.in/financialsupport/special_cell.html|publisher=University Grants Commission, India|accessdate=20 October 2011}}</ref> While the definition of SCs and STs are primarily based on the history of oppression of the community, the definition of OBCs is more flexible and dynamic, and they are defined based upon the prevailing social status of their communities. <ref name="ddbasuart17" /> . 

The main objective of the Indian reservation system is to increase the social and educational status of the underprivileged communities, enabling them to take their rightful place in Indian society. <ref name= "RPR">{{cite web|title= Reservations Policy Revisited|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4377730=04 November 2011}}</ref> The reservation system exists to provide opportunities for the members of the SCs and STs so as to increase their [[Representation (politics)|representation]] in the [[legislature of India|legislature]], the executive of the nation and states, the [[labor force]], schools, colleges, and other social institutions. <ref name=UGC />  . 

The [[Constitution of India]] states in article 15(4): "All citizens shall have equal opportunities of receiving education. Nothing herein contained shall preclude the State from providing special facilities for educationally backward sections of the population.” It also states that “The State shall promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of society (in particular, of the scheduled castes and aboriginal tribes), and shall protect them from [[social injustice]] and all forms of [[exploitation]]." The article further states that nothing in the Article 15(4) will prevent the nation from helping SCs and STs for their betterment. <ref name="ILI Law Review" />  . 

In 1982, the Constitution specified 15% and 7.5% of vacancies in  [[public sector]] and government-aided educational institutes, are a quota reserved for the SC and ST candidates respectively for a period of five years, after which the quota system would be reviewed. <ref>{{cite web|title=Education Safeguards|url=http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/g/S/I6/0SI60301.htm|work=Department of Education|publisher=Government of India|accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref> This period was routinely extended by the succeeding governments. The [[Supreme Court of India]] ruled that reservations cannot exceed 50% (which it judged would violate equal access guaranteed by the Constitution) and put a cap on reservations. <ref name=mandaljudgement>{{cite book|title=Indra Sawhney And Ors. vs Union Of India (UOI) And Ors. on 8 August 1991|year=1991|publisher=Supreme Court of India|location=New Delhi}}</ref>  However, there are state laws that exceed this 50% limit and these are under litigation in the Supreme Court. For example, the caste-based reservation fraction stands at 69% and is applicable to about 87% of the population in the state of [[Tamil Nadu]]. In 1990, Prime Minister V.P. Singh announced that 27% of government positions would be set aside for OBC's in addition to the 22% already set aside for the SCs and STs. <ref name="The Struggle for Equality:Caste in Indian Politics" /> . 

==Beneficiary Groups of the Reservation System==. 
Enrolment in educational institutions and job placements are reserved based on a variety of criteria. The [[Quota Borda system|quota system]] sets aside a proportion of all possible positions for members of a specific group. Those not belonging to the designated communities can compete only for the remaining positions, while members of the designated communities can compete for all positions (reserved and open). For example, when 1 out of 10 clerical positions in railways are reserved for ex-servicemen, those who have served in the Army can compete both in the General Category as well as in the specific quota.  . 

Seats are reserved for people under the following criteria:- . 

===Caste=== . 

In central government funded [[higher education]] institutions, 22.5%<ref name="AAPE">{{cite web|title=Affirmative Action and Peer Effects: Evidence from Caste Based Reservation in General Education Colleges in India|url=people.virginia.edu/~ss5mj/Peereffects_April12_2011.pdf|publisher=Virginia University,Virginia|accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref> of available seats are reserved for Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) students (15% for SCs, 7.5% for STs). <ref name="AAPE"/> This reservation percentage has been raised to 49.5%,<ref name="AAPE"/> by including an additional 27% reservation for OBCs. This ratio is followed even in Parliament and all elections where a few constituencies are earmarked for those from certain communities (which keeps rotating as per the [[Delimitation Commission of India|Delimitation Commission]]).  . 

The exact percentages differ from state to state:
**In [[Tamil Nadu]], the percentage of reservation is 18%<ref name="AAPE"/> for SCs and 1% for STs, being based on local demographics. 
**In [[Andhra Pradesh]], 25% of educational institutes and government jobs for OBCs, 35% for SCs, 6% for STs and 4% for [[Muslims]]. <ref>{{cite book|last=Arora|first=N.D|title=Political Science for Civil Services Main Examination|year=2010|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|pages=19|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=z8Flb0gZ3ZkC&pg=SA5-PA19&lpg=SA5-PA19&dq=In+%5B%5BAndhra+Pradesh%5D%5D,+25%25+of+educational+institutes+and+government+jobs+for+OBCs,+15%25+for+SCs,+6%25+for+STs+and+4%25+for+%5B%5BMuslims%5D%5D.&source=bl&ots=NLg2rFL0be&sig=LxstpjYI-v6a_FOlN9iy_I0ffYk&hl=en&ei=T8zSTr3sNKieiALP-qSADA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=In%20%5B%5BAndhra%20Pradesh%5D%5D%2C%2025%25%20of%20educational%20institutes%20and%20government%20jobs%20for%20OBCs%2C%2015%25%20for%20SCs%2C%206%25%20for%20STs%20and%204%25%20for%20%5B%5BMuslims%5D%5D.&f=false}}</ref>
**In [[West Bengal]], 35% of educational institutes and 45% of government jobs for SC,ST, and OBC.(25% SC, 12% ST, and 10% Muslim).  . 

===Gender=== . 

Women get 50%<ref name= "IQWIE">The Implementation of Quotas for Women: The Indian Experience. {{cite web|title=TheImplementationofQuotasforWomen:TheIndianExperience|url=http://www.quotaproject.org/CS/CS_India.pdf|publisher=CentreforWomen'sDevelopmentStudies,India|accessdate 05 November 2011}}</ref> reservation in ''[[gram panchayat]]'' (village assembly - a form of local village government) and [[municipal elections]]. There is a long-term plan to extend this reservation to [[Parliament of India|parliament]] and [[legislative assemblies]]. For instance, some law schools in India have a 30% reservation for females. Progressive political opinion in India is strongly in favor of providing preferential treatment to women in order to create a level playing field for all of its citizens.  . 

The Women's Reservation Bill was passed by the [[Rajya Sabha]] on 9 March 2010 by a majority vote of 186 members in favor and 1 against. It will now be forwarded to the Lok Sabha, and if passed there, would be implemented.  . 

===Religion=== . 

The [[Tamil Nadu]] government has allotted 3.5% of seats each to Muslims and Christians, thereby altering the OBC reservation to 23% from 30% (since it excludes persons belonging to Other Backward Castes who are either Muslims or Christians). <ref name=Viswanathan>{{Cite news| last = Viswanathan | first = S. | author-link = | title =  A step forward | newspaper = Frontline | volume=24 | issue= 22 | pages = | date = 2007-11-16 | url = http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fline/fl2422/stories/20071116502203400.htm}}. </ref> . 

[[Andhra Pradesh]]'s administration has introduced a law enabling 4% reservations for Muslims. (contested in court) [[Kerala Public Service Commission]] has a quota of 12% for Muslims. Religious minority status educational institutes also have 50% reservation for their particular religions. The Central government has listed a number of [[Muslim]] communities as [[List of Muslim Other Backward Classes communities|backward Muslims]], making them eligible for reservation.  . 

===State of Domiciles=== . 

With few exceptions, all jobs under state government are reserved to those who are [[Domicile (law)|domiciles]] under that government. In Punjab Engineering College, Chandigarh, earlier 85% of seats were reserved for Chandigarh domiciles and now it is 50%. 
There are also some seat reserved for Jammu and Kashmir migrants in every Government aided educational institute.  . 

===Other=== . 

Some reservations are also made for: . 

* Terrorist victims from Kashmir in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]
* Single Girl Child in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]
* Sons/daughters/grandsons/granddaughters of [[Resistance movement|Freedom Fighters]]
* [[Disability|Physically handicapped]]
* Sports personalities
* [[Non-resident Indian and Person of Indian Origin|Non-Resident Indians]] (NRIs) have a small fraction of reserved seats in educational institutions. (Note : NRI reservations were removed from IIT in 2003)
* [[Candidates]] sponsored by various organizations
* Those who have served in the [[Indian Armed Forces|armed forces]] (ex-serviceman quota)
* Dependents of [[Indian Armed Forces|armed forces]] personnel killed in action
* Repatriates
* Reservation in [[special schools]] of Government Undertakings /PSUs meant for the children of their employees (e.g. Army schools, PSU schools, etc.)
* Paid pathway reservations in places of worship (e.g., Tirupathi Balaji]Temple, Tiruthani Murugan (Balaji) temple)
* Seat reservation for [[Senior citizen]]s/ PH in public bus transport . 

==Government funding allowing reservations in colleges/universities==. 
There is a [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]] (UGC) set up that provides financial assistance to universities for the establishment of Special Cells for SC/STs. Their purpose is to help universities [[Implementation|implement]] the reservation policy in the student admissions and staff recruitment processes at teaching and non teaching levels. They also help the SC/ST categories integrate with the university community and remove the difficulties which they may have experienced. SC/ST cells like these have been set up in 109 universities. 
The UCG provides financial assistance to universities and [[affiliated colleges]] for implementation of the Special Cells. It provides the universities with assistance worth "Rs.1, 00,000/- per annum for:  
:# Travelling Allowances & Dearness Allowances for [[field work]]
:# Data Collection
:# Analysis and [[evaluation]] of [[statistical data]]
:# New Computer and Printer (once in a plan period)"
The UGC provides financial assistance only up to the end of the Xth Plan period ending on March 31st, 2007. The work undertaken by the SC/ST Cells is reviewed at the end of Xth plan. The Xth plan is proposed to ensure that there is an effective implementation of the reservation policy in [[University and college admissions|admissions]], [[recruitment]], allotment of staff quarters, [[hostel]]s, etc. Essentially, its goal is to to ensure that the SC/ST Cells are established in the universities. <ref name=UGC /> .

If the husband holds one of the above jobs and the wife doesn't then the husband's income will be taken into consideration and if the wife holds one of the above jobs then the wife's income will be taken into consideration.The income of the family as a whole will be taken into account because the whole point of the reservation system is to raise the social status of the people that belong to the SC's, ST's and OBC's and if a family's income is high already it is considered that it raises their social status as well. <ref name="National Commission for Backward Classes" />

==History of the Reservations System==. 
The social reservation in Indian continent is an age-old traditional system sometimes mentioned as equivalent to apartheid.Every person's occupation or job status was fixed by birth.Not only that even who will get education or not , who will live where , who will be allowed to avail social amenities or not was also determined by birth.The British understood their psyche very well and gave it a legal and constitutional acknowledgement.  . 

Present  Reservation system has a long history and has been debated before and after Indian Independence [[British Raj|from the British]] in 1947.  . 

Reservations in favor of Backward Classes (BCs) were introduced long before independence in a large area, comprising the Presidency areas and the [[Princely states]] south of the Vindhyas. In 1882, [[William Wilson Hunter|Hunter Commission]] was appointed. [[Mahatma Jyotirao Phule]] made a demand of free and compulsory education for everyone along with proportionate reservation in government jobs. <ref name="ILI Law Review">{{cite web|last=Laskar|first=Mehbubul Hassan|title=Rethinking Reservation in Higher Education in India|url=http://www.ili.ac.in/pdf/article_2.pdf|publisher=ILI Law Review}}</ref> In 1891, there was a demand for reservation of government jobs with an agitation (in the princely State of Travancore) against the recruitment of ''non-natives'' into public service overlooking qualified ''native'' people. <ref name="ILI Law Review" />  In 1901,reservations were introduced in Maharashtra (in the Princely State of Kolhapur) by [[Shahu Maharaj]]. <ref name="ILI Law Review" />  [[Shahu IV|Chatrapati Sahuji Maharaj]], Maharaja of Kolhapur in [[Maharashtra]] introduced reservation in favour of non-Brahmin and backward classes as early as 1902. He provided free education to everyone and opened several hostels in Kolhapur to make it easier for everyone to receive the education. He also made sure everyone got suitable employment no matter what social class they belonged. He also appealed for a class-free India and the abolition of untouchability. The notification of 1902 created 50% reservation in services for backward classes/communities in the State of [[Kolhapur]]. This is the first official instance (Government Order) providing for reservation for depressed classes in India. <ref name="BSP">Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj.{{cite web|title=Shri Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj|url=http://bspindia.org/rajshri-shahuji-maharaj.php|work=History|publisher=Bahujan Samaj Party|accessdate=20 October 2011}}</ref>  . 

In 1908, reservations were introduced in favour of a number of castes and communities that had little share in the administration by the British. <ref name="ILI Law Review" /> There were many other reforms in favor of and against reservations before the Indian Independence itself.  . 

Even after the Indian Independence there were some major changes in favor of the STs, SCs and OBCs.  One of the most important occurred  in 1979 when the [[Mandal Commission]] was established to assess the situation of the socially and educationally backward classes. <ref name="Bhattacharya">Bhattacharya, Amit. {{Cite web|url=http://www.theotherindia.org/caste/who-are-the-obcs.html|title=Who are the OBCs?|accessdate=2006-04-19 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060627065912/http://www.theotherindia.org/caste/who-are-the-obcs.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 27 June 2006}} ''Times of India'', 8 April 2006. </ref> The commission did not have exact figures for a sub-caste, known as the [[Other Backward Class]](OBC), and used the 1930<ref name=Ramaiah>{{Cite web

But it wasn't until the 1990s that the recommendations of the Mandala Commission were implemented in Government Jobs by [[Vishwanath Pratap Singh]]. <ref>{{cite web|title=Implementation of Recommendations of Mandal Commission|url=http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/lsdeb/ls10/ses4/0507089201.htm|publisher=Parliament of India|accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> Many states wanted to change their reservation policies, and in 2010 the Supreme Court  held that if the state wants to frame rules regarding reservation in promotions and consequential seniority, it has to provide quantifiable data that is there is backwardness, inadequacy of representation in public employment and overall administrative inefficiency. Unless such an exercise is undertaken by the state government, the rules in promotions and consequential seniority cannot be introduced.  . 

The concept of [[untouchability]] was not practiced uniformly throughout the country; therefore the identification of [[Depressed classes|oppressed classes]] was difficult to carry out. Allegedly, the practice of segregation and untouchability prevailed more in the southern parts of India as opposed to in Northern India. Furthermore, certain castes/ communities, considered "untouchable" in one province were not in other provinces. <ref>{{cite web|title=The Untouchables of India|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/ahkitj/wscfap/arms1974/Book%20Series/TheImageOfGodIM/IOGIM-untouchables.htm|work=Praxis|accessdate=20 October 2011}}</ref> 
The continuous efforts of some of the social reformers of the country like Rettamalai Srinivasa Paraiyar, Ayothidas Pandithar, [[Jyotiba Phule]], [[Bhimrao Ambedkar|Babasaheb Ambedkar]], [[Shahu IV|Chhatrapati Sahu ji Maharaj]] and others, worked to eradicate "casteism".  . 

==Advances under the Reservations System==. 
The [[public sector]] jobs are divided into 4 categories:Class I (or Group A), Class II (or Group B), Class III (or Group C) and Class IV (or Group D). The Class I employees take up 2.2% of the public sector [[workforce]], the Class II employees take up 3.3% of the public sector workforce,the Class III [[employees]] take up 66.8% of the public sector workforce, and the Class IV employees take up 27.2% of the public sector workforce. <ref name= "Ambedkar">{{cite web|title=Chapter 3- An Assessment of Reservations (Pg 32)|url=http://www.ambedkar.org/News/reservationinindia.pdf|work=News|publisher=Dalit Bahujan Media|accessdate=17 November 2011}}</ref>

==Critiques of the Reservations System==. 
A larger part of the Indian population does not fall under the categories of SCs, STs or OBCs. According to the 2001 census, the SCs and STs represent 24.90% of the population, out of which 16.20% are SCs and 8.10% are STs. <ref>{{cite web|title=Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Population 2001 Census - India|url=http://delhiplanning.nic.in/Economic%20Survey/ES2007-08/T18.pdf|work=Planning Department|accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref> Since these castes are a minority and yet hold more jobs {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} than the rest of the Indian population, there is a debate over the system. The following arguments have been put forth by Anti-Reservationists and Pro-Reservationists.  .

|Opponents are unhappy because they believe that a moral injustice is being committed and [[Equal opportunity|equality of opportunity]] is eroded because of the reservation system.

They also believe that reservations are used for political benefits rather than social benefits. <ref name="The Struggle for Equality:Caste in Indian Politics" />
