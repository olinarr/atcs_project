'''Symbolic racism''' (also known as symbolic prejudice) is a set of beliefs in which the subject views a certain [[Race (classification of humans)|race]] as an abstract group rather than as specific individuals (Whitley & Kite, 2010). These beliefs include the [[stereotype]] of Black people being morally inferior to White people, violating White American values such as ‘hard-working’ or ‘independent.’ These beliefs cause the subject to [[discriminate]] against a certain race and justify it on a non-racial [[bias]], but the beliefs operate to sustain the racial [[status quo]]. <ref>• McConahay, J.B., & Hough, J.C., Jr. (1976). Symbolic racism. Journal of Social Issues, 32(2), 23-45. </ref> Some prejudiced people do not view symbolic racism as prejudice since it is not linked directly to race but indirectly through social and political issues. <ref>• McConahay, J.B., Hardee, B.B., & Batts, V. (1981). Has racism declined in America? It depends on who is asking and what is asked. Journal of Conflict Resolution, 25, 563-579. </ref>

Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 37, 95-150. </ref>(2005) created 5 characterizing themes that justify the opposition to social policies designed to promote equality, while still supporting the abstract idea of equality:
1. Racial prejudice and discrimination no longer exists,
2. Any Black-White differences in economic outcomes is a result of Black people’s lack of motivation to work hard,
3. Black people’s anger over [[inequality]] is unjustified since they are unwilling to work to get what they want,
4. Black people seek special favors rather than working to get ahead, and
5. Relative to white people, Black people have been getting more economically than they deserve . 

==History== . 

After the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], symbolic racism started to gain notoriety as many in America found old-fashioned (or “[[Jim Crow]]”) racism dissolving along with [[segregation]].  Symbolic racism is a term that was coined by David Sears & John McConahay <ref>• Sears, D.O., & McConahay, J.B. (1973). The politics of violence: The new urban Blacks and the Watts riot. Boston. Houghton-Mifflin. </ref>(1973) to explain why most White Americans supported principles of equality for Black Americans but less than half were willing to support programs designed to implement these principles. While equal rights are fought for vehemently, symbolic racism is still prominent today in the United States and possibly acts as a mask for old-fashioned racism sentiments.  . 

==Examples== . 

[[Public opinion]] researchers polled White Americans in the early 1970s on their backing for racial equality and their support for government intervention that would enforce equality. The results revealed high levels of support from White Americans, ranging from 75 percent to nearly 100 percent, regarding the principles for school integration, equal opportunity employment, and open housing.  Support from the same White Americans was significantly lower for implementation of these abstract principles; less than 50% supported implementation. <ref>• Schuman, H., Steeh,C., Bobo, L., & Krysan, M.

[[College]] students who had completed a modern-symbolic prejudice measure early in the [[semester]] evaluated the [[résumé]]s of 10 job applicants and recommend two.  The applicants consisted of three qualified Blacks, two qualified Whites, and five unqualified Whites. The students were split into two groups: one containing students rated high in modern-symbolic prejudice and once containing students rated low.  Each student received a [[memo]] from the president of the company. Half of the students obtained memos in which the president of the company asked the student to abstain from hiring a worker of a minority group because the person hired would be dealing mainly with White employees. The memo for the second group did not contain this message from the president.  The results were very stark between the groups. The group that did not receive any reasoning from the president of the company recommended a Black candidate 61% of the time, regardless of high or low rated modern-symbolic prejudice. In the group that had received justification from the president to abstain from minority hiring, 37% of the students low in modern-symbolic prejudice recommended a Black candidate whereas only 18% of the students high in modern-symbolic prejudice recommended a Black candidate.  The results show that symbolic prejudice is expressed most strongly when non-explicitly racist justifications are given for discriminatory action. <ref>• Brief, A.P., Dietz, J., Cohen, R.R., Pugh, S.D., & Vaslow, J.B.
