The use of '''all-women shortlists''' ('''AWS''') is the [[affirmative action|political practice]] intended to increase the proportion of female [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) in the [[United Kingdom]] by allowing only women to stand in particular [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituencies]] for a particular [[political party]]. <ref name="independent">{{Cite news| last = McSmith | first = Andy | title = The Big Question: Are all-women shortlists the best way to achieve equality in Parliament? | publisher = The Independent | date = 23 August 2006 | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-big-question-are-allwomen-shortlists-the-best-way-to-achieve-equality-in-parliament-412987.html | accessdate = 31 December 2008 | location=London}}</ref><ref>http://www.questia.com/PM.qst;jsessionid=KvjZvj3bpG1J1RvJJ5c2LvvqPbMBzJ7LGtQ7hTYmDdG19z2Pm9QN!968782365!846852835?a=o&d=5023216669</ref> Though the practice is available to all parties, only the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] uses it. <ref name="top">{{Cite web|url=http://hansardsociety.org.uk/blogs/publications/archive/2007/10/01/Women-at-the-Top-2005.aspx | author = Sarah Childs, Joni Lovenduski and Rosie Campbell |title=Women at the Top 2005: Changing Numbers, Changing Politics? |accessdate=31 December 2008 |publisher=[[Hansard Society]] |date=November 2005}}</ref> [[Jacqui Smith]], who served as [[Home Secretary]], was one prominent politician elected on an all-women shortlist. <ref name = "Smith">{{Cite news|title=Jacqui Smith: the rise and fall |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/uknews/5429425/Jacqui-Smith-the-rise-and-fall.html |date= 2 June 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=11 August 2009 | location=London}}</ref><ref name="express.co.uk">http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/127912/Thatcher-the-woman-who-hasn-t-an-equal</ref> . 

==United Kingdom==. 
===Background===. 
In the 1990s in the United Kingdom, women constituted less than 10% of parliamentary MPs. <ref name="peake">{{Cite book|editors=Tonge, Jonathan; Geddes, Andrew |author=Peake, Lucy |title=Labour's landslide: the British general election 1997 |publisher=Manchester University Press |location=Manchester |year=1997 |pages= 165–178|isbn=0-7190-5159-2 |oclc= |chapter=Women in the campaign and in the commons |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=F-za8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA165}}</ref> Political parties used various strategies to increase female representation, including encouraging women to stand and constituency associations to select them, and providing special training for potential women candidates. <ref name="peake"/>
Another strategy, the creation of all-women shortlists, is an affirmative action strategy making compulsory the selection of women candidates in some constituencies. <ref name="peake"/><ref name="bacchi"/>  . 

The strategy has been criticised as undemocratic, as "bypassing competitive principles and hence as ignoring the merit principle,"  and as "a form of discrimination against men."

===1997 election===. 
[[File:Smith, Jacqui (crop).jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Jacqui Smith]], the first British female Home Secretary, was elected using an AWS. <ref name = "Smith"/>]]
Labour used all-women shortlists to select candidates in half of all winnable seats for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], with the aim of reaching 100 women MPs post-election, a goal that was reached. <ref name="peake"/> The shortlists provoked controversy, however. In 1996 Labour party branches in [[Croydon Central]], [[Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (UK Parliament constituency)|Merthyr Tydfil & Rhymney]], [[Bishop Auckland (UK Parliament constituency)|Bishop Auckland]] and [[Slough (UK Parliament constituency)|Slough]] all submitted hostile motions criticising the policy. <ref name="independent2" />  . 

Concern about such sex discrimination was especially strong in Slough where the local party refused to even cooperate in selecting a candidate after having an AWS imposed. <ref>{{Cite news|last=Rentoul |first=John |coauthors=Donald Macintyre |title=Blair prepares to drop all-women shortlists |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/blair-prepares-to-drop-allwomen-shortlists-1593214.html |date=26 July 1995 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=11 August 2009 | location=London}}</ref> Another concern was that AWS were being used as a device to keep out certain men who might have made trouble for [[Tony Blair]], [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] at the time. <ref name="independent" /> Labour leader [[Tony Blair]] stated that AWS were "not ideal at all" in 1995. <ref>{{Cite news|last=Rentoul |first=John |title=Labour faces test over quotas for women MPs |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/labour-faces-test-over-quotas-for-women-mps-1525198.html |date=11 December 1995 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=11 August 2009 | location=London}}</ref>  . 

In December 1995, Peter Jepson and Roger Dyas-Elliott, prevented from standing on Labour shortlists because of their gender, challenged the policy in court. <ref name="independent2">{{Cite news|last=Wynn Davies |first=Patricia |title=All-women lists face new legal challenge |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/allwomen-lists-face-new-legal-challenge-1597219.html |date=21 August 1995 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=11 August 2009 | location=London}}</ref> Supported by the [[Equal Opportunities Commission]], they claimed that they had been illegally barred from applying to be considered to represent the party and that the policy contradicted Labour's policy of aiming to promote equality of opportunity.

The 34 candidates who had already been selected by all-women shortlists were not required to seek re-selection, but all 14 unfinished all-women shortlist selections were suspended. <ref name="independent3" /> Dr Jepson and Mr Dyas-Elliott did not seek compensation for their loss. <ref name="independent3" />
In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], 35 out of 38 Labour AWS candidates were successful. <ref name=HOCL-snpc-05057>{{citation|url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-05057.pdf|title=All-women shortlists|publisher=[[House of Commons Library]]|id=SN/PC/05057|date=29 April 2009|author=Richard Kelly and Isobel White|accessdate=2009-06-23}}</ref><ref name="cutts"/> . 

The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] also opposed gender quotas, preferring to persuade constituencies to select female candidates in winnable seats. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Lena Krook |first=Mona |coauthors=Joni Lovenduski and Judith Squires |title=Gender quotes in the context of citizenship models |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=H8kkYXBKSXYC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA204#v=onepage&q=&f=false |year=2006 |work=Women, quotas and politics |publisher=Taylor & Francis |accessdate=11 August 2009}}</ref> . 

Prior to the 1999 European parliament elections, the Liberal Democrats used a system called "zipping" in which equal numbers of men and women were elected as MEPs. <ref name="independent" /> . 

===2005 election===. 
Following the reduction in women MPs after the 2001 general election and increased lobbying by gender equality advocates, Labour introduced the [[Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002]], which allows parties to use positive discrimination in the selection of candidates. <ref name="top" /><ref name="cutts"/><ref>{{Cite news|title=All-women shortlists clear new hurdle |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/1721937.stm |date=21 December 2001 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=11 August 2009}}</ref> They will remain legalized until the end of 2015, due to the "Sunset Clause". <ref>{{Cite news|last= King |first= Oliver |title= All-women shortlists a must, says report |publisher = [[The Guardian]] |date= 15 November 2005 |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2005/nov/15/women.gender | accessdate= 31 December 2008 | location=London}}</ref>  . 

In contrast, in 2001 the [[Liberal Democrats]] rejected a proposal to use AWS, suggesting such shortlists were illiberal and unnecessary. <ref name=bbc2001/> Prominent women MPs of the party opposed the all-women shortlists. <ref name="independent" /> Party members argued that the main problem was not discrimination, but a lack of female candidates. <ref name="independent" /><ref name=bbc2001/> Instead the party set a target of having 40% female candidates in winnable seats. <ref name=bbc2001>{{Cite news|title=Lib Dems reject women-only lists |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1564419.stm |date=27 September 2001 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=11 August 2009}}</ref> . 

In the 2005 General election, the shortlists helped to increase the number of female MPs in Parliament to 128, with the Labour Party's 98 women constituting 77% of the total. <ref name="independent"/><ref name="cutts">{{Cite journal|last=Cutts|first=D|coauthors=Sarah Childs, Fieldhouse, E A.  |year=2008|title=This is what happens when you don?t listen?

===2010 election===. 
A Speaker's conference was set up in 2008 to study the reasons why MPs were predominantly white, male and able-bodied. An interim report released in July 2009  called for women to make up at least fifty percent of new candidates at the following general election. <ref name=guardian2009/> However, all-women shortlists continued to elicit criticism.  [[Ann Widdecombe]] criticised the use of AWS stating that women in the past who fought for equality such as the [[Suffragette]]s "wanted equal opportunities not special privileges" and "they [[Emily Davison|would have thrown themselves under the King's horse]] to protest against positive discrimination and all-women shortlists". <ref>{{Cite web|last=Widdecombe |first=Ann |title=EDM 895A2 - 90th ANNIVERSARY OF THE REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE ACT 1918 |url=http://edmi.parliament.uk/EDMi/EDMDetails.aspx?EDMID=35098&SESSION=891 |date=7 February 2008 |work=Early Day Motions |publisher=UK Parliament |accessdate=11 August 2009}}</ref>   . 

[[Diane Abbott]], one of the early supporters of all women shortlists criticised their failure to recruit [[ethnic minority]] women into politics, stating that they had in effect "been all white women shortlists" <ref>http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/spconf/uc167-v/uc16702.htm</ref> As evidence of this she cited the 1997 Parliamentary intake, where none of the MPs selected using all women shortlists was black. <ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jul/10/gender.women | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=A race against time | first=Diane | last=Abbott | date=10 July 2008 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}</ref>
Conservative leader [[David Cameron]] tried to institute AWS in 2006. There was opposition from some female MPs, such as [[Nadine Dorries]] and [[Ann Widdecombe]]. <ref>{{Cite news| last = Jones | first = George | title = Tories shy away from all-women shortlists | publisher = The Daily Telegraph | date = 22 Aug 2006 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1526943/Tories-shy-away-from-all-women-shortlists.html | accessdate = 31 December 2008 | location=London}}</ref>   . 

However, in October 2009, the subsequent Conservative leader, [[David Cameron]] stated that the under-representation of ethnic minorities women and ethnic minorities was "a real problem for parliament and for my party", and reversed his opposition to AWS. <ref name=guardian2009>{{Cite news|authors= Allegra Stratton and Andrew Sparrow  |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/oct/20/cameron-all-women-shortlists |title=David Cameron to reverse opposition to all-women shortlists |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |accessdate=2010-05-08| date=20 October 2009 |location=London}}</ref> In February 2010 he indicated that he would impose AWS because the pace of change towards the selection of more women MPs had been too slow. <ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/7265221/David-Cameron-I-will-impose-all-women-shortlists.html The Telegraph 18/2/10]</ref>
In 2009, Liberal Democrat party leader [[Nick Clegg]] stated that he would consider introducing all-women shortlists if the number of female MPs did not increase following the next election, but he did not see this as a long-term solution for the unrepresentative nature of parliament. <ref name=guardian2009/> . 

===Impact===. 
All-women shortlists had been credited with breaking down prejudices that impeded the selection of women and discouraged women from offering their candidacy. <ref name="independent"/>  In both 1997 and 2005, fifty per cent of women MPs elected were selected from all-women shortlists. <ref name="cutts"/>  . 

The increase in women in politics brought increased parliamentary priority to issues such as women's health, domestic violence, childcare. <ref name="cutts"/> In addition, the increased number of women MPs and greater focus on women's concerns likely resulted in increased female support for Labour at the polls. <ref name="cutts"/>  AWS may also have made it easier for women to be selected non all-women shortlist seats. <ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-big-question-are-allwomen-shortlists-the-best-way-to-achieve-equality-in-parliament-412987.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=The Big Question: Are all-women shortlists the best way to achieve equality in Parliament? | first=Andy | last=McSmith | date=23 August 2006 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}</ref> The shortlists also gave rise to the appointment of Britain's first female Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith in June 2007.  . 

==Other countries==. 
Similar party reservations for female candidates have been utilized by political parties in Norway, Sweden and Denmark. In 1983, the [[Norwegian Labour Party]] mandated that "at all elections and nominations both sexes must be represented by at least 40 per cent", and in 1994, the [[Swedish Social Democratic Workers' Party]] mandated  "every second on the list a woman", which meant that male and female candidates would be alternated between each other on the [[party list]] of preferred candidates. In 1988, the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Danish Social Democrats]] "each sex has the right to a representation of at least 40 per cent of the Social Democratic candidates for local and regional elections. If there is not a sufficient number of candidates from each sex, this right will not fully come into effect"; however, this party law was abolished in 1996. <ref>[http://archive.idea.int/women/parl/ch4c.htm]</ref> .
