An '''affirmative action bake sale''' is a campus protest event used by student groups to illustrate criticism of [[affirmative action]] policies, especially as they relate to [[college]] and [[graduate school]] admissions.  According to one bake sale student leader, the goal of the technique is to "bring the issue of affirmative action down to everyday terms." <ref name=DailyBruin>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070208102115/http://www.dailybruin.ucla.edu/news/2003/feb/14/democrats-riled-by-race--gende/ Democrats riled by race-, gender-biased bake sale], Daily Bruin</ref> . 

The [[bake sale]]s offer to sell cookies at different prices depending on the customer's [[Race (classification of humans)|race]] and [[gender|sex]], imitating the racial and sexual preference practices of affirmative action. One idea of such [[bake sale]]s is to demonstrate analogies between [[price discrimination]] and [[affirmative action]]. A typical pricing structure charges $1.00 for [[White]] males, $.75 for White females, $.50 for [[Latino]], [[Black]], [[Asia|Asian]], and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] males and $.25 for Latino, Black, Asian, and Native American females.  The bake sales' hosts do not support this kind of preferential treatment; rather, they argue that this preferential pricing is analogous to the preferential treatment created by affirmative action policies.  . 

These bake sales have been organized at many schools across the U.S., sometimes annually. Affirmative action bake sales have also taken place at the [[University of Pretoria]] in [[South Africa]], the latest (in 2008) having been forcibly broken up by campus security. <ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090501140947/http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,,2-7-1442_2304390,00.html 'AA/BEE' cake sale broken up (News24)]</ref> . 

==Controversy & criticism==. 
The bake sales have met opposition, drawing crowds of students, sometimes facing opposition or restriction from campus administrations,<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|last=Jones |first=Ashby |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2009/06/23/bucknell-and-the-affirmative-action-bakesale/ |title=Bucknell and the ‘Affirmative-Action Bakesale’ - Law Blog - WSJ |publisher=Blogs.wsj.com |date=2009-06-23 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bucknell.edu/x49604.xml |title=BUCC donut sale rejected by administration &#124;&#124; The Bucknellian &#124;&#124; Bucknell University |publisher=Bucknell.edu |date=2009-04-24 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thefire.org/article/12461.html |title=John Stossel Discusses Bucknell's 'Affirmative Action Bake Sale' (and His Own) with Fox News' Megyn Kelly; Watch FIRE on 'Stossel' Tonight |publisher=FIRE |date=2010-11-11 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}</ref> often being accused of [[racism]], and sometimes even being attacked. <ref name="CNN 2003">[http://web.archive.org/web/20080116131828/http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/West/12/24/affirmative.bake.sale.ap/ Bake sales used to protest affirmative action], CNN, December 24, 2003 BROKEN LINK</ref>  Additionally, some administrators have been accused of [[censorship]] and inappropriately advocating a political position. <ref name="CNN 2003"/>  The 2007 documentary ''[[Indoctrinate U]]'' showed how some such censorship is often institutionalized into the university system.  . 

Responding to an affirmative action bake sale being attacked at the University of Washington, the school's Board of Regents President Jerry Grinstein presented the opinion of many opponents of these events when he described "the statements [...] in putting on a bake sale about affirmative action were tasteless, divisive and hurtful to many members of the university community."<ref name="CNN 2003"/> The student leader of a bake sale at UCLA addressed this issue of divisiveness, saying "we wanted to show how affirmative action is racial division, not racial reconciliation."<ref name=DailyBruin /> Similarly, administrators at [[Bucknell University]] claimed that the bake sales violated the [[private university]]'s discrimination policy. <ref>{{cite web|author=New Century Foundation |url=http://www.amren.com/mtnews/archives/2009/06/bucknell_bake_s.php |title=Bucknell Bake Sale Sparks First Amendment Debate :: American Renaissance News |publisher=Amren.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-28}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1"/> . 

Other criticisms of the concept claim that these bake sales do not take into account ingrained social factors that favor whites. An opinion column in the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' after a similar sale took place at [[Texas A&M University]] held that "Actions like these reinforce the common misconception that affirmative action policies give academically unqualified minority students a get-into-college-free card, and they ignore historical discrimination that denied nonwhites opportunities to be successful at any price, no matter their talents or intelligence." The editorial also praised school officials for not shutting down the sale. <ref>{{cite news
