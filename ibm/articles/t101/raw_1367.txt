{{Rights}}
The term [[Minority]] Rights embodies two separate concepts: first, normal individual [[right]]s as applied to members of racial, [[ethnic]], class, religious, linguistic or sexual minorities, and second, [[collective rights]] accorded to minority groups. The term may also apply simply to individual rights of anyone who is not part of a majority decision.  . 

[[Civil rights movement]]s often seek to ensure that individual rights are not denied on the basis of membership in a minority group.  . 

There are many political bodies which also feature minority group rights. This might be seen in [[affirmative action]] quotas, or in guaranteed minority representation in a [[consociational state]].  . 

==Minority Rights in National and International Law== . 

Minority rights were codified in Austrian law in 1867. <ref>[http://www.verfassungen.de/at/stgg67-2.htm Staatsgrundgesetz vom 21. Dezember 1867 (R.G.Bl. 142/1867), über die allgemeinen Rechte der Staatsbürger für die im Reichsrate vertretenen Königreiche und Länder] — see Article 19{{de icon}}</ref> Minority rights, as applying to ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities and indigenous peoples, are an integral part of [[international human rights law]]. Like [[children's rights]], [[women's rights]] and [[refugee]] rights, minority rights are a legal framework designed to ensure that a specific group which is in a vulnerable, disadvantaged or marginalised position in society, is able to achieve equality and is protected from persecution. The first post-war international treaty to protect minorities, designed to protect them from the greatest threat to their existence, was the U.N. [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]].  . 

Subsequent human rights standards that codify minority rights include the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (Article 27), the [[United Nations]] Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, two [[Council of Europe]] treaties (the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]] and the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], and the [[OSCE]] Copenhagen Document of 1990.  . 

Minority rights cover protection of existence, protection from discrimination and persecution, protection and promotion of identity, and participation in political life. For the rights of [[LGBT]], [[The Yogyakarta Principles]] have been approved by the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] and for the rights of persons with [[disability|disabilities]], the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] was adopted by [[United Nations General Assembly]].  . 

To protect minority rights, many countries have specific laws and/or commissions or [[ombudsman]] institutions (for example the Hungarian Parliamentary Commissioner for National and Ethnic Minorities Rights). <ref>[http://www.obh.hu/nekh/en/index.htm Homepage of the Parliamentary Commissioner]</ref> . 

While initially, the United Nations treated [[indigenous peoples]] as a sub-category of minorities, there is an expanding body of international law specifically devoted to them, in particular [[Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989|Convention 169]] of the [[International Labour Organization]] and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (adopted 14 September 2007).  . 

Attempts to codify the rights of sexual minorities in international human rights law have met with strong opposition from a number of member states of the United Nations.  . 

== National Minorities in the Law of the EC/EU ==. 
The direct role of the [[European Union]] (and also the Law of the EU/EC ) in the area of protection of national minorities  is still very limited (likewise the general protection of [[human rights]]). The EU has relied on general [[international law]] and a European regional system of international law (based on the [[Council of Europe]], [[OSCE]] etc.) and in a case of necessity accepted their norms. But the “de-economisation of European integration”, which started in the 1990s, is changing this situation. The political relevance of national minorities' protection is very high. 
Now (2009) although a protection of the national minorities has not become a generally accepted legally binding principle of the EU, in  several legal acts issues of national minorities are mentioned. In external relations protection of national minorities became one of the main criteria for cooperation with the EU or  accession. <ref>[[Daniel Šmihula]] (2008). ''National Minorities in the Law of the EC/EU'' in Romanian Journal of European Affairs, Vol. 8 no. 3, Sep. 2008, pp.51-81.
