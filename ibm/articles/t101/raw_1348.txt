'''Equality before the law''' or '''equality under the law''' or '''legal egalitarianism''' is the principle under which each individual is subject to the same laws. <ref name=un>[http://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/humanrights/declaration/7.asp 7.],  description of the UN declaration article 7, the United Nations</ref> . 

Article 7 of the [[UN]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states that "''All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law.''"<ref name=un/> . 

According to the [[UN]], this principle is particularly important to the [[minority group|minorities]] and to the [[poverty|poor]]. <ref name=un/> . 

Thus, the law and the judges must treat everybody by the same laws regardless of their [[gender]], [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], [[socio-economic status]] etc, without [[privilege (social inequality)|privilege]].  . 

Equality before the law is one of the basic principles of [[classical liberalism]]. <ref name=kukathas/><ref name=evans/> . 

==History==. 
In [[Pericles' Funeral Oration|his famous funeral oration]] of 431 BC, the [[Athens|Athenian]] leader [[Pericles]] discussed this concept. This may be the first known instance.  . 

<blockquote>"If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way"<ref>Thucydides, ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/plpwr10.txt The History of the Peloponnesian War]'', Written 431 B.C.E, Translated by [[Richard Crawley]] (1874), retrieved via Project Gutenberg. </ref></blockquote> . 

==Classical liberalism==. 
Classical liberalism calls for equality before the law, not for [[equality of outcome]]. <ref name=kukathas>[[Chandran Kukathas]], "Ethical Pluralism from a Classical Liberal Perspective," in ''The Many and the One: Religious and Secular Perspectives on Ethical Pluralism in the Modern World'', ed. Richard Madsen and Tracy B. Strong, Ethikon Series in Comparative Ethics (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2003), 61 (ISBN 0-691-09993-6). </ref> Classical liberalism opposes pursuing [[group rights]] at the expense of [[individual rights]]. <ref name=evans>Mark Evans, ed., ''Edinburgh Companion to Contemporary Liberalism: Evidence and Experience'' (London: Routledge, 2001), 55 (ISBN 1-57958-339-3). </ref> . 

==Feminism==. 
Original [[Women's rights movement]] was part of the classical liberal movement calling for equality before the law regardless of gender. <ref name=fem>[http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa256.pdf Feminist Jurisprudence: Equal Rights or Neo-Paternalism?], Michael Weiss and Cathy Young, Policy Analysis No. 256, Cato Institute, June 19, 1996, pages 1-2</ref>  . 

Still in 1988 the later supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote: "Generalizations about the way women or men are ... cannot guide me reliably in making decisions about particular individuals". <ref name=rosen>Jeff Rosen, "The Book of Ruth," New Republic, August 2, 1993, p. 19. </ref> In an [[ACLU]]'s s Women's Rights Project in the 1970s Ginsburg challenged the laws that gave health service benefits to wives of servicemen but not to husbands of servicewomen and prohibited women from certain businesses including running a bar alone. <ref name=fem/> . 

However, some [[radical feminists]] have opposed equality before the law, because they think that it maintains the weak position of the weak. <ref>Martha Chamallas, "Feminist Constructions of Objectivity: Multiple Perspectives in Sexual and Racial Harassment Litigation," Texas Journal of Women and the Law 1 (1992): 95, 131, 125. </ref> . 

==Nebraska==. 
The phrase "Equality before the law" is the motto of the [[State of Nebraska]] and appears on its [[seal of Nebraska|state seal]].  . 

==Parricide law==. 
The Article 200 of the [[Criminal Code of Japan]]—the penalty regarding [[parricide]]—was claimed to be unconstitutional for violating the equality under the law, and, the [[Supreme Court of Japan]] judged the Article unconstitutional in 1973 as a result of the trial of the [[Tochigi patricide case]]. <ref>Dean, Meryll (2002). [http://books.google.co.jp/books?id=OohyicuN-GIC&pg=PA535#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Japanese legal system'']. [[Routledge]] via [[Google Books]]. p. 535</ref> .
