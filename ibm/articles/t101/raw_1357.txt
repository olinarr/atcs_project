'''Black Economic Empowerment''' ('''BEE''') is a programme launched by the [[Government of South Africa|South African government]] to redress the inequalities of [[Apartheid]] by giving previously disadvantaged groups (black Africans, [[Coloured people|Coloured]]s, [[Indian South Africans|Indians]] and some [[Chinese South Africans|Chinese]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Chinese are declared to be Black, so are Chinese are Fully Black? |work=BEE Partner, South Africa Economy Watch |url=http://beepartner.com/2008/06/30/chinese-are-declared-to-be-black-so-are-chinese-are-fully-black/ |accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref>--who are SA citizens, economic opportunities previously not available to them. It includes measures such as [[Affirmative_action#South_Africa|Employment Equity]], skills development, ownership, management, socioeconomic development and preferential procurement.  . 

== Rationale ==. 
After the transition of [[Apartheid]] in 1994, it was decided by the government of the [[African National Congress]] that direct intervention in the distribution of assets and opportunities was needed to resolve the economic disparities created by Apartheid policies which had favoured white business owners. BEE intended to transform the economy to be representative of the [[demographics]], specifically race demographics of the country. BEE was defined in the 2001 Commission Report as follows, . 

{{Quotation|"It is an integrated and coherent socio-economic process. It is located within the context of the country's nation transformation programme, namely the RDP (Reconstruction and Development Programme). It is aimed at redressing the imbalances of the past by seeking to substantially and equitably transfer and confer ownership, management and control of South Africa's financial and economic resources to the majority of the citizens. It seeks to ensure broader and meaningful participation in the economy by black people to achieve sustainable development and prosperity."|BEE Commission Report, pg. 2}} . 

Successful implementers of BEE also see it as a means to create economic growth in South Africa, and as vital to their corporate strategy.  . 

However, the ANC ruling party does not consider direct state intervention in the redistribution of assets, jobs or opportunities along racial lines to be racial discrimination. Arguably, if not for the constitution, and interferance by other political parties, the ANC government would have followed the example of Zimbabwe.  . 

== Legislation ==. 
On 9 February, 2007, the first BEE Codes of Good Practice was gazetted by the South-African Government. This newest release of the Codes is also known as [[Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment]] or [[B-BBEE]] . 

This included the following Codes:
*Code 100 – [[Ownership]]
*Code 200 – [[Management & Control]]
*Code 300 – [[Employment Equity]]
*Code 400 – [[Skills Development]]
*Code 500 – [[Preferential Procurement]]
*Code 600 – [[Enterprise Development]]
*Code 700 – [[Socioeconomic development]]
*Codes 800 - [[807 - Qualifying Small Enterprises]] . 

The following sector scorecards have also been gazetted (in terms of section 12):
*Financial Sector Scorecard <ref>{{cite web |title=Codes of Good Practice on Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment - Financial Sector Charter |work=Department of Trade and Industry |url=http://www.dti.gov.za/bee/beecharters/gazetteno610.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref>
*Construction Sector Scorecard<ref>{{cite web |title=Codes of Good Practice on Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment - Construction Sector Charter |work=Department of Trade and Industry |url=http://www.dti.gov.za/bee/beecharters/gazetteno616.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref>
*Tourism Sector Code <ref>{{cite web |title=Codes of Good Practice on Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment - Tourism Sector Codes |work=Department of Trade and Industry |url=http://www.thedti.gov.za/bee/beecharters/tourism.pdf |format=PDF|}}</ref> . 

Also gazetted were general guidelines and definitions, among which, the definition of the beneficiaries of BEE. The definition is the same as that of the Black Economic Empowerment Act of 2003 which states that "black people" is a generic term which means Africans, Coloureds and Indians and included provisions to ensure that they must have been South African citizens prior to 1994. <ref>{{cite web |title=Codes of Good Practice on Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment - Schedule 1, Interpretation and Definitions |work=Department of Trade and Industry |url=http://www.dti.gov.za/bee/beecharters/schedule1.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2007-08-23}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  The fact that Chinese individuals (some of whom were classified as Coloureds under Apartheid, others as [[honorary white]]), who were also submitted to legal discrimination prior to 1990 (but exempt from the Group Areas Act as of 1984 when the Group Areas Amendment Act was promulgated), have been excluded as beneficiaries of  black empowerment, has led to a renewed media debate regarding the definition of “black” in current legislation. <ref>{{cite web |author=Vuyo Jack |title=Chinese people fall in grey area of BEE scorecard |work=Business Report |date=2007-04-29 |url=http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=553&fArticleId=3803052 |accessdate=2007-08-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927011730/http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=553&fArticleId=3803052 |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}</ref>  As of 2008, Chinese people have been reclassified as "black" after The Chinese Association of South Africa took the South African government to court and won. <ref>{{cite web |title=S Africa Chinese 'become black' |work=BBC News |date=2008-06-18 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7461099.stm |accessdate=2011-06-27}}</ref> . 

The BEE legislation is supported and functions in conjunction with various other forms of Legislation, including the Employment Equity Act, Skills Development Act, Preferential Procurement Framework and others.  . 

The legislation was developed through numerous task teams and have taken more than 3 years to be gazetted since the first Act (December 2003) and the first Codes of Good Practice  released in November 2005 which addressed Statement 100 and 200. Subsequent Codes were released in December 2006 addressing Codes 300 to 700. Based on public and stakeholder comments, the final codes were adjusted and gazetted. <ref>{{cite web |title=The BEE Codes of Good Practice |work=Department of Trade and Industry |url=http://www.dti.gov.za/bee/beecodes.htm |accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref> . 

==Scorecards==. 
Enterprises may be rated based on various scorecards, however only the following have been gazetted as of February 2007:<ref>{{cite web |title=BB-BEE Codes of Good Practice |work=Department of Trade and Industry |url=http://www.dti.gov.za/publications/BB-BEE%20Codes%20of%20Good%20Practice%20Booklet121206.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref> . 

*Generic Broad Based Scorecard
*Generic Narrow Based Scorecard
*[[Qualifying Small Enterprises]] Narrow Based Scorecard
*[[Qualifying Small Enterprises]] Broad Based Scorecard
*Financial Sector Scorecard
*Construction Sector Scorecard . 

The last two - Financial Sector scorecard and Construction Sector scorecard have not been passed into law. They were gazetted under section 12 of the act, which is for comment only. They will need to be gazetted in terms of section 9 of the act to become an official sector code. Until that happens all enterprises falling in these two industries are required to use the codes of good practice in producing a scorecard.  . 

Significant leniency for Small Enterprises has been built into the gazetted codes. Based on the Qualifying Small Enterprises Codes, all companies with a turnover under R5 million p.a. is completely exempt from BEE and automatically qualifies as a level 4 contributor or achieves 100% BEE Contribution Recognition.  .

== Exemption ==. 
Small businesses, generally with a turnover of less than R5m, are considered to be [[Exempted Micro Enterprises]] and do not need to be measured against the BEE scorecards as stated above.  . 

However, these businesses are often forced to employ people based on skin colour to avoid discrimination by potential clients, who (if having a turnover larger that R5m) are generally still subject to BEE regulations on choosing business partners, suppliers or service providers.  . 

== Criticism ==. 
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2007}}
Critics argue that BEE's aim was to attempt to create equality of the workforce of South Africa as a whole by enforcing the advantaging of the previously disadvantaged and the disadvantaging the previously advantaged. This results in businesses having to consider the social background of any potential applicant instead of making decisions purely based on qualifications and experience (News Daily, May 24, 2004), resulting in a system in which one's race is often the determining factor in finding employment. Such a system is morally unconstitutional, but the ruling ANC party has used its control of parliament to prevent a political reversal of this system.  . 

The BEE system has led to the creation of a new 'class' of citizen, often labelled the 'BEEelite' or as 'tender-prenuers' (the racist BEE policies used to give state tenders almost exclusively to black businesses regardless of competency, track record, or public opinion). Those, who by using the advantage afforded to them by their skin colour have enriched themselves at the cost of the poor, or by out-performing functional, capable companies in the same manner, are labelled by these names. This results in the closure, or downsizing of many white owned companies, contributing to the unemployment problem of a country already plagued by sky-rocketing unemployment rates.  . 

Instead of using this type of policy, it has been suggested by critics{{Who|date=February 2011}} that a policy of qualification equality should be used. This would allow businesses to focus on employing the person with the highest qualifications, the most experience and the best recommendations. To allow previously disadvantaged individuals to achieve these qualifications and experience, critics of BEE say that the government should place more emphasis on secondary and tertiary education, as well as subsidise companies wishing to employ entry level applicants, or fund tertiary education for students from previously disadvantaged communities.  . 

In response to criticism, the South African Government launched [[Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment]] which is the current gazetted framework for addressing Black Empowerment beyond enriching a few.  . 

BEE has also been criticized for creating a [[brain drain]], where the qualified white expertise is leaving for areas where they would not be discriminated against. [[Inkatha Freedom Party]] leader [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi]] is a strong critic of BEE and supports this view. He has stated that "the government's reckless implementation of the affirmative action policy is forcing many white people to leave the country in search of work, creating a skills shortage crisis". <ref>{{cite web |title=Buthelezi slams affirmative action |date=2007-02-01 |work=Mail & Guardian |url=http://www.mg.co.za/articlepage.aspx?area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__national/&articleid=297671 |accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref>
Archbishop Desmond Tutu has warned that South Africa is sitting on a "powder keg" because millions are living in "dehumanising poverty" stating that Black Economic Empowerment only serves an elite few. <ref>{{cite web |title=Tutu warns of poverty 'powder keg'  |date=2004-11-23 |work=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4035809.stm |accessdate=2009-11-12}}</ref> .
