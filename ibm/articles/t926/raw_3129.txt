'''ASEAN Free Trade Area''' ('''AFTA''')<ref>[http://www.aseansec.org/4920.htm AFTA & FTAs (ASEAN Secretariat)]</ref> is a [[trade bloc]] agreement by the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] supporting local manufacturing in all ASEAN countries.  . 

The AFTA agreement was signed on 28 January 1992 in Singapore. When the AFTA agreement was originally signed, ASEAN had six members, namely, [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]] and [[Thailand]]. [[Vietnam]] joined in 1995, [[Laos]] and [[Myanmar]] in 1997 and [[Cambodia]] in 1999. AFTA now comprises ten countries of ASEAN. All the four latecomers were required to sign the AFTA agreement in order to join ASEAN, but were given longer time frames in which to meet AFTA's tariff reduction obligations.  . 

The primary goals of AFTA seek to:
*Increase ASEAN's competitive edge as a production base in the world market through the elimination, within ASEAN, of [[tariffs]] and non-tariff barriers; and
*Attract more [[foreign direct investment]] to ASEAN.  . 

The primary mechanism for achieving the goals given above is the [[Common Effective Preferential Tariff]] (CEPT) scheme, which established a schedule for phased initiated in 1992 with the self-described goal to increase the "''region’s competitive advantage as a production base geared for the world market''".  . 

==History== . 

==The Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme==. 
Unlike the EU, AFTA does not apply a [[common external tariff]] on imported goods.  Each ASEAN member may impose tariffs on goods entering from outside ASEAN based on its national schedules.  However, for goods originating within ASEAN, ASEAN members are to apply a tariff rate of 0 to 5 percent (the more recent members of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam, also known as CMLV countries, were given additional time to implement the reduced tariff rates).  This is known as the Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme.  . 

ASEAN members have the option of excluding products from the CEPT in three cases: 1.) Temporary exclusions; 2.) Sensitive agricultural products; 3.) General exceptions. 
Temporary exclusions refer to products for which tariffs will ultimately be lowered to 0-5%, but which are being protected temporarily by a delay in tariff reductions.  . 

Sensitive agricultural products include commodities such as rice.  ASEAN members have until 2010 to reduce the tariff levels to 0-5%.  . 

General exceptions refer to products which an ASEAN member deems necessary for the protection of national security, public morals, the protection of human, animal or plant life and health, and protection of articles of artistic, historic, or archaeological value. 
ASEAN members have agreed to enact zero tariff rates on virtually all imports by 2010 for the original signatories, and 2015 for the CMLV countries.  . 

==Rule of Origin==. 
The CEPT only applies to goods originating within ASEAN.  The general rule is that local ASEAN content must be at least 40% of the FOB value of the good. The local ASEAN content can be cumulative, that is, the value of inputs from various ASEAN members can be combined to meet the 40% requirement.  The following formula is applied: . 

 Raw material cost
 + Direct labor cost
 + Direct overhead cost
 + Profit
 + Inland transport cost x 100%
 FOB value . 

However, for certain products, special rules apply:
* Change in Chapter Rule for Wheat Flour;
* Change of Tariff Sub-Heading for Wood-Based Products;
* Change in Tariff Classification for Certain Aluminum and Articles thereof. 
The exporter must obtain a “Form D” certification from its national government attesting that the good has met the 40% requirement.  The Form D must presented to the customs authority of the importing government to qualify for the CEPT rate.  Difficulties have sometimes arisen regarding the evidentiary proof to support the claim, as well how ASEAN national customs authorities can verify Form D submissions.  These difficulties arise because each ASEAN national customs authority interprets and implements the Form D requirements without much coordination.  . 

==Administration==. 
Administration of AFTA is handled by the national customs and trade authorities in each ASEAN member.  The ASEAN Secretariat has authority to monitor and ensure compliance with AFTA measures, but has no legal authority to enforce compliance.  This has led to inconsistent rulings by ASEAN national authorities.  The ASEAN Charter is intended to bolster the ASEAN Secretariat’s ability to ensure consistent application of AFTA measures.  . 

ASEAN national authorities have also been traditionally reluctant to share or cede sovereignty to authorities from other ASEAN members (although ASEAN trade ministries routinely make cross-border visits to conduct on-site inspections in anti-dumping investigations).  Unlike the EU or NAFTA, joint teams to ensure compliance and investigate non-compliance have not been widely used.  Instead, ASEAN national authorities must rely on the review and analysis of other ASEAN national authorities to determine if AFTA measures such as rule of origin are being followed.  Disagreements may result between the national authorities. Again, the ASEAN Secretariat may help mediate a dispute but has no legal authority to resolve it.  . 

ASEAN has attempted to improve customs coordination through the implementation of the ASEAN Single Window project.  The ASEAN Single Window would allow importers to submit all information related to the transaction to be entered electronically once. This information would then be shared with all other ASEAN national customs authorities.  . 

==Dispute resolution==. 
Although these ASEAN national customs and trade authorities coordinate among themselves, disputes can arise.  The ASEAN Secretariat has no legal authority to resolve such disputes, so disputes are resolved bilaterally through informal means or through dispute resolution.  . 

An ASEAN Protocol on Enhanced Dispute Settlement Mechanism governs formal dispute resolution in AFTA and other aspects of ASEAN.  ASEAN members may seek mediation and good offices consultations.  If these efforts are ineffective, they may ask SEOM (Senior Economic Officials Meetings) to establish panel of independent arbitrators to review the dispute.  Panel decisions can be appealed to an appellate body formed by the ASEAN Economic Community Council.  . 

The Protocol has almost never been invoked because of the role of SEOM in the dispute resolution process.  SEOM decisions require consensus among all ASEAN members, and since both the aggrieved party and the alleged transgressor are both participating in SEOM, such consensus cannot be achieved.  This discourages ASEAN members from invoking the Protocol, and often they seek dispute resolution in other fora such as the WTO or even the International Court of Justice.  This can also be frustrating for companies affected by an AFTA dispute, as they have no rights to invoke dispute resolution yet their home ASEAN government may not be willing to invoke the Protocol.  The ASEAN Secretary General has listed dispute resolution as requiring necessary reform for proper administration of AFTA and the AEC.  . 

==Further trade facilitation efforts==. 
Efforts to close the development gap and expand trade among members of ASEAN are key points of policy discussion.  According to a 2008 research brief published by the [[World Bank]] as part of its Trade Costs and Facilitation Project,<ref>[http://econ.worldbank.org/external/default/main?menuPK=1697684&pagePK=64168176&piPK=64168140&theSitePK=1697658  World Bank]</ref> ASEAN members have the potential to reap significant benefits from investments in further trade facilitation reform, due to the comprehensive tariff reform already realised through the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement.  . 

This new analysis suggests examining two key areas, among others: port facilities and competitiveness in the Internet services sector. Reform in these areas, the report states, could expand ASEAN trade by up to 7.5 percent ($22 billion) and 5.7 percent ($17 billion), respectively. By contrast, cutting applied tariffs in all ASEAN members to the regional average in Southeast Asia would increase intra-regional trade by about 2 percent ($6.3 billion). <ref>[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTTRADECOSTANDFACILITATION/Resources/Deeper_Integration_ASEAN_Issue_Brief_Jul08.pdf?resourceurlname=Deeper_Integration_ASEAN_Issue_Brief_Jul08.pdf "Deeper Integration in ASEAN: Why Transport and Technology Matter for Trade,"] [[John S.

==ASEAN Plus Three==. 
{{See also|Asian Monetary Unit}}
[[File:ASEAN Plus Three members.png|thumb|200px|Members of the ASEAN Plus Three]] . 

[[ASEAN]] Plus Three (APT) is a forum that functions as a coordinator of cooperation between the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] and the three [[East Asia]]n nations of [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Japan]], and [[South Korea]].  . 

The first leaders' meeting was held in 1997 and the group's significance and importance was strengthened by the [[Asian Financial Crisis]].  The grouping was institutionalised by 1999. <ref>[http://www.aseansec.org/16580.htm ASEAN Plus Three Cooperation]</ref> . 

ASEAN Plus Three, in establishing the [[Chiang Mai Initiative]], has been credited as forming the basis for financial stability in Asia,<ref>[http://www.aseansec.org/17902.pdf Chiang Mai Initiative as the Foundation of Financial Stability in East Asia]</ref> the lack of such stability being a contributing factor to the Asian Financial Crisis. The [[Asian Currency Unit]] (ACU) is a proposed weighted index of currencies for ASEAN+3. The ACU was inspired by the now defunct [[European Currency Unit]], replaced by the [[Euro]]. The Asian Currency Unit's purpose is to help stabilize the region's financial markets. The ACU as it is proposed is a currency basket and not a real currency, i.e., a weighted index of East Asian currencies that will function as a benchmark for regional currency movements. <ref>[http://www.takungpao.com.hk/news/05/11/07/EF-481029.htm A news report of the ACU] {{zh icon}}</ref><ref>[http://hiram7.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/workingpaper.pdf A paper analysing a broader basket of currencies]</ref> . 

The [[Asian Development Bank]] is currently reviewing different options concerning the technical aspects related to the ACU calculation, including the nature of the basket, the choice of fixed weights vs. fixed units, the selection of currencies to be included in the basket, the choice of weights, the criteria for their periodical revision, and other aspects as well. The Asian Development Bank was to announce the details of the ACU in March 2006 or later. <ref>[http://www.vneconomy.com.vn/eng/index.php?param=article&catid=01&id=43b1548514650f Interview with Asian Development Bank representative 24 February 2006]</ref>  However external pressures delayed this announcement although the concept was still being studied in detail. <ref>[http://www.adb.org/AnnualMeeting/2006/EmergingMarkets/em0503-03.asp ADB website: Boost for new monetary scheme - ASEAN+3 finance ministers to back Asian Currency Unit plan]</ref>  A panel discussion in February 2007 cited technical and political obstacles as having prevented the project from advancing. <ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nb20070222d1.html The Japan Times - Japan, South Korea can pull Asia together]</ref>  The unit, limited to [[ASEAN+3]], was said to be still moving forward by mid-July 2007. <ref>[http://business.inquirer.net/money/breakingnews/view_article.php?article_id=71800 The Inquirer (Philippines) - Asian currency unit shaping up]</ref> .
