A '''[[dam]]''' is a barrier across flowing water that obstructs, directs or slows down the flow, often creating a [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]], [[lake]] or impoundments. Most dams have a section called a ''[[spillway]] or [[weir]]'' over which, or through which, water flows, either intermittently or continuously, and some have [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power generation]] systems installed.  . 

Dams are considered "installations containing dangerous forces" under [[International Humanitarian Law]] due to the massive impact of a possible destruction on the civilian population and the environment. Dam failures are comparatively rare, but can cause immense damage and loss of life when they occur.   In 1975 the failure of the [[Banqiao Dam|Banqiao Reservoir Dam]] and other dams in [[Henan Province]],  [[China]] caused more casualties than any other dam failure in history.  The disaster killed an estimated 171,000 people<ref>Osnos, Evan. “Faust, China, and Nuclear Power,” ''The New Yorker'', Wednesday October 12, 2011. Retrieved at  http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/evanosnos/2011/10/faust-china-and-nuclear-power.html on October 12, 2011</ref> and 11 million people lost their homes.  . 

==Main causes of dam failure==. 
[[Image:International special sign for works and installations containing dangerous forces.svg|thumb|160px|right|International special sign for works and installations containing dangerous forces]] . 

Common causes of dam failure include:
:* Sub-standard construction materials/techniques ([[Gleno Dam]])
:* [[Spillway]] design error ([[South Fork Dam]], near failure of [[Glen Canyon Dam]])
:* Geological instability caused by changes to water levels during filling or poor surveying ([[Malpasset]]). 
:* Sliding of a mountain into the reservoir ([[Vaiont Dam]] – not exactly a dam failure, but caused nearly the entire volume of said reservoir to be displaced and overtop the dam)
:* Poor maintenance, especially of outlet pipes ([[Lawn Lake Dam]], [[Val di Stava Dam collapse]])
:* Extreme inflow ([[Shakidor Dam]])
:* Human, computer or design error ([[Buffalo Creek Flood]], [[Dale Dike Reservoir]], [[Taum Sauk pumped storage plant]])
:* [[Internal erosion]], especially in earthen dams. 
:* Earthquake
===Deliberate dam failure===. 
A notable case of deliberate dam failure (prior to the Humanitarian Law rulings) was the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Air Force]] [[Operation Chastise|Dambusters]] raid on [[Germany]] in [[World War II]] (codenamed ''"[[Operation Chastise]]"''), in which three German dams were selected to be breached in order to impact on German infrastructure and manufacturing and power capabilities deriving from the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] and [[Eder]] rivers. This raid later became the basis for several films.  .
