'''Hydropower''', '''hydrokinetic power''' or '''water power''' is [[power (physics)|power]] that is derived from the [[force]] or [[energy]] of falling water, which may be harnessed for useful purposes.  Since ancient times, hydropower has been used for [[irrigation]] and the operation of various mechanical devices, such as [[watermill]]s, [[sawmill]]s, [[textile]] mills, dock [[crane (machine)|crane]]s, and domestic [[elevator|lifts]]. Since the early 20th century, the term is used almost exclusively in conjunction with the modern development of [[hydroelectricity|hydro-electric power]], the energy of which could be transmitted considerable distance between where it was created to where it was consumed.  . 

Another previous method used to transmit energy had employed a [[trompe]], which produces compressed air from falling water, that could then be piped to power other machinery at a distance from the energy source.  . 

Water's power is manifested in [[hydrology]], by the forces of water on the [[riverbed]] and banks of a river.  When a river is in flood, it is at its most powerful, and moves the greatest amount of [[sediment]]. This higher force results in the removal of sediment and other material from the riverbed and banks of the river, locally causing [[erosion]], transport and, with lower flow, [[sedimentation]] downstream.  . 

== History ==. 
Early uses of waterpower date back to [[Mesopotamia]] and [[ancient Egypt]], where [[irrigation]] has been used since the 6th millennium BC and [[water clock]]s had been used since the early 2nd millennium BC. Other early examples of water power include the [[Qanat]] system in ancient Persia and the [[Turpan water system]] in ancient China. 
=== Waterwheels, turbines, and mills ===. 
Hydropower has been used for hundreds of years. In [[History of India|India]], [[water wheel]]s and [[watermill]]s were built; in [[Roman Empire|Imperial Rome]], water powered mills produced flour from grain, and were also used for sawing timber and stone; in China, watermills were widely used since the [[Han Dynasty]].  The power of a wave of water released from a tank was used for extraction of metal ores in a method known as [[hushing]]. The method was first used at the [[Dolaucothi]] [[gold mine]] in [[Wales]] from 75 AD onwards, but had been developed in [[Spain]] at such mines as [[Las Medulas]]. Hushing was also widely used in [[Great Britain|Britain]] in the [[Medieval]] and later periods to extract [[lead]] and [[tin]] ores. It later evolved into [[hydraulic mining]] when used during the [[California gold rush]].  . 

In [[China]] and the rest of the Far East, hydraulically operated "pot wheel" pumps raised water into irrigation canals. 
At the beginning of the [[Industrial revolution]] in Britain, water was the main source of power for new inventions such as [[Richard Arkwright]]'s [[water frame]]. <ref name="kreis">{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/lecture17a.html|title=The Origins of the Industrial Revolution in England|last=Kreis|first=Steven|year=2001|work=The history guide|accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref> Although the use of water power gave way to steam power in many of the larger mills and factories, it was still used during the 18th and 19th centuries for many smaller operations, such as driving the bellows in small [[blast furnace]]s (e.g. the [[Dyfi Furnace]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/mid/sites/history/pages/dyfifurnace.shtml|title=Dyfi Furnace|last=Gwynn|first=Osian|work=BBC Mid Wales History|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref> and [[gristmills]], such as those built at [[Saint Anthony Falls]], which uses the 50-foot (15&nbsp;m) drop in the [[Mississippi River]].  . 

In the 1830s, at the early peak in U.S. [[canal]]-building, hydropower provided the energy to transport [[barge]] traffic up and down steep hills using [[inclined plane railroad]]s.  About the same time and later, as railroads overtook canals for transportation, canal systems were modified and developed into hydropower systems; the [[history of Lowell, Massachusetts]] is a classic example of commercial development and industrialization, built upon the availability of water power.   . 

During this time also, technological advances had moved the water wheel to a turbine, and in 1848 [[James B. Francis]], while working as head engineer of  Lowell's Locks and Canals company, improved on these designs to create a turbine with 90% efficiency. Applying scientific principles and testing methods he produced a very efficient turbine design, but more importantly, his mathematical and graphical calculation methods improved turbine design and engineering. His analytical methods allowed confident design of high efficiency turbines to exactly match a site's specific flow conditions.  The [[Francis turbine|Francis reaction turbine]] is still in wide usage today, with few changes in either design or methods.   In the 1870s and deriving from uses in the California mining industry, [[Lester Allan Pelton]] developed the high efficiency [[Pelton wheel|Pelton wheel impulse turbine]], which utilized hydropower with very different conditions of flow and pressure.  . 

=== Hydraulic power-pipe networks ===. 
[[Hydraulic power network]]s also developed, using pipes to carrying pressurized water and transmit mechanical power from the source to end users elsewhere locally; the power source was normally a head of water, which could also be assisted by a pump. These were extensive in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] cities in the [[United Kingdom]]. A hydraulic power network was also developed in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. The world famous [[Jet d'Eau]] was originally designed as the over-pressure relief valve for the network. <ref name=geneva>[http://www.geneve-tourisme.ch/?rubrique=0000000172 Jet d'eau (water foutain)] on [http://www.geneve-tourisme.ch Geneva Tourism]</ref> . 

=== Compressed air hydro ===. 
Where there is a plentiful head of water it can be made to generate [[compressed air]] directly without moving parts. In these designs, a falling column of water is purposely mixed with air bubbles generated through turbulence at the high level intake. This is allowed to fall down a shaft into a subterranean, high-roofed chamber where the now-compressed air separates from the water and becomes trapped. The height of falling water column maintains compression of the air in the top of the chamber, while an outlet, submerged below the water level in the chamber allows water to flow back to the surface at a slightly lower level than the intake. A separate outlet in the roof of the chamber supplies the compressed air to the surface. A facility on this principal was built on the [[Montreal River (Timiskaming District)|Montreal River]] at Ragged Shutes near [[Cobalt, Ontario]] in 1910 and supplied 5,000 horsepower to nearby mines. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Maynard|first=Frank|date=November 1910|title=Five thousand horsepower from air bubbles|journal=Popular Mechanics|pages=Page 633|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-N0DAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> . 

== Modern usage ==. 
There are several mature forms of water power currently in wide usage, and other forms which are still in phases of development. Most hydropower is used primarily to generate [[electricity]], but some are purely mechanical.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Broad categories include: . 

=== Riverine hydropower ===. 
[[File:Hydroelectric dam.svg|thumb|200px|right|A [[Hydroelectricity#Generating methods|conventional]] dammed-hydro facility (hydroelectric dam) is the most common type of hydroelectric power generation.]]

* [[Hydroelectricity#Generating methods|Conventional hydroelectric]], referring to hydroelectric dams. 
* [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity]], which captures the kinetic energy in rivers or streams, without the use of dams. 
* [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity]], to pump up water, and use its [[Head (hydraulic)|head]] to generate in times of demand.  . 

=== Marine energy ===. 
[[File:Pelamis at EMEC.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A [[Pelamis Wave Energy Converter|Pelamis]] wave device under test at the [[European Marine Energy Centre]] (EMEC), Orkney, Scotland.]] 
{{Main|Marine energy}}

* [[Osmotic power]], which channels river water into a container separated from sea water by a semi-permeable membrane. 
* [[Ocean thermal energy]], which exploits the temperature difference between deep and shallow waters. 
* [[Tidal power]], which captures energy from the tides in horizontal direction. Also a popular form of [[Hydroelectricity#Generating methods|hydroelectric]] power generation. 
** [[Tidal stream power]], usage of stream generators, somewhat similar to that of a [[wind turbine]]. 
** [[Tidal barrage power]], usage of a tidal dam. 
** [[Dynamic tidal power]], utilizing large areas to generate [[Head (hydraulic)|head]]. 
* [[Wave power]], the use ocean surface waves to generate power.  . 

== Calculating the amount of available power ==. 
A hydropower resource can be measured according to the amount of available [[Power (physics)|power]], or energy per unit time. In large reservoirs, the available power is generally only a function of the hydraulic [[head (hydraulic)|head]] and [[rate of fluid flow]]. In a reservoir, the head is the height of water in the reservoir relative to its height after discharge. Each unit of water can do an amount of work equal to its weight times the head.  . 

In the English unit of measurement, an acre-foot of water at one foot of head will theoretically yield 1.0241 kilo-watt hours of power. Hydro-electric power plants will record their output of kilo-watt hours to the amount of water passed through their turbines, and compare it to this theoretically perfect output, to determine their efficiency. The calculation will also require the average difference in the forebay and tailbay, known as Average Static Head, for the time period being analyzed.  . 

Efficiency = Gross Plant Generation (KWH) / (Acre-Feet through Turbines x Average Static Head x 1.0241) . 

This formula for hydro-electric plant efficiency is actually a derivation of a formula used to estimate the cost to pump water, which is very important to those in agriculture, irrigation, water delivery, as well as wastewater and water treatment facilities. That formula is: . 

kWh/AF = (1.0241 x Total Dynamic Head) / Overall Pumping Efficiency . 

The efficiency of the hydroelectric plant may be further modified by using a constant that is unique to the reservoir. This constant will take into consideration the location of the plant, how the weight of a cubic foot of water is affected by the latitude of the plant site, the temperature and barometric pressure of the air, the density and purity of the water at ambient temperature, and the altitudes above sea level of the forebay and tailbay. Although these factors are very small quantities, with the large amounts of water that pass through large hydro-electric plants, they must be considered.  . 

Power (MW) = Average Static Head (ft) x 62.4 lbs/ft3 (specific weight of water at 39F) x efficiency factor (dimensionless) x Turbine Discharge (cubic-feet per second) / (1000 x 737.5) . 

The horsepower-to-kilowatt conversion factor (737.5) will exchange kilo-watts for ft-lbs/sec, and multiplying by 1000 will convert kilo-watts to mega-watts.  . 

The metric system requires fewer unit conversions. The amount of energy, ''E'', released when an object of mass ''m'' drops a height ''h'' in a gravitational field of strength ''g''<ref>[[Standard gravity]] is 9.80665&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup></ref> is given by . 

:<math>\, E = mgh</math> . 

The energy available to [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] dams is the energy that can be liberated by lowering water in a controlled way. In these situations, the power is related to the [[mass flow rate]].  . 

:<math>\frac{E}{t} = \frac{m}{t}gh</math> . 

Substituting ''P'' for {{frac|''E''|''t''}} and expressing {{frac|''m''|''t''}} in terms of the volume of liquid moved per unit time (the [[rate of fluid flow]] <math>\phi\,\,</math> ) and the density of water (<math>\rho\,\,</math>), we arrive at the usual form of this expression: . 

:<math>P = \rho\, \phi\, g \, h</math> . 

or . 

A simple formula for approximating electric power production at a hydroelectric plant is: . 

:<math>\,P = hrgk</math> . 

where P is Power in kilowatts, h is height in meters, r is flow rate in cubic meters per second, g is acceleration due to gravity of 9.8 m/s2, and k is a coefficient of efficiency ranging from 0 to 1. Efficiency is often higher with larger and more modern turbines. <ref>Donald G. Fink and H. Wayne Beaty, ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers, Eleventh Edition'', McGraw-Hill, New York, 1978, ISBN 0-07020974-X pp. 9-3 and 9-4</ref> . 

As an example, if you were to calculate the energy being produced by a single turbine that is 85% efficient, with a static head of 480 ft (146.304 m), and a flowrate of 2800 cubic-feet/second (79.28718 cubic-meters/second, or 79,287.18 kg/sec), you would do so as follows: . 

Metric Energy calculation = 9.8 m/sec2 x 146.304 m x 79,287.18 kg/sec x 0.85 = 96,628 KW or 96.63 MW . 

Note: 1 joule = kg-meter2/sec2, 1 joule/sec = watt . 

English Unit calculation = (480 ft x 62.4 lbs/ft3 x 2800 ft3/sec x 0.85) / 737.5 (converts horsepower-to-kilowatts) = 96,659 KW or 96.66 MW . 

The difference can be attributed to conversion rounding errors.  . 

Some hydropower systems such as [[water wheel]]s can draw power from the flow of a body of water without necessarily changing its height. In this case, the available power is the [[kinetic energy]] of the flowing water.  . 

:<math>P = \frac{1}{2}\,\rho\,\phi\, v^2</math> . 

where ''v'' is the speed of the water, or with . 

:<math> \phi = A\, v</math> . 

where ''A'' is the [[area]] through which the water passes, also . 

:<math>P = \frac{1}{2}\,\rho\, A\, v^3</math> . 

Over-shot water wheels can efficiently capture both types of energy .
