{{Renewable energy sources}}
'''Renewable energy''' is [[energy]] which comes from [[natural resource]]s such as [[sunlight]], [[wind]], [[rain]], [[tidal energy|tides]], and [[geothermal energy|geothermal heat]], which are [[Renewable resource|renewable]] (naturally replenished). About 16% of global final energy consumption comes from renewables, with 10% coming from traditional [[biomass]], which is mainly used for [[heating]], and 3.4% from [[hydroelectricity]]. New renewables (small hydro, modern biomass, wind, solar, geothermal, and biofuels) accounted for another 3% and are growing very rapidly. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |title=Renewables 2011: Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |year=2011 |page=17 }}</ref> The share of renewables in [[electricity generation]] is around 19%, with 16% of global electricity coming from hydroelectricity and 3% from new renewables. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |title=Renewables 2011: Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |year=2011 |page=18 }}</ref> .

==Overview==. 
[[file:GlobalREPowerCapacity-exHydro-Eng.png|thumb|300px|Global renewable power capacity excluding hydro<ref name="REN21_GSRs">{{cite web|url=http://www.ren21.net/REN21Activities/Publications/GlobalStatusReport/tabid/5434/Default.aspx |title=REN21, Renewables Global Status Report (2006 - 2011) |publisher=Ren21.net |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}</ref>]] . 

Renewable energy flows involve natural phenomena such as [[sunlight]], [[wind]], [[tide]]s, [[Biomass|plant growth]], and [[Geothermal heating|geothermal heat]], as the [[International Energy Agency]] explains:<ref>IEA Renewable Energy Working Party (2002). ''Renewable Energy... into the mainstream'', p. 9. </ref>
{{quote|Renewable energy is derived from natural processes that are replenished constantly. In its various forms, it derives directly from the sun, or from heat generated deep within the earth. Included in the definition is electricity and heat generated from solar, wind, ocean, hydropower, biomass, geothermal resources, and biofuels and hydrogen derived from renewable resources.}} . 

Renewable energy replaces conventional fuels in four distinct areas: [[electricity generation]], [[solar hot water|hot water]]/[[space heating]], [[motor fuel]]s, and rural (off-grid) energy services:<ref name=ren15>[[REN21]] (2010). [http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/REN21_GSR_2010_full_revised%20Sept2010.pdf Renewables 2010 Global Status Report] p. 15. </ref> . 

*'''Power generation'''. Renewable energy provides 19% of electricity generation worldwide. Renewable power generators are spread across many countries, and wind power alone already provides a significant share of electricity in some areas: for example, 14% in the U.S. state of Iowa, 40% in the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein, and 20% in Denmark. Some countries get most of their power from renewables, including Iceland and Paraguay (100%), Norway (98%), Brazil (86%), Austria (62%), New Zealand (65%), and Sweden (54%). <ref name=ren53>[[REN21]] (2010). [http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/REN21_GSR_2010_full_revised%20Sept2010.pdf Renewables 2010 Global Status Report] p. 53. </ref> . 

*'''Heating'''. [[Solar hot water]] makes an important contribution to [[renewable heat]] in many countries, most notably in China, which now has 70% of the global total (180 GWth). Most of these systems are installed on multi-family apartment buildings and meet a portion of the hot water needs of an estimated 50–60 million households in China. Worldwide, total installed [[solar water heating]] systems meet a portion of the water heating needs of over 70 million households. The use of biomass for heating continues to grow as well. In Sweden, national use of biomass energy has surpassed that of oil. Direct geothermal for heating is also growing rapidly. <ref name=ren53/> . 

*'''Transport fuels'''. Renewable [[biofuel]]s have contributed to a significant decline in oil consumption in the United States since 2006. The 93 billion liters of biofuels produced worldwide in 2009 displaced the equivalent of an estimated 68 billion liters of gasoline, equal to about 5% of world gasoline production. <ref name=ren53/> .

<!-- This section is for a basic description of the main renewable energy technologies. New and emerging technologies should be added to the section with that name towards the end of the article. Pros and cons of different technologies are discussed in [[Renewable energy debate]]. Thanks. --> . 

===Wind power===. 
{{Main|Wind power}} . 

[[File:Manjeel windmills.jpg|thumb|A [[wind farm]] located in [[Manjil]], [[Iran]].]]Airflows can be used to run [[wind turbine]]s.  Modern wind turbines range from around 600&nbsp;kW to 5 MW of rated power, although turbines with rated output of 1.5–3 MW have become the most common for commercial use; the power output of a turbine is a function of the cube of the wind speed, so as wind speed increases, power output increases dramatically. <ref name="EWEA">{{cite web | title = Analysis of Wind Energy in the EU-25 | publisher = European Wind Energy Association | url = http://www.ewea.org/fileadmin/ewea_documents/documents/publications/WETF/Facts_Summary.pdf EWEA Executive summary |format= PDF | accessdate = 2007-03-11}}</ref>  Areas where winds are stronger and more constant, such as offshore and high [[altitude]] sites, are preferred locations for wind farms. Typical [[capacity factor]]s are 20-40%, with values at the upper end of the range in particularly favourable sites. <ref>[http://www.awea.org/faq/basicen.html How Does A Wind Turbine's Energy Production Differ from Its Power Production?]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ceere.org/rerl/about_wind/RERL_Fact_Sheet_2a_Capacity_Factor.pdf Wind Power: Capacity Factor, Intermittency, and what happens when the wind doesn’t blow?]. Retrieved 24 January 2008. </ref> . 

Globally, the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production, or 40 times current electricity demand.  This could require wind turbines to be installed over large areas, particularly in areas of higher wind resources.  Offshore resources experience average wind speeds of ~90% greater than that of land, so offshore resources could contribute substantially more energy. <ref>"<cite>Offshore stations experience mean wind speeds at 80 m that are 90% greater than over land on average. </cite> [http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/winds/global_winds.html Evaluation of global wind power]<br />"<cite>Overall, the researchers calculated winds at 80 meters [300 feet] traveled over the ocean at approximately 8.6 meters per second and at nearly 4.5 meters per second over land [20 and 10 miles per hour, respectively]. </cite>" [http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/may2005/2005-05-17-09.asp#anchor6 Global Wind Map Shows Best Wind Farm Locations] .

===Hydropower===. 
{{See also|Hydroelectricity|Hydropower|}}
[[File:Grand Coulee Dam.jpg|thumb|[[Grand Coulee Dam]] is a [[hydroelectric]] [[gravity dam]] on the [[Columbia River]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The dam supplies four power stations with an installed capacity of 6,809 MW and is the largest [[electric power]]-producing facility in the United States.]] . 

Energy in water can be harnessed and used. Since water is about 800 times [[Density of air|denser than air]], even a slow flowing stream of water, or moderate sea [[Swell (ocean)|swell]], can yield considerable amounts of energy. There are many forms of water energy:
* Hydroelectric energy is a term usually reserved for large-scale hydroelectric dams. Examples are the [[Grand Coulee Dam]] in Washington State and the [[Akosombo Dam]] in Ghana. 
* [[Micro hydro]] systems are hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to 100&nbsp;kW of power. They are often used in water rich areas as a [[remote-area power supply]] (RAPS). 
* [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity]] systems derive [[kinetic energy]] from rivers and oceans without using a dam.  . 

===Solar energy===. 
{{See also|Solar energy|Solar power|Solar thermal energy}}
[[File:Klassieren.jpg|thumb|upright|Monocrystalline [[solar cell]].]] . 

Solar energy is the energy derived from the [[sun]] through the form of [[solar radiation]]. Solar powered electrical generation relies on [[photovoltaics]] and [[heat engine]]s. A partial list of other solar applications includes space heating and cooling through [[solar architecture]], [[daylighting]], [[solar hot water]], [[solar cooking]], and high temperature process heat for industrial purposes.  . 

Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute solar energy. Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic panels and solar thermal collectors to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air.  . 

===Biomass===. 
[[Biomass]] (plant material) is a renewable energy source because the energy it contains comes from the sun. Through the process of [[photosynthesis]], plants capture the sun's energy. When the plants are burnt, they release the sun's energy they contain. In this way, biomass functions as a sort of natural battery for storing solar energy. As long as biomass is produced sustainably, with only as much used as is grown, the battery will last indefinitely. <ref name=ucsfs>Union of Concerned Scientists. [http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/clean_energy/how_biomass_energy_works_factsheet.pdf How Biomass Energy Works]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref> . 

In general there are two main approaches to using plants for energy production: growing plants specifically for energy use (known as first and third-generation biomass), and using the residues (known as second-generation biomass) from plants that are used for other things. See [[biobased economy]]. The best approaches vary from region to region according to climate, soils and geography. <ref name=ucsfs/> . 

===Biofuel===. 
{{Main|Biofuel}}
[[File:Sao Paulo ethanol pump 04 2008 74 zoom.jpg|thumb|[[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil]] has [[ethanol fuel|bioethanol]]  made from sugarcane available throughout the country. Shown  a typical [[Petrobras]] gas station at [[São Paulo]] with dual fuel service, marked A for [[ethanol fuel|alcohol (ethanol)]] and G for gasoline.]]
Biofuels include a wide range of fuels which are derived from [[biomass]]. The term covers [[Biofuels#Solid biofuels|solid biomass]], [[liquid fuels]] and various [[biogas]]es. <ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.apenergy.2009.04.036}}</ref> Liquid [[biofuel]]s include bioalcohols, such as bioethanol, and oils, such as [[biodiesel]]. Gaseous biofuels include [[biogas]], [[landfill gas]] and [[synthetic gas]].  . 

[[Bioethanol]] is an [[alcohol]] made by [[Ethanol fermentation|fermenting]] the sugar components of plant materials and it is made mostly from sugar and starch crops. With advanced technology being developed, cellulosic biomass, such as trees and grasses, are also used as feedstocks for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a [[gasoline]] additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the [[Ethanol fuel in the United States|USA]] and in [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil]].  . 

[[Biodiesel]] is made from [[vegetable oil]]s, [[animal fat]]s or recycled greases. Biodiesel can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from [[oil]]s or fats using [[transesterification]] and is the most common biofuel in Europe.  . 

Biofuels provided 2.7% of the world's transport [[fuel]] in 2010. <ref name=ren212011>{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |title=Renewables 2011: Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |year=2011 |pages=13–14 }}</ref> . 

===Geothermal energy===. 
{{Main|Geothermal energy}}
[[Image:NesjavellirPowerPlant edit2.jpg|thumb|Steam rising from the [[Nesjavellir Geothermal Power Station]] in [[Iceland]].]]
Geothermal energy is [[thermal energy]] generated and stored in the Earth. Thermal energy is the energy that determines the [[temperature]] of matter. Earth's geothermal energy originates from the original formation of the planet (20%) and from [[radioactive decay]] of minerals (80%). <ref>

}}</ref> The [[geothermal gradient]], which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface, drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of [[heat]] from the core to the surface. The adjective ''geothermal'' originates from the Greek roots ''geo'', meaning earth, and ''thermos'', meaning heat.  . 

The heat that is used for geothermal energy can be stored deep within the Earth, all the way down to Earth’s core – 4,000 miles down. At the core, temperatures may reach over 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Heat conducts from the core to surrounding rock. Extremely high temperature and pressure cause some rock to melt, which is commonly known as magma. Magma convects upward since it is lighter than the solid rock. This magma then heats rock and water in the crust, sometimes up to 700 degrees Fahrenheit <ref>{{cite web|last=Nemzer|first=J|title=Geothermal heating and cooling|url=http://www.geothermal.marin.org/}}</ref> . 

From [[hot springs]], geothermal energy has been used for bathing since [[Paleolithic]] times and for space heating since ancient Roman times, but it is now better known for [[electricity generation]].  .

During the five-years from the end of 2004 through 2009, worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10–60% annually for many technologies. For wind power and many other renewable technologies, growth accelerated in 2009 relative to the previous four years. <ref name=ren15/> More wind power capacity was added during 2009 than any other renewable technology. However, grid-connected PV increased the fastest of all renewables technologies, with a 60% annual average growth rate for the five-year period. <ref name="ren15"/> In 2010, renewable power consisted about a third of the newly built power generation capacities. <ref name="UNEP_GT_2011_Fig24"/> .

According to a 2011 projection by the International Energy Agency, solar power generators may produce most of the world’s electricity  within 50 years, dramatically reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases that harm the environment. Cedric Philibert, senior analyst in the renewable energy division at the IEA said: “Photovoltaic and solar-thermal plants may meet most of the world’s demand for electricity by 2060 -- and half of all energy needs -- with wind, hydropower and biomass plants supplying much of the remaining generation”. “Photovoltaic and concentrated solar power together can become the major source of electricity,” Philibert said. <ref name="Ben Sills"/> . 

===Economic trends===. 
All forms of energy are expensive, but as time progresses, renewable energy generally gets cheaper,<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-GreenBusiness/idUSTRE5AM2BE20091123 Renewable energy costs drop in '09 ] ''Reuters'', November 23, 2009. </ref><ref>Solar Power 50% Cheaper By Year End - Analysis ''Reuters'', November 24, 2009. </ref> while fossil fuels generally get more expensive. A 2011 IEA report said: "A portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming cost-competitive in an increasingly broad range of circumstances, in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support," and added that "cost reductions in critical technologies, such as wind and solar, are set to continue."<ref name=henning>{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/23/us-energy-iea-renewables-idUSTRE7AM0OV20111123 |title=Renewable energy becoming cost competitive, IEA says |author=Henning Gloystein |date=Nov 23, 2011  |work=Reuters }}</ref> . 

The [[International Solar Energy Society]] argues that renewable energy technologies and economics will continue to improve with time, and that they are "sufficiently advanced at present to allow for major penetrations of renewable energy into the mainstream energy and societal infrastructures".  .

The [[Three Gorges Dam]] in [[Hubei]], [[China]], has the world's largest instantaneous generating capacity (22,500 MW), with the [[Itaipu Dam]] in Brazil/Paraguay in second place (14,000 MW).  The giant [[Three Gorges Dam]] (22,500 MW when completed) is operated jointly with the much smaller [[Gezhouba Dam]] (3,115 MW). {{As of|2009}}, the total generating capacity of this two-dam complex is 21,515 MW. The whole project is planned to be completed in 2012, when the total generating capacity will be 25,615 MW. In 2008, this complex generated  97.9 TWh of electricity (80.8 TWh from the Three Gorges Dam and 17.1 TWh from the Gezhouba Dam), which is 3.4% more power in one year than the 94.7 TWh generated by Itaipu in 2008.  .

===Geothermal energy commercialization===. 
[[File:West Ford Flat Geothermal Cooling Tower.JPG|upright|thumb|The West Ford Flat power plant is one of 22 power plants at The Geysers.]]

Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly,<ref>William E. Glassley. [http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781420075700;jsessionid=u-hy70Ic43mELYWGgG-uww** Geothermal Energy: Renewable Energy and the Environment] CRC Press, 2010. </ref> but has historically been limited to areas near [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plate]] boundaries. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially for applications such as home heating, opening a potential for widespread exploitation. Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels. As a result, geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate [[global warming]] if widely deployed in place of fossil fuels.  . 

The International Geothermal Association (IGA) has reported that 10,715 MW of geothermal power in 24 countries is online, which is expected to generate 67,246 GWh of electricity in 2010. <ref name=gea2010/> This represents a 20% increase in geothermal power online capacity since 2005. IGA projects this will grow to 18,500 MW by 2015, due to the large number of projects presently under consideration, often in areas previously assumed to have little exploitable resource. <ref name=gea2010>Geothermal Energy Association.

===Developing country markets===. 
{{Main|Renewable energy in developing countries}}
[[File:Solar-Panel-Cooker-in-front-of-hut.jpg|thumb| [[Solar cooker]]s use sunlight as energy source for outdoor cooking.]] . 

Renewable energy can be particularly suitable for developing countries. In rural and remote areas, transmission and distribution of energy generated from [[fossil fuels]] can be difficult and expensive. Producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative. <ref name=aus>[http://www.ausaid.gov.au/publications/pdf/renewable_energy.pdf Power for the People] p. 3. </ref> . 

Technology advances are opening up a huge new market for solar power: the approximately 1.3 billion people around the world who don't have access to grid electricity. Even though they are typically very poor, these people have to pay far more for lighting than people in rich countries because they use inefficient kerosene lamps. Solar power costs half as much as lighting with kerosene. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/39544/?p1=MstCom |title=In the Developing World, Solar Is Cheaper than Fossil Fuels |author=Kevin Bullis |date=January 27, 2012 |work=Technology Review }}</ref> An estimated 3 million households get power from small solar PV systems. <ref name = re10>REN21 (2010).

More than 30,000 very small solar panels, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://rael.berkeley.edu/files/2006/Kammen-SciAm-Renewables-9-06.pdf |title=The Rise of Renewable Energy |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}</ref> . 

Micro-hydro configured into mini-grids also provide power. Over 44 million households use [[biogas]] made in household-scale digesters for [[lighting]] and/or [[cooking]], and more than 166 million households rely on a new generation of more-efficient biomass cookstoves. <ref name="REN21 2011 14"/> . 

Renewable energy projects in many developing countries have demonstrated that renewable energy can directly contribute to [[poverty alleviation]] by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment. Renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking, space heating, and lighting. Renewable energy can also contribute to education, by providing electricity to schools. <ref>[http://www.worldwatch.org/system/files/ren21-1.pdf Energy for Development: The Potential Role of Renewable Energy in Meeting the Millennium Development Goals] pp. 7-9. </ref> .

The military has also focused on the use of [[renewable fuels]] for military vehicles. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable fuels can be produced in any country, creating a strategic advantage. The US military has already committed itself to have 50% of its energy consumption come from alternative sources. <ref>{{cite web |url= http://nextnavy.com/air-force-cedes-the-green-lead-and-the-lede-to-navy/ |title=Air Force cedes the Green lead–and the lede–to Navy |first=Craig |last=Hooper |work=nextnavy.com |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=December 27, 2011}}</ref> . 

The [[International Renewable Energy Agency]] (IRENA) is an [[intergovernmental organization]] for promoting the [[renewable energy commercialization|adoption of renewable energy]] worldwide.  It aims to provide concrete policy advice and facilitate [[capacity building]] and technology transfer. IRENA was formed on January 26, 2009, by 75&nbsp;countries signing the charter of IRENA. <ref>[http://irena.org/downloads/Founconf/Signatory_States_20090126.pdf ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> As of March 2010, IRENA has 143&nbsp;member states who all are considered as founding members, of which 14 have also ratified the statute. <ref>[http://irena.org/downloads/Foundconf/Signatory_States_2010.pdf ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> . 

As of 2011, 119 countries have some form of national [[renewable energy policy]] target or renewable support policy. National targets now exist in at least 98 countries. There is also a wide range of policies at state/provincial and local levels. <ref name=ren212011/> . 

[[United Nations]]' Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity. <ref name="renewableenergyworld1"/> In October 2011, he "announced the creation of a high-level group to drum up support for energy access, energy efficiency and greater use of renewable energy. The group is to be co-chaired by Kandeh Yumkella, the chair of UN Energy and director general of the UN Industrial Development Organisation, and Charles Holliday, chairman of Bank of America". <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/nov/02/human-development-report-renewable-energy |title=UN calls for universal access to renewable energy |author=Mark Tran |date=2 November 2011 |work=The Guardian |location=London}}</ref> . 

==New and emerging renewable energy technologies==. 
New and emerging renewable energy technologies are still under development and include [[cellulosic ethanol]], [[hot-dry-rock]] geothermal power, and [[ocean energy]]. <ref name="IEA">International Energy Agency (2007). 
[http://www.iea.org/textbase/papers/2006/renewable_factsheet.pdf ''Renewables in global energy supply: An IEA facts sheet''] (PDF), OECD, p. 3. </ref> These technologies are not yet widely demonstrated or have limited commercialization. Many are on the horizon and may have potential comparable to other renewable energy technologies, but still depend on attracting sufficient attention and research, development and demonstration (RD&D) funding. <ref name="IEA" /> . 

===Cellulosic ethanol===. 
{{See also|Cellulosic ethanol commercialization}} . 

Companies such as [[Iogen Corporation|Iogen]], [[Broin]], and [[Abengoa]] are building refineries that can process biomass and turn it into ethanol, while companies such as the [[Verenium Corporation]], [[Novozymes]], and [[Dyadic International]] are producing enzymes which could enable a [[cellulosic ethanol]] future.  The shift from food crop feedstocks to waste residues and native grasses offers significant opportunities for a range of players, from farmers to biotechnology firms, and from project developers to investors. <ref>Pernick, Ron and Wilder, Clint (2007).

===Ocean energy===. 
Systems to harvest utility-scale electrical power from ocean waves have recently been gaining momentum as a viable technology. The potential for this technology is considered promising, especially on west-facing coasts with latitudes between 40 and 60 degrees:<ref name=je>Jeff Scruggs and Paul Jacob. Harvesting Ocean Wave Energy, ''Science'', Vol. 323, 27 February 2009, p. 1176. </ref> . 

In the United Kingdom, for example, the Carbon Trust recently estimated the extent of the economically viable offshore resource at 55 TWh per year, about 14% of current national demand. Across Europe, the technologically achievable resource has been estimated to be at least 280 TWh per year. In 2003, the U.S. Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) estimated the viable resource in the United States at 255 TWh per year (6% of demand). <ref name=je/> . 

Scotland is home to the [[European Marine Energy Centre]] the world's first testing facility for wave and tidal machines, located in the waters around the [[Orkney]] Islands. In 2012 at the wave test site, [[E.ON]] are testing a [[Pelamis Wave Energy Converter]] machine and [[Aquamarine Power]] are testing their near-shore Oyster device. Wave farm developments are planned in Scottish waters by [[E.ON]], ScottishPower Renewables, [[SSE plc|SSE]], [[Pelamis Wave Power]], [[Aquamarine Power]] and Aegir Wave Power, a joint venture between Pelamis and [[Vattenfall]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/estates-map/map?lat=57.75569&long=-4.08237&zoom=6&isScotland=true|title=The Crown Estates Map|accessdate=2012-03-13}}</ref> . 

The world's first commercial [[tidal stream generator]] was installed in 2007 in the narrows of [[Strangford Lough]] in Ireland. The 1.2 MW underwater tidal electricity generator, part of Northern Ireland's Environment & Renewable Energy Fund scheme, takes advantage of the fast tidal flow (up to 4 metres per second) in the lough. Although the generator is powerful enough to power a thousand homes, the turbine has minimal environmental impact, as it is almost entirely submerged, and the rotors pose no danger to wildlife as they turn quite slowly. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6728073.stm World tidal energy first for NI, BBC News] ''BBC News'', 7 June 2007. </ref> . 

[[Ocean thermal energy conversion]] (OTEC) uses the temperature difference that exists between deep and shallow waters to run a heat engine.  . 

===Enhanced geothermal systems===. 
{{Main|Enhanced geothermal system}}

Enhanced geothermal systems are a new type of [[geothermal power]] technologies that do not require natural convective hydrothermal resources. The vast majority of geothermal energy within drilling reach is in dry and non-porous rock. <ref name="Duchane">{{Cite news | last1 = Duchane | first1 = Dave | last2 = Brown | first2 = Don | date =December 2002 | title =Hot Dry Rock (HDR) Geothermal Energy Research and Development at Fenton Hill, New Mexico | periodical =Geo-Heat Centre Quarterly Bulletin | publication-place =Klamath Falls, Oregon | publisher =Oregon Institute of Technology | volume =23 | issue =4 | pages = 13–19 | url =http://geoheat.oit.edu/bulletin/bull23-4/art4.pdf | issn =0276-1084 | accessdate =2009-05-05 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> EGS technologies "enhance" and/or create geothermal resources in this "hot dry rock (HDR)" through [[hydraulic fracturing|hydraulic stimulation]].  . 

EGS / HDR technologies, like hydrothermal geothermal, are expected to be baseload resources which produce power 24 hours a day like a fossil plant. Distinct from hydrothermal, HDR / EGS may be feasible anywhere in the world, depending on the economic limits of drill depth.  Good locations are over deep [[granite]] covered by a thick (3–5&nbsp;km) layer of insulating sediments which slow heat loss. <ref>[http://www.science.org.au/events/conferences-and-workshops/australiachina/raham.pdf 20 slide presentation inc geothermal maps of Australia]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> . 

There are HDR and EGS systems currently being developed and tested in [[France]], [[Australia]], [[Japan]], Germany, the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Switzerland]].  The largest EGS project in the world is a 25 megawatt demonstration plant currently being developed in the Cooper Basin, Australia.  The Cooper Basin has the potential to generate 5,000–10,000&nbsp;MW.  . 

===Experimental solar power===. 
[[File:Concentració Fotovoltaica.jpg|thumb|right|Concentrating photovoltaics in Catalonia, Spain]]
{{See also|Solar power#Experimental solar power}}
[[Concentrated photovoltaics]] (CPV) systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for the purpose of [[electricity generation]]. [[Thermogenerator|Thermoelectric]], or "thermovoltaic" devices convert a temperature difference between dissimilar materials into an electric current. [[Space-based solar power]] is a theoretical design for the collection of solar power in space, for use on Earth.  . 

===Artificial photosynthesis===. 
[[Artificial photosynthesis]] uses techniques include [[nanotechnology]] to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds by splitting water to produce hydrogen and then using carbon dioxide to make methanol. <ref>Collings AF and Critchley C (eds). Artificial Photosynthesis- From Basic Biology to Industrial Application (Wiley-VCH Weinheim 2005) p ix. </ref> . 

==Renewable energy debate==. 
{{Main|Renewable energy debate}}
Renewable electricity production, from sources such as wind power and solar power, is sometimes criticized for being variable or [[Intermittent power source|intermittent]]. However, the [[International Energy Agency]] has stated that deployment of renewable technologies usually increases the diversity of electricity sources and, through local generation, contributes to the flexibility of the system and its resistance to central shocks. <ref>[[International Energy Agency]] (2007). [http://www.iea.org/textbase/papers/2007/so_contribution.pdf Contribution of Renewables to Energy Security] IEA Information Paper, p. 5. </ref> . 

There have been "not in my back yard" ([[NIMBY]]) concerns relating to the visual and other impacts of some [[wind farm]]s, with local residents sometimes fighting or blocking construction. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/080114-wind-energy.html |title=Whatever Happened to Wind Energy? |publisher=LiveScience |date=2008-01-14 |accessdate=2011-11-21}}</ref> In the USA, the Massachusetts [[Cape Wind]] project was delayed for years partly because of aesthetic concerns. However, residents in other areas have been more positive and there are many examples of community wind farm developments. According to a town councilor, the overwhelming majority of locals believe that the [[Ardrossan Wind Farm]] in Scotland has enhanced the area. <ref name="guardian.co.uk">{{cite news|author=Simon Gourlay |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/12/windpower.alternativeenergy |title=Wind farms are not only beautiful, they're absolutely necessary |publisher=Guardian |date= 2008-08-12|accessdate=2011-11-21 |location=London}}</ref> . 

The market for renewable energy technologies has continued to grow. [[Climate change]] concerns, coupled with [[Oil price increases since 2003|high oil prices]], [[peak oil]], and increasing government support, are driving increasing renewable energy legislation, incentives and [[renewable energy commercialization|commercialization]]. <ref name="UNEP"/> New government spending, regulation and policies helped the industry weather the 2009 economic crisis better than many other sectors. <ref name="obama"/> .
