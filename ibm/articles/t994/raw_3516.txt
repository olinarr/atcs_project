'''Low-carbon power''' comes from processes or technologies that, at the point of generation, release less Carbon dioxide than the traditional means of [[power generation]]. It includes [[zero carbon]] power generation sources, such as [[wind power]], [[solar power]], [[geothermal power]] and (except for fuel preparation) [[nuclear power]], as well as sources with lower-level emissions such as [[natural gas]]. These power-generation techniques emit significantly less carbon dioxide than a traditional [[fossil fuel power plant]].  . 

== History ==. 
Over the past 30 years, significant findings regarding global warming highlighted the need to curb carbon emissions. From this, the idea for low carbon power was born. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), established by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) and the [[United Nations Environment Program]] (UNEP) in 1988, set the scientific precedence for the introduction of low carbon power. The IPCC has continued to provide scientific, technical and socio-economic advice to the world community, through its periodic assessment reports and special reports. <ref>[http://www.ipcc.ch/about/about.htm Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Web site]</ref> . 

Internationally, the most prominent early step in the direction of low carbon power was the signing of the [[Kyoto Protocol]], which came into force on February 16, 2005, under which most industrialized countries committed to reduce their carbon emissions. The historical event set the political precedence for introduction of low carbon power technology. <ref>[[Low-carbon economy]] Wikipedia Entry on “Carbon Economy”</ref> . 

On a social level, perhaps the biggest factor contributing to the general public’s awareness of climate change and the need for new technologies, including low carbon power, came from the documentary [[An Inconvenient Truth]], which clarified and highlighted the problem of global warming.  . 

== What is low carbon power? ==. 
=== Vattenfall study ===. 
[[Image:Greenhouse emissions by electricity source.PNG|300px|right|The Vattenfall study found nuclear, hydro, and wind to have far less greenhouse emissions than other sources represented.]] . 

The Swedish utility [[Vattenfall]] did a study of full life cycle emissions of nuclear, hydro, coal, gas, solar cell, peat and wind which the utility uses to produce electricity. The net result of the study was that nuclear power produced 3.3&nbsp;grams of carbon dioxide per kW-hr of produced power. This compares to 400 for [[natural gas]] and 700 for [[coal]] (according to this study). The study also concluded that nuclear power produced the smallest amount of CO<sub>2</sub> of any of their electricity sources. <ref>nuclearinfo.net. [http://nuclearinfo.net/Nuclearpower/WebHomeGreenhouseEmissionsOfNuclearPower Greenhouse Emissions of Nuclear Power]</ref> . 

===Sovacool life cycle study survey===. 
[[Image:Sovacool 2008 life-cycle study.png|thumb|right|Sovacool determined that the mean value of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for nuclear power over the life cycle of a plant was 66.08 g/kWh.]] . 

A 2008 [[meta analysis]], "Valuing the use Gas Emissions from Nuclear Power: A Critical Survey,"<ref>Benjamin K. Sovacool. [http://www.nirs.org/climate/background/sovacool_nuclear_ghg.pdf Valuing the greenhouse gas emissions from nuclear power: A critical survey] ''[[Energy Policy]]'', Vol. 36, 2008, pp. 2940-2953. </ref> by [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]], analysed 103 life cycle studies of greenhouse gas-equivalent emissions for nuclear power plants. The studies surveyed included the 1997 Vattenfall comparative emissions study, among others. Sovacool's analysis calculated that the mean value of emissions over the lifetime of a nuclear power plant is 66 g/kWh. Comparative results for [[wind power]], [[hydroelectricity]], [[solar thermal power]], and [[solar photovoltaic]], were 9-10 g/kWh, 10-13 g/kWh, 13 g/kWh and 32 g/kWh respectively. <ref>Benjamin K. Sovacool. [http://www.nirs.org/climate/background/sovacool_nuclear_ghg.pdf Valuing the greenhouse gas emissions from nuclear power: A critical survey]. ''[[Energy Policy]]'', Vol. 36, 2008, p. 2950. </ref> . 

=== Differentiating attributes ===. 
There are many options for lowering current levels of carbon emissions. Some options, such as wind power and solar power, produce no carbon emissions, using entirely renewable sources. Other options, such as nuclear power, produce no carbon emissions during operation, but come from non-renewable sources ([[uranium]]). The term low carbon power can also include power that continues to utilize the world’s natural resources, such as natural gas and coal, but employs techniques that reduce carbon emissions from these sources when burning them for fuel.  . 

As the single largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the United States, the electric-power industry accounted for 39% of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2004, a 27% increase since 1990. <ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0406/p03s03-sten.html The Christian Science Monitor; “New case for regulating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions”]</ref> Because the cost of reducing emissions in the electricity sector appears to be lower than in other sectors such as transportation, the electricity sector may deliver the largest proportional carbon reductions under an economically efficient climate policy. <ref name=issues>[http://www.issues.org/23.3/apt.html Issues in Science] & Technology Online; “Promoting Low-Carbon Electricity Production”]</ref> . 

Technologies to produce electric power with low-carbon emissions are already in use at various scales. Together, they account for roughly 28% of all U.S. electric-power production, with nuclear power representing the majority (20%), followed by hydroelectric power (7%). <ref name=issues /> However, demand for power is increasing, driven by increased population and per capita demand, and low carbon power can supplement the supply needed. <ref>[http://www.pewclimate.org/global-warming-in-depth/all_reports/electricity/ex__summary.cfm The Pew Center on Global Climate Change; “Global Warming in Depth”]</ref> . 

== Examples of low carbon technology ==. 
=== Natural gas and combined cycle gas turbines ===. 
While it may seem counter-intuitive that [[natural gas]] is a source of low carbon power, of all the fossil fuels used in power generation, it emits the least carbon dioxide. <ref>[http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/fossil_fuels/offmen-how-natural-gas-works.html Union of Concerned Scientists online; "How natural gas works"]</ref> . 

Through the [[combined cycle]] process, a [[gas turbine]] generator generates electricity and the waste heat from the gas turbine is used to make steam to generate additional electricity via a [[steam turbine]]; this last step enhances the efficiency of [[electricity generation]].  . 

=== Hydroelectric power ===. 
[[File:Hoovernewbridge.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Hoover Dam]] when completed in 1936 was both the world's largest electric-power generating station and the world's largest concrete structure.]] . 

[[Hydroelectric]] plants have the advantage of being long-lived and many existing plants have operated for more than 100 years. Hydropower is also an extremely flexible technology from the perspective of power grid operation. Large hydropower provides one of the lowest cost options in today’s energy market, even compared to fossil fuels and there are no harmful emissions associated with plant operation. <ref name="IEA">International Energy Agency (2007). 
[http://www.iea.org/textbase/papers/2006/renewable_factsheet.pdf ''Renewables in global energy supply: An IEA facts sheet''] (PDF), OECD, p. 3. </ref> . 

Hydroelectric power is currently the world’s largest installed renewable source of electricity, supplying about 17% of total electricity in 2005. <ref>[[Mark Z. Jacobson]] (2009). [http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/EnergyEnvRev1008.pdf Review of Solutions to Global Warming, Air Pollution, and Energy Security] p. 5. </ref> [[Three Gorges Dam|China]] is the world's largest producer of [[hydroelectricity]] in the world, followed by [[Hydroelectric power in Canada|Canada]].  . 

However, there are several significant social and environmental disadvantages of large-scale hydroelectric power systems: dislocation of people living where the reservoirs are planned, release of significant amounts of carbon dioxide and methane during construction and flooding of the reservoir, and disruption of aquatic ecosystems and birdlife. <ref>Duncan Graham-Rowe. [http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7046 Hydroelectric power's dirty secret revealed] ''New Scientist'', 24 February 2005. </ref> There is a strong consensus now that countries should adopt an integrated approach towards managing water resources, which would involve planning hydropower development in co-operation with other water-using sectors. <ref name="IEA"/> . 

=== Wind power ===.

As of September 2010, the [[Thanet Offshore Wind Project]] in [[United Kingdom]] is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 300 [[Megawatt|MW]], followed by [[Horns Rev|Horns Rev II]] (209 MW) in Denmark.  The [[Wind power in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] is the world's leading generator of offshore wind power, followed by Denmark. <ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/jan/08/wind-power Blown away]</ref> . 

=== Solar power ===. 
{{Main|Solar power}}
[[Image:PS10 solar power tower.jpg|thumb|right|The [[PS10 solar power tower|PS10]] concentrates sunlight from a field of heliostats on a central tower.]]
Solar power is the conversion of sunlight into [[electricity]], either directly using [[photovoltaics]] (PV), or indirectly using [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP). CSP systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. PV converts light into electric current using the [[photoelectric effect]].  . 

Commercial CSP plants were first developed in the 1980s, and the 354 MW [[SEGS]] CSP installation is the largest solar power plant in the world and is located in the Mojave Desert of California.  Other large CSP plants include the [[Solnova Solar Power Station]] (150 MW) and the [[Andasol solar power station]] (100 MW), both in Spain. The 97 MW [[Sarnia Photovoltaic Power Plant]] in [[Canada]], is the [[List of photovoltaic power stations|world’s largest]] [[photovoltaic plant]].  . 

=== Nuclear power ===. 
[[Nuclear power]]'s capability to add significantly to future low carbon power depends strongly on several factors, including new plant designs (see [[Nuclear reactor technology]]), national and regional politics, fuel availability (see [[Uranium depletion]]), etc.  . 

Nuclear power, with as of 2007 a 20% share of U.S. electricity production, is the largest deployed technology among current low-carbon energy sources. <ref name="issues"/> However, the over-one-hundred currently employed U.S. plants are ageing (see [[Plant life extension]]). Also, the [[Economics of new nuclear power plants]] are still evolving and plans to add to those plants are mostly in flux. <ref>[http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-reactors/col/new-reactor-map.html Location of Projected New Nuclear Power Reactors]</ref> Nuclear power's capability to add significantly to future low carbon power in the U.S. therefore remains uncertain.  . 

Nuclear power brings with it important [[High-level radioactive waste management|waste disposal]], [[nuclear safety|safety]], and [[nuclear terrorism|security]] risks which are unique among low-carbon energy sources. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nuclear_power/nuclear_subsidies_report.pdf |title=Nuclear Power:Still Not Viable without Subsidies |author=Koplow, Doug |date=February 2011 |publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists |page=1 }}</ref> [[Amory Lovins]] has said:
<blockquote>
Nuclear power is the only energy source where mishap or malice can kill so many people so far away; the only one whose ingredients can help make and hide nuclear bombs; the only climate solution that substitutes proliferation, accident, and high-level radioactive waste dangers. Indeed, nuclear plants are so slow and costly to build that they reduce and retard climate protection. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amory-lovins/nuclear-power-fukushima-_b_837643.html |title=With Nuclear Power, "No Acts of God Can Be Permitted" |author=Amory Lovins |date=March 18, 2011 |work=Huffington Post }}</ref>

=== Geothermal power ===. 
{{Main|Geothermal electricity}}
Geothermal electricity is [[electricity generation|electricity generated]] from [[geothermal energy]]. Technologies in use include dry steam power plants, flash steam power plants and binary cycle power plants. Geothermal electricity generation is currently used in 24 countries<ref name=gea2010>Geothermal Energy Association.

=== Tidal power ===. 
[[Tidal power]] is a form of [[hydropower]] that converts the energy of [[tide]]s into electricity or other useful forms of power. The first large-scale tidal power plant (the [[Rance Tidal Power Station]]) started operation in 1966. Although not yet widely used, tidal power has potential for future [[electricity generation]]. Tides are more predictable than [[wind energy]] and [[solar power]].  .

=== Emissions ===. 
[[Image:Greenhouse Gas by Sector.png|thumb| Greenhouse gas emissions by sector. See [http://cait.wri.org/figures.php?page=World-FlowChart&view=100 World Resources Institute] for detailed breakdown]]
The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] stated in its first working group report that “most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] greenhouse gas concentrations, contribute to [[climate change]]. <ref>[http://www.ipcc.ch/SPM2feb07.pdf Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.

Retrieved on 2007-02-02.]</ref> . 

As a percentage of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) accounts for 72 percent,<ref>[[Greenhouse gas]]</ref> and has increased in concentration in the atmosphere from 315 parts per million (ppm) in 1958 to more than 375 ppm in 2005. <ref>[http://cdiac.ornl.gov/trends/co2/graphics/mlo145e_thrudc04.pdf Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC), the primary climate-change data and information analysis center of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)]</ref> . 

Emissions from energy make up more than 61.4 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions. <ref name="wri">[http://www.wri.org/climate/topic_content.cfm?cid=4177 World Resources Institute; “Greenhouse Gases and Where They Come From”]</ref> Power generation from traditional coal fuel sources accounts for 18.8 percent of all world greenhouse gas emissions, nearly double that emitted by road transportation. <ref name="wri" /> . 

Estimates state that by 2020 the world will be producing around twice as much carbon emissions as it was in 2000. <ref>[http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/FTPROOT/presentations/ieo99_3im/sld006.htm Energy Information Administration; “World Carbon Emissions by Region”]</ref> . 

=== Electricity usage ===. 
[[Image:GHG by region.jpg|thumb|World CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by region]] . 

World energy consumption is predicted to increase from 421 quadrillion British Thermal Units (BTU) in 2003 to 722 quadrillion BTU in 2030. <ref>[http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/ieo/figure_7.html Energy Information Administration; “International Energy Outlook 2006”]</ref> Coal consumption is predicted to nearly double in that same time. <ref>[http://timeforchange.org/prediction-of-energy-consumption Time for Change,org; “Prediction of Energy Consumption World-Wide”]</ref> The fastest growth is seen in non-[[OECD]] Asian countries, especially China and India, where economic growth drives increased energy use. <ref>[http://www.eia.doe.gov/neic/press/images/06-03-1.gif Energy Information Administration; “World Market Energy Consumption by Region”]</ref> By implementing low carbon power options, world electricity demand could continue to grow while maintaining stable carbon emission levels.  . 

=== Energy infrastructure ===. 
[[Image:World Coal Resources.gif|thumb|2/3 of world coal capacity is yet to be built]] . 

By 2015, one-third of the 2007 U.S. coal plants will be more than 50 years old. <ref name="nrdc">[http://72.32.110.154/globalWarming/tdh0603.asp National Resources Defense Council Web site; "Hearing on Future Options for Generation of Electricity from Coal"]</ref> Nearly two-thirds of the generation capacity required to meet power demand in 2030 is yet to be built. <ref name="nrdc" /> There are currently 151 new coal-fired power plants planned for the U.S., providing 90GW of power. <ref name="netl">[http://www.netl.doe.gov/coal/refshelf/ncp.pdf The National Energy Technology Laboratory Web site “Tracking New Coal Fired Power Plants”]</ref> . 

=== Viability ===. 
Improvements to current carbon capture technologies could reduce CO<sub>2</sub> capture costs by at least 20-30% over approximately the next decade, while new technologies under development promise more substantial cost reduction. <ref name="netl" /> . 

=== Investment ===. 
Investment in low carbon power sources and technologies is increasing at a rapid rate. Zero-carbon power sources produce about 2% of the world's energy, but account for about 18% of world investment in power generation, attracting $100 billion of investment capital in 2006. <ref>[http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=512&ArticleID=5616&l=en United Nations Environment Program Global Trends in Sustainable Energy Investment 2007]</ref> .
