The net '''capacity factor''' of a [[power plant]] is the ratio of the actual output of a power plant over a period of time and its potential output if it had operated at full [[nameplate capacity]] the entire time. To calculate the capacity factor, take the total amount of [[energy]] the plant produced during a period of time and divide by the amount of energy the plant would have produced at full capacity. Capacity factors vary greatly depending on the type of [[fuel]] that is used and the design of the plant. The capacity factor should not be confused with the [[availability factor]], capacity credit (firm capacity) or with [[Betz' law|efficiency]].  . 

==Sample calculations==. 
===Baseload power plant===. 
A [[base load power plant]] with a capacity of 1,000 [[megawatt]]s (MW) might produce 648,000 [[megawatt-hour]]s (MW·h) in a 30-day month. The number of megawatt-hours that would have been produced had the plant been operating at full capacity can be determined by multiplying the plant's maximum capacity by the number of hours in the time period. 1,000&nbsp;MW ×&nbsp;30&nbsp;days ×&nbsp;24&nbsp;hours/day is 720,000&nbsp;MW·h. The capacity factor is determined by dividing the actual output with the maximum possible output. In this case, the capacity factor is 0.9 (90%). <ref>[http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/capacity-factor-net.html Glossary Capacity factor (net)]</ref> .

== Reasons for reduced capacity factor ==. 
{{Refimprove|date=December 2010}}
There are several reasons why a plant would have a capacity factor lower than 100%. The first reason is that it was out of service or operating at reduced output for part of the time due to equipment failures or routine maintenance. This accounts for most of the unused capacity of base load power plants. Base load plants have the lowest costs per unit of electricity because they are designed for maximum efficiency and are operated continuously at high output. [[Geothermal power|Geothermal plants]], [[nuclear power|nuclear plants]], [[fossil fuel power plant|coal plants]] and [[bioenergy|bioenergy plants]] that burn solid material are almost always operated as base load plants.  . 

The second reason that a plant would have a capacity factor lower than 100% is that output is curtailed because the electricity is not needed or because the price of electricity is too low to make production economical. This accounts for most of the unused capacity of [[peaking power plant]]s. Peaking plants may operate for only a few hours per year or up to several hours per day. Their electricity is relatively expensive. It is uneconomical, even wasteful, to make a peaking power plant as efficient as a base load plant because they do not operate enough to pay for the extra equipment cost, and perhaps not enough to offset the [[embodied energy]] of the additional components.  . 

A third reason is a variation on the second: the operators of a hydroelectric dam may [[Grid energy storage#Hydroelectric dam uprating|uprate its nameplate capacity]] by adding more generator units. Since the supply of fuel (i.e. water) remains unchanged, the uprated dam obtains a higher peak output in exchange for a lower capacity factor. Because hydro plants are highly dispatchable, they are able to act as [[load following power plant]]s. Having a higher peak capacity allows a dam's operators to sell more of the annual output of electricity during the hours of highest electricity demand (and thus the highest [[spot price]]). In practical terms, uprating a dam allows it to [[Load balancing (electrical power)|balance]] a larger amount of [[intermittent energy source]]s on the grid such as [[wind farm]]s and [[solar power plant]]s, and to compensate for unscheduled shutdowns of baseload power plants, or brief surges in demand for electricity.  . 

== Load following power plants == . 

[[Load following power plant]]s, also called intermediate power plants, are in between these extremes in terms of capacity factor, efficiency and cost per unit of electricity. They produce most of their electricity during the day, when prices and demand are highest. However, the demand and price of electricity is far lower during the night and intermediate plants shutdown or reduce their output to low levels overnight.  . 

== Capacity factor and renewable energy == . 

When it comes to several [[renewable energy]] sources such as [[solar power]], [[wind power]] and [[hydroelectricity]], there is a third reason for unused capacity. The plant may be capable of producing electricity, but its fuel ([[wind]], [[sunlight]] or [[water]]) [[Intermittent power source|may not be available]]. A hydroelectric plant's production may also be affected by requirements to keep the water level from getting too high or low and to provide water for [[fish]] downstream. However, solar, wind and hydroelectric plants do have high [[availability factor]]s, so when they have fuel available, they are almost always able to produce electricity. <ref>[http://www.awea.org/faq/basicen.html How Does A Wind Turbine's Energy Production Differ from Its Power Production?]</ref> . 

When hydroelectric plants have water available, they are also useful for load following, because of their high ''dispatchability''. A typical hydroelectric plant's operators can bring it from a stopped condition to full power in just a few minutes.  . 

[[Wind farm]]s are variable, due to the natural variability of the wind. For a wind farm, the capacity factor is mostly determined by the availability of wind.  Transmission line capacity and electricity demand also affect the capacity factor.  . 

[[Solar energy]] is variable because of the daily rotation of the earth and because of cloud cover. However, according to the [[SolarPACES]] programme of the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA), solar power plants designed for solar-only generation are well matched to summer noon peak loads in areas with significant cooling demands, such as [[Solar power in Spain|Spain]] or the [[Solar power plants in the Mojave Desert|south-western United States]].,<ref name=mangey/> although in some locations solar PV does not reduce the need for generation of network upgrades given that air conditioner peak demand often occurs in the late afternoon or early evening when solar output is zero. <ref>Muriel Watt [http://www.ergo.ee.unsw.edu.au/value%20of%20PV%20in%20summer%20peaks.pdf Value of PV in summer peaks]</ref><ref>Government of South Australia (2007), p.13,14 [http://www.climatechange.sa.gov.au/uploads/pdf/Feed-in_Discussion_Paper_submissions_closed.pdf South Australia’s Feed-In Mechanism for Residential Small-Scale Solar Photovoltaic Installations]</ref> SolarPACES states that by using thermal energy storage systems the operating periods of [[solar thermal power]] (CSP) stations can be extended to meet baseload needs. <ref name=mangey>Thomas R.

[http://www.iea.org/papers/2010/csp_roadmap.pdf  Technology Roadmap: Concentrating Solar Power] p. 5. </ref>  . 

[[Geothermal]] has a higher capacity factor than many other power sources, and geothermal resources are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. While the carrier medium for [[geothermal electricity]] (water) must be properly managed, the source of geothermal energy, the Earth's heat, will be available for the foreseeable future. <ref>[http://www.geo-energy.org/publications/reports/Environmental%20Guide.pdf A Guide to Geothermal Energy and the Environment]</ref> Geothermal power can be looked at as a nuclear battery where the heat is produced via the decay of radioactive elements in the core and mantle of the earth.  .
