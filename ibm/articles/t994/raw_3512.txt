The environmental benefits of [[renewable energy]] technologies are widely recognised, but the contribution that
they can make to [[energy security]] is less well known. Renewable technologies can enhance energy security in [[electricity generation]], heat supply, and [[transportation]]. <ref name=IEA>[http://www.iea.org/textbase/papers/2007/so_contribution.pdf Contribution of Renewables to Energy Security]</ref> . 

==Energy security== . 

Access to cheap energy has become essential to the functioning of modern economies. However, the uneven distribution of [[fossil fuel]] supplies among countries, and the critical need to widely access energy resources, has led to significant vulnerabilities. Threats to global [[energy security]] include political instability of energy producing countries, manipulation of energy supplies, competition over energy sources, attacks on supply infrastructure, as well as accidents and [[natural disaster]]s. <ref>[http://www.aspi.org.au/publications/publication_details.aspx?ContentID=142&pubtype=5  Power plays: Energy and Australia's security]</ref> . 

The [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] in Japan have brought new attention to how national energy systems are vulnerable to natural disasters, with climate change already bringing more weather and climate extremes. These threats to our old energy systems provide a rationale for investing in renewable energy. Shifting to renewable energy "can help us to meet the dual goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, thereby limiting future extreme weather and climate impacts, and ensuring reliable, timely, and cost-efficient delivery of energy". Investing in renewable energy can have significant dividends for our energy security. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/04/yet-another-reason-to-choose-renewable-energy?cmpid=SolarNL-Thursday-April21-2011 |title=Climate Risk: Yet Another Reason to Choose Renewable Energy |author=Amanda Staudt |date=20 April 2011  |work=Renewable Energy World }}</ref> . 

==Transportation== . 

The [[International Energy Agency]]'s ''World Energy Outlook 2006'' concludes that rising oil demand, if left unchecked,
would accentuate the consuming countries' vulnerability to a severe supply disruption and resulting price shock. Renewable biofuels for transport represent a key source of diversification from [[petroleum products]]. Biofuels from grain and beet in [[temperate region]]s have a part to play, but they are relatively expensive and their energy efficiency and CO2 savings benefits, are variable. Biofuels from sugar cane and other highly productive tropical crops are much more competitive and beneficial. But all first generation biofuels ultimately compete with food production for land, water, and other resources. Greater efforts are required to develop and commercialize second generation biofuel technologies, such as biorefineries and [[cellulosic ethanol|ligno-cellulosics]], enabling the flexible production of biofuels and other products from non-edible plant materials. <ref name=IEA /> . 

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), [[cellulosic ethanol commercialization]] could allow [[ethanol fuel]]s to play a much larger role in the future than previously thought. <ref>International Energy Agency (2006). [http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/summaries2006/English.pdf ''World Energy Outlook 2006''] p. 8. </ref> Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Dedicated energy crops, such as switchgrass, are also promising cellulose sources that can be produced in many regions of the United States. <ref>Biotechnology Industry Organization (2007). [http://bio.org/ind/biofuel/CellulosicEthanolIssueBrief.pdf ''Industrial Biotechnology Is Revolutionizing the Production of Ethanol Transportation Fuel''] pp. 3-4. </ref> . 

==Heating== . 

For those countries where growing dependence on imported gas is a significant energy security issue, renewable technologies can provide alternative sources of electric power as well as displacing electricity demand through direct heat production.  The IEA suggests that the direct contribution that renewables can make to domestic or commercial [[space heating]] and industrial process heat deserves closer attention. Heat from solar, and geothermal sources, as well as [[heat pump]]s, is increasingly cost effective but often falls through the gap between government programmes that promote public awareness and provide incentives for renewable electricity and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]. <ref name=IEA /> . 

[[Solar heating]] systems are a well known technology and generally consist of solar thermal collectors, a fluid system to move the heat from the collector to its point of usage, and a reservoir or tank for heat storage. The systems may be used to heat domestic hot water, swimming pools, or homes and businesses. <ref>[http://www.rmi.org/sitepages/pid705.php Solar water heating]</ref>  The heat can also be used for industrial process applications or as an energy input for other uses such as cooling equipment. <ref>[http://www.iea-shc.org/task25/index.html Solar assisted air-conditioning of buildings]</ref>  In many warmer climates, a solar heating system can provide a very high percentage (50 to 75%) of domestic hot water energy.  . 

==Electricity generation== . 

The deployment of renewable technologies usually increases the diversity of electricity sources and, through local generation, contributes to the flexibility of the system and its resistance to central shocks. The IEA suggests that attention in this area has focused disproportionately on the issue of the [[Intermittent power source|variability]] of renewable electricity production. <ref name=IEA /> However, this only applies to certain renewable technologies, mainly [[wind power]] and [[solar photovoltaics]], and its significance depends on a range of factors which include the penetration of the renewables concerned, the balance of plant on the system, the wider connectivity of the system, and the demand side flexibility. Variability will rarely be a barrier to increased renewable energy deployment. But at high levels of penetration it requires careful analysis and management, and any additional costs that may be required for back-up or system modification must be taken into account. <ref name=IEA /> . 

Renewable electricity supply in the 20-50+% penetration range has already been implemented in several European systems, albeit in the context of a integrated European grid system:<ref name=Lovins11>[[Amory Lovins]] (2011). ''[[Reinventing Fire]]'', Chelsea Green Publishing, p. 199. </ref> 
<blockquote>
In 2010, four German states, totaling 10 million people, relied on wind power for 43-52% of their annual electricity needs. Denmark isn't far behind, supplying 22% of its power from wind in 2010 (26% in an average wind year). The Extremadura region of Spain is getting up to 25% of its electricity from solar, while the whole country meets 16% of its demand from wind. Just during 2005-2010, Portugal vaulted from 17% to 45% renewable electricity. <ref name=Lovins11/> 
</blockquote>
Minnkota Power Cooperative, the leading U.S. wind utility in 2009, supplied 38% of its retail sales from the wind. <ref name=Lovins11/> . 

==Combined Power Plant==. 
The Combined Power Plant, a project linking 36 wind, solar, biomass, and hydroelectric installations throughout Germany, has demonstrated that a combination of renewable sources and more-effective control can balance out short-term power fluctuations and provide reliable electricity with 100 percent renewable energy. <ref>[http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/SOW09_chap4.pdf An Enduring Energy Future] p. 139. </ref><ref>[http://www.kombikraftwerk.de/index.php?id=27 The Combined Power Plant]</ref> .
