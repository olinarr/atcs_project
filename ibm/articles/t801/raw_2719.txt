{{Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel}}
{{Campaignbox Second Intifada}}
[[Palestinian militant|Palestinian]] [[rocket]] and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] attacks on [[Israel]] from the [[Gaza Strip]] have occurred since 2001. Between 2001 and January 2009, over 8,600 rockets had been launched, leading to 28 deaths and several hundred injuries,<ref name=BBC_Q&A>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7818022.stm Q&A: Gaza conflict], BBC News 18-01-2009</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3702088.stm Gaza's rocket threat to Israel], BBC 21-01-2008</ref> as well as widespread [[psychological trauma]] and disruption of daily life. <ref name=BBC_catandmouse/> According to research done by [[Sapir_Academic_College|Sapir Academic college]], around 15,000 people from Sderot are suffering from [[PTSD]] and 1000 are treated within the psychiatric community. <ref>Hamoza le briut hanefesh</ref>, According to a NATAL study (Center for Victims of Terror and War) done in 2008, between 70% to 94% of Sderot children suffer from symptoms of PTSD while 28% of children actually have PTSD.  . 

The weapons, often generically referred to as [[Qassam rocket|Qassams]], were initially crude and short-range, mainly affecting the [[Israel]]i city of [[Sderot]] and other communities bordering the Gaza Strip. However, in 2006 more sophisticated rockets began to be deployed, reaching the larger coastal city of [[Ashkelon]], and by early 2009 major cities [[Ashdod]] and [[Beersheba]] had been hit by [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha]] and [[BM-21 Grad|Grad]] rockets,and in 2011-2012 to the cities of Kiryat Gat and Gadera.  . 

Attacks have been carried out by all Palestinian armed groups,<ref name=ai/> and, prior to the 2008–2009 [[Gaza War]], were consistently supported by most Palestinians,<ref name=support/><ref name=pcpsr2004/><ref name=pcpsr2006/><ref name=pcpsr2008/> although the stated goals have been mixed. The attacks, widely condemned for targeting civilians, have been described as [[terrorism]] by [[United Nations]], [[European Union]] and Israeli officials, and are defined as [[war crime]]s by [[human rights]] groups [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]].  . 

Defenses constructed specifically to deal with the weapons include fortifications for schools and bus stops as well as an alarm system named [[Red Color]]. [[Iron Dome]], a system to intercept short-range rockets, was developed by Israel and first deployed in the spring of 2011 to protect Beersheba and Ashkelon, but officials and experts warned that it would not be completely effective. Shortly thereafter, it intercepted a Palestinian Grad rocket for the first time. <ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/iron-dome-successfully-intercepts-gaza-rocket-for-first-time-1.354696 Iron Dome successfully intercepts Gaza rocket for first time], Haaretz 07-04-2011</ref>  . 

The attacks were a stated cause of the [[Gaza blockade]], the Gaza War (Dec 27, 2008 – Jan 21, 2009) and other [[Israeli military]] operations in the Gaza Strip, including [[Operation Rainbow]] (May 2004), [[Operation Days of Penitence]] (2004), the [[2006 Israel-Gaza conflict]], [[Operation Autumn Clouds]] (2006), and [[Operation Hot Winter]] (2008).  .

[[File:Rocketpopmap.jpeg|thumb|rocket range]] . 

Attacks began in 2001. Since then, nearly 4,800 rockets have hit southern Israel, just over 4,000 of them since [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip]] in August 2005. The range of the rockets has increased over time. The original Qassam rocket has a range of about {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} but more advanced rockets, including versions of the old Soviet Grad or Katyusha have hit Israeli targets {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Gaza. <ref name=BBC_Q&A/> . 

Some analysts see the attacks as a shift away from reliance on [[suicide bombing]], which was previously Hamas's main method of attacking Israel, and an adoption of the rocket tactics used by Lebanese militant group [[Hezbollah]]. <ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,474804,00.html Hamas Adopting Rocket Tactics Used by Hezbollah], FOX News 31-12-2008</ref> .

[[File:A house in sderot hit by Qassam rocket.jpg|thumb|right|A house in Sderot hit by a Qassam rocket, 2007]]
Rockets were originally fired mainly on [[Sderot]], an Israeli city on the border of the Gaza Strip. <ref>{{cite web|author=Silverman, Anav|url=http://sderotmedia.com/?p=372|title=A City Under Siege: An Inside View of Sderot, Israel|publisher=Sderot Media Center|date=September 20, 2007|accessdate=October 20, 2008}}</ref> Sderot's population density is slightly greater than that of the Gaza Strip. Due to this, and despite the imperfect aim of these homemade projectiles, they have caused deaths and injuries, as well as significant damage to homes and property, psychological distress and emigration from the city. Ninety percent of the city's residents have had a rocket exploding in their street or an adjacent one. <ref name=BBC_Q&A/> . 

On March 28, 2006, while Israelis went to general elections, the first [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha]] rocket from Gaza was fired at Israel. The rocket fell near the [[Itfah]] [[kibbutz]] on the outskirts of Ashkelon and caused no damage or casualties. [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]] claimed responsibility. <ref>Yaakov Katz, [http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1143498754886&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Katyusha fired for first time from Gaza], Jerusalem Post 28-03-2009</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4855056.stm Katyusha rocket 'fired from Gaza'], BBC News 28-03-2006</ref> Several months later, On July 5, 2006, a rocket hit the center of Ashkelon for the first time, striking an empty high school. Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] called the attack, which was claimed by [[Hamas]], an "escalation of unprecedented gravity",<ref>Greg Myre and Steven Erlanger, [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/05/world/middleeast/05mideast.html A Gazan Rocket Reaches 6 Miles Into Israel], New York Times 05-07-2006</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5152326.stm Israel tanks enter northern Gaza], BBC News 06-07-2006</ref> but the event was quickly overshadowed by the [[2006 Lebanon War]].  . 

===2007===. 
On January 5, 2007 [[Palestinian militant]]s fired a Katyusha rocket at Ashkelon. The Katyusha has a range of 18–20 kilometers, and the rocket was fired from the [[al-Attara]] region in the northern Gaza Strip, traveling about 17 kilometers before reaching its target. No one was hurt in the Katyusha attack. Israel killed in response at least 9 people. <ref>Haaretz correspondents and Associated Press, [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/941556.html Katyusha lands in northern Ashkelon; nine Palestinians killed in IDF response], Haaretz 05-01-2007</ref> On October 7, 2007 the [[Popular Resistance Committees]] claimed responsibility for a [[BM-21 Grad|Grad]]-type Katyusha that hit [[Netivot]].

In January 2008 the border between Gaza and Egypt was breached by Hamas. It allowed them to bring in Russian and Iranian made rockets with a larger range.  . 

Two premature Palestinian babies, admitted to the Barzilai Medical Center's NICU unit, were among the civilian targets of Iranian Grad rockets launched by Hamas at Ashkelon. Their mother  Beit Lahiya was told by Palestinians doctors in Gaza that two [[embryo]]s out of the four she carried  died in  her [[womb]], and if she wants to save two other babies, she had to go to Israel. Israeli official granted her entrance in 24 hours after it was requested. She gave the birth to a boy and a girl in [[Barzilai Medical Center]] on February 25, 2008. On the second day after the birth,  Grad rocket hit the hospital ground only 200 meters away from Palestinian mother and her new born twins. <ref>Christopher Sultan [http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,540689,00.html], Spiegel online International 3-11-2008</ref><ref>Barzilai Medical Center [http://www.barzilaimc.org.il/Eng/?CategoryID=241&ArticleID=264], Barzilai Medical Center</ref> . 

In the first half of 2008, the number of attacks rose sharply, consistently totaling several hundred per month. In addition, Ashkelon was hit many times during this period by Grad rockets.  . 

From June 19 to December 19, 2008, an Egyptian-mediated [[2008 Israel–Hamas ceasefire|ceasefire between Israel and Hamas]] was in effect. During this time, only several dozen rockets were fired at Israel, a marked decrease from the pre-ceasefire period. Hamas imprisoned some of those firing rockets. <ref>Ethan Bronner, [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/20/world/middleeast/20mideast.html?_r=1&scp=2&sq=Ethan%20Bronner%20December%202008%20gaza&st=cse Gaza Truce May Be Revived by Necessity], New York Times 19-12-2008</ref> . 

During the [[2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict]], Palestinian militants began to deploy improved [[Qassam rocket|Qassam]] and [[BM-21|factory-made]] rockets with a range of 40 kilometers. <ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/middleeastCrisis/idUSL6529388 "FACTBOX-Hamas's arsenal of rockets"], Reuters 06-01-2009</ref> Rockets reached major Israeli cities [[Ashdod]],<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2008/12/mil-081230-voa04.htm Israel's Ashdod Hit by Gaza Rocket for First Time], Voice of America (retrieved from globalsecurity.org) 30-12-2008</ref> [[Beersheba]] and [[Gedera]] for the first time, putting one-eighth of Israel's population in rocket range<ref>Amy Teibel and Ian Deitch, [http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ihB3ICCsDBBrVdklc0zaYpcx8H3wD95ME2KO0 "Despite Gaza toll, Israeli media focus on Israel"], Associated Press 13-01-2009</ref> and raising concerns about the safety of the [[Tel Aviv]] metropolitan area, Israel's largest population center,<ref>Noa Kosharek, [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1051961.html "Tel Aviv, Rishon Letzion prepare bomb shelters in case of attack"], Ha'aretz 01-01-2009</ref><ref>Yaakov Katz and Yaakov Lappin, [http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1230733174826&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull "Rehovot, Rishon may be in rocket range"], Jerusalem Post 05-01-2009</ref> as well as the [[Negev Nuclear Research Center]]. <ref>James Hider, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article5430133.ece Gaza rockets put Israel’s nuclear plant in battle zone], The Times 02-01-2009</ref> According to Isaeli authorities, 571 rockets and 205 mortar shells landed in Israel during the 22 days of the conflict. <ref name=ai/> .

==Tactics==. 
[[Khaled Jaabari]], Gaza commander of the [[al-Aqsa Martyr's Brigades]], said that the group uses [[Google Earth]] to determine targets. <ref>Clancy Chassay and Bobbie Johnson, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/oct/25/google.israel Google Earth used to target Israel], the Guardian 25-10-2007</ref> Rocket fire is often timed for the early morning when children head to school. <ref name=IRIN76438/><ref>Heather Sharp, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7802276.stm Rocket attacks plague Israeli towns], BBC News 28-12-2009</ref> . 

A source close to Hamas described the movement's tactic of launching projectiles from between homes during the [[2008-2009 Israel-Gaza conflict]]: "They fired rockets in between the houses and covered the alleys with sheets so they could set the rockets up in five minutes without the planes seeing them. The moment they fired, they escaped, and they are very quick."<ref name=parsing>Ethan Bronner, [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/19/world/middleeast/19assess.html?emc=rss&partner=rss Parsing Gains of Gaza War], ''[[New York Times]]'' 18-01-2009</ref> Videos released by Hamas in 2011 show Qassam rockets being fired from residential areas and mosques. According to ''[[Yedioth Aharonoth]]'' journalist Elior Levy, "Gaza terror cells choose to fire from urban areas knowing that the Israel Defense Forces refrain from intercepting them for fear of hurting civilians. The killing of civilians in Gaza also serves the terrorists' purposes who claim Israel is committing war crimes in Gaza."<ref>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4055975,00.html Video: Gaza rockets fired from civilian centers], Israel News 1204-2011</ref> .

===Fortifications and bomb shelters===. 
[[Image:Sderot Shelter.JPG|thumb|Bomb shelter in Sderot]] . 

Residential buildings and homes in Israel are generally equipped with [[bomb shelters]]. However, as of February 2009, approximately 5,000 residents of southern Israel, mostly elderly immigrants from the former Soviet Union, lacked proper reinforced rooms or reasonable access to public shelters. <ref>Yuval Azoulay, [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1061105.html 5000 southerners, mostly elderly, lack access to rocket shelter], Haaretz 04-02-2009</ref> Many Sderot families sleep together in a single fortified room in their homes. <ref name=BBC_010908/> . 

In March 2008 the Israeli Government placed 120 fortified bus stops in Sderot, following a Defense Ministry assessment that most qassam-related injuries and fatalities were caused by shrapnel wounds in victims on the street. <ref>Yuval Azoulay, [http://themarker.captain.co.il/hasen/pages/ShArtStEng.jhtml?itemNo=961201&contrassID=1&subContrassID=1&title='Gov't%20places%20120%20fortified%20bus%20stops%20in%20rocket-plagued%20Sderot%20'&dyn_server=172.20.5.5 Gov't places 120 fortified bus stops in rocket-plagued Sderot], 05-03-2008</ref> As of January 2009, all schools in Sderot have been fortified against rockets;<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28605322/#storyContinued School resumes in Israel despite rocket threat: Some students continue to stay home to avoid Hamas rocket attacks], Associated Press (retrieved from MSNBC) 11-01-2009</ref> fortifications consist of arched canopies over roofs. <ref name=BBC_010908>Heather Sharp, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7592303.stm Sderot children feel truce relief], BBC News 01-09-2008</ref> However, on January 3, 2009 a Grad rocket penetrated the fortification of a school in Ashkelon. <ref>Shmulik Hadad, [http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3678847,00.html Experts: Grads in Ashkelon were advanced], Ynet 03-01-2009</ref> . 

In March 2009, Sderot inaugurated a reinforced children's recreation center built by the [[Jewish National Fund]]. The purpose of the center, which has "$1.5 million worth of reinforced steel", is to provide a rocket-proof place for children to play. <ref>Ethan Bronner, [http://www.iht.com/articles/2009/03/12/mideast/playground.php For Israeli children, a playground shielded from rockets], New York Times 11-03-2009 (retrieved from the International Herald Tribune)</ref><ref>Aron Heller, [http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5huJFx6OmH1O_HPbrdsjhZ3wTrhwQD96RCKSG1 Israeli kids get rocket-proofed indoor playground], Associated Press.

===Red Dawn===. 
{{Main|Red Color}} . 

The Israeli government has installed a "[[Red Dawn (alert)|Red Color]]" (צבע אדום) alarm system to warn citizens of impending rocket attacks, although its effectiveness has been questioned. The system currently operates in a number of southern Israeli cities within rocket range. When the signature of a rocket launch is detected originating in [[Gaza]], the system automatically activates the public broadcast warning system in nearby Israeli communities and military bases. A two-tone electronic audio alert (with a pattern of high, 2 second pause, high-low) is broadcast twice, followed by a recorded female voice<ref>mobile ring tone 'shahar adom' http://mz11.mediazone.co.il/mediazone/34/2166!0.wmv</ref> intoning the Hebrew words for Red Color ("Tzeva Adom"). <ref name=LivingGaza >[[Christian Science Monitor]]"Living at Gaza's edge grows perilous, again" http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0615/p07s02-wome.html</ref> The entire program is repeated until all rockets have impacted and no further launches are detected. In [[Sderot]], it gives residents approximately 15 seconds warning of an incoming rocket. <ref name="LivingGaza" /> The system was installed in Ashkelon between July 2005 and April 2006.  . 

===Iron Dome===. 
{{Main|Iron Dome}} . 

'''Iron Dome''' ({{lang-he|כיפת ברזל}}) is a mobile system developed by [[Rafael Advanced Defense Systems]] designed to intercept short-range [[rocket]]s with a range less than 70&nbsp;km. In February 2007, the system was selected by [[Israeli Defense Minister]] [[Ehud Barak]] as the [[Israeli Defense Force]]'s defense system against short range rockets. On July 7, 2008, the first test of the system was completed successfully, and the first operational test is expected to take place at the end of 2009. <ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j6rs26JRbqL-VgDfyw0EzwJXmKygD96CO10O0 Israel used fighting to perfect anti-rocket system],{{Dead link|date=May 2010}} Associated Press.

The system is composed of a [[radar]], a control center, and interceptor missiles. Very limited information has been made available about the system in the Israeli media, but from this information it is known that the interceptor missile (named '''Tamir''') is equipped with electro-optic sensors and several steering fins, providing it with high maneuverability. The system's radar identifies the rocket launch, extrapolates its flight path and transfers this information to the control center, which then uses this information to determine the projected impact location. If the projected target justifies an interception, then an interceptor missile is fired.  .

In May 2007, a significant increase in rocket attacks from Gaza prompted the temporary evacuation of thousands of residents from Sderot. <ref>{{cite web|author=Kershner, Isabel|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/05/31/europe/town.php|title=Israeli Border Town Lives in the Shadow of Falling Rockets|publisher=International Herald Tribune|date=May 31, 2007|accessdate=October 20, 2008}}</ref> According to the United Nations, 40 percent of the city's residents left in the last two weeks of May. <ref name=OCHA_010607>[http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/OCHA_Gaza_Situation_June01.pdf Situation Report Gaza June 1, 2007], UN OCHA</ref> During the summer of 2007, 3,000 of the city's 22,000 residents (comprising mostly the city's key upper and middle class residents){{Citation needed|reason=A side statement like this needs to be verified.

===Psychological===. 
[[File:Mother consoles daughter after rocket attack.jpg|thumb|left|An injured woman in Sderot consoles her daughter as she is led away by an emergency medical team]]
In 2008, Natal, the Israel Center for Victims of Terror and War, conducted a study on the city of Sderot based on representative sampling. The study found that between 75 percent and 94 percent of Sderot children aged 4–18 exhibited symptoms of post-traumatic stress. 28 percent of adults and 30 percent of children had [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD). The co-director of the study emphasized the distinction between post-traumatic stress symptoms, such as problems sleeping and concentrating, and PTSD itself, which can interfere seriously with daily life. <ref name=IRIN76438>[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=76438 ISRAEL-OPT: Relentless rocket attacks take psychological toll on children in Sderot], IRIN News (UN OCHA) 27-01-2008</ref><ref>Mijal Grinberg and Eli Ashkenazi, [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/945489.html Study: Most Sderot kids exhibit post-traumatic stress symptoms], Haaretz 17.01.2008</ref> . 

An [[American Psychiatric Association]] study published in 2010, headed by Professor Yair Bar-Chaim of [[Tel Aviv University]], found that incidence rate for post-traumatic symptoms among Israeli civilians was correlated with proximity to the Gaza Strip. Civilians who lived in areas where rockets frequently exploded, and where there was less warning time in advance of strikes, had a higher chance of developing post-traumatic symptoms than those living far enough from Gaza to have one minute or more in which to seek shelter after rockets were launched. The study also found that life under rocket fire sometimes led to [[cognitive disengagement]] from threat. Cognitive disengagement was positively correlated with the likelihood of developing pathologies such as post-traumatic stress disorder and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. <ref>[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/137039 Study Links Rocket Attacks with Trauma], Israel National News 15-04-2010</ref> . 

During the Gaza War, when rockets were falling on the city of [[Ashdod]], the municipality opened a treatment centre for those with shell shock. <ref>[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportID=82174 ISRAEL-OPT: Gaza rockets cause shock, fear in southern Israel], IRIN News (UN OCHA) 02-01-2009</ref> . 

According to a 2009 [[Amnesty International]] report,
<blockquote>
Scores [of rockets] have struck homes, businesses, schools, other public buildings and vehicles in and around towns and villages in southern Israel. It is purely by chance that in most cases such strikes have not caused death or injury, and the lethal potential of such projectiles should not be underestimated. Above all, the constant threat of impending rocket attacks has caused fear and disrupted the lives of the growing number of Israelis who live within range of such attacks, reaching up to a million. <ref name=ai/>
</blockquote>Also in 2009, a spokeswoman for the Sderot [[Hosen Center]], which provides psychological support and rehabilitation for the community, reported that attacks had taken a high toll on the mental health of children and adults in and around Sderot. <blockquote>
Children are afraid to sleep on their own, to be on their own, even to go to the toilet alone. They feel that their parents cannot protect them. Bed wetting is a common manifestation of their anxiety and insecurity. Their parents are similarly anxious and frustrated. It is even difficult to speak of PTSD, for as long as the rockets fall the trauma is renewed daily; we are not even in a post-trauma stage. <ref name=ai/>
</blockquote> . 

===Political===. 
On December 12, 2007, after more than 20 rockets landed in the Sderot area in a single day, including a direct hit to one of the main avenues, Sderot mayor Eli Moyal announced his resignation, citing the government's failure to halt the rocket attacks. <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7140784.stm|title=Israeli Mayor Quits Over Rockets|publisher=BBC Online|date=December 12, 2007|accessdate=October 20, 2008}}</ref> Moyal was persuaded to retract his resignation.  . 

On February 9, 2009, Palestinian Authority foreign minister Riad Malki accused Hamas of trying to influence the outcome of the [[Israeli legislative election, 2009|2009 Israeli general election]] by keeping up the rocket fire on southern Israel. <ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1062761.html PA: Hamas rockets are bid to sway Israeli election], Associated Press (retrieved from Haaretz) 09-02-2009</ref> . 

==Motives==. 
Rationales given by the Palestinian groups responsible for the attacks vary, but often include the argument that the rockets are a method of protest and of calling attention to perceived injustices. According to other explanations, the attacks constitute revenge for – or defense against – perceived Israeli aggression.  . 

===Hamas===. 
[[Image:Khaled Meshaal 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Khaled Mashal]], political leader of [[Hamas]]]]
Hamas co-founder [[Mahmoud Zahar]] has said that the goal of the attacks is to force mass migration in Israel and disrupt the daily life of its citizens. Explaining why his group had moved from [[List of Palestinian suicide attacks|suicide bombing]] to rocket attacks, he said:
<blockquote>Which do you think is more effective, martyrdom operations or rockets against Sderot? Rockets against Sderot will cause mass migration, greatly disrupt daily lives and government administration and can make a much huger impact on the government. We are using the methods that convince the Israelis that their occupation is costing them too much. We are succeeding with the rockets. We have no losses and the impact on the Israeli side is so much. <ref>Melanie Phillips, [http://www.spectator.co.uk/melaniephillips/449431/president-bushs-visionary-hero.thtml President Bush's visionary hero], The Spectator 15-01-2008</ref></blockquote> . 

According to the BBC, Hamas views the attacks as legitimate because it regards the whole of [[Palestine (region)|historic Palestine]] (roughly coterminous with Israel, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Jordan) as [[Divisions of the world in Islam|Islamic land]], and thus sees the state of Israel as an occupier. <blockquote>
[Hamas] regards the whole of historic Palestine as Islamic land and therefore views the state of Israel as an occupier, though it has offered a [[Hudna#Hudna in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict|10-year "truce"]] if Israel withdraws to the lines held before the [[Six-Day War|war of 1967]]. It therefore generally justifies any actions against Israel, which has included [[suicide bombings]] and rocket attacks, as legitimate resistance. Specifically in Gaza, it argued that [[Gaza blockade|Israel's blockade]] justified a counter-attack by any means possible. <ref name="BBC-QA-Gazaconflict">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7818022.stm|title=Q&A: Gaza conflict|date=January 18, 2009|publisher=BBC|accessdate=April 28, 2009}}</ref>
</blockquote> . 

Hamas has given other explanations concerning various attacks. [[Salah Bardawil]], a Palestinian legislator who serves as spokesman for the Hamas faction in parliament, has said "We know we can't achieve military equality, but when a person suffers huge pain he has to respond somehow. This is how we defend ourselves. This is how we tell the world we are here."<ref name=NYT_Balance>Greg Myre, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7D81030F93AA35754C0A9609C8B63 Rockets Create a 'Balance of Fear' With Israel, Gaza Residents Say], 09-07-2006</ref> Regarding specific strikes in 2007, Hamas political chief [[Khaled Mashaal]] called the attacks self-defense and retaliation against Israeli killings of Hamas supporters. <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,269091,00.html|title=Hamas: Rocket Attacks on Israel Are 'Self Defense'|agency=Associated Press|date=April 29, 2007 | work=Fox News}}</ref> In January 2009 Mashaal called the rockets "our cry of protest to the world"<ref>Khalid Mish'al, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jan/06/gaza-israel-hamas This brutality will never break our will to be free], The Guardian 09-01-2009</ref>

FOX News 24-12-2008</ref> . 

===PFLP===. 
A spokesperson from the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP), on January 17, 2009, called the rockets a "representation of our resistance", stressing that as long as rockets were launched, "our cause is alive". <blockquote>The rockets are both a practical and a symbolic representation of our resistance to the occupier [Israel]. They are a constant reminder that the occupier is in fact an occupier, and that no matter how they may engage in sieges, massacres, fence us in, deny us the basic human needs of life, we will continue to resist and we will continue to hold fast to our fundamental rights, and we will not allow them to be destroyed. So long as one rocket is launched at the occupier, our people, our resistance and our cause is alive. </blockquote><blockquote>This is why they targeted the rockets – the rockets do make the occupier insecure, because every one is a symbol and a physical act of our rejection to their occupation, to their massacres, to their crimes, and to their continuing assaults on our people. Each rocket says that we will not allow their so-called "solutions" [the [[Israeli-Palestinian peace process]]] that are based on the abrogation and denial of our rights. <ref>[http://www.pflp.ps/english/?q=pflp-interview-ma-news-agency-israeli-aggression-g PFLP Interview with Ma'an News Agency on Israeli Aggression in Gaza], Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine 17-01-2009</ref>
</blockquote> . 

The PFLP claimed responsibility for a April 3, 2010 mortar attack on Israel's [[Shaar Hanegev]] region, saying that it was carried out "in response to [[Zionist]] crimes". The group did not elaborate further. <ref>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3871567,00.html IDF attacks 2 Palestinians near Kissufim], Ynet News 04-04-2010</ref><ref>[http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&item_no=353016&version=1&template_id=37&parent_id=17 Mortar round fired at Israel], Gulf News 04-04-2010</ref> . 

===Other groups===. 
On January 19, 2009, the [[al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades]], the military wing of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's [[Fatah]] party, published a statement listing its claimed attacks on Israel, including claimed rocket and mortar attacks on Sderot and Ashkelon. The group stated that the attacks were carried out "to defend our people in the Gaza Strip" and "to defend the Gaza Strip in the face of [[Zionist]] arrogance", but did not elaborate further. <ref name=ai>[http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE15/015/2009/en/8f299083-9a74-4853-860f-0563725e633a/mde150152009en.pdf Israel/Gaza Operation 'Cast Lead': 22 Days of Death and Destruction], Amnesty International 2009</ref><ref>[http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ar&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kataibaqssa.com%2Fnewarab%2Fnews.php%3Faction%3Dview%26id%3D568 Harvest operations and activities of the military-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades in the face of the enemy in the battle for Gaza], [[Aqsa Martyrs Brigades]]Media Centre</ref> .

[[Ansar al-Sunna]], a small, [[al-Qaida]]-inspired [[Salafist]] militant group, claimed responsibility for an March 18, 2010 Qassam rocket attack on [[Netiv Haasara]] that killed 33-year-old [[Thailand|Thai national]] Manee Singmueangphon, calling it a response to Israel's "Judaization" of Islamic holy places. The group did not clarify which acts or which Islamic holy places it was referring to. Further obscuring the motivation for the attack, the [[Aqsa Martyrs Brigades]], independently claimed responsibility later. <ref name=group>[http://www.upi.com/Top_News/International/2010/03/19/Group-Rocket-responsibility-is-Hamass/UPI-17591269016702/ Group: Rocket responsibility is Hamas's], UPI 19-03-2010</ref><ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1157365.html 'Israel will defend itself from Gaza rockets, regardless of Goldstone'], Haaretz 18-03-2010</ref><ref>[http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=171296 Israel vows to respond to Kassam hit], Jerusalem Post 18-03-2010</ref><ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ioi_0jtO9RjMwPNRoXNCndRPRq3gD9EH8F180 Gaza rocket kills Thai farm worker in Israel], Associated Press 18-03-2010</ref> . 

==Views==. 
===Palestinians===. 
Prior to the 2008–2009 [[Gaza War]], polls conducted by the [[Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research]] (PCPSR) showed consistently high levels of support for the rocket attacks among the Palestinian public. 
* September 2004: 75% of Palestinians support "the firing of rockets from [[Beit Hanoun]]", though 59% of the residents of Beit Hanoun reject the practice. <ref name=pcpsr2004>[http://www.pcpsr.org/survey/polls/2004/p13epressrelease.html Poll No. 13 – Press Release], PSR – Survey Research Unit 30-09-2004</ref>

Conversely, polls conducted after the Gaza War indicated weaker support for the attacks and relatively broad support for attempts to prevent them. 
* January 2010 [[Palestinian Center for Public Opinion]] (PCPO) poll: 62.2% of Palestinians oppose "the re-firing of Al-Qassam rockets from Gaza at Israel" while 29.1% are in favor. <ref>[http://pcpo.org/polls/poll170.htm Poll No. 170 Jan 01, 2010], PCPO</ref>

The firing of rockets from the [[Gaza Strip]] into [[Israel]] has been opposed by those living closest to the firing location due to Israeli military responses. On July 23, 2004 a family attempted to physically prevent the [[Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades]] from setting up a rocket launcher outside their house. Members of the brigade shot and killed one boy wounded 5 others. <ref>{{cite web

===Israel===. 
On December 27, 2008, upon the commencement of Operation Cast Lead, Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] said in an address to the nation: "for approximately seven years, hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens in the south have been suffering from rockets being fired at them. Life in the south under rocket barrages had become unbearable. Israel did everything in its power to fulfill the conditions of the calm in the south and enable normal life for its citizens in the communities adjacent to the Gaza Strip. The quiet that we offered was met with shelling."<ref>[http://www.jewishpolicycenter.org/article/543 PM Olmert's Remarks on the Operation in the Gaza Strip], Jewish Policy Center</ref> . 

===Egypt===. 
The August 2, 2010 [[Rocket attacks on Eilat and Aqaba]] sparked rage in Egypt at Hamas and [[Iran]]. The Egyptian press stated that the firing of the rockets from Egyptian territory by Hamas or by organizations cooperating with it constituted the crossing of a red line. The Egyptian position is that Iran is employing local proxies, such as Hamas, to escalate violence in the Middle East and to sabotage the Palestinian reconciliation efforts, as well as efforts to renew Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations. <ref>[http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4568.htm Rage in Egypt at Hamas and Iran following Rocket Attacks on Eilat, Aqaba], MEMRI Special Dispatch No.3200</ref> . 

Later that year, the Egyptian government daily [[Al-Gumhouriyya]] slammed Hamas's firing of "primitive" rockets at Israel that, according to the writer, serve only to prompt a deadly response from Israel. He blamed Hamas for turning the Gaza Strip into a big prison isolated from the world, where the residents suffer poverty while the leaders live in luxury. <ref>Al-Gumhouriyya (Egypt), October 22, 2010. By Abdallah Al-Naggar. translation by [http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4715.htm MEMRI]</ref> . 

===United Nations===. 
On January 18, 2009, [[United Nations Secretary General]] [[Ban Ki-Moon]] said "for the sake of the people of Gaza, I urge in the strongest possible terms Hamas to stop firing rockets."<ref>[http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=29580&Cr=Gaza&Cr1 Ban calls for end to Hamas rocket attacks, Israeli withdrawal from Gaza], UN News Centre 18-01-2009</ref> On January 20, while visiting Sderot, the Secretary General called the rocket attacks "appalling and unacceptable". He added that the projectiles are indiscriminate weapons, and that Hamas attacks are violations of basic humanitarian law. <ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/ban-kimoon-lsquoappalledrsquo-by-gaza-destruction-1451889.html Ban Ki-moon ‘appalled’ by Gaza destruction], The Independent 20-01-2009</ref> Earlier, in November 2007, Ban had condemned a rocket attack launched from a UN-run Gaza school. <ref>[http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=24593&Cr=palestin&Cr1 Ban Ki-moon condemns rocket attack from Gaza school run by UN agency], UN News Centre 08-11-2007</ref> . 

On February 17, 2008, [[John Holmes (British diplomat)|John Holmes]], United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian
Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator said while visiting Sderot, "The people of Sderot and the surrounding area have had to live with these unacceptable and indiscriminate rocket attacks for seven years now. There is no doubt about the physical and psychological suffering these attacks are causing. I condemn them utterly and call on those responsible to stop them now without conditions". <ref name=OCHA_170208>[http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ERC_visit_Day_4_Press_Release_17_Feb_2008_English.pdf UN HUMANITARIAN CHIEF: ONLY A JUST AND LASTING PEACE CAN END HUMAN SUFFERING IN ISRAEL AND PALESTINE], UN OCHA 17-02-2008</ref> . 

Following a July 30, 2010, Palestinian Grad missile attack on the heart of [[Ashkelon]], United Nations Middle East envoy [[Robert Serry]] said that indiscriminate rocket fire against civilians was completely unacceptable, and constituted a terrorist attack. <ref name=serry>[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2010/0731/1224275906571.html Israel pledges response to missile attack from Gaza], ''Irish Times'' 31-07-2010</ref> . 

===United States===. 
In July 2008 Democratic presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] said: "If somebody was sending rockets into my house, where my two daughters sleep at night, I’m going to do everything in my power to stop that, and I would expect Israelis to do the same thing."<ref>Steven Lee Myers and Helene Cooper, [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/29/washington/29diplo.html Obama Defers to Bush, for Now, on Gaza Crisis], New York Times 28-12-2009</ref> On December 28, 2008, Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] said in a statement: "the United States strongly condemns the repeated rocket and mortar attacks against Israel". <ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,473167,00.html U.S. Condemns Hamas in Midst of Israeli Strikes], Fox News 28-12-2008</ref> On March 2, 2009 Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] condemned the attacks. <ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gid-B97gmhLgqf8brVLEKN46E-Lw Clinton calls for 'durable' Gaza truce, condemns rockets], AFP 02-03-2009</ref> . 

===European Union===. 
On June 7, 2005, The European Union presidency, held by [[Luxembourg]], condemned the firing of rockets by Palestinians at Gush Katif in the Gaza Strip and against Sderot. <ref>[http://www.eu2005.lu/en/actualites/pesc/2005/06/07gaza/index.html Declaration by the Presidency of the European Union on the firing of rockets at Gush Katif and Sderot in the Gaza Strip], 07-06-2005</ref> In January 2009, European Union Aid Commissioner [[Louis Michel]] said "Launching rockets at civilians is a terrorist action, which has to be strongly denounced."<ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-01/27/content_10723544.htm Hamas slams EU official over anti-Hamas statement], Xinhua 26-01-2009</ref> . 

===Human rights groups===. 
The attacks have been condemned as [[war crime]]s, both because they usually target civilians and because the weapons' inaccuracy would disproportionately endanger civilians even if military targets were chosen. [[Human Rights Watch]] has also condemned the attackers for firing from near residential structures, thus putting Gazan civilians at unnecessary risk. <ref name=HRW>[http://www.hrw.org/en/node/10911/section/3 Indiscriminate Fire], [[Human Rights Watch]] 30-06-2007</ref> According to Israeli human rights group [[B'Tselem]],
<blockquote>
Palestinian organizations that fire Qassam rockets openly declare that they intend to strike, among other targets, Israeli civilians. Attacks aimed at civilians are immoral and illegal, and the intentional killing of civilians is a grave breach under the Fourth Geneva Convention, a war crime, and cannot be justified, whatever the circumstances. Furthermore, Qassam rockets are themselves illegal, even when aimed at military objects, because the rockets are so imprecise and endanger civilians in the area from which the rockets are fired as well as where they land, thus violating two fundamental principles of the laws of war: distinction and proportionality. <ref name=B>[http://www.btselem.org/english/Israeli_Civilians/Qassam_missiles.asp Qassam rocket fire into Israel], B'Tselem</ref>
</blockquote> . 

==Attacks from outside the Gaza Strip==. 
===West Bank===. 
[[File:Is-wb-gs-gh v3.png|right|thumb|The West Bank abuts [[Jerusalem]] and lies within several kilometers of the [[Tel Aviv metropolitan area]] and [[Ben Gurion International Airport]].]]
There have been several attempts by Palestinian groups to fire rockets at Israel from the [[West Bank]], though none of these have been successful. <ref name=fatah_threaten/> Such an attack could easily strike one of Israel's most densely populated areas. <ref name=hand/> . 

In December 2005, [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]] and Fatah's [[al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades]] fired a Qassam rocket at Israel from the West Bank city of [[Jenin]]. The rocket landed within the West Bank, in proximity to the Israeli border village of [[Ram-On]]. The attack marked the first time a Qassam fired at Israel from the West Bank and came close to hitting a Jewish community. <ref>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3193067,00.html Qassam fired from West Bank], Ynet News 01-01-2006</ref> . 

In July 2006, a ranking member of Fatah's al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades in the West Bank said his group had the ability to produce rockets in the northern West Bank and that major Israeli cities as well as [[Ben Gurion International Airport]] would eventually become Palestinian rocket targets. "Every day our rockets in Gaza become more accurate and do more killing and this is exactly what will happen in the West Bank", he said. <ref>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3274774,00.html Al-Aqsa leader: West Bank rocket war is on], Ynet News 13-07-2006</ref> . 

In November 2006, A West Bank Fatah cell named [[Jondallah]] (God's soldiers) threatened to fire rockets at Israeli targets. At a news conference in [[Nablus]], a group of 20 masked militants of the cell brandished four rockets. One of the projectiles, which was 1.5 metres (five feet) in length, was claimed by the group to have "a range of five kilometres (two miles) and a three kilogram payload". "We have a certain number of these rockets and we are going to use them when the time is right," said one of the armed militants. <ref name=fatah_threaten>[http://www.haaretz.com/news/fatah-men-threaten-west-bank-rocket-fire-at-israeli-targets-1.205758 Fatah men threaten West Bank rocket fire at Israeli targets], Haaretz 29-11-2006</ref> . 

In February 2010, Palestinian Authority security forces in the West Bank arrested a Hamas cell preparing to test-fire a Qassam rocket near [[Ramallah]] and handed the rocket over to Israel. Hamas later stated that "Having a Qassam rocket in the West Bank is a demand that must be achieved". <ref name=hand>[http://www.haaretz.com/news/palestinians-hand-israel-qassam-rocket-seized-in-west-bank-1.266093 Palestinians hand Israel Qassam rocket seized in West Bank], Haaretz 22-02-2010</ref><ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-03/01/c_13193064.htm Hamas seeks to have rockets in West Bank], Xinhua 01-0302010</ref> . 

On June 20, 2010, senior Hamas official [[Mahmoud a-Zahar]] called on Palestinian residents of the [[West Bank]] to fire rockets into Israel. <ref>[http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=178963 A-Zahar calls for rockets to be fired from West Bank], Jerusalem Post 20-06-2010</ref> . 

On October 22, 2010, the [[Palestinian Authority]] seized a large cache of arms, including mortar shells, which it said were meant to be used by Hamas terrorists targeting Palestinian Authority officials or attempting to sabotage Palestinian Authority security enforcement in the West Bank. Hamas denied this, stating that any weapons would be used against "the occupation", apparently referring to Israel. <ref>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3973335,00.html PA says uncovered Hamas arms cache], Ynet News 22-10-2010</ref><ref>[http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2010/10/22/PA-Hamas-arms-cache-seized/UPI-44311287767229/ PA: Hamas arms cache seized], UPPI 22-10-2010</ref> . 

===Egypt===. 
{{main|Rocket attacks on Eilat and Aqaba}} . 

In 2010, [[Hamas]] carried out two rocket attacks on Israel from the [[Sinai Peninsula]] in [[Egypt]]. On April 22, three 122&nbsp;mm [[Grad rockets]] were fired from the Sinai Peninsula at the [[Red Sea]] resort town of [[Eilat]] in the extreme south of Israel. The projectiles landed in the Red Sea and the neighboring town of [[Aqaba]] in [[Jordan]], causing some property damage. <ref name=Post>[http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=173675 "Two rockets land in Eilat area,"] 04/22/2010, Jerusalem Post. </ref> Again on August 2, six or seven Iranian-made 122&nbsp;mm Grad rockets were fired from the Sinai Peninsula at Eilat. The rockets fell in Eilat, Aqaba, Egypt and the Red Sea. A rocket that landed in Aqaba killed a Jordanian civilian and wounded several. The investigation into the attacks involved cooperation between Israel, Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority. The attacks severely damaged relations between Hamas and Egypt, which viewed them as a challenge to its sovereignty. <ref name=itic>[http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/malam_multimedia/English/eng_n/html/hamas_e124.htm], [[Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center]] 15-08-2010</ref><ref name=Ammonnews>[http://en.ammonnews.net/article.aspx?articleNO=9217 "Victim of rocket that blasted Aqaba dies of wounds, 4 others injured"], 2010-08-02, Ammon News. </ref><ref name=multiple>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/jordan/7922624/Jordanian-national-killed-in-multiple-militant-rocket-strike.html Jordanian national killed in multiple militant rocket strike], The Telegraph 02-08-2010</ref> . 

===Lebanon===. 
{{Main|List of Lebanese rocket attacks on Israel}}
Palestinian militants in [[Lebanon]] have launched fatal rocket attacks on towns in northern Israel at least since the 1970s,<ref>'Rocket barrage hits Kiryat Shmona, Israel', [[Bryan Times]] 23-09-1977, p. 1</ref><ref>'Israeli Aircraft Bomb Lebanon', [[Michigan Daily]] 10-11-1977, p. 2</ref><ref>'Palestinians rocket Israel', [[Spokane Daily Chronicle]] 11-04-1979, p. 39</ref> but these incidents lie outside the scope of this article, as the topic of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel typically refers to attacks on southern Israel since 2001 and the [[Second Intifada]]. Rocket attacks on Israel from Lebanese territory are discussed in the article [[List of Lebanese rocket attacks on Israel]].  . 

==Other==. 
Israeli blacksmith Yaron Bob, from the village of [[Yated, Israel|Yated]], collects Palestinian rockets fired on his area and turns them into roses. These roses have been given by the Sderot Municipality to visiting dignitaries, including United Nations Secretary General [[Ban Ki-Moon]] and United States Senator [[John Kerry]]. [[Israel Police]] spokesman [[Micky Rosenfeld]] said, "those rockets are in fact rockets that kill, and it's a nice idea to turn them into flowers."<ref>[http://video.nytimes.com/video/2009/10/08/world/middleeast/1247465072600/turning-rockets-into-roses.html Turning Rockets Into Roses], New York Times (video)</ref> .
