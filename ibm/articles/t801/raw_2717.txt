====November 4 incident====. 
On November 4, 2008, Israel launched a military strike on Hamas to destroy what Israel said was a tunnel on the Gaza-Israel border dug by militants to infiltrate into Israel and abduct soldiers. According to Israel, the raid was not a violation of the ceasefire, but a legitimate step to remove an immediate threat. Israeli infantry, tanks, and bulldozers entered 250 m into the Gaza Strip, the first major incursion since the June truce. A gunfight broke out, in which one Hamas fighter was killed. Hamas responded with a barrage of mortar and rocket fire at Israeli troops. Three Israeli airstrikes on Hamas mortar and rocket positions then killed five Hamas fighters. According to eyewitnesses, another three Hamas fighters were wounded in an Israeli [[unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]] strike over the el-Burejj refugee camp. <ref name="Rockets fired after Gaza clashes" /> Three Israeli soldiers were also wounded during the operation. Hamas said it would take revenge for what it perceived as an act of Israeli aggression that had violated the truce. <ref name="Rockets fired after Gaza clashes">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7709603.stm Rockets fired after Gaza clashes], BBC, November 5, 2009</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/01/09/israel-rejected-hamas-cea_n_156639.html?show_comment_id=19558888|title=Israel Rejected Hamas Ceasefire Offer In December|last=Porter|first=Gareth |date=2009-01-09|work=Huffington Post|publisher=Inter Press Service|accessdate=2009-01-23}}</ref> Hamas launched 35 rockets into southern Israel in what was described by Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum as a "response to Israel's massive breach of the truce, stating that "The Israelis began this tension and they must pay an expensive price.

Israel began planning for a military operation as early as six months before the conflict by collecting intelligence on potential targets. The IDF also engaged in a disinformation campaign to give Hamas a false sense of security and to take them by surprise. Defense minister [[Ehud Barak]] stated that the offensive was the result of Israel’s "patience running out" over the rocket attacks. <ref>{{Cite news|title=Six months of secret planning – then Israel moves against Hamas|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/dec/29/israel-attack-hamas-preparations-repercussions|publisher=The Guardian|location=London|first=Ian|last=Black|date=2008-12-29|accessdate=2010-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|author=Barak Ravid|title=Disinformation, secrecy and lies: How the Gaza offensive came about |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1050426.html|publisher=Ha'aretz}}</ref> According to Israeli officials, its subsequent December 27 offensive took Hamas by surprise, thereby increasing militant casualties. <ref name=ravid>{{Cite news|first=Barak |last=Ravid|title=Disinformation, secrecy, deception: How the Gaza offensive came about |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1050426.html |publisher=Haaretz |date=December 27, 2008 |accessdate= December 27, 2008}}</ref> .

The [[Oketz Unit]], the IDF's dog-handling corps, performed 33 successful missions during the war, with specially-trained sniffer and attack dogs and their handlers leading advancing forces. In every mission that involved Oketz dogs, there were no casualties among soldiers.

The [[Givati Brigade]] penetrated the deepest into Gaza City. The brigade's reconnaissance battalion swept into the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood and took over two 15-story buildings in search of Hamas operatives two days before the cease fire went into effect. About 40 Palestinian fighters were killed during the operation. The commander of the brigade, Colonel Ilan Malka, was critical of Hamas's use of civilian houses and said that he "took many steps to prevent our soldiers from getting hurt." Malka told reporters that the IDF had initially predicted each battalion would lose six or seven soldiers. <ref name="A necessary operation">[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1249275681091&pagename=JPArticle%2FShowFull 'A necessary operation'], JPost, August 4, 2009</ref> . 

The Israeli government considered a third phase of the operation with the intent of dealing a "knock out blow" to Hamas. Military and intelligence assessments indicating that shifting the goal to destroying Hamas would require additional weeks of deep ground incursions into urban areas and refugee camps. This was expected to result in heavy casualties on both sides and among civilians, reduce the strong domestic support for the war, and increase international criticism. <ref name="Israeli Arsenal">{{Cite journal|last=Esposito|first=Michele K.|date=Spring 2009|title=Military Dimensions: The Israeli Arsenal Deployed against Gaza|publisher=Journal of Palestine Studies|volume= 38| issue = 3|pages= p. 175–191.|url=http://www.palestine-studies.org/files/pdf/jps/10341.pdf|issn=1533-8614|doi=10.1525/jps.2009.XXXVIII.3.175|journal=Journal of Palestine Studies}}</ref> .

====Palestinian Rockets in Gaza====. 
According to [[Human Right Watch]], On December 24, 2008 a rocket struck a bedroom of a family living in the [[Tel al-Hawa]] area in southern Gaza City critically wounding one man. The brother of this victim told after the incident no armed group came to apologize. “I was next door in my home when this all happened. When one of those responsible tried to bargain for the shrapnel, I said that if no one took responsibility I will go to the courts, so Hamas came to me privately and admitted it.” On December 26, 2008 a Palestinian rocket struck north of [[Beit Lahiya]], a house was hit killing two cousins and wounding another. The grandfather described the rocket as about one meter in length,  According to Human Rights Watch extermination the diameter of the pipe is 120&nbsp;mm. The grandfather said the rocket was taken by Hamas policemen for investigation: "After he left, the war started and we never heard from him again.

Egyptian mediators held discussions with Israel and Hamas about extending the cease-fire by a year or more. Hamas and Fatah met to allow both to play a role in rebuilding. <ref name="NYT0128">Kershner, Isabel and Ethan Bronner.

Retrieved on 2009-01-28. </ref> Israel began pressuring Egypt to do more to stop weapons smuggling into Gaza, the halting of which is one of Israel's central demands in extending a cease-fire. On 27 January 2009, [[Foreign Minister of Egypt]] [[Ahmed Aboul Gheit]] discouraged Britain, [[France]] and [[Germany]] from sending warships to patrol the waters off Gaza, which the three European nations felt could help halt seaborne smuggling. Gheit said such efforts would harm Europe's relations with the Arab world. Egypt also opposed proposals for European troops to be stationed on the border between Gaza and Egypt to monitor smuggling tunnels. <ref name="WP0128">Witte, Griff.

Israel, along with many Western and some Arab countries, wanted international aid groups to control aid from donations around the world, so that Hamas would not receive credit for the rebuilding. To speed up reconstruction, Hamas agreed that it would not insist on collecting reconstruction money itself and would allow donated money to flow through different avenues based on the various alliances, although Hamas ultimately expected to administer the aid. But advisors to senior Hamas political leader [[Ismail Haniyeh]] said Israel's willingness to open the border for humanitarian aid only was unacceptable, as Hamas would need much more to rebuild its economy and provide relief for citizens.

Shortly after becoming [[President of the United States]], [[Barack Obama]] directed newly appointed special envoy to the Middle East [[George J.

Mitchell began his meetings in Cairo on 27 January 2009 and Obama said his visit was part of the President's campaign promise to listen to both sides of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and work toward a Middle East peace deal. Mitchell did not plan to talk to Hamas, but instead focus on talks with the more moderate [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]]. <ref name="WP0128" /> A spokesman for Haniyeh said he respected Mitchell, but was disappointed with the envoy's decision not to hold discussions with Hamas. <ref name="NYT0128" /> .

Defense analyst David Eshel stated "that the success of Operation Cast Lead in the densely populated Gaza Strip shows that an industrial military that coordinates operations among land, air and sea units, makes effective use of advanced technology, and shares intelligence and leads from the front can decisively defeat an asymmetrical enemy." He further noted that "Israel used a variety of tactics to outflank and defeat Hamas in its own territory," including, "long-term planning, meticulous intelligence-gathering, deception and disinformation."<ref name='Aviation Week 2009-05-11'/> As a result of its poor performance, Hamas relieved at least two brigade commanders on Iranian advice, and reportedly stripped 100 fighters of their membership.

===Propaganda and psychological warfare===. 
====Hamas====. 
Before and during the conflict, Hamas' senior representatives released number of statements designed to avert Israeli decision-makers from launching any military operation in Gaza and to cause demoralization among Israelis. Before the end of the pre-conflict ceasefire, Hamas boasted that it had countless surprises awaiting Israeli troops, should they advance. <ref name="Psychological Tricks to Demoralize the Enemy">{{Cite news| title=Psychological Tricks to Demoralize the Enemy| url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,601694,00.html| publisher=[[Der Spiegel|Spiegel]]| date=January 16-2009}}</ref> Hamas representatives threatened on several occasions to abduct Israeli soldiers, and during the ground invasion tried to spread rumors that it actually had captured or killed more Israeli soldiers. <ref name="Israel's Gaza war adds psychological operations">{{cite web|author=6:25 p.m. ET |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28608585/ |title=Israel's Gaza war adds psychological operations, MSNBC, January 11, 2009 |publisher=MSNBC |date=2009-01-11 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}</ref> .

Hamas instrumentalized the abducted Israeli soldier [[Gilad Shalit]] as a form of psychological weapon, declaring that he had been wounded by Israeli fire, later announcing that his condition was no longer of interest to them. <ref name="Psychological Tricks to Demoralize the Enemy" /> . 

According to IDF spokesman, Hamas' ruses in the battlefield included booby traps throughout Gaza's neighborhoods, such as mannequins placed at apartment entrances and rigged to explode when the soldiers approach. <ref name="Israel's Gaza war adds psychological operations" /> . 

Arab television stations reported Hamas-provided statistics for Israeli casualties on the assumption that Israel is distorting its own figures of soldiers killed and wounded. <ref name="The unreported battle with Hamas: psychological warfare">[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1054916.html The unreported battle with Hamas: psychological warfare], Haaretz, Jan. 14, 2009</ref> . 

A study by the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] notes that Hamas propaganda both rejected Hamas responsibility for the fighting and used it to attack the Palestinian Authority. <ref name="AnthonyHCordesman" /> . 

Dr. Tal Pavel from Israeli think-tank [[International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism]] (ICT) said that Hamas uses its Web sites to make comparisons between Israel and Nazi Germany, portraying Israel as a destructive, oppressive regime afraid of Hamas rockets raining on Tel Aviv. <ref name="The unreported battle with Hamas: psychological warfare" /> . 

====Israel====. 
The day before the beginning of the offensive on December 27 the [[Israeli Defense Force]] (IDF) pulled troops back from the border and used its radio channels to broadcast talk of a "lull" to achieve a disinformation coup ("con") to lure Hamas fighters out of hiding. <ref name="ap-msnbc-psych-war">{{Cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28608585/|title=Israel's Gaza war adds psychological operations|date=2009-01-11|publisher=Associated Press via [[MSNBC]]|accessdate=2009-02-19}}</ref> . 

A broadcaster in Islamic Jihad's Voice of Jerusalem radio station in Gaza City reported that IDF have been breaking into his station signal "least once an hour" during conflict intensification to broadcast messages to Gaza population that their problems were due to Hamas. The army also dropped leaflets with similar messages and contact info to report about the whereabouts of militant leaders and weapons caches. <ref name="ap-msnbc-psych-war" /> The leaflets also noted that "the Israeli army will respond if the rocket fire continues."<ref name="guardian-psychwar">{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/03/israelandthepalestinians-middleeast |title= Text messages and phone calls add psychological aspect to warfare in Gaza|coauthors=Hazem Balousha in Gaza City and Toni O'Loughlin in Jerusalem |date=2009-01-03|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-02-12|location=London}}</ref> In war zones, leaflets warned local residents that they had to flee.

IDF spokespersons often reported that scores of demoralized Hamas fighters had been observed deserting. According to Ephraim Kam, deputy head of the Institute of National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, the claim could not be confirmed but it strengthened the Israeli population's will to continue and undermined the confidence in Hamas in Gaza. <ref name="Psychological Tricks to Demoralize the Enemy" /> . 

There was a mistrust of phone calls warning messages to people that they have "just minutes to evacuate before they bomb the house." According to a human rights lawyer at the [[Palestinian Center for Human Rights]] (PCHR), despite the hundreds of phone calls to families warning their house is about to be blown up, only 37 were destroyed, presumably as of the January 3 date. <ref name="guardian-psychwar" /> .

{{Main|Controversial tactics in the Gaza War}}
Both Israel and Hamas were accused of using controversial military tactics during the 2008–2009 Gaza War.  . 

===Controversial tactics allegedly used by Hamas=== . 

===Use of civilians as human shield=== . 

Israel maintains that Hamas uses civilians, and especially childrens, as [[human shield]], as a part of its war doctorine. 
The commander of the military-terrorist wing of the PFLP-GC in the Gaza Strip stated in an interview that some areas did not present a problem because of the "population and building density" that would "provide the resistance with a shield".

The [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] released a [[video]] taken by an [[UAV]] drone during the war purportedly showing a Hamas militant launching a rocket from a roof of a residential house and then leaving surrounded by children to avoid being targeted by the IDF. <ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vHDyuSTneA Cast Lead Video: Hamas Terrorist uses Children as Human Shield], [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] channel at [[YouTube]]. </ref>Later, the IDF and [[Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] compiled a film accusing Hamas of a systematical use of civilian infrastructure and civilians as a [[human shield]].

====Use of densely populated areas by Hamas combatants====. 
''[[The NY Times]]'' quotes a study published by the Israel-based [[Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center]], charging Hamas with methodically building its military infrastructure in the heart of population centers. According to the study, Hamas not only hides among the population, but has made a main component of its combat strategy "channeling" the army into the densely populated areas to fight. <ref name="nytimes_study">{{Cite news|title=Warnings Not Enough for Gaza Families |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/06/world/middleeast/06scene.html?_r=1&hp |date=January 5, 2009|publisher = New York Times|first1=Taghreed|last1=El-Khodary|first2=Isabel|last2=Kershner|accessdate=2010-04-02}}</ref>During the Gaza War, Hamas invested great effort in preventing civilians from leaving neighborhoods that were in the line of fire and letting them flee to the south of the Strip. <ref>{{cite web|last=Ya’ari|first=Ehud|title=Cracks in Hamas|url=http://www.jpost.com/JerusalemReport/Article.aspx?id=129784|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|accessdate=01/18/2009}}</ref>  . 

Israel accused Hamas of storing weapons in civilian facilities and protected places such as [[mosques]] and [[school]]s. In addition, Hamas [[booby-trap]]ped civilian building, schools and mosques as part of its battle plan against Israeli ground raid. On January 11th, 2009, the IDF released a video showing booby-trapped [[zoo]] and [[school]]. <ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI1q3etFX2k&feature=autoplay&list=PL8DA1957BBBC484DF&lf=plpp_video&playnext=1 Hamas Booby Trapped School and Zoo 11 Jan. 2009], IDF channel, [[YouTube]]. </ref> . 

After Israeli forces fired shells near a UN school in Gaza killing around 30 people, Israel's military said the shelling was in response to mortar fire from within the school and asserted that Hamas were using civilians as cover. They stated that the dead near the school included Hamas members of a rocket launching cell. Two residents of the area confirmed that a group of militants were firing mortar shells from near the school and identified two of the victims as Hamas militants. <ref>{{cite web|title=Israel OK's Gaza "Humanitarian Corridor"|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-202_162-4701206.html|publisher=CBS|accessdate=November 4, 2009}}</ref>  . 

On October 16, 2009 the former commander of the British forces in Afghanistan Col. Richard Kemp delivered a statement at UN Human Rights Council 12th Special Session. He testified:
{{cquote| During Operation Cast Lead, the Israeli Defense Forces did more to safeguard the rights of civilians in a combat zone than any other army in the history of warfare. Israel did so while facing an enemy that deliberately positioned its military capability behind the human shield of the civilian population. <ref>Goodenough, Patrick. (2009-10-16) [http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/55622 Israelis Took Unprecedented Steps to Safeguard Civilians, Says British Officer]. CNSnews.com.

Retrieved on 2011-06-18. </ref> }}
The Goldstone report stated that the:
{{cquote| Israeli Government has produced no visual or other evidence to support its allegation that Palestinian combatants “mingle routinely with civilians in order to cover their movements”. <ref name=UNFFMGCReport_pdf/> }}
The report concluded that although there were indications that Palestinian militants had fired rockets from urban areas they did not see any evidence that this was done with the intent of shielding themselves from counter strikes by the Israeli armed forces. The report notes that due to the densely populated nature of the Gaza strip, once the Israeli forces gained control of the outlying areas in the first few days of the ground invasion, most (if not all) the locations still accessible to the Palestinian militants would have been in urban areas. <ref name=UNFFMGCReport_pdf/> . 

====Use of medical facilities and uniforms by Hamas combatants==== . 

An IDF investigation concluded that Hamas forced the [[International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement|Red Crescent]] to hand over medic and nurse uniforms for its operatives and commandeered ambulances for fighters transportation during the War. Palestinian civilians living in Gaza detailed Hamas' attempts to hijack ambulances and the   wearing of paramedic uniforms by Hamas fighters. An ambulance driver registered with and trained by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society spoke of Hamas' efforts to "lure the ambulances into the heart of a battle to transport fighters to safety" and the hijacking of the al-Quds Hospital's fleet of ambulances. <ref name="Maximum 600 Palestinians died in Gaza">{{cite news| url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=130344| title=Maximum 600 Palestinians died in Gaza | date=2009-01-22| publisher= Jerusalem Post }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Katz|first=Yaakov|title=Haniyeh hid in hospital during Gaza op|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=139895|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|accessdate=2009-04-22}}</ref><ref name="Hamas tried to hijack ambulances during Gaza war">{{cite news| url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/hamas-tried-to-hijack-ambulances-during-war/2009/01/25/1232818246374.html| title= Hamas tried to hijack ambulances during Gaza war| date=2009-01-29| publisher=SMH}}</ref><ref name="Weighing Crimes and Ethics in the Fog of Urban Warfare">{{cite news| url= http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/17/world/middleeast/17israel.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all | title=Weighing Crimes and Ethics in the Fog of Urban Warfare | date=2009-01-16| publisher=The NY Times | first=Steven | last=Erlanger | accessdate=2010-04-02}}</ref>  . 

The IDF claimed that Hamas operated a command and control center inside [[Al-Shifa_Hospital|Shifa Hospital]] in Gaza City throughout the War, and that Hamas field commanders exploited the daily  cessation in fighting that the IDF established for humanitarian purposes to receive instructions from senior Hamas officials. Addressing the Israeli cabinet, an intelligence official claimed that senior members of Hamas sought refuge in the sub-level floors believing that Israel would not target them for fear that such a strike would invariably lead to heavy collateral damage to the hospital patients in the upper floors. <ref name= "shifa">Amos Harel, [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1054569.html Hamas leaders hiding in basement of Israel-built hospital in Gaza] Haaretz, 12 January 2009</ref>
Militants set up posts next to the hospital which were used for the firing of mortars. A tunnel leading to the maternity ward was discovered underneath a mosque that was located alongside the hospital which was used by Hamas operatives to move undetected. After an Israeli airstrike on the central prison which resulted in prisoners being released into the streets, several of the 115 prisoners accused of collaboration with Israel who had not yet been tried were executed by Hamas militants wearing civilian clothes in the Shifa hospital compound. <ref name="No Early End Seen to ‘All-Out War’ on Hamas in Gaza">[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/30/world/middleeast/30mideast.html?_r=3 No Early End Seen to ‘All-Out War’ on Hamas in Gaza] NY Times, December 29, 2008</ref>. <ref>{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Yaakov|title='10 Gazan hospitals used by Hamas in Cast Lead'|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=170992|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=03/15/2010}}</ref>  . 

The [[Intelligence_and_Terrorism_Information_Center|Intelligence and Terrorism Information Centre]] reported that Hamas made extensive use of the Al-Fahoura Medical Centre and that they established a military camp and training base next to it. The ITIC released aerial pictures showing tunnels dug around the building and the medical centre and that the area surrounding the hospital was heavily mined. Rockets were launched in close proximity of the centre. The ITIC report stated that Hamas used 10 Gazan hospitals for launching rockets at Israeli towns and for attacking IDF troops. <ref>{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Yaakov|title='10 Gazan hospitals used by Hamas in Cast Lead'|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=170992|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=03/15/2010}}</ref>  . 

Hamas also set up a command centre within a children’s hospital located in the Nasser neighbourhood of Gaza City which was used by top Hamas leadership on the night of December 27. Senior Hamas commanders also set up a command center in a Red Crescent Society clinic in Khan Yunis. <ref>{{cite web|last=Katz|first=Yaakov|title=Haniyeh hid in hospital during Gaza op|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=139895|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|accessdate=2009-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Yaakov|title='10 Gazan hospitals used by Hamas in Cast Lead'|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=170992|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=03/15/2010}}</ref>  .

On January 12 it was reported that more than 50 phosphorus burns victims were in Nasser Hospital. On January 16 the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East|UNRWA]] headquarters was hit with phosphorus munitions. <ref name="Israel admits using white phosphorus in attacks on Gaza" /> As a result of the hit, the compound was set ablaze. <ref name="Israel reprimands top officers over UN compound strike" /> On completion of the three-day Israeli withdrawal (January 21) an Israeli military spokeswoman said that shells containing phosphorus had been used in Gaza but said that they were used legally as a method to provide a smokescreen. <ref name="Israel admits using white phosphorus in attacks on Gaza">[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article5575070.ece "Israel admits using white phosphorus in attacks on Gaza"] The Times January 24, 2009. </ref> The IDF reiterated their position on January 13 saying that it used weapons "in compliance with international law, while strictly observing that they be used according to the type of combat and its characteristics."<ref>{{cite web|last=Press |first=Associated |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1231866575577&pagename=JPArticle%2FShowFull |title='IDF white phosphorus use not illegal' |publisher=Fr.jpost.com |accessdate=2010-03-24}}</ref> On March 25, 2009, [[USA]] Based Human Rights Organization [[Human Rights Watch]] published a 71 page report titled Rain of Fire, ''Israel’s Unlawful Use of White Phosphorus in Gaza'' and said that Israel's usage of the weapon was illegal. <ref name=RainofFire>[http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2009/03/25/rain-fire Rain of Fire, ''Israel’s Unlawful Use of White Phosphorus in Gaza'' (2009)] [http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/iopt0309webwcover.pdf PDF]</ref> Donatella Rovera, Amnesty’s researcher on Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories said that such extensive use of this weapon in Gaza's densely populated residential neighbourhoods is inherently indiscriminate. "Its repeated use in this manner, despite evidence of its indiscriminate effects and its toll on civilians, is a war crime," she said. <ref>[http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/israeli-armys-use-white-phosphorus-gaza-clear-undeniable-20090119 Israel used white phosphorus in Gaza civilian areas]. Amnesty International (19 January 2009) Retrieved 30th May 2011</ref> The Goldstone report accepted that white phosphorus is not illegal under international law but did find that the Israelis were "systematically reckless in determining its use in built-up areas". It also called for serious consideration to be given to the banning of its use as an obscurant. <ref name="Goldstone Report" /> . 

After watching footage of Israeli troop deployments on television, a British soldier who completed numerous combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan with the Intelligence Corps defended the Israeli Army's use of white phosphorus. The soldier noted, "White phosphorus is used because it provides an instant smokescreen, other munitions can provide a smokescreen but the effect is not instant. Faced with overwhelming enemy fire and wounded comrades, every commander would choose to screen his men instantly, to do otherwise would be negligent."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/3286561/a-british-soldiers-view-of-operation-cast-lead.thtml |title=A British soldier's view of Operation Cast Lead |publisher=Spectator.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-05}}</ref> . 

Colonel Lane, a military expert testifying in front of the fact-finding mission in July 2009, told that white phosphorus is used for smoke generation to hide from the enemy. He stated that "the quality of smoke produced by white phosphorus is superb; if you want real smoke for real coverage, white phosphorus will give it to you". <ref name="Public hearings – Geneva, Afternoon Session of 7 July 2009">[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/2009.07.07PM_Session.doc Public hearings – Geneva, Afternoon Session of 7 July 2009], UNHRC</ref> Professor Newton, expert in laws of armed conflict testifying in front of the committee, said that in an urban area, where potential perils are snipers, explosive devices and trip wires, one effective way to mask forces' movement is by white phosphorus. In certain cases, he added, such choice of means would be less harmful for civilian population than other munitions, provided that the use of white phosphorus withstands the proportionality test. In discussing the principle of proportionality he said that the legality of using white phosphorus in an urban setting could only be decided on a case by case basis taking into account "the precise circumstances of its use, not in general, generically, but based on that target, at that time". He stressed that the humanitarian implications were vital in this assessment giving the example that using white phosphorus on a school yard would have different implications to its use on another area. He also said that in his view white phosphorus munition is neither chemical nor incendiary weapon. <ref name="Public hearings – Geneva, Afternoon Session of 7 July 2009"/> . 

An article by Mark Cantora examining the legal implications of the use of white phosphorus munitions by the IDF, published in 2010 in the [[Gonzaga Journal of International Law]], argues that Israel's use of White Phosphorus in Gaza was technically legal under existing international humanitarian laws and "Therefore, it is imperative for the international community to convene a White Phosphorus Convention Conference in order to address these issues and fill this substantial gap in international humanitarian law."<ref>Mark Cantora, Israel and White Phosphorus During Operation Cast Lead: A Case Study in Adherence to Inadequate Humanitarian Laws, 13:1 Gonzaga Journal of International Law (2010), available at http://www.gonzagajil.org/content/view/194/26/</ref> . 

====Dense inert metal explosives====. 
[[Dense Inert Metal Explosive]] (DIME) is a type of bomb developed to minimize collateral damage. <ref name="Israel used new type of weapon in Gaza">[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1056649.html Israel used new type of weapon in Gaza], Haaretz, January 20, 2009</ref> DIME is a relatively new weapons technology being developed mainly in the United States. Several studies, including the one of [[Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute]], indicate that the tungsten residuals of the DIME weapon in the muscles of the laboratory animals result in severe malignant carcinogenesis. It is yet to be seen if this will have the same effect in humans. <ref>[http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/press/011505.html Tungsten-Alloy Shrapnel Causes Tumors, Cancer in Rats] Environmental Health Perspectives Website 2005-02-16 Retrieved 2010-02-24</ref> Because of possible high inclination to develop cancerous tumors in humans, some argue that the use of tungsten in weapons may be more dangerous than depleted uranium. <ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18524883.700-depleted-uranium-ammo-may-be-replaced.html Depleted uranium ammo may be replaced] New Scientist Website 2005-02-26 Retrieved 2010-02-24</ref> . 

Norwegian doctors who were one of the few Europeans in Gaza City during the conflict and a military expert working for [[Human Rights Watch]] said judging by the nature of the wounds and descriptions given by Gazans made it seem likely that Israel used DIME weapons. <ref name="Israel used new type of weapon in Gaza" /> . 

Colonel Lane, military expert testifying in front of the fact-finding mission in July 2009, told the committee that there is no actual proof that DIME rounds were used, but he is of view that some weapons systems used in the conflict had some sort of DIME component, citing evidence of tungsten, iron, and sulfur in samples analyzed in a forensic lab. Colonel Lane explained that the idea behind a Focused Lethality Munition (FLM), which is an example of a DIME munition, is that the fragments produced stay within a safety radius of about 6 meters, so anybody outside that radius is reasonably safe, while those within the area of dispersal will experience catastrophic injuries, possibly leading to multiple amputations. He commented on the documentations where medics described unusual amputations saying that the use of a metal like tungsten and cobalt at short distances would likely had that effect. <ref name="Public hearings – Geneva, Afternoon Session of 7 July 2009">[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/2009.07.07PM_Session.doc OHCHR.org]</ref> . 

The [[Goldstone Report]] wrote that the Mission found that the allegations that DIME weapons were 
used Israeli armed forces required further clarification and they were unable to ascertain their usage, though it received reports from Palestinian and foreign doctors who had operated in Gaza during the military operations of a high percentage of patients with injuries compatible with their impact. It stated that the "focused lethality" reportedly pursued in DIME weapons could be seen as enhancing compliance with the principle of distinction between civilian and 
military objects. The report added that as it currently stands, DIME weapons and weapons armed with heavy metal are not prohibited under international law, but do raise specific health concerns. <ref name="Goldstone Report">[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/12session/A-HRC-12-48.pdf Goldstone report], Goldstone report, UNHRC, para. 49</ref> . 

An Amnesty International report called on Israel to confirm or deny its use of DIME in order to facilitate the treatment of those injured in the conflict. In amnesty's view as a new weapon, more research is needed to asses whether the use of DIME is lawful under international law. <ref name="AA">[http://www.amnesty.org/es/library/asset/MDE15/012/2009/es/3301b5c0-189b-4ba2-9bca-68e116fd590f/mde150122009en.pdf Fuelling conflict: foreign arms supplies to israel/gaza], Amnesty International, pp 17</ref> .

=====Prosecutions=====. 
The first Israeli soldier to be prosecuted for actions committed during the war was a [[Givati Brigade]] soldier who stole a Visa credit card from a Palestinian home and used it to withdraw [[Israeli new shekel|NIS]] 1,600 ([[United States dollar|$]]405). He was arrested and tried before the Southern Command Military Court on charges of looting, credit card fraud, and indecent conduct.

In October 2010, Colonel Ilan Malka was interrogated by [[Military Police Corps (Israel)|Israeli military police]] over the [[Zeitoun incident]], and a criminal investigation was opened.

The IDF said that the officer "failed to exercise appropriate judgement", and that he would not be allowed to serve in similar positions of command in the future. Another Israeli officer was also reprimanded for allowing a Palestinian man to enter a building to persuade Hamas militants sheltering inside to leave. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/07/world/middleeast/07mideast.html|work=The New York Times|first=Isabel|last=Kershner|title=Indictments in Gaza War Are Announced|date=2010-07-06}}</ref> . 

In November 2010, two Givati Brigade Staff Sergeants were convicted by the Southern Command Military Court of using a Palestinian boy as a human shield. The soldiers had been accused of forcing nine year-old Majed R. at gunpoint to open bags suspected of containing bombs in the [[Tel al-Hawa]] neighborhood. Both soldiers were demoted one rank and given three-month suspended sentences. <ref name="HRW"/> . 

According to the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]]'s 2010 Human Rights Report, the [[Military Advocate General]] investigated over 150 wartime incidents, including those mentioned in the Goldstone Report. As of July, the Military Advocate General launched 47 criminal investigations into the conduct of IDF personnel, and completed a significant number of those. <ref>http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154463.htm</ref> . 

On April 1, 2011, Judge [[Richard Goldstone]], the lead author of the UN report on the conflict, published a piece in the [[Washington Post]] titled 'Reconsidering the Goldstone Report on Israel and war crimes'. Goldstone noted that the subsequent investigations conducted by Israel "indicate that civilians were not intentionally targeted as a matter of policy" while "the crimes allegedly committed by Hamas were intentional goes without saying." He further expressed regret "that our fact-finding mission did not have such evidence explaining the circumstances in which we said civilians in Gaza were targeted, because it probably would have influenced our findings about intentionality and war crimes.". <ref name="WP0401">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/reconsidering-the-goldstone-report-on-israel-and-war-crimes/2011/04/01/AFg111JC_story.html|title=Reconsidering the Goldstone Report on Israel and war crimes' |publisher=''[[Washington Post]]''|date=2011-04-01|author=Richard Goldstone|accessdate=2011-04-01}}</ref> The other principal authors of the UN report, [[Hina Jilani]], [[Christine Chinkin]] and [[Desmond Travers]], have rejected Goldstone's reassessment arguing that there is "no justification for any demand or expectation for reconsideration of the report as nothing of substance has appeared that would in anyway change the context, findings or conclusions of that report with respect to any of the parties to the Gaza conflict". <ref name="afp1404">{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iAXwmnGEbQBBCvdn82UdbTFpnECA?docId=CNG.81e3f073a7ff60182e936e010de882cd.791|title=Authors reject calls to retract Goldstone report on Gaza|date=2011-04-14|publisher=AFP|accessdate=17 April 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5y0OWze1n|archivedate=2011-04-17}}</ref><ref name="g2011-04-14">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/apr/14/goldstone-report-statement-un-gaza|title=Goldstone report: Statement issued by members of UN mission on Gaza war|coauthors=Hina Jilani, Christine Chinkin and Desmond Travers|date=2011-04-14|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=17 April 2011|location=London}}</ref> .

Along with a high casualty rate, there were multiple economic, industrial and medical effects of the Gaza War.

[[Human Rights Watch]] stated that police are presumptively civilians but on a specific case by case basis can be considered valid targets if formally incorporated into the armed forces of a party to a conflict or directly participate in the hostilities. They stressed that blanket decisions must not be made about police being legitimate targets and that a decision that police and police stations are legitimate military targets depends on whether those police play a role in fighting against Israel, or whether a particular police station is used to store weapons or for some other military purpose. <ref name="hrw_civilians_release">{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/12/30/israelgaza-civilians-must-not-be-targets|title=Israel/Gaza: Civilians must not be tagets|date=2008-12-30|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref> The IDF made clear that it regards police under the control of Hamas in Gaza to be equivalent to the enemies armed fighters, including them in the militant's count.

The policy of the Government of Israel is to condition the access of Palestinians who live in the Palestinian territories to healthcare in Israel upon financial coverage from the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]].

===Reactions in Israel=== . 

The war provoked mixed reactions inside Israel, with the Jewish majority largely supporting it, and the Arab minority mostly opposing it. A poll taken on January 8, 2009, showed that 91% of the Jewish public supported the war, and 4% opposed it, while a separate poll conducted from January 4–6 showed a 94% approval of the war among Jews and 85% disapproval among Israeli Arabs. <ref name="INSS">[http://www.inss.org.il/publications.php?cat=21&incat=&read=2634 המכון למחקרי ביטחון לאומי > Publications > Periodicals]. INSS. Retrieved on 2011-06-18. </ref> . 

During the war, Arab protests took place across the country. Within hours of the war's start, the Higher Follow-Up Committee for Arab citizens of Israel met in [[Nazareth]], and declared a "day of wrath and mourning for the martyrs among our compatriots in the Gaza Strip", and a general strike for the following day. Arab demonstrations took place across the country almost every day during the offensive, and were described as the "largest Arab demonstrations in Israel's history". Arab parties and parliamentarians in the [[Knesset]] also opposed the offensive. <ref>[http://www.palestine-studies.org/files/pdf/jps/10332.pdf The Palestinians in Israel and Operation Cast lead: A view from Haifa]. palestine-studies.org</ref><ref name="Massacre Claims 3">[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2009/01/2009110134856498809.html Mass protests held against Gaza war].

Police arrested dozens of rioters. At the [[University of Haifa]], [[Tel Aviv University]] and the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], Jewish leftist and Arab students staged anti-war demonstrations, which were met with pro-war counter-demonstrations. Some confrontations occurred despite police keeping protesters apart. <ref>http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/129097</ref> . 

The legal rights agency [[Adalah]] produced a report that was highly critical of the Israeli police and court system's response to the opposition to Operation Cast lead within Israel. The report said that the Israeli authorities had shown a lack of toleration for protests, and had damaged the freedom of expression of those opposing the attacks on Gaza. The report stated that the actions showed the lessons of the [[Or Commission]] had not been learned. The Israeli Ministry of Justice responded that the risk to human life and public welfare had justified their actions. <ref>{{Cite news|title=How Israel silenced its Gaza war protesters|publisher=Haaretz|author=Akiva Eldar|date=22.09.09|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/how-israel-silenced-its-gaza-war-protesters-1.7477}}</ref> .
