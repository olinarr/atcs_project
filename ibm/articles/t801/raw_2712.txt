The '''United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict''', known as the '''Goldstone Report''', was a team established in April 2009 by the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] (UNHRC) during the [[Gaza War]] (January 2009) as an independent international fact-finding mission to investigate alleged violations of [[international human rights law]] and [[international humanitarian law]] in the [[Palestinian territories]], particularly the [[Gaza Strip]], in connection with [[Gaza War]]. <ref name=resolution>[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/A-HRC-S-9-2.doc REPORT OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL ON ITS NINTH SPECIAL SESSION], UNHCR, 27 February 2009</ref> South African jurist [[Richard Goldstone]] was appointed to head the mission. <ref name=resolution/><ref name="UNHRCOfficialPage">[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/FactFindingMission.htm United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict].

Israel refused to cooperate with the report, which was released on September 15, 2009. The report accused both the [[Israel Defense Forces]] and the [[Palestinian militants]] of [[war crime]]s and possible [[crimes against humanity]]. It recommended that the sides openly investigate their own conduct and if they failed to do so, to bring the allegations to the [[International Criminal Court]]. <ref name=UNFFMGCReport_pdf>{{cite news|url=http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2009/09/15/UNFFMGCReport.pdf|title=Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict|publisher=United Nations Human Rights Council|accessdate=15 September 2009 | location=London}}</ref><ref name="UN condemns 'war crimes' in Gaza">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8257301.stm UN condemns 'war crimes' in Gaza], [[BBC]], 15 September 2009</ref> The government of [[Israel]] rejected the report as prejudiced and full of errors, and also sharply rejected the charge that it had a policy of deliberately targeting civilians. <ref>[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1251804580173 'Syria, Somalia can't preach morality'] 16 September 2009</ref> The militant Islamic group [[Hamas]] initially rejected some of the report's findings,<ref name="Chinaview">[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-10/08/content_12195495.htm ''Hamas drafts responses to its accusations in Goldstone report&#91;http://www.ceia-sc.org/page37/page175/page175.html Goldstone Report&#93;'']</ref> but then urged world powers to embrace it. <ref name="Haniyeh: World must back Goldstone's Gaza report">[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=226956 Haniyeh: World must back Goldstone's Gaza report], Ma'an, 20 September 2009. </ref> .

On April 1, 2011, Goldstone retracted his claim that it was Israeli government policy to deliberately target citizens, saying "While the investigations published by the Israeli military and recognized in the U.N. committee’s report have established the validity of some incidents that we investigated in cases involving individual soldiers, they also indicate that civilians were not intentionally targeted as a matter of policy."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/reconsidering-the-goldstone-report-on-israel-and-war-crimes/2011/04/01/AFg111JC_story.html | work=The Washington Post | date=1 April 2011 | first=Kathleen | last=Parker}}</ref>  On the 14th of April 2011 the three other co authors of the United Nations (UN) fact-finding mission on the Gaza conflict of 2008-2009 [[Hina Jilani]], [[Christine Chinkin]] and [[Desmond Travers]] released a joint statement criticizing Goldstone's recantation of this aspect of the report.

==Mandate of mission==. 
On January 3, 2009, in response to the [[Gaza War]], the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]]'s executive committee asked the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to send a fact-finding mission to Gaza. <ref name="'OIC initiated Goldstone inquiry'">[http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/10/20091021112649368100.html 'OIC initiated Goldstone inquiry'], Al Jazeera, 28 October 2009</ref> On January 12, the council adopted Resolution S-9/1, deciding "to dispatch an urgent, independent international fact-finding mission, to be appointed by the President of the Council, to investigate all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law by the occupying Power, Israel, against the Palestinian people throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly in the occupied Gaza Strip, due to the current aggression, and calls upon Israel not to obstruct the process of investigation and to fully cooperate with the mission"<ref name=resolution>[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/A-HRC-S-9-2.doc REPORT OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL ON ITS NINTH SPECIAL SESSION], UNHCR, 27 February 2009. </ref> Upon being asked to lead the Mission, former [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] [[Mary Robinson]] expressed disappointment with the mandate and refused to head the Mission for that reason. She stated that the resolution adopted by UN Human Rights Council was one-sided and "guided not by human rights but by politics." She later expressed full support for the report. <ref>[http://www.theelders.org/media/news/accounting-gaza Accounting for Gaza, Mary Robinson, 30 September 2009]</ref>  Richard Goldstone initially refused the appointment for the same reason, calling the mandate "biased" and "uneven-handed." In January 2011, Goldstone said that the UNHRC "repeatedly rush to pass condemnatory resolutions in the face of alleged violations of human rights law by Israel but fail to take similar action in the face of even more serious violations by other States. Until the Gaza Report they failed to condemn the firing of rockets and mortars at Israeli civilian centers."<ref>[http://www.americanthinker.com/2011/02/judge_goldstone_contradicts_th.html Judge Goldstone Contradicts the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]</ref> . 

Following Goldstone's objection, the mandate was informally widened to cover activities by Palestinian militants as well, and this was the formulation quoted by the final report. <ref name="UNHRCOfficialPage"/><ref name="Goldstone_BBC">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8076690.stm|title =Goldstone's UN inquiry team arrives in Gaza|date=1 June 2009|accessdate=4 June 2009|publisher=BBC}}</ref> Its mandate was "to investigate all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law that might have been committed at any time in the context of the military operations that were conducted in Gaza during the period from 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009, whether before, during or after. 
Speaking at [[Brandeis University]], Goldstone noted that the widened mandate was presented by the president of the UNHRC to a plenary session, where it did not encounter a single objection. <ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtbHifKM6sM&feature=player_embedded Goldstone in remarks at Brandeis university, cf. 08:30]</ref> He later described as "tiresome and inept" allegations forwarded by [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] that the mandate had not been broadened to cover violations by all parties. <ref name="ipsnews.net"/> . 

Despite Ambassador Martin Uhomoibhi's verbal commitment that there was no objection to the revised mandate,<ref>{{cite news|title=Goldstone: Israel should cooperate|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=148974|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=2009-07-16}}</ref> the Human Rights Council never voted to revise the mandate, and resolution S-9/1 remained unchanged. <ref>[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/A-HRC-S-91-L1.doc Text of Resolution S-9/1 - the appointment of the mission followed the adoption on 12 January 2009]</ref> . 

==Mission members==. 
According to the mission's report, "The President appointed Justice [[Richard Goldstone]], former judge of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa]] and former Prosecutor of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia]] and [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda|Rwanda]], to head the Mission. The other three appointed members were: [[Christine Chinkin]], Professor of International Law at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]], who took part in a fact-finding mission to [[Beit Hanoun]] in 2008; [[Hina Jilani]], Advocate of the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] and a member of the International [[Commission of Inquiry on Darfur]] in 2004; and [[Desmond Travers]], a former colonel in the [[Irish Defence Forces]] and member of the Board of Directors of the [[Institute for International Criminal Investigations]]." . 

Richard J. Goldstone is a former South African [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] [[judge]] and served as the chief prosecutor of the United Nations International Criminal Tribunals [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|for the former Yugoslavia]] and [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda|for Rwanda]]. <ref name="RICHARD J. GOLDSTONE APPOINTED TO LEAD HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL FACT-FINDING MISSION ON GAZA CONFLICT">[http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/0/2796E2CA43CA4D94C125758D002F8D25?opendocument RICHARD J. GOLDSTONE APPOINTED TO LEAD HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL FACT-FINDING MISSION ON GAZA CONFLICT], UNHRC, 3 April 2009</ref> . 

[[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) applauded the selection of Goldstone to head the mission, saying that "Justice Goldstone's reputation for fairness and integrity is unmatched, and his investigation provides the best opportunity to address alleged violations by both Hamas and Israel". <ref>{{cite web|author=Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch |url=http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/05/17/us-ask-israel-cooperate-goldstone-inquiry |title=US: Ask Israel to Cooperate with Goldstone Inquiry &#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=17 May 2009 |accessdate=17 October 2009}}</ref> Goldstone was a board member of HRW at that time,<ref>[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/Bios_Gaza_FMM.doc Biographical information of the members]</ref> which HRW noted in their article.  [[Gerald Steinberg]] of the Jerusalem-based [[NGO Monitor]] and journalist [[Melanie Phillips]] said that even though Goldstone resigned from HRW after the inquiry began, his impartiality was compromised by his link to an organization that accused Israel of war crimes. <ref name="NGO Monitor: Gaza war probe tainted by anti-Israel ideology">[http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1113207.html NGO Monitor: Gaza war probe tainted by anti-Israel ideology], ''Haaretz,'' Sept 08 2009</ref><ref name="From Gulag Liberators to Saudi Retainers">[http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NjNkYzBhMWNjZTNhZmY3ZDc3N2FhM2ViMzE5ODQ3ZWE From Gulag Liberators to Saudi Retainers], NRO, 21 July 2009</ref><ref name="The Goldstone show-trial">[http://www.spectator.co.uk/melaniephillips/5322971/the-goldstone-showtrial.thtml The Goldstone show-trial], Spectator, September 11, 2009</ref> . 

In March 2009, Goldstone, Travers and Jilani signed an open letter to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the United Nations Security Council, calling for those who perpetrated "gross violations of the laws of war," "gross violations of international humanitarian law" and "targeting of civilians" to be brought to account. The letter concluded: "The events in Gaza have shocked us to the core. Relief and reconstruction are desperately needed but, for the real wounds to heal, we must also establish the truth about crimes perpetuated against civilians on both sides."<ref name="Gaza investigators call for war crimes inquiry ">[http://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/20572/ Gaza investigators call for war crimes inquiry] Amnesty International, 16 March 2009</ref> The chief rabbi of South Africa [[Warren Goldstein]] and Melanie Phillips asserted that this statement, made before the work of the mission has begun, violated provisions for impartiality of the fact-finding missions. <ref name="The Goldstone show-trial"/><ref name="It looks like law, but it's just politics">[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?apage=1&cid=1255450652253&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull It looks like law, but it's just politics], JPost, 15 October 2009</ref> Mary Robinson called Goldstone "a dedicated and unimpeachable human rights lawyer and advocate" who "was able to work with the [Human Rights] Council’s president to secure an agreement that he felt confident would permit the mandate to be interpreted in such a way as to allow his team to address the actions taken by both parties to the conflict."<ref>[http://www.theelders.org/media/news/accounting-gaza Accounting for Gaza], [[Mary Robinson]], 30 September 2009</ref> . 

In January 2009, before her appointment to the mission, [[Christine Chinkin]] co-signed a letter published in the ''[[Sunday Times]]'' describing Israel's military offensive in Gaza as "an act of aggression."  The letter also stated that the firing of rockets by Hamas into Israel and [[Palestinian political violence|suicide bombings]] are "contrary to international humanitarian law and are war crimes."<ref name="Analysis: The problem with Goldstone"/><ref name="Israel’s bombardment of Gaza is not self-defence – it’s a war crime">[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/letters/article5488380.ece Israel’s bombardment of Gaza is not self-defence – it’s a war crime], The Sunday Times, 11 January 2009. </ref>  Critics, among them [[Howard L.

==Investigation==. 
The mission convened on 4 May in Geneva and during a week-long session held meetings with UN Member States, NGOs and representatives of the UN. By the end of the session, the mission established its methodology and a three-month program of work. <ref name="UNHRCOfficialPage"/> The mission issued a press release on 8 May describing the mandate, progress and plans. Goldstone stated that the focus of the investigation would be on "an objective and impartial analysis of compliance of the parties to the conflict with their obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law, especially their responsibility to ensure the protection of civilians and non-combatants," adding "I believe that an objective assessment of the issues is in the interests of all parties, will promote a culture of accountability and could serve to promote greater peace and security in the region."<ref name="UN FACT-FINDING MISSION ON THE GAZA CONFLICT HOLDS FIRST MEETING IN GENEVA">[http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/BC7C60F307A16D1BC12575B000315895?opendocument UN FACT-FINDING MISSION ON THE GAZA CONFLICT HOLDS FIRST MEETING IN GENEVA], UN, 8 May 2009</ref> . 

On June 8, the mission invited "all interested persons and organizations to submit relevant information and documentation that will assist in the implementation of the Mission's mandate." Submissions were to focus on "events and conduct that occurred in the context of the armed conflict that took place between 27 December 2008 and 19 January 2009" and that "for the purposes of its mandate, events since June 2008 are particularly relevant to the conflict."<ref name="UNHRCOfficialPage"/><ref name="Call for Submissions">[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/call_for_submissions.doc Call for Submissions], UN, 8 June 2009</ref> . 

The mission conducted two field visits to Gaza, entering through the [[Rafah Border Crossing]] from [[Egypt]] after access through Israel was denied. The first visit, on June 1–5, 2009, included a tour of the sites and interviews with victims and witnesses. Investigations continued during the second visit, from 26 June to 1 July, with public hearings. <ref name="UNHRCOfficialPage"/> In the course of the investigation, the committee conducted 188 interviews, reviewed 10,000 pages of documents and inspected 1,200 photographs. <ref name="Inquiry Finds Gaza War Crimes From Both Sides">[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/16/world/middleeast/16gaza.html?hpw Inquiry Finds Gaza War Crimes From Both Sides"], NY Times, 15 September 2009. </ref> . 

Israel refused to cooperate with the investigation, [[Alleged United Nations bias in Israel-Palestine issues|citing anti-Israel bias]] in the UNHRC and the mission's one-sided founding resolution.

The commission's report states that during and after the investigation, several Palestinians cooperating with the Mission were detained by Israeli security forces. One of them was [[Muhammad Srour]], a member of the Popular Committee Against the Wall in [[Nilin]], who testified before the Mission in Geneva; en-route back to West Bank he was arrested. After UN intervention, he was released. Israeli security sources said that Sruor was detained for questioning on suspicion that he was involved in terror activity and that his visit to Geneva had no bearing on the arrest. <ref name="Palestinian arrested after testifying in Geneva">[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3750927,00.html Palestinian arrested after testifying in Geneva], YNET, 22 July 2009</ref> Another witness, [[Shawan Jabarin]], General Director of the Palestinian human-rights organisation [[Al Haq]], had to be heard by videoconference, as he has been subject to a travel ban by Israel since 2006 preventing him from leaving the West Bank on the grounds that he is a senior member of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]]. <ref name="HCJ152009">{{cite web|url=http://www.alhaq.org/pdfs/Shawan-abarin-v.pdf|title=Shawan Rateb Abdullah Jabarin (The Petitioner) – Versus – The Commander of IDF Forces in the West Bank (The Respondent)|date=10 February 2009|publisher=[[Israeli High Court of Justice]]|accessdate=12 April 2009}}</ref><ref name="alhaq.org">http://www.alhaq.org/etemplate.php?id=438 Dutch Foreign Minister Condemns Travel Ban Imposed by Israel on Al-Haq General Director.

==Report==. 
On September 15, 2009, a 574 page report was released. <ref>[http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2009/09/15/UNFFMGCReport.pdf "Human Rights in Palestine and Other Occupied Arab Territories: Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict"]</ref>
The report concluded that the [[Israel Defence Force]] (IDF) and Palestinian militant groups had committed war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity. While the report condemned violations by both sides, it differentiated between the moral and legal severity of the violations of the Israeli forces compared to those of Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups. <ref name=deen>{{citenews|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=48448|auote=The U.N. team, led by Justice Richard Goldstone, says there is also evidence that Palestinian armed groups, specifically Hamas, committed war crimes in their repeated mortar attacks on civilians on southern Israel... But its strongest indictment is against the state of Israel, which is accused of imposing a blockade on Gaza "amounting to collective punishment" carried out as part of a "systematic policy of progressive isolation and deprivation of the Gaza Strip".|publisher=[[Inter Press Service]]|accessdate=16 October 2009|title=POLITICS: U.N.

From the facts gathered, the Mission found that the following grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention were committed by Israeli forces in Gaza: wilful killing, torture or inhuman treatment, willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health, and extensive destruction of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly. As grave breaches these acts give rise to individual criminal responsibility. The Mission notes that the use of human shields also constitutes a war crime under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court."]
</ref> Goldstone stated that the mission "wasn’t an investigation, it was a fact-finding mission” and that the conclusion that war crimes had been committed "was always intended as conditional". He described the allegations as "a useful road map" for independent investigations by Israel and the Palestinians. <ref name="Goldstone: ‘If This Was a Court Of Law, There Would Have Been Nothing Proven.’">[http://www.forward.com/articles/116269/ Goldstone: ‘If This Was a Court Of Law, There Would Have Been Nothing Proven.’], The Forward, 16 October 2009</ref> He later added that the mission did not conduct a judicial investigation, and stated that its findings did not amount to "the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt". He described it as a [[prima facie]] case, "reasonable on weighing the evidence" and said that the information obtained would not be admissible as evidence in a criminal court. <ref name=push>[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1255694848458&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull 'Probe by Israel would stop UN push'], JPost, 20 October 2009</ref> . 

==Accusations against Israel==. 
===Blockade of Gaza allegations===. 
{{Main|2007–present blockade of the Gaza Strip}}
The report stated that the blockade constituted a violation of Israel's obligations as an occupying power in Gaza. <ref>p. 276ff</ref> . 

===Civilian targeting allegations===. 
The report disputes Israel's claim that the Gaza war would have been conducted as a response to rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, saying that at least in part the war was targeted against the "people of Gaza as a whole". Intimidation against the population was seen as an aim of the war. 
. <ref>[http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2009/09/15/UNFFMGCReport.pdf "1680. The Gaza military operations were, according to the Israeli Government, thoroughly and extensively planned. While the Israeli Government has sought to portray its operations as essentially a response to rocket attacks in the exercise of its right to self defence, the Mission considers the plan to have been directed, at least in part, at a different target: the people of Gaza as a whole."]</ref> The report also says that Israel’s military assault on Gaza was designed to "humiliate and terrorize a civilian population, radically diminish its local economic capacity both to work and to provide for itself, and to force upon it an ever increasing sense of dependency and vulnerability”. <ref name="Inquiry Finds Gaza War Crimes From Both Sides"/> . 

The report focused on 36 cases that it said constituted a representative sample. In 11 of these episodes, it said the Israeli military carried out direct attacks against civilians, including some in which civilians were shot “while they were trying to leave their homes to walk to a safer place, waving white flags”. <ref name="Inquiry Finds Gaza War Crimes From Both Sides"/> Talking to [[Bill Moyers Journal]], Goldstone said that the committee chose 36 incidents that represented the highest death toll, where there seemed to be little or no military justification for what happened. <ref>[http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/10232009/watch.html BILL MOYERS vs RICHARD GOLDSTONE]</ref> According to the report, another alleged war crime committed by IDF include “wanton” destruction of food production, water and sewerage facilities; the report also asserts that some attacks, which were supposedly aimed to kill small number of combatants amidst significant numbers of civilians, were disproportionate. <ref name="Inquiry Finds Gaza War Crimes From Both Sides"/> . 

The report concluded that Israel violated the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] by targeting civilians, which it labeled "a grave breach". <ref name=forward/> It also claimed that the violations were "systematic and deliberate", which placed the blame in the first place on those who designed, planned, ordered and oversaw the operations. <ref>[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/UNFFMGC_Report.pdf Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict] Para 1692. </ref> The report recommended, ''inter alia'', that Israel pay reparations to Palestinians living in Gaza for property damage caused during the conflict. <ref>http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=48448 "the Goldstone team has recommended that the 192-member General Assembly set up an escrow fund so that Israel can compensate the Palestinians of Gaza."<br />http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2009/09/15/UNFFMGCReport.pdf para 1665</ref> . 

===Al-Maqadmah mosque incident===. 
{{Main|2009 Ibrahim al-Maqadna Mosque strike}} . 

The report stated that the strike on the al-Maqadmah mosque on the outskirts of Jabilyah occurred when between 200 and 300 men and women attended for their evening prayer, with 15 people being killed and 40 wounded as a result of the attack. The Mission has established that the Israeli armed forces fired a missile that struck near the doorway of the mosque. The Mission found that the mosque was damaged and lodged in its interior walls with "small metal cubes", several of which were retrieved by the Mission when it inspected the site. The Mission concluded that the mosque had been hit by an air-to-ground missile fitted with a shrapnel fragmentation sleeve, fired from an aircraft. The Mission based its findings on investigation of the site, photographs and interviewing witnesses. The Mission found no indications that the mosque was used to launch rockets, store munitions or shelter combatants. The Mission also found that no other damage was done in the area at the time, making the attack an isolated incident. The Mission concluded that the Israelis intentionally bombed the mosque. <ref name=UNFFMGCReport_pdf/><ref name=UNGazareport>{{cite news|url=http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2009/09/15/UNFFMGCReport.pdf|title=HUMAN RIGHTS IN PALESTINE AND OTHER OCCUPIED ARAB TERRITORIES|author=Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=15 September 2009|accessdate=15 September 2009 | location=London}}</ref> Judge Goldstone said: "Assuming that weapons were stored in the mosque, it would not be a war crime to bomb it at night... It would be a war crime to bomb it during the day when 350 people are praying". He further added that there is no other possible interpretation for what could have occurred other than a deliberate targeting of civilians. <ref name="Goldstone: ‘If This Was a Court Of Law, There Would Have Been Nothing Proven.’"/> The report also reproduces a statement from the Israeli government concerning the attack, where the Israeli government both denies that the mosque was attacked and states that the casualties of the attack were Hamas operatives. The report says that the position of the Israeli government contains "apparent contradictions" and is "unsatisfactory" and "demonstrably false". <ref name=UNFFMGCReport_pdf/> . 

===Zeitoun incident===. 
{{Main|Zeitoun incident}} . 

According to interviews with family members, neighbors, Palestinian Red Crescent personnel, submissions from various NGOs and visits to the site, the extended al-Samouni family gathered together in one house after the fighting in the area was over, ordered there by Israeli soldiers patrolling their Gaza neighborhood of Zeytoun as part of the ground phase of the Gaza War; when five men stepped out of the house to collect firewood, a missile struck them, fired, possibly, from an Apache helicopter; several more missiles followed, this time aimed directly at the house. In all, 21 family members were killed, including women and children. When the surviving al-Samounis attempted to leave and make their way to Gaza City, they were told by an Israeli soldier to return to the house. <ref name="Goldstone: ‘If This Was a Court Of Law, There Would Have Been Nothing Proven.’"/> In April 2011, Goldstone wrote that the shelling of the home was apparently the consequence of an Israeli commander’s erroneous interpretation of a drone image. <ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/reconsidering-the-goldstone-report-on-israel-and-war-crimes/2011/04/01/AFg111JC_story.html Reconsidering the Goldstone Report]</ref> . 

===Al-Fakhura school incident===. 
{{Main|Al-Fakhura school incident}} . 

The report says that IDF's mortar shelling near a United Nations-run Al-Fakhura school in the Jabaliya refugee camp, which was sheltering some 1,300 people, killed 35 and wounded up to 40 people. The investigation did not exclude the possibility that Israeli forces were responding to fire from an armed Palestinian group, as Israel said, but said that this and similar attacks "cannot meet the test of what a reasonable commander would have determined to be an acceptable loss of civilian life for the military advantage sought". <ref name="Inquiry Finds Gaza War Crimes From Both Sides"/> The mission criticized IDF for the choice of the weapons for the supposed counterstrike and concluded that the IDF fire at the Al-Fakhura street violated the law of proportionality. <ref name="Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict">[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/12session/A-HRC-12-48.pdf Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict], UNHCR report, 25 September 2009, para. 696–698, late submission</ref> . 

===Abd Rabbo family incident===. 
{{Main|Abd Rabbo family incident}}
According to the Mission's report, the committee found Khaled and Kawthar Abd Rabbo to be credible and reliable witnesses and it had no reason to doubt the veracity of the main elements of their testimony, which it says is consistent with the accounts it received from other eyewitnesses and NGOs. <ref name="Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict">[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/12session/A-HRC-12-48.pdf Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict], UNHRC, 25 September 2009, para. 777</ref> The report concludes that the Israeli soldiers deliberately shot at the family members, as they could not perceive any danger from the house, its occupants or the surroundings. The report bases its conclusion on the premise that the family, consisting of a man, a young and an elderly woman and three small girls, some of them waving white flags, stepped out of the house and stood still for several minutes waiting for instructions from the soldiers. <ref name="Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict"/> . 

===White phosphorus allegations===. 
[[File:GazaWPshelling.GIF.gif|right|175px|thumb|"Israeli Army drop [[White Phosphorus]] bombs on Gaza residential areas". <ref>http://cc.aljazeera.net/asset/language/arabic/war-gaza-day-16</ref>(picture from [[Al-Jazeera]])]] .

The report says that Israeli forces were "systematically reckless" in determining the use of [[white phosphorus]] in built-up areas. <ref>[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/12session/A-HRC-12-48.pdf Page 21 of the HUMAN RIGHTS IN PALESTINE AND OTHER OCCUPIED ARAB TERRITORIES], Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict</ref> The writers highlighted the Israeli attack on the UN Relief and Works Agency compound in Gaza City on 15 January, the attack on the Al Quds hospital, and the attack on the Al Wafa hospital, each of which involved using white phosphorus. They described its use as disproportionate or excessive under [[international law]]. More generally, the UN report recommended that "serious consideration should be given to banning the use of white phosphorus in built-up areas.”<ref name="UN accuses Israel of committing war crimes in Gaza">{{citenews|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6835910.ece|title=UN accuses Israel of committing war crimes in Gaza|date=16 September 2009|publisher=[[Times Online]]|first=James|last=Bone|accessdate=16 October 2009 | location=London}}</ref> . 

===Human shields allegations===. 
The report also accused Israel of using Palestinians as “[[human shields]]” and torturing detainees. <ref name="UN accuses Israel of committing war crimes in Gaza"/> The human shields accusations were supported in 2010, with Israel charging two soldiers with forcing a 9-year-old Palestinian boy to open bags suspected of containing bombs. <ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1155800.html Two IDF soldiers charged with using 9-year-old 'human shield' in Gaza war (Haaretz, 11 March 2010)]</ref> . 

==Accusations against Palestinian militants==. 
{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}
The report also stated there is evidence that Palestinian armed groups committed war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity by deliberately launching rockets and firing mortars into Israel, calculated to kill civilians and damage civilian structures. <ref name=BBCSept15a>{{Cite news

}}</ref> The report accused Palestinian armed groups of causing psychological trauma to the civilians within the range of the rockets. It also concluded that killings and abuses of members of the Fatah political movement amount to a “serious violation of human rights”. <ref name="Inquiry Finds Gaza War Crimes From Both Sides"/> . 

The Mission, however, found no evidence of Palestinian armed groups placing civilians in areas where attacks were being launched; of engaging in combat in civilian dress; or of using a mosque for military purposes or to shield military activities. <ref>[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/UNFFMGC_Report.pdf Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict] Para 1750. </ref> This statement contrasted with media reports that Hamas fighters wore civilian clothes and concealed their weapons. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article5497340.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Gazas tunnels traps and martyrs the Hamas strategy to defeat Israel | first1=Azmi | last1=Keshawi | first2=Sheera | last2=Frenkel | date=12 January 2009 | accessdate=26 May 2010}}</ref> In March 2009, the Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center (Malam) published a report that included material supplied by the IDF and [[Shin Bet]] (Israel Security Agency) as part of an effort to counter the Goldstone Report.

While discussing an obligation of Palestinian armed groups to protect the civilian population in Gaza, the report notes that those interviewed in Gaza appeared reluctant to speak about the presence of or conduct of hostilities by the Palestinian armed groups. The Mission does not discount that the interviewees’ reluctance may have stemmed from a fear of reprisals. <ref>[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/12session/A-HRC-12-48.pdf Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict], para. 440</ref> The report also criticized the treatment of captured Israeli soldier [[Gilad Shalit]], and called for his release.  . 

==Reactions==. 
===Israel===. 
The Israeli government issued an initial 32-point formal response to the fact-finding mission's report on 24 September 2009. The response listed a series of what it argued were serious flaws and biases in the report, finally concluding that the report perverts international law to serve a political agenda. ([[United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict#Preliminary analysis by Israeli government|See below]].) . 

Also in October 2009, Israel pressured the Palestinian president to postpone asking for a UN vote on the Goldstone report. [[Yuval Diskin]], head of the Israeli Shin Bet security service, met in [[Ramallah]] with President Mahmud Abbas and informed him that if Abbas refuses to ask to postpone the UN vote on the Goldstone report then Israel will turn the [[West Bank]] into a "second Gaza": the Shin Bet chief told Abbas that if he did not ask for a deferral of the vote, Israel would withdraw permission for mobile phone company Wataniya to operate in the Palestinian Authority and threatened to revoke the easing of restrictions on movement within the West Bank that had been implemented earlier in 2009. <ref>Haaretz, 17 Jan. 2010, "Diskin to Abbas: Defer UN Vote on Goldstone or Face 'Second Gaza,'" http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1143038.html</ref> . 

[[File:Shimon Peres in WEF on the Middle East 2009.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Israeli President [[Shimon Peres]] said the mission's report "makes a mockery of history".]]
[[President of Israel|Israeli President]] [[Shimon Peres]] said that the report "makes a mockery of history" and that "it does not distinguish between the aggressor and the defender. War is crime and the attacker is the criminal. The defender has no choice. The Hamas terror organization is the one who started the war and also carried out other awful crimes. Hamas has used terrorism for years against Israeli children." Peres also stated that "the report gives de facto legitimacy to terrorist initiatives and ignores the obligation and right of every country to defend itself, as the UN itself had clearly stated." He added that the report "Failed to supply any other way for Hamas fire to stop. The IDF's operations have boosted the West Bank's economy, liberated Lebanon from Hezbollah terror and allowed Gazans to resume normalcy. The Israeli government withdrew (from Gaza) and Hamas began a murderous rampage, firing thousands of shells on women and children – innocent civilians, instead of rebuilding Gaza and caring for the population's welfare. (Hamas) builds tunnels and used civilians and children to shield terrorists and hide weapons."<ref>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3777814,00.html Peres: Goldstone Report makes mockery of history], Ynet News 16 September 2009</ref> .

He also warned world leaders that they and their anti-terror forces could be targets for charges similar to those in the report. <ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=1115418&contrassID=0&subContrassID=0 Netanyahu asks world to reject Goldstone findings], Haaretz 5 November 2009</ref> At the [[United Nations General Assembly]], Netanyahu called the report biased and unjust, asking: "Will you stand with Israel or will you stand with the terrorists?

Only if we have the confidence that we can defend ourselves can we take further risks for peace."<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/24/AR2009092404598.html Israeli Leader Blasts Ahmadinejad at U.N.], 24 September 2009</ref> . 

[[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel|Israeli Foreign Minister]] [[Avigdor Lieberman]] said: "The Goldstone Commission is a commission established with the aim of finding Israel guilty of crimes ahead of time, [the commission] was dispatched by countries in which the terms 'human rights' and 'combat ethics' are unknown". He added that "the IDF was forced to deal with the lowest form of terrorists that set themselves the goal of killing women and children [by] hiding behind women and children.

====Preliminary analysis by Israel==== . 

The [[Cabinet of Israel|Government of Israel]] issued a 32-point preliminary analysis of the report, titled "Initial Response to Report of the Fact Finding Mission on Gaza Established Pursuant to Resolution S-9/1 of the Human Rights Council". The main arguments in the analysis were the following. 
{{Quotation|
# The resolution mandating the mission was one-sided and prejudicial and the terms of the mandate were never changed. 
# The composition of the Mission and its conduct raised serious questions about its impartiality. 
# Incidents selected for examination were cherry-picked for political effect. 
# The mission displayed double standards in acceptance of evidence: treating even photogaphic evidence presented by Israel as inherently untrustworthy, except when it could be used to condemn Israel, while uncritically accepting statements by Hamas; reinterpreting or dismissing self-incriminating statements by Hamas; and selectively quoting material from sources. 
# The report includes misstatements of fact: for example, it stated that Israel discriminated against its non-Jewish citizens in providing shelter from Palestinian rocket attacks , when the shelter was provided on the basis of proximity to the Gaza Strip and did not discriminate between Jews and non-Jews. 
# The report contains misstatements of law: for example, its description of the Israeli appeals process is outdated. 
# The report fails to consider the military complexities of the war, makes judgments lacking necessary knowledge, and ignores Israel's extensive efforts to maintain humanitarian standards and protect civilians. 
# The report unjustifiably minimizes the threat of terrorism and in effect vindicates terrorist tactics. 
# The report presents its findings as judicial determinations of guilt, despite its admission that it does not reach a judicial level of proof; it commits egregious legal errors, including unjustifiable assumptions regarding intent and commanders' states of mind, as well as misinterpretation of the willfulness requirement of responsibility under international law. 
# The report ignores Israel's own investigations into its conduct, overlooks the many independent levels of scrutiny in Israel's judicial system, misrepresents Israel's legal mechanisms and shows disdain for democratic values. 
# The report makes one-sided recommendations against Israel while making only token recommendations with respect to Palestinians: for example, recommending Israel compensate Palestinians for attacks without recommending Palestinians compensate Israelis for attacks.}} . 

The analysis concludes that the report claims to represent international law but perverts it to serve a political agenda; that it sends a "legally unfounded message to states everywhere confronting terrorism that international law has no effective response to offer them", and that it signals to terrorist groups "that the cynical tactics of seeking to exploit civilian suffering for political ends actually pays dividends". <ref>[http://www.mfa.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/FC985702-61C4-41C9-8B72-E3876FEF0ACA/0/GoldstoneReportInitialResponse240909.pdf Initial Response to Report of the Fact Finding Mission on Gaza], [[Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]</ref> .

Following the postponing of the vote on the resolution in UNHRC, the [[Palestinian National Authority]] came under heavy criticism for agreeing to defer the draft proposal endorsing all recommendations of the UN Fact Finding Mission.

He further added that "this report was important; what bothered some parties was that the report simply monitored international law, international humanitarian law and all relevant international instruments. This was not a political instrument that supported Palestine or Israel". He added the report was the first time killings of Palestinian civilians have been documented, and that his people would not forgive if those responsible were not punished. <ref name="Kuwaitnews">[http://www.kuna.net.kw/NewsAgenciesPublicSite/ArticleDetails.aspx?Language=en&id=2028226 Arab, African groups, OIC, NAM welcome Goldstone report (Kuwait News Agency, Sept. 29, 2009)]</ref> . 

Eleven Palestinian human rights organizations, including two based in Israel, called on the Palestinian Authority and the Hamas government in Gaza to investigate Palestinian violations of international law allegedly committed during the Gaza War. Alleged violations include Palestinian attacks on civilians in Israel and instances of internal repression, such as summary executions in the Gaza Strip and arrests and torture in the West Bank. The letter asked to launch investigations before the 5 February deadline. The authors of the call said that for PLO efforts to have the report endorsed by the UN to be of lasting value, the Palestinian authorities must take action to implement its recommendations. <ref name="haaretz.com">[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1143330.html Palestinian activists urge Hamas to probe own Gaza war crimes], Haaretz, 18 January 2010</ref> .

<blockquote>*The commission’s report lacks context. It does not take account of the nature of Israel’s enemy – operating from the midst of civilian populations, committed to Israel’s destruction, and fully supported by state actors Iran and Syria. </blockquote>
<blockquote>*The report does not take into account the extent to which witnesses from Gaza were likely intimidated by Hamas. </blockquote>
<blockquote>*In general, the report is credulous of Hamas claims but skeptical of Israeli claims. </blockquote> . 

Goldstone and several U.S.-based rights groups denounced the resolution. [[Sarah Leah Whitson]], a director of Middle East and North Africa Division of Human Rights Watch, commented that "this sort of resolution sends a terrible message to the international community about American willingness to believe in international justice for all. I hope that the members of Congress reject it. It's funny because it accuses the Goldstone Report of being one sided but it's not.

Israeli human rights group [[B'Tselem]], along with eight other Israeli human-rights NGOs, stated that they "expect the Government of Israel to respond to the substance of the report's findings and to desist from its current policy of casting doubt upon the credibility of anyone who does not adhere to the establishment's narrative."<ref name=btselem>{{cite web

The [[European Centre for Law and Justice]] (ECLJ) – the international affiliate of the American Center for Law and Justice – claimed in its analyses of the Report that among numerous flaws in it, the Mission misstated the International Humanitarian Law regarding the obligation of the fighters engaged in hostilities to distinguish themselves from the civilian population by uniform (perfidy violation per [[s:Protocol I#Art 37. Prohibition of Perfidy|Article 37]] of the [[Protocol I]]). <ref>[http://www.eclj.org/pdf/ECLJ_MemoonGoldstoneReport_20100126.pdf LEGAL MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO ERRONEOUS ALLEGATIONS AND FLAWED LEGAL CONCLUSIONS CONTAINED IN THE GOLDSTONE REPORT], p. 46 of the report (p.48 of the file), ECLJ, 26 January 2010. </ref> .

===Journalism===. 
''[[The Financial Times]]'' (UK) called the report balanced and criticized attacks on Goldstone. It argued, however, that Israeli objections to the UNHRC were on strong ground, stating that "council members from [[Libya]] to [[Angola]] hide behind the Palestinian cause to deflect attention from their own records of serious human rights abuse". <ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/425c2276-bcdb-11de-a7ec-00144feab49a.html Goldstone’s Gaza report is balanced], Financial Times 19 October 2009</ref> . 

''[[The Independent]]'' wrote that Israel should open a parliamentary investigation after the model of the [[Kahan Commission]] to look into its actions in Gaza. The paper wrote that "strong democratic nations are able to scrutinise their own behaviour, even in times of conflict. It is time for Israel to demonstrate its own democratic strength". <ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/leading-articles/leading-article-israel-must-investigate-seriously-1887449.html Leading article: Israel must investigate seriously (The Independent, 3 February 2010)]</ref> . 

''[[The Economist]]'' (UK) denounced the report as "deeply flawed" and detrimental to the [[Israeli-Palestinian peace process]], arguing that it was tainted by anti-Israel prejudice in the UNHRC. In particular, ''The Economist'' chastised the mission for saying there was little or no evidence showing Hamas endangered civilians by basing themselves around schools, mosques and hospitals, as the charge was supported by many reports in the public domain. <ref>[http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14455609 Opportunity missed], ''[[The Economist]]'', 19 September 2009. </ref> . 

''[[The Times]]'' (UK) criticized the report as "provocative bias" and described as dangerous and unreasonable the moral equivalence drawn in the report between Israel and Hamas. ''The Times'' praised Israel for quietly continuing to conduct its own investigation into the conflict despite the report, and concluded that Israel "is an accountable, democratic, transparent nation, and fighting to remain one amid challenges that few other nations ever have to face". <ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/leading_article/article7011611.ece White Phosphorus: Israel is a nation both keen and able to hold itself to account], ''[[The Times]]'' 02-02-2010</ref> . 

''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote that "...the Goldstone commission proceeded to make a mockery of impartiality with its judgment of facts. It concluded, on scant evidence, that "disproportionate destruction and violence against civilians were part of a deliberate policy" by Israel. At the same time it pronounced itself unable to confirm that Hamas hid its fighters among civilians, used human shields, fired mortars and rockets from outside schools, stored weapons in mosques, and used a hospital for its headquarters, despite abundant available evidence". <ref name="War unchecked">[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/14/AR2009111402279.html War unchecked], 15 November 2009 ,The Washington Post</ref> . 

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' criticized the report, calling it a "new low" in United Nations bias on Israel-related matters. WSJ wrote that the commission's members "were forced to make some astonishing claims of fact" in order to reach some of their conclusions. In particular, WSJ criticized the report's claim that the Gaza police force was a "civilian" agency and its inability to establish Palestinian use of mosques for military purposes despite evidence to the contrary. <ref>{{cite news|author=Post |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204518504574423652321177372.html |title=Gaza Report Shows Anti-Israel Bias - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=23 September 2009 |accessdate=17 October 2009}}</ref> . 

===Military commentators===. 
Colonel [[Richard Kemp]], former commander of [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|British forces in Afghanistan]], addressed the UNHRC at October 2009, speaking on behalf of [[UN Watch]]. He said that Hamas is "adept at staging and distorting incidents" and asserted that during the conflict the Israel Defense Forces "did more to safeguard the rights of civilians in a combat zone than any other army in the history of warfare" and that Palestinian civilian casualties were a consequence of Hamas' way of fighting, which involved using human shields as a matter of policy, and deliberate attempts to sacrifice their own civilians. He added that Israel took extraordinary measures to give Gaza civilians notice of targeted areas, aborted potentially effective missions in order to prevent civilian casualties, and took "unthinkable" risks by allowing huge amounts of humanitarian aid into Gaza during the fighting. <ref name="UNHRC endorses Goldstone's Gaza report by large majority">[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1255694824777&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull 'Mistakes are not war crimes'], UNHRC endorses Goldstone's Gaza report by large majority, Jerusalem Post, 16 October 2009. </ref> Goldstone stated that Kemp was not interviewed "because the report did not deal with the issues he raised regarding the problems of conducting military operations in civilian areas". <ref name="OutcastPg1">David E Kaplan, [http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?apage=1&cid=1255547726295&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Richard Goldstone: Outcast], pg.1, The Jerusalem Post, 15 October 2009</ref> . 

Australian Major General [[Jim Molan]] (retired), who served as chief of operations of the Iraq multinational force in 2004–05, stated that "The Goldstone report is an opinion by one group of people putting forward their judgments, with limited access to the facts, and reflecting their own prejudices. The difference in tone and attitude in the report when discussing Israeli and Hamas actions is surprising." ... "as a soldier who has run a war against an opponent not dissimilar to Hamas, facing problems perhaps similar to those faced by Israeli commanders, my sympathies tend to lie with the Israelis." ... "But having stated my prejudice, I think I may be more honest than Goldstone, who seems to pass off his prejudices in a report that cannot be based on fact, and uses judicial language and credibility to do so. It comes down to equality of scepticism: if you refuse to believe anything the Israelis say, then you have no right to unquestioningly accept what Hamas says."<ref name="UN's bias binds Gaza">Jim Molan, [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,26152548-7583,00.html UN's bias binds Gaza], The Australian, 2 October 2009. </ref> . 

===Legal commentators===. 
Writing in the [[Financial Times]] Italian Jurist [[Antonio Cassese]] who was the first President of the International Criminal Tribunal For the Former Yugoslavia argued that critics of the report were relying primarily on [[ad hominem]] and [[strawman]] attacks. He argued that "critics have given inaccurate descriptions of the report’s findings" and that "those who claim the mission’s mandate was biased against Israel seem to have ignored a significant fact: Justice Goldstone, whose mission was initially asked to look into alleged violations only by Israel, demanded—and received—a change of mandate to include attacks by Hamas." Furthermore, he argued that many critics of the report "have launched personal attacks on Justice Goldstone’s character" and some critics have even gone as far as labeling Goldstone, who is Jewish, "an 'anti-Semite' of a kind who 'despise and hate our own people'”. <ref>[http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/leading-international-jurist-on-goldstone-report/ We must stand behind the UN report on Gaza]</ref> . 

Former [[Canadian Minister of Justice]], [[Attorney General of Canada]], former president of the [[Canadian Jewish Congress]] and former Director of the Human Rights Program at [[McGill University]] Professor [[Irwin Cotler]] called the inquiry "inherently tainted", agreeing with Mary Robinson and Richard Goldstone that its original mandate was "deeply one-sided and flawed" prior to being broadened, and stating that the UNHRC is "systematically and systemically biased against Israel". <ref>The Goldstone Mission – Tainted to the core (part I), Jerusalem Post 18 August 2009</ref> He opposed the report, which he regarded as "tainted". At the same time, he is in favor of establishing an independent inquiry into the Gaza war, saying that Israel would set a precedent if it creates such an inquiry that according to his best knowledge "no other democracy" had. <ref name="Cotler: Israel should probe Gaza war">[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1256150020918&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Cotler: Israel should probe Gaza war], JPost, 22 October 2009</ref> . 

[[Princeton university|Princeton]] professor emeritus of international law [[Richard Falk]], appointed in 2008 by the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] (UNHRC) to serve as a [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on "the situation of human rights in the [[Palestinian territories]] occupied since 1967", endorsed the report as "an historic contribution to the Palestinian struggle for justice, an impeccable documentation of a crucial chapter in their victimization under occupation". Writing in [[Electronic Intifada]], Falk further commented that the report appeared to him to be "more sensitive" to Israel's contentions that Hamas was guilty of war crimes, and that the report in many ways "endorses the misleading main line of the Israeli narrative". Falk was critical of charges that the report, or the UNHRC, were biased and inferred that such criticism amounted to an attempt to "avoid any real look at the substance of the charges". <ref>{{cite web|author=nigelparry.net |url=http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article10788.shtml |title=ei: The Goldstone report and the battle for legitimacy |publisher=Electronicintifada.net |date= |accessdate=17 October 2009}}</ref> . 

[[York University]] scholar of human rights and humanitarian law Professor [[Anne Bayefsky]] said that the report, which claims to be a human rights document, never mentions the racist, genocidal intent of the enemy, which Israel confronted after years of restraint. She added that the report relies on testimonies from witnesses speaking under circumstances that gave rise to "a fear of reprisals" from Hamas should they have dared to tell the truth. <ref name="Obama's new leverage—against its ally">[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1254827721458&pagename=JPArticle%2FShowFull Obama's new leverage – against its ally], JPost, 6 October 2009</ref> . 

[[Harvard]] law professor [[Alan Dershowitz]] wrote that the problem with the report is what its composers willfully and deliberately refused to see and hear. He said that the commission ignored easily accessible videotapes that show Hamas operatives routinely firing rockets from behind human shields, and the report dismissed eyewitness accounts published by reputable newspapers and admissions by Hamas leaders regarding Hamas military activities. <ref name="Goldstone report is an ad hominem attack">[http://cgis.jpost.com/Blogs/dershowitz/entry/goldstone_report_is_an_ad Goldstone report is an ad hominem attack], JPost, 27 September 2009</ref> . 

[[University of Toronto]] professor of law [[Ed Morgan (professor)|Ed Morgan]] wrote in ''the [[Toronto Star]]'' that in dealing with the alleged use of human shielding of the Gaza civilian population by Hamas, the report "put its head in the sand", saying merely that "[t]he mission notes that those interviewed in Gaza appeared reluctant to speak about the presence of or conduct of hostilities by the Palestinian armed groups". The article also criticized the way the committee dismissed first-hand evidences from IDF soldiers implying that mosques were used as launching points for Hamas attacks and as weapons storage facilities."<ref name="Goldstone report undermines faith in international law">[http://www.thestar.com/comment/article/713921 Goldstone report undermines faith in international law] The Toronto Star, 22 October 2009</ref> . 

Professor [[Daniel Friedmann]], who served as the [[Justice Minister of Israel]] during the [[Gaza War]], criticized what he called the "reinterpretation" of evidence unfavorable to Hamas. As an example, he cites the statement of the Hamas police force spokesman saying that "police officers received clear orders from the leadership to face the [Israeli] enemy". He says that the committee uncritically accepted the explanation that the intention was that in the event of an invasion, the police would continue to uphold public order and ensure the movement of essential supplies. <ref name="'Goldstone report—the terrorists' Magna Carta'">[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1256799045773&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter 'Goldstone report – the terrorists' Magna Carta'], JPost, 29 October 2009</ref> . 

Writing in the [[JURIST]], Laurie Blank of Emory Law's International Humanitarian Law Clinic and Gregory Gordon of the University of North Dakota School of Law said that the Goldstone Report's major flaw is that it fails the law. In their view, the Report incorrectly claims Israel disproportionately attacked civilians by relying on information gathered after the fact and discounting contemporaneous Israeli intentions or actions and the surrounding circumstances; the Report unjustly accuses Israel of a disproportionate response to eight years of Hamas's attacks, unfairly presenting Operation Cast Lead as disproportionate overall; the Report treats Israel and Hamas disproportionately by holding them to different standards, merely suggesting that Hamas's actions "would constitute" legal violations. <ref>[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/2009/11/goldstone-gaza-and-disproportionality.php Goldstone, Gaza and (Dis)Proportionality: Three Strikes], JURIST, 4 November 2009</ref> .

Noam Shalit, father of Israeli soldier [[Gilad Shalit]] held captive by Hamas, urged the UN to take all possible measures to implement the Goldstone report's recommendations on the status of his son. The Goldstone report calls for the immediate release of Gilad Shalit and, while Shalit is in captivity, for access to him by the International Red Cross. <ref>Haaretz, 1 Mar. 2010, "Noam Shalit Urges UN to Implement Goldstone Report," http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1153080.html</ref> .

[[Noam Chomsky]] argued that the Goldstone report is biased in favour of Israel since the report failed to question Israel's contention that it was acting in self-defence. Chomsky stressed that the right to self-defence requires that peaceful means are first exhausted before resorting to military force, something Israel "did not even contemplate doing". <ref>[http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=35407 Noam Chomsky: no change in US 'Mafia principle' (Middle East Online, Nov. 1, 2009)]</ref> .

[[Richard Landes]], who also maintains the "Understanding the Goldstone Report" site, published in the December 2009 volume of the Israeli [[Middle East Review of International Affairs|MERIA]] Journal critical analyses of the Goldstone report. Landes argued that the report fails to investigate seriously the problem of Hamas embedding its war effort in the midst of civilian infrastructure in order to draw Israeli fire and then accuse Israel of war crimes; the report is credulous concerning all Palestinian claims, contrasted with a corresponding skepticism of all Israeli claims; the report harshly judges Israel for war crimes, contrasted with its resolute agnosticism concerning Hamas intentions. Landes concluded that Goldstone actually participates in Hamas' strategy, which, according to Landes, encourages the sacrificing of their own civilians. <ref>[http://www.gloria-center.org/meria/2009/12/landes1.html GOLDSTONE'S GAZA REPORT: PART ONE: A FAILURE OF INTELLIGENCE], MERIA Journal, Volume 13, No. 4 – December 2009</ref> . 

In an interview on the independent U.S. news broadcaster [[Democracy Now]], [[Norman Finkelstein]] questioned the way the report judged the events in Gaza based on the [[laws of war]], saying that Gaza did not meet the criteria of a war zone, calling it instead a "massacre". He went on to say that there was no fighting in Gaza, and referred to quotes from the testimonies of the Israeli soldiers published in the report by NGO [[Breaking the Silence (non-governmental organization)|Breaking the Silence]]. Concerning the substance of the report, Finkelstein says the Goldstone report is in-line with reports compiled by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch in the findings that Israel had targeted civilians and the Palestinian infrastructure. <ref name="democracynow.org">[http://www.democracynow.org/2009/9/16/un_inquiry_finds_israel_punished_and ''UN Inquiry Finds Israel “Punished and Terrorized” Palestinian Civilians, Committed War Crimes During Gaza Assault'', Democracy Now!, 16 September 2009]</ref> .

In an interview with the ''[[Jewish Forward]]'', published on 7 October 2009, Goldstone emphasized that his task was to conduct a "fact-finding mission" and not an "investigation." He acknowledged the reliance on Palestinian (Gazan and Hamas) testimonies, noting his mission cross-checked those accounts against each other and sought corroboration from photos, satellite photos, contemporaneous reports, forensic evidence and the mission’s own inspections of the sites in question. He further acknowledged that "We had to do the best we could with the material we had. If this were a court of law there would have been nothing proven. ... I would not consider it in any way embarrassing if many of the allegations turn out to be disproved."<ref name=forward>{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/116269/ |title=Goldstone: ‘If This Was a Court Of Law, There Would Have Been Nothing Proven.’ – |publisher=Forward.com |date= |accessdate=17 October 2009}}</ref> . 

''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' published a brief telephone interview with Desmond Travers in which he was asked to respond to criticism of the mission and the report. He rejected the criticism that insufficient weight was given to the difficulties of fighting in the urban environment, and said that he was surprised by what he called "the intensity and viciousness of the personal attacks aimed at members of the Mission". He also said that the mission found no evidence that mosques were used to store munitions; in two cases investigated, neither was used as anything but a place of worship. He added that he had seen no credible criticism of the report itself or of the information in it. <ref>[http://harpers.org/archive/2009/10/hbc-90006003 Six Questions for Desmond Travers on the Goldstone Report] Harpers Magazine 29 October 2009. </ref> . 

Travers' statement regarding the use of mosques was challenged by a researcher at JCPA Colonel (res.) Halevi. Halevi said that the use of mosques as munition storage is supported by photographs of weapons seized in the Salah a-Din mosque in Gaza City during the operation, and the committee did not explain why it chose to disregard the information completely. <ref name="What happened at mosque?">[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3804323,00.html What happened at mosque?], YNET, 12 November 2009</ref> .

The vote for the UNHRC resolution endorsing the report was delayed on 2 October 2009 until the council's meeting in March 2010, after Palestinian delegation dropped its support for a resolution, apparently under heavy U.S. pressure. <ref name="UN delays action on Gaza war report">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/oct/02/united-nations-israel-gaza-war UN delays action on Gaza war report], The Guardian, 2 October 2009. </ref> But on 11 October, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called on the UN Human Rights Council to hold a special session to endorse the Goldstone Report. <ref name="Abbas wants UN session on Goldstone">[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1255204773689&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Abbas wants UN session on Goldstone], JPost, 12 October 2009. </ref> UN officials announced that the UN Human Rights Council would reopen the debate about the report's findings on 15 October. <ref>[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1255204787988&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull UNHRC to reopen debate on Goldstone Report], JPost, 13 October 2009. </ref> [[UN Watch]] issued a statement saying that the announced special Council's session would be a gross abuse of the procedures. <ref>[http://blog.unwatch.org/?p=484 U.N.

Israeli officials rejected the UN Human Rights Council decision to endorse the report.

The report was adopted by a vote of 25 in favour, 6 against, and 11 abstentions at a meeting held on 16 October 2009. The vote was as follows:<ref>http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/256468C04BA76568C1257651004F7DA0?opendocument</ref> . 

Goldstone criticized the United Nations Human Rights Council resolution for targeting only Israel, and failing to include Hamas: "This draft resolution saddens me as it includes only allegations against Israel. There is not a single phrase condemning Hamas as we have done in the report. I hope that the council can modify the text". <ref>[http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle08.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2009/October/middleeast_October385.xml&section=middleeast Israel faces potential embarrassment at UN], AFP (reprinted in Khaleej Times 16 October 2009)</ref> . 

On 13 April 2011, the UNHCR recommended that the General Assembly reconsider the report at its sixty-sixth session (to be held in September 2011), and urges the Assembly to submit that report to the Security Council for its consideration and appropriate action, including consideration of referral of the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, pursuant to article 13 (b) of the Rome Statute. <ref> [http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/IP%20A%20HRC%20RES%2016%2032.pdf UNHCR resolution 16/32]</ref> The resolution was drafted by the Palestinian Authority and adopted by the Human Rights Council with 27 states voting in favour, three against, and 16 abstentions. It followed the second report of a Committee of Independent Experts, established to monitor the domestic investigations into violations committed during the conflict, which was submitted to the Human Rights Council on 18 March 2011. The report concurred with Amnesty International’s assessment that – more than 18 months since the UN Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict documented crimes under international law committed by both sides – the Israeli authorities and the Hamas de facto administration have failed to conduct investigations meeting the required international standards of independence, impartiality, thoroughness, effectiveness and promptness. The General Assembly has already twice called on the domestic authorities to conduct credible, independent investigations into the serious violations of international humanitarian and international human rights law documented by the UN Fact-Finding Mission, in resolutions adopted in November 2009 and February 2010. Those calls appear to have been ignored meaning that the General Assembly would be entitled to submit the issue to the Security Council. <ref> [http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE15/021/2011/en/8d30cd31-448a-4b10-9c02-cd4da79939e7/mde150212011en.html Amnesty International - UN resolution must be translated into international justice for Gaza conflict victims]</ref> . 

===General Assembly=== . 

The [[United Nations General Assembly]] endorsed a resolution calling for independent investigations to be conducted by Israel and Hamas on allegations of war crimes described in the Goldstone report. The resolution was passed by overwhelming numbers with 114 in favour and 18 against, and 44 abstentions. The resolution calls on the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary General]] to report to the General Assembly within three months "with a view to considering further action, if necessary, by the relevant United Nations organs and bodies", and to send the report to the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]. <ref name="UN backs Gaza war crimes report">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8342915.stm UN backs Gaza war crimes report (BBC, Nov. 5, 2009)]<br>[http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49161 POLITICS: U.N.

Most developing countries voted in favor. The countries that voted against the resolution were: Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, [[Israel]], Italy, the [[Marshall Islands]], [[Federated States of Micronesia]], [[Nauru]], the Netherlands, [[Palau]], [[Panama]], Poland, [[Slovakia]], The [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Ukraine]] and the United States. Some European countries, namely [[Albania]], [[Belarus]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Cyprus]], Ireland, Portugal, [[Malta]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovenia]] and Switzerland, voted in favor of the resolution.

Israeli Foreign Minister [[Avigdor Lieberman]] said the vote showed that Israel has a "moral majority", adding: "[we] are pleased that 18 democratic 'premier league' states voted in line with Israel's position, while 44 South American and African states abstained". <ref name=moral>[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1257455198182&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull FM: UNGA vote shows Israel has moral majority], Jerusalem Post 6 November 2009</ref> The Palestinian ambassador to the UN stated that "the General Assembly sent a powerful message", adding that if Israelis do not comply, "we will go after them."<ref name="UN backs Gaza war crimes report"/> . 

The General Assembly passed a second resolution on 26 February 2010 to call once more for credible investigations into war crimes allegations detailed in the report, giving both sides five months to report on their investigations. The resolution was passed by a vote of 98–7 with 31 abstentions, with several European countries changing their vote from against to abstaining or from abstaining to supporting relative to the first resolution. Slovak Foreign Minister [[Miroslav Lajcak]] attributed the change in voting partly to a negative reaction in Europe to an [[Assassination of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh|assassination]] carried out in Dubai, which was largely been blamed on Israel. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8539681.stm UN renews demand for investigations into Gaza conflict (BBC, Feb. 26, 2010)]</ref><ref>[http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=170151 'Dubai passports impacted vote' (Jerusalem Post, 4 March 2010)]</ref> .

The ICC Prosecutor could seek a determination from the Judges of the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber on whether he can open an investigation into crimes committed during the conflict on the basis of a declaration issued by the Palestinian Authority in January 2009. That declaration accepted the jurisdiction of the ICC over crimes “committed on the territory of Palestine since 1 July 2002.” Legal experts dispute whether the Palestinian Authority is a “state” capable of making such a declaration under the Rome Statute. If the judges were to determine that the ICC could act on the declaration, a referral by the Security Council would not be required for the ICC to open an investigation. The ICC Prosecutor has not yet sought such a determination. <ref> [http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE15/021/2011/en/8d30cd31-448a-4b10-9c02-cd4da79939e7/mde150212011en.html Amnesty International - UN resolution must be translated into international justice for Gaza conflict victims]</ref> . 

==Israeli internal investigations==. 
The UNHRC Mission's report recommended that both sides in the conflict open credible independent investigations into their own actions. <ref name=debates/> The [[Israeli military]] opened about 100 internal investigations into its actions during the conflict, of which about 20 were criminal. <ref name=debates/> The Prime Minister's Office released a statement on 24 October stating that the Israel Defense Forces had investigated most of the incidents and accusations of human rights abuses mentioned in the report. <ref name=team>[http://74.125.153.132/search?q=cache:1RpTULAHYSAJ:www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite%3Fcid%3D1256150049412%26pagename%3DJPArticle/ShowFull+PM:+Legal+team+will+combat+Goldstone&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk PM: Legal team will combat Goldstone], Jerusalem Post 25 October 2009</ref> Goldstone and human rights organizations said it was insufficient for the military to investigate itself, and the United States urged Israel to mount an independent inquiry. Goldstone also stated that an independent investigation in Israel "would really be the end of the matter, as far as Israel is concerned". <ref name=debates/> . 

In October, support grew within Israel for the launch of an independent inquiry, although the IDF and Defense Ministry argued that it would discredit the military's own internal investigations. <ref name=debates>Heather Sharp, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8322584.stm Israel debates response to Gaza report], BBC News 24 October 2009</ref> That month, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the establishment of a commission headed by Justice Minister [[Yaakov Ne'eman]] that would reassemble and reevaluate material gathered by the IDF to ensure that the investigations were thorough and that no facts were covered up. According to the report, the team would not question soldiers and officers. <ref name=team/> . 

Two professors, Moshe Halbertal and Avi Sagi, called for further investigation of incidents of Israeli troops opening fire on civilians carrying white flags, the destruction of homes in the final days of the operation and the destruction of power stations and water facilities. <ref>http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1126780.html Authors of IDF ethics code demand Gaza war probe (Haaretz)</ref> Former [[Israeli Supreme Court]] President [[Aharon Barak]] advised the Attorney General to establish a state committee endowed with investigative and subpoena powers to look into the claims raised by the Goldstone report. <ref name="haaretz.com"/> The chief legal officer of the IDF, Pnina Sharvit-Baruch, advocated establishing a commission of inquiry to respond to the Goldstone report, which she described as "very, very damaging" to Israel's international standing. She argued that an inquiry was needed to provide Israel with arguments that it had complied with the report's recommendations, rather than to uncover actual war crimes. <ref>http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1147186.html IDF legal official: Israel should probe Goldstone Gaza report (''Haaretz'', 3 February 2010)</ref> . 

In January 2010, the Israeli military completed a rebuttal to the Goldstone report.

In April 2010, Human Rights Watch released a 62-page report on Israels and Hamas' investigations. Concerning Israel, HRW reported that Israel had until that point failed to conduct a credible and independent investigation into the alleged war crimes in Gaza. "Israel's investigations into serious laws-of-war violations by its forces during last year's Gaza war lack thoroughness and credibility", HRW said in a release. <ref name="HRWApril11">[http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/04/09/israelgaza-gaza-war-victims-shortchanged-justice Israel/Gaza: Gaza War Victims Shortchanged on Justice (11 April 2010)]</ref> In July 2010 Israel released second response to the report. <ref>http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3915978,00.html

==Hamas claims==. 
Addressing the report's allegations, initially a Hamas spokesman in Gaza said that the rockets fired at Israel were in self-defense, and were not intended to target civilians: "We were targeting military bases, but the primitive weapons make mistakes". <ref name="Inquiry Finds Gaza War Crimes From Both Sides">[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/16/world/middleeast/16gaza.html?hpw Inquiry Finds Gaza War Crimes From Both Sides], NY Times, 15 September 2009</ref> In what the Associated Press called "a rare deviation from Hamas' violent ideology", Hamas also initially said it regretted killing Israeli civilians. Ahmed Assaf, a spokesman for the rival Palestinian party [[Fatah]], said he was "stunned" at the apology, and said Hamas should instead apologize rather to fellow Palestinians for the deaths and injuries Hamas caused during its [[Fatah-Hamas conflict|violent struggle with Fatah]] over control in Gaza in 2007, which he called a "bloody coup". <ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6150Z720100206 Rivals slam Hamas for "apology" to Israelis], Reuters 02-2010</ref> . 

HRW rejected Hamas's claim: <blockquote>Hamas' claim that rockets were intended to hit Israeli military targets and only accidentally harmed civilians is belied by the facts. Civilians were the target, deliberately targeting civilians is a war crime. </blockquote> HRW deputy Middle East director [[Joe Stork]] stated: "Hamas can spin the story and deny the evidence, but hundreds of rockets rained down on civilian areas in Israel where no military installations were located."<ref>[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=259700 Hamas: Israel manipulating evidence of war crimes], Ma'an News Agency 07-02-2010</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8484947.stm Human Rights Watch rejects Hamas' claims on rockets], BBC 28-01-2010</ref> The [[Associated Press]] noted that "Hamas fired hundreds of rockets toward Israeli towns and cities during the fighting, killing three Israeli civilians". <ref>[http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/ML_ISRAEL_PALESTINIANS?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2010-01-28-13-17-57 Rights group faults Israel's Gaza war crimes probe], AP 28-01-2010</ref> . 

Several days later, Hamas retracted its apology, stating that its statement had been incorrectly interpreted. According to Gaza analyst Naji Sharrab, Hamas's retraction was likely a result of public pressure on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. "They are addressing two different audiences," Sharrab said of Hamas. <ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5h_KtGKVnFYIKK2zNaY7kpOhLt5IQ http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5h_KtGKVnFYIKK2zNaY7kpOhLt5IQ], Associated Press 02-2010</ref> . 

In April 2010, HRW reported that Hamas had not conducted any credible investigations at all. "Hamas has punished no one for ordering or carrying out hundreds of deliberate or indiscriminate rocket attacks into Israeli cities and towns", HRW said in a release. <ref name="HRWApril11"/> . 

==UN Panel assessment==. 
In September 2010, A [[UN Human Rights Council]] panel said Israel and Hamas had failed to conduct credible and adequate investigations into the war crimes allegations contained in the Goldstone report. The panel said Israel only investigated low-ranking officials and failed to investigate the role of "officials at the highest levels", while Hamas was criticised for not making serious efforts to investigate. <ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11384476 UN faults Israeli, Hamas probes into Gaza conflict (BBC, Sept. 21, 2010)]</ref> . 

==Future ramifications==. 
[[File:Mustafa barghouthi.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Mustafa Barghouti]], Palestinian democracy activist]]
It has been suggested by some states, individuals, organisations and media outlets that the Goldstone report may have ramifications for other present and future conflicts, particularly conflicts between states and [[non-state actors]] such as [[terrorist organisations]].  . 

Israel has said that the Goldstone report poses a challenge to the ability of states to defend themselves against terrorism, and warned that similar allegations could be made against other militaries fighting in comparable circumstances. In a statement released by Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Israel claims that the report "[t]ies the hands of democratic countries fighting terror worldwide" and "[p]romotes criminal proceedings against forces confronting terrorism in foreign states."<ref name="Goldstone Fact-Finding Report: A challenge to democracies fighting terror">[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Hamas+war+against+Israel/Goldstone+Fact-Finding_Report_Challenge_democracies_fighting+_error.htm Goldstone Fact-Finding Report: A challenge to democracies fighting terror], Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs 17 September 2009. </ref> Following statements by the United Kingdom's Ambassador to Israel calling upon Israel to investigate the allegations contained in the report, Israeli officials reportedly responded that "[i]f a precedent is set of Israelis being prosecuted for acts during the Gaza war, Britons could also be placed in the dock for actions in Iraq and Afghanistan."<ref name="Israeli officials warn against support for UN report">[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israeli-officials-warn-against-support-for-un-report-1801236.html Israeli officials warn against support for UN report], The Independent 11 October 2009. </ref> Similarly, Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], in an interview broadcast on Israel's Channel 10, said that "... countries that are fighting terrorism must understand that this report hurts not only us but them as well. It hurts peace. It hurts security."<ref name="Goldstone Report: Interviews with PM Netanyahu on Israeli television">[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Speeches+by+Israeli+leaders/2009/Goldstone_Report_Interviews_PM_Netanyahu_17-Sep-2009 Goldstone Report: Interviews with PM Netanyahu on Israeli television], Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs 17 September 2009. </ref> . 

Opinion and editorial pieces expressing similar views have been published in a variety of newspapers and media outlets in the U.S. and Israel, some claiming that American and European military forces could be subject to similar criticism for their operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. <ref name="Britain's Terror Double Take">[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704322004574475560854872736.html Britain's Terror Double Take], Wall Street Journal 16 October 2009. </ref><ref name="The U.N. sides with terrorists">[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/oct/19/the-un-sides-with-terrorists/ The U.N. sides with terrorists], Washington Times 19 October 2009. </ref><ref name="UN report a victory for terror">[http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/09/24/un_report_a_victory_for_terror/ UN report a victory for terror], The Boston Globe 24 September 2009. </ref><ref name="U.S. Is ">[http://www.tnr.com/blog/the-spine/us-concerned-about-the-goldstone-report-gaza-maybe-washington-should-turn-its-eyes-af U.S. Is "Concerned" About the Goldstone Report on Gaza; Maybe Washington Should Turn Its Eyes on Afghanistan and Itsel,].

An article published by the [[BBC]] said that the fact that the Goldstone report might have consequences for countries fighting terrorists that hide among civilians "may have been a consideration for the U.S. and some [[NATO]] countries that either voted against the UN resolution or abstained [at the General Assembly vote]." The article concludes by stating that human rights groups note that the report has reinforced efforts to tackle issues of impunity and lack of accountability for war crimes. <ref name="Legal row over Gaza report intensifies">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8347861.stm Legal row over Gaza report intensifies], BBC News 6-11-2009. </ref> . 

In an interview conducted by [[Al-Jazeera]], American Professor of law and former Lieutenant Colonel in the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] [[Amos N. Guiora]] and Palestinian politician [[Mustafa Barghouti]] both stated that they believed that the Goldstone report would have massive ramifications for the United States and other countries involved in military conflicts. According to Guiora the report "[minimizes] the nation-state's right to self-defence" and "raises extraordinarily important questions for American policymakers and for American commanders presently engaged in Afghanistan and Iraq and that same question is true with respect to other armies."<ref name="aljazeera interview">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vZeBbLeo-M&feature=player_embedded Riz Khan – The Goldstone report dispute – 4 Nov 09 – Part 1], Al-Jazeera 4-11-2009. </ref> . 

On 26 February 2010, in testimony before the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, U.S. [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] "admitted that the report was problematic for the United States and other countries, which face the same type of war on terrorism coming out of populated areas." She also warned that if the Goldstone report were to set the international standards, the U.S. and many other countries might be accused of war crimes for their military operations. <ref name = "Clinton: Goldstone problematic for other countries">[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3854841,00.html Clinton: Goldstone problematic for other countries], Ynetnews 26 February 2010. </ref> . 

In the wake of the report, and following receipt of material from South African, [[International Criminal Court]] prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo stated he was considering opening an investigation into whether Lt. Col. David Benjamin, an IDF reserve officer, allowed war crimes to be committed during the [[Gaza war]]. Benjamin served in the Military Advocate General's international law department, but was actually abroad for most of the period of the conflict and already retired from active duty. Because of his dual Israeli-South African citizenship, he is according to Moreno Ocampo within the jurisdiction of the ICC. <ref>{{cite web

The European Initiative, a pro-Israeli group, lodged an itemized legal complaint with the Belgian Federal Prosecutor’s Office and demanded that the top Hamas leadership in Gaza and Damascus be prosecuted for war crimes. The plaintiffs are Israelis who hold Belgian citizenship and live in the Gaza periphery communities that have been targeted by rockets. The suit is based on the Goldstone Report, as well as on reports by B’Tselem and Amnesty International. <ref>[http://coteret.com/2009/12/24/european-pro-israel-group-moves-in-support-of-universal-jurisdiction-files-belgian-suit-based-on-goldstone-report/ The foreign passports legion], Yehuda Shohat, Yediot, 24 December 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1137413.html Gaza rocket victims to Belgium: Try Hamas chiefs for war crimes, Haaretz, 24 December 2009]</ref> . 

UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, wrote that the even-handed and impartial approach of the team led by Goldstone is indispensable in preventing future human-rights violations and in establishing a solid base for peace and security. <ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/navi-pillay/the-vital-importance-of-e_b_303954.html The Vital Importance of Ending Impunity in Israel and Palestine (Huffington Post, Sept. 30, 2009)]</ref> . 

=={{anchor|Goldstone reappraisal|Goldstone recantation}}Goldstone's retraction of civilian targeting claim== . 

On April 1, 2011 Goldstone published a piece in the [[Washington Post]] titled 'Reconsidering the Goldstone Report on Israel and war crimes'. Goldstone noted that the subsequent investigations by Israel and recognized in the U.N. committee’s report "indicate that civilians were not intentionally targeted as a matter of policy" while "the crimes allegedly committed by Hamas were intentional goes without saying." The other principal authors of the UN report, [[Hina Jilani]], [[Christine Chinkin]] and [[Desmond Travers]], have rejected Goldstone's reassessment arguing that there is "no justification for any demand or expectation for reconsideration of the report as nothing of substance has appeared that would in anyway change the context, findings or conclusions of that report with respect to any of the parties to the Gaza conflict". <ref name="afp1404"/><ref name="g2011-04-14"/> . 

===Goldstone's statement===. 
Goldstone further expressed regret "that our fact-finding mission did not have such evidence explaining the circumstances in which we said civilians in Gaza were targeted, because it probably would have influenced our findings about intentionality and war crimes." Goldstone's revised view concerned the intentional targeting of civilians, not other war crimes alleged in the report to have been committed by Israel. Such other crimes included causing civilian casualties by using a disproportionate level of force and attacks on buildings concerning which there was no indication they were legitimate military targets. <ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/04/201144185658205605.html Goldstone recants, but how much is changed? (Al Jazeera, 05 Apr 2011)]</ref> . 

In acknowledging the history of anti-Israel bias of the UN Human Rights Council, Goldstone added: "That comparatively few Israelis have been killed by the unlawful rocket and mortar attacks from Gaza in no way minimizes the criminality. The U.N. Human Rights Council should condemn these heinous acts in the strongest terms." . 

Goldstone wrote that "If I had known then what I know now, the Goldstone Report would have been a different document." He said that the lack of Israeli cooperation had meant that no Israeli officers were interviewed during the writing of the report. In hindsight, incidents which had been interpreted as the deliberate targeting of civilians may have had other explanations, such as poor intelligence information. Goldstone also praised Israel for investigating claims of war crimes while faulting Hamas for its failure to launch any investigations of its own forces. Goldstone commended Israel for responding to his report by revising military procedures to e.g. limit the use of white phosphorus in civilian areas. <ref name="WP0401">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/reconsidering-the-goldstone-report-on-israel-and-war-crimes/2011/04/01/AFg111JC_story.html|title=Reconsidering the Goldstone Report on Israel and war crimes' |publisher=''[[Washington Post]]''|date=2011-04-01|author=Richard Goldstone|accessdate=2011-04-01}}</ref> . 

Goldstone also expressed that he initially hoped the "inquiry into all aspects of the Gaza conflict would begin a new era of evenhandedness at the U.N. Human Rights Council, whose history of bias against Israel cannot be doubted". <ref name="WP0401" /> . 

===Reactions===. 
Response in Israel to Goldstone's reappraisal of the report was harsh with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu releasing a statement saying that the report should be thrown "into the dustbin of history" and Jerusalem Post editor David Horovitz writing that Goldstone had "produced a report that has caused such irreversible damage to Israel’s good name" that the very least that Goldstone now owes Israel "is to work unstintingly from now on to try to undo the damage he has caused". <ref>http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=214864</ref>
<ref>http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=214866</ref> UN human rights council spokesman Cedric Sapey stated  "The UN will not revoke a report on the basis of an article in a newspaper. The views Mr Goldstone expressed are his own personal views." Sapey explained "A move to change or withdraw the report would either require a formal written complaint from Goldstone, backed unanimously by his three fellow authors, or a vote by the UN general assembly or the human rights council". <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/05/goldstone-gaza-report-stands-un | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Ed | last1=Pilkington | first2=Conal | last2=Urquhart | title=Gaza,Israel (News),Middle East (News),Palestinian territories (News),World news,Law,War crimes,Human rights | date=5 April 2011}}</ref>
However, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri dismissed Goldstone's remarks saying that "his retreat does not change the fact war crimes had been committed against 1.5 million people in Gaza," while Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad aL-Malki said Goldstone's comments did not change a thing and that "The report was as clear as the crimes that Israel committed during the war". <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2011/04/02/world/middleeast/international-us-israel-un-gaza.html?scp=1&sq=goldstone&st=nyt | work=The New York Times}}</ref> . 

Hina Jilani, one of the four writers of the "Goldstone Report", noted when asked if the report should allegedly be changed: "Absolutely not; no process or acceptable procedure would invalidate the UN Report; if it does happen, it would be seen as a 'suspect move'." <ref>http://www.pakistantimes.net/pt/detail.php?newsId=20465 UN report on Gaza conflict stands unchanged: Hina Jilani  (Pakistan Times, April 6, 2011)</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/06/world/middleeast/06goldstone.html?_r=1&ref=middleeast Head of Gaza Inquiry Is Said to Plan Israel Trip (New York Times, April 5, 2011)]</ref>  Also another of the four co-writer's, Irish international criminal investigations expert Desmond Travers, noted: 'the tenor of the report in its entirety, in my opinion, stands'. <ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/un-council-goldstone-regret-not-enough-to-rescind-gaza-war-report-1.354070 UN council: Goldstone regret not enough to rescind Gaza war report (Haaretz, April 5, 2011)]</ref> Also Goldstone maintained that, although the one correction should be made, he had "no reason to believe any part of the report needs to be reconsidered at this time" and that he didn't plan to pursue nullifying the report. <ref>[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2014686085_apmlisraelunreport.html?syndication=rss Goldstone won't seek Gaza report nullification (Associated Press, April 6, 2011)]</ref> . 

Human rights organizations said that much of the report remained valid. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/world/middleeast/04goldstone.html?_r=1&ref=middleeast Israel Grapples With Retraction on U.N. Report (New York Times, April 3, 2011)]</ref> . 

[[American Jewish Committee]] (AJC) Executive Director, David Harris, said that "Judge Goldstone should apologize to the State of Israel for the accusations of intentionally targeting civilians, which he now admits were unfounded. He should present his updated conclusions to the UN Human Rights Council, as well as to the General Assembly, which endorsed the skewed report, and press for its rejection."<ref>[http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=214926&R=R4 US Jewish groups urge Goldstone to retract report]</ref> . 

In addition, [[NGO Monitor]] President Professor [[Gerald Steinberg]] said "with Goldstone's admission that 'our fact-finding mission had no evidence' and that 'civilians were not intentionally targeted as a matter of policy,' the politicized NGOs that supplied these allegations have been exposed again as biased and lacking credibility. As NGO Monitor demonstrated<ref>[http://www.ngo-monitor.org/article/goldstone_and_ngos Goldstone and NGOs]</ref> when the report was released, the so-called 'evidence' provided by these groups was at the core of the political war against Israel."<ref>[http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=214926&R=R4 US Jewish groups urge Goldstone to retract report]</ref> . 

===Statement issued by other members of UN mission=== . 

On the 14th of April 2011 the other three authors of the Goldstone report released a statement regarding Goldstones article in the Washington post.Hina Jilani, Christine Chinkin and Desmond Travers claimed that "in recent days some articles and comments appearing in the press with respect to the report of the United Nations (UN) fact-finding mission on the Gaza conflict of 2008-2009 have misrepresented facts in an attempt to delegitimise the findings of this report and to cast doubts on its credibility".  . 

The 3 co authors of the report wanted to address the "aspersions cast on the findings of the report and challenge them. Members of the mission, signatories to this statement, find it necessary to dispel any impression that subsequent developments have rendered any part of the mission's report unsubstantiated, erroneous or inaccurate".  . 

Hina Jilani, Christine Chinkin and Desmond Travers claimed there is "no justification for any demand or expectation for reconsideration of the report as nothing of substance has appeared that would in any way change the context, findings or conclusions of that report with respect to any of the parties to the Gaza conflict. Indeed, there is no UN procedure or precedent to that effect".  . 

They stated that "The report of the fact-finding mission contains the conclusions made after diligent, independent and objective consideration of the information related to the events within our mandate, and careful assessment of its reliability and credibility. We firmly stand by these conclusions".  . 

They concluded that Israel and Hamas have yet to establish a convincing basis for any claims that contradict the findings of the mission's report contradicting Goldstones claims.  . 

They pointed out that "many of those calling for the nullification of our report imply that the final report by the follow-up committee's two members, Judge Mary McGowan Davis and Judge Lennart Aspergren, presented to the human rights council in March 2011, somehow contradicts the fact-finding mission's report or invalidates it.  . 

In the light of the observations of this committee such claims are completely misplaced, and a clear distortion of their findings".  . 

They criticized the findings of the Israeli inquiries. "The committee's report states that, according to available information, Israel has conducted some 400 command investigations into allegations by the fact-finding mission and other organisations. Command investigations are operational, not legal, inquiries and are conducted by personnel from the same command structure as those under investigation. Out of these, the committee reports that 52 criminal investigations into allegations of wrongdoings have been opened. Of these, three have been submitted for prosecution, with two of them resulting in convictions (one for theft of a credit card, resulting in a sentence of seven months' imprisonment, and another for using a Palestinian child as a human shield, which resulted in a suspended sentence of three months). The third case, related to allegations of deliberate targeting of an individual waving a white flag, is still ongoing".  . 

"The committee has expressed serious concerns about the late start and slow pace of the proceedings, their insufficient transparency and the participation of victims and witnesses. Out of the 36 incidents relating to Gaza described in the fact-finding mission report, more than one third remain unresolved or without a clear status over two years after the conflict. The committee concluded that the slow progress could seriously impair the effectiveness of the investigations and prospects of achieving justice and accountability. Therefore, the mechanisms that are being used by the Israeli authorities to investigate the incidents are proving inadequate to genuinely ascertain the facts and any ensuing legal responsibility".  . 

The authors also stated that "In addition, with regard to the issue of the policies guiding Operation Cast Lead, the committee states that there is "no indication that Israel has opened investigations into the actions of those who designed, planned, ordered and oversaw Operation Cast Lead". In other words, one of the most serious allegations about the conduct of Israel's military operations remains completely unaddressed".  . 

They also criticized Hamas "We regret that no domestic investigations at all have been started into any of the allegations of international crimes committed by members of Palestinian armed groups in Gaza which have fired thousands of rockets into southern Israel. The committee observes the same in its report".  . 

Their statement concluded with "We consider that calls to reconsider or even retract the report, as well as attempts at misrepresenting its nature and purpose, disregard the right of victims, Palestinian and Israeli, to truth and justice. They also ignore the responsibility of the relevant parties under international law to conduct prompt, thorough, effective and independent investigations. We regret the personal attacks and the extraordinary pressure placed on members of the fact-finding mission since we began our work in May 2009. This campaign has been clearly aimed at undermining the integrity of the report and its authors. Had we given in to pressures from any quarter to sanitise our conclusions, we would be doing a serious injustice to the hundreds of innocent civilians killed during the Gaza conflict, the thousands injured, and the hundreds of thousands whose lives continue to be deeply affected by the conflict and the blockade.  . 

The report has triggered a process that is still under way and should continue until justice is done and respect for international human rights and humanitarian law by everyone is ensured". <ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/apr/14/goldstone-report-statement-un-gaza Goldstone report: Statement issued by members of UN mission on Gaza war (The Guardian, April 14, 2011)]</ref> .
