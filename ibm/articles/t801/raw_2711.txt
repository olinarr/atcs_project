Accusations of violations regarding [[international humanitarian law]], which governs the actions by [[belligerents]] during an armed conflict, have been directed at both [[Israel]] and [[Hamas]] for their actions during the [[Gaza War]]. The accusations covered violating laws governing [[Distinction (law)|distinction]] and [[proportionality (international humanitarian law)|proportionality]] by Israel, the indiscriminate firing of rockets at civilian locations and [[2009 Hamas political violence in Gaza|extrajudicial violence]] within the Gaza Strip by Hamas. <ref name="AI_briefing">{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE15/007/2009/en/4c407b40-e64c-11dd-9917-ed717fa5078d/mde150072009en.html|title=Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territories: The conflict in Gaza: A briefing on applicable law, investigations and accountability|date=2009-01-19|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|accessdate=2009-06-05}}</ref><ref name="Under Cover of War"/> As of September 2009, some 360 complaints had been filed by individuals and [[NGO]]s at the prosecutor's office in [[the Hague]] calling for investigations into alleged crimes committed by Israel during the Gaza War. <ref name=JTA1>{{cite web|title=Palestinian teen accuses Israel in The Hague|date=September 1, 2009|url=http://jta.org/news/article/2009/09/01/1007573/palestinian-girl-accuses-israel-in-the-hague|accessdate=2009-09-01}}</ref> .

===Report by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights===. 
The Human Rights Council ordered a series of periodic reports aimed to assess the human rights situation in the occupied [[Palestinian Territories]] (OPT) following Israel's military operation. The first of the reports was set to be presented to the Council in September 2009. <ref name="UN official: Evidence that Israel abused human rights in Gaza">{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1107634.html|title=UN official: Evidence that Israel abused human rights in Gaza|publisher=[[Ha'aretz]]|date=15 August 2009}}</ref> The report, compiled by [[UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]] [[Navi Pillay]], alleges that the [[Israeli Defence Force]] breached laws of armed conflict by attacking indiscriminately civilians in at least several incidents, by targeting civilian and protected facilities, by damaging large number of buildings, by failing to provide unquestionably effective warning to civilians at risk and by failing to implement rules of international humanitarian law regarding [[military occupation]]. The report also states that indiscriminate rocket attacks, as well as ill-treatment and extrajudicial execution of detainees by Palestinian armed groups, constitute violations of [[laws of war]]. <ref name="Human Rights Situation in Palestine">[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/12session/A%20HRC%2012%2037_AEV.pdf Human Rights Situation in Palestine], UNHRC, 13 August 2009. </ref> Navi Pillay also expressed a hope that the upcoming report by the fact-finding mission led by Judge Goldstone would serve as a basis for indicting the alleged perpetrators of the [[war crimes]] in the [[International Criminal Court]]. <ref name="INTERVIEW-CIA probe must go to highest level-UN rights boss">[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/LR218160.htm INTERVIEW-CIA probe must go to highest level-UN rights boss], Reuters, 27 August 2009. </ref> . 

===Collective punishment===. 
The UN Human Rights Council as well as many non-governmental organizations and notable figures, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have accused Israel of imposing [[Fourth Geneva Convention#Collective punishments|collective punishment]] on the population of Gaza by the blockade, invasion and bombardment of Gaza. <ref name="UN_RFalk"/><ref name="Israel’s bombardment of Gaza is not self-defence – it’s a war crime">[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/letters/article5488380.ece Israel’s bombardment of Gaza is not self-defence – it’s a war crime], The Sunday Times, January 11, 2009</ref> [[Michael I. Krauss]], Professor of Law at [[George Mason University School of Law]] and [[Abraham Bell]], Director of the International Law Forum at the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], argue that the bar on collective punishment forbids the imposition of criminal or military penalties (imprisonment, death, etc.) on some people for crimes committed by other individuals, leading to the conclusion that none of Israel's actions involve the imposition of criminal-type penalties. <ref name="Collective Punishment and Newspeak">[http://www.americanthinker.com/2008/02/collective_punishment_and_news.html Collective Punishment and Newspeak], American Thinker, February 24, 2008</ref><ref name="International Law and Gaza: The Assault on Israel's Right to Self-Defense">[http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DRIT=1&DBID=1&LNGID=1&TMID=111&FID=378&PID=0&IID=2021&TTL=International_Law_and_Gaza:_The_Assault_on_Israel’s_Right_to_Self-Defense International Law and Gaza: The Assault on Israel's Right to Self-Defense], JCPA, January 28, 2009</ref> . 

===Attacks on civilians and civilian objects (the principle of distinction)===. 
Israel has been criticized for violating laws covering distinction. Israel has stated that "anything affiliated with Hamas is a legitimate target."<ref name=bbc2009jan5 /> This has been criticized as being too broad. [[Amnesty International]] (AI) has said that this definition includes, "presumptively civilian" targets such as government ministries that serve no military purpose. <ref name="AI_briefing" /> Israel has said that these government ministries and the parliament building are part of the Hamas infrastructure and as such legitimate targets. B'Tselem describes Israel's reasoning as being "legally flawed," stating that simple Hamas' affiliation does not make such locations legitimate targets. <ref name=bbc2009jan5>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7811386.stm |title=Gaza conflict: Who is a civilian? |publisher=BBC News|date=January 5, 2009|author=Heather Sharp |location=Jerusalem}}</ref> [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]] (JCPA) asserted that under various provisions on International Law (e.g., UN Security Council Resolution 1566), Palestinian governing authorities in Gaza, whether directly involved in terror attacks or not, are criminal terrorists, by virtue of their willing provision of finance, plan, support and safe haven for terrorists. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globallawforum.org/ViewPublication.aspx?ArticleId=87 |title=International Law and the Fighting in Gaza |publisher=Globallawforum.org |date=2008-02-07 |accessdate=2011-03-27}}</ref> 
AI and B'Tselem point out that in many instances, IDF targeted civilian buildings without providing explanation for the attack, and some of such attacks raise the strong possibility that Israel may have violated the prohibition against targeting objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population. <ref name="amnesty.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE15/007/2009/en/4c407b40-e64c-11dd-9917-ed717fa5078d/mde150072009en.html |title=Document - Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territories: The conflict in Gaza: A briefing on applicable law, investigations and accountability &#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-27}}</ref> AI asserts that those instances would violate Articles 51, 52 and 54 of [[Protocol I]]. <ref name="amnesty.org"/> A [[Center for Strategic International Studies]] report notes that the IDF admits it did hit some purely civilian targets, including UN facilities, but says that it is not clear that combatants were not in or near such targets; CSIS also claims that the laws of war require an effort to discriminate, and not perfect success. <ref name="AnthonyHCordesman"/> AI further notes that Israel’s firing of artillery, shelling from tanks and from naval ships into densely populated civilian areas in Gaza may also amount to indiscriminate attacks. <ref name="AI_briefing" /> Retired U.S. Army colonel said however that the number of artillery rounds was low, indicating considerable restraint from the IDF, and that from military perspective he believes that things could not have been done any differently. <ref name="Adapting Artillery to Urban War">[http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=4001228 Adapting Artillery to Urban War], Defense News, March 23, 2009</ref>   . 

In June 2009, HRW issued a report entitled "Precisely wrong", presenting an investigation of six [[UAV]] attacks that resulted in large civilian death. <ref name="Report: IDF used RPV fire to target civilians">[http://www.ynet.co.il/english/Ext/Comp/ArticleLayout/CdaArticlePrintPreview/1,2506,L-3739125,00.html Report: IDF used RPV fire to target civilians], YNET, 30 June 2009</ref> HRW concluded that in the cases probed, Israeli forces either failed to take all feasible precautions to verify that the targets were combatants, or failed to distinguish between combatants and civilians and to target only the former; as a result, HRW deduce that these attacks were a violation of International Humanitarian Law. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2009/06/30/precisely-wrong-0 |title=Precisely Wrong &#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=2009-06-30 |accessdate=2011-03-27}}</ref> The report methodology included interviews with victims and witnesses, investigations of the attack sites and IDF and media reports; the probes were based on the presumption that the impact mark  and the fragmentation patterns were consistent with the Israeli-produced Spike missile that are used by the drones. <ref name="Precisely Wrong - Overview">[http://www.hrw.org/en/node/84077/section/3 Precisely Wrong - Overview], HRW, June 30, 2009</ref> The Israeli military did not cooperate with HRW on the report and said that the report appeared to be based on "unnamed and unreliable Palestinian sources" whose military expertise was "unproven". <ref name="Report: IDF used RPV fire to target civilians"/> Spike's manufacturer, Israeli concern [[Rafael]], says the missile can be fired not only by drones, but by helicopters, infantry units and naval craft. <ref name="Human Rights Watch accuses Israel over Gaza drones">[http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSLU55228 Human Rights Watch accuses Israel over Gaza drones], Reuters, 30 June 2009</ref> Several military experts said that drones may reach operational heights of 4,000 metres; the launch of a missile at that altitude would likely elude the naked eye. <ref name="Human Rights Watch accuses Israel over Gaza drones2">[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/LU55228.htm Human Rights Watch accuses Israel over Gaza drones2], Reuters, June 30, 2009</ref> HRW military expert also conceded that two of the incidents cited took place in the evening or night, something that could potentially rule out anyone seeing the small aircraft. <ref name="Human Rights Watch accuses Israel over Gaza drones"/> . 

In July 2009, Amnesty released 117-page report that was based on physical evidence and testimony gathered by a team of four researchers, including a military expert, from dozens of attack sites in Gaza and southern Israel during and after the war. <ref name="22 Days of Death and Destruction">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/02_07_09_gaza_report.pdf 22 Days of Death and Destruction], Amnesty, July 2009</ref> The pattern of Israeli attacks and the high number of civilian casualties "showed elements of reckless conduct, disregard for civilian lives and property and a consistent failure to distinguish between military targets and civilians and civilian objects," Amnesty charged. <ref name="Israel and Hamas 'both guilty of war crimes' - Amnesty">[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6621805.ece Israel and Hamas 'both guilty of war crimes' - Amnesty], July 2, 2009, Times</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6621805.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Israel and Hamas both guilty of war crimes Amnesty | date=2009-07-02 | accessdate=2010-05-05}}</ref> The group said that hundreds of Palestinian civilians were killed using high-precision weapons, while others were shot at close range. <ref name="Amnesty details Gaza 'war crimes'">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8128210.stm Amnesty details Gaza 'war crimes'], BBC, July 2, 2009</ref> The IDF responded that the report ignores the efforts the military made to minimize harm to innocent civilians that included millions of flyers, personal phone calls to homes of Palestinians and radio broadcasts to warn civilians of the impending operation. <ref name="Hamas, Israel reject Amnesty claims">[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1246443696703&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull Hamas, Israel reject Amnesty claims], July 1, 2009</ref> . 

In August 2009, HRW published a report that deals with seven incidents in which 11 Palestinian civilians, including 5 women and 4 children, were killed by Israeli soldiers despite the fact that they were waiving white flags supposedly visible to the IDF. According to the testimonies on which the report is based, the IDF was in control of the areas in which the incidents occurred, no fighting was taking place at the when they occurred and no armed people traveled among the civilians. <ref name="Report: IDF killed women and children with white flags in Gaza">[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3761371,00.html Report: IDF killed women and children with white flags in Gaza], YNET, August 13, 2009</ref> HRW researches concluded that the Israeli soldiers at best failed to protect civilians, and at worst deliberately shot at them. <ref name="Gaza white flag deaths probe call">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8198863.stm Gaza white flag deaths probe call], BBC, August 13, 2009</ref> In one of the cases mentioned in the report, on January 7, Israeli soldiers shot and killed two of the girls of the Abd Rabbo family (aged 2 and 7), wounding the third girl (aged 4) and their grandmother. <ref name="IDF dismisses Cast Lead claims">[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1249418596650&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull IDF dismisses Cast Lead claims] JPost, August 13, 2009</ref> Pro-Israeli NGOs [[Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America|CAMERA]] and [[NGO Monitor]] found out significant contradictions between the testimonies of the family members and the neighbors that were told HRW and the reports of the incident published in numerous newspapers in winter 2009. <ref name="CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY">[http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AWXYV56qlacKZGdwYzRoYzlfMTMzaG5mamJ3Y2o&hl=en CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY], Maariv, 21 August 2009</ref> In a response to the report, the Israeli military said its soldiers were obligated to avoid harming anyone waving a white flag, but that in some cases Hamas militants had used civilians with white flags for cover. In correlation with the statement, the IDF uploaded a video to the internet depicting what it said was a Hamas gunman planting an explosive device and then attempting to take shelter in a home of uninvolved civilians waving white flags during fighting in Gaza. <ref name="Rights group: IDF killed Gazans waving 'white flags' during war">[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1107286.html Rights group: IDF killed Gazans waving 'white flags' during war], Haaretz, August 13, 2009</ref> Nevertheless, as of September 2009, the IDF is investigating several similar allegations, including the complaint filed by the Al-Mezan Center for Human Rights on behalf of the Abd Rabbo family. <ref name="Military Police begin probing Gaza 'white-flag' deaths">[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1251804514229&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull Military Police begin probing Gaza 'white-flag' deaths], JPost, September 8, 2009</ref> . 

====Attacks on civil police====. 
HRW points out that under international humanitarian law, police are presumed to be civilian - and thus immune from attack - unless formally incorporated into the armed forces of a party to a conflict or directly participating in the hostilities. <ref name="Q & A on Hostilities between Israel and Hamas">{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/12/31/q-hostilities-between-israel-and-hamas#_May_Israel_lawfully|title=Q & A on Hostilities between Israel and Hamas|date=31 December 2008|publisher=HRW}}</ref> HRW representative stated that a decision that police and police stations are legitimate military targets depends on whether those police play a role in fighting against Israel, or whether a particular police station is used to store weapons or for some other military purpose. <ref name="hrw_civilians_release">{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/12/30/israelgaza-civilians-must-not-be-targets|title=Israel/Gaza: Civilians must not be tagets|date=2008-12-30|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref>  IDF stated that it perceives police in Gaza as equivalent to the enemy's armed force and as such legitimate targets. <ref name="Consent and advise">{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1059925.html|title=Consent and advise |date=2009-02-05|publisher=Haaretz|accessdate=2009-06-05}}</ref> Israeli [[Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center]] (ITIC) alleged that the distinction between the internal security forces and Hamas military wing is not sharply defined and cites Gaza police officials who said that police were instructed to fight the enemy in case of an invasion into the Gaza Strip. <ref name="Mounting evidence indicates">{{cite web|url=http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/malam_multimedia/English/eng_n/html/hamas_e067.htm|title=Mounting evidence indicates|date=24 March 2009|publisher=ITIC}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/10/world/middleeast/10mideast.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | title=Hamas in Largest Arms Buildup Yet, Israeli Study Says | first=Ethan | last=Bronner | date=2008-04-10 | accessdate=2010-05-05}}</ref> Many security force members were reported to "moonlight" with the Izzidin al-Qassam Brigades. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jan/01/world/fg-gaza-scene1 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Gaza police back on the beat amid Israeli attacks | first1=Ashraf | last1=Khalil | first2=Ahmed | last2=Burai | date=2009-01-01 | accessdate=2010-05-05}}</ref> [[Amnesty International]] criticized Israel for targeting and killing large number of civilian police. <ref name="AI_briefing" /> One of the traffic course trainees who had participated in the ceremony attacked by [[IAF]] on 27 December 2008, told [[B'Tselem]] that they were trained in first-aid and in maintaining order. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.btselem.org/Download/200902_Operation_Cast_Lead_Position_paper_Eng.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Cast_Final _3__LASTTT.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-03-27}}</ref> The Israeli 'Orient Research Group' claimed that 78 of the 89 killed during the first IAF strike were terror operatives, many of them belonging to the al-Qassam Brigades. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3720759,00.html |title=Report: Most Hamas 'officers' killed in Gaza were terrorists - Israel News, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=1995-06-20 |accessdate=2011-03-27}}</ref> In an update published in September 2009, JCPA claims that among the total of 343 members of the Palestinian security forces who were killed, 286 have been identified as terror organization members. <ref name="Palestinian ">[http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DRIT=1&DBID=1&LNGID=1&TMID=111&FID=442&PID=0&IID=3081&TTL=Palestinian_“Policemen”_Killed_in_Gaza_Operation_Were_Trained_Terrorists Palestinian "Policemen" Killed in Gaza Operation Were Trained Terrorists], JCPA, September 13, 2009</ref> . 

The [[Goldstone Report]] concluded that while there were many individual Gaza policemen who were members of militant groups, the Gaza police forces were a civilian police force and "cannot be said to have been taking a direct part in hostilities and thus did not lose their civilian immunity from direct attack as civilians". <ref name=UNFFMGCReport_pdf>{{cite news|url=http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2009/09/15/UNFFMGCReport.pdf|title=Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict|publisher=United Nations Human Rights Council|accessdate=2009-09-15 | location=London}}</ref> The report did not "rule out the possibility that there might be individuals in the police force who retain their links to the armed groups" but finds no evidence that the police were part of the Gaza armed forces and that it "could not verify the allegations of membership of armed groups of policemen."<ref name=UNFFMGCReport_pdf /> NGO [[UN Watch]] noted that the Goldstone Report relies on the testimony of the Gaza police spokesperson Islam Shahwan and accepts the interpretation of his own words "face the enemy" as meaning "distributing food stuffs". <ref name="Goldstone report cites same Hamas witness who claims Israel distributes libido-increasing gum">[http://blog.unwatch.org/?p=474 Goldstone report cites same Hamas witness who claims Israel distributes libido-increasing gum], UN Watch, 29 September 2009</ref> In the initial response to the fact-finding mission's report, issued on 24 September 2009, Israeli Government further added that "in seeking to support its assertion" that the police in Gaza were a civilian police force, not only did the committee reinterpreted some of the evidences, but also ignored other explicit statements of the police officials, e.g. the alleged admission by Hamas police chief Jamal al-Jarrah that "the police took part in the fighting alongside the resistance". <ref name="INITIAL RESPONSE TO REPORT OF THE FACT FINDING MISSION ON GAZA">[http://www.mfa.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/FC985702-61C4-41C9-8B72-E3876FEF0ACA/0/GoldstoneReportInitialResponse240909.pdf INITIAL RESPONSE TO REPORT OF THE FACT FINDING MISSION ON GAZA], IMFA, 24 September 2009</ref> . 

===The principle of proportionality===. 
Amnesty stated that some attacks on homes of Hamas leaders have killed dozens of civilians, even though it should have been apparent to Israeli forces that the target of attack was not likely to be present or that civilians were likely to be killed in the attack. AI asserted that such conduct may amount to disproportionate attacks, a type of indiscriminate attack, that “may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated” ([[s:Protocol I#Art 51. - Protection of the civilian population|Article 51]](5b) of Additional [[Protocol I]]). <ref name="AI_briefing" /> The official report of the Israeli Government, published in July 2009, notes that while Israel is not a party to the Protocol I, Israel however accepts its provisions as reflective of customary international law. <ref name="FACTUAL AND LEGAL ASPECTS">[http://www.mfa.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/E89E699D-A435-491B-B2D0-017675DAFEF7/0/GazaOperation.pdf FACTUAL AND LEGAL ASPECTS], IMFA, 30 July 2009</ref> A senior legal adviser in Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs points out that a standard practice in assessing the anticipated military advantage, as was established by committee to review NATO bombings in Yugoslavia, is that of 'reasonable military commander' rather than a human rights lawyer. <ref name="The inadequacy of international law">[http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/05/07/the_inadequacy_of_international_law/ The inadequacy of international law The inadequacy of international law], The Boston Globe, May 07 2009</ref> Professor Newton, expert in laws of warfare testifying in front of the Goldstone committee, said that in order to properly examine a proportionality assessment, the relevant question is what information was available to the commander at the time the attack was authorized. <ref name="Public hearings – Geneva, Afternoon Session of 7 July 2009">[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/2009.07.07PM_Session.doc Public hearings – Geneva, Afternoon Session of 7 July 2009], UNHRC</ref>  . 

[[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]] (JCPA) asserts that the rule of distinction permits attacking legitimate targets, even if the attack is expected to cause collateral damage to civilians and even if, in retrospect, the attack was a mistake based on faulty intelligence; moreover, [[s:Geneva Convention/Fourth Geneva Convention#Article 28|Article 28]] of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] makes clear that the presence of civilians “may not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations". <ref name="International Law and the Fighting in Gaza"/> CSIS report notes that Israel planned its air and air-land campaigns in ways that clearly discriminated between military and civilian targets and that were intended to limit civilian casualties and collateral damage, by systematic and comprehensive use of its IS&R assets, careful mapping, GPS abilities and guidance from targeting experts briefed in the laws and conventions of war; the report concludes that this aspect of the IDF‘s actions met the key legal test that the anticipated military advantage did not outweigh the risk to civilians. <ref name="AnthonyHCordesman"/> Israeli Government report further adds that on numerous occasions a last-minute decision not to attack legitimate military targets or to divert missiles moments before the impact was upheld to avoid the possibility of civilian harm, even though such an attack might not be excessive in relation to the anticipated military advantage. The report claims that the IDF also refrained from attacking [[al-Shifa Hospital]] in Gaza City, despite alleged Hamas’ use of an entire ground floor wing as its headquarters, out of concern for the inevitable harm to civilians present in the hospital. <ref name="FACTUAL AND LEGAL ASPECTS"/> . 

===Food, medical supplies and relief===. 
AI accused Israel of failure to provide adequate supply of food, essential supplies, medicine and medical care to the population of Gaza, as well as deliberate impediment of emergency relief and humanitarian assistance. <ref name="AI_briefing" /> JCPA asserted that according to [[s:Geneva Convention/Fourth Geneva Convention#Article 23|Article 23]] of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]], Israel is under no obligation to provide anything itself; Israel is only required not to interfere with passage of food and so forth sent by others for the benefit of children under age fifteen, mothers of newborns and pregnant women; under Article 23, a party can block passage even of food, clothing and medicine even for these population groups if it has serious grounds for suspecting that the items will be intercepted before reaching their destination. <ref name="International Law and the Fighting in Gaza"/> Several instances of Hamas seizing convoys of humanitarian aid were reported before and in the course of the fighting. <ref name="Hamas seizes aid meant for Red Crescent">{{cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3504227,00.html|title=Hamas seizes aid meant for Red Crescent|date=2008-02-07|publisher=YNET}}</ref><ref name="Hamas raids aid trucks, sells supplies">{{cite news|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&cid=1231424932109|title=Hamas Hamas raids aid trucks, sells supplies|date=2009-01-12|publisher=JPOST}}</ref> Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed that more than 37,000 tons of humanitarian aid were allowed to Gaza from Israel and that numerous efforts for providing medical help took place during the war. <ref name="Humanitarian aid to Gaza during IDF operation">{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Hamas+war+against+Israel/Humanitarian_aid_to_Gaza_following_6_month_calm.htm|title=Humanitarian aid to Gaza during IDF operation|date=2009-01-18|publisher=Israel MFA}}</ref> The emergency clinic, opened at the Erez crossing at the end of the fighting, was shut down shortly due to the low number of Palestinian patients, supposedly as a the result of a direct order by Hamas not to transfer the wounded to Israel. <ref name="Israel to close clinic at Erez crossing">{{cite news|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3662288,00.html|title=Israel to close clinic at Erez crossing |date=2009-01-27|publisher=YNET}}</ref> . 

===Destruction of homes and property===. 
AI points out that according to [[s:Geneva Convention/Fourth Geneva Convention#Article 53|Article 53]] of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]], destruction of homes and property of Palestinians is forbidden, unless it is militarily necessary to do so; unjustified violation of the prohibition is, in accodance with [[s:Geneva Convention/Fourth Geneva Convention#Article 147|Article 147]], a grave breach of the IHL. <ref name="AI_briefing" /> The comprehensive [[Amnesty International]] report, published in July 2009, notes that the destruction of homes, businesses and public buildings during Israeli offensive was in many cases "wanton and deliberate" and "could not be justified on the grounds of military necessity". The report stated that more than 3,000 homes were destroyed and approximately 20,000 were damaged. <ref name="Amnesty details Gaza 'war crimes'" /> Deliberations by the IDF during the conflict resulted in a decision that striking homes supposedly used to store weapons, when "sufficient warning" is given to the residents, falls within the boundaries of international law and is therefore legitimate, citing [[s:Protocol I#Art 52. General Protection of civilian objects|Article 52(2)]] of [[Protocol I]] of the [[Geneva Conventions]], which defines a site being used for military activities as a legitimate target. <ref name="Ynet_sufficient_warning">{{cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3648848,00.html|title=Hamas leader, 20 Palestinians killed in IAF strikes|date=2009-01-09|publisher=Ynet|accessdate=2009-01-09}}</ref> .

He stated that "the quality of smoke produced by white phosphorus is superb; if you want real smoke for real coverage, white phosphorus will give it to you". <ref name="Public hearings – Geneva, Afternoon Session of 7 July 2009"/> Professor Newton, expert in laws of armed conflict testifying in front of the committee, said that in an urban area, where potential perils are snipers, explosive devices and trip wires, one effective way to mask forces' movement is by white phosphorus. In certain cases, he added, such choice of means would be least harmful for civilian population, provided that the use of white phosphorus withstands the proportionality test. He also stressed that the white phosphorus munition is neither chemical nor incendiary weapon. <ref name="Public hearings – Geneva, Afternoon Session of 7 July 2009"/>  . 

Donatella Rovera, Amnesty’s researcher on Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories said that such extensive use of this weapon in Gaza's densely populated residential neighbourhoods is inherently indiscriminate. "Its repeated use in this manner, despite evidence of its indiscriminate effects and its toll on civilians, is a war crime," she said. <ref>[http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/israeli-armys-use-white-phosphorus-gaza-clear-undeniable-20090119 Israel used white phosphorus in Gaza civilian areas] Amnesty International (19 January 2009) Retrieved 30th May 2011</ref> . 

On March 25, [[Human Rights Watch]], published a report titled Rain of Fire, Israel’s Unlawful Use of White Phosphorus in Gaza providing, "witness accounts of the devastating effects that white phosphorus munitions had on civilians and civilian property in Gaza."<ref>[http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2009/03/25/rain-fire Rain of Fire, Israel’s Unlawful Use of White Phosphorus in Gaza]</ref> . 

The Israeli government released a report in July 2009 that stated that the IDF used white phosphorus in exploding munitions and smoke projectiles. The report stated that the use of exploding munitions were used by Israeli ground and naval forces. The report defended the use of these munition stating that they were only fired on unpopulated areas for marking and signaling and not as an anti-personnel weapon. <ref name="mfa_gazaop_paper_july2009">{{cite web |title=THE OPERATION IN GAZA, 27 DECEMBER 2008 – 18 JANUARY 2009 FACTUAL AND LEGAL ASPECTS|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/E89E699D-A435-491B-B2D0-017675DAFEF7/0/GazaOperation.pdf |publisher=[[Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |date=2009-07-29}}</ref> The report further says that the main type of munitions containing white phosphorus employed by the IDF during the Gaza Operation was smoke screening projectiles, which are smoke shells containing felt wedges dipped in white phosphorus. The report suggests that the use of smoke obscurants proved to be highly effective at cloaking IDF forces while obstructing enemy lines of sight and that at no time did IDF forces have the objective of inflicting any harm on the civilian population. <ref name="FACTUAL AND LEGAL ASPECTS"/> . 

Amnesty International stated that the Israeli army used [[flechette]] shells in densely populated civilian areas resulting in the injuries and deaths of civilians. The anti-personnel weapon spreads up to 8000 4&nbsp;cm long metal darts over a 30,000 square meter area. <ref>[http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/israeli-army-used-flechettes-against-gaza-civilians-20090127 Israeli army used flechettes against Gaza civilians] [[Amnesty International]], January 27, 2009. </ref> The army has argued that it has used the weapons very selectively. <ref>[http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,6119,2-10-1462_1347525,00.htm ]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref> Use of the munition is not forbidden under international law. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/feb/23/israel-palestinian-territories | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Israel's use of force was justified | date=2009-02-24 | accessdate=2010-05-05 | first=Uri | last=Dromi}}</ref> . 

Military expert told Goldstone team that there is no proof that Dense Inert Metal Explosive (DIME) rounds were used, but he is of view that some weapons systems used in the conflict had some sort of DIME component, citing evidence of tungsten, iron, and sulfur in samples analyzed in a forensic lab. He made it clear the intent of Israel if it did indeed use these weapons was to reduce civilian casualties; however, those within the area of dispersal will experience catastrophic injuries, possibly leading to multiple amputations. <ref name="Public hearings – Geneva, Afternoon Session of 7 July 2009">[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/2009.07.07PM_Session.doc Public hearings – Geneva, Afternoon Session of 7 July 2009]</ref>   . 

[[John Stanley (politician)|Sir John Stanley]], a British Member of Parliament and an ex-cabinet member who served as the Minister of State for the Armed Forces for eight years, considers the use of DIME weapons a stealth method of killing and to breach Protocol 1 of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons to which Israel is a signatory. <ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_U_EMOisbTYC&pg=RA1-PA14&dq=legality+of+Dense+Inert+Metal+Explosive&ei=x1eGS-S6HpaWNYnEtNEM&cd=2#v=onepage&q=legality%20of%20Dense%20Inert%20Metal%20Explosive&f=false Global security: Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories] Great Britain: Parliament: House of Commons: Foreign Affairs Committee - Oral evident  page 14; see also [http://www.unog.ch/80256EE600585943/(httpPages)/4F0DEF093B4860B4C1257180004B1B30?OpenDocument The Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons] and [http://www.unog.ch/__80256ee600585943.nsf/(httpPages)/3ce7cfc0aa4a7548c12571c00039cb0c?OpenDocument&ExpandSection=1#_Section1 States parties and signatories]</ref> . 

The [[Goldstone Report]] wrote that the Mission was not in a position to state with certainty that DIME munitions were used by the Israeli armed forces, though it received reports from Palestinian and foreign doctors who had operated in Gaza during the military operations of a high percentage of patients with injuries compatible with their impact. The report added that as it currently stands, DIME weapons and weapons armed with heavy metal are not prohibited under international law, but do raise specific health concerns. <ref>[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/12session/A-HRC-12-48.pdf Goldstone report], Goldstone report, UNHRC, para. 49</ref>

===Human shields allegations===. 
On March 24, a report from the UN team responsible for the protection of children in war zones was released, it found "hundreds" of violations of the rights of children and accused Israeli soldiers of shooting children, using children as [[human shields]], bulldozing a home with a woman and child still inside, and shelling a building they had ordered civilians into a day earlier. <ref name="unchildren" /> One case involved using an 11-year-old boy as a human shield, by forcing him to enter suspected buildings first and also inspect bags.

The UK newspaper [[The Guardian]] conducted an investigation of its own which, according to the paper, uncovered evidence of war crimes including the use of Palestinian children as human shields and the targeting of medics and hospitals. The paper also found evidence of attacks on clearly distinguishable civilian targets. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/23/israel-gaza-war-crimes-guardian | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Guardian investigation uncovers evidence of alleged Israeli war crimes in Gaza | first=Clancy | last=Chassay | date=2009-03-24 | accessdate=2010-05-05}}</ref>   . 

In the report published by human rights NGO [[Breaking the Silence]] in July 2009, two testimonies were dedicated to alleged cases of using Palestinian civilians as human shields who were forced to enter suspect buildings ahead of troops. <ref name="Cast Lead Testimonies">[http://www.shovrimshtika.org/oferet/testimonies_e.asp?cat=2 Cast Lead Testimonies], Breaking the silence, July 15, 2009</ref> One of the testimonies were of the Golani Brigade soldier, who said that he had not seen Palestinians being used as human shields but had been told by his commanders that this occurred. <ref name="Barak: Criticism of IDF should be directed at me">[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1100300.html Barak: Criticism of IDF should be directed at me, Haaretz, July 15, 2009]</ref>  [[Golani Brigade]] commander Col.

[[Richard Falk]], the UN's Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in the Palestinian territories, alleged that Israel had confined Palestinian civilians to the combat zone in Gaza and prevented them from leaving during bombardment.

===Attacking and obstructing medical workers===. 
[[Amnesty International]] said in their report, published in July 2009, that lives were lost because Israeli forces "frequently obstructed access to medical care". Moreover, Amnesty accused Israel of using civilians, including children, as human shields in Gaza, forcing them to remain in houses which its troops were using as military positions, and to inspect sites suspected of being booby trapped. <ref name="Amnesty details Gaza 'war crimes'"/> Israeli military correspondent recorded evidence of a Palestinian family that had insisted on staying in the house occupied by IDF, but at the same time tried to accuse forces of abusing civilians. <ref name="A day with our troops in Gaza">[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3653238,00.html A day with our troops in Gaza] YNET, 09 January, 2009</ref>  . 

[[Physicians for Human Rights]]-Israel (PHR) stated the Israeli military violated medical ethics codes during its offensive, not only refusing to evacuate besieged and wounded families, but also preventing Palestinian medical teams from reaching the wounded. PHR quoted figures issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) which showed 16 Palestinian medical personnel were killed by Israeli fire during the offensive and that 25 were wounded while performing their duties. <ref name="israelmedical">{{cite news |title=Israeli troops broke medical ethics: rights group |first=Ori|last=Lewis|publisher=Reuters |date=2009-03-23 |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/newsMaps/idUSTRE52M0M020090323}}</ref> The IDF representative said in response that Hamas fighters had "methodically made use of medical vehicles, facilities and uniforms in order to conceal and camouflage terrorist activity, and in general used ambulances to carry terror activists and weapons."<ref name="israelmedical"/> An IDF investigation, published on April 22, 2009, stated that seven Palestinian medical personnel have been killed by the IDF, of which five were Hamas operatives (including a nephew of the Health Minister in Gaza) and two were civilians. <ref name="Haniyeh hid in hospital during Gaza op'">{{cite news|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1239710759267&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull|title='Haniyeh hid in hospital during Gaza op'|last=Katz|first=Yaakov|date=2009-04-22|publisher=JPost|accessdate=2009-04-22}}</ref> The Israeli Government report published in July 2009 further states that some of the reported cases of attacks on medical personnel were based on false information; in one such case the supposedly killed driver of the ambulance was allegedly interviewed on a Hamas website a few days after the incident. <ref name="FACTUAL AND LEGAL ASPECTS"/> . 

The PHR report further claimed that the Palestinian health system "collapsed" during the operation and failed to provide adequate medical care for the wounded. The WHO report, however, noted that there was no shortage in medicine or medical supplies and that hospitals were never more than 75% full. <ref name="Israel refutes claims of Gaza misconduct">[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1249418564462&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull Israel refutes claims of Gaza misconduct], JPost, Aug. 10, 2009</ref> . 

The PHR report accused the IDF of failing to assist in the evacuation of wounded Palestinians from the battlefield, claiming that the army had "created countless obstacles for the rescue teams in the field who attempted to evacuate trapped and injured persons." The Defense Ministry, however, said in its report that the Palestinian health authorities had refused to cooperate with the Gaza Coordination and Liaison Administration (CLA) to coordinate the transfer of wounded to Israel, despite "numerous requests by the CLA". <ref name="Israel refutes claims of Gaza misconduct"/> . 

===Attacks on UN facilities===. 
Ban Ki-Moon ordered a UN Headquarters Board of Inquiry led by [[Ian Martin]] to independently investigate the nine most serious attacks on UN personnel and property. Israeli Government report says that while Israel viewed this inquiry as premature, pending the conclusion of its internal investigations, it cooperated fully with the Board, providing it with pertinent information. <ref name="FACTUAL AND LEGAL ASPECTS"/> . 

Israel was faulted in seven of the nine cases, and Hamas was found guilty in one of the nine. The Israeli Government report notes however that the test applied by the Board was merely whether the physical premises of U.N. facilities had been affected and not whether the Laws of Armed Conflict were violated. <ref name="FACTUAL AND LEGAL ASPECTS"/> . 

One of those included [[Al-Fakhura school incident|an UNRWA school incident in Jabalia]] that the UN says killed between 30 and 40 people. IDF officials claim the UN has confirmed that shells fired by Israeli forces landed outside the school compound. <ref name="IDF Releases Information on Military Investigations"/> The report accused Israel of "gross negligence" and also stated that allegations that militants had fired from within U.N. premises "were untrue, continued to be made after it ought to have been known that they were untrue, and were not adequately withdrawn and publicly regretted." Ban plans to seek up to $11 million in damages from Israel<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/featuredCrisis/idUSN05321386 |publisher=Reuters |date=2009-05-05 |first=Patrick |last=Worsnip | title=UN report accuses Israel of recklessness in Gaza}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2009/sgsm12224.doc.htm |publisher=[[United Nations]] |date=2009-05-05}}</ref> . 

Israeli officials rejected the report as one-sided, saying it ignored the fact that Israel was fighting a war against a terrorist organization. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/featuredCrisis/idUSN05321386 | work=Reuters | title=UN report accuses Israel of recklessness in Gaza | first=Patrick | last=Worsnip | date=2009-05-05}}</ref> The IDF conducted its own probe into claims regarding incidents where UN and international facilities were fired upon and damaged.

===Military experts' opinions=== . 

A study by military analyst [[Anthony Cordesman|Anthony H. Cordesman]] of the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] concluded that Israel did not violate the laws of war during its operation in Gaza.

===Attacks directed against civilians and civilian objects===. 
[[Image:A rocket fired from a civilian area in Gaza towards civilian areas in Southern Israel.jpg|thumb|A rocket is fired from [[Gaza]] to [[Israel]] in December 2008]]
As stated by several sources, including the UN official and [[Human Rights Watch]] report published in August 2009, deliberate and systematic targeting of civilians and civilian objects in southern Israel since 2001 by Palestinian armed groups' rocket attacks violates [[International Humanitarian Law]] and amount to war crimes. <ref>{{cite web|author=AP, File |url=http://www.cleveland.com/world/index.ssf/2009/01/un_mulls_breach_in_civilian_le.html |title=UN rips breaches of civilian protections in Gaza |publisher=cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-27}}</ref><ref name="Rockets from Gaza - summary">[http://www.hrw.org/en/node/84867/section/2 Rockets from Gaza - summary], HRW, August 5, 2009</ref> Israeli [[Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center]] (ITIC) note that such attacks contravene the Principle of Distinction, as encapsulated by [[s:Protocol I#Art 48.

[[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) and [[B'Tselem]] reports notice that even if the above attacks were directed at a specific military objective, they would still be unlawful, due to the fact that the types of rockets used by Palestinian armed groups are imprecise and cannot be directed in a way that discriminates between military targets and civilians. <ref name="PalestinianRocket">{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/node/10911/section/3|title= Palestinian Rocket Attacks since the IDF Withdrawal}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.btselem.org/English/Israeli_Civilians/Qassam_Missiles.asp |title=B'Tselem - Attacks on Israeli Civilians by Palestinians - Rocket and mortar fire into Israel |publisher=Btselem.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-27}}</ref> . 

In 2007, exiled Hamas political chief [[Khaled Mashaal]] called recent rockets attacks on Israel "self-defense". <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,269091,00.html|title=Hamas: Rocket Attacks on Israel Are 'Self Defense'|agency=Associated Press|date=April 29, 2007 | work=Fox News}}</ref> Hamas leaders  argue that "rocket attacks on Israel are the only way to counter Israel's policies and operations, including artillery strikes". Nevertheless, [[Human Rights Watch]] has said that such justifications do not overcome the illegality of the attacks under laws governing reprisals, which prohibit direct or indiscriminate attacks on civilians. <ref name="hrw_palrockets">[http://www.hrw.org/en/node/10911/section/3 Palestinian Rocket Attacks since the IDF Withdrawal] HRW, August 2009</ref> In its August 2009 report, HRW notes that the absence of Israeli military forces in the areas struck by the rockets, as well as statements from the leaders of Hamas and other armed groups, indicate that many of these attacks are deliberately intended to strike Israeli civilians and civilian structures; individuals who willfully authorize or carry out deliberate or indiscriminate attacks against civilians are committing war crimes. <ref name="Rockets from Gaza - summary"/>  . 

The Amnesty report, published in July 2009, said Palestinian militants rocket fire from the Gaza Strip was "indiscriminate and hence unlawful under international law", regardless of small number of civilian casualties. <ref name="Amnesty details Gaza 'war crimes'"/> Hamas official rejected the report as "unbalanced, unfair and unprofessional," calling the firing of rockets "self defense" and a legitimate response to Israel's actions. <ref name="Hamas, Israel reject Amnesty claims" /> . 

HRW report, published in August 2009, says that the rocket attacks have also placed civilians in Gaza at risk, killing several local residents; furthermore, Palestinian armed groups have frequently violated the laws of war by firing rockets from within populated areas, failing to take all feasible precautions to avoid placing military targets within densely populated areas. <ref name="Rockets from Gaza - summary"/> In a response to HRW report, Hamas spokesman denied the charges, saying that "Hamas did not fire rockets from residential areas, Hamas does not target civilians". <ref name="Rights Group: Hamas May Have Committed War Crimes">[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2009/08/06/world/AP-ML-Palestinians-War-Crimes.html?_r=3&pagewanted=all Rights Group: Hamas May Have Committed War Crimes], NY Times, August 6, 2009</ref> Addressing the allegations in the UN Fact-Finding Mission's report, a spokesman for Hamas in Gaza further added that the rockets fired at Israel were in self-defense and were not intended to target civilians: "We were targeting military bases, but the primitive weapons make mistakes". <ref name="Inquiry Finds Gaza War Crimes From Both Sides">[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/16/world/middleeast/16gaza.html?hpw Inquiry Finds Gaza War Crimes From Both Sides], NY Times, September 15, 2009</ref> . 

===Attacks aimed to spread terror===. 
HRW points out that primary purpose of the rocket attacks seems to be at least to spread terror among the Israeli civilian population. HRW adds that the rockets have created a pervasive climate of fear among people in the areas where they can reach. <ref name="PalestinianRocket" /> During the fighting, the psychological effect of the rocket strikes paralyzed life across Israel's south. <ref name="ap-msnbc-psych-war">{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28608585/|title=Israel's Gaza war adds psychological operations|date=2009-01-11|publisher=Associated Press via [[MSNBC]]|accessdate=2009-02-19}}</ref>  HRW official stated that "firing rockets into civilian areas with the intent to harm and terrorize Israelis has no justification whatsoever, regardless of Israel's actions in Gaza". <ref name="Civilians must not be targets">{{cite web| url=http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/12/30/israelgaza-civilians-must-not-be-targets |title= Civilians must not be targets}}</ref> Military expert, who testified in front of the fact-finding UNHCR mission in July 2009, said that rockets launched from Gaza Strip belong to Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) type of weapon that incorporate “destructive, lethal, noxious, pyrotechnic materials” that are used in 70% of global terror attacks. He further noticed that the level of lethal damage of IEDs is low compared to other means and that their primary impact on the target is psychological. <ref name="Public hearings – Geneva, Afternoon Session of 7 July 2009"/> ITIC asserted that the attacks aimed at sowing terror among Israel's civilian population are prohibited under [[International Humanitarian Law]] and violate [[s:Protocol I#Art 51. - Protection of the civilian population|Article 51(2)]] of [[Protocol I|Additional Protocol I]] to the [[Geneva Conventions]]: "Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited."<ref name="Hamas Exploitation of Civilians as Human Shields"/> . 

===Attacks from populated areas===. 
The BBC reported on January 5 that "Witnesses and analysts confirm that [[Hamas]] fires rockets from within populated civilian areas. <ref name=bbc2009jan5 /> [[Amnesty International]] assessed that Hamas fighters put civilians in danger by firing from homes. <ref name="Gaza 'human shields' criticized">{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7818122.stm |title= Gaza 'human shields' criticized| publisher=BBC| date=April January 8, 2009}}</ref> United Nations Humanitarian Affairs Chief John Holmes accused Hamas of "reckless and cynical" use of civilian facilities during the hostilities in the Gaza Strip, and told that the above, as well as indiscriminate firing of rockets against civilian populations, are clear violations of [[International Humanitarian Law]]. <ref name="Top UN official blasts Hamas for 'cynical' use of civilian facilities">

A study by [[Center for Strategic and International Studies|CSIS]] suggests that Hamas must share responsibility for the outcome on the civil population, as it seems to have relied on the population density of Gaza to both deter Israeli attacks, and as a defense against Israeli offensive. <ref name="AnthonyHCordesman"/> [[Irwin Cotler]] said that attacks from within civilian areas and civilian structures in order to be immune from a response, e.g. apartment building, a mosque or a hospital, are unlawful; he argues that in these cases Hamas bears legal responsibility for the harm to civilians, as enshrined in general principles of [[International Humanitarian Law]]. <ref name="Law professor: Hamas is a war crimes 'case study'"/> ITIC accused Hamas of making systematic use of protected civilian areas (including homes and mosques) for the hiding and storage of rockets, explosives and ammunition; using of civilian facilities (such as universities) for weapons development; calling on Palestinians to flock to targets which are expected to be attacked in order to form "human shields". ITIC states that such conduct contravenes the [[Laws of Armed Conflict]] and some of the practices above, e.g. [[s:Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court#Article 8 - War crimes|Art. 8(2)(b)(xxiii)]] of the [[International Criminal Court]], amount to a war crime. <ref name="Hamas Exploitation of Civilians as Human Shields"/> . 

The Amnesty report, issued in July 2009, found no evidence that Palestinian militants had forced civilians to stay in buildings being used for military purposes, contradicting Israeli claims that Hamas repeatedly used "human shields"; however, Amnesty assumed that Palestinian militant groups had endangered civilians by firing rockets from residential neighbourhoods and storing weapons in them. <ref name="Amnesty details Gaza 'war crimes'"/> [[Human Rights Watch]] researchers said that they did not find instances in which Palestinian fighters had fired from within the midst of the civilian population; however, they pointed out that the International Crisis Group interviewed three Hamas fighters in January who said, "They had often fired rockets in close proximity to homes and from alleys, hoping that nearby civilians would deter Israel from responding."<ref name="HRW: Hamas rocket attacks 'war crime'">[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1249418537852&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull HRW: Hamas rocket attacks 'war crime'], JPost, August 6, 2009</ref> In the 2009 annual world report, HRW noted that Hamas had used human shields during the war.

Additionally, reports by news media and a nongovernmental organization indicate that in some cases, Palestinian armed groups intentionally hid behind civilians to unlawfully use them as shields to deter Israeli counter-attacks."</blockquote> .

==Proposal to change International Law==. 
Prime Minister of Israel [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] suggested there were problems with International Law and changes needed to be made in the light of the [[United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict|Goldstone Report]]. <ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/wires/2009/10/21/israel-push-to-change-law_ws_328024.html "Israel Pushes To Change International Laws Of War After Damning Gaza Report"] Huffington Post, 21st October 2009. </ref> On 21 October 2009 he directed relevant ministries to look into it. <ref>[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1256037270297&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull "PM: Change the laws of war to deal with terrorism"] Jerusalem Post 23rd October 2009. </ref> [[Javier Solana]], head of the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy, expressed understanding of the call to change the laws governing warfare, saying that "in yesterday's world there were wars of armies against armies and there were laws and conventions that dealt with the conduct of such wars. It is necessary to invest thought to the changing situation in which there is asymmetry between fighting parties, a situation in which it is difficult to implement the classic/old rules of war." At the same time he stressed that "until new rules are in place we must obey the old ones". <ref name="Solana to Haaretz: New rules of war needed for age of terror">http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1123034.html Solana to Haaretz: New rules of war needed for age of terror, Haaretz, October 23, 2009</ref>  . 

Professor of International Law [[William Schabas]] chair of the International Institute for Criminal Investigation law told Israeli Army Radio he thought "the fact that Netanyahu says he wants to change the laws of war is almost an admission that Israel violated them".
