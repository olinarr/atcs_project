'''International reaction to the Gaza War''' came from many countries and international organisations. International reaction to the conflict was also notable in the level of civilian [[demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] all around the world, which in many cases displayed sentiment significantly different from the official government line. <ref>{{cite news|author=Published: 11:14PM GMT 29 Dec 2008 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/4016850/Gaza-attacks-Israeli-strikes-spark-protests-across-world.html |title=Gaza attacks: Israeli strikes spark protests across world |work=The Telegraph |date=2008-12-29 |accessdate=2009-09-19|location=London}}</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7802078.stm BBC NEWS|UK|London protest over raids on Gaza].

==Long term effects and reaction==. 
In the aftermath of the crisis, observers suggested Israel's diplomatic position and foreign reputation had been permanently tainted. The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported in March that [[Israel]] was "facing its worst diplomatic crisis in two decades."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/19/world/middleeast/19israel.html?_r=2&hp|title=Israel grapples with diplomatic deterioration]</ref> Other effects on Israel included: Its sports teams met hostility and violent protests in Sweden, Spain and Turkey. Mauritania closed Israel's embassy. Relations with Turkey, an important Muslim ally, deteriorated severely. A group of top international judges and human rights investigators called for an inquiry into Israel's actions in Gaza. "Israel Apartheid Week" drew participants in 54 cities around the world in March 2009, twice the number of last year, according to its organisers. "And even in the American Jewish community...there is a chill."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/19/world/middleeast/19israel.html?_r=2&hp ''New York Times'']</ref> .

|{{flag|Slovenia}}|| Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a press release saying "The Ministry is closely following the current situation in Gaza and south Israel, and expresses concern regarding the increased violence that has been claiming more and more civilian victims. The Ministry condemns Hamas's interruption of the cease fire that had been in place and the constant rocket attacks on Israeli territories, while at the same time opposing the disproportionate use of force on the part of the Israeli army and clear violations of international humanitarian law. The Ministry condemns in particular the Israeli army attacks on schools, health centres and UNRWA buildings. There is no excuse for today's attack on a UNRWA building that killed 40 people, which represents an egregious violation of international humanitarian law. The Ministry therefore calls on Hamas to cease all rocket attacks on Israel immediately and on Israel to stop its military action. The Ministry also advocates the unhindered opening of all border crossings with Gaza in order to ensure the supply of humanitarian aid and fuel, and the presence of medical staff. Moreover, conditions must be created for the safe distribution of aid to the civilian population. The Ministry is already examining possibilities of immediate help to alleviate the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. Greater engagement of the EU and its international partners is of crucial importance in achieving sustainable peace. To this end, an EU delegation is paying an important visit to the region, and Egypt, the Arab League and Turkey continue to strive for termination of the violence and resumption of negotiations."<ref>[http://www.mzz.gov.si/nc/en/tools/news/cns/news/article/6/25069/?cHash=000df7bb0d Ministry press release on the current situation in Gaza]{{dead link|date=September 2009}}</ref>

===Theatre plays===.

Churchill has said that anyone wishing to produce it may do so ''gratis'', so long as they hold a collection for the people of [[Gaza]] at the end. consists of seven scenes spread over roughly seventy years, in which Jewish adults discuss what, or whether, their children should be told about certain events in recent Jewish history that the play alludes to only indirectly.
