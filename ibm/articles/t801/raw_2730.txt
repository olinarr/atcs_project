'''Operation Hot Winter''', also called '''Operation Warm Winter''' ({{lang-he|מבצע חורף חם}}, ''Mivtza Horef Ham'') was an [[Israel Defense Forces]] military campaign in the [[Gaza Strip]], launched on February 29, 2008 in response to [[Qassam rocket]]s fired from the Strip by [[Hamas]]. At least 112 [[Palestinian militants]] and civilians, along with three [[Israel]]is, were killed, and more than 150 Palestinians and seven Israelis were injured. <ref name="bbc article 2" /> . 

There was widespread international alarm at the scale of the operation, with the [[United States Department of State]] encouraging Israel to exercise caution to avoid the loss of innocent life, and the [[United Nations]] criticising Israel's ''"disproportionate use of force"''. The [[European Union]] demanded an immediate end to [[Palestinian militant]] [[Rocket and mortar attacks on southern Israel|rocket attacks on Israel]] and also criticised what they called Israel's ''"disproportionate use of force."''<ref name="bbc article 2" /><ref name="haaretz 3">{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/959837.html|title=U.S. calls for end to continued violence, return to peace talks|author= Shamir, Shlomo|date=2008-03-02|publisher=[[Haaretz]]}}</ref> . 

==Background==. 
After the [[Breach of the Gaza-Egypt border (2008)|Gaza-Egypt border breach]] by Hamas during an Israeli blockade of Gaza, [[Shin Bet]] officials concluded the Palestinian militant groups had smuggled large numbers of longer-ranged missiles, such as [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyushas]] and [[BM-21|Grads]] into the strip that were capable of reaching [[Ashkelon]], a city six times as large as the rocket-battered town of [[Sderot]].  . 

On February 27, 2008, Hamas, the [[Popular Resistance Committees]] and the [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]] fired a rocket barrage, in which they fired for the first time six Grad missiles at the industrial city of Ashkelon. While only a few people were lightly injured, the attack had a profound psychological impact. The Israeli Prime Minister and several other minister vowed a tough response. The next day, the IDF started an operation to halt, or at least decrease the rocket fire.  . 

==Operation== . 

According to the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF), the operation was aimed at disrupting terrorist infrastructure in the Gaza Strip. One of the targets was Hamas prime minister [[Ismail Haniyeh]]'s office. <ref name="haniyeh article">{{Cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3513481,00.html|publisher=[[Ynetnews]]|title=IAF strikes Haniyeh's office|date=2008-03-02|accessdate=2008-03-02|author=Waked, Ali}}</ref><ref name="bbc article">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7272329.stm|title=Dozens die in Israel-Gaza clashes|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-03-02|accessdate=2008-03-02}}</ref> . 

Troops from the [[Givati Brigade]], [[Israeli Engineering Corps|Combat Engineering forces]] and the [[Armor Corps (Israel)|Armor Corps]] are also known to have been involved in the ground operation. The [[Israeli Air Force]] was also involved, carrying out airstrikes and providing tactical support for the ground troops. A source in the IDF said that the cooperation between ground and air forces was satisfactory. <ref name="initial article" /> . 

From February 29 to March 1, Israel mostly carried out airstrikes at ammo warehouses, rocket factories, rocket warehouses and launching cells, combined with small incursions close to the border. Despite the IAF presence in the whole Gaza Strip and the IDF presence in  the border areas, the Palestinian militants managed to fire more than 200 rockets during the operation, most of them at Sderot, but at least 20 at Ashkelon and 1 at Netivot. 
After a day in which 50 rockets were fired, IDF decided to change its strategy on March 2 and sent a whole regiment (about 2000 men) into the Northern Strip to occupy [[Jabalya]] and [[Sajiyah]] but met stiff resistance from the Palestinians. In the bloodiest day for Gaza since 2002, close to 70 civilians were killed. Military deaths totalled 4 Palestinian fighters<ref>[[Al Jazeera English]]: Palestinians killed in Gaza Raids</ref> and 2 Israeli soldiers.  . 

On March 3, 2008 Israel, according to the IDF, was free to search for factories, terrorist infrastructure, Qassam warehouses and rocket launchers in the 2 towns. In the evening, Israel pulled out its troops from the Gaza Strip, but [[Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Ehud Olmert]] said the operation ended but Israel would soon return to counter the rocket firing and said the airstrikes "would continue". <ref name="bbc article 2" /> .

While expressing regret for civilian casualties, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak blamed "Hamas and those firing rockets at Israel," his office said in a statement, pledging to continue the offensive to protect Israeli towns and cities. The Israeli army said it was targeting rocket squads, and blamed militants for operating in populated areas. [[Associated Press]] photos showed rockets being launched from densely populated areas in northern Gaza. <ref name=bernstein/> On 5 March 2008, Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]]'s office announced that Israel would maintain its pressure on Hamas. Olmert did leave the door open to an unofficial truce with Hamas. "If there is no rocket fire at Israel, there won't be Israeli attacks on Gaza," he told reporters. Israeli government spokesman David Baker said Israel was "compelled to continue to take these defensive measures" to protect more than 200,000 Israelis living under the threat of Palestinian rocket barrages.Militants "hide behind their own civilians, using them as human shields, while actively targeting Israeli population centers," Baker said. "They bear the responsibility for the results." Israeli military spokeswoman Maj. Avital Leibovich called Saturday's action a "pinpoint operation" provoked by the rocket attack on Ashkelon earlier in the week. She blamed the high civilian toll on Hamas' practice of using homes to store and produce projectiles. "We are not targeting homes and we have no intentions of targeting uninvolved civilians," she said. "We will target launchers and Hamas militants, and bunkers." In Washington, [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] spokesman [[Gordon Johndroe]] expressed regret for loss of civilian life on both sides but put most of the blame on the Palestinians. "There is a clear distinction between terrorist rocket attacks that target civilians and action in self-defense," he said in a statement. <ref name=usatoday>{{Cite news

*[[Al-Qaeda]] - [[Osama bin Laden]] called for a holy war on behalf of the Palestinians and warned of a "severe" reaction against Europe over the republishing of newspaper cartoons seen as insulting Islam's Prophet Muhammad. [[Ayman al-Zawahri]] released a tape calling on Muslims to "strike the interests of the Jews, the Americans, and all those who participated in the attack on Muslims", and not to limit attacks in Israel, but "everywhere". Al-Zawahri also denounced Arab leaders he accused of supporting Israel — pointing to Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, suggesting they too could be targets. <ref name=keath/> . 

==="Shoah" controversy===. 
On 29 February, Israel's Deputy Defense Minister, [[Matan Vilnai]], said . 

<blockquote>"As the rocket fire grows, and the range increases... they [Palestinians] are bringing upon themselves a greater 'Shoah' because we will use all our strength in every way we deem appropriate..."</blockquote> . 

The term "[[Shoah (disambiguation)|shoah]]" in [[Hebrew]] means "disaster"; but Ha-Shoah (The Holocaust) is primarily used in Israel to refer to the [[Holocaust]], and is rarely used outside that context. As a result the wire service put out a story "Israel minister warns Palestinians of 'Holocaust'", provoking a controversy. <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2008/February/middleeast_February359.xml&section=middleeast|title=Israel minister warns Palestinians of “shoah”|author= Reuters|date=2008-02-29|accessdate=2008-03-03|publisher=[[Khaleej Times]]}}</ref><ref name = Shoah>{{Cite news|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1204214002068&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|title='Shoah' remark sparks uproar|author= Lefkovits, Etgar|date=2008-03-02|accessdate=2008-03-02|publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}</ref><ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7270650.stm Israel warns of invasion of Gaza]," [[BBC News]] 29 February 2008. </ref> Vilnai's spokesman later insisted that he meant only meant "disaster, ruin or destruction" and not "genocide". <ref name = Shoah/> .
