{{For|the English musician|Only Child (musician)}}
An '''only child''' is a person with no [[sibling]]s, either [[biological]] or [[adoption|adopted]]. In a family with multiple offspring, first-borns, may be briefly considered only children and have a similar early [[family]] environment, but the term ''only child'' is generally applied only to those individuals who never have siblings. An only child, however, may have half-siblings or step-siblings who come along considerably late (after they reach their teens) and still be considered an only child. Children with much older siblings (generally ten or more years) may also have a similar family environment to only children.  . 

== Overview == . 

Throughout history, only children were relatively uncommon. Faced with declining [[birth rates]], [[birth control]], inflation, and a larger demand for the workforce, more families began to raise only children. In recent years, the number of families in the [[United States]], [[Europe]], and [[Japan]] choosing to have one child has increased considerably since the 1940s, coinciding with [[women's liberation|achieving equality in the workforce]]. <ref>[http://onlychild.com/about_us.htm "The Purpose of Only Child"].

Families may have an only child for a variety of reasons, including: personal preference, [[family planning]], financial and emotional or physical health issues, desire to travel, stress in the family, educational advantages, late marriage, stability, focus, time constraints, fears over pregnancy, advanced age, [[infertility]],  [[divorce]], and death of a sibling or parent.  . 

== Stereotypes ==. 
Only children are often subject to a stereotype that equates them with [[spoiled brat]]s in Western countries. [[G. Stanley Hall]] was one of the first experts to give only children a bad reputation when he referred to their situation as "a disease in itself." Even today, only children are commonly stereotyped as "spoiled, selfish, and bratty."<ref name="ABC News">[http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=3488411&page=1 The Only Child Myth], By Juju Chang and Sara Holmberg, ABC News, Retrieved on August 25th, 2008. </ref> While only children receive unlimited time for development and resources, there's no confirmation they are overindulged or considerably differ from children with siblings. <ref>[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2002382,00.html "The Only Child: Debunking the Myths"]. ''Time''. July 8, 2010. Retrieved July 9, 2010. </ref> Susan Newman, a social psychologist at [[Rutgers University]] and the author of ''Parenting an Only Child'', says that this is a myth. "People articulate that only children are spoiled, they're aggressive, they're bossy, they're lonely, they're maladjusted," she said. "There have been hundreds and hundreds of research studies that show that only children are no different from their peers."<ref name="ABC News"/> Similarly, a popular belief is held that only children have aversive social skills, and therefore a harder time making friends. Based on a 2004 study of American middle and high school students, such beliefs were confirmed false. <ref>[http://www.babble.com/kid/child-development/one-child-okay-only-child-syndrome/ "Only Children Turn Out Just Fine"].

In China, perceived behavioral problems in single children may be disparagingly called [[Little Emperor Syndrome]]<ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/2001/04/22/the-rise-of-the-only-child.html# "The Rise Of The Only Child"]. ''Newsweek''. April 23, 2001. Retrieved December 25, 2010. </ref> and the lack of siblings has been blamed for a number of social ills such as materialism and crime. However, recent studies do not support these claims, and show no significant differences in personality between singletons and children in larger families.  <ref>Wan, et al. "Comparison of personality traits of only and sibling school children in Beijing." Journal of Genetic Psychology 155.4: 377(12). </ref>  The one child policy has also been speculated to be the underlying cause of forced [[abortions]], [[female infanticide]], underreporting<ref name="abortions">For studies that reported underreporting or delayed reporting of female births, see the following:

Popular media often posits that it is more difficult for only children to cooperate in a conventional family environment, as they have no competitors for their parents and family. It is suggested that confusion arises about the norms of ages and roles and that a similar effect exists in understanding during relationships with other peers and youth, all throughout life. <ref>[http://www.parents.com/parenting/better-parenting/style/10-tips-for-parenting-only-children/ "10 Tips for Parenting Only Children"].

== Scientific research ==. 
A 1987 [[meta-analysis|quantitative review]] of 141 studies on 16 different personality traits contradicts the opinion, held by theorists including [[Alfred Adler]], that only children feel maladjusted due to pampering. <ref>Adler, A. (1964). ''Problems of neurosis''. New York: Harper and Row. </ref> The study found no evidence of any maladjustment in only children. The most important finding was that only children are not very different from children with siblings.  The main exception to this was the finding that only children are higher in achievement motivation, largely because their greater share of parental attention translates into increased parental scrutiny:  This scrutiny, especially as compounded by only children's access to a greater share of parental resources, exposes them to greater absolute quantities of both reward when they exceed parental expectations and punishment when they fall short. <ref>{{Citation |last=Polit |first=D. F. |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Falbo |first2=T. |year=1987 |title=Only children and personality development: A quantitative review |journal=Journal of Marriage and the Family |volume=49 |issue= |pages=309–325 |doi=10.2307/352302 }}. </ref> A second analysis revealed that only children, first-borns, and children with only one sibling score higher on tests of verbal ability than later-borns and children with multiple siblings. <ref>{{Citation |last=Polit |first=D.

The advantage of only children in test scores and achievement motivation may be due to the greater amount of parental attention they receive. According to the Resource Dilution Model, parental resources (e.g. time to read to the child) are important in development. Because these resources are finite, children with many siblings receive fewer resources. <ref>{{Citation |last=Downey |first=D. B. |year=2001 |title=Number of siblings and intellectual development: The resource dilution explanation |journal=American Psychologist |volume=56 |issue= |pages=497–504 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.56.6-7.497 }}. </ref> . 

In his book ''Maybe One'', [[Bill McKibben]] argues in favor of a one child policy based on this research. He argues that most cultural stereotypes are false, that there are not many differences between only children and other children, and where there are differences, they are favorable to the only child. Aside from scoring significantly better in achievement motivation, only children score significantly better in personal adjustment to new situations. Only children are also more likely to make outside friends, whereas children with siblings tend to be "more parochial and limited in their understanding of a variety of social roles",<ref>{{Citation |last=McKibben |first=B. |year=1998 |title=Maybe one: A personal and environmental argument for single-child families |location=New York |publisher=Simon & Schuster |page=37 |isbn=0684852810 }}. </ref> but it is usually more difficult for them to do so, even in early life. <ref>[http://www.mirror.co.uk/advice/miriam/2010/11/30/so-is-an-only-child-really-happier-115875-22751236/ "So is an only child really happier?"].

Most research on only children has been [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] and focused on the behaviour of only-children and on how others, for example teachers, assess that behaviour. [[Bernice Sorensen]], in contrast, used [[qualitative methods]] in order to elicit meaning and to discover what only-children themselves understand, feel or sense about their lives that are lived without siblings. Her research showed that during their life span only children often become more aware of their only child status and are very much affected by society's stereotype of the only-child whether or not the stereotype is true or false. She argues in her book, ''Only Child Experience and Adulthood'', that growing up in a predominantly sibling society affects only children and that their lack of sibling relationships can have an important effect on both the way they see themselves and others and how they interact with the world. <ref>{{Citation |last=Sorensen |first=B. |year=2008 |title=Only Child Experience and Adulthood |location=Hampshire |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |pages=164–195 |isbn=0230521010 }}. </ref> . 

=== The Big Five ===. 
Many contemporary personality theorists believe that the "[[big five personality traits]]" (also known as Five Factor Model) represent a natural taxonomy of human personality variables. Across different languages, the vast majority of adjectives used to describe human personality fit into one of the following five areas, easily remembered by the acronym OCEAN: [[Openness to experience|Openness]], [[Conscientiousness]], [[Extraversion]], [[Agreeableness]], and [[Neuroticism]]. Factor analyses of [[personality test]]s also tend to cluster around these five factors.  . 

In his book ''Born to Rebel'', [[Frank Sulloway]] provides evidence that [[birth order]] influences the development of Big Five personality traits. Sulloway suggests that firstborns and only children are more conscientious, more socially dominant, less agreeable, and less open to new ideas compared to laterborns. <ref>{{Citation |last=Sulloway |first=F. J. |year=1996 |title=Born to rebel: Birth order, family dynamics and creative lives |location=New York |publisher=Pantheon Books |isbn=0679442324 }}. </ref> However, his conclusions have been challenged by other researchers,<ref>{{Citation |last=Harris |first=J. R. |year=2006 |title=No two alike: Human nature and human individuality |location=New York |publisher=WW Norton & Company |isbn=0393059480 }}. </ref> who argue that birth order effects are weak and inconsistent. In one of the largest studies conducted on the effect of birth order on the Big Five, data from a national sample of 9,664 subjects found no association between birth order and scores on the [[NEO PI-R]] personality test. <ref>{{Citation |last=Jefferson |first=T. |last2=Herbst |first2=J.
