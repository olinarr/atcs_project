'''Two-child policy''' is a government-imposed limit of two [[children]] allowed per [[family]]. It is used for some population groups in China, has previously been used in [[Vietnam]], and has lately been discussed in the [[Philippines]]. Although not by law, citizens of [[Hong Kong]] are also highly encouraged to have two children as a limit, and it is used as part of the region's [[family planning]] strategies.{{Out of date|article|Hong Kong is unlikely to still have this suggested limit, given its extremely low fertility rate of 0.9|date=November 2010}} . 

== China ==. 
During the 1970s, Chinese citizens were encouraged to have two children. The ongoing [[Cultural Revolution]] and the strain it placed on the nation were large factors. During this time, the birth rate dropped from nearly 6 children per woman to just under 3. <ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html#People CIA World Factbook]</ref> (The colloquial term "births per woman" is usually formalized as the ''[[Total Fertility Rate]]'' (TFR), a technical term in demographic analysis meaning the average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime if she were to experience the exact current age-specific fertility rates through her lifetime.) . 

As China's youngest generation (born under the [[one-child policy]], which first became a requirement for most couples in 1979) is now of age for formation of the next generation, a single child would be left with having to provide support for his or her two parents and four grandparents. In response to this issue, certain provinces maintained that couples were allowed to have two children if both parents were only children themselves. As of 2009, all provinces in the nation adopted this new adaptation. <ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2007-07-10/154513416121.shtml | language=Chinese | accessdate=7 November 2008 | date=10 July 2007 | publisher=[[Sina.com]] | title=计生委新闻发言人:11%以上人口可生两个孩子 (English: "Spokesperson of the one-child policy committee: 11% or more of the population may have two children)}}</ref> . 

Moreover, in accordance with PRC's [[affirmative action]] policies towards [[List of Chinese ethnic groups|ethnic minorities]], all non-[[Han Chinese|Han]] ethnic groups are subjected to different rules and are usually allowed to have two children in urban areas, and three or four in rural areas. Han Chinese living in rural areas are often permitted to have two children, as exceptions exist if the first child is a daughter. <ref name="yardley">{{cite web | last=Yardley | first=Jim | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=11 May 2008 | accessdate=20 November 2008 | title=China Sticking With One-Child Policy | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/11/world/asia/11china.html?_r=2}}</ref> Because of cases such as these, as well as urban couples who simply pay a fine (or "social maintenance fee") to have more children,<ref>"[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-12/14/content_3918776.htm New rich challenge family planning policy]."

[[File:FPAHK Poster1.jpg|thumb|In Hong Kong, the ''Two is Enough'' campaign in 1970s encouraged people to have 2 or fewer children in each family. It contributed to the reduced [[birth rate]] in the following decades.]]

In Hong Kong, the Eugenics League was found in 1936, which became [[The Family Planning Association of Hong Kong]] in 1950. <ref name="famplan.org.hk">[http://www.famplan.org.hk/fpahk/en/template1.asp?style=template1.asp&content=about/history.asp History of the Family Planning Association of Hong Kong]</ref> The organisation provides family planning advice, [[sex education]], [[birth control]] services to the general public of [[Hong Kong]]. In the 1970s, due to the rapidly rising population, it launched the "Two is Enough" campaign,<ref name="famplan.org.hk"/> which reduced the general birth rate through educational means. The organisation,<ref name="ippf.org">[http://www.ippf.org/en/About/History.htm History of International Planned Parenthood Federation]</ref>  founded the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] with its counterparts in seven other countries. <ref name="ippf.org"/>
The Total Fertility rate in Hong Kong is 1.04 births per Woman.  . 

==Vietnam==. 
Vietnam had a two-child policy in the 1960s, which was used again in the 1990s. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1011799.stm "Vietnam's two-child policy"]. ''BBC''. November 8, 2000. Retrieved April 23, 2010. </ref> The movement has been proven to lower Vietnam's [[birth rate]], which had previously been at nearly 4 children per woman. In 2003, the plan was discontinued. In 2008, it was announced that the government was considering reviving it. <ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/21/vietnam-population-baby-boom "Vietnam plans return to two-child policy to tackle population growth"].
