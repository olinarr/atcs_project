'''Human population control''' is the practice of artificially altering the rate of growth of a human population. Historically, human population control has been implemented by limiting the population's [[birth rate]], usually by government mandate, and has been undertaken as a response to factors including high or increasing levels of [[poverty]], [[carrying capacity|environmental concerns]], [[religion|religious reasons]], and [[overpopulation]]. While population control can involve measures that improve people's lives by giving them greater control of their reproduction, some programs have exposed them to exploitation. <ref>[http://www.populationconcern.org.uk/free_downloads.asp Populationconcern.org.uk]</ref> . 

Worldwide, the population control movement was active throughout the 1960s and 1970s, driving many [[reproductive health]] and [[family planning]] programs. In the 1980s, tension grew between population control advocates and women's health activists who advanced women's [[reproductive rights]] as part of a [[human rights]]-based approach. <ref>{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=0826515282, 9780826515285 |pages=2 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=b3thCcdyScsC&dq=reproductive+rights&cad=0 }}</ref> Growing opposition to the narrow population control focus led to a significant change in population control policies in the early 1990s. <ref>{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=0826515282, 9780826515285 |pages=4–5 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=b3thCcdyScsC&dq=reproductive+rights&cad=0 }}</ref> . 

==Methods==. 
Population control may use one or more of the following practices although there are other methods as well: . 

* [[birth control|contraception]]
* [[sexual abstinence|abstinence]]
* [[abortion]]
* [[infanticide]]
* [[emigration]]
* [[immigration reduction|decreasing immigration]]
* [[Sterilisation (medicine)|sterilization]]
* [[euthanasia]]
* [[genocide]] . 

The method(s) chosen can be strongly influenced by the [[Religion|religious]] and cultural beliefs of community members. The failure of other methods of population control can lead to the use of abortion or infanticide as solutions{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}. While a specific population control practice may be legal/mandated in one country, it may be illegal or restricted in another, indicative of the controversy surrounding this topic.  . 

==History==. 
===Ancient times through Middle Ages===. 
A number of ancient writers have reflected on the issue of population. At about 300 BCE in India, [[Kautilya]], a [[political philosopher]] (c. 350-283 BCE), considered population as a source of political, economic, and military strength. Though a given region can house too many or too few people, he considered the latter possibility to be the greater evil. Kautilya favored the remarriage of [[widows]] (which at the time was forbidden in India), opposed taxes that encourage emigration, and believed that [[asceticism]] should be restricted to the aged. <ref name="Neurath 1994 7">{{cite book |title=From Malthus to the Club of Rome and Back |last= Neurath |first=Paul |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1994 |publisher= M.E. Sharpe|location= |isbn=1563244071, 9781563244070 |pages=7 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_ZHx3GO_xLMC&dq=%22population+control%22}}</ref> . 

In [[ancient Greece]], [[Plato]] (427-347 BCE) and [[Aristotle]] (384-322 BCE) discussed the best population size for Greek [[city states]] such as Sparta, and concluded that cities should be small enough for efficient administration and direct citizen participation in public affairs, but at the same time needed to be large enough to defend themselves against hostile neighboring city states. In order to maintain a desired population size, the philosophers advised that [[procreation]], and if necessary, [[immigration]], should be encouraged if the population size was too small. [[Emigration]] to colonies would be encouraged should the population become too large. <ref name="Neurath 1994 6"/> Aristotle concluded that a large increase in population would bring, "certain poverty on the citizenry, and poverty is the cause of sedition and evil." To halt rapid population increase, Aristotle advocated the use of [[abortion]] and the exposure of newborns. <ref>{{cite book |title=From Malthus to the Club of Rome and Back |last= Neurath |first=Paul |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1994 |publisher= M.E. Sharpe|location= |isbn=1563244071, 9781563244070 |pages=6–7 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_ZHx3GO_xLMC&dq=%22population+control%22}}</ref> . 

[[Confucius]] (551-478 BCE) and other Chinese writers cautioned that, "excessive growth may reduce output per worker, repress levels of living for the masses and engender strife." Confucius also observed that, "mortality increases when food supply is insufficient; that permanent marriage makes for high infantile mortality rates, that war checks population growth."<ref name="Neurath 1994 6">{{cite book |title=From Malthus to the Club of Rome and Back |last= Neurath |first=Paul |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1994 |publisher= M.E. Sharpe|location= |isbn=1563244071, 9781563244070 |pages=6 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_ZHx3GO_xLMC&dq=%22population+control%22}}</ref> . 

[[Ancient Rome]], especially in the time of [[Augustus]] (63 BCE- CE 14), needed manpower to acquire and administer the vast [[Roman Empire]]. A series of laws were instituted to encourage early marriage and frequent childbirth. Lex Julia (18 BCE) and the Lex Papia Poppaea (CE 9) are two well known examples of such laws, which among others, provided tax breaks and preferential treatment when applying for public office for those that complied with the laws. Severe limitations were imposed on those who did not. For example, the surviving spouse of a childless couple could only inherit one-tenth of the deceased fortune, while the rest was taken by the state. These laws encountered resistance from the population which led to the disregard of their provisions and to their eventual abolition. <ref name="Neurath 1994 7"/> . 

[[Tertullian]], an early Christian author (ca. CE 160-220), was one of the first to describe famine and war as factors that can prevent overpopulation. <ref name="Neurath 1994 7"/> He wrote: "The strongest witness is the vast population of the earth to which we are a burden and she scarcely can provide for our needs; as our demands grow greater, our complaints against Nature's inadequacy are heard by all. The scourges of pestilence, famine, wars and earthquakes have come to be regarded as a blessing to overcrowded nations, since they serve to prune away the luxuriant growth of the human race."<ref name="Neurath94-page8"/> . 

[[Ibn Khaldoun]], a famous [[North African]] [[Arab]] [[polymath]] (1332–1406), considered population changes to be connected to economic development, linking high birth rates and low death rates to times of economic upswing, and low birth rates and high death rates to economic downswing. Khaldoun concluded that high [[population density]] rather than high absolute population numbers were desirable to achieve more efficient division of labour and cheap administration. <ref name=Neurath94-page8 >{{cite book |title=From Malthus to the Club of Rome and Back |last= Neurath |first=Paul |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1994 |publisher= M.E. Sharpe|location= |isbn=1563244071, 9781563244070 |pages=8 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_ZHx3GO_xLMC&dq=%22population+control%22}}</ref> . 

During the [[Middle Ages]] in Christian Europe, population issues were rarely discussed in isolation. Attitudes were generally pro-[[natalist]] in line with the [[Biblical]] command, "Be ye fruitful and multiply."<ref name=Neurath94-page8 /> . 

The means of controlling and regulating populations can be traced back to many cultures. "Infanticide, or the killing of infants and young children, has occurred since early times. In early Rome, the father was given complete power to kill, abandon, or even sell his child. In Greek legend, Odepus was doomed to death until he was rescued by a family retainer. In Hawaii, China, and Japan, many female or disabled children were killed to maintain a strong race without overpopulation. Infanticide was practiced for many reasons. Like the Hawaiians, Chinese, and Japanese, some cultures saw the practice of infanticide as a means of controlling and regulating the population so that society's resources could be expended on the strongest and most valuable (Crosson, Cynthia)." . 

===16th and 17th centuries===. 
European cities grew more rapidly than before, and throughout the 16th century and early 17th century discussions on the advantages and disadvantages of population growth were frequent. <ref name="Neurath 1994 10">{{cite book |title=From Malthus to the Club of Rome and Back |last= Neurath |first=Paul |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1994 |publisher= M.E.

He is also going to feed them."<ref name="Neurath 1994 9"/> . 

[[Jean Bodin]], a French [[jurist]] and [[political philosophy|political philosopher]] (1530–1596), argued that a larger population would mean more production and in turn more export, which would increase the influx of silver and gold, and thus increase the riches of a country. <ref name="Neurath 1994 9"/> [[Giovanni Botero]], an Italian priest and diplomat (1540–1617), emphasized that, "the greatness of a city rests on the multitude of its inhabitants and their power," but pointed out that a population cannot increase beyond its food supply. If this limit was approached, late marriage, emigration, and war would serve to restore the balance. <ref name="Neurath 1994 9"/> . 

[[Richard Hakluyt]], an English writer (1527–1616), observed that, "Throughe our longe peace and seldome sickness... wee are growen more populous than ever heretofore;... many thousandes of idle persons are within this realme, which, havinge no way to be sett on worke, be either mutinous and seeke alteration in the state, or at leaste very burdensome to the commonwealthe." Hakluyt believed that this led to crime and full jails and in ''A Discourse on Western Planting'' (1584), Hakluyt advocated for the emigration of the surplus population. <ref name="Neurath 1994 10"/> With the onset of the [[Thirty Year War]] (1618–1648), characterized by widespread devastation and deaths brought on by hunger and disease in [[Europe]], concerns about depopulation returned. <ref>{{cite book |title=From Malthus to the Club of Rome and Back |last= Neurath |first=Paul |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1994 |publisher= M.E. Sharpe|location= |isbn=1563244071, 9781563244070 |pages=10–11 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_ZHx3GO_xLMC&dq=%22population+control%22}}</ref> . 

==The population control movement==. 
In the 20th century, population control proponents have drawn from the insights of [[Thomas Malthus]], a British clergyman and economist who published ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' in 1798. Malthus argued that, "Population, when unchecked, increases in a [[Geometric Progression|geometrical]] ratio. [[Subsistence]] increases only in an [[Arithmetic progression|arithmetical]] ratio." He also outlined the idea of "positive checks" and "preventative checks." "Positive checks," such as [[diseases]], [[war]], [[disaster]] and [[famine]], are factors that Malthus considered to increase the death rate. <ref name="geography.about.com">Rosenberg, M. (2007, September 09). Thomas Malthus on Population. Retrieved June 20, 2009, from About.com [http://geography.about.com/od/populationgeography/a/malthus.htm "Geography Web site"]</ref> . 

"Preventative checks" were factors that Malthus believed to affect the birth rate such as moral restraint, abstinence and birth control. <ref name="geography.about.com"/> He predicted that "positive checks" on [[exponential growth|exponential population growth]] would ultimately save humanity from itself and that human misery was an "absolute necessary consequence."<ref name="Knudsen 2006 2–3">{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=0826515282, 9780826515285 |pages=2–3 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=b3thCcdyScsC&dq=reproductive+rights&cad=0 }}</ref> Malthus went on to explain why he believed that this misery affected the poor in a disproportionate manner.  . 

<blockquote>
[There is a] constant effort towards an increase in population [which tends to] subject the lower classes of society to distress and to prevent any great permanent amelioration of their condition…The way in which these effects are produced seems to be this. We will suppose the means of subsistence in any country just equal to the easy support of its inhabitants. The constant effort towards population …increases the number of people before the means of subsistence are increased. The food, therefore which before supplied seven millions must now be divided among seven millions and half or eight millions. The poor consequently must live much worse, and many of them be reduced to severe distress. <ref>Bleier, R. The Home Page of the International Society of Malthus. Retrieved June 20, 2009, from The International Society of Malthus Web site: http://desip.igc.org/malthus/principles.html</ref>
</blockquote> . 

Finally, Malthus advocated for the education of the lower class about the use of "moral restraint," or voluntary abstinence, which he believed would slow the growth rate. <ref>Thomas Robert Malthus, 1766-1834. Retrieved June 20, 2009, from The History of Economic Thought Website Web site: http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/profiles/malthus.htm</ref> . 

[[Paul R. Ehrlich]], a US biologist and environmentalist, published ''[[The Population Bomb]]'' in 1968, advocating stringent population control policies. <ref>{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=0826515282, 9780826515285 |pages=3 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=b3thCcdyScsC&dq=reproductive+rights&cad=0}}</ref> His central argument on population is as follows: . 

<blockquote>
A cancer is an uncontrolled multiplication of cells; the population explosion is an uncontrolled multiplication of people. Treating only the symptoms of cancer may make the victim more comfortable at first, but eventually he dies - often horribly. A similar fate awaits a world with a population explosion if only the symptoms are treated. We must shift our efforts from treatment of the symptoms to the cutting out of the cancer. The operation will demand many apparent brutal and heartless decisions. The pain may be intense. But the disease is so far advanced that only with radical surgery does the patient have a chance to survive. <ref name="Knudsen 2006 3">{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=0826515282, 9780826515285 |pages=3 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=b3thCcdyScsC&dq=reproductive+rights&cad=0 }}</ref>
</blockquote>
[[Image:World population history.svg|thumb|280px|World population 1950–2010]]
In his concluding chapter, Ehrlich offered a partial solution to the "population problem,"
"[We need] compulsory birth regulation... [through] the addition of temporary sterilants to water supplies or staple food. Doses of the antidote would be carefully rationed by the government to produce the desired family size". <ref name="Knudsen 2006 3"/> . 

Ehrlich's views came to be accepted by many population control advocates in the United States and Europe in the 1960s and 1970s. <ref>{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=0826515282, 9780826515285 |pages=3–4 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=b3thCcdyScsC&dq=reproductive+rights&cad=0 }}</ref> Since Ehrlich introduced his idea of the "population bomb," overpopulation has been blamed for a variety of issues, including increasing poverty, high unemployment rates, environmental degradation, famine and genocide. <ref name="Knudsen 2006 2–3"/> In a 2004 interview, Ehrlich reviewed the predictions in his book, and found that while the specific dates within his predictions may have been wrong, his predictions about climate change and disease were valid. Ehrlich continued to advocate for population control and co-authored the book ''The Population Explosion'', released in 1990 with his wife Anne Ehrlich.  . 

Paige Whaley Eager argues that the shift in perception that occurred in the 1960s must be understood in the context of the demographic changes that took place at the time. <ref name=WhaleyEager>{{cite book |title=Global Population Policy |last= Whaley Eager |first=Paige |year=2004 |publisher= Ashgate Publishing|location= |isbn=0754641627, 9780754641629 |pages=36|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=G2WBj4BDLqYC&dq=reproductive+rights&cad=0 }}</ref> It was only in the first decade of the 19th century that the world's population reached one billion. The second billion was added in the 1930s, and the next billion in the 1960s. 90 percent of this net increase occurred in developing countries. <ref name=WhaleyEager/> Eager also argues that, at the time, the [[United States]] recognised that these demographic changes could significantly affect global geopolitics. Large increases occurred in [[China]], [[Mexico]] and [[Nigeria]], and demographers warned of a "population explosion," particularly in developing countries from the mid-1950s onwards. <ref>{{cite book |title=Global Population Policy |last= Whaley Eager |first=Paige |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2004 |publisher= Ashgate Publishing|location= |isbn=0754641627, 9780754641629 |pages=37|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=G2WBj4BDLqYC&dq=reproductive+rights&cad=0 }}</ref> . 

==Population control and economics==. 
{{See also| Demographic-economic paradox | demographic gift}}
Opinions vary among economists about the effects of population change on a nation's economic health. Recent US scientific research concluded that the raising of a child costs about $16,000 yearly ($291,570 total for raising him/her up to his/her 18th birthday). <ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE57367220090804 | work=Reuters | first=Charles | last=Abbott | title=Pricetag to raise a child -- $291,570, says U.S | date=August 4, 2009}}</ref> In the USA, the multiplication of this number with the yearly population growth will yield the overall cost of the population growth. Costs for other developed countries are usually of similar order of magnitude.  . 

While some believe that reduction of the population is a key to economic growth, others argue that population reduction should be focused on what they judge to be undesirable sections of the population (see [[Eugenics]]). Other economists doubt that a correlation between population reduction and economic growth exists. Some economists, such as [[Thomas Sowell]]<ref>[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/sowell021298.html%22 Thomas Sowell Julian Simon, combatant in a 200-year war] Thomas Sowell, February 12, 1998</ref> and [[Walter E. Williams]],<ref>[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/williams022499.asp Population control nonsense] Walter Williams, February 24, 1999</ref> have argued that poverty and famine are caused by bad government and bad economic policies, not by overpopulation.  . 

In his book, [[The Ultimate Resource]], economist [[Julian Lincoln Simon|Julian Simon]] argued that higher population density leads to more [[Specialization (functional)|specialization]] and [[technological innovation]], which in turn leads to a higher standard of living. He claimed that human beings are the ultimate resource since we possess "productive and inventive minds that help find creative solutions to man’s problems, thus leaving us better off over the long run". <ref>Moore, S. (1998, March/April). Julian Simon Remembered: it's a Wonderful Life. Retrieved June 25, 2009, from [http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/cpr-20n2-1.html CATO Institute Web site]</ref> He also claimed that, "Our species is better off in just about every measurable material way."<ref name="wired.com">Regis, E.

Simon also claimed that if you considered a list of [[List of countries by population density|countries ranked in order by population density]], there is no correlation between population density and poverty and starvation, and instead, if you considered a list of [[Corruption Perceptions Index|countries ranked in order by corruption within their respective governments]], there is a significant correlation between government corruption and poverty and famine. <ref>[http://www.juliansimon.com/writings/Ultimate_Resource/ The Ultimate Resource 2] Julian Simon</ref> . 

==Contemporary research==. 
It is generally accepted that overpopulation is aggravated by poverty and gender inequality with consequent unavailability, and lack of knowledge, of contraception. Third world evidence usually bears this theory out. However, first and second world fertility rates, in the Depression era United States, modern Russia, Japan, Italy, Sweden, Estonia and France suggest that these populations are responding inversely to poverty and economic pressures, especially on women. <ref>[http://www.ippf.org/en/News/Intl+news/ IPPF.org]</ref> Thus, France is increasing social and women's services, like childcare and parental leave, expecting the policy to stop the aging of its population. Italy is regarded as alleviating overpopulation more rapidly than Sweden as a result of less gender equality and fewer children's services.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} . 

Newer research has been done by the U.S. [[National Security Council (USA)|National Security Council]], in a study entitled [[National Security Study Memorandum 200]], under the direction of [[Henry Kissinger]] in 1974. This report stressed that only 13 countries are projected to account for 47 percent of the world population increase by the year 2050. This, it is argued, (due to its impact on development, food requirements, resources and the environment) adversely affected the welfare and progress of countries concerned. It further argued that this would undermine the stability of countries friendly to the US and therefore harm the "national security" of the US as well. <ref>[http://www.population-security.org/28-APP2.html Population-security.org]</ref> . 

David Pimentel, professor of ecology and agriculture at [[Cornell University]], and Mario Giampietro, senior researcher at the National Research Institute on Food and Nutrition (INRAN), place in their study ''Food, Land, Population and the U.S. Economy'' the maximum [[U.S. population]] for a [[sustainability|sustainable economy]] at 200 million. To achieve a sustainable economy and avert disaster, the United States must reduce its population by at least one-third, and [[world population]] will have to be reduced by two-thirds, says the study. <ref name="energybulletin.net">[http://www.energybulletin.net/281.html Eating Fossil Fuels | EnergyBulletin.net]</ref>
A more recent study by Pimentel and colleagues (2010) suggests that the Earth can support a population of two billion individuals, but only if all individuals are willing to live at a European standard of living and use natural resources [[sustainability|sustainably]].  These researchers state that reducing population from today's level of over 6.8 billion to the suggested 2 billion would take slightly longer than 100 years if every couple, worldwide, agrees to produce an average of only one child. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Pimentel|first=David|coauthors=Michele Whitecraft, Zachary R.

Pimentel and Giampietro believe that agricultural crises will develop, but they will only begin to impact us after 2020, and will not become critical until 2050. <ref name="energybulletin.net"/>  Geologist [[Dale Allen Pfeiffer]] claims that coming decades could see spiraling food prices without relief and massive starvation on a global level never experienced before. <ref>[http://www.soilassociation.org/peakoil Peak Oil: the threat to our food security]</ref><ref>[http://europe.theoildrum.com/node/2225 Agriculture Meets Peak Oil]</ref> . 

Another study has been done by the National Audubon Society which recently released a 16-page document called "Population and Habitat: Making the Connection." In this study, population control is widely supported. <ref>[http://www.audubonpopulation.org/factAndStats.html Audubon Society]</ref> . 

==Support for population control==. 
Population control is also increasingly being featured in many environmental documentaries and films. An example is [[The Planet]]-documentary, which describes the ongoing rising human population, its effects on the planet, and the necessity of population control.  . 

As early as 1798, [[Thomas Malthus]] stated in his [[Essay on the Principle of Population]] that population control needed to be implemented into society. Around the year 1900, Sir [[Francis Galton]] said in his publication called "[[Hereditary Improvement]]" that, "The unfit could become enemies to the State, if they continue to propagate." In 1968, Paul Ehrlich noted in ''[[The Population Bomb]]'' that, "We must cut the cancer of population growth," and that, "if this was not done, there would be only one other solution, namely the ‘death rate solution’ in which we raise the death rate through war-famine-pestilence etc.” . 

In the same year, another prominent modern advocate for mandatory population control was [[Garrett Hardin]], who proposed in his landmark 1968 essay ''[[Tragedy of the commons|The Tragedy of the Commons]]'' that society must relinquish the "freedom to breed" through "mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon." Later on, in 1972, he reaffirmed his support in his new essay “[[Exploring New Ethics for Survival]]”, by stating that, “We are breeding ourselves into oblivion.” Many prominent personalities, such as [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Margaret Sanger]] (1939), [[John D. Rockefeller]], [[Frederick Osborn]] (1952), [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Jacques Cousteau]] have also advocated for population control.  . 

Today, a number of influential people advocate population control. They are: .

The head of the UN [[Millennium Project]] [[Jeffrey Sachs]] is also a heavy proponent of decreasing the effects of overpopulation. In 2007, Jeffrey Sachs gave a number of lectures (2007 [[Reith Lectures]]) about population control and overpopulation. In his lectures, called "[[Bursting at the seams (Reith lectures)|Bursting at the Seams]]", he featured an integrated approach that would deal with a number of problems associated with overpopulation and [[poverty reduction]]. For example, when criticized for advocating mosquito nets he argued that child survival was, "by far one of the most powerful ways," to achieve fertility reduction, as this would assure poor families that the smaller number of children they had would survive. <ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/reith2007/lecture1.shtml BBC.co.uk] Bursting at the Seams</ref> . 

==Opposition to population control==. 
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] has opposed abortion, sterilization, and contraception as a general practice, but specifically in regard to population control policies.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} [[Pope Benedict XVI]] has stated that "The extermination of millions of unborn children, in the name of the fight against poverty, actually constitutes the destruction of the poorest of all human beings". <ref name="Vatican.va">[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/messages/peace/documents/hf_ben-xvi_mes_20081208_xlii-world-day-peace_en.html Vatican.va]</ref> . 

==Present-day practice by countries==. 
===China===. 
{{Main|One-child policy}}
The most significant modern population control system is [[China]]'s [[one-child policy]], in which, with various exceptions, having more than one child is discouraged. Unauthorized births are punished by fines, although there have also been allegations of illegal forced [[abortion]]s and [[forced sterilization]]. <ref name=dewey>Arthur E. Dewey, Assistant Secretary for Population, Refugees and Migration Testimony before the House International Relations Committee Washington, DC December 14, 2004 http://statelists.state.gov/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0412c&L=dossdo&P=401</ref> . 

The Chinese government introduced the policy in 1978 to alleviate the social and [[Environmental issues in the People's Republic of China|environmental problems of China]]. <ref>Pascal Rocha da Silva, "La politique de l'enfant unique en République Populaire de Chine", 2006, [[Université de Genève]], p. 22-28., cf. [http://www.sinoptic.ch/textes/recherche/2006/200608_Rocha.Pascal_memoire.pdf Sinoptic.ch]</ref> According to government officials, the policy has helped prevent 400 million births. The success of the policy has been questioned, and reduction in fertility has also been attributed to the modernization of China. <ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7000931.stm | work=BBC News | title=Has China's one-child policy worked? | date=September 20, 2007}}</ref> The policy is controversial both within and outside of China because of the issues it raises, the manner in which the policy has been implemented and because of concerns about negative economic and social consequences.  . 

===India===. 
{{Main|Family planning in India}}
Only those with two or fewer children are eligible for election to a [[Gram panchayat]], or local government.  . 

''We two, ours two ("Hum do, hamare do" in Hindi)'' is a slogan meaning ''one family, two children'' and is intended to reinforce the message of family planning thereby aiding population control.  . 

===Iran===. 
{{Main|Family planning in Iran}}
[[Iran]] has succeeded in sharply reducing its birth rate in recent years. Iran is the only country where mandatory contraceptive courses are required for both males and females before a marriage license can be obtained. The government emphasizes the benefits of smaller families and the use of contraception. <ref>[http://www.earth-policy.org/Updates/Update4ss.htm Iran's Birth Rate Plummeting at Record Pace]</ref> . 

=== Singapore ===.

===United States===. 
Enacted in 1970, [[Title X]] of the [[Public Health Service Act]] provides access to contraceptive services, supplies and information to those in need. Priority for services is given to people with low-incomes. The Title X Family Planning program is administered through the Office of Population Affairs under the Office of Public Health and Science. 
It is directed by the Office of Family Planning. <ref name="pop">[http://opa.osophs.dhhs.gov/titlex/ofp.html Office of Population Affairs]</ref> In 2007, Congress appropriated roughly $283 million for family planning under Title X, at least 90 percent of which was used for services in family planning clinics. <ref name="pop" />
Title X is a vital source of funding for family planning clinics throughout the nation,<ref name="pp">[http://www.plannedparenthood.org/news-articles-press/politics-policy-issues/birth-control-access-prevention/family-planning-6553.htm Planned Parenthood, Title X]</ref> which provide reproductive health care.  . 

The education and services supplied by the Title X-funded clinics support young individuals and low-income families. The goals of developing healthy families are accomplished by helping individuals and couples decide whether to have children and when the appropriate time to do so would be. <ref name="pp" /> . 

Title X has made the prevention of [[unintended pregnancies]] possible. <ref name="pp" /> It has allowed millions of American women to receive necessary reproductive health care, plan their pregnancies and prevent abortions. Title X is dedicated exclusively to funding family planning and reproductive health care services. <ref name="pop" /> . 

Title X as a percentage of total public funding to family planning client services has steadily declined from 44% of total expenditures in 1980 to 12% in 2006. Medicaid has increased from 20% to 71% in the same time. In 2006, Medicaid contributed $1.3 billion to public family planning. <ref>Sonfield A, Alrich C and Gold RB, Public funding for family planning, sterilization and abortion services, FY 1980–2006, Occasional Report, New York: Guttmacher Institute, 2008, No. 38. </ref> .
