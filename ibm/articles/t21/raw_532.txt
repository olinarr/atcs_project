Reproductive rights may include some or all of the following: the right to legal or safe [[abortion]], the right to [[birth control]], the right to access quality [[reproductive health]]care, and the right to [[family planning|education and access]] in order to make free and informed reproductive choices. <ref name="AMNESTY"/> Reproductive rights may also include the right to receive [[sex education|education]] about [[contraception]] and [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]], and freedom from [[compulsory sterilization|coerced sterilization]], abortion, and contraception, and protection from gender-based practices such as [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM) and [[male genital mutilation]] (MGM). <ref name="COOK"/><ref name="AMNESTY"/><ref name="FREEDMAN"/><ref>[http://www.nocirc.org/symposia/fourth/zavales4.html Template<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> .

Thus, while some of these rights have already been recognized in [[soft law|hard law]], that is, in legally binding [[international human rights instruments]], others have been mentioned only in non binding recommendations and, therefore, have at best the status of [[soft law]] in [[international law]], while a further group is yet to be accepted by the international community and therefore remains at the level of [[advocacy]]. <ref>Center for Reproductive Rights, International Legal Program, [http://thomas.loc.gov  Establishing International Reproductive Rights Norms: Theory for Change], US CONG.

"We have been leaders in bringing arguments for a woman's right to choose abortion within the rubric of international human rights. However, there is no binding hard norm that recognizes women's right to terminate a pregnancy. (...) While there are hard norms prohibiting sex discrimination that apply to girl adolescents, these are problematic since they must be applied to a substantive right (i.e., the right to health) and the substantive reproductive rights of adolescents are not `hard' (yet!). There are no hard norms on age discrimination that would protect adolescents' ability to exercise their rights to reproductive health, sexual education, or reproductive decisionmaking. In addition, there are no hard norms prohibiting discrimination based on marital status, which is often an issue with respect to unmarried adolescents' access to reproductive health services and information. The soft norms support the idea that the hard norms apply to adolescents under 18. They also fill in the substantive gaps in the hard norms with respect to reproductive health services and information as well as adolescents' reproductive autonomy. (...) There are no hard norms in international human rights law that directly address HIV/AIDS directly. At the same time, a number of human rights bodies have developed soft norms to secure rights that are rendered vulnerable by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. (...) Practices with implications for women's reproductive rights in relation to HIV/AIDS are still not fully covered under existing international law, although soft norms have addressed them to some extent. (...) There is a lack of explicit prohibition of mandatory testing of HIV-positive pregnant women under international law. (...) None of the global human rights treaties explicitly prohibit child marriage and no treaty prescribes an appropriate minimum age for marriage. The onus of specifying a minimum age at marriage rests with the states' parties to these treaties. (...) We have to rely extensively on soft norms that have evolved from the TMBs and that are contained in conference documents to assert that child marriage is a violation of fundamental human rights."</blockquote></ref> . 

According to [[pro-choice]] activist{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Laura Knudsen, issues related to reproductive rights are some of the most vigorously contested rights' issues worldwide, regardless of the population's [[socioeconomic]] level, [[religion]] or [[culture]]. <ref>{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=0826515282, 9780826515285 |pages=1 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&dq=reproductive+rights }}</ref> . 

==History==. 
===Proclamation of Teheran===. 
In 1945, the [[UN Charter]] included the obligation "to promote... universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without discrimination as to race, sex, language, or religion". However, the Charter did not define these rights. Three years later, the [[United Nations|UN]] adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), the first international legal document to delineate human rights; the [[UDHR]] does not mention reproductive rights.  Reproductive rights began to appear as a subset of [[human rights]] in the 1968 Proclamation of Teheran, which states: "Parents have a basic right to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children and a right to adequate education and information in this respect". <ref name=teheran_proc />  . 

This right was affirmed by the UN General Assembly in the 1974 [[Declaration on Social Progress and Development]] which states "The family as a basic unit of society and the natural environment for the growth and well-being of all its members, particularly children and youth, should be assisted and protected so that it may fully assume its responsibilities within the community. Parents have the exclusive right to determine freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children."<ref name="FREEDMAN"/><ref>[http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/m_progre.htm Declaration on Social Progress and Development<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The 1975 UN International Women's Year Conference echoed the Proclamation of Teheran.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} . 

===Cairo Programme of Action===. 
The twenty year "Cairo Programme of Action" was adopted in 1994 at the [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (ICPD) in [[Cairo]]. The [[Non-binding resolution|non binding]] Programme of Action asserted that governments have a responsibility to meet individuals' reproductive needs, rather than demographic targets. It recommended that [[Family planning]] services be provided in the context of other reproductive health services, including services for healthy and safe childbirth, care for sexually transmitted infections, and post-abortion care. The ICPD also addressed issues such as violence against women, sex trafficking, and adolescent health. <ref name="Knudsen 2006 5–6">{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=0826515282, 9780826515285 |pages=5–6 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&dq=reproductive+rights }}</ref> The Cairo Program is the first international policy document to define [[reproductive health]],<ref name="Knudsen 2006 5–6"/> stating:
<blockquote>Reproductive health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and its functions and processes. Reproductive health therefore implies that people are able to have a satisfying and safe sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so. Implicit in this last condition are the right of men and women to be informed [about] and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of family planning of their choice, as well as other methods for regulation of fertility which are not against the law, and the right of access to appropriate health-care services that will enable women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth and provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant [para. 72]. <ref name="COOK"/></blockquote> . 

Unlike previous population conferences, a wide range of interests from grassroots to government level were represented in Cairo. 179 nations attended the ICPD and overall eleven thousand representatives from governments, NGOs, international agencies and citizen activists participated. <ref name="Knudsen 2006 5–6"/> The ICPD did not address the far-reaching implications of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In 1999, recommendations at the ICPD+5 were expanded to include commitment to AIDS education, research, and prevention of mother-to-child transmission, as well as to the development of vaccines and microbicides. <ref name="Knudsen 2006 7">{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=0826515282, 9780826515285 |pages=7 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&dq=reproductive+rights }}</ref> . 

The Cairo Programme of Action was adopted by 184 UN member states. Nevertheless, many Latin American and Islamic States made [[Reservation (law)|formal reservations]] to the programme, in particular, to its concept of reproductive rights and sexual freedom, to its treatment of abortion, and to its potential incompatibility with Islamic Law. <ref name="un.org">[http://www.un.org/popin/icpd/conference/offeng/poa.html United Nations, Report of the Fourth International Conference on Population and Development, Cario, 5 - 13 September 1994]</ref> . 

===Beijing Platform===. 
The 1995 [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in Beijing, in its [[non-binding resolution|non-binding]] Declaration and Platform for Action, supported the Cairo Programme's definition of reproductive health, but established a broader context of reproductive rights:
<blockquote>The human rights of women include their right to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. Equal relationships between women and men in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for the integrity of the person, require mutual respect, consent and shared responsibility for sexual behavior and its consequences [para. 96]. <ref name="COOK"/></blockquote> The Beijing Platform demarcated twelve interrelated critical areas of the human rights of women that require advocacy. The Platform framed women's reproductive rights as "indivisible, universal and inalienable human rights."<ref name="BUNCH">{{cite journal |last=Bunch |first=Charlotte |coauthors=Susana Fried |year=1996 |month=Autumn |title=Beijing '95: Moving Women's Human Rights from Margin to Center |journal=Signs |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=200–204 |accessdate=2007-12-11 |doi=10.1086/495143 |jstor=3175048}}</ref> . 

===The Yogyakarta Principles===. 
[[The Yogyakarta Principles]] on the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, proposed by a group of experts in November 2006<ref name = YOGYABOUT>[http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles_en_about.htm About the Yogyakarta Principles]</ref> but not yet incorporated by States in international law,<ref>International Service for Human Rights, [http://www.ishr.ch/archive-general-assembly/933-majority-of-ga-third-committee-unable-to-accept-report-on-the-human-right-to-sexual-education Majority of GA Third Committee unable to accept report on the human right to sexual education ]</ref> declares in its Preamble that "the [[international community]] has recognized the rights of persons to decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free from coercion, discrimination, and violence." In relation to reproductive health, Principle 9 on "The Right to Treatment with Humanity while in Detention" requires that "States shall... <nowiki>[p]rovide</nowiki> adequate access to medical care and counseling appropriate to the needs of those in custody, recognizing any particular needs of persons on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity, including with regard to reproductive health, access to [[HIV/AIDS]] information and therapy and access to [[hormone therapy|hormonal]] or other therapy as well as to [[sex reassignment therapy|gender-reassignment treatments]] where desired."<ref>"The Yogyakarta Principles" Preamble and Principle 9. The Rights to Treatment with Humanity While in Detention</ref> Nonetheless, African, Caribbean and Islamic Countries, as well as the [[Russian Federation]], have objected to the use of these principles as Human Rights standards. <ref>United Nations General Assembly, Official Records, Third Committee, [http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N09/576/53/PDF/N0957653.pdf?OpenElement Summary record of the 29th meeting held in New York, on Monday, 25 October 2010, at 3 p.m]. For instance, [[Malawi]], speaking on behalf of all African States, argued that the Yogyakarta Principles were "controversial and unrecognized," while the representative of the Russian Federation said that they "had not been agreed to at the intergovernmental level, and which therefore could not be considered as authoritative expressions of the opinion of the international community" (para. 9, 23). </ref> . 

==Human rights==. 
{{see also|Human rights}}
Since most existing legally binding [[international human rights instruments]] do not explicitly mention sexual and reproductive rights, a [[Epistemic community (international relations)|broad coalition]] of [[NGO]]s, civil servants, and experts working in [[international organizations]] have been promoting a reinterpretation of those instruments to link the realization of the already internationally recognized human rights with the realization of reproductive rights. <ref>Amnesty International, [http://www.amnesty.org/en/human-rights-defenders/issues/challenges/srr-defenders Defenders of Sexual and Reproductive Rights]; [http://www.iwhc.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3326&Itemid=548 International Women’s Health Coalition and the United Nations],  [http://www.iwhc.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=205&Itemid=110 Campaign for an Inter-American Convention on Sexual and Reproductive Rights ], Women's Health Collection, [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/_/print/PrintArticle.aspx?id=105915323 Abortion as a human right: possible strategies in unexplored territory. (Sexual Rights and Reproductive Rights),] (2003); and Shanthi Dairiam, [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/_/print/PrintArticle.aspx?id=90988094   Applying the CEDAW Convention for the recognition of women's health rights], Arrows For Change, (2002).  In this regard, the Center for Reproductive Rights has noted that: <blockquote>
"Our goal is to ensure that governments worldwide guarantee women's reproductive rights out of an understanding that they are bound to do so. The two principal prerequisites for achieving this goal are: (1) the strengthening of international legal norms protecting reproductive rights; and (2) consistent and effective action on the part of civil society and the international community to enforce these norms. Each of these conditions, in turn, depends upon profound social change at the local, national and international (including regional) levels. (...) Ultimately, we must persuade governments to accept reproductive rights as binding norms. Again, our approach can move forward on several fronts, with interventions both at the national and international levels. Governments' recognition of reproductive rights norms may be indicated by their support for progressive language in international conference documents or by their adoption and implementation of appropriate national-level legislative and policy instruments. In order to counter opposition to an expansion of recognized reproductive rights norms, we have questioned the credibility of such reactionary yet influential international actors as the United States and the Holy See. Our activities to garner support for international protections of reproductive rights include: Lobbying government delegations at UN conferences and producing supporting analyses/materials; fostering alliances with members of civil society who may become influential on their national delegations to the UN; and preparing briefing papers and factsheets exposing the broad anti-woman agenda of our opposition."</blockquote>Center for Reproductive Rights, International Legal Program, [http://thomas.loc.gov  Establishing International Reproductive Rights Norms: Theory for Change], US CONG. REC. 108th CONG. 1 Sess. E2534 E2547 (Rep. Smith) (Dec. 8, 2003)</ref> An example of this linkage is provided by the 1994 Cairo Programme of Action: <blockquote>
"reproductive rights embrace certain human rights that are already recognized in national laws, international human rights documents and other relevant United Nations consensus documents. These rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. It also includes the right of all to make decisions concerning reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence as expressed in human rights documents. In the exercise of this right, they should take into account the needs of their living and future children and their responsibilities towards the community."<ref>http://www.iisd.ca/Cairo/program/p07002.html</ref></blockquote>
Similarly, [[Amnesty International]] has argued that the realisation of reproductive rights is linked with the realisation of a series of recognised [[human rights]], including the [[right to health]], the right to freedom from [[discrimination]], the [[right to privacy]], and the right not to be subjected to torture or ill-treatment. <ref name="AMNESTY">{{cite web |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/Stop_Violence_Against_Women_SVAW/Reproductive_Rights/page.do?id=1108242&n1=3&n2=39&n3=1101 |title=Stop Violence Against Women: Reproductive rights |accessdate=2007-12-08 |author=Amnesty International USA |year=2007 |work=SVAW |publisher=Amnesty International USA }}</ref> However, not all states have accepted the inclusion of reproductive rights in the body of internationally recognized human rights. At the Cairo Conference, several states made [[Reservation (law)|formal reservations]] either to the concept of reproductive rights or to its specific content.  [[Ecuador]], for instance, stated that: <blockquote>
"With regard to the Programme of Action of the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development and in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and laws of Ecuador and the norms of international law, the delegation of Ecuador reaffirms, inter alia, the following principles embodied in its Constitution:  the inviolability of life, the protection of children from the moment of conception, freedom of conscience and religion, the protection of the family as the fundamental unit of society, responsible paternity, the right of parents to bring up their children and the formulation of population and development plans by the Government in accordance with the principles of respect for sovereignty. Accordingly, the delegation of Ecuador enters a reservation with respect to all terms such as "regulation of fertility", "interruption of pregnancy", "reproductive health", "reproductive rights" and "unwanted children", which in one way or another, within the context of the Programme of Action, could involve abortion."<ref name="un.org"/></blockquote>
Similar reservations were made by [[Argentina]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Malta]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]] and the [[Holy See]]. Islamic Countries, such as [[Brunei]], [[Djibouti]], [[Iran]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Libya]], [[Syria]], [[United Arab Emirates]], and [[Yemen]] made broad reservations against any element of the programme that could be interpreted as contrary to the [[Sharia]]. Guatemala even questioned whether the conference could legally proclaim new human rights. <ref>[http://www.un.org/popin/icpd/conference/offeng/poa.html United Nations, Report of the Fourth International Conference on Population and Development, Cario, 5 - 13 September 1994]. Guatemala entered the following reservation:<blockquote>
"Chapter VII:  we enter a reservation on the whole chapter, for the General Assembly's mandate to the Conference does not extend to the creation or formulation of rights; this reservation therefore applies to all references in the document to "reproductive rights", "sexual rights", "reproductive health", "fertility regulation", "sexual health", "individuals", "sexual education and services for minors", "abortion in all its forms", "distribution of contraceptives" and "safe motherhood"</blockquote></ref> . 

==Women's rights==. 
{{see also|Women’s rights|Reproductive justice}} . 

The [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) advocate for reproductive rights with a primary emphasis on [[women's rights]]. In this respect the UN and WHO focus on a range of issues from access to [[family planning]] services, sex education, [[menopause]], and the reduction of [[obstetric fistula]], to the relationship between reproductive health and economic status.  . 

The reproductive rights of women are advanced in the context of the right to freedom from [[discrimination]] and the social and economic status of women. The group Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era (DAWN) explained the link in the following statement:
<blockquote>Control over reproduction is a basic need and a basic right for all women. Linked as it is to women's health and social status, as well as the powerful social structures of religion, state control and administrative inertia, and private profit, it is from the perspective of poor women that this right can best be understood and affirmed. Women know that childbearing is a social, not a purely personal, phenomenon; nor do we deny that world population trends are likely to exert considerable pressure on resources and institutions by the end of this century. But our bodies have become a pawn in the struggles among states, religions, male heads of households, and private corporations. Programs that do not take the interests of women into account are unlikely to succeed... <ref name="FREEDMAN"/></blockquote> . 

Attempts have been made to analyse the socioeconomic conditions that affect the realisation of a woman's reproductive rights. The term [[reproductive justice]] has been used to describe these broader social and economic issues. Proponents of reproductive justice argue that while the right to [[abortion law|legalized abortion]]<ref>http://womenshistory.about.com/library/etext/gov/bl_roe_e.htm "RoeVSWade"</ref> and contraception applies to everyone, these choices are only meaningful to those with resources, and that there is a growing gap between access and affordability.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}<ref>Kirk, Okazawa-Rey 2004</ref> . 

==Men's rights==. 
{{see also|Men's rights}}
Men's reproductive rights have been claimed by various organizations, both for issues of reproductive health, and other rights related to sexual reproduction.  . 

Three international issues in men's reproductive health are [[sexually transmitted disease]]s, cancer and exposure to [[toxins]]. <ref name = "NETWORK">{{cite web |url=http://www.fhi.org/en/RH/Pubs/Network/v18_3/NW183ch2.htm |title=Men's Reproductive Health Risks: Threats to men's fertility and reproductive health include disease, cancer and exposure to toxins. |accessdate=2008-01-02 |author=Best, Kim |year=2006 |work=Network:Spring 1998, Vol. 18, No. 3 |publisher=Family Health International}}</ref> . 

Recently men's reproductive right with regards to paternity have become subject of debate in the U.S.  The term "[[male abortion]]" was coined by Melanie McCulley, a South Carolina attorney, in a 1998 article.  The theory begins with the premise that when a woman becomes pregnant she has the option of abortion, adoption, or parenthood; it argues, in the context of legally recognized [[gender equality]], that in the earliest stages of pregnancy the putative (alleged) father should have the right to relinquish all future parental rights and financial responsibility, leaving the informed mother with the same three options. <ref>{{cite journal | author = McCulley Melanie G | year = 1998 | title = The male abortion: the putative father's right to terminate his interests in and obligations to the unborn child | url = | journal = The Journal of Law and Policy | volume = VII | issue =1 | pages =1–55 |pmid=12666677 }}</ref> This concept has been supported by a former president of the feminist organization [[National Organization for Women]], attorney [[Karen DeCrow]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/life/feature/2000/10/19/mens_choice|title=A man's right to choose|last1=Young|first1=Kathy|date=Oct. 19, 2000|publisher=Salon.com|accessdate= May 10, 2011}}</ref> . 

In 2006, the National Center for Men brought a case in the US, [[Dubay v. Wells]] (dubbed by some "[[Roe v. Wade]] for men"), that argued that in the event of an unplanned pregnancy, when an unmarried woman informs a man that she is pregnant by him, he should have an opportunity to give up all paternity rights and responsibilities.  Supporters argue that this would allow the woman time to make an informed decision and give men the same reproductive rights as women. <ref>Traister, Rebecca. (March 13, 2006).

==Issues==. 
{{Expand section|date=November 2008}} . 

===Cairo Programme of Action implementation===. 
Implementation of the Cairo Programme of Action varies considerably from country to country. In many countries, post-ICPD tensions emerged as the [[human rights]]-based approach was implemented. Since the ICPD, many countries have broadened their reproductive health programs and attempted to integrate maternal and child health services with family planning. More attention is paid to adolescent health and the consequences of unsafe abortion. Lara Knudsen observes that the ICPD succeeded in getting [[feminist]] language into governments' and population agencies' literature, but in many countries the underlying concepts are not widely put into practice. <ref name="Knudsen 2006 7"/> In two preparatory meetings for the ICPD+10 in Asia and Latin America, the United States, under the George W. Bush Administration, was the only nation opposing the ICPD's Programme of Action. <ref>{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=0826515282, 9780826515285 |pages=9 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&dq=reproductive+rights }}</ref> . 

===Abortion===. 
Laura Knudsen, a [[pro-choice]] activist, has suggested that ''"twenty percent of all pregnancies worldwide end in abortion, and nearly half of those abortions are unsafe and often illegal."''<ref>{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=0826515282, 9780826515285 |pages=1–2 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&dq=reproductive+rights }}</ref> According to the WHO, more than 45 million (legal and illegal) abortions take place annually. At the same time, approximately 66,500 women die from the complications of unsafe abortion every year. <ref>According to data repeatedly published by [http://www.ipas.org Ipas]{{Nonspecific|date=June 2010}}. </ref> . 

An article from the World Health Organization calls safe, legal abortion a "[[fundamental right]] of women, irrespective of where they live" and [[unsafe abortion]] a "silent [[pandemic]]". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/unsafe_abortion/ua_paper/en/index.html|title=WHO: Unsafe Abortion - The Preventable Pandemic|accessdate=2010-01-16}}</ref> The article states "ending the silent pandemic of unsafe abortion is an urgent [[public health|public-health]] and [[human-rights]] imperative." It also states "access to safe abortion improves [[women’s health]], and vice versa, as documented in [[Romania]] during the regime of President [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]" and "legalisation of abortion on request is a necessary but insufficient step toward improving women’s health" citing that in some countries, such as India where abortion has been legal for decades, access to competent care remains restricted because of other barriers. WHO’s Global Strategy on Reproductive Health, adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2004, noted: “As a preventable cause of maternal mortality and morbidity, unsafe abortion must be dealt with as part of the MDG on improving maternal health and other international development goals and targets." <ref name="who.int">http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/unsafe_abortion/hrpwork/en/index.html</ref> The WHO's Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP), whose research concerns people's sexual and reproductive health and lives,<ref>http://www.who.int/hrp/en/</ref> has an overall strategy to combat unsafe abortion that comprises four inter-related activities <ref name="who.int"/>:
*to collate, synthesize and generate scientifically sound evidence on unsafe abortion prevalence and practices;
*to develop improved technologies and implement interventions to make abortion safer;
*to translate evidence into norms, tools and guidelines;
*and to assist in the development of programmes and policies that reduce unsafe abortion and improve access to safe abortion and highquality postabortion care . 

When negotiating the Cairo Programme of Action at the 1994 [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (ICPD), the issue was so contentious that delegates eventually decided to omit any recommendation to legalize abortion, instead advising governments to provide proper post-abortion care and to invest in programs that will decrease the number of unwanted pregnancies. <ref>{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=0826515282, 9780826515285 |pages=6 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&dq=reproductive+rights }}</ref> . 

On April 18, 2008 the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]], a group comprising members from 47 European countries, adopted a resolution calling for the decriminalization of abortion within reasonable gestational limits and guaranteed access to safe abortion procedures. The nonbinding resolution was passed on April 16 by a vote of 102 to 69. <ref>http://www.guttmacher.org/media/inthenews/2008/04/18/index.html</ref> . 

During and after the ICPD, some interested parties attempted to interpret the term ‘reproductive health’ in the sense that it implies abortion as a means of family planning or, indeed, a right to abortion. These interpretations, however, do not reflect the consensus reached at the Conference. 
For the European Union, where legislation on abortion is certainly less restrictive than elsewhere, the Council Presidency has clearly stated that the Council’s commitment to promote ‘reproductive health’ did not include the promotion of abortion. <ref>European Parliament, 4 December 2003: Oral Question (H-0794/03) for Question Time at the part-session in December 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Dana Scallon to the Council. In the written record of that session, one reads: Posselt (PPE-DE): “Does the term ‘reproductive health’ include the promotion of abortion, yes or no?” - Antonione, Council: “No.”</ref>  Likewise, the European Commission, in response to a question from a Member of the European Parliament, clarified: . 

''“The term ‘reproductive health’ was defined by the United Nations (UN) in 1994 at the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development. All Member States of the Union endorsed the Programme of Action adopted at Cairo. The Union has never adopted an alternative definition of ‘reproductive health’ to that given in the Programme of Action, '''which makes no reference to abortion'''.”''<ref>European Parliament, 24 October 2002: Question no 86 by Dana Scallon (H-0670/02)</ref> . 

With regard to the US, it should be noted that, only a few days prior to the Cairo Conference, the head of the US delegation, Vice President Al Gore, had stated for the record: . 

''“Let us get a false issue off the table: the US does not seek to establish a new international right to abortion, and we do not believe that abortion should be encouraged as a method of family planning.”''<ref>Jyoti Shankar Singh, Creating a New Consensus on Population (London: Earthscan, 1998), 60</ref> . 

Some years later, the position of the US Administration in this debate was reconfirmed by US Ambassador to the UN, Ellen Sauerbrey, when she stated at a meeting of the UN Commission on the Status of Women that: ''“nongovernmental organizations are attempting to assert that Beijing  in some way creates or contributes to the creation of an internationally recognized fundamental right to abortion”''. <ref>Lederer, AP/San Francisco Chronicle, 1 March 2005</ref> She added: ''“There is no fundamental right to abortion. And yet it keeps coming up largely driven by NGOs trying to hijack the term and trying to make it into a definition”''. <ref>Leopold, Reuters, 28 February 2005</ref> . 

Collaborative research from the [[Institute of Development Studies]] states that "access to safe abortion is a matter of human rights, democracy and public health, and the denial of such access is a major cause of death and impairment, with significant costs to [international] development". <ref name=IDS2009>{{cite journal|url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121649491/issue | title = Unsafe Abortion: A Development Issue | journal = Institute of Development Studies (IDS) Bulletin | volume = 39 | date = July 2009 | issue = 3}}</ref> The research highlights the inequities of access to safe abortion both globally and nationally and emphasises the importance of global and national movements for reform to address this. The shift by campaigners of reproductive rights from an issue-based agenda (the right to abortion), to safe, legal abortion not only as a human right, but bound up with democratic and citizenship rights, has been an important way of reframing the abortion debate and reproductive justice agenda. <ref name=IDS2009 /> . 

Meanwhile, however the [[European Court of Human Rights]] settled the question through a landmark judgment (Case of [[A. B. and C. v. Ireland]]), in which it is stated that the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] does not contain a right to abortion.  . 

===Population control===. 
{{see also|Population control}}
Compulsory or forced sterilizations and abortions may also occur in the context of [[population control]] policies. 
From the 1970s to 1980s, tension grew between women's health activists who advance women's reproductive rights as part of a [[human rights]]-based approach on the one hand, and population control advocates on the other. <ref>{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=0826515282, 9780826515285 |pages=2 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&dq=reproductive+rights }}</ref> At the 1984 UN World Population Conference in Mexico City population control policies came under attack from women's health advocates who argued that the policies' narrow focus led to coercion and decreased quality of care, and that these policies ignored the varied social and cultural contexts in which family planning was provided in developing countries. In the 1980s the HIV/AIDS epidemic forced a broader discussion of sex into the public discourse in many countries, leading to more emphasis on reproductive health issues beyond reducing fertility. The growing opposition to the narrow population control focus led to a significant departure in the early 1990s from past population control policies. <ref>{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=0826515282, 9780826515285 |pages=4–5 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&dq=reproductive+rights }}</ref>  In the United States, abortion opponents have recently begun to accuse reproductive rights advocates of advancing a [[Racism|racist]] agenda of [[eugenics]], and of trying to reduce the [[African American]] population of the U.S. <ref name=Dewan>{{Cite news | last = Dewan | first = Shaila | author-link = http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/d/shaila_dewan/index.html?inline=nyt-per | title = To Court Blacks, Foes of Abortion Make Racial Case | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | date = February 26, 2010 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/27/us/27race.html | accessdate = 7 June 2010 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> . 

===Sperm donation===. 
{{See|Sperm donation|Sperm donor limitation by country}}
Laws in many countries and states require [[sperm donation|sperm donors]] to be either anonymous or known to the recipient, or the laws restrict the number of children each donor may father. Although many donors choose to remain anonymous, new [[technologies]] such as the Internet and DNA technology have opened up new avenues for those wishing to know more about the biological father, siblings and half-siblings.  .

==Criticisms== . 

[[Opposition to the legalization of abortion|Opponents of legalized abortion]] view the term "reproductive rights" as a [[euphemism]] to sway emotions in favor of abortion.  [[National Right to Life]] has referred to "reproductive rights" as a "fudge term" and "the code word for ''abortion'' rights."<ref name=NRLC>{{cite web|title=THE CHOICE "THAT DARE NOT SPEAK ITS NAME"|url=http://www.nrlc.org/news/2003/NRL02/pres.html|year=2003}}</ref> .
