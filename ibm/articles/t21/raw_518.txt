'''Human rights in the People's Republic of China''' are a matter of dispute between the Chinese government, other countries, international NGOs, and dissidents inside the country. Organizations such as the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], [[Amnesty International]], and [[Human Rights Watch]] have accused the Chinese government of restricting the freedoms of [[freedom of speech|speech]], [[freedom of movement|movement]], and [[freedom of religion|religion]] of Chinese citizens. The Chinese government argues for a "wider" definition of [[human rights]], to include [[Economic, social and cultural rights|economic and social]] as well as political rights, all in relation to "[[Cultural relativism|national culture]]" and the [[developing country|level of development]] of the country. <ref name="xinhuanet human rights">{{Cite news

China also repeated many times that its constitution specifies not only citizenship rights but also the "[[Four Cardinal Principles]]"; in legal respects the "Four Cardinal Principles" are higher than citizenship rights, meaning there was a legal basis according to the Chinese constitution when China arrested people who wanted, according to China, to overthrow these principles. Chinese people who obey these principles can, according to the Chinese government, enjoy all Chinese citizenship rights.  . 

However, numerous [[China human rights organizations|human rights organizations]] note multiple problems with the Chinese government. Controversial human rights issues in China include policies such as capital punishment, the [[one-child policy]], the political status of [[Tibet]], and lack of protections regarding freedom of press and religion. One of the foremost areas of concern is a lack of legal rights, for want of an [[Independence of the judiciary|independent judiciary]], [[rule of law]], and [[due process]]. Another prominent area of concern is lack of labor rights, which is related to the [[Hukou system|''hukou'' system]], the absence of independent [[labor union|unions]], and discrimination against rural workers and [[Ethnic minorities in China|ethnic minorities]]. Yet another area of concern is the lack of religious freedom, highlighted by alleged repression of [[Christianity|Christian]],<ref>{{Cite web

===Freedom of movement===. 
{{Details|Hukou system}} . 

The [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] came to power in the late 1940s and instigated a [[command economy]]. In 1958, Mao set up a residency permit system defining where people could work, and classified an individual as a "rural" or "urban" worker. <ref name="autogenerated2">Macleod, Calum. [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-reviews-apartheid-for-900m-peasants-673431.html "China reviews `apartheid' for 900&nbsp;m peasants"], ''[[The Independent]]'', 10 June 2001. </ref> A worker seeking to move from the country to an urban area to take up non-agricultural work would have to apply through the relevant bureaucracies. {{Reference necessary|1=The number of workers allowed to make such moves was tightly controlled.|date=April 2010}} People who worked outside their authorized domain or geographical area would not qualify for grain rations, employer-provided housing, or health care. <ref name=Wildasin>David Pines, Efraim Sadka, Itzhak Zilcha, ''Topics in Public Economics: Theoretical and Applied Analysis'', Cambridge University Press, 1998, p. 334. </ref> There were controls over education, employment, marriage and so on. <ref name="autogenerated2" /> One reason cited for instituting this system was to prevent the possible chaos caused by the predictable large-scale urbanization. <ref>{{cite jstor|655134}}</ref> As a part of the [[one country, two systems]] policy proposed by [[Deng Xiaoping]] and accepted by the British and Portuguese governments, the [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative regions]] of Hong Kong and Macao retained separate border control and immigration policies with the rest of the PRC. Chinese citizens had to gain permission from the government before travelling to Hong Kong or Macau, but this requirement was abolished after the handover. Since then, restrictions imposed by the SAR governments have been the limiting factor on travel.  . 

''[[The Washington Times]]'' reported in 2000 that although migrant labourers play an important part in spreading wealth in Chinese villages, they are treated "like second-class citizens by a system so discriminatory that it has been likened to apartheid."<ref name="autogenerated3">Macleod, Calum and Macleod, Lijia '' China's migrants bear brunt of bias'', The Washington Times, 14 July 2000. </ref> Anita Chan also posits that China's household registration and temporary residence permit system has created a situation analogous to the passbook system in South Africa which was designed to regulate the supply of cheap labor. <ref name=Chan>Chan, Anita, ''China's Workers under Assault: The Exploitation of Labor in a Globalizing Economy'', Introduction chapter, M.E. Sharpe. 2001, ISBN 0-7656-0358-6</ref> In 2000, the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy has alleged that people of [[Han Chinese|Han descent]] in Tibet have a far easier time acquiring the necessary permits to live in urban areas than ethnic Tibetans do. <ref>{{cite web| title = Racial Discrimination in Tibet (2000) | url = http://www.tchrd.org/publications/topical_reports/racial_discrimination-2000/housing/06_restrictions.html | publisher=Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy}}</ref> . 

Abolition of this policy was proposed in 11 provinces, mainly along the developed eastern coast. The law has already been changed such that migrant workers no longer face summary arrest, after a widely publicised incident in 2003, when a university-educated migrant died in Guangdong province. The Beijing law lecturer who exposed the incident said it spelt the end of the [[hukou system]]: in most smaller cities, the system has been abandoned; it has "almost lost its function" in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai. <ref name=rethinks>Luard, Tim.

====Treatment of rural workers====. 
In November 2005 [[Jiang Wenran]], acting director of the China Institute at the [[University of Alberta]], said this system was one of the most strictly enforced 'apartheid' structures in modern world history. <ref name="Wenran">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4424944.stm|title=China rethinks peasant 'apartheid' |last=Luard|first=Tim|date=10 Nov. 2005|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=22 Aug. 2008}}</ref> He stated "Urban dwellers enjoy a range of social, economic and cultural benefits while peasants, the majority of the Chinese population, are treated as second-class citizens". <ref name="Wenran"/> . 

The discrimination enforced by the ''[[hukou system]]'' became particularly onerous in the 1980s after hundreds of millions of migrant laborers were forced out of state corporations and co-operatives. <ref name=TheStar>"Chinese apartheid: Migrant labourers, numbering in hundreds of millions, who have been ejected from state concerns and co-operatives since the 1980s as China instituted "socialist capitalism", have to have six passes before they are allowed to work in provinces other than their own.

Their transient existence is precarious and exploitative. The discrimination against migrant workers in the Chinese case is not racial, but the control mechanisms set in place in the so-called free labor market to regulate the supply of cheap labor, the underlying economic logic of the system, and the abusive consequences suffered by the migrant workers, share many of the characteristics of the apartheid system."

The [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Ministry of Public Security]] justified these practices on the grounds that they assisted the police in tracking down criminals and maintaining public order, and provided demographic data for government planning and programs. <ref name=Laquian>"The ''hukou'' system has been criticized in some quarters and has been called 'the equivalent of and apartheid system between rural and urban residents' (''China Labor Bulletin'', 25 February 2002).

{{Main|Freedom of religion in the People's Republic of China}}
During the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–1976), particularly the [[Four Olds|Destruction of Four Olds]] campaign, religious affairs of all types were persecuted and discouraged by the Communists with many religious buildings looted and destroyed.

The 1982 Constitution guarantees its citizens the right to believe in any religion."''Citizens of the People's Republic of China enjoy freedom of religious belief. No state organ, public organization or individual may compel citizens to believe in, or not to believe in, any religion; nor may they discriminate against citizens who believe in, or do not believe in, any religion.

On 20 July 1999, the government banned [[Falun Gong]] and all 'heterodox religions', and began a nationwide crackdown of the popular [[new religious movement]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://china.hrw.org/search/node/Falun+Gong |title=Search , Human Rights Watch |publisher=China.hrw.org |accessdate=9 May 2011}}</ref> following a demonstration by 10,000 practitioners outside the leadership enclave at Zhongnanhai on 25 April. <ref name=XIX>American Asian Review, Vol. XIX, no. 4, Winter 2001, p. 12</ref> Protests in Beijing were frequent for the first few years following the 1999 edict, though these protests have largely been eradicated. <ref name=wildgrass/> Practitioners have occasionally hacked into state television channels to broadcast pro-Falun Gong materials.

According to Pulitzer prize-winning journalist [[Ian Denis Johnson]], the government mobilized every aspect of society, including the media apparatus, police force, army, education system, families and workplaces, against Falun Gong. <ref name=wildgrass>Johnson, Ian, ''Wild Grass: three portraits of change in modern china'', Vintage 8 Mar.2005)</ref> An extra-constitutional body, the "6–10 Office" was created to do what Forbes describes as "<nowiki>[overseeing]</nowiki> the terror campaign."<ref name=morais>Morais, Richard C.[http://www.forbes.com/technology/2006/02/09/falun-gong-china_cz_rm_0209falungong.html "China's Fight With Falun Gong"], ''Forbes'', 9 February 2006, retrieved 7 Jul. 2006</ref> The campaign was driven by large-scale propaganda through television, newspaper, radio and internet. <ref name=Leung>Leung, Beatrice (2002) 'China and Falun Gong: Party and society relations in the modern era', Journal of Contemporary China, 11:33, 761 – 784</ref> Human Rights Watch noted that families and workplaces were urged to cooperate with the government, while practitioners themselves were subject to various coercive measures to have them recant their beliefs. <ref name=dangerous>Mickey Spiegel, [http://hrw.org/reports/2002/china/ "Dangerous Meditation: China's Campaign Against Falungong"], Human Rights Watch, 2002, accessed 28 Sept 2007</ref> Amnesty International raised particular concerns over reports of torture, illegal imprisonment including forced labor, and psychiatric abuses. <ref>23 Mar.2000) [http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/engASA170112000 The crackdown on Falun Gong and other so-called ''heretical organizations''], Amnesty International</ref><ref>United Nations 4 Feb.2004) [http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2004/hrcn1073.doc.htm Press Release HR/CN/1073], retrieved 12 Sep. 2006</ref> . 

In March 2006, Falun Gong and ''[[The Epoch Times]]'' said that the Chinese government and its agencies, including the [[People's Liberation Army]], were conducting "widespread and systematic organ harvesting of living practitioners" specifically at the Sujiatun Thrombosis Hospital in [[Shenyang]] according to two eye-witness accounts that practitioners detained in the hospital's basement were being tissue-typed, and killed to order. <ref name=epoch2>Ji Da, [http://en.epochtimes.com/news/6-3-17/39405.html New Witness Confirms Existence of Chinese Concentration Camp, Says Organs Removed from Live Victims], Epoch Times, 17 March 2006</ref> In July 2006, [[David Kilgour]] and [[David Matas]], sponsored by Falun Gong to investigate the allegations, published a report which they admitted the evidence was circumstantial, but which taken together supported the allegations that large numbers of Falun Gong practitioners were victims of systematic organ harvesting whilst still alive. <ref>Reuters, AP 8 Jul.2006)[http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/falun-gong-organ-claim-supported/2006/07/07/1152240489760.html "Falun Gong organ claim supported"],''The Age'', retrieved 7 Jul. 2006</ref> .

===Political freedom===. 
The [[People's Republic of China]] is signatory to the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], but has not ratified it. All citizens of the People's Republic of China who have reached the age of 18 have the right to vote and stand for election, regardless of ethnicity, race, sex, occupation, family background, religious belief, education, property status, or length of residence, except persons deprived of political rights according to law.  . 

In Maoist era China, there was massive [[political repression]]. This is now replaced by selective political repression of small groups of people who openly challenge the CPC's rule; this repression in implemented through the judicial system. <ref>http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=t6Tb1IVqHfgC&pg=PA295&dq=Political+repression+China&hl=en&ei=_CisTaLRDcXTrQfipoynCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=12&ved=0CGUQ6AEwCw#v=onepage&q=Political%20repression%20China&f=false</ref> The most recent mass movement for political freedom was crushed in the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square Massacre]] in 1989, the estimated death toll of which ranges from about 200 to 10,000 depending on sources. <ref>[http://www.89-64.org/html/victims155.htm List of casualties], [[Ding Zilin]], Retrieved 21 May 2007 {{zh icon}}</ref><ref name="TE">Timperlake, Edward. 1999 (1999).

Freedom House rates China as a 6 (second lowest) in political freedoms. The organization characterizes the changes in China in 2011 as such: "With a sensitive change of leadership approaching in 2012 and popular uprisings against authoritarian regimes occurring across the Middle East, the ruling Chinese Communist Party showed no signs of loosening its grip on power in 2011. Despite minor legal improvements regarding the death penalty and urban property confiscation, the government stalled or even reversed previous reforms related to the rule of law, while security forces resorted to extralegal forms of repression. Growing public frustration over corruption and injustice fueled tens of thousands of protests and several large outbursts of online criticism during the year. The party responded by committing more resources to internal security forces and intelligence agencies, engaging in the systematic enforced disappearance of dozens of human rights lawyers and bloggers, and enhancing controls over online social media."<ref>{{cite web|title=Freedom in the World 2012|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2012/china-0|publisher=Freedom House|accessdate=2 April 2012}}</ref> . 

==One-child policy==. 
{{Main|One-child policy}}
[[File:One child policy.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Government sign stating: "For a prosperous, powerful nation and a happy family, please use birth planning."]]
China's [[birth control]] policy, known widely as the [[one-child policy]], was implemented in 1979 by the Chinese government to alleviate the overpopulation problem. Having more than one child is illegal and punishable by fines. [[Voice of America]] cites critics who argue that it contributes to [[Abortion|forced abortions]], human rights violations, female infanticide, abandonment and [[Sex-selective abortion and infanticide|sex-selective abortions]], believed to be relatively commonplace in some areas of the country. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2005-09/2005-09-26-voa6.cfm?CFID=17626358&CFTOKEN=49646296|title=Researchers Urge China to Relax Its One-Child Family Planning Policy|publisher=Voanews|date=26 Sep. 2005}}</ref> This is thought to have been a significant contribution to the gender imbalance in mainland China, where there is a 118:100 ratio of male to female children reported. <ref>{{Cite news|title=Gender imbalance in China could take 15 years to correct|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/jan/24/china.international|accessdate=19 Apr. 2008 | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=24 Jan. 2007 | first1=Ben | last1=Blanchard}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=China grapples with legacy of its ‘missing girls’|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5953508 |accessdate=19 Apr. 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=China vows to halt growing gender imbalance|url= http://english.people.com.cn/200701/23/eng20070123_343739.html|accessdate=19 Apr. 2008}}</ref> Forced abortions and sterilizations have also been reported. <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9806/11/china.abortion/|publisher=CNN |title=China abortion}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/5094395.html|title= Chinese victims of forced late-term abortion fight back|accessdate=30 Aug. 2007 |date= 30 Aug. 2007 |agency=Associated Press|author=Alexa Olesen}}</ref> . 

It is also argued that the one-child policy is not effective enough to justify its costs, and that the dramatic decrease in Chinese fertility started before the program began in 1979 for unrelated factors. The policy seems to have had little impact on rural areas (home to about 80% of the population), where birth rates never dropped below 2.5 children per female. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.overpopulation.com/faq/Population_Control/one_child.html |title=China's One Child Policy|author=Brian Carnell|date= 17 May 2000 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20010516010636/http://www.overpopulation.com/faq/Population_Control/one_child.html |archivedate = 16 May 2001}}</ref><!-- who is Brian Carnell?

In 2002, the laws related to the One-child policy were amended to allow ethnic minorities and Chinese living in rural areas to have more than one child{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}. The policy was generally not enforced in those areas of the country even before this. The policy has been relaxed in urban areas to allow people who have single children to have two children. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/od/populationgeography/a/onechild.htm|title=Geography.about.com population}}</ref> .

The documents told of a massive abuse of psychiatry for political purposes during the leadership of Mao Zedong, during which millions of people had been declared mentally sick. <ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|242}} In the 1980s, according to the official documents, there was political connotation to fifteen percent of all forensic psychiatric cases. <ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|242}} In the early 1990s, the numbers had dropped to five percent, but with beginning of the campaign against [[Falun Gong]], the percentage had again increased quite rapidly. <ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|242}} . 

Chinese official psychiatric literature testifies distinctly that the Communist Party's notion of ‘political dangerousness’ was long since institutionally engrafted in the diagnostic armory of China's psychiatry and included in the main concept of psychiatric dangerousness. <ref name="Munro"/>{{rp|4}} . 

The People’s Republic of China is the only country which appears to abuse psychiatry for political purposes in a systematic way, and despite international criticism, this seems to be continuing. <ref name="van Voren 2010">{{cite journal |author=van Voren R. |title=Political Abuse of Psychiatry—An Historical Overview |journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=33–35 |year=2010 |pmid=19892821 |pmc= 2800147|doi=10.1093/schbul/sbp119  |url=http://www.gip-global.org/images/46/516.pdf}}</ref> Political abuse of psychiatry in the People’s Republic of China is high on the agenda and has produced recurring disputes in the international psychiatric community. <ref name="van Voren 2010"/> The abuses there appear to be even more widespread than in the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s and involve the incarceration of ‘petitioners’, human rights workers, trade union activists, followers of the Falun Gong movement, and people complaining against injustices by local authorities. <ref name="van Voren 2010"/> . 

It also seemed that, China had hardly known high security forensic institutions until 1989. <ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|243}} However, since then, the Chinese authorities have constructed the entire network of special forensic mental hospitals called ''Ankang'' which in Chinese is for ‘Peace and Health.’<ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|243}} By that time, China had had 20 Ankang institutions with the staff employed by the Ministry of State Security. <ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|243}} The psychiatrists who worked there were wearing uniforms under their white coats. <ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|243}} .

In China, the structure of forensic psychiatry was to a great extent identical to that in the USSR. <ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|243}} On its own, it is not so strange, since psychiatrists of the [[Moscow Serbsky Institute]] visited Beijing in 1957 to help their Chinese ‘brethren’, the same psychiatrists who promoted the system of [[political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union]]. <ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|243}} As a consequence, diagnostics were not much different than in the Soviet Union. <ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|244}} The only difference was that the Soviets preferred ‘[[sluggish schizophrenia]]’ as a diagnosis, and the Chinese generally cleaved to the diagnosis ‘[[paranoia]]’ or ‘[[paranoid schizophrenia]]’. <ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|244}} However, the results were the same: long hospitalization in a mental hospital, involuntary treatment with [[neuroleptics]], torture, abuse, all aimed at breaking the victim’s will. <ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|244}} .

The WPA attempted to confine the problem by presenting it as Falun Gong issue and, at the same time, make the impression that the members of the movement were likely not mentally sound, that it was a sect which likely brainwashed its members, etc. <ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|245}} There was even a diagnosis of ‘qigong syndrome’ which was used reflecting on the exercises practiced by Falun Gong. <ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|245}} It was the unfair game aiming to avoid the political abuse of psychiatry from dominating the WPA agenda. <ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|245}} .

==Ethnic minorities==. 
There are 55 [[Nationalities of China|recognized ethnic minorities]] in China. Article 4 of the Chinese constitution states "All nationalities in the People's Republic of China are equal", and the government argues that it has made efforts to improve ethnic education and increased ethnic representation in local government.  . 

Some policies cause [[reverse racism]], where Han Chinese or even ethnic minorities from other regions are treated as second-class citizens in the ethnic region. <ref>{{cite web

Following the [[Chinese economic reform]], businesspeople from other parts of China have traveled to Tibet to do business, although most do not stay in region.

==Economic and property rights==. 
{{Expand section|date=July 2010}}
According to the [[Der Spiegel]] magazine, despite the [[National People's Congress]] enacting a law in 2007 to protect private property with the exception of land, local Chinese authorities have used brutal means to expropriate property, in a bid to profit from the construction boom. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,709691,00.html |title=Der Spiegel: ',Chinese Fight Property Seizures by the State',, August&nbsp;3, 2010 |work=Der Spiegel  |date=28 Jul. 2010 |accessdate=9 May 2011}}</ref> . 

==HIV/AIDS and rights on sexuality==. 
{{See also|HIV/AIDS in the People's Republic of China|Homosexuality in China}} . 

==Other human rights issues==. 
Worker's rights and privacy are other contentious human rights issues in China. There have been several reports of core [[International Labor Organization]] conventions being denied to workers. One such report was released by the [[International Labor Rights Fund]] in October 2006 documenting minimum wage violations, long work hours, and inappropriate actions towards workers by management. <ref>[http://laborrights.org/files/China%20Report%20Press%20Release101206.pdf Wal-Mart in China: Rolling Back Labor Rights] by [http://www.laborrights.org International Labor Rights Fund], October 2006</ref> Workers cannot form their own unions in the workplace, only being able to join State-sanctioned ones.

The issue of refugees from [[North Korea]] is a recurring one. It is official policy to repatriate them to North Korea, but the policy is not evenly enforced and a considerable number of them stay in the People's Republic (some move on to other countries). Though it is in contravention of international law to deport political refugees, as illegal immigrants their situation is precarious. Their rights are not always protected. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/northkorea/norkor1102-01.htm|title=HRW: North Koreans in People's Republic of China}}</ref> Some of them are tricked into marriage or prostitution. <ref>[http://www.antislavery.org/homepage/resources/PDF/Full%20Korea%20report%202005.pdf An Absence of Choice: The sexual exploitation of North Korean women in China] by Norma Kang Muico, Anti-Slavery International 2005. </ref> . 

African students in China have complained about their treatment in China, that was largely ignored until 1988-9, when "students rose up in protest against what they called 'Chinese apartheid'". <ref name=Robinson>Robinson, Thomas W. & Shambaugh, David L. ''Chinese Foreign Policy: Theory and Practice'', Oxford University Press, p. 315. </ref> African officials took notice of the issue, and the [[Organization of African Unity]] issued an official protest. The organization's chairman, [[Mali]]'s president [[Moussa Traoré]], went on a fact-finding mission to China. <ref name=Robinson/> According to a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' 1989 Third World Report titled ''"Chinese apartheid" threatens links with Africa'', these practices could threaten Peking's entire relationship with the continent."<ref name=Snow>Snow, Phillip. "Third World Report: 'Chinese apartheid' threatens links with Africa", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 20 January 1989. </ref> . 

==Counterargument by the PRC government==. 
The [[Government of the People's Republic of China]] has argued that idea of "Asian values"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eko-haus.de/menzius/universal.htm#_ftnref3|title=Confucian claim to universal principles}}</ref> means that the "welfare" of the collective should always be put ahead of the rights of any individual whenever conflicts between these arise. It argues that there is a responsibility of the government to create a "harmonious society",<ref>{{Cite news
|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200506/27/eng20050627_192495.html
|title=Building harmonious society crucial for China's progress: Hu
|work=People's Daily |date=27 Jun. 2005
}}</ref> and that in some cases it is necessary to persuade or force individuals to make sacrifices in their rights for the wider needs of society. It argues that a strong and stable authority is required in order to regulate the potentially conflicting interests of the public and enforce a compromise and that Governments with curtailed authority would fail to take on such a responsibility.  . 

The Chinese government points towards an alleged rapid social deterioration in Western societies, claiming that there has been an increase in geographic, religious and racial segregation; rising crime rates; family breakdown; industrial action; vandalism; and political extremism within Western societies.  They believe these are a direct result of an excess of individual freedom, saying that “Too much freedom is dangerous.”<ref>{{Cite journal

|author=Inoguchi, T. and Newman, E. 
|journal=First Shizuoka Asia-Pacific Forum: the Future of the Asia-Pacific Region
|year=1997}}</ref>
China argues that these actions in Western Nations are all violations of human rights. China believes that these should be taken into account when assessing a country's human right records. Furthermore, the government criticizes the United States, which publishes human rights reports annually, by insisting that the United States has also caused human rights abuses such as the invasion of Iraq. <ref>{{Cite news

The PRC government also argues that the notion of human rights should include economic standards of living and measures of health and economic prosperity. <ref name="xinhuanet human rights" /> On cultural grounds they argue that as the economic, cultural and political situations differ substantially between countries, a universal 'one-size-fits-all' definition of human rights should not apply internationally.  . 

===Reform===. 
In March 2003, an amendment was made to the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]], stating "The State respects and preserves human rights."<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&contentId=A57447-2004Mar14 China Amends Constitution to Guarantee Human Rights] By Edward Cody</ref> In addition, China was dropped from a list of top 10 human rights violators in the annual human rights report released by the U.S. State Department in 2008, while the report indicated that there were still widespread problems in China. <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/12/washington/12rights.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=U.S.+drops+china&st=nyt&oref=slogin8|title=U.S. Drops China From List of top 10 Violators of Rights|publisher=NY Times | first=Helene | last=Cooper | date=12 Mar. 2008 | accessdate=2 Apr. 2010}}</ref> . 

Since 1988, the Chinese government began direct village elections to help maintain social and political order whilst facing rapid economic change. Elections now occur in "about 650,000 villages across China, reaching 75% of the nation's 1.3&nbsp;billion people," according to the Carter Center. <ref>{{cite web
