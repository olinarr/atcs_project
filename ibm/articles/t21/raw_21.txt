The '''one-child policy''' ({{zh|t=計劃生育政策|s=计划生育政策|p=jìhuà shēngyù zhèngcè|l=policy of birth planning}}) is the one-child limitation in the [[population control]] policy of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC). The Chinese government refers to it under the official translation of '''family planning policy'''. <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/celt/eng/zt/zfbps/t125241.htm | title=Family Planning in China | accessdate=27 October 2008 | publisher=Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Lithuania| author=Information Office of the State Council Of the People's Republic of China | date=August 1995}} Section III paragraph 2. </ref> It officially restricts married, urban couples to having only one child, while allowing exemptions for several cases, including rural couples, ethnic minorities, and parents without any siblings themselves. <ref name="steps up">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/941511.stm BBC: China steps up "one-child policy".]</ref> A spokesperson of the Committee on the One-Child Policy has said that approximately 35.9% of China's population is currently subject to the one-child restriction. <ref name=mostpeople>{{cite web | url=http://www2.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-07/11/content_5432238.htm | title=Most people free to have more child | date=7/11/2007 | accessdate = 2009-07-31}}</ref> The [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] are completely exempt from the policy.

The policy is enforced at the provincial level through [[fine (penalty)|fines]] that are imposed based on the income of the family and other factors. Population and Family Planning Commissions ({{zh|c=计划生育委员会|p=Jìhuà Shēngyù Wěiyuánhuì}}) exist at every level of government to raise awareness about the issue and carry out registration and inspection work.

In 2008, China's [[National Population and Family Planning Commission]] said that the policy will remain in place for at least another decade. <ref>"[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/11/world/asia/11china.html China Sticking With One-Child Policy]."

During the period of [[Mao Zedong|Mao Zedong's]] leadership, while the crude birth rate fell from 37 to 20 per thousand <ref name=gg.it>http://www.globalgeografia.it/temi/Population%20Growth%20in%20China.pdf</ref>, infant mortality declined from 227/1000 births in 1949 to 53/1000 in 1981, and life expectancy dramatically increased from around 35 years in 1949 to 65 years in 1976. <ref name=gg.it/><ref>http://www.google.co.nz/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&idim=country:CHN&dl=en&hl=en&q=life+expectancy+china#ctype=l&strail=false&bcs=d&nselm=h&met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&scale_y=lin&ind_y=false&rdim=country&idim=country:CHN&ifdim=country&tstart=-284745600000&tend=220176000000&hl=en&dl=en</ref> The latter two factors resulted in a ballooning of the population from around 540 million in 1949 to 940 million in 1976. <ref>http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010census/2010-08/20/content_11182379.htm</ref> . 

In order to address [[overpopulation]], the one-child policy promotes one-child families and forbids couples from having more than one child in urban areas. Parents with multiple children are not given the same benefits as parents of one child. In most cases, wealthy families pay a fee to the government in order to have a second child or more.  . 

===Current status===. 
The limit has been strongly enforced in urban areas, but the actual implementation varies from location to location. <ref>See [[Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]] report "[http://www.unescap.org/esid/psis/population/database/chinadata/intro.htm Status of Population and Family Planning Program in China by Province]". </ref> In most rural areas, families are allowed to apply to have a second child if the first is a girl,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/2002/Oct/46138.htm | title=Family Planning Law and China's Birth Control Situation | work=[[China Daily]] | author=Hu Huiting | date=18 October 2002 | accessdate=2 March 2009}}</ref> or has a [[Disability|physical disability]], [[mental illness]] or [[mental retardation]]. <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/listseason/11.html | title=Family Planning Law and China's Birth Control Situation | work=[[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]] | author=PBS | date=14 February 1984 | accessdate=13 October 2009}}</ref> Second children are subject to [[birth spacing]] (usually 3 or 4 years). Additional children will result in large fines: families violating the policy are required to pay monetary penalties and might be denied bonuses at their workplace. Children born in overseas countries are not counted under the policy if they do not obtain [[Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China|Chinese citizenship]]. Chinese citizens returning from abroad can have a second child. <ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-12/28/content_770107.htm Are the rich challenging family planning policy?]</ref>[[Image:Danshan Nongguang Village Bulletin board.jpg|thumb|400px|left|The Danshan, Sichuan Province Nongchang Village people Public Affairs Bulletin Board in September 2005 noted that [[Renminbi|RMB]] 25,000 in social compensation fees were owed in 2005. Thus far 11,500 RMB had been collected leaving another 13,500 RMB to be collected.]] . 

As of 2007, 35.9% of the population were subject to a strict one-child limit. 52.9% were permitted to have a second child when the couple's first child is a girl; 9.6% of Chinese couples were permitted two children, regardless of their gender; and 1.6% - mainly [[Tibetan_people|Tibetans]] - had no limit at all. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/china-relaxes-its-one-child-policy/story-e6frg6so-1111112880730 | first=Rowan | last=Callick | title=China relaxes its one-child policy | date=24 January 2007}}</ref> . 

The social fostering or maintenance fee ({{zh|s=社会抚养费|t=社會撫養費|p=shèhuì fǔyǎngfèi|links=no}}) sometimes called in the West a family planning fine, is collected as a fraction of either the annual disposable income of city dwellers or of the annual cash income of peasants, in the year of the child's birth. <ref>[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Sichuan_social_fostering_fee_schedule.jpg#file Summary of Family Planning notice on how FP fines are collected]</ref> The parents also have to pay for both the children to go to school and all the family's health care. Some children who are in one-child families pay less than the children in other families.  . 

The one-child policy was designed from the outset to be a one generation policy. <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=A0-la2vliXwC&lpg=PR7&ots=PpT5UffWSQ&dq=one%20child%20china%20one%20generation&lr&pg=PA179#v=onepage&q=generation&f=false Vanessa L. Fong; Only Hope: Coming of Age Under China's One-Child Policy; Stanford University Press, Feb 15, 2006; Page 179]</ref> . 

The one-child policy is now enforced at the [[province (China)|provincial level]], and enforcement varies; some provinces have relaxed the restrictions. Many provinces and cities, such as [[Henan]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.unescap.org/esid/psis/population/database/poplaws/law_china/ch_record060.htm | date=5 April 2000 | accessdate=29 October 2008 | title=Regulations on Family Planning of Henan Province | publisher=Henan Daily}} Article 13. </ref> and [[Beijing]], permit two "only child" parents to have two children. As early as 1987, official policy granted local officials the flexibility to make exceptions and allow second children in the case of "practical difficulties" (such as cases in which the father is a disabled serviceman) or when both parents are single children,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD81F3BF937A15752C0A961948260 | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=4 January 1987 | accessdate=27 October 2008 | title=America, the U.N. and China's Family Planning (Opinion) | last=Scheuer | first=James}}</ref> and some provinces had other exemptions worked into their policies as well. <ref>Sichuan, for example, has allowed exemptions for couples of certain backgrounds; see Articles 11–13, {{cite web | url=http://www.unescap.org/esid/psis/population/database/poplaws/law_china/ch_record075.htm | date=17 October 1997 | accessdate=31 October 2008 | title=Revised at the 29th session of the standing committee of the 8th People's Congress of Sichuan Province | publisher=[[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]]}}</ref> Following the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]], a new exception to the regulations was announced in [[Sichuan province]] for parents who had lost children in the earthquake. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/27/world/asia/27child.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin One-Child Policy Lifted for Quake Victims’ Parents], by Andrew Jacobs.

Moreover, in accordance with PRC's [[affirmative action]] policies towards [[List of Chinese ethnic groups|ethnic minorities]], all non-[[Han Chinese|Han]] ethnic groups are subjected to different rules and are usually allowed to have two      children in urban areas, and three or four in rural areas.

An advocacy group, composed of academics inside and outside China, has studied the policy since 2001. That group distributed a report in 2004, documenting the policy's effects on age and gender distribution, but government response was not favorable. The group distributed another report in 2009, but the government has stated that the policy will not change until 2015 at the earliest. <ref name="policy outgrown"/> . 

==Effects on population growth and fertility rate==. 
[[File:China Pop Pyramid Forecast.gif|thumb|513px|Progression of China's [[population pyramid]] from [[International Futures]]]]
After the introduction of the one-child policy, the [[Total Fertility Rate|fertility rate]] in China fell from over three births per woman in 1980 (already a sharp reduction from more than five births per woman in the early 1970s) to approximately 1.8 in 2008 and 1.54 in 2011. <ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html#People CIA World Factbook]</ref> . 

The Chinese government estimated that it had three to four hundred million fewer people in 2008 with the one-child policy, than it would have had otherwise. <ref>[http://www.china.org.cn/english/2002/Oct/46138.htm Family Planning Law and China's Birth Control Situation<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="Taylor">{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2005/s1432717.htm |title=China - One Child Policy |accessdate=2008-07-01 |author=John Taylor |date=2005-02-08 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref> Chinese authorities thus consider the policy as a great success in helping to implement China's current economic growth. The reduction in the fertility rate and thus population growth has reduced the severity of problems that come with [[overpopulation]], like epidemics, slums, overwhelmed social services (such as health, education, law enforcement), and strain on the ecosystem from abuse of fertile land and production of high volumes of waste. Even with the one-child policy in place, China still has one million more births than deaths every five weeks.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} . 

==Non-population-related benefits==. 
===Impact on health care=== . 

It is reported that the focus of China on population control helps provide a better health service for women and a reduction in the risks of death and injury associated with pregnancy. At family planning offices, women receive free contraception and pre-natal classes.  . 

===Increased savings rate===. 
The individual savings rate has increased since the one-child policy was introduced. This has been partially attributed to the policy in two respects. First, the average Chinese household expends fewer resources, both in terms of time and money, on children, which gives many Chinese more money with which to invest. Second, since young Chinese can no longer rely on children to care for them in their old age, there is an impetus to save money for the future. <ref>Barry Naughton, ''The Chinese Economy: Transitions and Growth'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2007. </ref> . 

===Economic growth===. 
The original intent of the one-child policy was economic, to reduce the demand of natural resources, maintaining a steady labor rate, reducing [[unemployment]] caused from [[surplus labor]], and reducing the [[rate of exploitation]]. <ref name=chinapop>[http://lpspop.gzlps.gov.cn/art/2008/3/13/art_2338_24378.html 全慰天:社会主义经济规律与中国人口问题] ''[http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=en&prev=/search%3Fq%3D%25E5%2585%25A8%25E6%2585%25B0%25E5%25A4%25A9:%25E7%25A4%25BE%25E4%25BC%259A%25E4%25B8%25BB%25E4%25B9%2589%25E7%25BB%258F%25E6%25B5%258E%25E8%25A7%2584%25E5%25BE%258B%25E4%25B8%258E%25E4%25B8%25AD%25E5%259B%25BD%25E4%25BA%25BA%25E5%258F%25A3%25E9%2597%25AE%25E9%25A2%2598%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dsafari%26rls%3Den%26biw%3D1149%26bih%3D748%26prmd%3Dimvnsb&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=zh-CN&twu=1&u=http://lpspop.gzlps.gov.cn/art/2008/3/13/art_2338_24378.html&usg=ALkJrhh8g_On4uPj2yAWuOd9pMU6oLZh_Q Google Translated Version; Days of full-comfort: the law of the socialist economy with Chinese population]''</ref><ref name="Tian" /> The CPC's justification for this policy was based on their support of [[Mao Zedong]]'s supposedly [[Marxist]] theory of population growth, though Marx was actually witheringly critical of [[Malthusianism]].''<ref name=Tian>{{cite journal |author=Tain Z |title=[Studying Marxist theory on population and initiating a new situation in demographic research] |language=Chinese |journal=Renkou Yanjiu |volume= |issue=2 |pages=13–4 |year=1983 |month=March |pmid=12313010 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Wen TZ |title=Comrade Mao Ze-dong's contribution to Marxist theory on population—in commemoration, of the 60th anniversary of the birth of the Chinese Communist Party |language=Chinese |journal=Renkou Yanjiu |volume= |issue=3 |pages=8–11 |year=1981 |month=July |pmid=12264239 |doi= |url=}}</ref> . 

==Criticisms==. 
===Other available policy alternatives===. 
One type of criticism has come from those who acknowledge the challenges stemming from China's high population growth but believe that less intrusive options, including those that emphasized delay and spacing of births, could have achieved the same results over an extended period of time. Susan Greenhalgh's (2003) review of the policy-making process behind the adoption of the OCPF shows that some of these alternatives were known but not fully considered by China's political leaders. <ref>Susan Greenhalgh. 2003. "Science, Modernity, and the Making of China's One-Child Policy", ''Population and Development Review'' 29 (June): 163–196. </ref> . 

===Policy benefits exaggerated===. 
Another criticism is directed at the exaggerated claimed effects of the policy on the reduction in the [[total fertility rate]]. Studies by Chinese demographers, funded in part by the [[United Nations Population Fund|UN Fund for Population Activities]], showed that combining poverty alleviation and health care with relaxed targets for [[family planning]] was more effective at reducing fertility than vigorous enforcement of very ambitious fertility reduction targets. <ref>[http://beijing.usembassy-china.org.cn/report0698family.html U.S. Embassy Beijing June 1988 report PRC Family Planning: The Market Weakens Controls But Encourages Voluntary Limits]. </ref> In 1988, Zeng Yi and Professor T. Paul Schultz of [[Yale University]] discussed the effect of the transformation to the market on Chinese fertility, arguing that the introduction of the [[Household-responsibility system|contract responsibility system]] in agriculture during the early 1980s weakened family planning controls during that period. <ref>PRC journal ''Social Sciences in China'' [Zhongguo Shehui Kexue, January 1988]. </ref>  Zeng contended that the "big cooking pot" system of the [[People's commune|People's Commune]]s had insulated people from the costs of having many children. By the late 1980s, economic costs and incentives created by the contract system were already reducing the number of children farmers wanted.  . 

As Hasketh, Lu, and Xing observe: "[T]he policy itself is probably only partially responsible for the reduction in the total fertility rate. The most dramatic decrease in the rate actually occurred before the policy was imposed. Between 1970 and 1979, the largely voluntary "late, long, few" policy, which called for later childbearing, greater spacing between children, and fewer children, had already resulted in a halving of the [[total fertility rate]], from 5.9 to 2.9. After the one-child policy was introduced, there was a more gradual fall in the rate until 1995, and it has more or less stabilized at approximately 1.7 since then."<ref name="Hasketh"/> These researchers note further that China could have expected a continued reduction in its fertility rate just from continued economic development, had it kept to the previous policy.  . 

===Human rights===. 
The one-child policy is challenged in principle and in practice for violating a [[human right]] to determine the size of one's own family. A 2001 report exposed that a quota of 20,000 abortions and sterilizations was set for [[List of administrative divisions of Guangdong|Huaiji County]] in [[Guangdong|Guangdong Province]] in one year due to reported disregard of the one-child policy.

Although China has had a reputation for heavy-handed [[eugenics]] policies as part of its population planning policies, the government has backed away from such policies recently, as evidenced by China's ratification of the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], which compels the nation to significantly reform its genetic testing laws. <ref>{{cite news| title = Implications of China's Ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/china/v008/8.1.petersen.html }}</ref> Recent scholarship has also emphasized the necessity of understanding a myriad of complex social relations that affect the meaning of [[informed consent]] in China. <ref>{{cite news| title = Genetic testing, governance, and the family in the People's Republic of China | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6VBF-502GHF4-2/2/13bade432aa67379e5b1494c668ad5bc }}</ref> Furthermore, in 2003, China revised its marriage registration regulations and couples no longer have to submit to a pre-marital physical or genetic examination before being granted a marriage license. <ref>{{cite news| title = Marriage Law of the People’s Republic of China | url = http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/4b6fe19d6.pdf }}</ref> .

===The "four-two-one" problem=== . 

As the first generation of law-enforced only children came of age for becoming parents themselves, one adult child was left with having to provide support for his or her two parents and four grandparents. <ref name="luzaihefang">{{cite news | title="四二一"家庭，路在何方？('Four-two-one families', where is the road going? | date=5 April 2008 | accessdate=31 January 2011 | author=李雯 (Li Wen) | url=http://www.yndaily.com/html/20080405/news_99_16443.html | publisher=云南日报网 (Yunnan Daily Online) | language=Chinese}}</ref><ref name="renkouxuehui">{{cite web | title="四二一"家庭真的是问题吗？(Are 'four-two-one' families really a problem?) | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110707050058/http://cpachn.org.cn/ShowNews.asp?ID=1021 | publisher=中国人口学会网 (China Population Association Online) | date=10 October 2010 | accessdate=31 January 2011 | language=Chinese}}</ref> Called the "4-2-1 Problem", this leaves the older generations with increased chances of dependency on retirement funds or charity in order to receive support.

If, for any reason, the single child is unable to care for their older adult relatives, the oldest generations would face a lack of resources and necessities. In response to such an issue, certain provinces maintained that couples were allowed to have two children if both parents were only children themselves.

===Possible social problems for a generation of only children===. 
Some parents may over-indulge their only child. The media referred to the indulged children in one-child families as "[[little emperor]]s". Since the 1990s, some people have worried that this will result in a higher tendency toward poor social communication and cooperation skills among the new generation, as they have no siblings at home. No social studies have investigated the ratio of these over-indulged children and to what extent they are indulged. With the first generation of children born under the policy (which initially became a requirement for most couples with first children born starting in 1979 and extending into 1980s) reaching adulthood, such worries were reduced. <ref>{{Cite document|title=The Little Emperors|publisher=Los Angeles Times|author=Daniela Deane|date=July 26, 1992|pages=16|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> However, the "little emperor syndrome" and additional expressions, describing the generation of Chinese singletons are very abundant in the Chinese media, Chinese academy and popular discussions. Being over-indulged, lacking self discipline and having no adaptive capabilities are adjectives which are highly associated with Chinese singletons,<ref>[http://thinkingchinese.com/index.php?page_id=117%20 Chinese Singletons - Basic ‘Spoiled’ Related Vocabulary],[http://thinkingchinese.com Thinking Chinese], November 11, 2010. </ref>
Some 30 delegates called on the government in the [[Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference]] (CPPCC) in March 2007 to abolish the one-child rule, attributing their beliefs to "social problems and personality disorders in young people". One statement read, "It is not healthy for children to play only with their parents and be spoiled by them: it is not right to limit the number to two children per family, either."<ref name=CPPCC/> The proposal was prepared by Ye Tingfang, a professor at the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]], who suggested that the government at least restore the previous rule that allowed couples to have up to two children. According to a scholar, "The one-child limit is too extreme. It violates nature’s law. And in the long run, this will lead to mother nature’s revenge."<ref name=CPPCC>{{cite news| title = Consultative Conference: "The government must end the one-child rule" | publisher = AsiaNews.it |date=2007-03-16 |  url =http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&art=8757&size=A}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Advisors say it's time to change one-child policy | publisher = Shanghai Daily |date=2007-03-15 | url = http://english.sina.com/china/1/2007/0315/106515.html}}</ref> . 

===Unequal enforcement===. 
Government officials and especially wealthy individuals have often been able to violate the policy in spite of fines. <ref name="Chinanews"/>  For example, between 2000 and 2005, as many as 1,968 officials in central China's [[Hunan]] province were found to be violating the policy, according to the provincial family planning commission; also exposed by the commission were 21 national and local lawmakers, 24 political advisors, 112 entrepreneurs and 6 senior intellectuals. <ref name="Chinanews">{{cite web | work=[[Xinhua]] | url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-07/08/content_912620.htm | title=Over 1,900 officials breach birth policy in C.

===Circumvention through "birth tourism"===. 
A way to escape the strict rules of the one-child policy is for Chinese women to give birth to their second child overseas. A favourite destination was Hong Kong. Hong Kong is exempt from the one-child policy and the Hong Kong passport, which is different from a China mainland passport, provides additional advantages. Recently though, the Hong Kong government has drastically reduced the quota of births set for non-local women in public hospitals. As a result fees for delivering babies there have surged. As further admission cuts or a total ban on non-local births in Hong Kong are being considered, mainland agencies that arrange for expectant mothers to give birth overseas are predicting a surge in those going to North America. <ref>http://www.review33.com/m/forum_msg.php?db=3&tstart=0&s=&topic=90120131205753&number=5</ref> As the US practices birthright citizenship children born in the US will be US citizens. The closest option (from China) is [[Saipan]] in the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], a US dependency in the western Pacific Ocean that allows Chinese visitors without visa restrictions. The island is currently experiencing an upswing in Chinese births. This option is used by relatively affluent Chinese who often have secondary motives as well, wishing their children to be able to leave communist China when they grow older or bring their parents to the U.S..  Canada is less popular as Ottawa denies many visa requests. <ref>Birth tourism on the upswing.

==Effects on female population==. 
[[Image:Guanyin Who Sends Children -- Danshan Sichuan temple.jpg#file|thumb|250px|"The Guanyin Who Sends Children" in a temple in the small town of [[Danshan]], [[Sichuan]]. ]]
China, like many other Asian countries, has a long tradition of [[son preference]]. <ref name="Taylor" />  The commonly accepted explanation for son preference is that sons in rural families may be thought to be more helpful in farm work. Both rural and urban populations have economic and traditional incentives, including widespread remnants of [[Confucianism]], to prefer sons over daughters. Sons are preferred as they provide the primary financial support for the parents in their retirement, and a son's parents typically are better cared for than his wife's. In addition, Chinese traditionally hold that daughters, on their marriage, become primarily part of the groom's family. Male-to-female sex ratios in the current Chinese population are high in both rural and urban areas. <ref name="Hasketh">Therese Hasketh, Li Lu, and Zhu Wei Xing. 2005.

The [[human sex ratio|sex ratio]] at birth (between male and female births) in [[mainland China]] reached 117:100 in the year 2000, substantially higher than the natural baseline, which ranges between 103:100 and 107:100. It had risen from 108:100 in 1981—at the boundary of the natural baseline—to 111:100 in 1990. <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cicred.org/Eng/Seminars/Details/Seminars/FDA/papers/18_ChenWei.pdf<!-- | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060718153354/http://www.cicred.org/Eng/Seminars/FDA/papers/18_ChenWei.pdf | archivedate=18 July 2006--> | author=Chen Wei | title=Sex Ratios at Birth in China | year=2005 | accessdate=2 March 2009}} {{Verify credibility|date=March 2009}}</ref> According to a report by the [[National Population and Family Planning Commission]], there will be 30 million more men than women in 2020, potentially leading to social instability, and courtship-motivated [[emigration]]. <ref>{{cite news

Other Asian regions also have higher than average ratios, including [[Taiwan]] (110:100) and [[South Korea]] (108:100), which do not have a family planning policy<ref>See the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] report [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2018.html Sex ratio]. </ref> and the ratio in South Korea was as high as 116:100 in the early 1990s but since then has moved substantially back toward a normal range, with a ratio of 107:100 in 2005. <ref>"Where Boys Were Kings, a Shift Toward Baby Girls,"[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/world/asia/23skorea.html New York Times, December 24, 2007]. </ref> Many studies have explored the reason for the gender-based birth rate disparity in China as well as other countries. A study in 1990 attributed the high preponderance of reported male births in mainland China to four main causes: diseases which affect females more severely than males; the result of widespread underreporting of female births; the illegal practice of [[sex-selective abortion]] made possible by the widespread availability of [[obstetric ultrasonography|ultrasound]]; and finally, acts of child abandonment and infanticide. <ref name="abortions"/> The number of bachelors in China had already increased between 1990 and 2005, implying that China's lack of brides is not solely linked to the one-child policy, as single-child families were only enforced from 1979. <ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15636231 "The worldwide war on baby girls"].

In a recent paper, Emily Oster (2005) proposed a biological explanation for the gender imbalance in Asian countries, including China.

Monica Das Gupta (2005) has shown that "whether or not females 'go missing' is determined by the existing sex composition of the family into which they are conceived. Girls with no older sisters have similar chances of survival as boys. Girls conceived in families that already have a daughter, experience steeply higher probabilities of being aborted or of dying in early childhood. Gupta claims that cultural factors provide the overwhelming explanation for the "missing" females."<ref>Monica Das Gupta, [http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/stuff_for_blog/gupta.pdf "Explaining Asia's 'Missing Women'"], ''Population and Development Review'' 31 (September 2005): 529–535. </ref> . 

The disparity in the sex ratio at birth increases dramatically after the first birth, for which the ratios remained steadily within the natural baseline over the 20 year interval between 1980 and 1999. Thus, a large majority of couples appear to accept the outcome of the first pregnancy, whether it is a boy or a girl. If the first child is a girl, and they are able to have a second child, then a couple may take extraordinary steps to assure that the second child is a boy. If a couple already has two or more boys, the sex ratio of higher parity births swings decidedly in a feminine direction. <ref>This tendency to favour girls in high parity births to couples who had already borne sons was also noted by Coale, who suggested as well that once a couple had achieved its goal for the number of males, it was also much more likely to engage in "stopping behavior", i.e., to stop having more children. See [[Ansley J. Coale]] (1996), [http://www.jstor.org/stable/987286 "Five Decades of Missing Females in China"], ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 140 (4): 421–450. </ref> . 

This demographic evidence indicates that while families highly value having male offspring, a secondary norm of having a girl or having some balance in the sexes of children often comes into play. For example, Zeng et al. (1993) reported a study based on the 1990 census in which they found sex ratios of just 65 or 70 boys per 100 girls for births in families that already had two or more boys. <ref>Zeng Yi et al. 1993.

A section written by [[East China Normal University]] demography professor Ci Qinying, "Research on the Sex Ratio at Birth Should Take a Gender Discrimination Approach," argued that researchers must pay closer attention to gender issues in demography,<ref>"[http://www.usc.cuhk.edu.hk/wk_wzdetails.asp?id=5532 China’s Sex Ratio at Birth: From Doubts About its Existence to Looking for a Solution]." ''Population Research'' 1/2006 issue　原载《人口研究》2006年第1期. <br/>"If we do pay more attention to the problem of the rising sex ratio, still the focus is on the rights of males such as the right to marry, and ignores women’s rights such as the right to survive, the right to reproduce, the right to health, etc. This approach inflicts even more harm on women. If this approach is taken, women will never be able to escape their subsidiary position and their role of satisfying the desires of others. Robbing females of their right to exist [shengmingquan 生命权] is for the sake of giving birth to males – that is putting the right to survive of males first. Moreover, protecting women’s right to exist is merely for the purpose of provide a wife to sons. A measure to ensure that a counterpart is available to ensure that male can exercise his right to marry. In both case, the male is primary and the female is subsidiary."</ref><ref>"[http://web.archive.org/web/20080405220051/http://www.usc.cuhk.edu.hk/wk_wzdetails.asp?id=5532 China’s Sex Ratio at Birth: From Doubts About its Existence to Looking for a Solution]."

The authors of another review article, "Girl Survival in China: History, Present Situation and Prospects," which was presented at a 2005 conference supported by the [[United Nations Fund for Population Activities]] (UNFPA), concluded that "The Chinese government has already set the goal of achieving a normal gender ratio at birth by 2010, and to achieve preliminary results in establishing a new cultural outlook on marriage and having children.

===Abandoned or orphaned children and adoption===. 
[[Image:PRC family planning don't abandon girls.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Rural [[Sichuan]] roadside sign: "It is forbidden to discriminate against, mistreat or abandon baby girls."]]  The social pressure exerted by the one-child policy has affected the rate at which parents abandon undesirable children, and many live in state-sponsored orphanages, from which thousands are adopted internationally and by Chinese parents each year. In the 1980s and early 1990s, poor care and high mortality rates in some state institutions generated intense international pressure for reform. <ref>See [[Human Rights Watch]] report "A Policy of Fatal Neglect in China’s State Orphanages" {{Citation

}} and [http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/china96.pdf CHINESE ORPHANAGES A Follow-up]. </ref> . 

According to Sten Johansson and Ola Nygren (1991) adoptions accounted for half of the so-called "missing girls" in the 1980s in the PRC. <ref>Sten Johansson and Ola Nygren. 1991. "[http://www.jstor.org/stable/1972351 The Missing Girls of China: A New Demographic Account]", ''Population and Development Review'' 17 (March): 35–51. </ref>  Through the 1980s, as the one-child policy came into force, parents who desired a son but bore a daughter in some cases failed to report or delayed the reporting of the birth of the girl to the authorities. But rather than neglecting or abandoning unwanted girls, the parents may have offered them up for formal or informal adoption. A majority of children who went through formal adoption in China in the later 1980s were girls, and the proportion who were girls increased over time (Johansson and Nygren 1991).  . 

The practice of adopting out unwanted girls is consistent with both the son preference of many Chinese couples and the findings of Zeng et al. (1993) and Anderson and Silver (1995) that under some circumstances families have a preference for girls, in particular when they have already satisfied their goals for sons. Research by Weiguo Zhang (2006) on child adoption in rural China reveals increasing receptivity to adopting girls, including by infertile and childless couples. <ref>Weiguo Zhang. 2006. [http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/~w3zhang/Zhang%20JFI%20adoption.pdf "Child Adoption in Contemporary Rural China"], ''Journal of Family Issues'' 27 (March): 301–340. </ref> . 

In 1992, China instituted its first Adoption Law. Officially registered adoptions increased from about 2,000 in 1992 to 55,000 in 2001. According to one scholar, these figures "represent a small proportion of adoptions in China because many adopted children were adopted informally without official registrations. International adoption rates climbed dramatically after the early 1990s, increasing to the U.S. alone from about 200 in 1992 to more than 7,900 in 2005. <ref>U.S. State Department report, "Immigrant Visas Issued to Orphans Coming to the U.S.", at http://travel.state.gov/family/adoption/stats/stats_451.html. </ref> . 

According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', many babies put up for adoption had not been abandoned by their parents, but confiscated by family planning officials. <ref>{{cite news|author=Demick, Barbara|title=Chinese Babies Stolen by Officials for Foreign Adoptions|work=Los Angeles Times|date=20 Sept. 2009|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-china-adopt20-2009sep20,0,491086.story}}</ref> . 

===Infanticide===. 
Gender-selected abortion, abandonment, and [[infanticide]] are illegal in China. Nevertheless, the [[US State Department]],<ref>See Associated Press article [http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/27-12142004-416868.html US State Department position]. </ref> the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]],<ref>See publication of the United Kingdom Parliament position [http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/vo961218/text/61218-08.htm regarding Human Rights in China and Tibet]. </ref> and the [[human rights]] organization [[Amnesty International]]<ref>See Amnesty International's report on [http://www.amnesty.ie/content/view/full/1683/ violence against women in China]. </ref> have all declared that China's family planning programs contribute to infanticide.  . 

Anthropologist G. William Skinner at the University of California–Davis and Chinese researcher Yuan Jianhua have claimed that infanticide was fairly common in China before the 1990s. <ref>{{Cite news|publisher=San Jose Mercury News (California)|date=2000-03-15|title=Experts Allege Infanticide In China 'Missing' Girls Killed, Abandoned, Pair Say|author=Sarah Lubman}}</ref> . 

==Fertility medicines==. 
A 2006 ''[[China Daily]]'' report stated that wealthy couples are increasingly turning to fertility medicines to have [[multiple birth]]s, because of the lack of penalties against couples who have more than one child in their first birth. According to the report, the number of multiple births per year in China had doubled by 2006. <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2006-02/14/content_520025.htm | title=China: Drug bid to beat child ban | work=[[China Daily]] | accessdate=11 November 2008 | date=14 February 2006 | author=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> .
