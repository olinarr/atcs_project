The '''Iron Fist Campaign''' was a [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] program conducted in the summer of 2010 by family planning officials in [[Puning]], a county in [[Guangdong]], [[People's Republic of China|China]]. <ref name="MarieClaire">{{cite news | title = Breaking China's One-Child Law | author = Haworth, Abigail | pages = 136&ndash;139 | date = December 2010 | volume = 17 | issue = 12 | publisher = Marie Claire | url = http://www.marieclaire.com/world-reports/news/latest/chinas-one-child-law }}</ref> . 

== Background ==. 
{{Main|One-child policy}}
In 1978, the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] introduced the [[one-child policy]], which legally prevents couples from having more than one child, though there are some exemptions. The policy was created to address the country's overpopulation issue and economic problems.  . 

By 2010, family planning efforts in [[Puning]] had diminished due to rapid economic growth in the area, as [[Guangdong]] had become the most successful manufacturing region in the [[People's Republic of China]]. <ref name="MarieClaire"/> However, local family planning officials were pressured to reduce births to meet the nationwide quotas. Chen Hong-Ping, the regional Communist Party chief, launched the Iron Fist Campaign in order to meet these demands. <ref name="MarieClaire"/> . 

== Campaign ==. 
In April 2010, a task force of approximately 600 local officials<ref name="MarieClaire"/> targeted 9,559 women who had violated the country's one-child policy. <ref name="Telegraph">{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/7599440/Chinese-officials-launch-campaign-to-sterilise-10000.html | title = Chinese officials launch campaign to sterilise 10,000 | date = 16 April 2010 | publisher = Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> The women were required to report to government clinics to undergo [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]]. <ref name="MarieClaire"/> Family members of those women who had refused sterilization were detained indefinitely until the women complied with the procedure. <ref name="Sky">{{cite news | title = China To Sterilise 10,000 To Curb Births | url = http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/China-Authorities-Plan-To-Sterilise-10000-People-To-Ensure-They-Meet-Family-Planning-Targets/Article/201004415613125? | publisher = Sky News | author = Sharp, Peter | date = 23 April 2010 }}</ref> In some cases, the women themselves were detained. <ref name="Independent">{{cite news | title = Chinese state holds parents hostage in sterilisation drive | author = Bland, Archie | date = 17 April 2010 | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/chinese-state-holds-parents-hostage-in-sterilisation-drive-1947236.html | publisher = Independent}}</ref> Over the course of the 20-day campaign, 1,377 people were detained. <ref name="Independent"/> From April to June, over 9,000 women were reported to have been sterilized as a result of the campaign. <ref name="MarieClaire"/> . 

== Criticism ==. 
News of the campaign did not make major headlines outside of local newspapers. He Yafu, an independent expert on family planning in China, suggested that the central government made an effort to conceal the results of the campaign because Chinese law specifically prohibited the means used to enforce it. <ref name="MarieClaire"/> Provincial officials have reported that the local Puning authorities will be investigated to determine the legality of their actions. <ref name="Independent"/> [[Kate Allen (Amnesty International)|Kate Allen]] of [[Amnesty International]] described the campaign as "appalling" and voiced her opinion that "authorities must condemn this practice immediately". <ref name="Sky"/>  .
