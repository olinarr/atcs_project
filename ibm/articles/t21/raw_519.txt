Since 1949, the government of [[People's Republic of China]] has actively promoted the social, economic and political roles of women in society. While advancing progress in promoting [[gender equality|equality among men and women]], the efforts met resistance in a traditionally [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] society of male superiority.  . 

==Progress in promoting equality==. 
"In 1949, when the PRC was founded, employed women accounted for only 7 percent of the workforce; in 1992, however, the figure was 38 percent.  Women's contribution to family income went from 20 percent in the 1950s to 40 percent in the 1990s.  In 1982, Chinese working women made up 43 percent of the total population, higher than the percentages enjoyed by American women (35.3 percent) or Japanese women (36 percent)."

==Gender inequality==. 
===Domestic life===. 
====Marriage and family planning ====. 
Continuation of one’s family line is important in the traditional Chinese marriage system. The parents of the soon-to-be groom and bride arrange the marriage with an emphasis on the alliance between the two families. <ref name="Tamney4">Tamney, J. B., & Chiang, L.H. (2002). ''Modernization, Globalization, and Confucianism in Chinese Societies.''

Following the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, the [[New Marriage Law|Marriage Law of 1950]] was enacted. <ref name="China Today">China Today. (2001).

The bride price custom has transformed into providing gifts for the bride or her family. <ref name="engel"/>
=====Second wives=====. 
The phenomenon of de facto [[polygamy]], or so-called "second wives" (二奶 èrnǎi in Chinese), has reemerged in recent years. <ref>{{cite journal

=====Policies on divorce=====. 
Prior to the creation of the [[New Marriage Law|Marriage Law of 1950]], there were three commonly used methods to dissolve a marriage: [[no-fault divorce]], state mandated marriage annulment, and independent divorce at the discretion of the husband. <ref name "think">[http://thinkingchinese.com/index.php?page_id=128 Romantic Materialism (the development of the marriage institution and related norms in China)], [http://thinkingchinese.com Thinking Chinese], October 2012</ref> The [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-906 CE) recognized that a marriage filled with incompatibility could be dissolved with approval from the husband. This type of divorce is classified as a no-fault divorce, whereas a state mandated marriage annulment is only applicable when a serious offense has been committed on the spouse or his or her family. If the husband’s decision to dissolve the marriage satisfied one of seven specified reasons, then it was deemed an independent divorce and was legally recognized. <ref name "think">[http://thinkingchinese.com/index.php?page_id=128 Romantic Materialism (the development of the marriage institution and related norms in China)], [http://thinkingchinese.com Thinking Chinese], October 2012</ref> Typically the decision to divorce was at the discretion of the husband not the wife. <ref name "think"/> . 

The Marriage Law, which legalized divorces for both men and women, resulted in an increase in divorce rates. As women began divorcing their husbands, tensions increased and much resistance was met from rural males. Although divorce was now legally recognized, thousands of women lost their lives for attempting to divorce their husbands and some committed suicide when the right to divorce was withheld. <ref name="kay"> Kay Ann Johnson, Women, the Family, and Peasant Revolution in China http://www.press.uchicago.edu/presssite/metadata.epl?mode=toc&bookkey=76671 (accessed on 20, February 2012)</ref> Divorce, once seen as a rare act during the [[Mao Zedong|Mao era]] (1949-1976), has become more common with rates continuing to increase today. <ref>USC US-China Institute, "Divorce is increasingly common" http://www.china.usc.edu/ShowAverageDay.aspx?articleID=592 (accessed 26 February 2012)</ref> The Marriage Law was amended in 2003 to reflect more reasons for divorce and to shorten the application process. The new law now recognizes infidelity as a justification for divorce. <ref name "think">[http://thinkingchinese.com/index.php?page_id=128 Romantic Materialism (the development of the marriage institution and related norms in China)], [http://thinkingchinese.com Thinking Chinese], October 2012</ref> . 

====Spousal abuse====. 
The lack of public awareness of the Marriage Law of 2005, which prohibits [[domestic violence]], has allowed spousal abuse to persist. In 2004 the [[All-China Women’s Federation]] compiled survey results to show that thirty percent of the women in China experienced domestic violence within their homes. <ref>U.S. Department of State. “Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 2006: China, (2007)”. http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78771.htm (accessed on February 16, 2012).[http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78771.htm]</ref> An significant increase in the prevalence of domestic violence in the People's Republic of China involving Chinese women committing violence against Chinese men. In 2003, 10 percent of violence in families involved male victims. The wives beat their husbands, and some cut off their penises. In [[Wuxi]] in [[Jiangsu]] province a man had his penis cut off by his wife. <ref>{{cite news |title=Survey says 10% of family violence victims are men|author=|url=http://www2.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-09/03/content_260857.htm|newspaper=China Daily HK Edition|date=2003-09-03<!-- 10:58-->|page=|accessdate=December 26, 2010}}</ref> . 

====Foot binding====. 
[[Foot binding]] was conceptualized as early as the 6th century, but did not become popular until the 13th century. The process of bending a woman’s feet, breaking the arches, and wrapping the toes against the feet is the ancient traditional of foot binding, which has since been outlawed. <ref name="foot binding"/> Foot binding was performed to create smaller looking feet with intense arches. <ref name="foot binding"/> Society viewed these smaller feet as attractive. Special shoes were created to highlight the beauty of the bound foot size. <ref name="foot binding"/> The practice soon became a cultural norm and a requirement for [[Marriage in the People's Republic of China| marriage]] as mothers bound the feet of their daughters. <ref name="foot binding"/> Although the feet were seen as beautiful, the process of foot binding was painful and left many women immobile, confining them to their homes. <ref name="foot binding"/> Bound feet became the mark of women in high class because few lower class women had the opportunity to bind their feet due to the dependence on normal walking to complete house work. <ref name="foot binding"/> Foot binding has since been outlawed multiple times. In 1949 the practice of foot binding was finally banned. <ref name="foot binding">{{cite journal|last=Blake|first=C.

===Education===. 
{{main| History of education in China}}
{{main| Education in the People's Republic of China}}
The gender gap in current enrollment widens with age because males are more likely to be enrolled than females at every age group in the People's Republic of China. <ref name= "Bauer"/> 1961 marked the sudden decrease in female enrollment in primary and secondary school. Female primary school enrollment suffered more then that of males during the [[Great Chinese Famine]] (1958-1961). <ref name= "Bauer"/> Although the gender gap for secondary and primary education has narrowed over time, the gender gap at the highest education level remains much larger. <ref name="Bauer"/> The One Percent Population Survey in 1987 found that in rural areas 48 percent of males aged 45 and above were [[Literacy| illiterate]] while 6 percent of males 15-19 years old were illiterate. Although the percentage of illiterate women decreased significantly 88 percent to 15 percent, it is still significantly higher than the percentage of illiterate men for the same age groupings. <ref name= "Bauer"/> . 

Education is instrumental for the empowerment of women and children. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Banerjee|first=Abhijit V|coauthors=Esther Duflo|title=Top of the Class|journal=Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty|year=2011|pages=71–102; 282–285}}</ref> Education, which is typically granted to adolescent boys instead of young girls, contributes to women’s overall subordinate position. <ref name="Bauer">{{cite journal|last=Bauer|first=John|coauthors=Wang Feng, Nancy E.

===Health care===. 
In traditional Chinese culture, which was based on Confucius ideologies in a patriarchal society, women did not possess priority in healthcare. Males were viewed as superior and as a result healthcare was tailored to focus on them. <ref name="hong">Hong, Lawrence K. "The Role of Women in the People's Republic of China: Legacy and Change." Social problems 23.5 (1976): 545-57.[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0037-7791%28197606%2923%3A5%3C545%3ATROWIT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-P] (accessed 8 February 2012)</ref> Chinese healthcare has since undergone much reform and has tried to provide Chinese women equal healthcare as men. The [[China|People’s Republic of China]] began to shift their focus onto the enforcement of healthcare for women. This change was apparent, when the women in the Chinese workforce were granted health care. Healthcare policy required all women workers to receive urinalysis and vaginal examinations yearly. <ref name= "hong"/> The People's Republic of China has enacted various laws to protect the healthcare rights of women, including the Maternal and Child Care law. This law and numerous others focused on protecting the rights of all women in the People's Republic of China.  . 

Gender discrimination has contributed to the [[Missing women of Asia|millions of missing women of China]]. <ref>Yu MY, Sarri R. Women's health status and gender inequality in China.

====Population control====. 
=====One-child policy=====. 
{{Main|One-child Policy}}
In 1956, the Chinese government publicly announced its goal to control the exponentially increasing population size. The government planned to use education and publicity as their main modes of increasing awareness. <ref>Chen, C. C., and Frederica M. Bunge. Medicine in Rural China : A Personal Account. Berkeley:  University of California Press, 1989. </ref> [[Zhou Enlai]] launched the first program for smaller families under the guidance of Madame Li Teh-chuan, the [[Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China| Minister of Health]] at the time. During this time, family planning and contraceptive usage were highly publicized and encouraged. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Jiali|first=Li|title=China's One-Child Policy: How and How Well Has it Worked?

Berkeley:  University of California Press, 1989. </ref>  . 

Mainland China has a highly masculine sex ratio.  The [[human sex ratio|sex ratio]] at birth (between male and female births) in [[mainland China]] reached 117:100 in the year 2000, substantially more masculine than the natural baseline, which ranges between 103:100 and 107:100. It had risen from 108:100 in 1981—at the boundary of the natural baseline—to 111:100 in 1990. <ref>http://www.cicred.org/Eng/Seminars/FDA/papers/18_ChenWei.pdf{{Dead link|date=March 2008}}</ref> According to a report by the State Population and Family Planning Commission, there will be 30 million more men than women in 2020, potentially leading to social instability. <ref>{{cite news

  | accessdate =  2007-01-12}}</ref> The correlation between the increase of masculine [[sex ratio]] disparity on birth and the deployment of one child policy would appear to have been caused by the one-child policy.  . 

However, other Asian regions also have higher than average ratios, including [[Taiwan]] (110:100) , which does not have a family planning policy. <ref>See the [[Central Intelligence Agency|C.I.A.]] report [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2018.html Sex ratio]. The ratio in South Korea reached as high as 116:100 in the early 1990s but since then has moved substantially back toward a normal range, with a ratio of 107:100 in 2005. See "Where Boys Were Kings, a Shift Toward Baby Girls," [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/world/asia/23skorea.html New York Times, December 24, 2007]. </ref>  Many studies have explored the reason for the gender-based birthrate disparity in China as well as other countries. A study in 1990 attributed the high preponderance of reported male births in mainland China to four main causes: diseases which affect females more severely than males; the result of widespread under-reporting of female births;<ref>For a study in China that revealed under-reporting or delayed reporting of female births, see M. G. Merli and A. E. Raftery. 1990. "Are births under-reported in rural China?

=====Iron fist campaign=====. 
When the focus on family planning decreased in [[Puning]], a city in the southern province of Guangdong, executive family planning officials mandated a reduction in Puning’s birthrates to satisfy national allowances. <ref name="Sky">{{cite news | title = China To Sterilise 10,000 To Curb Births | url = http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/China-Authorities-Plan-To-Sterilise-10000-People-To-Ensure-They-Meet-Family-Planning-Targets/Article/201004415613125? | publisher = Sky News | author = Sharp, Peter | date = 23 April 2010 }}</ref>  In 2010, the Puning officials on family planning held the [[Iron Fist Campaign]].

===Employment===. 
Gender inequalities in China extend outside of the home and into the labor force. Even though women in China are actively contributing to the paid labor force at an extent that exceeds numerous other countries, equality in the workforce has yet to be reached. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Knight|first=J|coauthors=L.

====Rural work====. 
In traditional China, land was passed down from father to son and in the case of no son, the land was then given to a close male relative. <ref name="matthews">Matthews, Rebecca and Victor Nee.

====Urban and migrant work====. 
In the private sector, Chinese law mandates the coverage of maternity leave and costs of childbirth. These maternity laws have led to employers’ reluctance to hire women. <ref>Tatlow, Didi Kirsten. [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/26/world/asia/26iht-china.html?partner=rss&emc=rss "For China’s Women, More Opportunities, More Pitfalls."] ''[[nytimes.com]]'', 25 November 2010 (accessed 22 February 2012)</ref> .

Increasing urban wage inequality in China. Economics of Transition, Vol. 11, (2003): 597–619. </ref> . 

In 1984 the reform of the Regulations of Permanent Residence Registration marked an increase in the migration of rural Chinese workers. As the restrictions on residence became more lenient, less penalizing, and permitted people to travel to find employment, more women engaged in migrant labor. <ref name="Female Migrant"/> In the cities, women could find low paying work as factory workers. These increased employment opportunities drew women out of rural areas in hopes of escaping poverty. <ref name="Female Migrant"/> Although this reformed system enabled the migration of rural residents, it prohibited them from accepting any benefits in the cities or changing their permanent residence, which led to a majority of [[migrant worker|migrant workers]] not receiving any forms of medical care, education, or housing. <ref name="Female Migrant"/>  Currently 90 percent of migrant workers violate the Chinese labour law by working without contracts. <ref name="Female Migrant"/>  . 

Women migrant workers outnumber males 2:1. <ref name="Female Migrant"/>  80 percent of the migrant workers were women in the Nanshan district of Shenzhen.  The [[Shenzhen Special Economic Zone]] in 2003 employed 5.5 million migrant workers with 70 percent of the workers being female. <ref name="Female Migrant"/>  
A preference for younger women over older women, has led to a predominantly young population of migrant workers.[31] Married women have more restrictions on mobility due to duties to the family, whereas younger women are more likely to not be married. Also, younger rural women are less likely to become pregnant, possess nimble fingers, more able to work longer hours, and are less knowledgeable about their statutory rights. <ref name="Female Migrant"/>  For the women who are able to gain employment, they then face the possibility of being forced to sign a contract prohibiting them from getting pregnant or married during their period of employment. <ref>Cooke, Fang.

===Women in politics===. 
Women in China have low participation rates as political leaders. Women’s disadvantage is most evident in
