'''Overpopulation''' is a generally undesirable condition where an [[organism]]'s numbers exceed the [[carrying capacity]] of its [[habitat]]. The term often refers to the relationship between the [[world population|human population]] and its [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], the Earth,<ref>"[http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/aug/31/climatechange.food Global food crisis looms as climate change and population growth strip fertile land]". Guardian.co.uk. 31 August 2007. </ref> or smaller geographical areas such as countries. Overpopulation can result from an increase in [[List of countries and territories by fertility rate|births]], a decline in [[mortality rate]]s, an increase in immigration, or an [[Sustainability|unsustainable]] [[biome]] and depletion of resources. It is possible for very sparsely populated areas to be overpopulated if the area has a meager or non-existent capability to sustain life (e.g. a [[desert]]).  . 

The population has been growing continuously since the end of the [[Black Death]], around the year 1400,{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} although the most significant increase has been in the last 50 years, mainly due to [[History of medicine#Modern medicine|medical advancements]] and increases in agricultural productivity. Although the rate of population growth has been declining since the 1980s, the United Nations has expressed concern on continued excessive population growth in sub-Saharan Africa. <ref name="bbc.co.uk">{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-15459643 |title=BBC News – Population seven billion: UN sets out challenges |publisher=BBC  |date=26 October 2011 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref> As of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}} the world human population is estimated to be {{Formatnum:{{#expr: {{worldpop}} / 10^9 round 3}}}}&nbsp;[[1000000000 (number)|billion]] by the [[United States Census Bureau]],<ref name=USCBcite>{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/population/popclockworld.html |title=U.S. Census Bureau – World POPClock Projection|accessdate=2011-10-27}}</ref> and over 7 billion by the [[United Nations]]. <ref name=UN7bn>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-15459643 |title=Population seven billion: UN sets out challenges|date=2011-10-26|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2011-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/31/seven-billionth-baby-born-philippines?intcmp=122 |title=World's 'seven billionth baby' is born|date=2011-10-31|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2011-10-31}}

The recent rapid increase in human population over the past two centuries has raised concerns that the planet may not be able to sustain present or larger numbers of inhabitants. [[Steve Jones (biologist)|Steve Jones]], head of the biology department at [[University College London]], has said, "Humans are 10,000 times more common than we should be". <ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article4894696.ece Leading geneticist Steve Jones says human evolution is over], The Times, 7 October 2008</ref> The [[IAP statement on population growth|InterAcademy Panel Statement on Population Growth]] has stated that many environmental problems, such as rising levels of [[atmospheric carbon dioxide]], [[global warming]], and pollution, are aggravated by the population expansion. <ref>http://www.interacademies.net/?id=3547</ref> Other problems associated with overpopulation include the increased demand for resources such as fresh water and food, starvation and malnutrition, consumption of natural resources faster than the rate of regeneration (such as fossil fuels), and a decrease in living conditions. However, some believe that [[waste]] and [[over-consumption]], especially by wealthy nations, is putting more strain on the environment than overpopulation. <ref>{{cite web|author=by james gustave speth |url=http://e360.yale.edu/feature/consumption_dwarfs_population_as_main_environmental_threat/2140/ |title=Consumption Dwarfs Population as Main Environmental Threat by Fred Pearce: Yale Environment 360 |publisher=E360.yale.edu |accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref> . 

Limiting birth rates through legal regulations, educating people about family planning, increasing access to birth control and contraception, and extraterrestrial settlement have been suggested as ways to mitigate overpopulation in the future. [[China]] and other nations already have regulations limiting the birth rate, with China using the [[one child policy]]. Contraception is a response to the fact that nearly 40% of pregnancies are unintended and that in the poorest regions mothers often lack information and the means to control the size of their families.  . 

==History of concern==. 
Concern about overpopulation is relatively recent in origin. Throughout history, populations have grown slowly despite high [[birth rates]], due to the population-reducing effects of war, [[Plague (disease)|plagues]] and high [[infant mortality]]. During the 750 years before the [[Industrial Revolution]], the world's population increased very slowly, remaining under 250 million. <ref>[[George Moffet]], ''Critical Masses: The Global Population Challenge'' (1994): "[the world's population remained] capped by birth rates and death rates locked in a seemingly permanent equilibrium."</ref> . 

By the beginning of the 19th century, the world population had grown to a billion individuals, and intellectuals such as [[Thomas Malthus]] and [[physiocracy|physiocratic]] economists predicted that mankind would outgrow its available resources, since a finite amount of land was incapable of supporting an endlessly increasing population. [[Mercantilism|Mercantillists]] argued that a large population was a form of wealth, which made it possible to create bigger markets and armies.  . 

A number{{Quantify|date=January 2012}} of eminent scientists contend that overpopulation is not a concern for the Earth. The UN Population Assessment Report of 2003 states that the world population will plateau by 2050 and will remain that way until 2300. Dr Alex Berezow states that overpopulation is not a Western world problem and people often cite China and India as major population contributors; however he notes that with rising wealth in those countries, population will begin to slow, as population growth is strongly linked to the economic stability of a country. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearscience.com/articles/2011/07/20/the_world_is_not_overpopulated_106247.html|title=The World Is Not Overpopulated|publisher=RealClearScience|author=Alex B.

The human population has gone through a number of periods of growth since the dawn of [[civilization]] in the [[Holocene]] period, around 10,000 BCE. The beginning of civilization coincides with the final receding of [[glacial ice]] following the end of the [[last glacial period]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} It is estimated that about 1,000,000 people, subsisting on hunting and [[foraging]], inhabited the Earth in the period before the [[neolithic revolution]], when human activity shifted away from [[Hunter gatherer#History|hunter-gathering]] and towards [[Neolithic Revolution#Agricultural transition|very primitive farming]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} . 

Around 8000 BCE, at the [[Agriculture#History|dawn of agriculture]], the population of the world was approximately 5 million. <ref name=worldometer>"What was the population of the world in the past?", [http://www.worldometers.info/population/ World-o-meters]</ref> The next several millennia saw minimal changes in the population, with a steady growth beginning in 1000 BCE, and a peak of between 200 and 300 million people in 1 BCE.  . 

The [[Plague of Justinian]] caused [[Medieval demography|Europe's population]] to drop by around 50% between 541 and the 8th century. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/health-and-human-body/human-diseases/plague-article.html |title=Plague, Plague Information, Black Death Facts, News, Photos |publisher=National Geographic |accessdate=2008-11-03}}</ref> Steady growth resumed in 800 CE. <ref>"''[http://books.google.com/books?id=GyE8Qt-kS1kC&pg=PA46&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Epidemics and pandemics: their impacts on human history]''".

Encounters between European explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local [[List of epidemics|epidemics]] of extraordinary virulence.

Dramatic growth beginning in 1950 (above 1.8% per year) coincided with greatly increased food production as a result of the industrialisation of agriculture brought about by the [[Green Revolution]]. <ref name="The limits of a Green Revolution">"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/6496585.stm The limits of a Green Revolution?]".

Some people{{who|date=December 2011}} are concerned that the recent sharp population rises in many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, South Asia and [[South East Asia]] is creating problems such as increased demand for resources, especially for the less fortunate countries.

The situation is most acute in northern, western and central Africa. Refugees from places like [[Sudan]] have further strained the resources of neighbouring states like Chad and Egypt. The nation{{clarify|date=December 2011}} is also host to roughly 255,000 [[refugee]]s from Sudan’s [[Darfur]] region, and about 77,000 refugees from the [[Central African Republic]], whilst approximately 188,000 Chadians have been displaced by their own civil war and famines, have either fled to either the Sudan, the Niger or, more recently, [[Libya]].  .

According to the United Nations' World Population Prospects report:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/popin/ |title=World Population Prospects |publisher=United Nations  |accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref> . 

* The [[world population]] is currently growing by approximately 74 million people per year. Current United Nations predictions estimate that the world population will reach 9.0 billion around 2050, assuming a decrease in average [[fertility rate]] from 2.5 down to 2.0. <ref name=UNPop>[http://www.un.org/esa/population/unpop.htm United Nations Population Division Home Page], [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/WorldPop2300final.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - WorldPOP2300.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref>
* Almost all growth will take place in the less developed regions, where today's 5.3 billion population of underdeveloped countries is expected to increase to 7.8 billion in 2050. By contrast, the population of the more developed regions will remain mostly unchanged, at 1.2 billion. An exception is the United States population, which is expected to increase by 44% from 2008 to 2050. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/ |title=US Census Bureau estimates and news release.of AUG. 14, 2008 |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref>
* In 2000–2005, the average world fertility was 2.65 children per woman, about half the level in 1950–1955 (5 children per woman). In the medium variant, global fertility is projected to decline further to 2.05 children per woman. 
* During 2005–2050, nine countries are expected to account for half of the world's projected population increase: [[India]], Pakistan, [[Nigeria]], Democratic Republic of the Congo, [[Bangladesh]], Uganda, United States, Ethiopia, and China, listed according to the size of their contribution to population growth. China would be higher still in this list were it not for its [[one-child policy]]. 
* Global life expectancy at birth is expected to continue rising from 65 years in 2000–2005 to 75 years in 2045–2050. In the more developed regions, the projection is to 82 years by 2050. Among the least developed countries, where life expectancy today is just under 50 years, it is expected to increase to 66 years by 2045–2050. 
* The population of 51 countries or areas is expected to be lower in 2050 than in 2005. 
* During 2005–2050, the net number of international migrants to more developed regions is projected to be 98 million. Because deaths are projected to exceed births in the more developed regions by 73 million during 2005–2050, population growth in those regions will largely be due to international migration. 
* In 2000–2005, net migration in 28 countries either prevented [[population decline]] or doubled at least the contribution of natural increase (births minus deaths) to population growth. <ref name = "un.org-pop918">http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/pop918.doc.html {{Dead link|date=September 2009}}</ref>

==Demographic transition==. 
[[File:World population (UN).svg|thumb|right|300px|United Nation's population projections by location]]
{{Main|Demographic transition|Sub-replacement fertility}}
The theory of demographic transition held that, after the [[standard of living]] and [[life expectancy]] increase, [[family size]]s and [[birth rate]]s decline. However, as new data has become available, it has been observed that after a certain level of development the fertility increases again. <ref>{{cite web
 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7256/abs/nature08230.html
 |title=Advances in development reverse fertility declines
 |date=6 August 2009
 |publisher=Nature
}}</ref> This means that both the worry the theory generated about aging populations and the complacency it bred regarding the future environmental impact of population growth are misguided.  . 

Factors cited in the old theory included such social factors as later ages of marriage, the growing desire of many women in such settings to seek careers outside [[child rearing]] and domestic work, and the decreased need of children in industrialized settings. The latter factor stems from the fact that children [[child labor|perform a great deal of work]] in small-scale agricultural societies, and work less in industrial ones; it has been cited to explain the decline in birth rates in industrializing regions.  . 

Another version of demographic transition is proposed by anthropologist [[Virginia Abernethy]] in her book ''Population Politics'', where she claims that the demographic transition occurs primarily in nations where women enjoy a special status (''see'' [[Virginia Abernethy#Fertility-opportunity hypothesis|Fertility-opportunity theory]]). In strongly [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] nations, where she claims women enjoy few special rights, a high standard of living tends to result in [[population growth]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.  . 

Many countries have high population growth rates but lower total fertility rates because high population growth in the past skewed the age demographic toward a young age, so the population still rises as the more numerous younger generation approaches maturity.{{Or|date=June 2008}}{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} . 

"Demographic entrapment" is a concept developed by Maurice King, Honorary Research Fellow at the [[University of Leeds]], who posits that this phenomenon occurs when a country has a population larger than its carrying capacity, no possibility of migration, and exports too little to be able to import food.

For the world as a whole, the number of [[List of countries and territories by fertility rate|children born per woman]] decreased from 5.02 to 2.65 between 1950 and 2005. A breakdown by region is as follows: . 

* Europe – 2.66 to 1.41
* North America – 3.47 to 1.99
* Oceania – 3.87 to 2.30
* Central America – 6.38 to 2.66
* South America – 5.75 to 2.49
* Asia (excluding Middle East) – 5.85 to 2.43
* Middle East & North Africa – 6.99 to 3.37
* Sub-Saharan Africa – 6.7 to 5.53 . 

Excluding the observed reversal in fertility decrease for high development, the projected world number of children born per woman for 2050 would be around 2.05. Only the Middle East & North Africa (2.09) and Sub-Saharan Africa (2.61) would then have numbers greater than 2.05. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthtrends.wri.org/searchable_db/results.php?years=1950-1955,1955-1960,1960-1965,1965-1970,1970-1975,1975-1980,1980-1985,1985-1990,1990-1995,1995-2000,2000-2005,2045-2050&variable_ID=369&theme=4&cID=&ccID=0,1,6,2,3,5,8,7,4 |title=World Resources Institute |publisher=Earthtrends.wri.org |accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref> .

In a study titled ''Food, Land, Population and the U.S. Economy'', David Pimentel, professor of ecology and agriculture at [[Cornell University]], and Mario Giampietro, senior researcher at the US [[National Research Institute on Food and Nutrition]] (INRAN), estimate the maximum [[U.S. population]] for a [[sustainability|sustainable economy]] at 200 million. And in order to achieve a sustainable economy and avert disaster, the United States would have to reduce its population by at least one-third, and [[world population]] would have to be reduced by two-thirds. <ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://dieoff.org/page40.htm |title=Eating Fossil Fuels &#124; EnergyBulletin.net |publisher=Dieoff.org |date=21 November 1994 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref> .

In 2006, [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]]'s "[[Living Planet Report]]" stated that in order for all humans to live with the current consumption patterns of Europeans, we would be spending three times more than what the planet can renew. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.panda.org/news_facts/publications/living_planet_report/index.cfm |title=WWF LIving planet report |publisher=Panda.org |accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref> Humanity as a whole was using, by 2006, 40 percent more than what Earth can regenerate. <ref>Ecological Footprint Atlas 2009, Global Footprint Network, www.footprintnetwork.org/atlas</ref> . 

But critics question the simplifications and statistical methods used in calculating Ecological Footprints. Therefore Global Footprint Network and its partner organizations have engaged with national governments and international agencies to test the results – reviews have been produced by France, Germany, the European Commission, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Japan and the United Arab Emirates. <ref>http://www.footprintnetwork.org/reviews</ref> Some point out that a more refined method of assessing Ecological Footprint is to designate sustainable versus non-sustainable categories of consumption. <ref>http://www.tinbergen.nl/discussionpapers/98105.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-pam.usc.edu/volume1/v1i1a2print.html |title=Planning and Markets: Peter Gordon and Harry W.

Overpopulation does not depend only on the size or density of the population, but on the ratio of population to available sustainable resources. It also depends on the way resources are used and distributed throughout the population.  . 

The resources to be considered when evaluating whether an ecological niche is overpopulated include [[drinking water|clean water]], clean air, food, shelter, warmth, and other resources necessary to sustain life. If the quality of human life is addressed, there may be additional resources considered, such as medical care, education, proper [[sewage treatment]], [[waste disposal]] and energy supplies. Overpopulation places competitive stress on the basic life sustaining resources,<ref>"[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=growing-population-poses-malthusian-dilemma Another Inconvenient Truth: The World's Growing Population Poses a Malthusian Dilemma]".

There is a need to develop renewable energy resources. Humans everywhere must understand that rapid population growth damages the Earth's resources and diminishes human well-being."<ref>David Pimentel, et al.

These reflect the comments also of the [[United States Geological Survey]] in their paper [http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=653 The Future of Planet Earth: Scientific Challenges in the Coming Century]. "As the global population continues to grow...people will place greater and greater demands on the resources of our planet, including mineral and [[energy resources]], open space, [[water crisis|water]], and plant and animal resources."

A handful of geologists around the world have calculated the costs of new technologies in terms of the materials they use and the implications of their spreading to the developing world. All agree that the planet's booming population and rising standards of living are set to put unprecedented demands on the materials that only Earth itself can provide{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.

On the other hand, some researchers, such as [[Julian Lincoln Simon|Julian Simon]] and [[Bjorn Lomborg]] believe that resources exist for further population growth.

Although all resources, whether mineral or other, are limited on the planet, there is a degree of self-correction whenever a scarcity or high-demand for a particular kind is experienced.  For example in 1990 known reserves of many natural resources were higher, and their prices lower, than in 1970, despite higher demand and higher consumption.  Whenever a price spike would occur, the market tended to correct itself whether by substituting an equivalent resource or switching to a new technology. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpm/wpm2001.pdf|format=PDF|title=UN World Population Report 2001|page=34|accessdate=2008-12-16}}</ref> . 

===Fresh water===. 
{{See|Water crisis}}

Potential problems with dependence on desalination are reviewed below, however, the majority of the world's freshwater supply is contained in the polar icecaps, and underground river systems accessible through springs and wells.  . 

Fresh water can be obtained from salt water by [[desalination]]. For example, [[Malta]] derives two thirds of its freshwater by desalination. A number of [[nuclear power]]ed desalination plants exist;<ref>[http://www.uic.com.au/nip74.htm Nuclear Desalination<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name = "stanford-cohen">http://www.sustainablenuclear.org/PADs/pad11983cohen.pdf</ref> However, the high costs of desalination, especially for poor countries, make impractical the transport of large amounts of desalinated seawater to interiors of large countries. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20020902/barlow |title=Who Owns Water? |publisher=Thenation.com |accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref> The cost of desalinization varies; [[Israel]] is now desalinating water for a cost of 53 cents per cubic meter,<ref name = "ejpress-water"/> [[Singapore]] at 49 cents per cubic meter. <ref name = "edie-distinct"/> In the United States, the cost is 81 cents per cubic meter ($3.06 for 1,000 gallons). <ref>[http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/mar/21/desalination-gets-serious-look/ Desalination gets a serious look], Las Vegas Sun, 21 March 2008</ref> . 

According to a 2004 study by Zhoua and Tolb, "one needs to lift the water by 2000 m, or transport it over more than 1600&nbsp;km to get transport costs equal to the desalination costs. Desalinated water is  expensive in places that are both somewhat far from the sea and somewhat high, such as [[Riyadh]] and [[Harare]]. In other places, the dominant cost is desalination, not transport. This leads to somewhat lower costs in places like Beijing, [[Bangkok]], [[Zaragoza]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], and, of course, coastal cities like [[Tripoli]]." Thus while the study is generally positive about the technology for affluent areas that are proximate to oceans, it concludes that "Desalinated water may be a solution for some water-stress regions, but not for places that are poor, deep in the interior of a continent, or at high elevation. Unfortunately, that includes some of the places with biggest water problems."<ref name="uni-hamburg.de">Evaluating the costs of desalination and water transport. Yuan Zhoua,b, Richard S.J.

The world's largest desalination plant is the [[Jebel Ali]] Desalination Plant (Phase 2) in the [[United Arab Emirates]], which can produce 300 million cubic meters of water per year,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwater.org/data20062007/Table21.pdf |title=100 Largest Desalination Plants Planned, in Construction, or in Operation—January 1, 2005 |format=PDF |accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref>  or about 2500 gallons per second.

However, new data originating from the [[GRACE]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=March 2012}} experiments and isotopic testing done by the [[IAEA]] show that the [[Nubian aquifer]]--which is under the largest, driest part of the earth's surface, has enough water in it to provide for "at least several centuries".  In addition to this, new and highly detailed maps of the earth’s underground reservoirs will be soon created from these technologies that will further allow proper budgeting of cheap water. <ref>http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328512.200-uncharted-waters-probing-aquifers-to-head-off-war.html</ref> . 

===Food===. 
Some scientists argue that there is enough food to support the world population,<ref>Michael Haynes, Rumy Husan 2000 "National inequality and the catch-up period: Some "growth alone" scenarios" Journal of Economic Issues. 34:3 "In a world that now produces more food than is necessary to feed all its population [UN 1994], there is no excuse for hunger and starvation."</ref><ref>Bernard Gilland "World population and food supply can food production keep pace with population growth in the next half-century?"

However, many countries rely heavily on imports. [[Egypt]] and [[Iran]] rely on imports for 40% of their grain supply. [[Yemen]] and [[Israel]] import more than 90%. And just 6 countries – [[Argentina]], Australia, Canada, France, [[Thailand]] and the USA – supply 90% of grain exports. In recent decades the US alone supplied almost half of world grain exports. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earth-policy.org/Books/Out/Ote1_5.htm |title=Pushing Beyond the Earth's Limits The Japan Syndrome |publisher=Earth-policy.org |accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref><ref name="The Food Bubble Economy">{{cite web|url=http://www.i-sis.org.uk/TFBE.php |title=The Food Bubble Economy |publisher=I-sis.org.uk |date=12 April 2002 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref> . 

A 2001 United Nations report says population growth is "the main force driving increases in agricultural demand" but "most recent expert assessments are cautiously optimistic about the ability of global food production to keep up with demand for the foreseeable future (that is to say, until approximately 2030 or 2050)", assuming declining population growth rates. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpm/wpm2001.pdf|format=PDF|title=UN World Population Report 2001|page=38|accessdate=2008-12-16}}</ref> . 

However, the observed figures for 2007 show an actual increase in absolute numbers of undernourished people in the world, 923 million in 2007 versus 832 million in 1995.;<ref>[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] Economic and Social Development Department.

The amounts of natural resources in this context are not necessarily fixed, and their distribution is not necessarily a [[zero-sum game]]. For example, due to the [[Green Revolution]] and the fact that more and more land is appropriated each year from wild lands for agricultural purposes, the worldwide production of food had steadily increased up until 1995.

As world population doubled from 3 billion to 6 billion, daily [[Calorie]] consumption in poor countries increased from 1,932 to 2,650, and the percentage of people in those countries who were malnourished fell from 45% to 18%.

[[File:Percentage population undernourished world map.PNG|thumb|right|Percentage of population suffering from malnutrition by country, according to United Nations statistics.]]
The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations states in its report ''The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2006'', that while the number of undernourished people in the developing countries has declined by about three million, a smaller proportion of the populations of developing countries is undernourished today than in 1990–92: 17% against 20%. Furthermore, FAO's projections suggest that the proportion of hungry people in developing countries could be halved from 1990–92 levels to 10% by 2015. The FAO also states "We have emphasized first and foremost that reducing hunger is no longer a question of means in the hands of the global community. The world is richer today than it was ten years ago. There is more food available and still more could be produced without excessive upward pressure on prices. The knowledge and resources to reduce hunger are there. What is lacking is sufficient political will to mobilize those resources to the benefit of the hungry."<ref>{{PDFlink|[ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/a0750e/a0750e01.pdf]}}</ref> .

It is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain [[food security]] in a world beset by a confluence of "peak" phenomena, namely [[peak oil]], [[peak water]], [[peak phosphorus]], [[peak grain]] and peak fish. Growing populations, falling energy sources and food shortages will create the "perfect storm" by 2030, according to the UK government chief scientist. He said food reserves are at a 50-year low but the world requires 50% more energy, food and water by 2030. <ref>"[http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/mar/18/perfect-storm-john-beddington-energy-food-climate World faces 'perfect storm' of problems by 2030, chief scientist to warn]".

====Asia====. 
According to a 2004 article from the BBC, China, the world's most populous country, suffers from an "[[obesity]] surge". The article stated that, "Altogether, around 200 million people are thought to be overweight, 22.8% of the population, and 60 million (7.1%) obese". <ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3737162.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Chinese concern at obesity surge | date=12 October 2004 | accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref> More recent data indicate China's grain production peaked in the mid 1990s, due to overextraction of [[groundwater]] in the North China plain. <ref>[http://www.greatlakesdirectory.org/zarticles/080902_water_shortages.htm Global Water Shortages May Lead to Food Shortages—Aquifer Depletion]</ref> . 

====Other countries====.

====Population as a function of food availability====. 
Thinkers such as David Pimentel,<ref>Hopfenberg, Russell and Pimentel, David, "Human Population Numbers as a Function of Food Supply", ''Environment, Development and Sustainability'', vol. 3, no. 1, March, 2001, pp. 1–15</ref> a professor from [[Cornell University]], [[Virginia Abernethy]],<ref>Abernathy, Virginia, ''Population Politics'' ISBN 0765806037</ref> Alan Thornhill,<ref>''Food Production & Population Growth'', video with Daniel Quinn and Alan Thornhill</ref> Russell Hopffenberg<ref>Hopfenberg, Russell, "Human Carrying Capacity Is Determined by Food Availability", ''Population & Environment'', vol. 25, no. 2, November 2003, pp. 109–117</ref> and author [[Daniel Quinn]]<ref>Quinn, Daniel, ''[[Ishmael (novel)|Ishmael]]'' ISBN 0-553-07875-5</ref> propose that like all other animals, human populations predictably grow and shrink according to their available food supply – populations grow in an abundance of food, and shrink in times of scarcity.  . 

Proponents of this theory argue that every time food production is increased, the population grows. Some human populations throughout history support this theory. Populations of [[hunter-gatherer]]s fluctuate in accordance with the amount of available food. Population increased after the [[Neolithic Revolution]] and an increased food supply. This was followed by subsequent population growth after subsequent [[agricultural revolution]]s.  . 

Critics of this idea point out that birth rates are lowest in the [[developed nation]]s, which also have the highest access to food. In fact, some developed countries have both a diminishing population and an abundant food supply. The United Nations projects that the population of 51 countries or areas, including Germany, Italy, Japan and most of the states of the former Soviet Union, is expected to be lower in 2050 than in 2005. <ref name = "un.org-pop918"/>  This shows that when one limits their scope to the population living within a given political boundary, human populations do not always grow to match the available food supply. Additionally, many of these countries are major ''exporters'' of food.  . 

Nevertheless, on the global scale the [[world population]] is increasing,<ref>Daniel Quinn in his book, "The Story Of B"</ref>  as is the net quantity of human food produced – a pattern that has been true for roughly 10,000 years, since the human development of agriculture. That some countries demonstrate negative population growth fails to discredit the theory. Food moves across borders from areas of abundance to areas of scarcity. Additionally, this hypothesis is not so simplistic as to be rejected by a single case study, as in Germany's recent population trends – clearly other factors are at work: [[contraceptive]] access, cultural norms and most importantly economic realities differ from nation to nation.  . 

====As a result of water deficits====. 
[[Water deficits]], which are already spurring heavy grain imports in numerous smaller countries, may soon do the same in larger countries, such as China or India, if technology is not used. <ref>{{cite web|author=21 Jul 2006 |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/HG21Df01.html |title=Asia Times Online :: South Asia news – India grows a grain crisis |publisher=Atimes.com |date=21 July 2006 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref> The water tables are falling in scores of countries (including Northern China, the US, and India) owing to widespread [[overdrafting]] beyond [[sustainable]] yields.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Other countries affected include Pakistan, [[Iran]], and Mexico. This overdrafting is already leading to water scarcity and cutbacks in grain harvest. Even with the overpumping of its [[aquifers]], China has developed a grain deficit. This effect has contributed in driving grain prices upward. Most of the 3 billion people projected to be added worldwide by mid-century will be born in countries already experiencing [[water shortages]]. One suggested solution is for [[population growth]] to be slowed quickly by investing heavily in female [[literacy]] and [[family planning]] services. <ref>[http://www.greatlakesdirectory.org/zarticles/080902_water_shortages.htm Global Water Shortages May Lead to Food Shortages-Aquifer Depletion<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Desalination]] is also considered a viable and effective solution to the problem of water shortages. <ref name = "ejpress-water">{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/4873 |title=EJP &#124; News &#124; France &#124; French-run water plant launched in Israel |publisher=Ejpress.org |date=28 December 2005 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref><ref name = "edie-distinct">{{cite web|url=http://www.edie.net/news/news_story.asp?id=11402&channel=0 |title=Black & Veatch-Designed Desalination Plant Wins Global Water Distinction |publisher=Edie.net |date=4 May 2006 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref> . 

After China and India, there is a second tier of smaller countries with large water deficits – [[Algeria]], Egypt, [[Iran]], Mexico, and Pakistan. Four of these already import a large share of their grain. Only Pakistan remains self-sufficient. But with a population expanding by 4 million a year, it will also soon turn to the world market for grain. <ref name="The Food Bubble Economy"/> . 

===Land===.

The World Resources Institute states that "Agricultural conversion to croplands and managed [[pasture]]s has affected some 3.3 billion [hectares] – roughly 26 percent of the land area.

High [[crop yield]] vegetables like potatoes and lettuce{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} <!--Lettuce is high yield?--> use less space on inedible plant parts, like stalks, husks, vines, and inedible leaves. New varieties of selectively bred and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] plants have larger edible parts (fruit, vegetable, grain) and smaller inedible parts; however, many of these gain of agricultural technology are now historic, and new advances are more difficult to achieve. With new technologies, it is possible to grow crops on some marginal land under certain conditions. [[Aquaculture]] could theoretically increase available area. [[Hydroponics]] and food from bacteria and fungi, like [[quorn]], may allow the growing of food without having to consider land quality, climate, or even available sunlight, although such a process may be very energy-intensive.  Some argue that not all arable land will remain productive if used for agriculture because some [[marginal land]] can only be made to produce food by unsustainable practices like [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture. Even with the modern techniques of agriculture, the sustainability of production is in question.  . 

Some countries, such as the [[United Arab Emirates]] and particularly the Emirate of [[Dubai]] have constructed large artificial islands, or have created large dam and dike systems, like the Netherlands, which reclaim land from the sea to increase their total land area. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=463694&in_page_id=1811 |location=London |work=Daily Mail  | title=Meet the first resident of Dubai's palm-shaped man-made island | date=22 June 2007}}</ref>  Some scientists have said that in the future, densely populated cities will use [[vertical farming]] to grow food inside skyscrapers. <ref name = "BBC-nyc">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6752795.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Vertical farming in the big Apple | date=19 June 2007 | accessdate=20 May 2010 | first=Jeremy | last=Cooke}}</ref> The notion that space is limited has been decried by skeptics, who point out that the Earth's population of roughly 6.8 billion people could comfortably inhabit an area comparable in size to the state of Texas, in the United States (about {{convert|269000|sqmi|km2|2|disp=or|sigfig=6}}). <ref>{{cite web|url=http://overpopulationisamyth.com/overpopulation-the-making-of-a-myth#FAQ5|title=Overpopulation: The Making of a Myth|accessdate=2010-02-13}}</ref> However, the impact of humanity extends over a far greater area than that required simply for habitation.  .

Similarly, although the proportion of "starving" people in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] has decreased, the absolute number of starving people has increased due to population growth. The percentage dropped from 38% in 1970 to 33% in 1996 and was expected to be 30% by 2010. <ref name=autogenerated1 />  But the region's population roughly doubled between 1970 and 1996. To keep the numbers of starving constant, the percentage would have dropped by more than half. <ref name = "ecosystems-#3"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenfacts.org/en/ecosystems/millennium-assessment-3/3-human-wellbeing-poverty.htm#3p0 |title=3.

[[File:TFR vs PPP 2009.svg|right|thumb|350px|wealth per capita graphed against [[fertility rate]].]]  As of 2004, there were 108 countries in the world with more than five million people.  All of these in which women have, on the average, more than 4 children in their lifetime, have a per capita GDP of less than $5000. Only in two countries with per capita GDP above ~$15,000 do women have, on the average, more than 2 children in their lifetime: these are Israel and Saudi Arabia, with average lifetime births per woman between 2 and 4.  . 

As their income increases, women are [[women's liberation|liberated]] and tend to have fewer "quantity kids", as in two in place of six. <ref>{{cite video|people=Brand, Stewart|title=Lecture Series presented by KPMG – Whole Earth Discipline|url=http://www.q2cfestival.com/play.php?lecture_id=8030|date=24 October 2009|publisher=Perimeter Institute, Quantum to Cosmos (Q2C) Festival|location=Waterloo, Ontario, Canada|accessdate=2009-10-25|time=50:30}}</ref> . 

The correlation does not imply cause and effect, and can be linked to the interplay of birth rates, death rates and economic development.  . 

==Environment==. 
Overpopulation has substantially adversely impacted the environment of Earth starting at least as early as the 20th century. <ref name="Nielsen" /> There are also economic consequences of this [[environmental degradation]] in the form of [[ecosystem services]] attrition. <ref>The New Economy of Nature: The Quest to Make Conservation Profitable (ISBN 1-55963-945-8), Gretchen C. Daily and Katherine Ellison</ref>  Beyond the scientifically verifiable harm to the environment, some assert the moral right of other species to simply exist rather than become extinct.

Says Peter Raven, former President of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) in their seminal work [http://atlas.aaas.org/ AAAS Atlas of Population & Environment], "Where do we stand in our efforts to achieve a sustainable world? Clearly, the past half century has been a traumatic one, as the collective impact of human numbers, affluence (consumption per individual) and our choices of technology continue to exploit rapidly an increasing proportion of the world's resources at an unsustainable rate. ... During a remarkably short period of time, we have lost a quarter of the world's [[topsoil]] and a fifth of its agricultural land, altered the composition of the [[atmosphere]] profoundly, and destroyed a major proportion of our forests and other natural [[habitat]]s without replacing them. Worst of all, we have driven the rate of biological [[extinction]], the permanent loss of species, up several hundred times beyond its historical levels, and are threatened with the loss of a majority of all species by the end of the 21st century." . 

Further, even in countries which have both large population growth and major ecological problems, it is not necessarily true that curbing the population growth will make a major contribution towards resolving all environmental problems. <ref name="UN World Population Report 2001"/>  However, as developing countries with high populations become more industrialized, pollution and consumption will invariably increase.  . 

The [[Worldwatch Institute]] said the booming economies of [[People's Republic of China|China]] and India are planetary powers that are shaping the global biosphere.  The report states: .

* '''Inadequate fresh water'''<ref name = "Shiklomanov-11-32"/> for [[drinking water]] use as well as [[sewage treatment]] and [[effluent]] discharge.

* '''Less personal freedom and more restrictive laws.'''  Laws regulate interactions between humans. Law "serves as a primary social mediator of relations between people."  The higher the population density, the more frequent such interactions become, and thus there develops a need for more laws and/or more restrictive laws to regulate these interactions. It was even speculated by [[Aldous Huxley]] in 1958 that democracy is threatened due to overpopulation, and could give rise to [[totalitarian]] style governments. <ref>[http://www.huxley.net/bnw-revisited/index.html#overpop Brave New World Revisited I.

Many of these problems are addressed in the science fiction film ''[[Soylent Green]]''.  . 

Some economists, such as [[Thomas Sowell]]<ref>[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/sowell021298.html%22 Julian Simon, combatant in a 200-year war], Thomas Sowell,  12 February 1998</ref> and [[Walter E.

Most biologists and sociologists see overpopulation as a serious threat to the quality of human life. <ref name="Nielsen"/><ref>E.O. Wilson, ''The Future of Life''</ref> . 

=== Overpopulation and warfare === . 

The [[hypothesis]] that population pressure causes increased [[warfare]] ([[War#Youth bulge theory|youth bulge theory]]) has been recently criticized on the empirical grounds. Both studies focusing on specific historical societies and analyses of cross-cultural data have failed to find positive correlation between population density and incidence of warfare. [[Andrey Korotayev]], in collaboration with [[Peter Turchin]], has shown that such negative results do not falsify the population-warfare hypothesis. <ref>Turchin P., Korotayev A. [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=281&Itemid=1 Population Dynamics and Internal Warfare: A Reconsideration]. ''[[Social Evolution & History]]'' 5/2 (2006): 112–147. </ref> Population and warfare are dynamical variables, and if their interaction causes sustained oscillations, then we do not in general expect to find strong correlation between the two variables measured at the same time (that is, unlagged). Korotayev and Turchin have explored mathematically what the dynamical patterns of interaction between population and warfare (focusing on internal warfare) might be in both stateless and state societies. Next, they have tested the model predictions in several empirical case studies: early modern England, Han and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] China, and the [[Roman Empire]]. Their empirical results have supported the population-warfare theory: Korotayev and Turchin have found that there is a tendency for population numbers and internal warfare intensity to oscillate with the same period but shifted in phase (with warfare peaks following population peaks). Furthermore, they have demonstrated that in the agrarian societies the rates of change of the two variables behave precisely as predicted by the theory: population rate of change is negatively affected by warfare intensity, while warfare rate of change is positively affected by population density. <ref>Turchin P., Korotayev A. [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=281&Itemid=1 Population Dynamics and Internal Warfare: A Reconsideration].

==Mitigation measures==. 
There are several mitigation measures that have been or can be applied to reduce the adverse impacts of overpopulation. All of these mitigations are ways to implement social norms. Overpopulation is an issue that threatens the state of the environment in the above-mentioned ways and therefore societies must make a change in order to reverse some of the environmental effects brought on by current social norms. In societies like China, the government has put policies in place that regulate the number of children allowed to a couple. Other societies have already begun to implement social marketing strategies in order to educate the public on overpopulation effects. "The intervention can be widespread and done at a low cost. A variety of print materials (flyers, brochures, fact sheets, stickers) needs to be produced and distributed throughout the communities such as at local places of worships, sporting events, local food markets, schools and at car parks (taxis  / bus stands)."<ref>{{cite news

 |date= 13 August 2009
 | accessdate=12 December 2010}}</ref> Such prompts work to introduce the problem so that social norms are easier to implement. Certain government policies are making it easier and more socially acceptable to use contraception and abortion methods. An example of a country whose laws and norms are hindering the global effort to slow population growth is Afghanistan. “The approval by Afghan President Hamid Karzai of the Shia Personal Status Law in March 2009 effectively destroyed Shia women’s rights and freedoms in Afghanistan. Under this law, women have no right to deny their husbands sex unless they are ill, and can be denied food if they do.”<ref>{{cite news

===Birth regulations===. 
{{See also|Religious views on birth control}} . 

Overpopulation is related to the issue of [[birth control]]; some nations, like the People's Republic of China, use strict measures to reduce birth rates. Religious and ideological opposition to birth control has been cited as a factor contributing to overpopulation and poverty. <ref>{{cite news

[[Indira Gandhi]], late Prime Minister of India, implemented a forced [[Compulsory sterilization|sterilization]] programme in the 1970s. Officially, men with two children or more had to submit to sterilization, but many unmarried young men, political opponents and ignorant men were also believed to have been sterilized. This program is still remembered and criticized in India, and is blamed for creating a public aversion to [[family planning]], which hampered Government programmes for decades. <ref>Vinay Lal.

If that allotment was determined to be one child, for example, then the first child would be free, and the market would determine what the license fee for each additional child would cost. Extra credits would expire after a certain time, so these credits could not be hoarded by speculators. The actual cost of the credits would only be a fraction of the actual [[Cost of raising a child|cost of having and raising a child]], so the credits would serve more as a wake-up call to women who might otherwise produce children without seriously considering the long term consequences to themselves or society. <ref>http://laborsofhercules.org/ The Labors of Hercules Modern Solutions to 12 Herculean Problems-Labor II: Overpopulation</ref> . 

===Education and empowerment=== . 

One option is to focus on education about overpopulation, [[family planning]], and [[birth control]] methods, and to make birth-control devices like male/[[female condom|female]] [[condoms]], [[combined oral contraceptive pill|pills]] and [[intrauterine device]]s easily available.

[[Egypt]] announced a program to reduce its overpopulation by family planning education and putting [[women in the workforce]].

===Extraterrestrial settlement===. 
In the 1970s, [[Gerard O'Neill]] suggested building [[space habitats]] that could support 30,000 times the carrying capacity of Earth using just the asteroid belt and that the [[Solar System]] as a whole could sustain current population growth rates for a thousand years. <ref>*[[The High Frontier]] (1976, 2000) [[Gerard O'Neill]], Apogee Books ISBN 1-896522-67-X</ref> [[Marshall Savage]] (1992, 1994) has projected a human population of five quintillion throughout the Solar System by 3000, with the majority in the [[asteroid belt]]. <ref>[[Marshall Savage]], (1992, 1994) ''[[The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps]].'' Little, Brown. ISBN 0-316-77163-5</ref>  [[Freeman Dyson]] (1999) favours the [[Kuiper belt]] as the future home of humanity, suggesting this could happen within a few centuries. <ref>[[Freeman Dyson]], ''The Sun, The Genome, and The Internet'' (1999) Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-513922-4</ref> In ''[[Mining the Sky: Untold Riches from the Asteroids, Comets, and Planets|Mining the Sky]]'', [[John&nbsp;S. Lewis]] suggests that the resources of the solar system could support 10 [[1,000,000,000,000,000|quadrillion]] (10<sup>16</sup>) people.  . 

[[K. Eric Drexler]], famous inventor of the futuristic concept of [[molecular nanotechnology]], has suggested in ''[[Engines of Creation]]'' that colonizing space will mean breaking the [[Malthusian catastrophe|Malthusian limits]] to growth for the human species.  . 

It may be possible for other parts of the Solar System to be inhabited by humanity at some point in the future. [[Geoffrey A. Landis|Geoffrey Landis]] of [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]]'s [[Glenn Research Center]] in particular has pointed out that "[at] cloud-top level, Venus is the paradise planet", as one could construct [[aerostat]] habitats and [[Floating city (science fiction)|floating cities]] there easily, based on the concept that breathable air is a lifting gas in the dense [[Atmosphere of Venus|Venusian atmosphere]]. [[Venus]] would, like also [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]], in the upper layers of their atmospheres, even afford a [[gravitation]] almost exactly as strong as [[g-force|that on Earth]] (''see'' [[colonization of Venus]]). <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.universetoday.com/15570/colonizing-venus-with-floating-cities/ |title=Colonizing Venus With Floating Cities |author=Nancy Atkinson |date=16 Jul. 2008 |work=[[Universe Today]] |accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref> Many authors, including [[Carl Sagan]], Arthur&nbsp;C. Clarke,<ref name = clarkebipeds>''Greetings, Carbon-Based Bipeds!'' (1999) [[Arthur C. Clarke]], Voyager ISBN 0-00-224698-8</ref> and [[Isaac Asimov]],<ref>''The Good Earth Is Dying'' (1971) [[Isaac Asimov]] (published in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'')</ref> have argued that shipping the excess population into space is not a viable solution to human overpopulation. According to Clarke, "the population battle must be fought or won here on Earth". <ref name = clarkebipeds/> The problem for these authors is not the lack of resources in space (as shown in books such as ''Mining the Sky''<ref>[[Mining the Sky: Untold Riches from the Asteroids, Comets, and Planets|Mining the Sky]] (1996) [[John&nbsp;S. Lewis]]. Addison Wesley. ISBN 0-201-47959-1</ref>), but the physical impracticality of shipping vast numbers of people into space to "solve" overpopulation on Earth. However, [[Gerard O'Neill]]'s calculations show that Earth could offload all new population growth with a launch services industry about the same size as the current airline industry. <ref>{{cite book|author=O'Neill, Gerard K.|year=1981|title=2081: A Hopeful View of the Human Future|publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=0-671-44751-3}}</ref> A&nbsp;hypothetical extraterrestrial colony could potentially grow organically, with most of the inhabitants being the direct descendants of the original colonists.  .
