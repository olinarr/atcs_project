The '''Voluntary Human Extinction Movement''' ('''VHEMT'''{{#tag:ref|VHEMT is pronounced "vehement",<ref name=npr>{{cite news|last=Pesca|first=Mike|title=All Choked Up|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5401422|accessdate=January 7, 2012|newspaper=NPR|date=May 12, 2006}}</ref> because, according to Knight, that is what they are. <ref name=te/>|group=upper-alpha}}) is an [[environmental movement]] that calls for all people to abstain from reproduction to cause the gradual voluntary [[Human extinction|extinction of humankind]]. VHEMT supports human extinction primarily because, in the group's view, it would prevent [[environmental degradation]]. The group states that a decrease in the human population would prevent a significant amount of man-made human suffering. The extinctions of non-human species and the scarcity of resources required by humans are frequently cited by the group as evidence of the harm caused by human [[overpopulation]].  . 

VHEMT was founded in 1991 by Les U. Knight, an American activist who became involved in the [[Environmental movement in the United States|environmental movement]] in the 1970s and thereafter concluded that human extinction was the best solution to the problems facing the Earth's [[biosphere]] and humanity. Knight publishes the group's newsletter and serves as its spokesperson. Although the group is promoted by a website and represented at some environmental events, it relies heavily on coverage from outside media to spread its message. Many commentators view its platform as unacceptably extreme, though other writers have applauded VHEMT's perspective. In response to VHEMT, some journalists and academics have argued that humans can develop sustainable lifestyles or can reduce their population to sustainable levels. Others maintain that, whatever the merits of the idea, because of the human reproductive drive humankind will never voluntarily seek extinction.  . 

== History ==. 
The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement was founded by Les U. Knight,<ref name=te/><ref name=ti/>{{#tag:ref|Knight denies that he is the founder, saying that "I’m not the founder of VHEMT, I just gave it a name."<ref>{{cite web|title=Personal information about Les U. Knight|url=http://www.vhemt.org/les.htm|publisher=The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement|accessdate=March 23, 2012}}</ref>|group=upper-alpha}} a secondary school substitute teacher who lives in [[Portland, Oregon]]. <ref name=te/> Although he was raised in a large family,<ref name=sfc/> after becoming involved in the environmental movement as a college student in the 1970s, Knight attributed most of the dangers faced by the planet to human overpopulation. After coming to this conclusion, he joined the [[Zero Population Growth]] organization<ref name=te/> and chose to be [[vasectomy|vasectomised]] at age 25. <ref name=sfc>{{cite news|last=Dicum|first=Gregory|title=Maybe None|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2005/11/16/gree.DTL|accessdate=January 7, 2012|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=November 16, 2005}}</ref> He later concluded that the extinction of humanity would be the best solution to the Earth's environmental problems. <ref name=te>{{cite news|title=Sui genocide|url=http://www.economist.com/node/179963|accessdate=January 7, 2012|newspaper=The Economist|date=December 17, 1998}}</ref> He believes that this idea has also been held by some people throughout human history.{{sfn|Ormrod|2011|p=142}} . 

In 1991, Knight began publishing VHEMT's newsletter,<ref name=te/> known as ''These Exit Times''. <ref name=ti/> In the newsletter, he asked readers to further human extinction by not procreating. <ref name=te/> VHEMT has also published cartoons,<ref name=ta>{{cite news|title=Sites answer 300 million questions|url=http://www.timesargus.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061022/NEWS/610220322/1016/FEATURES07|accessdate=March 9, 2012|newspaper=Barre Montpelier Times Argus|date=October 22, 2006}}</ref> including a comic strip titled "Bonobo Baby", featuring a woman who forgoes childbearing in favor of adopting a [[bonobo]]. <ref name=ti>{{cite news|last=Jarvis|first=Stephen|title=Live long and die out: Stephen Jarvis encounters the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/live-long-and-die-out-stephen-jarvis-encounters-the-voluntary-human-extinction-movement-1372200.html|accessdate=January 7, 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=April 24, 1994}}</ref> In 1996, Knight created a website for VHEMT;{{sfn|Ormrod|2011|p=143}} it was available in 11 languages by 2010.{{sfn|Weisman|2010|p=310}} VHEMT's logo features the letter "V" (for voluntary) and an inverted Earth (i.e., with north at the bottom). <ref name=vhemtlogo>{{cite web|title=Symbolism of the logo for the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement|url=http://vhemt.org/logo.htm|publisher=Voluntary Human Extinction Movement|accessdate=January 22, 2012}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|VHEMT states that the inverted Earth represents the radical shift in human direction the movement seeks, and notes that upside down emblems are often used as symbols of distress. <ref name=vhemtlogo/>|group=upper-alpha}} . 

== Organization and promotion ==. 
VHEMT functions as a loose network rather than a formal organization,{{sfn|Ormrod|2011|pp=142–3}} and does not compile a list of members. Daniel Metz of [[Willamette University]] stated in 1995 that VHEMT's mailing list had just under 400 subscribers. <ref name=te/> Six years later, [[Fox News]] said the list had only 230 subscribers. <ref name=fox/> Knight says that anyone who agrees with his ideology is a member of the movement;<ref name=te/> and that this includes "millions of people". <ref name=aboutvhemt>

Knight serves as the spokesman for VHEMT. <ref name=te/> He attends environmental conferences and events, where he publicizes information about population growth.{{sfn|Weisman|2010|p=310}} VHEMT's message has, however, primarily been spread through coverage by media outlets, rather than events and its newsletter.{{sfn|Ormrod|2011|p=143}} VHEMT sells buttons and T-shirts,{{sfn|Ormrod|2011|p=143}} as well as [[bumper sticker]]s that read "Thank you for not breeding". <ref name=ti/> .

Knight argues that the [[human population]] is far greater than the Earth can handle, and that the best thing for Earth's biosphere is for humans to voluntarily cease reproducing. <ref name="CNN Technology"/> He says that humans are "incompatible with the biosphere"<ref name=ti/> and that human existence is causing environmental damage which will eventually bring about the extinction of humans (as well as other organisms). <ref name=cbc/> According to Knight, the vast majority of human societies have not lived [[Sustainable living|sustainable lifestyles]],<ref name=sfc/> and attempts to live environmentally friendly lifestyles do not change the fact that human existence has ultimately been destructive to the Earth and many of its non-human organisms. <ref name=ti/> Voluntary human extinction is promoted on the grounds that it will prevent human suffering and the [[Extinction#Modern extinctions|extinction of other species]]; Knight points out that many species are threatened by the increasing human population. <ref name=te/><ref name=fox>{{cite news|title=Anti-People Group Pushes for Man's Extinction|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110429112341/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,30834,00.html|accessdate=February 19, 2012|newspaper=Foxnews.com|date=July 29, 2001}}</ref><ref name="CNN Technology"/> . 

James Ormrod, a psychologist who profiled the group in the journal ''Psychoanalysis, Culture & Society'', notes that the "most fundamental belief" of VHEMT is that "human beings should stop reproducing", and that some people consider themselves members of the group but do not actually support human extinction.{{sfn|Ormrod|2011|p=143}} Knight, however, believes that even if humans become more environmentally friendly, they could still return to environmentally destructive lifestyles and hence should eliminate themselves. <ref name=sfc/> Residents of [[First World]] countries bear the most responsibility to change, according to Knight, as they consume a large proportion of resources. <ref name=og/> . 

Knight believes that Earth's non-human organisms have a higher overall value than humans and their accomplishments, such as art: "The plays of Shakespeare and the work of Einstein can't hold a candle to a tiger". <ref name=ti/> He argues that species higher in the [[food chain]] are less important than lower species. <ref name=ti/> His ideology is drawn in part from [[deep ecology]], and he sometimes refers to the Earth as [[Gaianism|Gaia]].{{sfn|Ormrod|2011|p=158}} He notes that human extinction is unavoidable, and that it is better to become extinct soon to avoid concomitant extinctions. <ref name="CNN Technology">

VHEMT rejects government-mandated [[human population control]] programs in favor of voluntary population reduction,<ref name=te/> supporting only the use of [[birth control]] and willpower to prevent pregnancies. <ref name=ti/> Knight states that coercive tactics are unlikely to permanently lower the human population, citing the fact that humanity has survived catastrophic wars, famines, and viruses.{{sfn|Weisman|2010|p=310}} Though their newsletter's name recalls the suicide manual ''[[Final Exit]]'',<ref name=cbc>{{cite news|last=Savory|first=Eve|title=VHEMT: The case against humans|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2008/09/03/f-savory-vhemt.html|accessdate=January 7, 2012|newspaper=CBC News|date=September 4, 2008}}</ref> the idea of mass suicide is rejected,<ref name=og>{{cite news|last=Buarque|first=Daniel|title=Cada pessoa nova é um fardo para o planeta, diz movimento da extinção |trans_title=Every new person is a burden on the planet, says the extinction movement |url=http://g1.globo.com/mundo/noticia/2011/10/cada-pessoa-nova-e-um-fardo-para-o-planeta-diz-movimento-da-extincao.html|language=Portuguese|accessdate=January 7, 2012|newspaper=Organizações Globo|date=October 31, 2011}}</ref> and they have adopted the slogan "May we live long and die out". <ref name=sfc/> A 1995 survey of VHEMT members found that a majority of VHEMT members felt a strong moral obligation to protect the earth, distrusted the ability of political processes to prevent harm to the environment, and were willing to surrender some of their rights for their cause. VHEMT members who strongly believed that "Civilization [is] headed for collapse" were most likely to embrace these views.{{sfn|Ellis|1998|p=267}} However, VHEMT does not take any overt political stances.{{sfn|Ormrod|2011|p=143}} . 

VHEMT promotes a more extreme ideology than [[Population Action International]], a group that argues humanity should reduce—but not eliminate—its population to care for the Earth. However, the VHEMT platform is more moderate and serious than the [[Church of Euthanasia]], which advocates population reduction by suicide and cannibalism. <ref name=fox/><ref name=maclean/> The 1995 survey found that 36% considered themselves members of [[Earth First!]] or had donated to the group in the previous five years.{{sfn|Ellis|1998|p=382–3}} . 

== Reception ==. 
Knight states his group's ideology runs counter to contemporary society's [[natalism]]. He believes this pressure has stopped many people from supporting, or even discussing, population control. <ref name=sfc/> He admits that his group is unlikely to succeed, but contends that attempting to reduce the Earth's population is the only moral option. <ref name=ti/> . 

Reception of Knight's idea in the mainstream media has been mixed. Writing in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', Gregory Dicum states that there is an "undeniable logic" to VHEMT's arguments, but he doubts whether Knight's ideas can succeed, arguing that many people desire to have children and cannot be dissuaded. <ref name=sfc/> Stephen Jarvis echoes this skepticism in ''[[The Independent]]'', noting that VHEMT faces great difficulty owing to the human reproductive drive. <ref name=ti/> At the ''[[The Guardian]]'''s website, Guy Dammann applauds the movement's aim as "in many ways laudable", but argues that it is absurd to believe that humans will voluntarily seek extinction. <ref name=gd>{{cite news|last=Dammann|first=Guy|title=Am I fit to breed?|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/dec/28/children-parents|accessdate=January 7, 2012|newspaper=guardian.co.uk|date=December 28, 2008}}</ref> Freelance writer Abby O'Reilly writes that since having children is frequently viewed as a measure of success, VHEMT's goal is difficult to attain. <ref name=tg02>{{cite news|last=O'Reilly|first=Abby|title=No more babies, please|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/nov/24/nomorebabiesplease|accessdate=January 7, 2012|newspaper=guardian.co.uk|date=November 24, 2007}}</ref> Knight contends in response to these arguments that though sexual desire is natural, human desire for children is a product of [[enculturation]]. <ref name=ti/> . 

The [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York]] has criticized Knight's platform, arguing that the existence of humanity is divinely ordained. <ref name=fox/> Ormrod claims that Knight "arguably abandons deep ecology in favour of straightforward misanthropy". He notes that Knight's claim that the last humans in an extinction scenario would have an abundance of resources promotes his cause based on "benefits accruing to humans". Ormrod sees this type of argument as counter-intuitive, arguing that it borrows the language of "late-modern consumer societies". He faults Knight for what he sees as a failure to develop a consistent and unambiguous ideology.{{sfn|Ormrod|2011|p=158}} ''[[The Economist]]'' characterizes Knight's claim that voluntary human extinction is advisable due to limited resources as "Malthusian bosh". The paper further states that compassion for the planet does not necessarily require the pursuit of human extinction. <ref name=te/> Sociologist [[Frank Furedi]] also deems VHEMT to be a [[Malthusian]] group, classifying them as a type of environmental organization that "[thinks] the worst about the human species". <ref name=spike>{{cite news|last=Furedi|first=Frank|title=Environmentalism|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/3817|accessdate=March 9, 2012|newspaper=Spiked|date=September 12, 2007}}</ref> Writing in ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'', Josie Appleton argues that the group is indifferent to humanity, rather than "anti-human". <ref name=spiked1/> . 

Brian Bethune writes in ''[[Maclean's]]'' that Knight's logic is "as absurd as it's unassailable". However, he doubts Knight's claim that the last survivors of the human race would have pleasant lives and suspects that a "collective loss of the will to live" would prevail. <ref name=maclean/> In response to Knight's platform, journalist [[Sheldon Richman]] argues that humans are "active agents" and can change their behavior. He contends that people are capable of solving the problems facing Earth. <ref name="CNN Technology"/> [[Alan Weisman]], author of ''[[The World Without Us]]'', suggests a limit of one child per family as a preferable alternative to abstinence from reproduction. <ref name=maclean/> . 

[[Katharine Mieszkowski]] of [[Salon.com]] recommends that childless people adopt VHEMT's arguments when facing "probing questions" about their childlessness. <ref name=sdc>{{cite news|last=Mieszkowski|first=Katharine|title=No need to breed?|url=http://www.salon.com/2005/11/16/human_extinction/singleton/|accessdate=January 7, 2012|newspaper=Salon.com|date=November 16, 2005}}</ref> Writing in the ''Journal for Critical Animal Studies'', Carmen Dell'Aversano notes that VHEMT seeks to renounce children as a symbol of perpetual human progress. She casts the movement as a form of "queer oppositional politics" because it rejects perpetual reproduction as a form of motivation. She argues that the movement seeks to come to a new definition of "civil order", as [[Lee Edelman]] suggested that [[queer theory]] should. Dell'Aversano believes that VHEMT fulfills Edelman's mandate because they embody the [[death drive]] rather than ideas that focus on the reproduction of the past. <ref name=da>

Although Knight's organization has been featured in a book titled ''[[Donna Kossy#Kooks (1994)|Kooks: A Guide to the Outer Limits of Human Belief]]'',<ref name=te/> ''The Guardian'' journalist [[Oliver Burkeman]] notes that in a phone conversation Knight seems "rather sane and self-deprecating". <ref name=tg>{{cite news|last=Burkeman|first=Oliver|title=Climate change: calling planet birth|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/feb/13/climate-change-family-size-babies|accessdate=January 7, 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=February 12, 2010}}</ref> Weisman echoes this sentiment, characterizing Knight as "thoughtful, soft-spoken, articulate, and quite serious". <ref name=spiked1>{{cite news|last=Appleton|first=Josie|title=Unleashing nature’s terror|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/reviewofbooks_printable/3628/|accessdate=March 9, 2012|newspaper=Spiked|date=July 20, 2007}}</ref> Philosophers [[Steven Best]] and [[Douglas Kellner]] view VHEMT's stance as extreme, but they note that the movement formed in response to extreme stances found in "modern humanism".{{sfn|Best|Kellner|2001|p=268–9}} .
