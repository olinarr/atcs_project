'''Asylum shopping''' is a practice by [[Refugee|asylum seekers]] of applying for [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in several states or seeking to apply in a particular state after transiting other states. The phrase is used mostly in the context of the [[European Union]] and the [[Schengen area]], but has been used by the [[Federal Court of Canada]]. <ref>http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/A/AsylumShopping.aspx</ref> The term is controversial as it implies an abuse of the asylum process. <ref>http://emn.sarenet.es/Glossary/viewTerm.do?startingWith=A&id=17</ref> . 

One of the objectives of [[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters]] is to prevent asylum shopping. <ref>''[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldselect/ldeucom/84/8407.htm#n35 Select Committee on European Union Tenth Report]'', House of Lords</ref> The [[Dublin Convention]] stipulates that an asylum seeker is returned to the country where they first entered the [[Schengen area]]. Another objective of this policy is to prevent ''asylum seeker in orbit'', where an asylum seeker is transferred between states, none of which is willing to accept the application. <ref>http://www.irishrefugeecouncil.ie/factsheets/dublinconvention4.html</ref> .
