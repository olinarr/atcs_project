'''Refugee [[roulette]]''' refers to arbitrariness in the process of [[refugee]] status determinations or, as it is called in the [[United States]], [[Right of asylum|asylum]] adjudication.  Recent research suggests that at least in the United States and [[Canada]], the outcome of asylum determinations depends in large part on the identity of the particular adjudicator to whom an application is randomly assigned, and that the resulting disparities in rates of granting asylum are problematic. <ref>Jaya Ramji-Nogales, Andrew I. Schoenholtz, and Philip G. Schrag, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=983946 Refugee Roulette: Disparities in Asylum Adjudication], 60 Stan. L.

The original study that coined the term "refugee roulette" presents an empirical analysis of decision-making at all four levels of the asylum process, namely the asylum office of the [[Department of homeland security|Department of Homeland Security]], [[Executive Office for Immigration Review|the immigration courts]] of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], the [[Board of immigration appeals|Board of Immigration Appeals]], and the [[United States court of appeals|United States Courts of Appeals]], between 2000 and 2004. <ref>Jaya Ramji-Nogales, Andrew I. Schoenholtz, and Philip G. Schrag, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=983946 Refugee Roulette: Disparities in Asylum Adjudication], 60 Stan. L. Rev. 295 (2007); Jaya Ramji-Nogales, Andrew I. Schoenholtz, and Philip G. Schrag, [http://www.nyupress.org/books/Refugee_Roulette-products_id-11110.html Refugee Roulette: Disparities in Asylum Adjudication and Proposals for Reform] (NYU Press 2009). </ref>  The authors argue that their findings reveal an unacceptable level of disparities in grant rates, noting that the asylum adjudicators studied heard large numbers of cases from the same country in the same location over the same period of time.  The study concludes with recommendations for reforming the immigration adjudication system.  In a 2008 study of immigration court decision-making between 1994 and 2007, the United States [[Government accountability office|Government Accountability Office]] found that "the likelihood of being granted asylum varied considerably across and within the [immigration courts studied]."<ref>Government Accountability Office, [http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08940.pdf U.S. Asylum System: Significant Variation Existed in Asylum Outcomes across Immigration Courts and Judges] (2008)</ref>  .
