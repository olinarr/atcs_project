'''''Negusie v. Holder''''' (formerly ''Negusie v. Mukasey''), [[Case citation|555 U.S. 511]] (2009), was a legal case in which the [[United States Supreme Court]] agreed to review the issue whether the bar to [[asylum in the United States]] for persecutors applies to asylum applicants who have been the target of credible threats of harm or torture in their home countries if they refuse to further participate in the acts of persecution. At issue is whether Daniel Negusie, who says he was forced to assist in the mistreatment of prisoners in [[Eritrea]] under threat of execution, may nonetheless apply for asylum because any assistance he rendered was provided under [[duress]].  . 

The court held that the BIA and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] erred when they evaluated Negusie's asylum petition because they presumed it mandatory that an alien's coercion to persecute was immaterial when determining whether the "persecutor bar" applies.  .
