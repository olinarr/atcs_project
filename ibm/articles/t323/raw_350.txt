The '''asylum in the [[European Union]] (EU)''' was formed since a half-century in its Member States by application of the [[Geneva Convention]] of 28 July 1951 on the Status of [[Refugees]]. It evolved as a result of common policies appearing in the 1990s in connection with the creation of the [[Schengen Agreement]] on the suppression of internal borders. The EU has set up a common policy on asylum so that unsuccessful asylum seekers do not make a new application in another country . This common policy began with the [[Dublin Convention]] in 1990. It continued through the implementation of [[Eurodac]] and the [[Dublin Regulation]] in 2003, and continues today (October 2009 adoption of two proposals by the [[European Commission]]. <ref>[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/09/1552&format=HTML&aged=0&language=FR&guiLanguage=en A single asylum procedure and equitable to establish a uniform status valid throughout the European Union: the final building blocks of international protection are asked], Brussels, October 21, 2009 (press release Europa.eu)</ref> . 

== Outsourcing asylum ==. 
The outsourcing of asylum is a type of migration policies pursued by the countries of the [[European Union]] consisting of relocating the reception and accommodation of asylum seekers and the processing of their asylumapplications, in places near the borders of the EU or in countries outside the EU, from which asylum seekers originate or through which they pass. After an attempted relocation of asylum procedures in centers on the boundaries of the EU, in 2003 these policies have resulted in a proliferation of exiled camps in and around the European Union, a pressure on neighboring countries to develop systems that consider applications for asylum in their territories, and a radicalization of antimigratory policies in neighboring countries and within the border of the European Union. <ref>VALLUY Jerome [http://www.reseau-terra.eu/article876.html Rejection of exiles - The great reversal of the right of asylum], 2009</ref> . 

== Asylum shopping==. 
In the jargon of European institutions, asylum shopping is the practice of refugees wanting to choose a country other than that prescribed by the regulations to apply for political asylum, in order to choose the one which will offer the best reception conditions, or to lodge an application in another country after being dismissed. This expression is used to treat certain asylum seekers in analogy with consumers of welfare provisions<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldselect/ ldeucom/84/8407.htm # n35 Select Committee on European Union Tenth Report],''[[House of Lords]]</ref>). Such definition appears in official documents, newspaper articles, analysis, etc.. The asylum shopping is practiced by 12% of asylum seekers, according to former [[European Commissioner for Justice]] [[Franco Frattini]]. <ref>[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0, 2144,2579627,00.html Article by Deutsche Welle]</ref> . 

== Differences between Member States ==. 
The differences between the laws of different Member States are the main cause of the desire of refugees to choose their host country; in fact some states give refugee status to the majority of applicants, while others give it to less than 1%. The [[Dublin Regulation]] enables a state to return an asylum seeker in the first Member State where he transited (so-called ''readmission''). This provision was put in place to put pressure on border states, so that they better exercise control on the external borders of the EU. The effect of this measure is a greater number of asylum applications in the border states (like [[Greece]], [[Slovakia]], [[Poland]] or [[Malta]]) and in some cases, the expulsion of asylum applicants in neighboring countries such as [[Ukraine]],<ref>According to [[Amnesty International]], Ukraine is not a safe country of asylum: [http://www.amnestyinternational.be/doc/IMG/article_PDF/article13114.pdf] The [[UNHCR]] also asks not to return asylum seekers to Ukraine</ref> [[Turkey]] or [[Russia]] where the system of recognition of refugee status is often faulty. The [[UNHCR]] has recently asked the [[European Union]] not to return [[Iraq]]i asylum seekers to [[Greece]]. <ref>The Independent, London, June 17, 2008</ref> . 

== Restrictive Legislation ==. 
Ostensibly to fight against fraud, most European states have engaged in restrictive policies, like the [[United Kingdom]] ([[UK Borders Act]] of 2007, etc..), The [[Netherlands]], who have passed the Aliens Act in April 2001, [[Italy]], with the Bossi-Fini Act of July 2002, or [[France]], with different Acts (French Law of July 24, 2006 on immigration and integration, and French Law of 20 November 2007 on the control of immigration, integration and asylum). These measures have reduced the number of asylum seekers having been awarded the status of Refugee. <ref>[http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/dossiers/refugees/asylum-ue.shtml French documentation,''Asylum in the European Union'']</ref> . 

As part of the adoption on first reading of four [[codecision]] acts, between 4 and 7 May 2009, MEPs voted on {{date | 7 | May | 2009}} the ''asylum package''. <ref name=PA>[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/022-55223-124-05-19-902-20090506IPR55222-04-05-2009-2009-true/default_fr.htm Asylum policy: Parliament wants to introduce new rules], press release of the European Parliament, 7 May 2009</ref> This includes a proposed revision of the "reception" directive and another proposal to improve the [[Dublin Regulation|Dublin system]]. The Commission also proposes to revise the regulations [[Eurodac]] (biometric database) and create a [[European Asylum Support Office]], partially financed by funds previously granted to the [[European Fund for Refugees]], which will be responsible for assisting Member States in the management of asylum applications.  .
