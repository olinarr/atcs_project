{{History of Italy}} . 

The '''Years of Lead''' was a period of socio-political turmoil in [[Italy]] that lasted from the late 1960s into the early 1980s. This period was marked by a wave of [[terrorism]], initially called "Opposing Extremisms"{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} (''Opposti Estremismi'') <!-- please correct English translation of Italian as needed--> and later renamed as the "Years of Lead" (''Anni di piombo''). Among the possible origins of the name are a reference to the vast number of bullets fired,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3372239.stm | work=BBC News | first=Kathryn | last=Westcott | title=Italy's history of terror | date=January 6, 2004}}</ref> or the 1981 film ''[[Marianne and Juliane]]'' by Margarethe von Trotta, of which Italian title is ''Anni di piombo''. <ref>[http://www.brigaterosse.org/brigaterosse/Arte/cinema/AnniDiPiombo.htm ''Anni di piombo'' film review] {{it icon}}</ref> . 

There was widespread social conflict and unprecedented acts of terrorism carried out by both right- and left-wing paramilitary groups. An attempt to integrate the [[neo-fascist]] [[Italian Social Movement]] (MSI) into the [[Fernando Tambroni|Tambroni]] government led to rioting and was short-lived. The [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]] (DC) were instrumental in the [[Italian Socialist Party|Socialist party]] gaining power in the 1960s and they created a coalition. [[Kidnapping of Aldo Moro|The assassination]] of the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democratic]] (DC) leader [[Aldo Moro]] in 1978 ended the strategy of ''[[historic compromise]]'' between the DC and the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI). The assassination was carried out by the [[Red Brigades]], then led by [[Mario Moretti]]. Between 1969 and 1981, nearly 2,000 murders were attributed to political violence in the form of bombings, assassinations, and street warfare between rival militant factions. Although political violence has decreased substantially in Italy since that time, instances of sporadic violent crimes continue because of the re-emergence of [[anti-immigrant]], [[neo-fascist]], and [[militant]] [[Communism|communist]] groups.  . 

The [[left-wing]] [[autonomist movement]] lasted from 1968 until the end of the 1970s. The "years of lead" began with the shooting death of Antonio Annarumma in 1969 and the [[Piazza Fontana bombing]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. These events are attributed to the far-right, the far-left, and the secret services, depending on the source.  . 

== The "Strategy of Tension" theory ==. 
Many aspects of the "years of lead" are still shrouded in mystery and debate about them continues. There were many, especially on the left, who spoke of the existence in those years of a [[strategy of tension]] (''strategia della tensione''){{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. According to this theory, occult and foreign forces were involved in creating a "strategy of tension". Identified organizations included: [[Gladio]], a [[NATO]] secret anti-communist structure; the [[Propaganda Due|P2 masonic lodge]], discovered in 1981 following the arrest of its leader [[Licio Gelli]]; fascist "black terrorism" organizations such as ''[[Ordine Nuovo]]'' or [[National Vanguard (Italy)|''Avanguardia Nazionale'']]; [[SISMI|Italian secret service]]; and the United States.  . 

Despite repeated denials of its authenticity the existence of several copies of [[US Army Field Manual 30-31B]], some of them found in possession of key figure of pro-U.S. and far-right eversive figures (such as [[Licio Gelli]]), are hard to discount as fabrications.  . 

This theory re-emerged in the 1990s, following Prime Minister [[Giulio Andreotti]]'s recognition of the existence of Gladio before the Parliamentary assembly on 24 October 1990{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. Juridical investigations into the Piazza Fontana bombing and the Bologna massacre and several parliamentary reports pointed towards such a deliberate strategy of tension. Milan prosecutor [[Guido Salvini]] indicted a U.S. Navy officer, [[David Carrett]], for his role in the Piazza Fontana bombing. He also surprised Carlo Rocchi, a CIA operative in Italy, in 1995 while searching for information concerning the case in the mid-1990s.  . 

In 2000, a Parliamentary Commission report from the [[Olive Tree]], a left-of-center coalition, concluded that the strategy of tension had been supported by the United States to ''"stop the PCI, and to a certain degree also the PSI, from reaching executive power in the country".''<ref>{{it icon}} {{cite web | title=Commissione parlamentare d'inchiesta sul terrorismo in Italia e sulle cause della mancata individuazione dei responsabili delle stragi (1995 Parliamentary Commission of Investigation on Terrorism in Italy and on the Causes of the Failing of the Arrests of the Responsibles of the Bombings) | year=1995 | accessdate=2006-05-02 | url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/documents/collection_gladio/report_ital_senate.pdf |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060819211212/http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/documents/collection_gladio/report_ital_senate.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-08-19}}</ref><ref name="Fontana">{{it icon}} {{Cite news | title=Strage di Piazza Fontana – spunta un agente Usa | date=February 11, 1998 | accessdate=2006-05-02 | publisher=[[La Repubblica]] | url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/fatti/fontana/fontana/fontana.html}} (With links to juridical sentences and Parliamentary Report by the Italian Commission on Terrorism)</ref><ref name="Docs">{{en icon}}/{{it icon}}/{{fr icon}}/{{de icon}} {{cite web | title=Secret Warfare: Operation Gladio and NATO's Stay-Behind Armies | accessdate=2006-05-02 | publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Technology / International Relation and Security Network | url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/collections/coll_gladio.htm#Documents |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060425182721/http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/collections/coll_gladio.htm#Documents <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-04-25}}</ref> . 

On May 4, 2007 the Italian Parliament declared May 9 as a memorial day dedicated to the victims of terrorism. <ref>http://www.cedost.it/testi/legge_9_maggio.htm</ref> . 

== Asylum ==. 
=== France ===. 
The [[Mitterrand doctrine]], which was established in 1985 by [[François Mitterrand]], stated that Italian far-left terrorists who fled to France and who were convicted of violent acts in Italy, excluding "active, actual, bloody terrorism" during the "Years of Lead", would receive asylum and would not be subject to [[extradited|extradition]] to Italy. They would be integrated into French society.  . 

The act was announce on April 21, 1985, at the 65th Congress of the [[Ligue des droits de l'homme|Human Rights League]] (LDH), stating that Italian criminals who had given up their violent pasts and had fled to France would be protected from extradition to Italy: . 

{{bquote|Italian refugees... who took part in terrorist action before 1981... have broken links with the infernal machine in which they participated, have begun a second phase of their lives, have integrated into French society... I told the Italian government that they were safe from any sanction by the means of extradition. <ref>''Les réfugiés italiens (...) qui ont participé à l'action terroriste avant 1981 (...) ont rompu avec la machine infernale dans laquelle ils s'étaient engagés, ont abordé une deuxième phase de leur propre vie, se sont inséré dans la société française (...). J'ai dit au gouvernement italien qu'ils étaient à l'abri de toute sanction par voie d'extradition (...). </ref>}} . 

=== Nicaragua ===. 
Some Italian far left activists found political asylum in [[Nicaragua]], including [[Alessio Casimirri]], who took part in the [[assassination of Aldo Moro|kidnapping of Aldo Moro]].  . 

== Chronology ==. 
=== 1969 ===. 
==== Public protests ====. 
Public protests shook Italy during 1969, with the [[autonomist]] student movement particularly active, leading to the [[factory occupation|occupation]] of the [[Fiat]] automobile factory in [[Milan]]. [[Mario Capanna]] of the [[New Left]] movement, was prominent at the time, along with members of ''[[Potere Operaio]]'' and ''[[Autonomia Operaia]]'' ([[Antonio Negri]], [[Oreste Scalzone]], [[Franco Piperno]]), and ''[[Lotta Continua]]'' ([[Adriano Sofri]]).  . 

==== Death of Antonio Annarumma ====. 
On November 19, 1969, [[Antonio Annarumma]], a Milanese policeman, was assassinated during a riot of far-left demonstrators. <ref>http://www.cadutipolizia.it/fonti/1943 1981/1969annarumma.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cadutipolizia.it/articoli2007/conseguenza.htm |title=Nessuna Conseguenza – La Morte di Antonio Annarumma |publisher=Cadutipolizia.it |date= |accessdate=2010-05-05}}</ref> He was the first public official to die in the ensuing wave of violence referred to as "The Years of Bullets".  . 

==== Piazza Fontana bombing ====. 
{{Main|Piazza Fontana bombing}}
The Monument to [[Victor Emmanuel II]], the ''[[Banca Nazionale del Lavoro]]'' in Rome and the ''[[Banca Commerciale Italiana]]'' and the ''[[Piazza Fontana bombing|Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura]]'' in [[Milan]] were bombed in December.  . 

Local police arrested 80 or so suspects from left-wing groups, including [[Giuseppe Pinelli]], an anarchist initially blamed for the bombing, and [[Pietro Valpreda]]. Their guilt was denied by left-wing members, especially by members of the [[student movement]], then prominent in Milan's universities, as they believed that the bombing was carried out by fascists. Following the death of Giuseppe Pinelli, who "accidentally fell out of a window" on December 15 while in police custody, the radical left-wing newspaper ''Lotta Continua'' started a campaign accusing police officer [[Luigi Calabresi]] of Pinelli's murder.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The accusation of  wrongful death at the hands of the police was eventually determined to be false by the state, but only after many years of investigation.  . 

Meanwhile, the anarchist Valpreda and five others were convicted and jailed for the bombing. They were later released after three years of [[preventive detention]]. Over a 36-year period, numerous suspects were investigated, with no convictions.  The identity of the perpetrators remains unknown to this day.  . 

The [[Red Brigades]], the most prominent far-left terrorist organization, conducted a secret internal investigation that paralleled the official inquiry. <ref>[[:it:Inchieste di Robbiano di Mediglia]] Inquiry of the Red Brigades in Italy Wikipedia</ref> They ordered that the inquiry remain secret, because of the unfavorable light that it could shed on other terrorist organizations. The inquiry was discovered after a fire-fight between Red Brigade forces and [[Carabinieri|Italian police]] (carabinieri) at Robbiano di Mediglia in October 1974. The cover-up was exposed in 2000, by President Giovanni Pellegrino. <ref>[[:it:Commissione Stragi]] "Commissione Stragi" in Italy Wikipedia</ref> . 

=== 1970 ===. 
==== The ''Golpe Borghese'' ====. 
In December, a neo-fascist coup, dubbed the ''[[Golpe Borghese]]'', was planned by several far-right leaders and supported by members of the ''[[Corpo Forestale dello Stato]]'', along with the right-aligned entrepreneurs and industrialists. The "Black Prince", [[Junio Valerio Borghese]], took part in it. The coup, called off at the last moment, was discovered by the press, and publicly released a few months later.  . 

=== 1971 ===. 
==== Assassination of Alessandro Floris ====. 
On March 26, 1971 [[Alessandro Floris]] was assassinated in Genoa, by a unit of the [[Gruppo XXII Ottobre]], a far-left terrorist organization. An amateur photographer had taken a photo of the killer that enabled police to identify the terrorists. The group was investigated and more members arrested. Some fled to Milan and joined the "[[Gruppi di Azione Partigiana]]" (GAP) and later the Red Brigades. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vittimeterrorismo.it/memorie/schede/floris.htm |title=Alessandro Floris – Associazione Vittime del Terrorismo |publisher=Vittimeterrorismo.it |date=1939-10-21 |accessdate=2010-05-05}}</ref> . 

The Red Brigade considered the group Gruppo XXII Ottobre its predecessor and in April 1974, it kidnapped Judge [[Mario Sossi]] in an effort to free the arrested member. The effort was unsuccessful. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archivio900.it/it/nomi/nom.aspx?id=1462 |title=Mario Sossi − |publisher=Archivio900.it |date= |accessdate=2010-05-05}}</ref> Years later, the Red Brigade killed the judge  Francesco Coco on June 8, 1976 out of revenge, along with his two police escorts, [[Giovanni Saponara]] and [[Antioco Deiana]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vittimeterrorismo.it/memorie/schede/coco.htm |title=Francesco Coco – Associazione Vittime del Terrorismo |publisher=Vittimeterrorismo.it |date= |accessdate=2010-05-05}}</ref> . 

=== 1972 ===. 
==== Assassination of Luigi Calabresi ====. 
On May 17, 1972, police officer Luigi Calabresi, recipient of the gold medal of the Italian Republic for civil valor, was assassinated in Milan. Authorities initially focused on suspects in ''Lotta Continua'', before detaining two neo-fascist activists, Gianni Nardi and Bruno Stefano, along with the [[Germans|German]] Gudrun Kiess, in 1974. They were ultimately released. Sixteen years later, [[Adriano Sofri]], [[Giorgio Petrostefani]], [[Ovidio Bompressi]], and [[Leonardo Marino]] were arrested in Milan for confessing to the murder by Leonardo Marin. Their highly controversial trial finally established their guilt in the organizing and carrying out the murder. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vittimeterrorismo.it/memorie/schede/calabresi.htm |title=Luigi Calabresi – Associazione Vittime del Terrorismo |publisher=Vittimeterrorismo.it |date= |accessdate=2010-05-05}}</ref> . 

==== Peteano bombing ====. 
On May 31, 1972, three Italian police were killed in [[Peteano]] in a bombing, blamed on ''Lotta Continua''. Officers of the carabinieri were later indicted and convicted for manipulating the investigation in false directions. <ref name=Ginzburg>[[Carlo Ginzburg]], ''The Judge and the Historian. Marginal Notes and a Late-Twentieth-century Miscarriage of Justice'', London 1999, ISBN 1-85984-371-9. Original ed. 1991. </ref> Judge Casson identified ''Ordine Nuovo'' member [[Vincenzo Vinciguerra]] as the culprit who had planted the Peteano bomb.  . 

The neo-fascist terrorist Vincenzo Vinciguerra, arrested in the 1980s for the bombing in [[Peteano]], declared to magistrate [[Felice Casson]] that this [[false flag]] attack had been intended to force the Italian state to declare a [[state of emergency]] and to become more [[authoritarian]]. Vinciguerra explained how the [[SISMI]] military intelligence agency had protected him, allowing him to escape to [[Spain under Franco|Franquist Spain]].  . 

Casson's investigation revealed that the right-wing organization ''Ordine Nuovo'' had collaborated with the Italian Military Secret Service, [[Servizio Informazioni Difesa|SID]] (Servizio Informazioni Difesa). Together, they had engineered the Peteano terror and then wrongly blamed the militant extreme Italian left, the Red Brigades. He confessed and testified that he had been covered by an entire network of sympathizers in Italy and abroad who had ensured that after the attack he could escape. "A whole mechanism came into action", Vinciguerra recalled, "that is, the Carabinieri, the Minister of the Interior, the customs services and the military and civilian intelligence services accepted the ideological reasoning behind the attack." <ref>Daniele Ganser, ''NATO's Secret Armies.

=== 1973 ===. 
==== The Primavalle Fire ====. 
{{Main|Primavalle Fire}}
An April 16, 1973 attack by members of [[Potere Operaio]] on the house of neo-fascist MSI militant Mario Mattei resulted in his two sons, ages 20 and 8, being burned alive.  . 

==== Milan Police command (Questura di Milano) bombing ====. 
During a 17 May 1973 ceremony honoring Luigi Calabresi, in which the Interior Minister was present, [[Gianfranco Bertoli]], an [[anarchist]], threw a bomb that killed four and injured 45.  . 

In 1990, it was discovered that Bertoli, who had been convicted of the bombing, was an SID informant and member of Gladio. The secret services claimed that this was only a coincidence. A magistrate investigating the assassination attempt of Mariano Rumor found that Bertoli's files were incomplete. <ref name="Ginzburg"/> General [[:it:Gianadelio Maletti|Gianadelio Maletti<nowiki></nowiki>]], head of the SID from 1971 to 1975, was convicted ''in absentia'' in 1990 for obstruction of justice in the Mariano Rumor case.  .

==== Piazza della Loggia bombing ====. 
{{Main|Piazza della Loggia bombing}}
In May 1974, a bomb exploded during an anti-fascist demonstration in [[Brescia]], killing eight and wounding over 90. In 2005, the Court of Cessation issued an arrest warrant against [[Delfo Zorzi]], a former ''Ordine Nuovo'' member currently living in Japan.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} . 

==== Attempted neo-fascist coup ====. 
Count [[Edgardo Sogno]] revealed in his memoirs that in July 1974, he visited the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) station chief in Rome to inform him of preparations for a neo-fascist coup. Asking what the United States (US) government would do in case of such a coup, Sogno wrote that he was told, "the United States would have supported any initiative tending to keep the communists out of government." General Maletti declared, in 2001, that he had not known about Sogno's relationship with the CIA and had not been informed about the coup, known as ''[[Golpe bianco]]'' (White Coup), led by [[Randolfo Pacciardi]]. <ref name="WillanCIA">[[Philip Willan]], ''[[The Guardian]]'', March 26, 2001.

On August 4, 1974, 12 died and 105 were injured in the bombing of the train [[Italicus Expressen|Italicus Roma-Brennero express]] at San Benedetto Val di Sambro.  . 

==== Arrest of Vito Miceli ====. 
General [[Vito Miceli]], chief of the [[SIOS]] military intelligence agency in 1969, and head of the [[SISMI|SID]] from 1970 to 1974, was arrested in 1974 on charges of "conspiracy against the state."{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Following his arrest, the Italian secret services were reorganized by a 24 October 1977 law in an attempt to reassert civilian control over the intelligence agencies. The SID was divided into the current [[SISMI]], the [[SISDE]], and the [[CESIS]], which was to directly coordinate with the [[Prime Minister of Italy]]. An [[Italian Parliamentary Committee on Secret services control]] (Copaco) was created at the same time{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.  . 

==== Arrest of Red Brigade leaders ====. 
In 1974, some leaders of the Red Brigades, including [[Renato Curcio]] and Alberto Franceschini, were arrested, but new leadership continued the war against the Italian right-wing establishment with increased fervor{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.  . 

The year before, ''[[Potere Operaio]]'' had disbanded, although ''[[Autonomia Operaia]]'' carried on in its wake. ''Lotta Continua'' also dissolved in 1976, although the magazine struggled on for several years. From remnants of ''Lotta Continua'' and similar groups, the terror organization ''[[Prima Linea]]'' emerged.  . 

=== 1976 ===. 
==== Prima Linea: an emerging terrorist organization ====. 
On April 29, 1976, [[Enrico Pedenovi]] was killed in Milan by the organization ''[[Prima Linea]]''. This was the first assassination conducted by ''Prima Linea''. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vittimeterrorismo.it/memorie/schede/pedenovi.htm |title=Enrico Pedenovi – Associazione Vittime del Terrorismo |publisher=Vittimeterrorismo.it |date= |accessdate=2010-05-05}}</ref> .

On May 14, in Milan, some activists from a far-left organization pulled out their pistols and began to fire on the police, killing policeman [[Antonio Custra]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vittimeterrorismo.it/memorie/schede/custra.htm |title=Antonio Custra – Associazione Vittime del Terrorismo |publisher=Vittimeterrorismo.it |date= |accessdate=2010-05-05}}</ref> A photographer took a photo of an activist shooting at the police. This year was called the time of the "P38", referring to the [[Walther P38]] pistol.  . 

=== 1978 ===. 
==== Kidnapping and assassination of Aldo Moro ====. 
{{main|Kidnapping of Aldo Moro}}
On March 16,  Aldo Moro was kidnapped by the [[Red Brigades]], and five of his bodyguards killed. The Red Brigades were a militant leftist group, then led by [[Mario Moretti]]. Aldo Moro was a left-leaning Christian Democrat who served several times as Prime Minister. Before his murder he was trying to include the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI), headed by [[Enrico Berlinguer]], in the government through a deal called the ''[[Historic Compromise]]''. The PCI was the largest communist party in western Europe. This was largely because of its non-extremist and pragmatic stance, its growing independence from Moscow and its new [[eurocommunism|eurocommunist]] doctrine. The PCI was especially strong in areas such as [[Emilia Romagna]], where it had stable government positions and mature practical experience, which may have contributed to a more pragmatic approach to politics. The Red Brigades were fiercely opposed by the Communist Party and [[trade union]]s, a few left-wing politicians even used the condescending expression "comrades who do wrong" (''Compagni che sbagliano''). The circumstances surrounding Aldo Moro's murder have never been made clear, but the consequences included that fact that PCI did not gain executive power.  . 

Investigative journalist [[Carmine Pecorelli]] was assassinated on March 20, 1979. In a May 1978 article, he had drawn connections between Aldo Moro's kidnapping and Gladio. <ref name="Pecorelli">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,4665179-105806,00.html Moro's ghost haunts political life], ''[[The Guardian]]'', May 9, 2003</ref>  . 

Moro's assassination was followed by a large clampdown on the social movement, including the arrest of many members of ''[[Autonomia Operaia]]'', including, [[Oreste Scalzone]] and political philosopher [[Toni Negri]].  .
