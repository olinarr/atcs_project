'''Immigration and crime''' refers to perceived or actual relationships between [[crime]] and [[immigration]].  . 

==Worldwide==. 
''The Handbook of Crime Correlates'' (2009), a review of studies of correlates with crime, states that most studies on immigrants have found higher rates of crime. However, this varies greatly depending on the country of origin with immigrants from some regions having lower crime rates than the indigenous population. <ref name=Ellis2009>Handbook of Crime Correlates; Lee Ellis, Kevin M. Beaver, John Wright; 2009; Academic Press</ref> . 

==Europe==.

A "new anti-immigrant" movement has become apparent in some European countries, especially the Netherlands, Scandinavia, and Switzerland, during the early 21st century. The issue of immigrant crime plays an important role in the political debate in these countries. <ref>
"Crime, immigration and safety issues have dominated Dutch political debate for a decade, leading to measures such as imprisoning asylum seekers, outlawing psychedelic mushrooms, mandating citizenship classes for immigrants and forcing people to carry ID cards." [http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hkQ1wEg-F5uBMjGMKgxZPG1dRe_A?docId=632403dca8ff4b0a9d1eabaa9e3fe750 Associated Press, 18 November 2010]. 
"The Swiss vote highlights the tensions across Europe with foreign immigrants arriving from Africa and the Middle East. France recently made it easier to deport foreign criminals and has already deported thousands of Roma living in the country illegally. 
New anti-immigrant movements in Scandinavia, Austria and the Netherlands, where anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders has a hand in government, have garnered substantial voter support. 
In Switzerland, where more than a fifth of the 7.8 million inhabitants are foreigners, the far-right SVP has long played on fears of surging crime rates, the loss of traditional Swiss culture and the abuse of the generous welfare system by immigrants to raise support for its xenophobic initiatives."

===Sweden===. 
Immigrants are overrepresented in [[Sweden]]'s crime statistics. During the period 1997-2001, 25% of the almost 1,520,000 offences were committed by people born abroad, while almost 20% were committed by Swedish-born people with a foreign background.

===Switzerland===. 
{{further|Crime in Switzerland}}
In  [[Switzerland]], 69.7% of prison population had no Swiss citizenship, compared to 22.1% of total resident population (as of 2008). 
The figure of arrests by residence status is not usually made public. As in 1997 the conviction rate of Swiss citizens fell below 50% for the first time, a special report was compiled by the [[Federal Department of Justice and Police]] (published in 2001) which for the year 1998 found an arrest rate per 1000 adult population of 2.3 for Swiss citizens, 4.2 for legally resident aliens and 32 for asylum seekers. 
21% of arrests made concerned individuals with no residence status, who were thus either ''[[sans papiers]]'' or "crime tourists" without any permanent residence in Switzerland. <ref>[http://www.vimentis.ch/d/publikation/154/Ausl%E4nderkriminalit%E4t+in+der+Schweiz.html Ausländerkriminalität in der Schweiz]</ref> . 

The term ''{{lang|de|Ausländerkriminalität}}'' ("foreigner criminality") since the 1990s has become a politically charged term, with the populist "black sheep" campaign for the "initiative for the extradition of criminal foreigners" of the [[Swiss People's Party]] making international headlines in September 2007.  . 

In April 2010, the director of the Federal Office for Migration (BFM),  Alard du Bois-Reymond,  issued a statement on the large number of unfounded requests for asylum by nationals of [[Nigeria]] in particular. 
Du Bois-Reymond said that 99.5% of asylum seekers of Nigerian origin were abusing the asylum system, entering Switzerland  with the intention of pursuing petty crime and drug dealing. <ref>[http://www.drs.ch/www/de/drs/nachrichten/schweiz/183270.bund-will-asylmissbrauch-einen-riegel-schieben.html Task-Force gegen Asylmissbrauch] 11 April 2010. </ref>
The Nigerian ambassador to Switzerland, Martin Ihoeghian Uhomoibhi, objected to du Boi-Reymond's statement as an undue generalization. <ref>[http://www.bernerzeitung.ch/schweiz/standard/Nigerianischer-Botschafter-verlangt-Aussprache-mit-Schweizer-Bundesamtschef/story/28664526 Nigerianischer Botschafter verlangt Aussprache mit Schweizer Bundesamtschef] 29 April 2010. </ref> . 

===United Kingdom===. 
{{See also|Immigration to the United Kingdom since 1922|Race and crime in the United Kingdom}}
It was reported in 2007 that more than one-fifth of [[crime in London]] was committed by immigrants. <ref>Harper, Tom; Leapman, Ben. [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1563890/Foreigners-commit-fifth-of-crime-in-London.html "Foreigners 'commit fifth of crime in London'"]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. 23 September 2007. Accessed 21 September 2011. </ref> A 2008 study found that the crime rate of Eastern European immigrants was the same as that of the indigenous population. <ref>Johnston, Phillip. [http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/philipjohnston/3674251/Immigration_and_crime_the_real_results/ "Immigration and crime: the real results"]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. 16 April 2008. Accessed 21 September 2011. </ref> . 

==United States==. 
{{See also|Immigration to the United States#Crime|Race and crime in the United States}}
''The Handbook of Crime Correlates'' states that unlike studies outside the US, a majority of studies in the US have found lower crime rates among immigrants than among non-immigrants. Again, the country of origin may be more important than immigrant status itself. <ref name=Ellis2009/> . 

The [[Center for Immigration Studies]] in a 2009 report argued that "New government data indicate that immigrants have high rates of criminality, while older academic research found low rates. The overall picture of immigrants and crime remains confused due to a lack of good data and contrary information."<ref>Immigration and Crime Assessing a Conflicted Issue, Steven A. Camarota and Jessica M. Vaughan, November 2009, http://www.cis.org/articles/2009/crime.pdf</ref> This view is disputed by Tony Waters and others.[http://www.ethnography.com/2010/02/the-connection-between-crime-and-immigration-a-complicated-but-not-conflicted-issue/] who point out that some studies show that immigrants in the United States are often associated with lower levels of crime than native born.  .
