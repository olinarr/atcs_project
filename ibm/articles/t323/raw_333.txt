[[Immigration]] to the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] since 1922<ref>The name of the country was formally changed in 1927 from the ''United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland'' to ''United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'' by the [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927|Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act]]. However, the change had effectively taken place when the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] had established the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922, granting near-independence to 26 of the 32 counties of [[Ireland]]. </ref> has been substantial, in particular from [[Ireland]] and the former [[colony|colonies]] and other territories of the [[British Empire]] - such as [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Caribbean]], [[South Africa]], [[Kenya]] and [[Hong Kong]] - under [[British nationality law]]. Others have come as [[asylum seekers]], seeking protection as [[refugees]] under the [[United Nations]] [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 Refugee Convention]], or from [[European Union]] (EU) [[European Union member states|member states]], exercising one of the EU's [[Four Freedoms (European Union)|Four Freedoms]].  . 

About half the population increase between the [[United Kingdom Census 1991|1991]] and [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001]] [[census]]es was due to [[Foreign-born population of Great Britain, 2001|foreign-born]] immigration. 4.9 million people<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=1312 Foreign-born population] National Statistics Online, 24 October 2006. </ref> (8.3 percent of the population at the time) were born abroad, although the census gives no indication of their immigration status or intended length of stay.  . 

Provisional figures show that in 2009, 567,000 people arrived to live in the UK whilst 371,000 left, meaning that net inward migration was 196,000. The number of people immigrating to and emigrating from the UK both fell between 2008 and 2009. <ref name="2009 migration">{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11094468|title=Net migration to UK rose in 2009, statistics show|publisher=BBC News|date=26 August 2010|accessdate=28 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/ips-faq.pdf|title=Provisional estimates of long-term international migration, year ending December 2009: Frequently asked questions|publisher=Office for National Statistics|date=August 2010|accessdate=28 August 2010}}</ref> . 

In 2006, there were 149,035 applications for British citizenship, 32 percent fewer than in 2005. The number of people granted citizenship during 2006 was 154,095, 5 percent fewer than in 2005.

In comparison, migration to and from [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] has increased since 2004 with the [[Enlargement of the European Union|accession]] to the [[European Union]] of eight Central and Eastern European states, since there is [[Freedom of movement for workers|free movement of labour]] within the EU.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The UK government is currently phasing in a new [[Points-based immigration system (United Kingdom)|points-based immigration system]] for people from outside of the [[European Economic Area]].  . 

==British Empire and the Commonwealth==. 
From the mid-eighteenth century until at least 1947, and longer in many areas, the [[British Empire]] covered a large proportion of the globe and at its peak over a third of the world's people lived under British rule. Both during this time, and following the granting of independence to most colonies after [[Second World War]], the vast majority of immigrants to the UK were from either current or former colonies, most notably those in the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the [[Caribbean]].  . 

Following the end of the Second World War, the [[British Nationality Act 1948]] was passed to allow the 800 million<ref name="Turner"/> [[British subject|subjects]] in the British Empire to live and work in the United Kingdom without needing a visa. These people filled a gap in the UK [[labour market]] for unskilled jobs and many people were specifically brought to the UK on ships such as the ''[[Empire Windrush]]''.  . 

[[Commonwealth]] immigration, made up largely of [[economic migrants]], rose from 3,000 per year in 1953 to 46,800 in 1956 and 136,400 in 1961. <ref name="Turner">[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/westminster_hall/2003/mar/19/immigration#S6CV0401P0_20030319_WH_34 HC Deb 19 March 2003 vol 401 cc270-94WH.]</ref> The heavy numbers of migrants resulted in the establishment of a Cabinet committee in June 1950 to find "''ways which might be adopted to check the immigration into this country of [[Colored|coloured]] people from [[Crown colony|British colonial]] territories''". <ref name="Turner"/>  . 

Although the Committee recommended not to introduce restrictions, the [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962|Commonwealth Immigrants Act]] was passed in 1962 as a response to public sentiment that the new arrivals "should return to their own countries" and that "no more of them come to this country". <ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1965/feb/09/immigrants-to-united-kingdom#S5CV0706P0_19650209_HOC_64 HC Deb 09 February 1965 vol 706 cc178-82.]</ref> Introducing the legislation to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Secretary of State for the Home Department|Home Secretary]] [[Rab Butler]] stated that:  . 

{{Quotation|The justification for the control which is included in this Bill, which I shall describe in more detail in a few moments, is that a sizeable part of the entire population of the earth is at present legally entitled to come and stay in this already densely populated country.

The new Act required migrants to have a job before they arrived, to possess special skills or who would meet the "labour needs" of the national economy. In 1965, to combat the perceived injustice in the case where the wives of British subjects could not obtain British nationality, the [[British Nationality Act 1965|British Nationality Act]] was adopted. Shortly afterwards, refugees from [[Kenya]] and [[Uganda]], fearing discrimination from their own national governments, began to arrive in Britain; as they had retained their British nationality granted by the 1948 Act, they were not subject to the later controls. The Conservative MP [[Enoch Powell]] campaigned for tighter controls on immigration which resulted in the passing of the [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968|Commonwealth Immigrants Act]] in 1968. <ref name="NatArch">[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/commonwealth-immigration-control-legislation.htm The National Archives, "Commonwealth Immigration control and legislation".]</ref> . 

For the first time, the Act required migrants to have a "substantial connection with the United Kingdom", namely to be connected by birth or ancestry to a UK national. Those who did not could only obtain United Kingdom nationality at the discretion of the national authorities. <ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1968/feb/29/commonwealth-immigrants-bill-1#column_930 HL Deb 29 February 1968 vol 289 cc917-1217.]</ref> One month after the adoption of the Act, Enoch Powell made his infamous [[Rivers of Blood speech]].  . 

By 1972, with the passing of the [[Immigration Act 1971|Immigration Act]], only holders of [[work permit]]s, or people with parents or grandparents born in the UK could gain entry - effectively stemming [[primary immigration]] from Commonwealth countries. <ref name="Brah">{{cite book|last=Brah|first=Avtar|title=Cartographies of Diaspora: Contesting Identities|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=1996|page=37|url=http://books.google.com/?id=NaAzO-mE4BAC&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37&dq=end+of+primary+immigration | isbn=9780415121262}}</ref> The Act abolished the distinction between Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth entrants. The Conservative government nevertheless allowed, amid much controversy, the immigration of 27,000 individuals displaced from Uganda after the [[1971 Ugandan coup d'état|coup d'état]] led by [[Idi Amin]] in 1971. <ref name="NatArch"/>  . 

In the 1970s, an average of 72,000 immigrants were settling in the UK every year from the Commonwealth; this decreased in the 1980s and early 1990s to around 54,000 per year, only to rise again to around 97,000 by 1999. The total number of Commonwealth immigrants since 1962 is estimated at around 2.5 million. <ref>[http://migrationwatchuk.com/pdfs/History/6_1_History_of_immigration.pdf Migration Watch UK, "History of Immigration".]</ref> . 

The [[Ireland Act 1949]] has the unusual status of recognising the [[Republic of Ireland]], but affirming that its [[citizen]]s are not citizens of a foreign country for the purposes of any law in the United Kingdom. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1949/cukpga_19490041_en_1|title=Ireland Act 1949|date=2 June 1949|publisher=Office of Public Sector Information|accessdate=20 August 2010}}</ref> This act was initiated at a time when Ireland withdrew from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] after declaring itself a republic. <ref>{{cite book|last=Layton-Henry|first=Zig|chapter=Patterns of privilege: Citizenship rights in Britain|title=Citizenship in a Global World: Comparing Citizenship Rights for Aliens|editor-first=Atsushi|editor-last=Kondo|year=2001|location=Basingstoke|publisher=Palgrave|pages=116–135|isbn=0333802659}}</ref> . 

==World War II==. 
{{see|German migration to the United Kingdom}} . 

In the lead up to World War II, many [[Germany|German]]s, particularly those belonging to minorities which were persecuted under [[Nazi]] rule, such as [[Jew]]s, sought to emigrate to the United Kingdom,  and it is estimated that as many as 50,000 may have been successful. There were immigration caps on the number who could enter and, subsequently, some applicants were turned away. When the UK declared [[World War II|war on Germany]], however, migration between the countries ceased.  . 

==Post-war immigration (1945-1983)==. 
Following the end of [[World War II]], substantial groups of people from [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-controlled territories settled in Britain, particularly [[Polish British|Poles]] and [[Ukrainian British|Ukrainians]]. The UK recruited displaced people as so-called European Volunteer Workers in order to provide labour to industries that were required in order to aim economic recovery after the war. <ref>Diana Kay and Robert Miles (1998) [http://jrs.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/1/3-4/214 Refugees or migrant workers? The case of the European Volunteer Workers in Britain (1946–1951)], ''Journal of Refugee Studies'' 1(3-4), pp. 214-236</ref> In the 1951 census, the Polish-born population of the UK numbered some 162,339, up from 44,642 in 1931. <ref>Colin Holmes (1988) ''John Bull's Island: Immigration and British Society 1871-1971'', Basingstoke: Macmillan</ref><ref>Kathy Burrell (2002) [http://www.le.ac.uk/lahs/downloads/2002/burrell2002-3.pdf Migrant memories, migrant lives: Polish national identity in Leicester since 1945], ''Transactions of the Leicestershire Archaeological and Historical Society'' 76, pp. 59-77</ref> . 

[[British Indians|Indians]] began arriving in the UK in large numbers shortly after their country gained independence in 1947. More than 60,000 arrived before 1955, many of whom drove buses, or worked in [[foundry|foundries]] or [[textile]] factories.  Later arrivals opened [[corner shop]]s or ran [[post office]]s. The flow of Indian immigrants peaked between 1965 and 1972, boosted in particular by [[Idi Amin|Idi Amin's]] sudden decision to [[expulsion of Asians in Uganda in 1972|expel all 50,000]] [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] Indians from [[Uganda]]. Around 30,000 Ugandan Asians migrated to the UK. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/7/newsid_2492000/2492333.stm|title=1972: Asians given 90 days to leave Uganda|publisher=BBC On This Day|accessdate=2008-05-17 | date=7 August 1972}}</ref> . 

There was also an influx of refugees from [[Hungary]], following the crushing of the [[1956 Hungarian revolution]], numbering 20,990. <ref>UNHCR (2006) [http://www.unhcr.org/publ/PUBL/4523cb392.pdf 'A matter of the heart': How the Hungarian crisis changed the world of refugees], ''Refugees'' 114(3), pp. 4-11</ref> . 

Until the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, all [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] citizens could enter and stay in the United Kingdom without any restriction. The Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 made [[Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies|Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies]] (CUKCs) whose [[passport]]s were not directly issued by the United Kingdom Government  (i.e. passports issued by the Governor of a colony or by the Commander of a British [[protectorate]]) subject to immigration control.   . 

[[Enoch Powell]] gave the famous "[[Rivers of Blood]]" speech on 20 April 1968 in which he warned his audience of what he believed would be the consequences of continued unchecked immigration from the Commonwealth to Britain. Opposition Leader [[Edward Heath]] sacked Powell from his Shadow Cabinet the day after the speech, and he never held another senior political post. Powell received 110,000 letters- only 2,300 disapproving-<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=0ApWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=TeEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5334,5784764|newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard|date=22 December 1968|title=British Conservative Sees Foreign Influx as Threat|page=4A}}</ref> as a result of the speech and a Gallup poll at the end of April showed that 74% of those asked agreed with his speech.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} After the 'Rivers of Blood' speech, Powell was transformed into a national public figure and won huge support across Britain.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Three days after the speech, on 23 April, as the Race Relations Bill was being debated in the House of Commons, around 2,000 dockers walked off the job to march on Westminster protesting against Powell's dismissal,<ref>{{cite|url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=zudYAAAAIBAJ&sjid=A0sMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1643,7221622|title="We back Enoch" march by dockers; He is being victimised, they say|page=1|newspaper=Evening Times|date=23 April 1968}}</ref> and the next day 400 meat porters from Smithfield market handed in a 92-page petition in support of Powell. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=3Y8uAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EIoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1749,5257610|title=More Call For Britain To Shut Out Nonwhites|page=1|newspaper=Schenectady Gazette|date=25 April 1968}}</ref> . 

By 1972, only holders of [[work permit]]s, or people with parents or grandparents born in the UK could gain entry - significantly reducing [[primary immigration]] from Commonwealth countries. <ref name="Brah"/> . 

==Contemporary immigration (1983 onwards)==.

The [[British Nationality Act 1981]], which was enacted in 1983, distinguishes between British [[citizen]] or [[British Overseas Territories]] citizen. The former hold nationality ''by descent'' and the latter hold nationality ''other than by descent''. Citizens by descent cannot automatically pass on British nationality to a child born outside the United Kingdom or its Overseas Territories (though in some situations the child can be registered as a citizen).  . 

Immigration officers have to be satisfied about a person's nationality and identity and entry could be refused if they were not satisfied. <ref>[http://www.24dash.com/news/57/12221/index.htm Immigration staff can ask Muslim women to remove veils] 24dash.com, 26 October 2006</ref> . 

Non-European immigration rose significantly during the period from 1997, not least because of the government's abolition of the primary purpose rule in June 1997. <ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/news/06/0605/straw.shtml</ref> This change made it easier for UK residents to bring foreign spouses into the country.      . 

The former government advisor Andrew Neather in the ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]'' stated that the deliberate policy of ministers from late 2000 until early 2008 was to open up the UK to mass migration. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23760073-dont-listen-to-the-whingers---london-needs-immigrants.do |title=Don't listen to the whingers - London needs immigrants |first=Andrew |last=Neather |work=Evening Standard |location=London |date=23 October 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/6418456/Labour-wanted-mass-immigration-to-make-UK-more-multicultural-says-former-adviser.html |title=Labour wanted mass immigration to make UK more multicultural, says former adviser |first=Tom |last=Whitehead |work=Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=23 October 2009 |accessdate=2009-10-28}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> . 

===European Union===. 
One of the [[Four Freedoms (European Union)|Four Freedoms]] of the [[European Union]], of which the United Kingdom is a member, is the right to the free movement of people as codified in the [[Directive 2004/38/EC on the right to move and reside freely|Directive 2004/38/EC]] and the [[EEA Regulations (UK)]].  . 

Since the expansion of the [[European Union|EU]] on 1 May 2004, the UK has accepted immigrants from [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], [[Malta]] and [[Cyprus]], although the substantial Maltese and [[Greek Cypriots|Greek-]] and [[Turkish Cypriots|Turkish-Cypriot]] communities were established earlier through their Commonwealth connection.

Research conducted by the [[Migration Policy Institute]] for the [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] suggests that, between May 2004 and September 2009, 1.5 million workers migrated from the new EU member states to the UK, but that many have returned home, with the result that the number of nationals of the new member states in the UK increased by some 700,000 over the same period. <ref name="MPI">{{cite book|url=http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/uploaded_files/new_europeans.pdf|title=The UK's new Europeans: Progress and challenges five years after accession|last=Sumption|first=Madeleine|coauthors=Somerville, Will|date=January 2010|work=Equality and Human Rights Commission Policy Report|publisher=Equality and Human Rights Commission|page=13|accessdate=17 January 2010|isbn=9781842062524}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/jan/17/eastern-european-uk-migrants|title=Young, self-reliant, educated: portrait of UK's eastern European migrants|last=Doward|first=Jamie|coauthors=Rogers, Sam|date=17 January 2010|work=The Observer|accessdate=17 January 2010 | location=London}}</ref> Migration from Poland in particular has become temporary and circular in nature. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8243225.stm|title=Migrants to UK 'returning home'|date=2009-09-08|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-09-08}}</ref> In 2009, for the first time since the enlargement, more nationals of the eight Central and Eastern European states that joined the EU in 2004 left the UK than arrived. <ref name="A8 leaving">{{cite news|title=UK sees shift in migration trend|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/10174019.stm|accessdate=28 May 2010|date=27 May 2010|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> Research commissioned by the Regeneration and Economic Development Analysis Expert Panel suggested migrant workers leaving the UK due to the recession are likely to return in the future and cited evidence of "strong links between initial temporary migration and intended permanent migration". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/corporate/pdf/1854800.pdf|title=Impact of Economic Downturn and Immigration|author=Anne E.

The Government announced that the same rules would not apply to nationals of [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] (A2 nationals) when those countries acceded to the EU in 2007.

In February 2011, the [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]], [[Ed Miliband]], stated that he thought that the Labour government's decision to permit the unlimited immigration of eastern European migrants had been a mistake, arguing that they had underestimated the potential number of migrants and that the scale of migration had had a negative impact on wages. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/8353794/Labour-accused-of-covering-up-warnings-about-immigration.html|title=Labour accused of covering up warnings about immigration|date=1 March 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=12 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/video-miliband--immigration-hit-wages-2228320.html|title=Video: Miliband - 'Immigration hit wages'|date=28 February 2011|work=The Independent|accessdate=12 March 2011}}</ref> . 

A report by the [[Department for Communities and Local Government]] (DCLG) entitled ''International Migration and Rural Economies'', suggests that intra-EU migration since enlargement has resulted in migrants settling in rural locations without a prior history of immigration. It also notes that while, at the national level, "evidence so far suggests that it is unlikely that migration has had a significant impact on the wages or employment prospects of local workers...there is some evidence that suggests immigration has had a significant but small impact on wages of previous waves of lower-skilled migrant workers and that when the occupational structure of the UK workforce is taken into account, there is a negative impact on the wages of UK workers at the bottom of the occupational distribution". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/corporate/pdf/1854822.pdf|title=International Migration and Rural Economies|author=Experian Plc|publisher=Department for Communities and Local Government|date=March 2011|accessdate=12 March 2011}}</ref> Other research indicates that migration from the new EU member states may have helped improve labour market efficiency and hence increase average wages, although with a potentially small negative impact at the bottom of the income scale. <ref name="MPI"/> . 

Research published by [[University College London]] in July 2009 showed that EU migrants made a "substantial net contribution to the UK fiscal system", paying 37 per cent more in taxes than they received in welfare payments. However, "[[European Economic Area|EEA]] national(s) who are economically inactive, including A8 and A2 nationals will not generally be entitled to income-related benefits". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/www.direct.gov.uk/en/MoneyTaxAndBenefits/BenefitsTaxCreditsAndOtherSupport/BeginnersGuideToBenefits/DG_170638|date=27 Sep 2010|title=The National Archives: Directgov - Benefits for non-UK nationals|accessdate=12 March 2011}}</ref> Researchers found that, on average, A8 migrants were younger and better educated than the native population, and that if they had the same demographic characteristics of natives, would be 13 per cent less likely to claim benefits and 28 per cent less likely to live in [[social housing]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.ucl.ac.uk/cream/pages/CDP/CDP_18_09.pdf|title=Assessing the fiscal costs and benefits of A8 migration to the UK|last=Dustmann|first=Christian|coauthors=Frattini, Tommaso; Halls, Caroline|date=July 2009|work=CReAM Discussion Paper|publisher=Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration, Department of Economics, University College London|accessdate=2009-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Jack | last=Doyle | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=EU migrants 'good for UK economy' | date=24 July 2009 | publisher= | url =http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/eu-migrants-good-for-uk-economy-1759279.html | work =The Independent | pages = | accessdate = 2009-07-25 | language = | location=London}}</ref> . 

===Managed migration===. 
"Managed migration" is the term for all legal labour and student migration from outside of the European Union and this accounts for a substantial percentage of overall immigration figures for the UK. Many of the immigrants who arrive under these schemes bring skills which are in short supply in the UK. This area of immigration is managed by the [[UK Border Agency]], a department within the [[Home Office]]. Applications are made at UK embassies or consulates or directly to the UK Border Agency, depending upon the type of visa or permit required.  . 

In April 2006 changes to the managed migration system were proposed that would create one [[Points-based immigration system (United Kingdom)|points-based immigration system]] for the UK in place of all other schemes. Tier 1 in the new system - which replaced the [[Highly Skilled Migrant Programme]] - gives points for age, education, earning, previous UK experience but not for work experience. The points-based system was phased in over the course of 2008, replacing previous managed migration schemes such as the [[Work permit (United Kingdom)|work permit system]] and the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/managingborders/managingmigration/apointsbasedsystem/|title=The points-based system|publisher=Border & Immigration Agency|accessdate=2008-03-09}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/managingborders/managingmigration/apointsbasedsystem/timetableforPBSlaunch|title=Timetable for PBS launch|publisher=Border & Immigration Agency|accessdate=2008-03-09}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> . 

The points-based system is composed of five tiers, described by the UK Border Agency as follows:
*Tier 1 – for highly skilled individuals, who can contribute to growth and productivity;
*Tier 2 – for skilled workers with a job offer, to fill gaps in the United Kingdom workforce;
*Tier 3 – for limited numbers of low-skilled workers needed to fill temporary labour shortages;
*Tier 4 – for students;
*Tier 5 – for temporary workers and young people covered by the Youth Mobility Scheme, who are allowed to work in the United Kingdom for a limited time to satisfy primarily non-economic objectives. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/managingborders/managingmigration/apointsbasedsystem/howitworks|title=How the points-based system works|publisher=UK Border Agency|accessdate=6 February 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> . 

In June 2010, Britain's new [[United Kingdom coalition government (2010–present)|Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition government]] brought in a temporary cap on immigration of those entering the UK from outside the EU, with the limit set as 24,100, in order to stop an expected rush of applications before a permanent cap is imposed in April 2011. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9ab202a4-8299-11df-85ba-00144feabdc0.html|title=Tories begin consultation on cap for migrants|work=The Financial Times|first=James|last=Boxell|date=28 June 2010|accessdate=7 October 2010}}</ref> The cap has caused tension within the coalition, with business secretary [[Vince Cable]] arguing that it is harming British businesses. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/sep/17/vince-cable-migrant-cap-economy|title=Vince Cable: Migrant cap is hurting economy|agency=Press Association|work=The Guardian|date=17 September 2010|accessdate=7 October 2010}}</ref> Others have argued that the cap will have a negative impact on Britain's status as a centre for scientific research. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/oct/07/nobel-laureates-immigration-cap|title=Nobel laureates urge rethink over immigration cap|agency=Press Association|work=The Guardian|date=7 October 2010|accessdate=7 October 2010}}</ref> . 

For family relatives of [[European Economic Area]] nationals living in the UK, there is the [[EEA family permit]] which enables those family members to join their relatives already living and working in the UK.  . 

Though immigration is a matter that is reserved to the UK government under the [[Scotland Act 1998|legislation]] that established devolution for Scotland in 1999, the [[Scottish Government]] was able to get an agreement from the [[Home Office]] for their [[Fresh Talent Initiative]] which was designed to encourage foreign graduates of [[Scottish universities]] to stay in Scotland to look for employment. <ref>[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2004/02/18984/33666 New Scots: Attracting Fresh Talent to meet the Challenge of Growth] scotland.gov.uk, accessed 4 November 2008</ref> Fresh Talent is now closed following the introduction of the points-based system. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/workingintheuk/tier1/freshtalent/|title=Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland|publisher=UK Border Agency|accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref> . 

===Refugees and asylum seekers===. 
[[Image:Asylumapplicants.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Asylum applications rose then fell during the period 1993 to 2008. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs04/hosb1104.pdf|title=Asylum Statistics: United Kingdom 2003|date=24 August 2004|last1=Heath|first1=Tina|last2=Jeffries|first2=Richard|last3=Purcell|first3=James|publisher=Home Office|page=28|accessdate=18 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs09/hosb1409suppa.xls|title=Control of Immigration: Statistics United Kingdom 2008|publisher=Home Office|page=2a|date=August 2009|accessdate=18 May 2010}}</ref>]] . 

The UK is a signatory to the [[United Nations]] [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]], which means that it has a responsibility under international law not to return (or refoule) refugees to the place where they would face persecution.   . 

Nonetheless the issue of immigration has been a controversial political issue since the late 1990s. Both the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] have suggested policies perceived as being "tough on asylum"<ref>Tom Bentley [http://www.opendemocracy.net/debates/article.jsp?id=6&debateId=27&articleId=2339 Please, not again!] openDemocracy, 11 February 2005</ref> (although the Conservatives have dropped a previous pledge to limit the number of people who could claim asylum in the UK, which would likely have breached the UN Refugee Convention)<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6134130.stm Q&A: Conservatives and Immigration], BBC News, 9 November 2006, accessed 13 December 2007</ref> and the [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] media frequently print headlines about an "immigration crisis". <ref name="ippr">Roy Greenslade [http://www.ippr.org/ecomm/files/wp5_scapegoats.pdf Seeking scapegoats: The coverage of asylum in the UK press (PDF)], Institute for Public Policy Research, May 2005</ref> . 

This is denounced by those seeking to ensure that the UK upholds its international obligations as disproportionate. Critics suggest that much of the opposition to high levels of immigration by refugees is based on [[racism]]. Concern is also raised about the treatment of those held in detention and the practice of [[dawn raid]]ing families, and holding young children in [[immigration detention]] centres for long periods of time. <ref name="Nicol Stephen">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6320959.stm|title=Nicol Stephen condemns dawn raids|date=1 February 2007|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=29 November 2009}}</ref><ref name="Children">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8384860.stm|title=Migrant children held 'too long' in detention, MPs say|date=29 November 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=29 November 2009}}</ref> The policy of detaining asylum-seeking children was to be abandoned as part of the [[Conservative – Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement|coalition agreement]] between the Conservatives and the [[Liberal Democrats]], who formed a government in May 2010. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article7124648.ece|title=Detention of asylum-seeker children to be scrapped|work=The Times|date=13 May 2010|accessdate=17 May 2010 | location=London}}</ref> However, in July 2010 the government was accused of back-tracking on this promise after the Immigration Minister [[Damian Green]] announced that the plan was to minimise, rather than end, child detention. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/sep/09/detention-children-immigration-centres|title=Government climbdown on detention of children in immigration centres|first1=Karen|last1=McVeigh|first2=Matthew|last2=Taylor|work=The Guardian|date=9 September 2010|accessdate=10 September 2010}}</ref> . 

However, critics of the UK's asylum policy often point out the "safe third country rule" - the [[Dublin Regulation|convention]] that asylum seekers must apply in the first free nation they reach, not go "[[asylum shopping]]" for the nation they prefer. EU courts have upheld this policy. <ref>[http://www.asylumlaw.org/asylumseeker/firstaid.htm First Aid for asylum seekers] Asylumlaw.org</ref> Research conducted by the [[Refugee Council]] suggests that most asylum seekers in the UK had their destination chosen for them by external parties or agents, rather than choosing the UK themselves. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/jan/14/chance-choice-britain-refugees-council-report|title=Chance brings refugees to Britain not choice, says report|last=Travis|first=Alan|date=14 January 2010|work=The Guardian|accessdate=14 January 2010 | location=London}}</ref> . 

In February 2003, Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] promised on television to reduce the number of asylum seekers by half within 7 months,<ref>[http://newswww.bbc.net.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2738065.stm Blair's asylum gamble] BBC News 7 February 2003</ref> apparently catching unawares the members of his own government with responsibility for immigration policy.  [[David Blunkett]], the then [[Home Secretary]], called the promise an ''objective'' rather than a ''target''. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/2741463.stm Ministers back down on asylum pledge] BBC News 10 February 2003</ref>  . 

It was met according to official figures,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/3241892.stm Blair's asylum target met] BBC News  27 November 2003</ref> despite increase world instability caused by the [[Iraq War]].  There is also a Public Performance Target to remove more asylum seekers who have been judged not to be refugees under the internation definition than  new anticipated unfounded applications. This target was met early in 2006. <ref>[http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/6353/aboutus/TTB_definition_draft_techni1.pdf Public performance target: removing more failed asylum seekers than new anticipated unfounded applications] Home Office</ref> Official figures for numbers of people claiming asylum in the UK were at a 13 year low by March 2006. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4816392.stm UK asylum claims at '13-year low'] [[BBC]] News 17 March 2006</ref> . 

[[Human rights]] organisations such as [[Amnesty International]] have argued that the government's new policies, particularly those concerning [[immigration detention|detention]] centres, have detrimental effects on asylum applicants<ref>[http://www.amnesty.org.uk/uploads/documents/doc_16178.pdf Seeking asylum is not a crime: Detention of people who have sought asylum (PDF)] Amnesty International, 20 June 2005</ref> and their children,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/aug/30/ministers-under-fire-immigrant-children|title=Ministers under fire for locking up immigrant children|last=McVeigh|first=Karen|date=2009-08-31|work=The Guardian|page=1|accessdate=2009-08-31 | location=London}}</ref> and those facilities have seen a number of [[hunger strikes]] and [[suicides]]. Others have argued that recent government policies aimed at reducing '[[bogus]]' asylum claims have had detrimental impacts on those genuinely in need of protection. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Cooley|first=Laurence|coauthors=Rutter, Jill|year=2007|title=Turned away?

In addition to offering asylum, the UK operates a small refugee resettlement scheme in co-operation with the [[UNHCR]] known as the [[Gateway Protection Programme]]. <ref name="Gateway">{{cite web|url=http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/asylum/gateway/|title=Gateway Protection Programme|publisher=UK Border Agency|accessdate=2009-07-18}}</ref> . 

===Illegal immigration===. 
{{Main|Illegal immigration to the United Kingdom}}
Illegal (sometimes termed ''irregular'') immigrants in the UK include those who have:
* entered the UK without authority
* entered with false documents
* overstayed their visas . 

Although it is difficult to know how many people reside in the UK illegally, a Home Office study released in March 2005 estimated a population of between 310,000 and 570,000. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4989874.stm  The thorny issue of illegal migrants] BBC News, 17 May 2006. </ref> [[Migration Watch UK]] has criticised the Home Office figures for not including the UK-born dependent children of unauthorised migrants. They suggest the Home Office has underestimated the numbers of unauthorised migrants by between 15,000 and 85,000. <ref name="mW">[http://www.migrationwatchuk.org/Briefingpapers/migration_trends/illegal_migrant_pop_in_uk.asp The illegal Migrant Population in the UK] Migration Watch UK, Briefing paper 9.15,Migration Trends. </ref> In 2002 the Home office stated that the figures Migration Watch produces should be treated with 'considerable caution', because of the intrinsic difficulty of quantifying undocumented immigration. <ref name="fact_or_hype">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2173792.stm Immigration: Fact or hype?] By Dominic Casciani, BBC News, 5 August 2002. </ref>  The UK Immigration Advisory Service has referred to these estimates as "idle speculaton". <ref name="fact_or_hype"/> . 

A recent study into irregular immigration states that "most irregular migrants have committed administrative offences rather than a serious crime". <ref>[http://www.ippr.org/ecomm/files/irregular_migration.pdf Irregular migration in the UK: An ippr factfile] Institute for Public Policy Research, April 2006, p. 5. </ref> . 

[[Jack Dromey]], Deputy General of the [[Transport and General Workers Union]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] treasurer, suggested in May 2006 that there could be around 500,000 illegal workers. He called for a public debate on whether an amnesty should be considered. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5000678.stm Amnesty call over illegal workers] BBC News, 20 May 2006. </ref> [[David Blunkett]] has suggested that this might be done once the [[British national identity card|identity card]] scheme is rolled out. <ref>[http://www.epolitix.com/EN/News/200606/8ea36546-3f04-4fff-a470-a63009bdff7e.htm Blunkett: Immigration amnesty on cards] epolitix.com, 14 June 2006</ref>  . 

[[London Citizens]], a coalition of community organisations, is running a regularisation campaign called ''Strangers into Citizens'', backed by figures including the former leader of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, the [[Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor]]. <ref>Joe Boyle, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6633015.stm Migrants find a voice in the rain], BBC News, 7 May 2007, accessed 21 May 2007</ref> Analysis by the [[Institute for Public Policy Research]] suggested that an amnesty would net the government up to  £1.038 billion per year in fiscal revenue. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ippr.org/pressreleases/?id=2794|title=Jacqui Smith should back amnesty for illegal workers|date=2007-07-15|publisher=Institute for Public Policy Research|accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref> However, analysis by [[MigrationWatch UK]] suggests that if the migrants granted amnesty were given access to healthcare and other benefits, the net cost to the exchequer would be £5.530 billion annually. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.migrationwatchuk.com/Briefingpapers/legal/8_19_True_cost_of_Amnesty.asp|title=The true cost of an amnesty for illegal immigrants|date=2007-08-30|publisher=MigrationWatch UK|accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref>  . 

It has since been suggested that to deport all of the irregular migrants from the UK would take 20 years and cost up to £12 billion. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ippr.org/pressreleases/?id=3483|title=Tighter immigration controls could enable an amnesty for illegal immigrants say IPPR|date=2009-05-03|publisher=Institute for Public Policy Research|accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref> Current [[Mayor of London]] [[Boris Johnson]] has commissioned a study into a possible amnesty for illegal immigrants, citing larger tax gains within the London area which is considered to be home to the majority of the country's population of such immigrants. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7743081.stm|title=Johnson ponders immigrant amnesty|date=2008-11-22|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2008-11-24}}</ref> . 

In February 2008, the government introduced new £10,000 fines for employers found to be employing illegal immigrants where there is negligence on the part of the employer, with unlimited fines or jail sentences for employers acting knowingly. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article3455997.ece|title=£10,000 fines for employing illegal migrant without check|author=Richard Ford|publisher=''The Times''|date=2008-02-29|accessdate=2008-03-22 | location=London}}</ref> . 

===Comparison with other countries from European Union===. 
According to [[Eurostat]]  47.3 million people lived in the [[European Union]] in 2010 who were born outside their resident country. This corresponds to 9.4% of the total EU population. Of these, 31.4 million (6.3%) were born outside the EU and 16.0 million (3.2%) were born in another EU member state. The largest absolute numbers of people born outside the EU were in Germany (6.4 million), France (5.1 million), the United Kingdom (4.7 million),  Spain (4.1 million), Italy (3.2 million), and the Netherlands (1.4 million). <ref>[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-11-034/EN/KS-SF-11-034-EN.PDF 6.5% of the EU population are foreigners and 9.4% are born abroad], Eurostat, Katya VASILEVA, 34/2011. </ref>  .
