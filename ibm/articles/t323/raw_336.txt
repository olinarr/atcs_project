'''Human migration''' (derived from [[Latin language|Latin]]: ''migratio'') is physical movement by [[human]]s from one area to another, sometimes over long distances or in large groups. Historically this movement was [[nomad]]ic, often causing significant conflict with the indigenous population and their [[Forced migration|displacement]] or [[cultural assimilation]]. Only a few [[nomadic people]] have retained this form of lifestyle in modern times. Migration has continued under the form of both voluntary migration within one's region, country, or beyond and involuntary migration (which includes the [[History of slavery|slave trade]], [[Human trafficking|trafficking in human beings]] and [[ethnic cleansing]]). People who migrate into a territory are called [[immigration|immigrants]], while at the departure point they are called [[emigration|emigrants]]. Small populations migrating to develop a territory considered void of settlement depending on historical setting, circumstances and perspective are referred to as [[settler]]s or [[colony|colonists]], while populations displaced by immigration and colonization are called [[refugees]]. The rest of this article will cover sense of a "change of residence", rather than the temporary migrations of travel, tourism, pilgrimages, or the commute.  . 

==Definition==. 
According to [[International Organization for Migration]], "no universally accepted definition for (migrant) exists. The term migrant was usually understood to cover all cases where the decision to migrate was taken freely by the individual concerned for reasons of "personal convenience" and without intervention of an external compelling factor; it therefore applied to persons, and family members, moving to another country or region to better their material or social conditions and improve the prospect for themselves or their family. The United Nations defines migrant as an individual who has resided in a foreign country for more than one year irrespective of the causes, voluntary or involuntary, and the means, regular or irregular, used to migrate. Under such a definition, those travelling for shorter periods as [[tourist]]s and businesspersons would not be considered migrants. However, common usage includes certain kinds of shorter-term migrants, such as [[Seasonal unemployment|seasonal]] farm-workers who travel for short periods to work planting or harvesting farm products." <ref>[Key migration terms http://www.iom.int/jahia/Jahia/about-migration/key-migration-terms/lang/en#Migrant]</ref>
Also, human migration happened when the Paleo-Indians entered America.        For key stage 3 . 

==Migration statistics==. 
According to the [[International Organization for Migration]]'s World Migration Report 2010, the number of international migrants was estimated at 214 million in 2010. If this number continues to grow at the same pace as during the last 20 years, it could reach 405 million by 2050. <ref name="IOM WMR 2010">{{citation|url=http://publications.iom.int/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=37&products_id=653&language=en|publisher=International Organization for Migration|title=World Migration Report 2010 - The Future of Migration: Building Capacities for Change|year=2010|accessdate=2010-11-30}}</ref> While some modern migration is a byproduct of wars (for example, emigration from Iraq and Bosnia to the US and UK), political conflicts (for example, some emigration from Zimbabwe to the UK), and natural disasters (for example, emigration from Montserrat to the UK following the eruption of the island's volcano), contemporary migration is predominantly economically motivated. In particular, there are wide disparities in the incomes that can be earned for similar work in different countries of the world. There are also, at any given time, some jobs in some high-wage countries for which there is a shortage of appropriately skilled or qualified citizens. Some countries (e.g., UK and Australia) operate points systems that give some lawful immigration visas to some non-citizens who are qualified for such shortage jobs. Non-citizens, therefore, have an economic incentive to obtain the necessary skills and qualifications in their own countries and then apply for, and migrate to take up, these job vacancies. International migration similarly motivated by economic disparities and opportunities occurs within the EU, where legal barriers to migration between member countries have been wholly or partially lifted. Countries with higher prevailing wage levels, such as France, Germany, Italy and the UK are net recipients of immigration from lower-wage member countries such as Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland and Romania.  . 

Some contemporary economic migration occurs even where the migrant becomes illegally resident in their destination country and therefore at major disadvantage in the employment market. Illegal immigrants are, for example, known to cross in significant numbers, typically at night, from Mexico into the US, from Mozambique into South Africa, from Bulgaria and Turkey into Greece, and from north Africa into Spain and Italy.  . 

The pressures of human migrations, whether as outright conquest or by slow cultural infiltration and resettlement, have affected the grand epochs in history and in land (for example, the [[decline of the Roman Empire]]); under the form of [[colonization]], migration has transformed the world (such as the prehistoric and historic settlements of Australia and the Americas). [[Population genetics]] studied in traditionally settled modern populations have opened a window into the historical patterns of migrations, a technique pioneered by [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza]].  . 

[[Population transfer|Forced migration]] has been a means of social control under authoritarian regimes, yet free-initiative migration is a powerful factor in social adjustment and the growth of urban populations.

In December 2003, The Global Commission on International Migration (GCIM) was launched with the support of [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] [[Kofi Annan]] and several countries, with an independent 19-member commission, a threefold mandate and a finite lifespan ending December 2005. Its report, based on regional consultation meetings with stakeholders and scientific reports from leading international migration experts, was published and presented to Kofi Annan on 5 October 2005. <ref>The 90-page Report, along with supporting evidence, is available on the GCIM website [http://www.gcim.org gcim.org]</ref> . 

International migration challenges at the global level are addressed through the [[Global Migration Group]], established in 2006.  . 

Different types of migration include: . 

*[[Seasonal human migration]] mainly related to agriculture and tourism to urban places
*Rural to urban, more common in developing countries as industrialization takes effect ([[urbanization]])
*Urban to rural, more common in developed countries due to a higher cost of urban living ([[suburbanization]])
*[[International migration]] . 

==Pre-modern migrations==. 
{{main|Early human migrations|Historical migration}}
[[Image:Invasions of the Roman Empire 1.png|thumb|260px|4th to 6th century [[Migration Period]]]]
Historical migration of human populations begins with the movement of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' out of Africa across [[Eurasia]] about a million years ago. ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]'' appear to have occupied all of Africa about 150,000 years ago, moved out of Africa 70,000 years ago, and had spread across [[Prehistory of Australia|Australia]], [[History of Asia|Asia]] and [[Paleolithic Europe|Europe]] by 40,000 years BC. [[Models of migration to the New World|Migration to the Americas]] took place 20,000 to 15,000 years ago, and by 2,000 years ago, most of the [[Pacific Islands]] were colonized. Later population movements notably include the [[Neolithic Revolution]], [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European expansion]], and the Early Medieval [[Migration Period|Great Migrations]] including [[Turkic migration|Turkic expansion]]. In some places, substantial cultural transformation occurred following the migration of relatively small elite populations, [[Turkey]] and [[Azerbaijan]] being such examples. <ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/342096 |author=Tatjana Zerjal ''et al.'' |title=A Genetic Landscape Reshaped by Recent Events: Y-Chromosomal Insights into Central Asia |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |year=2002 |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=466–482 |pmid=12145751 |pmc=419996}}</ref></blockquote> In Britain, it is considered that the Roman and Norman conquests were similar examples, while "the most hotly debated of all the British cultural transitions is the role of migration in the relatively sudden and drastic change from Romano-Britain to Anglo-Saxon Britain", which may be explained by a possible "substantial migration of Anglo-Saxon Y chromosomes into Central England (contributing 50%–100% to the gene pool at that time."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Weale|first=Michael E.|coauthors=Deborah A. Weiss,1, Rolf F. Jager, Neil Bradman and Mark G.

Early humans migrated due to many factors such as changing climate and landscape and inadequate food supply. The evidence indicates that the ancestors of the [[Austronesian peoples]] spread from the South Chinese mainland to Taiwan at some time around 8,000 years ago. Evidence from [[historical linguistics]] suggests that it is from this island that seafaring peoples migrated, perhaps in distinct waves separated by millennia, to the entire region encompassed by the [[Austronesian languages]]. It is believed that this migration began around 6,000 years ago. <ref>[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v405/n6790/full/4051052a0.html Language trees support the express-train sequence of Austronesian expansion], [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]</ref> [[Indo-Aryan migration]] from the Indus Valley to the plain of the River Ganges in Northern India is presumed to have taken place in the Middle to Late Bronze Age, contemporary to the [[Cemetery H culture|Late Harappan]] phase in India (ca. 1700 to 1300&nbsp;BC). From 180&nbsp;BC, a series of invasions from [[Central Asia]] followed, including those led by the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom|Indo-Greeks]], [[Indo-Scythians]], [[Indo-Parthian Kingdom|Indo-Parthians]] and [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]] in the northwestern [[Indian subcontinent]]. <ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-46837/India The appearance of Indo-Aryan speakers], [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Bijal P|last=Trivedi|title=Genetic evidence suggests European migrants may have influenced the origins of India's caste system|url=http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/articles/05_01/Indo-European.shtml|work=Genome News Network|publisher=J.

From 728&nbsp;BC, the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] began 250 years of expansion, settling [[Colonies in antiquity|colonies]] in several places, including Sicily and Marseille. In Europe, two waves of migrations dominate demographic distributions, that of the [[Celts|Celtic people]] and that of the later [[Migration Period]] from the North and East, both being possible examples of general cultural change sparked by primarily elite and warrior migration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Other examples are small movements like that of the Magyars into [[Pannonia]] (modern-day [[Hungary]]). [[Turkic peoples]] spread from their homeland in modern Turkestan across most of [[Central Asia]] into [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]] between the 6th and 11th centuries. Recent research suggests that [[Madagascar]] was uninhabited until [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] seafarers from [[Indonesia]] arrived during the 5th and 6th centuries AD. Subsequent migrations from both the Pacific and Africa further consolidated this original mixture, and [[Malagasy people]] emerged. <ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-359466/article-9050264 Malagasy languages], [[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]</ref>
[[Image:Bantu expansion.png|thumb|One common hypothesis of the [[Bantu expansion]]]] . 

Before the expansion of the [[Bantu languages]] and their speakers, the southern half of [[Africa]] is believed to have been populated by [[Pygmies]] and [[Khoisan]]-speaking people, today occupying the arid regions around the [[Kalahari Desert]] and the forest of Central Africa. By about 1000&nbsp;AD, Bantu migration had reached modern day [[Zimbabwe]] and [[South Africa]]. The [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Maqil|Banu Ma'qil]] were a collection of [[Arab]] [[Bedouin]] tribes from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] who migrated westwards via [[Egypt]] between the 11th and 13th centuries. Their migration strongly contributed to the [[Arabization]] and [[Islamization]] of the western [[Maghreb]], which was until then dominated by [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes. [[Ostsiedlung]] was the medieval eastward migration and settlement of [[Ethnic Germans|Germans]]. The 13th century was the time of the great [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] and [[Turkic migration]]s across [[Eurasia]]. <ref>[http://www.acurioustraveler.com/migrations_&_world_history_p_27.htm Migrations-&-World History]</ref> . 

Between the 11th and 18th centuries, there were numerous migrations in Asia. The Vatsayan Priests from the eastern Himalaya hills, migrated to Kashmir during the Shan invasion in 1203C. They settled in the lower Shivalik hills in 1206C to sanctify the manifest goddess. In the Ming occupation, the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] expanded southward in a process known as [[History of Vietnam#Ming occupation and the rise of the Le dynasty|nam tiến]] (southward expansion). <ref>[http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/11.htm The Le Dynasty and Southward Expansion]</ref> [[Manchuria]] was separated from [[China proper]] by the Inner [[Willow Palisade]], which restricted the movement of the [[Han Chinese]] into Manchuria during the [[Qing Dynasty]], as the area was off-limits to the Han until the Qing started colonizing the area with them later on in the dynasty's rule. <ref>[http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~inaasim/Mingqing04/Qing2.htm From Ming to Qing]</ref> . 

The [[Age of Discovery|Age of Exploration]] and European [[colonialism]] led to an accelerated pace of migration since Early Modern times. In the 16th century, perhaps 240,000 Europeans entered American ports. <ref>[http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/AXTELL01.ART "The Colombian Mosaic in Colonial America" by James Axtell]</ref> In the 19th century, over 50 million people left Europe for the Americas. <ref>David Eltis ''Economic Growth and the Ending of the Transatlantic slave trade''</ref> The local populations or tribes, such as the [[Indigenous peoples|Aboriginal people]] in Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Japan<ref>[http://www.hurights.or.jp/asia-pacific/no_04/06reporton.htm Report on a New Policy for the Ainu: A Critique]</ref> and the United States, were usually far overwhelmed numerically by the settlers.  . 

==Modern migrations==. 
===Industrialization===. 
While the pace of migration had accelerated since the 18th century already (including the involuntary [[History of slavery|slave trade]]), it would increase further in the 19th century. Manning distinguishes three major types of migration: labor migration, refugee migrations, and [[urbanization]]. Millions of agricultural workers left the countryside and moved to the cities causing unprecedented levels of urbanization. This phenomenon began in Britain in the late 18th century and spread around the world and continues to this day in many areas.  . 

[[Industrial Revolution|Industrialization]] encouraged migration wherever it appeared. The increasingly global economy globalized the labor market. The [[Atlantic slave trade]] diminished sharply after 1820, which gave rise to self-bound [[Indentured servant|contract labor]] migration from Europe and Asia to plantations. Overpopulation{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}, open agricultural frontiers, and rising industrial centers attracted voluntary migrants. Moreover, migration was significantly made easier by improved transportation techniques.  . 

Transnational labor migration reached a peak of three million migrants per year in the early twentieth century. Italy, Norway, Ireland and the Guangdong region of China were regions with especially high [[emigration]] rates during these years. These large migration flows influenced the process of nation state formation in many ways. [[List of United States immigration legislation|Immigration restrictions]] have been developed, as well as [[diaspora]] cultures and myths that reflect the importance of migration to the foundation of certain nations, like the American [[melting pot]]. The transnational labor migration fell to a lower level from 1930s to the 1960s and then rebounded.  . 

The United States experienced considerable internal migration related to industrialization, including its [[African American]] population. From 1910–1970, approximately 7 million African Americans migrated from the rural [[Southern United States]], where blacks faced both poor economic opportunities and considerable political and social prejudice, to the industrial cities of the Northeast, Midwest and West, where relatively well-paid jobs were available. <ref name="pbs">[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/545.html Great Migration], accessed 12/7/2007</ref> This phenomenon came to be known in the United States as its own [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. With the demise of legalized segregation in the 1960s and greatly improved economic opportunities in the South in the subsequent decades, millions of blacks have returned to the South from other parts of the country since 1980 in what has been called the [[New Great Migration]].  . 

===World War I===. 
[[image:Muslim_refugees_in_the_initial_phase_of_the_First_Balkan_War.png|200px|thumb|Balkan Turks in 1912]]
[[File:Migrants Suisses de Russie, environ 1921.jpg|thumb|Swiss woman and her children leaving Civil war in Russia, around 1921]]
The twentieth century experienced also an increase in migratory flows caused by war and politics. Muslims moved from the Balkan to Turkey, while Christians moved the other way, during the collapse of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Four hundred thousand Jews moved to Palestine in the early twentieth century. The [[Russian Civil War]] caused some three million Russians, Poles and Germans to migrate out of the Soviet Union. World War II and [[decolonization]] also caused migrations. <ref>Patrick Manning, ''Migration in World History'' (2005) p 132-162. </ref><ref>Adam McKeown,  'Global migration, 1846-1940' in: ''Journal of Global History'' (June 2004). </ref> . 

===World War II===. 
See ''[[World War II evacuation and expulsion]]'' and ''[[Population transfer in the Soviet Union]]'' for World War II forced migrations.  . 

The [[Jew]]ish communities across Europe, the Mediterranean and the Middle East were formed from voluntary and involuntary migrants. After [[the Holocaust]] (1938 to 1945), there was increased migration to the [[British Mandate of Palestine]], which became the modern state of [[Israel]] as a result of the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]].  . 

Provisions of the [[Potsdam Agreement]] from 1945 signed by victorious [[Western Allies]] and the [[Soviet Union]] led to one of the largest European migrations, and the largest in the 20th century. It involved the migration and resettlement of close to or over 20 million people. The largest affected group were [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|16.5 million Germans expelled from Eastern Europe westwards]]. The second largest group were [[Poles]], [[Repatriation of Poles (1944–1946)|millions of whom were expelled]] westwards from eastern [[Kresy]] region and resettled in the so-called [[Recovered Territories]] (see [[Oder-Neisse line#Allies decide Polish border|Allies decide Polish border]] in the article on the [[Oder-Neisse line]]). Hundreds of thousands of Poles, Ukrainians ([[Operation Vistula]]), Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians and some Belarusians were expelled eastwards from Europe to the Soviet Union. Finally, many of the several hundred thousand Jews remaining in Eastern Europe after the Holocaust [[Berihah|migrated outside Europe]] to [[Israel]] and the United States.  . 

===Pakistan-India===. 
{{main|Partition of India}}
[[Image:Oxcart-train1947.jpg|thumb|Rural Sikhs in a long ox-cart train heading towards India. [[Margaret Bourke-White]], 1947. The migration was a "massive exercise in human misery," wrote Bourke-White.]]
In 1947, upon the [[Partition of India]], large populations moved from India to Pakistan and vice versa, depending on their religious beliefs. The partition was promulgated in the [[Indian Independence Act 1947]] as a result of the dissolution of the [[British Indian Empire]]. The partition displaced up to 12.5 million people in the former British Indian Empire, with estimates of loss of life varying from several hundred thousand to a million. <ref>Metcalf, Barbara; Metcalf, Thomas R. (2006), A Concise History of Modern India (Cambridge Concise Histories), Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press. Pp. xxxiii, 372, ISBN 0-521-68225-8. </ref>[[Muslim]] residents of the former British India migrated to [[Pakistan]] (including East Pakistan which is now Bangladesh), whilst [[Hindu]] and [[Sikh]] residents of Pakistan and Hindu residents of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) moved in the opposite direction.  . 

In modern India, estimates based on industry sectors mainly employing migrants suggest that there are around 100 million circular migrants in India. Caste, social networks and historical precedents play a powerful role in shaping patterns of migration. Migration for the poor is mainly circular, as despite moving temporarily to urban areas, they lack the social security which might keep them there more permanently. They are also keen to maintain a foothold in home areas during the agricultural season.  . 

Research by the [[Overseas Development Institute]] identifies a rapid movement of labour from slower- to faster-growing parts of the economy. Migrants can often find themselves excluded by urban housing policies, and [[Migrant worker|migrant]] support initiatives are needed to give workers improved access to market information, certification of identity, [[House|housing]] and [[education]]. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2466&title=support-migrant-workers-missing-link-indias-development|title=Support for migrant workers: the missing link in India's development?|date=September 2008|publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]]}}</ref>

==Theories for migration for work in the 21st century==. 
===Overview=== . 

Migration for work in the 21st century has become a popular way for individuals from impoverished developing countries to obtain sufficient income for survival. This income is sent home to family members in the form of [[remittances]] and has become an economic staple in a number of developing countries, namely the Philippines and those in Latin America. <ref>Jason de Parle, “A Good Provider is One Who Leaves” New York Times, April 22, 2007. </ref> There are a number of theories to explain the international flow of capital and people from one country to another. <ref name="Jennissen, R 2007">Jennissen, R. 2007. “Causality Chains in the International Migration Systems Approach.” Population Research and Policy Review 26(4). 411 – 36. </ref> . 

===Neoclassical economic theory=== . 

This is the newest theory of migration and states that the main reason for labor migration is wage difference between two geographic locations. These wage differences are usually linked to geographic labor demand and supply. It can be said that areas with a shortage of labor but an excess of capital have a high relative wage while areas with a high labor supply and a dearth of capital have a low relative wage. Labor tends to flow from low-wage areas to high-wage areas. Often, with this flow of labor comes changes in the sending as well as the receiving country. Neoclassical economic theory is best used to describe transnational migration, because it is not confined by international immigration laws and similar governmental regulations. <ref name="Jennissen, R 2007"/> . 

===Dual labor market theory=== . 

Dual labor market theory states that migration is mainly caused by pull factors in more developed countries. This theory assumes that the labor markets in these developed countries consist of two segments: primary, which requires high-skilled labor, and secondary, which is very labor-intensive but requires low-skilled workers. This theory assumes that migration from less developed countries into more developed countries is a result of a pull created by a need for labor in the developed countries in their secondary market. [[Migrant worker]]s are needed to fill the lowest rung of the labor market because the native laborers do not want to do these jobs as they present a lack of mobility. This creates a need for migrant workers. Furthermore, the initial dearth in available labor pushes wages up, making migration even more enticing. <ref name="Jennissen, R 2007"/> . 

===The new economics of labor migration=== . 

This theory states that migration flows and patterns cannot be explained solely at the level of individual workers and their economic incentives, but that wider social entities must be considered as well. One such social entity is the household. Migration can be viewed as a result of risk aversion on the part of a household that has insufficient income. The household, in this case, is in need of extra capital that can be achieved through remittances sent back by family members who participate in migrant labor abroad. These [[remittances]] can also have a broader effect on the economy of the sending country as a whole as they bring in capital. <ref name="Jennissen, R 2007"/> . 

===Relative deprivation theory=== . 

Relative deprivation theory states that awareness of the income difference between neighbors or other households in the migrant-sending community is an important factor in migration. The incentive to migrate is a lot higher in areas that have a high level of economic inequality. In the short run, remittances may increase inequality, but in the long run, they may actually decrease it. There are two stages of migration for a worker: first, they invest in human capital formation, and then they try to capitalize on their investments. In this way, successful migrants may use their new capital to provide for better schooling for their children and better homes for their families. Successful high-skilled emigrants may serve as an example for neighbors and potential migrants who hope to achieve that level of success. <ref name="Jennissen, R 2007"/> . 

=== World systems theory === . 

World systems theory looks at migration from a global perspective. It explains that interaction between different societies can be an important factor in social change within societies.  Trade with one country, which causes economic decline in another, may create incentive to migrate to a country with a more vibrant economy. It can be argued that even after decolonization, the economic dependence of former colonies still remains on mother countries. This view of [[international trade]] is controversial, however, and some argue that free trade can actually reduce migration between developing and developed countries. It can be argued that the developed countries import labor-intensive goods, which causes an increase in employment of unskilled workers in the less developed countries, decreasing the outflow of migrant workers. The export of capital-intensive goods from rich countries to poor countries also equalizes income and employment conditions, thus also slowing migration. In either direction, this theory can be used to explain migration between countries that are geographically far apart. <ref name="Jennissen, R 2007"/> . 

==Historical theories==. 
===Ravenstein===. 
Certain laws of [[social sciences|social science]] have been proposed to describe human migration. The following was a standard list after [[Ernst Georg Ravenstein|Ravenstein's]] proposals during the time frame of 1834 to 1913. The laws are as follows:
# ''every migration flow generates a return or countermigration. 
# ''the majority of migrants move a short distance. 
# ''migrants who move longer distances tend to choose big-city destinations. 
# ''urban residents are often less migratory than inhabitants of rural areas. 
# ''families are less likely to make international moves than young adults. 
# ''most migrants are adults. 
# ''large towns grow by migration rather than natural increase.  . 

# ''Migration stage by stage
# ''Urban Rural difference
# ''Migration and Technology
# ''Economic condition . 

===Lee===. 
Lee's laws divides factors causing migrations into two groups of factors: push and pull factors. Push factors are things that are unfavourable about the area that one lives in, and pull factors are things that attract one to another area. <ref>{{cite journal |jstor= 2060063|title= A Theory of Migration|author= Everett S. Lee|year= 1966|publisher= University of Pennsylvania}}</ref> </br> .

See also article by Gürkan Çelik, in [http://www.turkishreview.org/tr/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=223107 Turkish Review: Turkey Pulls, The Netherlands Pushes?] An increasing number of Turks, the Netherlands’ largest ethnic minority, are beginning to return to Turkey, taking with them the education and skills they have acquired abroad, as the Netherlands faces challenges from economic difficulties, social tension and increasingly powerful far-right parties. At the same time Turkey’s political, social and economic conditions have been improving, making returning home all the more appealing for Turks at large. (pp.&nbsp;94–99) . 

===Climate cycles===. 
The modern field of climate history suggests that the successive waves of Eurasian nomadic movement throughout history have had their origins in [[Climate change|climatic cycles]], which have expanded or contracted pastureland in Central Asia, especially [[Mongolia]] and the Altai. People were displaced from their home ground by other tribes trying to find land that could be grazed by essential flocks, each group pushing the next further to the south and west, into the highlands of [[Anatolia]], the [[Pannonian Plain]], into [[Mesopotamia]] or southwards, into the rich pastures of [[China]].  . 

===Other models===. 
* ''Migration occurs because individuals search for food, sex and security outside their usual habitation.''<ref>Idyorough, 2008</ref>  Idyorough is of the view that towns and cities are a creation of the human struggle to obtain food, sex and security. To produce food, security and reproduction, human beings must, out of necessity, move out of their usual habitation and enter into indispensable social relationships that are cooperative or antagonistic.  Human beings also develop the tools and equipment to enable them to interact with nature to produce the desired food and security.   The improved relationship (cooperative relationships) among human beings and improved technology further conditioned by the push and pull factors all interact together to cause or bring about migration and higher concentration of individuals into towns and cities.  The higher the technology of production of food and security and the higher the cooperative relationship among human beings in the production of food and security and in the reproduction of the human species, the higher would be the push and pull factors in the migration and concentration of human beings in towns and cities.  Countryside, towns and cities do not just exist but they do so to meet the human basic needs of food, security and the reproduction of the human species.  Therefore, migration occurs because individuals search for food, sex and security outside their usual habitation. Social services in the towns and cities are provided to meet these basic needs for human survival and pleasure.
