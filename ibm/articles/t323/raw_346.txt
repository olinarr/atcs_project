'''Nativism''' favors the interests of certain established inhabitants of an area or nation as compared to claims of newcomers or immigrants. <ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nativism Merriam-webster dictionary, nativism]</ref>  It may also include the re-establishment or perpetuation of such individuals or their culture.  . 

Nativism typically means [[opposition to immigration]] or efforts to lower the political or legal status of specific ethnic or cultural groups because the groups are considered hostile or alien to the natural culture, and it is assumed that they cannot be assimilated. <ref>Thomas J. Curran, "Assimilation and Nativism," ''International Migration Digest,'' Vol. 3, No. 1 (Spring, 1966), pp. 15-25</ref> . 

According to Fetzer, (2000) opposition to immigration is common in many countries because of issues of national, cultural or religious identity.  The phenomenon has been studied especially in [[History of Australia|Australia]], [[History of Canada|Canada]], [[History of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and the [[History of the United States|United States]], as well as Europe in recent years. Thus nativism has become a general term for 'opposition to immigration' based on fears that the immigrants will distort or spoil existing cultural values. This may be expressed through [[criticism of multiculturalism]]. <ref>Joel S. Fetzer, "Economic self-interest or cultural marginality? Anti-immigration sentiment and nativist political movements in France, Germany and the USA," ''Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies,'' Volume 26, Issue 1 January 2000, pp 5-23</ref> . 

In situations where the nativistic movement exists inside of dominant culture it tends to be associated with [[xenophobic]] and [[assimilationist]] projects. At the other end of the spectrum, in situations where immigrants greatly outnumber the original inhabitants or where contact forces economic and cultural change,<ref>D. Groenfeldt, "The future of indigenous values: cultural relativism in the face of economic development," ''Futures'' Volume 35, Issue 9, November 2003, pp 917-929</ref> nativistic movements can allow cultural survival.  Among North American Indians important nativist movements include [[Neolin]] (the "Delaware Prophet", 1762),  [[Tenskwatawa]] (the Shawnee prophet, 1808), and [[Wovoka]] (the Ghost Dance movement, 1889). They displayed anti-white racism, teaching that whites were morally inferior to the Indians and their ways must be rejected.  Thus Tenskwatawa taught that the Americans were "children of the Evil Spirit."<ref>Philip Deloria and Neal Salisbury, eds. ''A companion to American Indian history'' (2004) p 131</ref><ref>Mary Kupiec Cayton and Peter W. Williams, eds, ''Encyclopedia of American cultural and intellectual history'' (2001) p. 297 for quote</ref> . 

In scholarly studies "nativism" is a standard technical term. However, in public political discourse "nativist" is a term of opprobrium usually used by the opposition, and rarely by nativists themselves (they call themselves "patriots."<ref>Peter Brimelow, ''Alien nation'' (1995) p. 254</ref>).  '''Anti-immigration''' is a more neutral term that may be used to characterize opponents of immigration.  .

===Nativism in the United States===. 
[[Image:immigrants1.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|[[Heroes of the Fiery Cross]] 1928, published by the [[Pillar of Fire Church]]]]
In the United States, anti-immigration views have a long history. For a while [[Benjamin Franklin]] was hostile to Germans in colonial Pennsylvania. <ref>He called them he called "Palatine Boors." John B. Frantz, "Franklin and the Pennsylvania Germans," ''Pennsylvania History'', [http://dpubs.libraries.psu.edu/DPubS?service=Repository&version=1.0&verb=Disseminate&view=body&content-type=pdf_1&handle=psu.ph/1141422413# Volume 65, Number 1 (Winter 1998), 21-34 online]</ref>   President [[John Adams]] in 1798 signed the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] which limited the ability of immigrants, especially radicals from [[France]] and [[Ireland]], to gain full political rights, and they became a major political issue in the [[United States presidential election, 1800|1800 election]]. <ref>James Morton Smith, ''Freedom's fetters: The Alien and Sedition laws and American civil liberties'' (1967)</ref> . 

Nativism gained its name from the "Native American" parties.  In this context "Native" does not mean indigenous or American Indian but rather those descended from the inhabitants of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]]. It impacted politics in the mid-19th century because of the large inflows of immigrants from cultures that were somewhat different from the existing American culture.  Thus, nativists objected primarily to Irish [[Roman Catholics]] because of their loyalty to the Pope and also because of their supposed rejection of republicanism as an American ideal. <ref>Ray A.  Billington, ''The Protestant Crusade, 1800–1860: A Study of the Origins of American Nativism'' (1938)</ref> . 

Nativist movements included the [[Know Nothing|Know Nothing or American Party]] of the 1850s, the [[Immigration Restriction League]] of the 1890s, the anti-Asian movements in the West, resulting in the [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882]] and the "[[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907]]" by which Japan's government stopped emigration to the U.S.  Labor unions were strong supporters of Chinese exclusion and limits on immigration, because of fears that they would lower wages and make it harder to organize unions. <ref>Tyler Anbinder, ''Nativism and Slavery: The Northern Know Nothings and the politics of the 1850s'' (1992). </ref> . 

====Anti-Catholic nativism in the 19th century====. 
Nativist outbursts occurred in the Northeast from the 1830s to the 1850s, primarily in response to a surge of Irish Catholic immigration.  In 1836, [[Samuel F. B. Morse]] ran unsuccessfully for [[Mayor of New York City]] on a Nativist ticket, receiving 1,496 votes. In [[New York City]], an Order of United Americans was founded as a nativist fraternity, following the [[Philadelphia Nativist Riots]] of the preceding spring and summer, in December, 1844. <ref name="ReferenceA">Billington, ''The Protestant Crusade, 1800–1860''</ref> . 

In 1849&ndash;50 Charles B. Allen founded a nativist society called the [[Order of the Star Spangled Banner]] in New York City. In order to join the Order, a man had to be twenty-one, a Protestant, a believer in God, and willing to obey without question the dictates of the order.  Members of the Order became known as the [[Know Nothings]] (a label applied to them because if asked they said they "know nothing about" the secret society). <ref name="ReferenceA"/> . 

The Nativists went public in 1854 when they formed the 'American Party', which was especially hostile to the immigration of Irish Catholics and campaigned for laws to require longer wait time between immigration and naturalization. (The laws never passed.)  It was at this time that the term "nativist" first appears, opponents denounced them as "bigoted nativists." Former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Millard Fillmore]] ran on the American Party ticket for the Presidency in 1856.  The American Party also included many ex-Whigs who ignored nativism, and included (in the South) a few Catholics whose families had long lived in America.  Conversely, much of the opposition to Catholics came from Protestant Irish immigrants and German Lutheran immigrants who were not native at all and can hardly be called "nativists."<ref>Anbinder, ''Nativism and Slavery: The Northern Know Nothings and the politics of the 1850s''</ref> . 

This form of [[nationalism]] is often identified with [[xenophobia]] and [[anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] sentiment (anti-Papism). In [[Charlestown, Massachusetts]], a nativist mob [[Ursuline Convent Riots|attacked and burned down]] a Catholic convent in 1834 (no one was injured).  In the 1840s, small scale riots between Catholics and nativists took place in several American cities.  In Philadelphia in 1844, for example, a series of nativist assaults on Catholic churches and community centers resulted in the loss of lives and the professionalization of the police force.  In [[Louisville, Kentucky]], election-day rioters killed at least 22 people in attacks on German and Irish Catholics on Aug. 6, 1855, in what became known as "[[Bloody Monday]]."<ref>Smith, Peter. "Recalling Bloody Monday; Events to mark 1855 anti-immigrant riots in city," The Courier-Journal, Louisville, Ky. (July 30, 2005); Crews, Clyde: ''An American Holy Land: A History of the Archdiocese of Louisville'' (1990). </ref> Nativist sentiment experienced a revival in the 1890s, led by Protestant Irish immigrants hostile to Catholic immigration. <ref>Donald L. Kinzer, ''Episode in Anti-Catholicism: The American Protective Association'' (1964)</ref> . 

====Anti-German nativism====. 
From the 1840s to 1920 [[German American]]s were distrusted because of their separatist social structure, their love of beer, their German-language schools, their attachment to their native tongue over English, and their neutrality in World War I.  . 

The [[Bennett Law]] caused a political uproar in Wisconsin in 1890, as the state government passed a law that threatened to close down hundreds of German-language elementary schools.  Catholic and Lutheran Germans rallied to defeat the incumbent Republican Governor, [[William D. Hoard]], the leader of the nativists. Hoard attacked German-American culture and religion:
:"We must fight alienism and selfish ecclesiasticism.... The parents, the pastors and the church have entered into a conspiracy to darken the understanding of the children, who are denied by cupidity and bigotry the privilege of even the free schools of the state."<ref name="content.wisconsinhistory.org">Quoted on p, 388 of William Foote Whyte, [http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/u/?/wmh,5642 "The Bennett Law Campaign in Wisconsin,"] ''Wisconsin Magazine Of History'', 10: 4 (1926-1927), p. 388</ref>
Hoard, a Republican, was defeated by the Democrats. A similar campaign in Illinois regarding the "Edwards Law" led to a Republican defeat there in 1890. <ref name="content.wisconsinhistory.org"/> . 

In 1917-1918, a wave of nativist sentiment led to the suppression of German cultural activities in the United States, Canada and Australia.  There was little violence, but many places and streets had their names changed (The city of "Berlin" in Ontario was renamed "Kitchener" after a British hero), churches switched to English for their services, and German Americans were forced to buy war bonds to show their patriotism. <ref>Frederick C. Luebke, ''Bonds of Loyalty: German-Americans and World War I'' (1974); Terrence G. Wiley,  "The Imposition of World War I Era English-Only Policies and the Fate of German in North America," in Barbara Burnaby and Thomas K. Ricento, eds. ''Language and Politics in the United States and Canada: Myths and Realities'' (1998); Russell A. Kazal, ''Becoming Old Stock: The Paradox of German-American Identity'' (2004)</ref>  In Australia thousands of Germans were put into internment camps. <ref>Stuart Macintyre, ''The Oxford History of Australia: vol. 4, The Succeeding Age, 1901-1942'' (1993), pp 153-55; Jurgen Tampke, ''The Germans in Australia'' (2007) pp 120-24. </ref> .

====Anti-Chinese nativism====. 
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}} . 

In the 1870s [[Irish American]] immigrants attacked Chinese immigrants in the western states, driving them out of smaller towns. [[Denis Kearney]] led a mass movement in San Francisco in 1877 that threatened to harm railroad owners if they hired any people who were Chinese. <ref>[http://www.sfmuseum.net/hist9/bryce2.html Kearneyism in California - by Viscount James Bryce<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref><ref>[http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist9/brycenotes.html Remarks by Denis Kearney on Kearneyism in California - 1889<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>  The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the first of many nativist acts of Congress to limit the flow of immigrants into the U.S.  The Chinese responded with false claims of American birth, enabling thousands to immigrate to California. <ref>Erika Lee, ''At America's Gates: Chinese Immigration during the Exclusion Era, 1882-1943'' (2003)</ref>   Ironically, the exclusion of the Chinese caused the western railroads to begin importing Mexican railroad workers in greater numbers ("[[traquero]]s"). <ref>Jeffrey Marcos Garcilazo,  ''`Traqueros': Mexican Railroad Workers in the United States, 1870 to 1930.''

====20th century====. 
In the 1890-1920 era nativists and labor unions campaigned for immigration restriction.  A favorite plan was the literacy test to exclude workers who could not read or write their own foreign language. Congress passed literacy tests, but presidents—responding to business needs for workers—vetoed them . <ref name="Pula 1980 5–31">{{cite journal|last=Pula|first=James|journal=Polish American Studies|date=Sring|year=1980|volume=37|issue=1|pages=5–31|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20148034|accessdate=3 December 2011}}</ref> Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] argued need for literacy tests and its implication on the new immigrants:
:It is found, in the first place, that the illiteracy test will bear most heavily upon the Italians, Russians, Poles, Hungarians, Greeks, and Asiatics, and very lightly, or not at all, upon English-speaking emigrants, or Germans, Scandinavians, and French.  In other words, the races most affected by the illiteracy test are those whose emigration to this country has begun within the last twenty years and swelled rapidly to enormous proportions, races with which the English speaking people have never hitherto assimilatated, and who are most alien to the great body of the people of the United States. <ref>{{cite web|last=Lodge|first=Henry Cabot|title=The Restriction Immigration|url=http://us.history.wisc.edu/hist102/pdocs/lodge_immigration.pdf|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison|accessdate=3 December 2011}}</ref> . 

Responding to these demands, opponents of the literacy test called for the establishment of an immigration commission to focus on immigration as a whole. The United States Immigration Commission, also known as the [[Dillingham Commission]], was created and tasked with studying immigration and its effect on the United States. The findings of the commission further influenced immigration policy and upheld the concerns of the nativist movement. <ref name="Pula 1980 5–31"/>  . 

Following World War I nativists in the twenties focused their attention on Catholics, Jews, and southeastern Europeans and realigned their beliefs behind racial and religious nativism. <ref name="Higham 1963 324">{{cite book|last=Higham|first=John|title=Strangers in the Land|year=1963|publisher=Atheneum|pages=324}}</ref> The racial concern of the anti-immigration movement was linked closely to the eugenics movement that was sweeping the United States in the twenties. Led by Madison Grant's book, ''The Passing of the Great Race'' nativists grew more concerned with the racial purity of the United States. In his book, Grant argued that the American racial stock was being diluted by the influx of new immigrants from the Mediterranean, the Balkans, and the Polish ghettos. ''The Passing of the Great Race'' reached wide popularity among Americans and influenced immigration policy in the twenties. <ref name="Pula 1980 5–31"/>
In the 1920s a wide national consensus sharply restricted the overall inflow of immigrants, especially those from southern and eastern Europe. The second [[Ku Klux Klan]], which flourished in the U.S. in the 1920s, used strong nativist rhetoric, but the Catholics led a counterattack. <ref>Todd Tucker, ''Notre Dame Vs. the Klan: How the Fighting Irish Defeated the Ku Klux Klan'' (2004)</ref> . 

After intense lobbying from the nativist movement the United States Congress passed the [[Emergency Quota Act]] in 1921.  This bill was the first to place numerical quotas on immigration.  It capped the inflow of immigrations to 357,803 for those arriving outside of the western hemisphere. <ref name="Pula 1980 5–31"/> However, this bill was only temporary as Congress began debating a more permanent bill.  . 

The Emergency Quota Act was followed with the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], a more permanent resolution.  This law reduced the number of immigrants able to arrive from 357,803, the number established in the Emergency Quota Act, to 164,687. <ref name="Pula 1980 5–31"/> Though this bill did not fully restrict immigration, it considerably curbed the flow of immigration into the United States.  During the late twenties an average of 270,000 immigrants were allowed to arrive mainly because of the exemption of Canada and Latin American countries. <ref name="Higham 1963 324"/> . 

Fear of low-skilled immigrants flooding the labor market was an issue in the 1920s (focused on immigrants from [[Italy]] and [[Poland]]), and in the first decade of the 21st century (focused on immigrants from Mexico and Central America).  . 

An [[immigration reduction]]ism movement formed in the 1970s and continues to the present day. Prominent members often press for massive, sometimes total, reductions in immigration levels.  . 

American nativist sentiment experienced a resurgence in the late 20th century, this time directed at [[illegal immigration|illegal aliens]], largely [[Mexico|Mexican]] resulting in the passage of new penalties against illegal immigration in 1996.  . 

[[Illegal immigration]], principally from across the [[United States&ndash;Mexico border]], is the more pressing concern for most immigration reductionists. Authors such as [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]] have also seen recent Hispanic immigration as creating a national identity crisis and presenting insurmountable problems for US social institutions. <ref>Huntington, ''[[Clash of Civilizations]]'' (1997)</ref> . 

====Language====. 
American nativists have promoted English and distrusted German and Spanish usage.  [[English Only]] proponents in the late 19th century proposed an English Language Amendment (ELA), a [[Constitutional amendment]] making English the official language of the United States, but have won little political support. <ref>Brandon Simpson, ''The American Language: The Case Against the English-only Movement'' (2009)</ref> . 

===Nativism in Canada===. 
Nativism was common in Canada (though the term originated in the U.S.).  It took several forms. Hostility to the Chinese and other Asians was intense, and involved provincial laws that hindered immigration of Chinese and Japanese and blocked their economic mobility. In 1942 Japanese Canadians were forced into detention camps. <ref>W. Peter Ward, ''White Canada Forever: Popular Attitudes and Public Policy toward Orientals in British Columbia'' (1978); Roger Daniels, ''Concentration Camps North America: Japanese in the United States and Canada During World War II'' (1993); Forrest E. Laviolette, "Two Years of Japanese Evacuation in Canada," ''Far Eastern Survey'', Vol. 13, No. 11 (May 31, 1944), pp. 93-100 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3023407 in JSTOR]</ref> . 

Throughout the 19th century, well into the 20th, the "Orange Orders" in Canada attacked and tried to politically defeat the Irish Catholics. <ref>Cecil J. Houston and William J. Smyth, ''The Sash Canada Wore: A Historical Geography of the Orange Order in Canada'' (1980); Robert McLaughlin, "Irish Nationalism and Orange Unionism in Canada: A Reappraisal," ''Éire-Ireland'' 41.3&4 (2007) 80-109</ref>  The [[Ku Klux Klan]] spread in the mid-1920s from the U.S. to parts of Canada, especially Saskatchewan, where it helped topple the Liberal government.  The Klan creed was, historian Martin Robin argues, in the mainstream of Protestant Canadian sentiment, for it was based on "Protestantism, separation of Church and State, pure patriotism, restrictive and selective immigration, one national public school, one flag and one language--English."<ref>Martin Robin, ''Shades of Right: Nativist and Fascist Politics in Canada, 1920-1940'' (1991), quote on pp. 23-24. Robin p 86, notes the Klan in Canada was not violent. </ref> . 

In World War I, Canadian naturalized citizens of German or Austrian origins were stripped of their right to vote, and tens of thousands of Ukrainians (who were born in the Austro-Hungarian Empire) were rounded up and put in internment camps. <ref>Frances Swyripa and John Herd Thompson, eds. ''Loyalties in Conflict: Ukrainians in Canada During the Great War'' (1983); and Bohdan Kordan, ''Enemy Aliens, Prisoners of War: Internment in Canada During the Great War'' (2002)</ref> . 

Hostility of native-born Canadians to competition from English immigrants in the early 20th century was expressed in signs that read, "No English Need Apply!"  The resentment came because the immigrants identified more with England than with Canada. <ref>Ross McCormack, "Cloth Caps and Jobs: The Ethnicity of English Immigrants in Canada, 1900-1914," in Jorgan Dahlie and Tissa Fernando, eds. ''Ethnicity, Power, and Politics in Canada'' (1981); Susan Jackel, '' A Flannel Shirt and Liberty: British Emigrant Gentlewomen in the Canadian  West, 1880-1914'' (1982) Page xx;  Basil Stewart, ''"No English Need Apply": Or, Canada as a Field for the Emigrant‎'' (1909)</ref> Still today, there are many Canadians with long Canadian heritages who have mixed feelings over recent immigration.  . 

[[Image:poperob.jpg|thumb|[[Guardians of Liberty]] 1943 by Bishop [[Alma White]]]]
In the British Empire, traditions of anti-Catholicism in Britain led to fears that Catholics were a threat to the national (British) values. In Canada, the Orange Order (of Irish Protestants) campaigned vigorously against the Catholics throughout the 19th century, often with violent confrontations.  Both sides were immigrants from Ireland and neither side claimed loyalty to Canada. <ref>Robert McLaughlin , “Irish Nationalism and Orange Unionism in Canada: A Reappraisal,” Éire-Ireland 41.3&4 (2007) 80-109;   Cecil J. Houston and William J. Smyth, ''The Sash Canada Wore: A Historical Geography of the Orange Order in Canada'' (1980)</ref>  The Orange Order was much less influential in the U.S., especially after a major riot in New York City in 1871.  . 

Also in Canada, British immigrants opposed French Canadians from Quebec, who were expanding beyond Quebec.  In Ontario (and other provinces), vigorous measures were attempted to prevent the establishment of French-language Catholic schools. The Irish Catholics (who spoke English) sided with the Protestants against the French-speaking Catholics.  . 

===Nativism in Australia===. 
Australia was intensely hostile to Chinese immigrants (thousands of whom came to the gold fields), and tried to block their entry until well after World War II.  When the nation of Australia formed in 1901, the national policy became "[[White Australia]]", and quickly most of the Pacific Islanders were deported, while the remainder were forced out of the sugar fields where they had worked for decades. <ref>After 1905 4000 "Kanakas" were repatriated and the remaining 2500 were pushed out of the sugar fields by labour unions.  Doug Munro, “The Labor Trade in Melanesians to Queensland: An Historiographic Essay,” ''Journal of Social History'', Vol. 28, No. 3 (Spring, 1995), pp. 609-627</ref> . 

During World War I, Australia put German citizens in internment camps. <ref>Stuart Macintyre, ''The Oxford History of Australia: vol. 4, The Succeeding Age, 1901-1942'' (1993), pp 153-55; Jurgen Tampke, ''The Germans in Australia'' (2007)</ref> . 

Hostility of native-born white Australians toward British and Irish immigrants in the late 19th century was manifested in a new party, the "Australian Natives' Association."<ref>Charles S. Blackton, "Australian Nationality and Nativism: The Australian Natives' Association, 1885-1901," Source: The Journal of Modern History, Vol. 30, No. 1 (Mar., 1958), pp. 37-46 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1871916 in JSTOR]</ref> . 

===Nativism in Taiwan===. 
Nativism flourished in [[Taiwan]] in the 1970s as a reaction against the influx of [[Mainlander|mainland]] [[Chinese people|Chinese]] to the island after the [[Kuomintang]]'s defeat in 1949. Nativists felt that the political influence of mainland Chinese was disproportionately large. The term is especially found in the field of [[literature]], where nativist literature was more traditionally minded than the [[modernist literature]] written largely by mainland Chinese.  . 

===Nativism in Europe===. 
London was notorious for its xenophobia in the 16th century, and conditions worsened the 1580s. Many immigrants became disillusioned by routine threats of violence and molestation, attempts at expulsion of foreigners, and the great difficulty in acquiring English citizenship. Dutch cities proved more hospitable, and many left London permanently. <ref>Bich Luu Lien, "Taking the Bread Out of Our Mouths": Xenophobia in Early Modern London," ''Immigrants and Minorities,'' July 2000, Vol. 19 Issue 2, pp 1-22</ref> . 

Regarding the Irish in 20th century Great Britain, Lucassen (2005) argues the deep religious divide between the Protestants and Catholics was at the core of the ongoing estrangement of the Irish in British society. For the Poles in the mining districts of western Germany before 1914, it was nationalism (on both the German and the Polish sides), which kept Polish workers, who had established an associational structure approaching institutional completeness (churches, voluntary associations, press, even unions), separate from the host German society. Lucassen found that religiosity and nationalism were more fundamental in generating nativism and inter-group hostility than the labor antagonism.  . 

Once Italian workers in France had understood the benefit of unionism and French unions were willing to overcome their fear of Italians as scabs, integration was open for most Italian immigrants. The French state, which was always more of an immigration state than Prussia, Germany or Great Britain, fostered and supported family-based immigration and thus helped Italians on their immigration trajectory with minimal nativism. (Lucassen 2005) . 

Many observers see the post-1950s wave of immigration in Europe was fundamentally different from the pre-1914 patterns. They debate the role of cultural differences, ghettos, race, Muslim fundamentalism, poor education and poverty play in creating nativism among the hosts and a caste-type underclass, more similar to white-black tensions in the US (Lucassen 2005) Algerian migration to France has generated nativism, characterized by the prominence of [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] and his [[National Front (France)|National Front]]. (Lucassen 2005) . 

== Anti-immigration arguments ==. 
{{main|Opposition to immigration}}
Anti-immigration sentiment is typically justified with one or more of the following arguments and claims about immigrants:<ref>Anbinder, (2006); Barkan, (2003); Betz, (2007); Higham, (1955); Lucassen, (2005); Palmer, (1992); and Schrag, (2010)</ref> . 

* [[Government spending|Government expense]]: Government expenses may exceed tax revenue relating to new immigrants. <ref name="autogenerated1">http://www.fraserinstitute.ca/admin/books/files/Immigration.pdf</ref>
* Language: Isolate themselves in their own communities and refuse to learn the local language. 
* Employment: Acquire jobs which would have otherwise been available to native citizens, suppressing wages. 
* Patriotism: Damage a sense of community and nationality. 
* Environment: Increase the consumption of scarce resources; their move from low to high pollution economy increases pollution
* [[Social welfare provision|Welfare]]: Make heavy use of social welfare systems. 
* [[Overpopulation]]: May overpopulate countries. 
* Culture: Can swamp a native population and replace its culture with their own. 
* Housing: Increase in housing costs: migrant families can reduce vacancies and cause rent increases.  . 

The claim that immigrants can "swamp" a local population is related to [[birth rate]] relative to nationals. Historically, this has occurred only but with immigrants whose societies were more technologically advanced than the native populations. Examples include the immigration of Europeans to North America, the [[Han Chinese]] migration in western China, and the [[Bantu expansion|Bantu migrations]] in Africa. The opposite has also occurred, where small groups managed to dominate and culturally change much larger groups. Such cases include the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], Asian [[Bulgarians]] and Slavic populations dominating the natives of [[Thrace]], the [[Mongol]]s in [[China]] and [[India]], and the [[Germanic peoples]] during the [[migration period]] such as the [[Visigoth]]s, [[Ostrogoth]]s, [[Frank]]s, ''etc.'' over native Romanized populations, as well as the [[Turkish people|Turks]] in [[Anatolia]]. Usually, conquering Germanic barbarian forces were in the beginning ''[[foederati]]'' assisting the Romans.  . 

Contemporary opponents of immigration blame it for such problems as [[unemployment]], [[crime]] (especially through gangs), harm to the [[Natural environment|environment]], and overwhelming social services such as hospitals, police.  . 

==Driving forces behind nativism==. 
{{Globalize/US|date=December 2010}}
Threats involving language, jobs, pay-scales, control of the government, control of borders (and fears of invasion), moral values, and loyalties to racial and ethnic groups, are involved in nativism, with the exact ingredients varying widely.  . 

For example, economic competition and national security are currently (2006) at issue in the United States.  However, it has been pointed out that the poor people who are most economically hurt by illegal immigrants are not usually those who are complaining about it.  . 

While the distinguishing feature of nativism is the opposition between established inhabitants and recently arrived immigrants, the specifics of each situation creates different dynamics.  . 

Often, there are economic tensions caused by the fact that the immigrants are often willing to work harder for less pay, or spend less (saving more and sending money to their home country). Often it is alleged the newcomers form violent gangs, or engage in illegal activities like drugs or prostitution. The allegation dates back to the [[Irish American]] canal gangs (1840s), Chinese gangs ([[tong (organization)|tong]]s) in 1880s, Italian ("[[Mafia]]") (1890–present), and more recently to Russian and Hispanic gangs. The established inhabitants perceive an economic threat caused by lowered wage scales and lower standards of living.  . 

Linguistic, religious, moral, racial/ethnic and cultural differences might be factors.  While there was nativist sentiment in the late 19th century against Catholics from Eastern and Southern Europe, much of this sentiment had subsided by the 1950s as these immigrant groups assimilated into American society and culture.  The nativism of the 1880s focused on Chinese.  In 1890-1920 the focus was on European immigrants.  . 

In some instances, national security concerns can stir up latent nativist tendencies that are not directly associated with economic competition.  Examples of this are the sentiment against German Americans during both World Wars and the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.  Although the internment of [[Japanese American]]s was not directly motivated by economic factors, many Californians took advantage of the situation to profit financially at the expense of the internees.  . 

Despite the national trauma inflicted by the [[9/11]] attacks, there has been remarkably little nativist sentiment in the US targeted against immigrants from Islamic countries.  {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} This can largely be attributed to a vigorous campaign by governmental and civic leaders to discourage a backlash in response to the attacks. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} In Europe, however, there has been a considerable growth of anti-Islamic feeling after the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent attacks in London and Madrid.  .
