There are thousands of '''[[Sudanese refugees]] in Israel''', {{citation needed|date=January 2011}} most of them seeking refuge from ongoing military conflicts in their home country of [[Sudan]]. Because Sudan is defined by Israel as a "hostile state" <ref name="m01789">[http://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/data/docs/m01789.doc ילדים סודנים המבקשים מקלט בישראל]</ref> their official status as refugees is still a highly disputed issue by Israeli authorities, and only several hundred refugees {{ref}} (both Sudanese and [[Eritrea]]n) have been officially recognized as [[refugees]] by the State of Israel.  . 

In 2008 there were 4,000 [[Sudanese]] in [[Israel]], of whom 1,200 were from [[Darfur]] and the rest are [[Christians]] from [[South Sudan]]. The vast majority of them arrived to Israel through the Israeli-Egypt border, and most live in [[Tel-Aviv]], [[Arad, Israel|Arad]], [[Eilat]] <ref>[http://sites.google.com/site/odedfeller/RefugeesBackgroundPaper.pdf?attredirects=0 Refugees background paper]</ref> and [[Bnei Brak]]. <ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/ultra-orthodox-town-of-bnei-brak-moves-to-evict-migrant-workers-1.327780 Ultra-Orthodox town of Bnei Brak moves to evict migrant workers]</ref><ref>[http://www.jeberti.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1107:when-africa-comes-to-israel&catid=57:english When Africa Comes to Israel]</ref> . 

==Background==. 
[[Image:Darfur report - Page 5 Image 1.jpg|200px|thumb|right|An IDP camp in Darfur]]
{{Main|History of Sudan|Second Civil War|War in Darfur}}
The civil wars in Sudan that have been taking place on and off since 1955, the subsequent destabilization and economic collapse caused by the country's infrastructure and economy, and the more recent fighting in Darfur has forced millions of Sudanese civilians to flee their homes and cities. <ref>[http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpPages)/22FB1D4E2B196DAA802570BB005E787C?OpenDocument&count=1000 IDP statistics]</ref> Many refugees currently residing in Israel escaped from the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]], where "war pitted black African separatists and [[Christians]] against a Sudanese government run by [[Muslim]], Arabic-speaking northerners who had tried to impose [[Sharia law|Islamic law]] on the country."</ref> [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/26/AR2006022601309.html]</ref>  1 in 5 Southern Sudanese died in the war, and over 4 million civilians in the South have been given [[Internally displaced person|Internally Displaced Persons]] status. <ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20041210024759/http://www.refugees.org/news/crisis/sudan.htm Refugees in Sudan]</ref>  . 

In 2006, largely owing to the extensive flow of Sudanese and Eritreans crossing into Israel by land from Egypt, Israel witnessed a significant rise in the number of asylum seekers. While in 2005 only 450 applications were registered, the number for 2008 had risen to 7,700. <ref name=UNHCR>{{cite web|last=Afeef|first=Karin|title=A promised land for refugees? Asylum and migration in Israel|url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home/opendocPDFViewer.html?docid=4b2213a59&query=Sudanese refugees in Israel|publisher=International Peace Research Institute}}</ref>  . 

The increase in Sudanese entries to Israel since 2006 is often attributed to the tragic conclusion of the demonstration by Sudanese refugees outside UNHCR‘s offices in Cairo in 2005, where Egyptian police killed 28 asylum seekers in their attempts to end the demonstrations. Additionally, it has been indicated by Sudanese asylum seekers in Israel and Egypt that deteriorating asylum conditions and lack of durable solutions in Egypt has played a major role in their decision to come to Israel. Since the majority of these refugees have been living in Egypt since the 1990s, their crossing into Israel can be described as a case of onward secondary movement. <ref name="UNHCR"/>  . 

Israel is also an attractive destination for asylum seekers as it is often perceived as a bridge to Europe. Moreover, Israel’s strong economy compared to neighboring countries has encouraged asylum seekers to pursue their luck there. <ref name="UNHCR"/> . 

== Legal status ==. 
Israel supported the founding of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, becoming a signatory to the Convention in 1954. But although it actively participated in the development of the international refugee system, Israel did not institute the corresponding legal framework at home. <ref name="UNHCR"/>  . 

Following pressure from UNHCR, a temporary humanitarian protection arrangement was established in 1999, benefiting refugees from war-torn countries in Africa. In 2002, an Israeli asylum procedure was established with the launch of the National Status Granting Body, an inter-ministerial responsible for assessing asylum applications processed by UNHCR Israel, advising the minister of the interior, who held the authority on final decisions. <ref name="UNHCR"/>  . 

However, Israeli authorities have yet to devise and implement a clear approach towards asylum-seekers. Due to authorities’ inexperience with asylum, early official responses to the new arrivals from the Egyptian border included conflicting and ad hoc policies. Finally in July 2008, the government established the Population, Immigration and Border Crossings Authority, responsible for processing asylum requests and determining refugee-status. In July 2009, Israeli authorities officially took over this responsibility from UNHCR, and since then asylum policies have become clearer. <ref name="UNHCR"/>  . 

It is apparent that the Israeli government has been pursuing two differing approaches. While authorities have granted temporary protection, assistance, and work permits for asylum seekers, they have also detained thousands and even forced return of hundreds of Sudanese and other African asylum seekers back to Egypt (UNHCR, 11). The lack of a clear vision and confusion on the asylum issue stems, to a large extent, from a lack of leadership and internal strife between governmental departments. <ref name="UNHCR"/> . 

Among Sudanese refugees in Israel, 850 are asking for asylum from persecution in Sudan, including 200 children. <ref name="m01789" /> The fact that Israel and Sudan lack diplomatic relations have complicated the status of Sudanese asylum seekers. Since Sudan is considered by Israel as an "enemy state" {{ref}}, many Sudanese refugees have been detained according to Israeli Law. But detainees were sometime released in order to make room for new arrivals. Additionally, Sudanese who managed to enter Israel without being spotted by Israeli authorities also avoided detention if they managed to register with UNHCR in Tel Aviv. At the same time, Israeli authorities have partnered with UNHCR in Israel to grant some form of temporary protection for thousands of asylum seekers in the country, even granting them, to a certain degree, access to some social services and seek employment. <ref name="UNHCR"/> . 

Although Israel has legally barred its citizens from employing Sudanese asylum seekers, it does not enforce the ban, as it is in the authorities’ interest for asylum seekers to support themselves financially. <ref>{{cite web|title=African refugees hired to build fence to keep migrants out of Israel|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/african-refugees-hired-to-build-fence-to-keep-migrants-out-of-israel-1.348212|publisher=Haaretz}}</ref>  . 

According to [[Supreme Court of Israel]] decision from 13 January 2011,<ref>[http://news.walla.co.il/?w=/1/1782313 בג"צ קבע: אסור לקנוס מעסיקי פליטים]</ref><ref>[http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files/10/120/063/b06/10063120.b06.htm Supreme court resolution]</ref> the [[employer]]s of refugeees and asylum seekers will not be [[Fine (penalty)|fined]]; thus, de-facto, they can legally work in Israel.  . 

== Way to Israel ==. 
The journey to Israel has proved extremely dangerous. In 2008–2009, around 30 migrants were shot and killed by Egyptian security forces as they attempted to cross into Israel. <ref name=UNHCR>{{cite web|last=Afeef|first=Karin|url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home/opendocPDFViewer.html?docid=4b2213a59&query=Sudanese refugees in Israel|publisher=International Peace Research Institute}}</ref> In addition, many African migrants en route to Israel face torture, organ theft, rape and assault by traffickers in the Sinai who hold them for weeks, sometimes months, to demand more money. A survey of 284 migrants published in late February 2011 found that over half told of abuse by the smugglers that included being burnt, branded, hung by the hands or feet and raped. <ref name="Haaretz">{{cite web|title=Egypt turmoil cuts African migration to Israel|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/egypt-turmoil-cuts-african-migration-to-israel-1.346507|publisher=Haaretz}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sinai smugglers raped dozens of African women wanting to enter Israel|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/report-sinai-smugglers-raped-dozens-of-african-women-wanting-to-enter-israel-1.345313|publisher=Haaretz}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Majority of asylum-seekers in Israel are seriously abused in Sinai|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/majority-of-asylum-seekers-in-israel-are-seriously-abused-in-sinai-report-reveals-1.345220|publisher=Haaretz}}</ref>  . 

Anxious due to a near-doubling in the flow of African seeking refugee status, in 2010 Israel began building a fence along the border and publicized plans to build a detention facility for border-jumpers. <ref name="Haaretz"/>  . 

In spite of the risks and abusive treatment by smugglers, smuggler networks run by various Bedouin groups in the Sinai desert have extended their operations in recent years, transporting growing numbers of Sudanese and other African asylum seekers across to Israel. <ref name="UNHCR"/> . 

== Conditions in Israel ==. 
There are approximately 2,000 asylum seekers (from different countries) who are currently being held at various imprisonment facilities in Israel; 1,500 of these are being held at [[Ktzi'ot Prison|Ketziot Military Prison]]. Approximately 13,000 asylum seekers are concentrated in Tel Aviv, Eilat, and Arad, while the remainder is dispersed in moshavim, kibbutzim, and cities. <ref name="acri_2009">[http://www.acri.org.il/eng/story.aspx?id=676 Asylum Seekers and Refugees in Israel: August 2009 Update]</ref> . 

The majority of asylum seekers are healthy young men, since otherwise they would have had difficulty surviving the protracted and harsh journey they have endured to reach Israel. However, the population of asylum seekers also includes several hundred women and almost 2,000 children and minors. Although their physical condition is fair, many of the asylum seekers suffer from trauma as the result of the severe experiences they have undergone prior to reaching Israel. 
<ref name="acri_2009"/> . 

== Reactions in Israel ==. 
[[File:Meeting between Sudanese refugees and Israeli students.jpg|thumb|right|Meeting between Sudanese refugees and Israeli students, 2007]]
There are mixed reaction in Israel: there are demonstrations for both support refugees,<ref>[http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/7708463-african-refugees-protest-in-israel African Refugees Protest in Israel]</ref><ref>[http://www.nowpublic.com/world/african-refugees-demonstrate-tel-aviv African Refugees Demonstrate in Tel Aviv]</ref> and against <ref>[http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3768334,00.html Arad residents protest against refugees]</ref><ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/hundreds-protest-against-presence-of-foreigners-refugees-in-south-tel-aviv-1.331908 Hundreds protest against presence of foreigners, refugees in south Tel Aviv], [[haaretz]]</ref> them.  . 

Unlike the authorities’ unclear approach towards asylum seekers, Israeli NGOs support for this group has been clear and noteworthy. Since the influx of asylum seekers crossing through Egypt, numerous Israeli NGOs and civil society have been actively involved in advocating for this group’s rights, challenging government policies, placing the refugee issue issue on the political agenda, and providing social services such as shelter, food, and medical support. However, the NGOs’ determination and dedication to provide social services has to some degree permitted the Israeli government’s inaction on the asylum issue. <ref name="UNHCR"/> . 

== Recent Developments ==. 
According to the Israeli Interior Ministry, the number of African migrants entering Israel illegally through Egypt has fallen drastically since Egyptian political upheaval began in January, 2011. Around 700 migrants entered Israel in January and February, less than half the average monthly number in 2010. The decrease in migrant flow is attributed to the increased violence in the Sinai desert between Egyptian police and Bedouin smugglers. <ref name="Haaretz"/> . 

Following the independence of [[South Sudan]] in July 2011, the Sudanese refugee population in Israel is likely to decline as refugees from the war-torn area return as citizens. However, it is just as likely that many South Sudanese refugees may stay in Israel for economic reasons, as South Sudan is a resource-rich but economically-poor nation and the SPLA, which now governs the country, is engaged in [[South Kordofan conflict|tensions over South Kordofan]]. The conflict in Darfur continues to drive refugees out of that region of Sudan as well.  . 

In February 2012, Israel's Interior Ministry announced that South Sudanese nationals must repatriate by March, arguing they no longer need protection since South Sudan gained independence. They will be given $1,300 and a plane ticket if they voluntarily resettle, but any who do not repatriate will be deported. <ref>{{cite news|title=South Sudanese refugees must leave Israel|url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2012/02/01/3091457/south-sudanese-refugees-must-leave-israel|accessdate=5 February 2012|newspaper=The Global News Service of the Jewish People|date=1 February 2012}}</ref> .
