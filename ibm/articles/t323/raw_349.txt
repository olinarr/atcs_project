The '''Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees''' ('''UNHCR'''), also known as '''The UN Refugee Agency''' is a [[United Nations]] agency mandated to protect and support [[refugee]]s at the request of a government or the UN itself and assists in their voluntary repatriation, local integration or resettlement to a third country. Its headquarters are in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] and is a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]]. <ref>http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13</ref> The UNHCR has won two [[Nobel Peace Prize]]s, once in 1954 and again in 1981. <ref name="NobelFactsorg">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/organizations.html|title=Nobel Laureates Facts – Organizations|publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-10-13}}</ref> . 

==History== . 

Following the demise of the [[League of Nations]] and the formation of the [[United Nations]], the international community were acutely aware of the refugee crisis following the end of [[World War II]].  In 1947, the [[International Refugee Organization]](IRO) was founded by the United Nations. <ref name="unhcr.org">http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/4214cb4f2.html</ref> The IRO was the first international agency to deal comprehensively with all aspects pertaining to refugees' lives. Preceding this was the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]], which was established in 1944 to address the millions of people displaced through Europe as a result of World War II. <ref name="unhcr.org"/> . 

In the late 1940s, the IRO fell out of favour, but the United Nations agreed that a body was required to oversee global refugee issues. Despite many heated debates in the General Assembly, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was founded as a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly by resolution Resolution 319 (IV) of the United Nations General Assembly of December 1949. However, the organization was only intended to operate for 3 years, from January 1951, due to the disagreement of many UN member states over the implications of a permanent body. <ref name="unhcr.org"/> . 

UNHCR's mandate was originally set out in its Statute, annexed to Resolution 428 (V) of the United Nations General Assembly of 1950. This mandate has been subsequently broadened by numerous resolutions of the General Assembly and its Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). <ref name="unhcr.org"/> According to UNHCR, . 

<blockquote>[its] mandate is to provide, on a non-political and humanitarian basis, international protection to refugees and to seek permanent solutions for them. <ref name="unhcr.org"/></blockquote> . 

Soon after the signing of the [[1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]], it became clear that refugees were not solely restricted to Europe. In 1956, UNHCR was involved in coordinating the response to the uprising in [[Hungary]]. Just a year later, UNHCR was tasked with dealing with Chinese refugees in [[Hong Kong]], while also responding Algerian refugees who had fled to [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]] in the wake of [[Algeria]]'s war for independence. The responses marked the beginning of a wider, global mandate in refugee protection and humanitarian assistance. <ref name="unhcr.org"/> . 

Decolonization in the 1960s triggered large refugee movements in Africa, creating a massive challenge that would transform UNHCR; unlike the refugee crises in Europe, there were no durable solutions in Africa and many refugees who fled one country only found instability in their new country of asylum. By the end of the decade, two thirds of UNCHR's budget was focused on operations in Africa and in just one decade, the organization's focus had shifted from an almost exclusive focus on Europe. <ref name="unhcr.org"/> . 

In the 1970s, UNHCR refugee operations continued to spread around the globe, with the mass exodus of East Pakistanis to [[India]] shortly before the birth of [[Bangladesh]]. Adding to the woes in Asia was the [[Vietnam]] war, with millions fleeing the war-torn country. <ref name="unhcr.org"/> . 

The 1980s saw new challenges for UNHCR, with many member states unwilling to resettle refugees due to the sharp rise in refugee numbers over the 1970s. Often, these refugees were not fleeing wars between states, but inter-ethnic conflict in newly independent states. The targeting of civilians as military strategy added to the displacement in many nations, so even 'minor' conflicts could result in a large number of displaced persons. Whether in Asia, Central America or Africa, these conflicts, fueled by superpower rivalry and aggravated by socio-economic problems within the concerned countries, durale solutions continued to prove a massive challenge for the UNHCR. As a result, the UNHCR became more heavily involved with assistance programs within refugee camps, often located in hostile environments. <ref name="unhcr.org"/> . 

The end of the [[Cold War]] marked continued inter-ethnic conflict and contributed heavily to refugee flight. In addition, humanitarian intervention by multinational forces became more frequent and the media began to play a big role, particularly in the lead up to the 1999 [[NATO]] mission in [[Yugoslavia]], while by contrast, the [[1994 Rwandan Genocide]] had little attention. The genocide in Rwanda caused a massive refugee crisis, again highlighting the difficulties for UNHCR to uphold its mandate, and the UNHCR continued to battle against restrictive asylum policies in so called 'rich' nations. <ref name="unhcr.org"/> .

UNHCR was established on 14 December 1950<ref name="History">{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49c3646cbc.html|title=History of UNHCR: A global humanitarian organization of humble origins|publisher=UNHCR|accessdate=2009-11-01}}</ref> and succeeded the earlier [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]]. The agency is mandated to lead and co-ordinate international action to protect refugees and resolve refugee problems worldwide. Its primary purpose is to safeguard the rights and well-being of refugees. It strives to ensure that everyone can exercise the right to seek [[refugee|asylum]] and find safe refuge in another state, with the option to return home voluntarily, integrate locally or to resettle in a third country.  . 

UNHCR's mandate has gradually been expanded to include protecting and providing humanitarian assistance to whom it describes as other persons "of concern," including [[internally displaced person]]s (IDPs) who would fit the legal definition of a [[refugee]] under the 1951 [[United Nations]] [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] and 1967 Protocol, the 1969 Organization for African Unity Convention, or some other treaty if they left their country, but who presently remain in their country of origin. UNHCR presently has major missions in [[Lebanon]], South [[Sudan]], [[Chad]]/[[Darfur]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]] as well as [[Kenya]] to assist and provide services to IDPs and refugees.  . 

===Palestine refugee mandate===. 
{{Main|United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East}}
Most [[Palestinian refugees]] – those in the [[West Bank]], [[Gaza Strip]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], and [[Jordan]] – do not come within the responsibility of the UNHCR, but instead come under an older body, the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East]] (UNRWA). But Palestinian refugees outside of UNRWA's area of operations do fall under UNHCR's mandate, if they meet the UNHCR's more limited definition of refugee.  . 

===Public awareness===. 
Several new programmes have recently been introduced to support and to heighten awareness of the issues faced by refugees around the world. 
These two new programs are a product of the benchmarks set out by the [[United Nations Millennium Development Goals]].  . 

===Awards===. 
UNHCR was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1954 and 1981.  .
