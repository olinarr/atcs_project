'''Immigration''' (derived from [[Latin language|Latin]]: ''migratio'') is the act of [[alien (law)|foreigners]] passing or coming into a country for the purpose of permanent residence.  Immigration is made for many reasons, including economic, political, family re-unification, natural disaster, poverty or the wish to change one's surroundings voluntarily.  . 

==Statistics==. 
The [[International Organization for Migration]] (IOM) stated there are more than 200-million migrants around the world today. [[Europe]] hosted the largest number of immigrants, with 70.6 million people in 2005. [[North America]], with over 45.1 million immigrants, is second, followed by [[Asia]], which hosts nearly 25.3 million. Most of today's migrant workers come from Asia. <ref name="foxnews"/> . 

The United Nations found that, in 2005, there were nearly 191 million international migrants worldwide, about 3 percent of the world population. <ref name="nytimes"/> This represented a rise of 26 million since 1990. Sixty percent of these immigrants were now in developed countries, an increase on 1990. Those in less developed countries stagnated, mainly because of a fall in refugees. <ref name="UN2006"/> Contrast that to the average rate of globalization (the proportion of cross-border trade in all trade), which exceeds 20 percent. The numbers of people living outside their country of birth is expected to rise in the future. <ref name="International Migration Report 2006"/> . 

The Middle West (USA), some parts of Europe, small areas of South West Asia, and a few spots in the East Indies have the highest percentages of immigrant population recorded by the UN Census 2005. The reliability of immigrant censuses is low due to the concealed character of undocumented labor migration. The [[International Organization for Migration]] has estimated the number of foreign migrants to be over 200 million worldwide today. <ref name="iom"/> . 

===2009 survey===. 
A 2009 survey by [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] found roughly 700 million adults would like to migrate to another country permanently if they had the chance. <ref name="gallup1"/> Nearly one-quarter (24%) of these respondents, which translates to more than 165 million adults worldwide, named the United States as their desired future residence, while an additional 6.5% of respondents, representing an estimated 45 million, chose [[Canada]]. The other top desired destination countries (those where an estimated 25 million or more adults would like to go) were predominantly European. A percentage of respondents representing forty-five million adults named the United Kingdom or France as their desired destination, followed in order of preference by Spain, Germany, Saudi Arabia and Australia.  .

At the same time Turkey’s political, social and economic conditions have been improving, making returning home all the more appealing for Turks at large (pp.&nbsp;94–99).  . 

==Understanding of immigration==. 
===General theories behind immigration===. 
One theory of immigration distinguishes between Push and Pull. <ref name="knaw"/> Push factors refer primarily the motive for [[emigration]] from the country of origin. In the case of economic migration (usually labor migration), differentials in [[wage rate]]s are usual. If the value of wages in the new country surpasses the value of wages in one’s native country, he or she may choose to migrate as long as the costs are not too high. Particularly in the 19th century, economic expansion of the U.S. increased immigrant flow, and in effect, nearly 20% of the population was [[foreign born]] versus today’s values of 10%, making up a significant amount of the labor force. Poor individuals from less developed countries ''can'' have far higher standards of living in developed countries than in their originating countries. The cost of emigration, which includes both the explicit costs, the ticket price, and the implicit cost, lost work time and loss of community ties, also play a major role in the pull of emigrants away from their native country. As transportation technology improved, travel time and costs decreased dramatically between the 18th and early 20th century. Travel across the Atlantic used to take up to 5 weeks in the 18th century, but around the time of the 20th century it took a mere 8 days. <ref name="autogenerated2"/> When the [[opportunity cost]] is lower, the immigration rates tend to be higher. <ref name=autogenerated2 /> Escape from [[poverty]] (personal or for relatives staying behind) is a traditional push factor, the availability of [[employment|jobs]] is the related pull factor. [[Natural disasters]] can amplify poverty-driven migration flows. This kind of migration may be [[illegal immigration]] in the destination country (emigration is also illegal in some countries, such as [[North Korea]], [[Myanmar]], and [[Cuba]]). 
[[File:DMZ - Freedom Building.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Freedom Building, a large building built on the South Korean side of the DMZ to hold reunification meetings between families separated by the Korean War]]
Emigration and immigration are sometimes mandatory in a contract of employment: religious [[Missionary|missionaries]], and employees of [[transnational corporations]], international [[non-governmental organizations]] and the [[diplomatic service]] expect, by definition, to work 'overseas'. They are often referred to as '[[expatriates]]', and their conditions of employment are typically equal to or better than those applying in the host country (for similar work).  . 

For some migrants, [[education]] is the primary pull factor (although most [[international students]] are not classified as immigrants). [[Retirement]] migration from rich countries to lower-cost countries with better [[climate]] is a new type of international migration. Examples include immigration of retired [[United Kingdom|British]] citizens to [[Spain]] or [[Italy]] and of retired [[Canadian]] citizens to the [[United States|U.S.]] (mainly to the U.S. states of [[Florida]] and [[Texas]]).  . 

Non-economic push factors include [[persecution]] (religious and otherwise), frequent abuse, [[bullying]], [[oppression]], [[ethnic cleansing]] and even [[genocide]], and risks to civilians during [[war]]. Political motives traditionally motivate refugee flows—to escape [[dictatorship]] for instance.  . 

Some migration is for personal reasons, based on a [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] (e.g. to be with family or a partner), such as in [[family reunification]] or [[transnational marriage]] (especially in the instance of a [[gender imbalance]]). In a few cases, an individual may wish to immigrate to a new country in a form of transferred [[patriotism]]. Evasion of [[criminal justice]] (e.g. avoiding [[arrest]]) is a personal motivation. This type of emigration and immigration is not normally legal, if a crime is internationally recognized, although criminals may disguise their identities or find other loopholes to evade detection. There have been cases, for example, of those who might be guilty of war crimes disguising themselves as victims of war or conflict and then pursuing asylum in a different country.  . 

Barriers to immigration come not only in legal form; natural and social barriers to immigration can also be very powerful. Immigrants when leaving their country also leave everything familiar: their family, friends, support network, and culture. They also need to liquidate their assets often at a large loss,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} and incur the expense of moving. When they arrive in a new country this is often with many uncertainties including finding work, where to live, new laws, new cultural norms, language or accent issues, possible [[racism]] and other exclusionary behavior towards them and their family. These barriers act to limit international migration (scenarios where populations move ''en masse'' to other continents, creating huge population surges, and their associated strain on infrastructure and services, ignore these inherent limits on migration.)
[[File:Cizov opona.JPG|thumb|260px|The [[Iron Curtain]] in Europe was designed as a means of [[Eastern Bloc emigration and defection|preventing emigration]]. "It is one of the ironies of post-war European history that, once the freedom to travel for [[Europeans]] living under communist regimes, which had long been demanded by the West, was finally granted in 1989/90, travel was very soon afterwards made much more difficult by the West itself, and new barriers were erected to replace the Iron Curtain."  —Anita Böcker<ref>Anita Böcker (1998) [http://books.google.com/books?id=ejOg0L5pbHUC&pg=&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''Regulation of migration: international experiences'']. Het Spinhuis. p.218. ISBN 9055890952</ref>]]
The politics of immigration have become increasingly associated with other issues, such as [[national security]], [[terrorism]], and in western Europe especially, with the presence of [[Islam]] as a new major religion. Those with security concerns cite the [[2005 civil unrest in France]] that point to the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]] as an example of the value conflicts arising from immigration of [[Muslims in Western Europe]]. Because of all these associations, immigration has become an emotional political issue in many European nations.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} . 

Studies have suggested that some [[special interest group]]s [[Lobbying|lobby]] for less immigration for their own group and more immigration for other groups since they see effects of immigration, such as increased labor competition, as detrimental when affecting their own group but beneficial when affecting other groups. A 2010 European study suggested that "that employers are more likely to be pro-immigration than employees, provided that immigrants are thought to compete with employees who are already in the country. Or else, when immigrants are thought to compete with employers rather than employees, employers are more likely to be anti-immigration than employees."<ref name="ssrn"/> A 2011 study examining the voting of US representatives on migration policy suggests that "that representatives from more skilled labor abundant districts are more likely to support an open immigration policy towards the unskilled, whereas the opposite is true for representatives from more unskilled labor abundant districts."<ref name="jpubeco"/> . 

Another contributing factor may be lobbying by earlier immigrants. The Chairman for the US Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform which lobby for more permissive rules for immigrants, as well as special arrangements just for Irish, has stated that "the Irish Lobby will push for any special arrangement it can get — 'as will every other ethnic group in the country.'"<ref name="irishlobbyusa"/><ref name="nclr"/> . 

===Region-specific factors for immigration===. 
As a principle, citizens of one member nation of the [[European Union]] are allowed to work in other member nations with little to no restriction on movement. <ref name="Eures - Free Movement"/> This is aided by the [[EURES]] network which brings together the [[European Commission]] and the public employment services of the countries belonging to the [[European Economic Area]] and [[Switzerland]]. For non-EU-citizen permanent residents in the EU, movement between EU-member states is considerably more difficult. After 155 new waves of accession to the European Union, earlier members have often introduced measures to restrict participation in "their" labour markets by citizens of the new EU-member states. For instance, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain each restricted their labor market for up to seven years both in the 2004 and 2007 round of accession. <ref name="migration_information"/> . 

Due to the European Union's—in principle—single internal labour market policy, countries such as [[Italy]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]] that have seen relatively low levels of labour immigration until recently (and which have often sent a significant portion of their population overseas in the past) are now seeing an influx of immigrants from EU countries with lower per capita annual earning rates, triggering nationwide immigration debates. <ref name="independent"/><ref name="cicerofoundation"/>
[[Spain]], meanwhile, is seeing growing illegal immigration from [[Africa]]. As Spain is the closest EU member nation to Africa—Spain even has two autonomous cities ([[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]) on the African continent, as well as an autonomous community (the [[Canary Islands]]) west of North Africa, in the Atlantic—it is physically easiest for African emigrants to reach. This has led to debate both within Spain and between Spain and other EU members. Spain has asked for border control assistance from other EU states; the latter have responded that Spain has brought the wave of African illegal migrants on itself by granting amnesty to hundreds of thousands of undocumented foreigners. <ref name="BBC: EU nations clash over immigration"/> . 

The [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and [[Germany]] have seen major immigration since the end of World War II and have been debating the issue for decades. Foreign workers were brought in to those countries to help rebuild after the war, and many stayed. Political debates about immigration typically focus on statistics, the immigration law and policy, and the implementation of existing restrictions. <ref name="Deutsche Welle: Germans Consider U.S. Experience in Immigration Debate"/><ref name="BBC: Short History of Immigration"/> In some European countries the debate in the 1990s was focused on asylum seekers, but restrictive policies within the European Union, as well as a reduction in armed conflict in Europe and neighboring regions, have sharply reduced asylum seekers. <ref name="BBC: Analysis: Europe's asylum trends"/> . 

Some states, such as [[Japan]], have opted for technological changes to increase profitability (for example, greater [[automation]]), and designed immigration laws specifically to prevent immigrants from coming to, and remaining within, the country. Globalization, as well as low birth rates and an aging work force, has forced Japan to reconsider its immigration policy. <ref name="Japanese Immigration Policy: Responding to Conflicting Pressures"/> Japan's colonial past has also created considerable number of non-Japanese in Japan. Japan keeps tight control on immigration and in 2009, despite generous overseas aid for refugees, granted political asylum to just 30 people. <ref name="google"/> Japanese Minister [[Taro Aso]] described Japan as unique in being "one nation, one civilisation, one language, one culture and one race". <ref name="guardian" /> . 

In the United States political debate on immigration has flared repeatedly since the US became independent.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Some on the far-left of the political spectrum attribute anti-immigration rhetoric to an all-"white", under-educated and parochial minority of the population, ill-educated about the relative advantages of immigration for the US economy and society. <ref name="cmd.princeton.edu"/>  While those on the far-right think that immigration threatens [[national identity]], as well as cheapening labor and increasing dependence on [[welfare]]. <ref name="cmd.princeton.edu"/> . 

==Economic migrant==. 
[[Image:Indo-Bangladeshi Barrier.JPG|right|thumb|280px|The [[Bangladesh–India border|Indo-Bangladeshi barrier]] in 2007. [[India]] is building a fence along the 4,000 kilometer border with Bangladesh to prevent illegal immigration.]] . 

The term economic migrant refers to someone who has emigrated from one region to another region for the purposes of seeking employment or improved financial position. An economic migrant is distinct from someone who is a [[refugee]] fleeing persecution.  . 

Many countries have immigration and visa restrictions that prohibit a person entering the country for the purposes of gaining work without a valid work visa. Persons who are declared an economic migrant can be refused entry into a country.  . 

The [[World Bank]] estimates that [[remittance]]s totaled $420 billion in 2009, of which $317 billion went to developing countries. <ref name="worldbank"/> . 

==Ethics== . 

Treatment of migrants in host countries, both by governments, employers, and original population, is a topic of continual debate and criticism, as many cases of abuse and violation of rights are being reported frequently. Some countries have developed a particularly notorious reputation regarding treatment of migrants. The [[United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families]], has been ratified but by 20 states, all of which are heavy exporters of cheap labor. With the sole exception of [[Serbia]], non of the signatories are western countries, but all are from [[Asia]], [[South America]], and [[North Africa]]. [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]], which are known for receiving millions of migrant workers, have not signed the treaty as well. 
Although [[freedom of movement]] is often recognized as a [[civil right]]{{Who|date=July 2011}}, the freedom only applies to movement within national borders: it may be guaranteed by the [[constitution]] or by human rights legislation. Additionally, this freedom is often limited to [[citizen]]s and excludes others. No [[Sovereign state|state]] currently allows full freedom of movement across its borders, and international [[human rights]] treaties do not confer a general right to enter another state. Proponents of immigration maintain that, according to Article 13 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], everyone has the right to leave or enter a country, along with movement within it (internal migration), although article 13 actually restricts freedom of movement to "within the borders of each state." Additionally, the UDHR does not mention entry into other countries when it states that "everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country."<ref name="The Universal Declaration of Human Rights"/> Some argue that the freedom of movement both within and between countries is a basic human right, and that the restrictive immigration policies, typical of nation-states, violate this human right of freedom of movement. <ref name="immigration"/> Such arguments are common among anti-state ideologies like [[anarchism]] and [[libertarianism]]. 
As philosopher and "Open Borders" activist [[Jacob M. Appel|Jacob Appel]] has written, "Treating human beings differently, simply because they were born on the opposite side of a national boundary, is hard to justify under any mainstream philosophical, religious or ethical theory."<ref name="opposingviews"/> However, Article 14 does provide that "everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution."<ref name="The Universal Declaration of Human Rights1"/>  . 

Where immigration is permitted, it is typically selective. [[Family reunification]] accounts for approximately two-thirds of legal immigration to the US every year. <ref name="migrationinformation2"/> Ethnic selection, such as the [[White Australia policy]], has generally disappeared, but priority is usually given to the educated, skilled, and wealthy. Less privileged individuals, including the mass of poor people in low-income countries, cannot avail themselves of the legal and protected immigration opportunities offered by wealthy states. This inequality has also been criticized as conflicting with the principle of [[equal opportunities]], which apply (at least in theory) within democratic nation-states. The fact that the door is closed for the unskilled, while at the same time many developed countries have a huge demand for unskilled labor, is a major factor in [[illegal immigration]]. The contradictory nature of this policy—which specifically disadvantages the unskilled immigrants while exploiting their labor—has also been criticized on ethical grounds.  . 

Immigration policies which selectively grant freedom of movement to targeted individuals are intended to produce a net economic gain for the host country. They can also mean net loss for a poor donor country through the loss of the educated minority—the [[brain drain]]. This can exacerbate the [[Global justice|global inequality]] in [[standards of living]] that provided the motivation for the individual to migrate in the first place. One example of competition for skilled labour is active recruitment of [[health worker]]s from the [[Third World]] by [[First World]] countries.  .

===Asia===. 
====Israel====. 
[[File:Meeting between Sudanese refugees and Israeli students.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Meeting between Sudanese refugees and Israeli students, 2007. Only Jewish immigrants automatically acquire [[Israeli citizenship]].]]
[[Jewish]] immigration to [[Palestine]] during the 19th century was promoted by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] journalist [[Theodor Herzl]] in the late 19th century following the publication of "[[Der Judenstaat]]". <ref name="paperbacks"/> His [[Zionist]] movement sought to encourage [[Aliyah|Jewish migration]], or immigration, to [[Palestine]].  Its proponents regard its aim as [[self-determination]] for the Jewish people. <ref name="archive"/>
The percentage of world Jewry living in the former [[Palestinian Mandate]] has steadily grown from 25,000 since the movement came into existence. Today about 40% of the world's Jews live in Israel, more than in any other country. <ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary"/>  . 

The Israeli [[Law of Return]], passed in 1950, gives  those born Jews (having a Jewish mother or grandmother), those with Jewish ancestry (having a Jewish father or grandfather) and converts to Judaism (Orthodox, Reform, or Conservative denominations—not secular—though Reform and Conservative conversions must take place outside the state, similar to civil marriages) the right to immigrate to Israel. A 1970 amendment, extended immigration rights to "a child and a grandchild of a Jew, the spouse of a Jew, the spouse of a child of a Jew and the spouse of a grandchild of a Jew". Over a million Jews from the former Soviet Union have immigrated to Israel since the 1990s, and large numbers of [[Ethiopian Jews]] were airlifted to the country in [[Operation Moses]]. In the year 1991, Israel helped 14,000 Ethiopian immigrants arrive in operation Solomon.  . 

Nearly 34,000 African migrants have entered Israel in recent{{specify|date=November 2011}} years. <ref>"[http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/flow-of-african-migrants-poses-dilemma-for-israel/2011/04/14/AFsxuyjD_story.html Flow of African migrants poses dilemma for Israel]", The Washington Post, 15 April 2011</ref> There were 35,638 migrants in Israel in 2011. <ref>"[http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=227332 Danny Danon: Send African migrants to Australia]". Jerusalem Post. June 30, 2011. </ref> . 

====Japan====. 
{{See also|Demographics of Japan}}
[[File:Shibuya night.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Japan]]'s population is very homogenous because of the tight control it has had on immigration.]]
In the early 1990s, Japan relaxed its relatively tight immigration laws to allow special entry permits for foreigners of [[Japanese diaspora|Japanese]] ancestry in [[South America]] to make up for a labor shortage. <ref name="msn"/> According to Japanese immigration centre,<ref name="xvq"/> the number of foreign residents in Japan has steadily increased, and the number of foreign residents (including [[permanent resident]]s, but excluding [[illegal immigrant]]s and [[tourist|short-term visitors]] such as foreign nationals staying less than 90 days in Japan<ref name="sarkaroffice"/>) was more than 2.2 million in 2008. <ref name="xvq" /> The biggest groups are [[Koreans in Japan|Koreans]] (both south and north), Chinese (including [[People's Republic of China]], [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] nationalities), and Brazilians. Most of the Brazilians in Japan have [[Japanese Brazilian|Japanese]] ancestry due to the huge Japanese immigration to Brazil in the first decades of the 20th century. Immediately after [[World War II]], most Koreans in Japan were formerly conscripted as [[Japanese war crimes#Forced labor|forced labour]] during the war. <ref name="nytimes3"/> . 

Among the immigrants, Japan accepts a steady flow of 15,000 new Japanese citizens by {{nihongo|naturalization|帰化|kika}} per year. <ref name="moj"/> Indeed, the concept of ''ethnic groups'' by the Japanese statistics is different from that used in North American or some Western European statistics. For example, [[the United Kingdom]] Census asks about its citizens' "ethnic or racial background". <ref name="United Kingdom population by ethnic group"/> The Japanese Statistics Bureau does not ask this question. Since the Japanese census asks about nationality rather than ethnicity, naturalized Japanese citizens and Japanese nationals with multi-ethnic backgrounds are considered simply to be [[Japanese people|Japanese]] in the population of Japan. <ref name="xvq" /> . 

According to the Japanese Association for Refugees, the number of [[refugee]]s who applied to live in Japan has rapidly increased since 2006,<ref name="qvx"/> and there were more than a thousand applications in 2008. <ref name="qvx" /> Japan's refugee policy has been criticized both domestically{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} and internationally{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} because the number of refugees accepted into Japan is small compared to countries such as [[Canada]] and [[France]]. For example, according to the [[UNHCR]], in 1999 Japan accepted 16 refugees for resettlement, while the [[United States]] took in 85,010, and [[New Zealand]] (which is smaller{{clarify|size or population?|date=January 2012}} than Japan) accepted 1,140. Between 1981, when Japan ratified the [[U.N.]] [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]], and 2002, Japan recognized only 305 persons as refugees. <ref name="findarticles"/><ref name="iwanami"/> . 

===Europe===. 
{{Main|Immigration to Europe}}
[[File:Arrivo di clandestini nel mare di Lampedusa.JPG|thumb|Arrival of immigrants in the sea of [[Lampedusa]], Italy. More than 45,000 African [[boat people]] arrived on Lampedusa in the first five months of 2011.]]
According to [[Eurostat]], 47.3 million people lived in the EU in 2010, who were born outside their resident country. This corresponds to 9.4% of the total EU population. Of these, 31.4 million (6.3%) were born outside the EU and 16.0 million (3.2%) were born in another EU member state. The largest absolute numbers of people born outside the EU were in Germany (6.4 million), France (5.1 million), the United Kingdom (4.7 million),  Spain (4.1 million), Italy (3.2 million), and the Netherlands (1.4 million). <ref>[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-11-034/EN/KS-SF-11-034-EN.PDF 6.5% of the EU population are foreigners and 9.4% are born abroad], Eurostat, Katya VASILEVA, 34/2011. </ref><ref name="europa"/> . 

Some EU member states are currently receiving large-scale immigration: for instance [[Spain]], where the economy has created more than the whole of all the new jobs in the EU over the past five years. <ref name="Article on Spanish Immigration"/> The EU, in 2005, had an overall net gain from international migration of +1.8 million people. This accounts for almost 85% of Europe's total population growth in 2005. <ref name="Europe: Population and Migration in 2005"/> In 2004, total 140,033 people immigrated to [[France]]. Of them, 90,250 were from [[Africa]] and 13,710 from [[Europe]]. <ref name="Inflow of third-country nationals by country of nationality"/> In 2005, immigration fell slightly to 135,890. <ref name="migrationpolicy"/>
British emigration towards [[Southern Europe]] is of special relevance. Citizens from the European Union make up a growing proportion of immigrants in [[Spain]]. They mainly come from countries like the UK and Germany, but the British case is of special interest due to its magnitude. The British authorities estimate that the British population in Spain at 700,000. <ref name="British Immigrants Swamping Spanish Villages?"/>
Mid- and long term EU demographics indicate a shortage of skilled laborers on a scale that would endanger economic growth and the stability of numerous industries. For this reason the European Union launched an initiative called the EU Blue Card, In 2009. The EU Blue Card is initially a temporary residence and work permit. However it will offer holders the opportunity to apply for a permanent resident permit after working on a EU Blue Card for two to five years uninterrupted, depending on individual member state regulations. In the years ahead, EU member states will gradually accept applications for EU Blue Card. Crucial in the application process is a job contract with an EU-based organization. To facilitate this requirement the European Commission launched the EU Blue Card Database in January 2010. <ref name="apply"/> . 

====Italy====. 
{{Main|Immigration to Italy}}
Italy now has an estimated 4 million to 4.5 million immigrants — about 8 percent of the population. 
Since the expansion of the European Union, the most recent wave of migration has been from surrounding European nations, particularly Central  Europe, and increasingly Asia, replacing North Africa as the major immigration area. Some 997,000 Romanians are officially registered as living in Italy, replacing Albanians (590,000) and Moroccans (455,000) as the largest ethnic minority group, but independent estimates put the actual number of Romanians at double that figure or perhaps even more. Other immigrants from Central and Eastern Europe are Ukrainians (260,000), Polish (120,000), Moldovans (190 000) Macedonians (100,000), Serbs (75,000), Bulgarians (124,000), Bosnians (40,000), Russians (45,600), Croatians (25,000), Slovakians (9,000), Hungarians (8,600). As of 2009, the foreign born population origin of Italy was subdivided as follows: Europe (53.5%), Africa (22.3%), Asia (15.8%), the Americas (8.1%) and Oceania (0.06%). The distribution of foreign born population is largely uneven in Italy: 80 % of immigrants live in the northern and central parts of the country (the most economically developed areas), while only 20 % live in the southern half of the peninsula. In 2008, net immigration to Italy was 438,000.  . 

====Norway====. 
{{Main|Immigration to Norway}}
In recent years{{specify|date=November 2011}}<!-- since when, still recent? -->, immigration has accounted for more than half of [[Norway]]'s population growth. In 2006, Statistics Norway's (SSB) counted a record 45,800 immigrants arriving in Norway—30% higher than 2005. <ref name="Immigration to Norway increasing"/> At the beginning of 2007, there were 415,300 persons in Norway with an immigrant background (i.e. immigrants, or born of immigrant parents), comprising 8.3 percent of the total population. <ref name="Immigrant population"/> . 

====Portugal====. 
{{Main|Immigration to Portugal}}
[[Portugal]], long a country of emigration, that have created big Portuguese communities in France, USA and Brazil <ref name="Portugal - Emigration"/> has now become a country of net immigration, and not just from the former [[Portuguese empire|colonies]]; by the end of 2003, legal immigrants represented about 4% of the population, and the largest communities were from [[Cape Verde]], [[Brazil]], [[Angola]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[UK]], [[Spain]] and [[Ukraine]]. <ref name="bbc"/> . 

====Spain====. 
{{Main|Immigration to Spain}}
Spain is the most favoured European destination for Britons leaving the UK. <ref name="BBC article: Btits Abroad Country by Country"/>
Since 2000, [[Spain]] has absorbed more than three million immigrants, growing its population by almost 10%. Immigrant population now tops over 4.5 million. According to residence permit data for 2005, about 500,000 were [[Morocco|Moroccan]], another 500,000 were [[Ecuador]]ian,<ref name="Immigration Shift: Many Latin Americans Choosing Spain Over U.S."/> more than 200,000 were [[Romania]]n, and 260,000 were [[Colombia]]n. <ref name="Spain: Immigrants Welcome"/><ref name="www"/> In 2005 alone, a regularisation programme increased the legal immigrant population by 700,000 people. <ref name="Spain grants amnesty to 700,000 migrants"/> . 

====Sweden====. 
{{Main|Immigration to Sweden}}
[[File:Malmö Moske.jpg|thumb|The mosque in [[Malmö]], Sweden.]]
Immigration has been a major source of [[population growth]] and cultural change throughout much of the [[history of Sweden]]. The economic, social, and political aspects of immigration have caused controversy regarding ethnicity, economic benefits, jobs for non-immigrants, settlement patterns, impact on upward [[social mobility]], crime, and voting behavior.  . 

As the [[Government of Sweden|Swedish government]] does not base any statistics on [[ethnicity]], there are no exact numbers on the total number of people of immigrant background in Sweden. As of 2010, 1.33 million people or 14.3% of the inhabitants in Sweden were foreign-born. Sweden has been transformed from a nation of [[emigration]] ending after World War I to a nation of immigration from World War II onwards. In 2009, immigration reached its highest level since records began with 102,280 people emigrating to Sweden. In [[2010]], 32000 people applied for asylum to Sweden, a 25% increase from [[2009]], the highest amount in Swedish history. <ref name="www4"/> In [[2009]], Sweden had the fourth largest number of asylum applications in the [[EU]] and the largest number per capita after [[Cyprus]] and [[Malta]]. <ref name="timesofmalta"/>

[[Image:Ridley road market dalston 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[London]] became multicultural mainly by immigrants. Across London, black and Asian children outnumber white British children by about six to four in state schools. <ref name="One fifth of children from ethnic minorities"/>]]
In 2007, net immigration to the UK was 237,000, a rise of 46,000 on 2006. <ref name="UK net immigration up to 237,000"/> In 2004 the number of people who became [[United Kingdom|British]] citizens rose to a record 140,795—a rise of 12% on the previous year. This number had risen dramatically since 2000. In the 2001 Census, citizens from the [[Republic of Ireland]] were the largest foreign born group and have been for the last 200 years.  This figure does not include those from Northern Ireland located since it is part of the United Kingdom.  Those of Irish ancestry number roughly 6 million from first, second and third generation.  The overwhelming majority of new citizens come from [[Asia]] (40%) and [[Africa]] (32%), the largest three groups being people from [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and [[Somalia]]. <ref name="BBC Thousands in UK citizenship queue"/> . 

In 2005, an estimated 565,000 migrants arrived to live in the UK for at least a year, most of the migrants were people from [[Asia]] (particularly the [[Indian subcontinent]]) and [[Africa]],<ref name="telegraph"/> while 380,000 people emigrated from the UK for a year or more, with [[Australia]], [[Spain]] and [[France]] most popular destinations. <ref name="www7"/> Following [[Poland]]'s entry into the EU in May 2004 it was estimated that by the start of 2007, 375,000 Poles had registered to work in the UK, although the total Polish population in the UK was believed to be 500,000. Many Poles work in seasonal occupations and a large number are likely to move back and forth over time. Many migrants left after the [[Late-2000s recession in Europe#United Kingdom|world economic crisis of 2008]] and  the 30% devaluation of sterling that followed. {{As of|2011|3}} the UK Immigration Minister was [[Damian Green]].  . 

===North America===. 
====Mexico====. 
{{Main|Mexican migration}}
After the United States returned to a more closed border, immigration has been more difficult than ever for Mexican residents hoping to migrate. Mexico is the leading country of migrants to the United States. A [[Mexican Repatriation]] program was founded by the United States to encourage people to voluntarily move to Mexico. However, the program was not found successful and many immigrants were deported against their will. Last year alone, 400,000 Mexican immigrants were repatriated. In 2010 alone, there was a total of 139,120 legal immigrants who migrated to the United States. This put Mexico as the top country for emigration <ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_States</ref> According to recent studies, the amount of immigrants migrating from Mexico should continue to increase tremendously each year. <ref>http://proquest.umi.com/pqdlink?did=290676412&Fmt=2&rqt=309&VName=HNP&cfc=1</ref> .

[[File:Chinatown toronto spadina avenue.JPG|thumb|[[Chinatown, Toronto|Chinatown]] in Downtown [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. In March 2005, Statistics Canada projected that the [[visible minority]] proportion will comprise a majority in both Toronto and Vancouver by 2012.]]
Canada's immigration is driven by [[Economic impact of immigration to Canada|economic policy]] and [[Immigration to Canada#Immigration categories|family reunification]], and is aiming for between 240,000 and 265,000 new permanent residents in 2010. <ref name="Government of Canada Tables 2010 Immigration Plan"/> In 2001, 250,640 people immigrated to Canada. Newcomers settle mostly in the major urban areas of [[Toronto]] and [[Vancouver]]. Since the 1990s, the majority of Canada's immigrants have come from [[Asia]]. <ref name="autogenerated1"/> The leading emigrating countries to Canada are [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Philippines]] and [[India]]. <ref name="Canadians want immigration shakeup"/> Accusing a person of racism in Canada is usually considered a serious slur. <ref name="Modern Racism in Canada by Phil Fontaine"/> All political parties are now cautious about criticizing of the high level of immigration, because, as noted by the [[Globe and Mail]], "in the early 1990s, the old [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]] was branded 'racist' for suggesting that immigration levels be lowered from 250,000 to 150,000."<ref name="Globevolpe"/> .

{{Main|Immigration to the United States}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 137-050127, USA, Deutsche Einwandererfamilie.jpg|thumb|German immigrant family in the United States, 1930]]
Historians estimate that fewer than 1 million immigrants – perhaps as few as 400,000 – crossed the Atlantic during the 17th and 18th centuries. <ref name="Immigration"/> Relatively few 18th-century immigrants came from [[England]]: only 80,000 between 1700 and 1775, compared to 350,000 during the 17th century. <ref name="fpri"/> In addition, between the 17th and 19th centuries, an estimated 645,000 Africans were brought to what is now the United States. <ref name="Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience"/> In the early years of the United States, immigration was fewer than 8,000 people a year. <ref name="americanheritage"/> After 1820, immigration gradually increased. From 1850 to 1930, the foreign born population of the United States increased from 2.2 million to 14.2 million. The highest percentage of foreign born people in the United States was found in this period, with the peak in 1890 at 14.7%. During this time, the lower costs of Atlantic Ocean travel in time and fare made it more advantageous for immigrants to move to the U.S. than in years prior. From 1880 to 1924, over 25 million Europeans migrated to the United States. <ref name = "Immigration"/> Following this time period, immigration fell because in 1924 Congress passed the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], which favored immigrant source countries that already had many immigrants in the U.S. by 1890. <ref name="Immigration Act of 1924"/> Immigration patterns of the 1930s were dominated by the [[Great Depression]], and in the early 1930s, more people emigrated from the United States than immigrated to it. <ref name="cato"/> Immigration continued to fall throughout the 1940s and 1950s, but it increased again afterwards. <ref name="census"/>

The [[Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1965]] (the Hart-Cellar Act) removed quotas on large segments of the immigration flow and legal immigration to the U.S. surged. In 2006, the number of immigrants totaled record 37.5 million. <ref name="washingtonpost"/>  After 2000, [[immigration to the United States]] numbered approximately 1,000,000 per year. Despite tougher border security after 9/11, nearly 8 million immigrants came to the United States from 2000 to 2005 – more than in any other five-year period in the nation's history. <ref name="usatoday"/> Almost half entered illegally. <ref name="washingtontimes"/> In 2006, 1.27 million immigrants were granted [[legal residence]]. [[Mexico]] has been the leading source of new U.S. residents for over two decades; and since 1998,
[[China]], [[India]] and the [[Philippines]] have been in the top four sending countries every year. <ref name="United States: Top Ten Sending Countries, By Country of Birth, 1986 to 2006 (table available by menu selection)"/> The U.S. has often been called the "melting pot" (derived from Carl N. Degler, a historian, author of Out of Our Past), a name derived from United States' rich tradition of immigrants coming to the US looking for something better and having their cultures melded and incorporated into the fabric of the country.  . 

Appointed by President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]], the [[History of laws concerning immigration and naturalization in the United States#1990s|U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform]], led by [[Barbara Jordan]], called for reducing legal immigration to about 550,000 a year. <ref name="google8"/> Since September 11, 2001, the politics of immigration has become an extremely hot issue. It was a central topic of the 2008 election cycle. <ref name="BBC: Q&A: US immigration debate"/> . 

The number of foreign nationals who became legal permanent residents (LPRs) of the U.S. in 2009 as a result of [[family reunification]] (66 percent) outpaced those who became LPRs on the basis of employment skills (13 percent) and humanitarian reasons (17 percent). <ref name="cnsnews"/> Since [[World War II]], more [[refugees]] have found homes in the U.S. than any other nation and more than two million [[Immigration to the United States#Asylum for refugees|refugees]] have arrived in the U.S. since 1980. Of the top ten countries accepting resettled refugees in 2006, the United States accepted more than twice as much as the next nine countries combined. <ref name="Refugee Resettlement in Metropolitan America"/> One [[econometrics]] report in 2010 by analyst Kusum Mundra suggested that immigration positively affected bilateral trade when the U.S. had a networked community of immigrants, but that the trade benefit was weakened when the immigrants became assimilated into American culture. <ref name="twsA36"/> .

The table above does not include the years 2011 and 2012. According to [[Permanent residence (United States)]], in 2011 there were 2.7 million entries entered in the Diversity Visa Lottery. So far in 2012, there has been 19.6 million participants.{{when|date=April 2012}} The numbers increase tremendously each year. There is now a waiting period held by the U.S. government to decide who will be eligible for entry as a permanent resident of the United States.  . 

===Oceania===. 
====Australia====. 
{{Main|Immigration to Australia}}
The overall level of immigration to [[Australia]] has grown substantially during the last decade. Net overseas migration increased from 30,000 in 1993<ref name="abs"/> to 118,000 in 2003-04. <ref name="abs2"/> The largest components of immigration are the skilled migration and family re-union programs. The [[mandatory detention in Australia|mandatory detention]] of [[unauthorised arrival]]s [[boat people|by boat]] has generated great levels of controversy. During the 2004-05, total 123,424 people immigrated to Australia. Of them, 17,736 were from [[Africa]], 54,804 from [[Asia]], 21,131 from [[Oceania]], 18,220 from [[United Kingdom]], 1,506 from [[South America]], and 2,369 from the rest of [[Europe]]. <ref name=autogenerated1 /> 131,000 people migrated to Australia in 2005-06<ref name="immi"/> and migration target for 2006-07 was 144,000. <ref name="Australian Immigration Fact Sheet 20. Migration Program Planning Levels"/> . 

====New Zealand====. 
{{Main|Immigration to New Zealand}}
[[New Zealand]] has relatively open [[Immigration to New Zealand|immigration policies]]. 23% of the population was born overseas, mainly in [[Asia]], [[Oceania]], and [[UK]], one of the highest rates in the world. In 2010-2014, an annual target of 45,000±5000 immigrants was set by the Immigration New Zealand.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} . 

==Economic effects==. 
The Cato Institute finds little or no effect of immigration on income of native born. <ref name="Immigration: The Demographic and Economic Facts"/>  The Brookings Institution finds a 2.3% depression of wages from immigration from 1980 to 2007. <ref name="Impact of Immigration on the Distribution of American Well-Being"/> The Center for Immigration Studies finds a 3.7% depression wages from immigration from 1980 to 2000. <ref name="Increasing the Supply of Labor Through Immigration"/> . 

According to the ''European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia'', "In Europe, 28 percent of foreigners between the ages of 25 and 49 are unable to find work, with unemployment rates as high as 35 percent for Turks and Pakistanis and 60 percent for recent immigrant groups such as Somalis."<ref name="google9"/> . 

Toronto’s unemployment rate was 6.7% in November 2010, including 19.7% among recent immigrants. <ref>"[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/jobless-rate-up-for-toronto-immigrants/article1825182/ Jobless rate up for Toronto immigrants]". ''[[The Globe and Mail]].'' December 3, 2010. </ref> . 

==Welfare==. 
Research has found that that as immigration and ethnic heterogeneity increase, government funding of [[welfare]] and public support for welfare decrease. [[Ethnic nepotism]] may be an explanation for this phenomenon. Other possible explanations include theories regarding [[in-group]] and out-group effects as well as [[reciprocal altruism]]. <ref name="autogenerated"/> .
