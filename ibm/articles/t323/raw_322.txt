{{legal status}}
A '''refugee''' is a person who is outside their country of origin or habitual residence because they have suffered persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or because they are a member of a persecuted 'social group'. Such a person may be referred to as an 'asylum seeker' until recognized by the state where she makes her claim. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/161121|title=refugee, n.|work=[[Oxford English Dictionary Online]]|date=November 2010|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> Under the [[United Nations]] [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] of 1951, a refugee is more narrowly defined (in Article 1A) as a person who "owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org.au/basicdef.shtml|title=Definitions and obligations|publisher=UNHCR|accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref> The concept of a refugee was expanded by the Convention's 1967 Protocol and by regional conventions in [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]] to include persons who had fled [[war]] or other [[violence]] in their home country. [[Refugee women and children]] represent an additional subsection of refugees that need special attention.  For the refugee system to work successfully, countries must be prepared to allow [[Open borders]] for people fleeing conflict, particularly for countries closest to the conflict. This is a program that has help many people, but people still believe there are flaws. Getting to a refugee camp is extremely difficult.  . 

The term refugee is often used to include [[displaced persons]] who may fall outside the legal definition in the Convention,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.ca/Refugee/who.php|title=Refugees in Canada|publisher=Amnesty International Canada|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> either because they have left their home countries because of war and not because of a fear of persecution, or because they have been forced to migrate within their home countries. The [[Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa]], adopted by the [[Organization of African Unity]] in 1969, employs a definition expanded from the Convention's, including people who left their countries of origin not only because of persecution but also due to acts of external aggression, occupation, domination by foreign powers or serious disturbances of public order. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrea.org/index.php?doc_id=418|title=Refugees and Displaced Persons|publisher=Human Rights Education Associates|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> . 

Refugees were defined as a legal group in response to the large numbers of people fleeing [[Eastern Europe]] following [[World War II]]. The lead international agency coordinating refugee protection is the Office of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR), which counted 8,400,000 refugees worldwide at the beginning of 2006. This was the lowest number since 1980. <ref name=numbers>[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home/opendoc.htm?tbl=BASICS&id=3b028097c&page=basics#Refugees Refugees by Numbers 2006 edition], UNHCR</ref> The major exception is the 4,600,000 [[Palestinian refugee]]s under the authority of the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East]] (UNRWA), who are the only group to be granted refugee status to the descendants of refugees according to the above definition. <ref name="UNWRA">{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/unrwa/refugees/whois.html|title=Who is a Palestine refugee?|publisher=United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East|accessdate=2009-09-21}}</ref> The U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants gives the world total as 62,000,000 refugees and estimates there are over 34,000,000 displaced by war, including [[internally displaced person]]s, who remain within the same national borders. The majority of refugees who leave their country seek asylum in countries neighboring their country of nationality. The "durable solutions" to refugee populations, as defined by UNHCR and governments, are: voluntary repatriation to the country of origin; local integration into the country of asylum; and resettlement to a third country. <ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/partners/PARTNERS/3f1408764.pdf Framework for Durable Solutions for Refugees and Other Persons of Concern], UNHCR Core Group on Durable Solutions, May 2003, p. 5</ref> . 

As of December 31, 2005, the largest source countries of refugees are [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Myanmar]], [[Somalia]], [[South Sudan]], and the [[Palestinian Territory|Palestinian Territories]]. <ref>{{cite web

==History==. 
{{See also|right of asylum|sanctuary}}
The notion that a person who sought sanctuary in a holy place could not be harmed without inviting divine retribution was familiar to the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and [[ancient Egypt]]ians. However,the [[right of asylum|right to seek asylum]] in a church or other holy place was first codified in law by King [[Ethelbert of Kent]] in about 600 A.D. Similar laws were implemented throughout [[Europe]] in the [[Middle Ages]]. The related concept of political [[exile]] also has a long history: [[Ovid]] was sent to [[Tomis]]; [[Voltaire]] was sent to England. Through the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]], nations recognized each others' [[sovereignty]]. However, it was not until the advent of [[romantic nationalism]] in late 18th century Europe that [[nationalism]] gained sufficient prevalence for the phrase 'country of nationality' to become practically meaningful, and for people crossing borders to be required to provide identification. 
[[Image:ArmeniansOnDeportationMarch.jpg|thumb|150px|One million [[Armenians]] fled Turkey between 1915 and 1923 to escape persecution and genocide.]]
The term 'refugee' is sometimes applied to people who may have fit the definition outlined by the 1951 Convention, were it to be applied retroactively. There are many candidates. For example, after the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] in 1685 outlawed [[Protestantism]] in France, hundreds of thousands of [[Huguenot]]s fled to England, the [[Netherlands]], [[Switzerland]], [[South Africa]], Germany and [[Prussia]]. The repeated waves of [[pogrom]]s that swept Eastern Europe in the 19th and early 20th century prompted mass Jewish emigration (more than 2 million [[History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union|Russian Jews]] emigrated in the period 1881–1920). From the 19th century, a large portion of the Muslim peoples (termed '[[Muhajir (Turkey)|Muhacir]]' under a general definition) of the [[Balkans]], [[Caucasus]], [[Crimea]] and [[Crete]]<ref>By the early 19th century, as many as 45% of the islanders may have been Muslim. </ref> took refuge in present-day [[Turkey]] and shaped that country's fundamental features. <ref>Justin McCarthy, ''Death and Exile: The Ethnic Cleansing of Ottoman Muslims, 1821-1922'', (Princeton, N.J: Darwin Press, c1995</ref> The [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912–1913 caused 800,000 people to leave their homes. <ref>[http://tulp.leidenuniv.nl/content_docs/wap/ejz18.pdf Greek and Turkish refugees and deportees 1912-1924]. Universiteit Leiden. </ref> Various groups of people were officially designated refugees beginning in [[World War I]].  . 

===League of Nations===. 
The first international co-ordination on refugee affairs came with the [[League of Nations]]' appointment of [[Fridtjof Nansen]] to the newly-created post of High Commissioner for Refugees. This position, and the attendant Commission, was set up in 1921 to assist the approximately 1,500,000 people who fled the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the subsequent [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] (1917–1921),<ref>"''[http://books.google.com/books?id=uUsLAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA1&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Transactions of the American Philosophical Society]''". American Philosophical Society, James E. Hassell (1991). p.1. ISBN 0-87169-817-X</ref> most of them aristocrats fleeing the Communist government. In 1923, the mandate of the Commission was expanded to include the more than one million [[Armenian people|Armenian]]s who left [[Turkey (country)|Turkish]] [[Asia Minor]] in 1915 and 1923 due to a series of events now known as the [[Armenian Genocide]]. Over the next several years, the mandate was expanded to include [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]]s and Turkish refugees. <ref name=nobel>{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1938/nansen-history.html
|title=Nansen International Office for Refugee: The Nobel Peace Prize 1938 |publisher=The Nobel Foundation}}</ref> In all of these cases, a refugee was defined as a person in a group for which the League of Nations had approved a mandate, as opposed to a person to whom a general definition applied.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} . 

The 1923 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] involved some two million people, most forcibly made refugees and ''de jure'' denaturalized from homelands of centuries or millennia, in a treaty promoted and overseen by the international community as part of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]].  . 

The U.S. Congress passed the [[Emergency Quota Act]] in 1921, followed by the [[Immigration Act of 1924]]. The Immigration Act of 1924 was aimed at further restricting the Southern and Eastern Europeans, especially Jews, Italians and Slavs, who had begun to enter the country in large numbers beginning in the 1890s. <ref>[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003265600_impghistory20.html Old fears over new faces], The Seattle Times, September 21, 2006</ref> Most of the European refugees (principally [[Jews]] and [[Slavs]]) fleeing Stalin, the Nazis and World War II were barred from coming to the United States. <ref>[http://www.usconstitution.com/immigrationactof1924.htm U S Constitution - The Immigration Act of 1924]</ref>
[[Image:Spanish War Children001.jpg|thumb|Children preparing for evacuation from Spain during the [[Spanish Civil War]] between 1936 and 1939.]]
In 1930, the [[Nansen International Office for Refugees]] was established as a successor agency to the Commission. Its most notable achievement was the [[Nansen passport]], a [[passport]] for refugees, for which it was awarded the 1938 [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. The Nansen Office was plagued by problems of financing, an increase in refugee numbers, and a lack of co-operation from some member states, which led to mixed success overall. However, it managed to lead fourteen nations to ratify the Refugee Convention of 1933, an early, and relatively modest, attempt at a [[human rights]] charter, and in general assisted around one million refugees worldwide. <ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1938/nansen-history.html The Nobel Peace Prize 1938: Nansen International Office for Refugees], Nobelprize.org</ref> . 

The rise of [[Nazism]] led to such a severe increase in the number of refugees from Germany that in 1933 the League created a High Commission for Refugees Coming from Germany. On July 4, 1936 an agreement was signed under League auspices that defined a refugee coming from Germany as "any person who was settled in that country, who does not possess any nationality other than German nationality, and in respect of whom it is established that in law or in fact he or she does not enjoy the protection of the Government of the Reich" (article 1). <ref>Text in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 171, pp. 76-87. </ref> The mandate of this High Commission was subsequently expanded to include persons from [[Austria]] and [[Sudetenland]]. 150,000 [[Czechs]] were displaced after October 1, 1938, when the German army entered the border regions of [[Czechoslovakia]] surrendered in accordance with the [[Munich Agreement]]. <ref>[http://www.radio.cz/en/article/46238 Forced displacement of Czech population under Nazis in 1938 and 1943], Radio Prague</ref> . 

On 31 December 1938, both the Nansen Office and High Commission were dissolved and replaced by the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees under the Protection of the League. <ref name=nobel/> This coincided with the flight of several hundred thousand Spanish Republicans to France after their loss to the Nationalists in 1939 in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/2809025.stm Spanish Civil War fighters look back]</ref> . 

===World War II and UNHCR===. 
The conflict and political instability during [[World War II]] led to massive amounts of enforced [[human migration|migration]] (see [[World War II evacuation and expulsion]]). By the end of World War II, [[Europe]] had more than 40 million refugees. <ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,920455-2,00.html |title= Refugees: Save Us! Save Us! |publisher=Time |date=9 July 1979}}</ref>  In 1943, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] created the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] (UNRRA) to provide aid to areas liberated from [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]], including parts of Europe and [[China]]. This included returning over seven million refugees, then commonly referred to as [[displaced person]]s or DPs, to their country of origin and setting up [[displaced persons camp]]s for one million refugees who refused to be repatriated.

In the last months of [[World War II]] some five million German civilians from the German provinces of East Prussia, Pomerania and Silesia fled the onslaught of the Red Army and became refugees in Mecklenburg, Brandenburg and Saxony. After the capitulation of the Wehrmacht in May 1945 the Allies occupied Germany in the borders as they were on 31 December 1937, as agreed to in the Berlin declaration of 5 June 1945. Since the spring of 1945 the Poles had been forcefully expelling the remaining German population in these provinces in a program of [[ethnic cleansing]]. When the Allies met in Potsdam on 17 July 1945 at the [[Potsdam Conference]], a chaotic refugee situation faced the occupying powers. On 2 August 1945, they established the Potsdam protocol. Article IX placed one fourth of Germany's territory under provisional Polish administration and Article XIII ordered that the remaining German populations in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary be transferred West in an "orderly and humane" manner.  . 

Although not approved by Allies at Potsdam, hundreds of thousands of [[ethnic German]] living in Yugoslavia and Romania were deported to slave labour in the Soviet Union, to [[Allied Control Council|Allied-occupied Germany]], and subsequently to the German Democratic Republic, Austria and the Federal Republic of Germany. This entailed the largest [[population transfer]] in history. In all 15 million Germans were affected, and more than two million perished during the [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expulsion of the German population]]. <ref>{{cite book| title=Statistisches Bundesamt, Die Deutschen Vertreibungsverluste |location=Wiesbaden |year= 1958}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Forced Resettlement", "Population, Expulsion and Transfer", "Repatriation" |work= Encyclopaedia of Public International Law |publisher=North Holland Publishers |edition=Volumes 1–5 |location=Amsterdam |date= 1993–2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| author=Norman Naimark |title= The Russians in Germany |publisher= Harvard University Press |year=  1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| author=Alfred de Zayas |title=Nemesis at Potsdam |publisher=Routledge |location= London and Boston |year= 1977}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| author=Alfred de Zayas |title=A Terrible Revenge |publisher=Palgrave/Macmillan |year= 2006}}</ref> (See [[German exodus from Eastern Europe]].) Between the end of World War II and the erection of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961, more than 563,700 refugees from [[East Germany]] traveled to [[West Germany]] for asylum from the [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet occupation]].  . 

During the same period, millions of former Russian citizens were [[Operation Keelhaul|forcefully repatriated]] against their will into the USSR. <ref>{{cite journal| title=The United States and Forced Repatriation of Soviet Citizens, 1944-47 |author=Mark Elliott |work=Political Science Quarterly | volume= 88 | issue= 2 |date = June 1973|pages=253–275}}</ref> On 11 February 1945, at the conclusion of the [[Yalta Conference]], the United States and [[United Kingdom]] signed a Repatriation Agreement with the USSR. <ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.fff.org/freedom/0895a.asp |title=Repatriation -- The Dark Side of World War II}}</ref> The interpretation of this Agreement resulted in the forcible repatriation of all Soviets regardless of their wishes.

[[Poland]] and [[Soviet Ukraine]] conducted population exchanges – [[Poles]] who resided east of the newly established Poland-Soviet border were deported to Poland (ca. 2,100,000 persons) (see [[Repatriation of Poles (1944–1946)|Repatriation of Poles]]) and [[Ukrainians]] residing west of the new border were deported to Soviet Ukraine. [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|Population transfer]] to Soviet Ukraine occurred from September 1944 to May 1946 (ca. 450,000 persons) (see [[repatriation of Ukrainians from Poland to the Soviet Union|Repatriation of Ukrainians]]).

===UNHCR===. 
{{Main|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees}}
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2010}}
Headquartered in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], the Office of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) (established December 14, 1950) protects and supports refugees at the request of a government or the [[United Nations]] and assists in their return or resettlement. All refugees in the world are under the UNHCR mandate except [[Palestinian refugees|Palestinian Arabs]], who fled the future [[Israel|Jewish state]] between 1947 and 1949 (see below), and their descendants. However, Palestinian Arabs, who fled the West Bank and Gaza after 1949 (for example, during the 1967 [[Six Day war]]) are under the jurisdiction of the UNHCR.  . 

UNHCR provides protection and assistance not only to refugees, but also to other categories of displaced or needy people. These include asylum seekers, refugees who have returned home but still need help in rebuilding their lives, local civilian communities directly affected by the movements of refugees, stateless people and so-called internally displaced people (IDPs). IDPs are civilians who have been forced to flee their homes, but who have not reached a neighboring country and therefore, unlike refugees, are not protected by international law and may find it hard to receive any form of assistance. As the nature of war has changed in the last few decades, with more and more internal conflicts replacing interstate wars, the number of IDPs has increased significantly to an estimated 5 million people worldwide.  . 

It succeeded the earlier [[International Refugee Organization]] and the even earlier [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] (which itself succeeded the [[League of Nations]]' Commissions for Refugees).  . 

UNHCR was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1954 and 1981. The agency is mandated to lead and co-ordinate international action to protect refugees and resolve refugee problems worldwide. Its primary purpose is to safeguard the rights and well-being of refugees. It strives to ensure that everyone can exercise the right to seek asylum and find safe refuge in another State, with the option to return home voluntarily, integrate locally or to resettle in a third country.  . 

Many celebrities are associated with the agency as [[UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador]]s, currently including [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Giorgio Armani]] and others. The individual who has raised the most money in benefit performances and volunteer work on behalf of UNHCR was [[Luciano Pavarotti]]. <ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE5D8133CF933A05756C0A9679C8B63&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fI%2fImmigration%20and%20Refugees Query.NYtimes.com]</ref> . 

UNHCR's mandate has gradually been expanded to include protecting and providing humanitarian assistance to what it describes as other persons "of concern," including internally-displaced persons (IDPs) who would fit the legal definition of a refugee under the 1951 Refugee Convention and 1967 Protocol, the 1969 Organization for African Unity Convention, or some other treaty if they left their country, but who presently remain in their country of origin. UNHCR thus has missions in [[Colombia]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Serbia and Montenegro]] and [[Côte d'Ivoire]] to assist and provide services to IDPs. 
Asia – 8,603,600
Africa – 5,169,300
Europe – 3,666,700
Latin America and Caribbean – 2,513,000
North America – 716,800
Oceania – 82,500.  . 

==International attitude==. 
===Law===. 
{{Main|Refugee law}}
Under [[international law]], refugees are individuals who:
*are outside their [[country]] of [[nationality]] or habitual residence;
*have a well-founded fear of persecution because of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion; and
*are unable or unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country, or to return there, for fear of persecution.  . 

[[Refugee law]] encompasses both customary law, [[peremptory norm]]s, and international legal instruments. These include: . 

*The 1951 [[United Nations]] [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]]; also referred to as the Geneva Convention;
*The 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees;
* The 1969 OAU Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa<ref>[http://www.africa-union.org/Official_documents/Treaties_%20Conventions_%20Protocols/Refugee_Convention.pdf The 1969 OAU Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa]</ref> . 

===World Refugee Day===. 
{{main|World Refugee Day}}
World Refugee Day occurs on June 20. The day was created in 2000 by a special United Nations General Assembly Resolution. June 20 had previously been commemorated as African Refugee Day in a number of African countries.  . 

In the [[United Kingdom]] World Refugee Day is celebrated as part of Refugee Week. Refugee Week is a nationwide festival designed to promote understanding and to celebrate the cultural contributions of refugees, and features many events such as music, dance and theatre.  . 

In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the World Day of Migrants and Refugees is celebrated in January each year, having been instituted in 1914 by Pope [[Pius X]].  . 

"Nothing At All" is a folk song by Bob Thomas and Huw Pudner about the plight of a refugee being forced back to his own country against his will.  .

International [[refugee law]] defines a refugee as someone who seeks refuge in a foreign country because of war and violence, or out of fear of persecution.  The United States recognizes persecution "on account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group" as grounds for seeking asylum. <ref>[[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|INA]] §208; 8 [[U.S.C.]] §1158</ref> Until a request for refuge has been accepted, the person is referred to as an ''asylum seeker''. Only after the recognition of the asylum seeker's protection needs, he or she is officially referred to as a refugee and enjoys refugee status, which carries certain rights and obligations according to the legislation of the receiving country.  . 

The practical determination of whether a person is a refugee or not is most often left to certain government agencies within the host country. This can lead to a situation where the country will neither recognize the refugee status of the asylum seekers nor see them as legitimate migrants and treat them as [[Alien (law)|illegal aliens]].  . 

The percentage of asylum/refugee seekers who (it has been deemed) do not meet the international standards of special-needs refugee, and for whom resettlement is deemed proper, varies from country to country. Failed asylum applicants are most often deported, sometimes after imprisonment or detention, as in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, over one in four decisions to refuse an asylum seeker protection UK is [http://lassn.pir2.info/asylum_facts.htm LASSN] Campaigners have suggested that this figure suggests the process of allocation refugee status is inefficient or flawed.  . 

A claim for asylum may also be made onshore, usually after making an [[unauthorized arrival]]. Some [[government]]s are tolerant and accepting of onshore asylum claims; other governments [[arrest]] or [[detain]] those who attempt to seek asylum; sometimes while processing their claims.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}} . 

Non-governmental organizations concerned with refugees and asylum seekers have pointed out difficulties for [[displaced person]]s to seek asylum in industrialized countries. As their [[immigration policy]] often focuses on the fight of [[irregular migration]] and the strengthening of border controls it deters [[displaced person]]s from entering territory in which they could lodge an asylum claim. The lack of opportunities to legally access the asylum procedures can force asylum seekers to undertake often expensive and hazardous attempts at illegal entry.  . 

Concerns over arbitrariness in asylum adjudication in the United States have led some commentators to describe the process as [[refugee roulette]]; that is, a system in which the identity of the adjudicator, rather than the strength of the asylum seeker's claim, is the determining factor in winning an asylum claim.  .

===Economic migrants===. 
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2009}}
Not all migrants seeking shelter in another country fall under the definition of "refugee" according to article 1A of the Geneva Convention. In 1951, when the text of the Convention was discussed, the parties of the treaty had the idea that [[slavery]] was a thing from the past: therefore escaped and fleeing slaves are a group not mentioned in the definition, as well as a category that later emerged: the [[climate refugee]] (:[[Environmental migrant]]") (see below).  . 

In 2008-2009, the humanitarian nature of the mass movement of [[Zimbabwe]]ans to neighbouring [[Southern African]] blurred the distinction between what is a "refugee" and an "economic migrant". Such people fit neither category perfectly and have more general needs, rights and responsibilities, that fall outside the specific mandate of the UNHCR. They fall between the cracks, according to the report ''Zimbabwean Migration into Southern Africa: New Trends and Responses'', released in November 2009 by the [[Forced Migration Studies Programme]] (FMSP) at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]], [[Republic of South Africa|South Africa]]. <ref>[http://www.migration.org.za/report/zimbabwean-migration-southern-africa-new-trends-and-responses "Zimbabwean Migration into Southern Africa: New Trends and Responses"]</ref><ref>[http://www.polity.org.za/article/zimbabwean-migration-into-southern-africa-new-trends-and-responses-november-2009-2009-12-03 "Zimbabwean Migration into Southern Africa: New Trends and Responses"]</ref> According to the researchers, a lack of protection of migrants in the region was based on a ''"false distinction"'' between a forced and an economic migrant, instead of focusing on the real and urgent needs some of these migrants have. The report suggested that a better term would be "forced humanitarian migrants", who moved for the purpose of their and their dependents' basic survival.  . 

To emphasize the importance of a common humanitarian position on the outflow of Zimbabweans into the region the [[Regional Office for Southern Africa]] of the [[UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] coined the term "migrants of humanitarian concern" in 2008.  . 

Official responses to Zimbabwean migration in [[Botswana]], [[Malawi]], [[Zambia]] and [[Mozambique]] are still premised on the original definition from the 1951 Convention, and so were said to be failing to protect both Zimbabweans and their own citizens". Those crossing the border were neither refugees - most did not even apply for refugee status - and, given the extent of economic collapse at home, nor they could hardly be considered as "voluntary" economic migrants. So many of them were not legally protected, nor do they receive humanitarian support, as they fell outside the mandates of the support structures offered by government and non-government institutions. In Botswana, Zambia and Malawi, asylum is available to Zimbabweans; in Mozambique, the few applicants for asylum had been rejected due to the state's decision to consider Zimbabweans as 'economic' and not forced humanitarian migrants.  . 

Except for South Africa, protection and access to services in most countries in the region is contingent on receiving the refugee status, and require asylum seekers to stay in isolated camps, unable to work or travel, and thus send money to relatives that stayed behind in Zimbabwe. South Africa was considering the introduction of a special permit for Zimbabweans, but the policy was still under review.  . 

===Boat people===. 
{{Main|Boat people}}
The term "boat people" came into common use in the 1970s with the mass exodus of Vietnamese refugees following the [[Vietnam War]]. It is a widely used form of migration for people migrating from [[Cuba]], [[Haiti]], [[Morocco]], [[Vietnam]] or [[Albania]]. They often risk their lives on dangerously crude and overcrowded boats to escape oppression or [[poverty]] in their home nations. Events resulting from the [[Vietnam War]] led many people in [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], and especially [[Vietnam]] to become refugees in the late 1970s and 1980s. In 2001, 353 asylum seekers sailing from [[Indonesia]] to [[Australia]] drowned when their [[SIEV X|vessel sank]].  . 

The main danger to a boat person is that the boat he or she is sailing in may actually be anything that floats and is large enough for passengers. Although such makeshift craft can result in tragedy, in 2003 a small group of 5 [[Cubans|Cuban]] refugees attempted (unsuccessfully, but un-harmed) to reach [[Florida]] in a 1950s pickup truck made buoyant by oil barrels strapped to its sides.  . 

Boat people are frequently a source of controversy in the nation they seek to immigrate to, such as the United States, [[New Zealand]], Germany, France, [[Russia]], [[Canada]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], Spain and [[Australia]]. Boat people are often forcibly prevented from landing at their destination, such as under Australia's [[Pacific Solution]] (which operated from 2001 until 2008), or they are subjected to [[mandatory detention]] after their arrival.  . 

==Refugee absorption solutions==. 
===Camps===. 
[[Image:Refugee camp in Guinea.jpg|thumb|A camp in [[Guinea]] for refugees from [[Sierra Leone]] ]]
{{Main|Refugee camp}}
A refugee camp is a place built by [[government]]s or [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s (such as the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]]) to receive refugees. People may stay in these camps, receiving emergency food and medical aid, until it is safe to return to their homes or until they are retrieved by other people outside the camps. In some cases, often after several years, other countries decide it will never be safe to return these people, and they are resettled in "third countries", away from the border they crossed.  However, more often than not, refugees are not resettled.  In the meantime, they are at risk for disease, child soldier recruitment, terrorist recruitment, and physical and sexual violence. There are estimated to be 700 refugee camp locations. <ref>http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home</ref> .

Resettlement involves the assisted movement of refugees who are unable to return home to safe third countries. <ref name="What is resettlement">{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/pages/4a1d0a9e6.html|title=What is resettlement? A new challenge|publisher=UNHCR|accessdate=2009-07-19}}</ref><ref name=Resettlement>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/pages/4a16b1676.html|title=Resettlement: A new beginning in a third country|publisher=UNHCR|accessdate=2009-07-19}}</ref> The UNHCR has traditionally seen resettlement as the least preferable of the "durable solutions" to refugee situations. <ref name="RIAF Guide">{{cite web|url=http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/OneStopCMS/Core/CrawlerResourceServer.aspx?resource=3140698F-6646-468B-AD6E-217439B9ACB5&mode=link&guid=eca93211dd1d4c9585770f026739c401|title=Understanding Resettlement to the UK: A Guide to the Gateway Protection Programme|date=June 2004|publisher=Refugee Council on behalf of the Resettlement Inter-Agency Partnership|accessdate=2009-07-19}}</ref> However, in April 2000 the then UN High Commissioner for Refugees, [[Sadako Ogata]], stated: . 

{{cquote|Resettlement can no longer be seen as the least-preferred durable solution; in many cases it is the ''only'' solution for refugees|200px||Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees,April 2000<ref name="RIAF Guide"/>}} . 

Resettlement involves a number of difficulties, most of them involving the often extreme cultural transition needed to adapt to life in the country of resettlement.  For the many refugees going from rural [[undeveloped countries]] to life in urban centers, public transport, education, health care systems, job applications, and even grocery shopping can be difficult to navigate.  Language barriers also frequently pose a problem.  Even aside from material problems, resettled refugees can struggle with issues of identity and belonging, as societal integration can be very difficult in a completely different culture, and discrimination frequently further inhibits the process. <ref name="UNHCR Resettlement Handbook">UNHCR, ''Refugee Resettlement. An International Handbook to Guide Reception and Integration'', http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/405189284.pdf, 22-23. </ref> . 

The UNHCR does recognize benefits to resettlement as well, however.  On their website, they bring attention to the fact that refugees have much to bring to the countries in which they are resettled in terms of culture and labor, going as far as to say that “both refugee resettlement and general migration are now recognized as critical factors in the economic success of a number of industrialized countries.”<ref name="UNHCR Resettlement Handbook" />   According to the UNHCR, resettlement serves three primary functions: securing fundamental [[human rights]] such as “life, liberty, safety, health,” etc.for refugees who are at risk in camps, providing a long-term solution to the issue of [[displacement]] for large numbers of refugees, and alleviating the burden on countries offering asylum to such displaced peoples. <ref>UNHCR, “Introducing Resettlement,” http://www.unhcr.org/3d4653c84.pdf, 3. </ref>   Frequently, these countries of asylum are some of the world’s poorest nations and cannot handle the large influx of persons that occur when war, persecution, or other events drive refugees across their borders into their country. <ref name="UNHCR Resettlement Handbook" />  . 

However, only about 1% of the over 10.5 million refugees the UNHCR typically deals with are submitted for resettlement. Around 108,000 refugees were considered for the opportunity to be resettled in 2010, with the primary countries of origin being Iraq, Myanmar, and Bhutan. <ref>The UN Refugee Agency, “Resettlement,” http://www.unhcr.org/pages/4a16b1676.html. </ref> . 

UNHCR referred more than 121,000 refugees for consideration for resettlement in 2008. This was the highest number for 15 years. In 2007, 98,999 people were referred. UNHCR referred 33,512 refugees from [[Iraq]], 30,388 from [[Burma|Burma/Myanmar]] and 23,516 from [[Bhutan]] in 2008. <ref name=Resettlement/>
[[File:Refugees mother and baby.jpg|thumb|180px|Refugees during the wars in former Yugoslavia]]
In terms of resettlement ''departures'', in 2008, 65,548 refugees were resettled in 26 countries, up from 49,868 in 2007. <ref name=Resettlement/> The largest number of UNHCR-assisted departures were from [[Thailand]] (16,807), [[Nepal]] (8,165), [[Syria]] (7,153), [[Jordan]] (6,704) and [[Malaysia]] (5,865). <ref name=Resettlement/> Note that these are the countries that refugees were resettled from, not their countries of origin.  . 

A number of third countries run specific resettlement programmes in co-operation with UNHCR. The size of these programmes is shown in the table. <ref name="RIAF Guide"/> The largest programmes are run by thigate poverty and is already hap[[Australia]]. A number of [[Europe]]an countries run smaller schemes and in 2004 the [[United Kingdom]] established its own scheme, known as the [[Gateway Protection Programme]]<ref name="RIAF Guide"/> with an initial annual quota of 500, which rose to 750 in the financial year 2008/09. <ref name="Gateway">{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=Olga|coauthors=Murray, Rosemary|date=February 2009|title=The Gateway Protection Programme: An evaluation|journal=Home Office Research Report|volume=12|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs09/horr12c.pdf}}</ref> . 

In September 2009, the [[European Commission]] unveiled plans for new Joint EU Resettlement Programme. The scheme would involve EU member states deciding together each year which refugees should be given priority. Member states would receive €4,000 from the [[European Refugee Fund]] per refugee resettled. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8233187.stm|title=EU plans to admit more refugees|date=2009-09-02|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-09-02}}</ref> . 

Between 1981, when [[Japan]] ratified the U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, and 2002, Japan recognized only 305 persons as refugees. <ref>"[http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/(Symbol)/E.CN.4.Sub.2.2003.NGO.45.En?Opendocument Written statement submitted by Japan Fellowship of Reconciliation]". Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. </ref> According to the UNHCR, in 2006 Japan accepted 26 refugees for resettlement. <ref>"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ed20081012a2.html Refugees in Japan]". The Japan Times Online. October 12, 2008</ref> . 

The United States helped resettle roughly 2 million refugees between 1945 and 1979, when their refugee [[resettlement]] program was restructured.  They now make use of 11 “Voluntary Agencies" ([[VOLAG|VOLAGS]]), which are [[non-governmental organizations]] that assist the government in the resettlement process. <ref name="Taft, North, and Ford">Julia Vadala Taft, David S. North, David A. Ford, “Refugee Resettlement in the U.S.: Time For a New Focus”, (Washington: New TransCentury Foundation, 1979). </ref>  These organizations assist the refugees with the day-to-day needs of the large transition into a completely new culture.  Usually, they are not funded by the government, but instead rely on their own resources and volunteers.  Most of them have local offices, and [[caseworker]]s that provide individualized aid to each refugee’s situation.  They do rely on the sponsorship of individuals or groups, such as faith-based congregations or local organizations.  The largest of the VOLAGS is the Migration and Refugee Services of the U.S. Catholic Conference. <ref name="Taft, North, and Ford" />   Others include [[Church World Service]], Episcopal Migration Ministries, the Ethiopian Community Development Council, the [[Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society]], the [[International Rescue Committee]], Lutheran Immigration Services, the [[U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants]], and [[World Relief]]. <ref>“2007 Report to Congress,” Office of Refugee Resettlement, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, Administration for Children and Families Office of Refugee Resettlement, pages C-1 – C-10. </ref>  . 

There are a number of advantages to the strategy of using agencies other than the government to directly assist in resettlement.  First of all, it has been estimated that for a federal or state bureaucracy to resettle refugees instead of the VOLAGS would double the overall cost.  These agencies are often able to procure large quantities of donations and, more importantly, volunteers.  According to one study, when the fact that resettlement workers often have to work nights, weekends, and overtime in order to meet the demands of the large cultural transition of new refugees is taken into account, the use of volunteers reduces the overall cost down to roughly a quarter. <ref>Robert G. Wright, “Voluntary Agencies and the Resettlement of Refugees,” from International Migration Review Vol. 15, No. ½, Refugees Today (Spring – Summer, 1981), (New York: The Center for Migraiton Studies of New York), 172. </ref>   VOLAGS are also more flexible and responsive than the government since they are smaller and rely on their own funds.  . 

===Right of return===. 
Even in a supposedly "post-conflict" environment, it is not a simple process for refugees to return home. <ref name=ODI>Sara Pantuliano (2009) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4409&title=uncharted-territory-land-conflict-humanitarian-action Uncharted Territory: Land, Conflict and Humanitarian Action] [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> The UN Pinheiro Principles are guided by the idea that not only people have the right to return home, but also to the same property. <ref name=ODI/> It seeks to return to the pre-conflict status quo and ensure that no one profits from the violence. Yet this is a very complex issue and every situation is different, conflict is a highly transformative force and the pre-war status-quo can never be reestablished completely, even if that were desirable (it may have caused the conflict in the first place). <ref name=ODI/> Therefore, the following are of particular importance to the right to return:<ref name=ODI/>
* may never have had property (e.g. in Afghanistan);
* cannot access what property they have (Colombia, Guatemala, South Africa and Sudan);
* ownership is unclear as families have expanded or split and division of the land becomes an issue;
* death of owner may leave dependents without clear claim to the land;
* people settled on the land know it is not theirs but have nowhere else to go (as in Colombia, Rwanda and Timor-Leste); and
* have competing claims with others, including the state and its foreign or local business partners (as in Aceh, Angola, Colombia, Liberia and Sudan).  . 

==Historical and contemporary crises==. 
===Movements in Africa===. 
[[File:Somali bantu children florida.jpg|thumb|Refugee children from Somalia's [[Somali Bantu|Bantu]] minority ethnic group pictured in [[St. Petersburg]], [[Florida]].]]
Since the 1950s, many nations in [[Africa]] have suffered [[civil war]]s and ethnic strife, thus generating a massive number of refugees of many different [[Nationality|nationalities]] and [[ethnic group]]s. The division of Africa into [[Europe]]an [[Colonialism|colonies]] in 1885, along which lines the newly independent nations of the 1950s and 1960s drew their borders, has been cited as a major reason why Africa has been so plagued with intrastate warfare. The number of refugees in Africa increased from 860,000 in 1968 to 6,775,000 by 1992. <ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9063038 Refugee, Encyclopædia Britannica, 2004]</ref> By the end of 2004, that number had dropped to 2,748,400 refugees, according to the [[United Nations High Commission for Refugees]]. <ref>[http://www.unhcr.ch/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/statistics/opendoc.pdf?tbl=STATISTICS&id=42b283744 UNHCR.ch]{{dead link|date=June 2010}}</ref> (That figure does not include [[internally displaced person]]s, who do not cross international borders and so do not fit the official definition of refugee.) . 

Many refugees in Africa cross into neighboring countries to find haven; often, African countries are simultaneously countries of origin for refugees and countries of asylum for other refugees. The [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], for instance, was the country of origin for 462,203 refugees at the end of 2004, but a country of asylum for 199,323 other refugees.  . 

Countries in Africa from where 5,000 or more refugees originated as of the end of 2004, arranged in descending order of numbers of refugees are listed below. <ref>[[United Nations High Commission for Refugees|UNHCR]], [http://www.unhcr.ch/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/statistics/opendoc.pdf?tbl=STATISTICS&id=42b283744 2004 Global Refugee Trends], Table 3. </ref> The largest number of refugees are from Sudan and have fled either the longstanding and recently concluded [[Second Sudanese Civil War|Sudanese Civil War]] or the [[Darfur conflict]] and are located mainly in [[Chad]], [[Uganda]], [[Ethiopia]], and [[Kenya]].  .

==== Uganda ====. 
In the 1970s [[Uganda]] and other East African nations implemented racist policies that targeted the Asian population of the region.

{{Main|Great Lakes refugee crisis}}
In the aftermath of the 1994 [[Rwandan Genocide]], over two million people fled into neighboring countries, in particular [[Zaire]]. The refugee camps were soon controlled by the former government and [[Hutu]] militants who used the camps as bases to launch attacks against the new government in [[Rwanda]]. Little action was taken to resolve the situation and the crisis did not end until Rwanda-supported rebels forced the refugees back across the border at the beginning of the [[First Congo War]].  .

An estimated 2.5 million people, roughly one-third the population of the [[Darfur]] area, have been forced to flee their homes after attacks by [[Janjaweed]] [[Arab]] militia backed by Sudanese troops during the ongoing [[Darfur conflict]] in western [[Sudan]] since roughly 2003. <ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/15/AR2006101500655.html African Union Force Ineffective, Complain Refugees in Darfur]</ref><ref>[http://news.independent.co.uk/world/africa/article2768232.ece Arabs pile into Darfur to take land 'cleansed' by janjaweed]</ref> . 

=====African refugees in Israel=====. 
Since 2003, an estimated 27,000 illegal immigrants from various African countries have crossed into Israel. <ref name="ARDC">African Refugee Development Center. Accessed: 11.11.11, [http://www.ardc-israel.org/en/about/refugees/ African Refugee Development Center]</ref> Some 600 refugees from the [[Darfur]] region of [[Sudan]] have been granted temporary resident status to be renewed every year, though not official refugee state. <ref>[http://www.acri.org.il/pdf/refugees0209en.pdf ACRI.org.il]</ref> Another 2,000 refugees from the conflict between [[Eritrea]] and [[Ethiopia]] have been granted temporary resident status on humanitarian grounds. Israel prefers not to recognize them as refugees so as not to offend Eritrea and Ethiopia, though Sudanese, who are from an enemy state, are also not recognized as refugees. In 2007, Israel deported 48 refugees back to Egypt after they succeeded in crossing the border, of which twenty were deported back to Sudan by Egyptian authorities, according to Amnesty International. In August 2008 the Israel Defense Forces deported at least another 91 African asylum seekers at the border. Throughout this year, Egyptian police have shot dead 20 African asylum seekers attempting to enter Israel. <ref>[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L490874.htm Alertnet.org]</ref> . 

====Western Sahara conflict====. 
{{main|Sahrawi refugee camps}}
It is estimated that between 165,000 - 200,000 [[Sahrawis]] – people from the disputed territory of [[Western Sahara]] – have lived in five large refugee camps near [[Tindouf Province|Tindouf]] in the Algerian part of the [[Sahara]] Desert since 1975. <ref>[http://www.afrol.com/articles/21380 EU donates €10 million to Western Sahara refugees]</ref><ref>[http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact2005/fields/2194.html Refugees and internally displaced persons]</ref> The [[UNHCR]] and [[WFP]] are presently engaged in supporting what they describe as the "90,000 most vulnerable" refugees, giving no estimate for total refugee numbers. <ref>[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=74134 Western Sahara: Lack of donor funds threatens humanitarian projects]</ref> . 

====Algerian War====. 
The [[Algerian War of Independence]] (1954–1962) uprooted more than 2 million Algerians, who were forced to relocate in French camps or to flee to Morocco, Tunisia, and into the Algerian hinterland.  . 

European-descended population, ''[[Pied-noir|Pieds-Noirs]]'', accounted for 10.4% of the total population of [[Algeria]] in 1962. In just a few months in 1962, 900,000 of them fled the country in the most massive relocation of population to Europe since the [[World War II]]. A motto used in the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] propaganda designating the Pied-noirs community was "Suitcase or coffin" ("''La valise ou le cercueil''"). <ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/11/11/europe/web.1111globalist.php On French immigrants, the words left unsaid]</ref><ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEFDE1539F935A35757C0A96E948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all For Pieds-Noirs, the Anger Endures]</ref> . 

====Libyan Civil War====. 
{{main|Refugees of the 2011 Libyan civil war}}
Refugees of the 2011 Libyan civil war are the people, predominantly of [[Libyans|Libyan nationality]], who fled or were expelled from their homes during the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], from within the borders of [[Libya]] to the neighbouring states of Tunisia, Egypt and Chad, as well as to European countries, across the Mediterranean, as [[Boat people]]. The majority of Libyan refugees are Arabs and Berbers, though many of other ethnicities, temporarily living in Libya, originated from sub-Saharan Africa, were also among the first refugee waves to exit the country. The total Libyan refugee numbers are estimated at near one million as of June 2011. About half of them had returned to Libyan territory during summer 2011, though large refugee camps on Tunisian and Chad border kept being overpopulated.  . 

===Movements in the Americas===. 
====Latin Americans====. 
[[File:Nicaraguan refugees.jpg|thumb|Nicaraguan refugees, 1979]]
More than one million [[Salvadoran]]s were displaced during the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] from 1975 to 1982.  About half went to the United States, most settling in the [[Los Angeles]] area.  There was also a large exodus of [[Guatemala]]ns during the 1980s, trying to escape from the Civil War and [[genocide]] there as well.  These people went to Southern Mexico and the U.S.  . 

From 1991 through 1994, following the military [[coup d'état]] against President [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]], thousands of [[Haiti]]ans fled violence and repression by boat. Although most were repatriated to Haiti by the U.S. government, others entered the United States as refugees. Haitians were primarily regarded as [[economic migrant]]s from the grinding poverty of Haiti, the poorest nation in the [[Western Hemisphere]].  . 

{{See also|Mariel boatlift}}
The victory of the forces led by [[Fidel Castro]] in the [[Cuban Revolution]] led to a large exodus of [[Cubans]] between 1959 and 1980. Thousands of Cubans yearly continue to risk the waters of the [[Straits of Florida]] seeking better economic and political conditions in the U.S. In 1999 the highly publicized case of six year old [[Elián González]] brought the covert migration to international attention. Measures by both governments have attempted to address the issue; the U.S. instituted a [[wet feet, dry feet policy]] allowing refuge to those travelers who manage to complete their journey, and the Cuban government have periodically allowed for mass migration by organizing leaving posts. The most famous of these agreed migrations was the [[Mariel boatlift]] of 1980.  . 

[[Colombia]] has one of the world's largest populations of [[internally displaced person]]s (IDPs), with estimates ranging from 2.6 to 4.3 million people, due to the ongoing [[Colombian armed conflict]]. The larger figure is cumulative since 1985. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/lib.nsf/db900sid/ASHU-7RR7QG/$file/IDMC_Apr2009.pdf?openelement|format=PDF|title=Internal Displacement.

====United States====. 
{{main|Asylum in the United States}}
During the [[Vietnam War]], many U.S. citizens who were [[conscientious objectors]] and wished to [[draft dodger#Draft dodging and the Vietnam War|avoid the draft]] sought political asylum in Canada.  President [[Jimmy Carter]] issued an [[amnesty]]. Since 1975, the U.S. has resettled approximately 2.6 million refugees, with nearly 77% being either Indochinese or citizens of the former Soviet Union. Since the enactment of the Refugee Act of 1980, annual admissions figures have ranged from a high of 207,116 in 1980 to a low of 27,100 in 2002.  . 

Currently, ten national [[VOLAG|voluntary agencies]] resettle refugees nationwide on behalf of the U.S. government: [[Church World Service]], Ethiopian Community Development Council, Episcopal Migration Ministries, [[Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society]], [[International Rescue Committee]], [[U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants]], Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], [[World Relief]] and State of Iowa, Bureau of Refugee Services.  . 

[[Jesuit Refugee Service|Jesuit Refugee Service/USA]] (JRS/USA) has worked to help resettle Bhutanese refugees in the United States. The mission of JRS/USA is to accompany, serve and defend the rights of refugees and other forcibly displaced persons. JRS/USA is one of 10 geographic regions of Jesuit Refugee Service, an international Catholic organization sponsored by the Society of Jesus. In coordination with JRS’s International Office in Rome, JRS/USA provides advocacy, financial and human resources for JRS regions throughout the world.  .

===Movements in Asia===. 
====Afghanistan====. 
[[File:Afghan refugees, living on the Canal Saint Martin, underneath a bridge.jpg|thumb|Afghan refugees in France, 2010]]
From the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] in 1979 until the late [[Operation Enduring Freedom|2001 US-led invasion]], about six million [[Afghan refugees]] have fled to neighboring Pakistan (mainly [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|NWFP]]) and Iran, making [[Afghanistan]] the largest refugee-producing country. Since early 2002, more than 5 million Afghan refugees have [[Repatriation|repatriated]] through the UNHCR from both Pakistan and Iran back to their native country, Afghanistan. <ref>[[Pajhwok Afghan News]] (PAN), [http://www.pajhwok.com/viewstory.asp?lng=eng&id=44975 ''UNHCR hails Pakistan as an important partner (Nov. 3, 2007)'']</ref> Approximately 3.5 million from Pakistan<ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/page?page=49e487016 2010 UNHCR country operations profile - Pakistan]</ref> while the remaining 1.5 million from Iran. Since 2007 the Iranian government has forcibly deported mostly unregistered (and some registered) Afghan refugees back to Afghanistan, with 362,000 being deported in 2008. <ref name="Fars">{{cite news|url=http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=8807141624|title=Afghanistan denies laxity in visa rules |date=2009-10-06|publisher=[[Fars News Agency]]|accessdate=2009-10-10}}</ref> . 

As of March 2009, some 1.7 million registered Afghan refugees still remain in Pakistan.

====Dissolution of the British Raj, The Partition of 1947 and Independence====. 
The partition of the [[British Raj]] provinces of [[Punjab region|Panjab]] and [[Bangal]] and the subsequent independence of [[Pakistan]] and one day later of [[India]] in 1947 resulted '''in the largest human movement in history'''. In this population exhange approximately 7 million [[Hindus]] and [[Sikhs]] from [[Bangladesh]] and [[Pakistan]] moved to [[India]] while approximately 7 million [[Muslims]] from [[India]] moved to [[Pakistan]]. Approximately one million [[Muslim]]s, [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s died during this event. [citation required for the figures] . 

====Bangladeshis in India in 1971====. 
As a result of the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], on 27 March 1971, Prime Minister of India, [[Indira Gandhi]], expressed full support of her Government to the Bangladeshi struggle for freedom. The Bangladesh-India border was opened to allow panic-stricken Bangladeshis' safe shelter in India. The governments of [[West Bengal]], [[Bihar]], [[Assam]], [[Meghalaya]] and [[Tripura]] established refugee camps along the border. Exiled Bangladeshi army officers and the Indian military immediately started using these camps for recruitment and training members of [[Mukti Bahini]]. During the Bangladesh War of Independence around 10 million [[Bangladeshis]] fled the country to escape the killings and [[1971 Bangladesh atrocities|atrocities]] committed by the [[Pakistan]] Army. 
Bangladeshi refugees known as '"Chakmas"' in [[India]].  . 

====Pakistani Biharis in Bangladesh after 1971====. 
During the period of united Pakistan (1947–1971), the [[Urdu]]-speaking [[Biharis]] were not assimilated into the society of [[East Pakistan]] and remained a distinct cultural-linguistic group. Due to being a different linguistic group they were assaulted by [[Bengalis]] and the [[Indian Army]] in [[Bangladesh Liberation War|the 1971 war]]. Many atrocities took place against Biharis and even after the war they are still living in the same conditions. At the end of the war many Biharis took shelter in refugee camps in different cities, the biggest being the Geneva Camp in Dhaka. It is estimated that about 250,000 Biharis are living in those camps today, with problems like continuous atrocities by the local Bengali population, rape on young girls, malnutrition and poor hygiene and living conditions.  . 

====Rohingyas in Bangladesh and Pakistan from Burma====. 
[[Bangladesh]] hosts more than 250,000 [[Muslim]] [[Rohingya]] refugees forced from western [[Burma]] (Myanmar) who fled in 1991-92 to escape persecution by the Burmese military junta. Many have lived there for close to twenty years.  The Bangladeshi government divides the Rohingya into two categories - recognized refugees living in official camps and unrecognized refugees living in unofficial sites or among Bangladeshi communities.  Around 30,000 Rohingyas are residing in two camps in Nayapara and Kutupalong area of [[Cox's Bazar]] district in Bangladesh. These camp residents have access to basic services, those outside do not.  With no changes inside Burma in sight, Bangladesh must come to terms with the long-term needs of all the Rohingya refugees in the country, and allow international organizations to expand services that benefit the Rohingya as well as local communities.  . 

The agency has been supporting Rohingya refugees staying in the camps. On the other hand, it is not receiving applications for refugee status from the newly arrived Rohingyas. This amounts to compromising of its mandate. 
The brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing of Muslims in Arakan State by the Burmese military in 1991-92 thousands of people have been detained in crowded refugee camps in Bangladesh and tens of thousands have been repatriated to Burma to face further repression. There are widespread allegations of religious persecution, use of forced labor and denial of citizenship of many Rohingya forced to return to Burma since 1996. 
Many have fled again to Bangladesh to seek work or shelter, or flee from Burmese military oppression, and some are forced across the border by Burmese security forces. In the past few months, abuses against Rohingya in [[Arakan State]] has continued, including strict registration laws that continue to deny Rohingya citizenship, restrictions on movement, land confiscation and forced evictions to make way for Buddhist Burmese settlements, widespread forced labor in infrastructure projects and closure of some mosques, including nine in North Buthidaung Township of Western Arakan State in the last half of 2006. <ref>[http://www.refintl.org/blog/photo-report/luck-draw-rohingya-refugees-bangladesh Luck of the Draw: Rohingya Refugees in Bangladesh]</ref><ref>[http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2007/03/26/rohingya-refugees-burma-mistreated-bangladesh Human Rights Watch : Rohingya Refugees from Burma Mistreated in Bangladesh]</ref><ref>[http://www.rohingya.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=191&Itemid=28 Web site of Arakan Rohingya National Organisation]</ref> . 

There are also large number of [[Muslim]] [[Burmese people in Pakistan|Rohingya refugees]] in [[Pakistan]]. Most of them have made perilous journey across [[Bangladesh]] and [[India]] and have settled in [[Karachi]].  . 

====Himalayas====. 
After the [[1959 Tibetan exodus]], there are more than 150,000 [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] who live in [[India]], many in settlements in [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamsala]] and [[Mysore]], and Nepal.  These include people who have escaped over the [[Himalayas]] from [[Tibet]], as well as their children and grandchildren. In India the overwhelming majority of Tibetans born in India are still stateless and carry a document called an Identity Card issued by the Indian government in lieu of a passport. This document states the nationality of the holder as Tibetan. It is a document that is frequently rejected as a valid travel document by many customs and immigrations departments. The Tibetan refugees also own a [[Green Book (Tibetan document)|Green Book]] issued by the [[Tibetan Government in Exile]] for rights and duties towards this administration.  . 

In 1991–92, Bhutan expelled roughly 100,000 ethnic [[Nepali people|Nepalis]] known as [[Lhotshampa]]s from the southern part of the country. Most of them have been living in seven refugee camps run by UNHCR in eastern Nepal ever since; some of them resettled in India. In March 2008, this population began a multiyear resettlement to third countries including the United States, New Zealand, Denmark, Canada, Norway and Australia. At present, the United States is working towards resettling more than 60,000 of these refugees in the US as a third country settlement programme. <ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7082586.stm | title = Bhutan refugees are 'intimidated' | author = Bhaumik, Subir | date = November 7, 2007 | work = BBC News | accessdate = 2008-04-25}}</ref> . 

Meanwhile, as many as 200,000 Nepalese were displaced during the [[Maoist]] insurgency and [[Nepalese Civil War]] which ended in 2006.  .

====Sri Lanka====. 
{{Main|Sri Lankan diaspora|Sri Lankan IDP camps}}
The [[Sri Lankan Civil War|civil war]] in [[Sri Lanka]], from 1983 to 2009 had generated thousands of internally displaced people as well as refugees. Many Sri Lankans have fled to neighbourly [[India]] and western countries such as [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Denmark]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Germany]]. Refugees travel through Malaysia and/or Thailand and Indonesia before moving into Australia or Canada by illegal means such as boat or plane.{{Citation needed|reason=where did you get this number?|date=May 2011}} . 

==== Jammu and Kashmir ====. 
According to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), about 300,000 [[Kashmiri Pandits]] have been forced to leave the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] due to militancy and religious discrimination, making them refugees in their own country. <ref>[http://www.mid-day.com/opinion/2012/jan/190112-opinion-Kashmiri-Pandits-The-Forgotten-Victims.htm]</ref> Some have found refuge in [[Jammu]] and it's adjoining areas, while others in camps in [[Delhi]] and others in other states of [[India]] and other countries too.

====Southeast Asia (Vietnam War)====. 
Following the communist takeovers in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos in 1975, about three million people attempted to escape in the subsequent decades. With massive influx of refugees daily, the resources of the receiving countries were severely strained. The plight of the [[boat people]] became an international humanitarian crisis. The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) set up refugee camps in neighboring countries to process the boat people. The budget of the UNHCR increased from $80 million in 1975 to $500 million in 1980. Partly for its work in Indochina, the UNHCR was awarded the 1981 Nobel Peace Prize.  . 

*Large numbers of Vietnamese refugees came into existence after 1975 when [[South Vietnam]] fell to the [[Vietnam People's Army|communist forces]]. Many tried to escape, some by boat, thus giving rise to the phrase "[[boat people]]". The Vietnamese refugees emigrated to [[Hong Kong]], France, the United States, [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and other countries, creating sizeable expatriate communities, notably in the United States. Since 1975, an estimated 1.4 million refugees from Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries have been resettled to the United States. <ref>"[http://www.migrationinformation.org/Feature/display.cfm?ID=585 Refugee Resettlement in Metropolitan America]".

*Survivors of the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime in [[Cambodia]] fled across the border into [[Thailand]] after the Vietnamese invasion of 1978–79.  Approximately 300,000 of these people were eventually resettled in the United States, France, [[Canada]], and [[Australia]] between 1979 and 1992, when the camps were closed and the remaining people repatriated. 
*Nearly 400,000 Laotians fled to Thailand after the [[Vietnam War]] and Communist Take over in 1975.Some left because of persecution by the government for religious or ethnic purposes.Most left between 1976–1985 and lived in refugee camps along the border between [[Thailand]] and [[Laos]].They mostly settled in the United States, [[Canada]], France, and [[Australia]].In the United States they mostly settled in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] State, [[California]], [[Washington DC]], [[Texas]], [[Virginia]], and [[Minnesota]]. 
*The Mien or [[Yao people|Yao]] recently lived in northern [[Vietnam]], northern [[Laos]] and northern [[Thailand]]. In 1975, the [[Pathet Lao]] forces began seeking reprisal for the involvement of many Mien as soldiers in the [[CIA]]-sponsored [[Laotian Civil War|Secret War]] in Laos. As a token of appreciation to the Mien and [[Hmong people]] who served in the [[CIA]] secret army, the United States accepted many of the refugees as [[Naturalization|naturalized]] [[Citizenship|citizen]]s ([[Mien American]]). Many more [[Hmong people|Hmong]] continue to seek asylum in neighboring Thailand. <ref>[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/07/national/national_30005937.php Nationmultimedia.com]</ref>
*Due to the persecution of the ethnic [[Karen people|Karen]], [[Karenni]] and other minority populations in Burma ([[Myanmar]]) significant numbers of refugees live along the Thai border in camps of up to 100,000 people.

===Movements in Europe===. 
====World War II refugee issues====. 
=====Jewish refugees=====. 
{{See|Jewish refugees}}
Between the first and second world wars, Jewish immigration to the [[British Mandate for Palestine]] was encouraged by the nascent [[zionism|Zionist movement]], but was restricted by the [[British mandate of Palestine|British Mandate]] government, under the pressure of Arab nationalists. In Europe, [[Nazism|Nazi]] persecution culminated in the [[Holocaust]] and the mass murder of millions of European Jews.  . 

The [[Evian Conference]], [[Bermuda Conference]], and others failed to resolve the problem of finding a home for large numbers of [[Jewish refugees]] from Nazi-occupied Europe.  Following its formation in 1948, according to [[1947 UN Partition Plan]], Israel adopted the [[Law of Return]], granting Israeli citizenship to any Jewish immigrant.  . 

====European Union====. 
According to the [[European Council on Refugees and Exiles]], a network of European refugee-assisting [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), huge differences exist between national asylum systems in Europe, making the asylum system a 'lottery' for refugees. For example, Iraqis who flee their home country and end up in Germany have an 85% chance of being recognised as a refugee and those who apply for asylum in Slovenia do not get a protection status at all. <ref>[http://www.ecre.org/topics/asylum_in_EU European Council on Refugees and Exiles (ECRE) - Asylum in the EU]</ref> . 

====France====. 
In 2010, President [[Nicholas Sarkozy]] began the systematic expulsion of [[Romani people|Roma]] from France forcing thousands from France to [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]] or elsewhere. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11027288 | work=BBC News | title=Q&A: France Roma expulsions | date=2010-10-19}}</ref> . 

====Hungary====. 
In 1956–57 following the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] nearly 200,000 persons, about two percent of the population of [[Hungary]], fled as refugees to [[Austria]] and [[West Germany]]. <ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/photos?set=hungarian_refugees The Lives of the Hungarian Refugees], UNHCR</ref> . 

====Czechoslovakia====. 
The [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in 1968 was followed by a wave of emigration, unseen before and stopped shortly after (estimate: 70,000 immediately, 300,000 in total),<ref>[http://www.britskelisty.cz/9808/19980821h.html "Day when tanks destroyed Czech dreams of Prague Spring" (''Den, kdy tanky zlikvidovaly české sny Pražského jara'') at Britské Listy (British Letters)]</ref> typic . 

====Balkans====. 
Following the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946–1949) hundreds of thousands of Greeks and Ethnic Macedonians were expelled or fled the country. The number of refugees ranged from 35,000 to over 213,000. Over 28,000 children were evacuated by the Partisans to the Eastern Bloc and the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]]. This left thousands of [[Greeks]] and [[Aegean Macedonians]] spread across the world.  . 

The [[forced assimilation]] campaign of the late 1980s directed against ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks]] resulted in the emigration of some 300,000 [[Turks in Bulgaria|Bulgarian Turks]] to Turkey.

Beginning in 1991, political upheavals in the [[Balkans]] such as the breakup of [[Yugoslavia]], displaced about 2,700,000 people by mid-1992, of which over 700,000 of them sought asylum in Europe. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/specials/bosnia/context/dayton.html Bosnia: Dayton Accords]</ref><ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E3D61339F937A15752C1A963958260&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/I/Immigration%20and%20Refugees Resettling Refugees: U.N.

Today there are still thousands of refugees and internally [[displaced person]]s in the Balkan Region who cannot return to their homes. Most of them are [[Serbs]] who cannot return to [[Kosovo]], and who still live in refugee camps in Serbia today. Over 200,000 Serbs and other non-Albanian minorities fled or were expelled from Kosovo after the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999. <ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/serbia/article/0,,1713498,00.html Serbia threatens to resist Kosovo independence plan]</ref><ref>[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2004/03/18/serbia8129.htm Kosovo/Serbia: Protect Minorities from Ethnic Violence (Human Rights Watch)]</ref> . 

Refugees and IDPs in [[Serbia]] form between 7% and 7.5% of its population – about half a million refugees sought refuge in the country following the series of [[Yugoslav wars]] (from Croatia mainly, to an extent [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] too and the IDPs from [[Kosovo]], which are the most numerous at over 200,000). <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rb.html |title=Serbia |accessdate= |author=The World Factbook |authorlink=The World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency }}</ref> Serbia has the largest refugee population in Europe. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society-article.php?yyyy=2007&mm=10&dd=22&nav_id=44785 |title=Serbia's refugee population largest in Europe |accessdate= |author=Tanjug |authorlink=Tanjug |date=22 October 2007 |publisher=B92 }}</ref> . 

====Chechnya====. 
From 1992 [[Second Chechen War|ongoing conflict]] has taken place in [[Chechenya]], [[Caucasus]] due to independence proclaimed by this republic in 1991 which is not accepted by the [[Russian Federation]] or any other state in the world. As a consequence about 2 million people have been displaced and still cannot return to their homes. At the end of the Soviet era, ethnic [[Russians]] comprised about 23% of the population (269,000 in 1989). Due to widespread lawlessness and ethnic cleansing under the government of [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]] most non-Chechens (and many [[Chechen people|Chechens]] as well) fled the country during the 1990s or were killed. <ref>[http://www.chechnyaadvocacy.org/refugees.html Chechnya Advocacy Network.

===Movements in the Middle East===. 
====Jews and Assyrian Christians transfers, forced migrations between 1843 and the 21st century==== . 

In his recent PhD thesis <ref>[[Mordechai Zaken]],"[[Tribal chieftains and their Jewish Subjects: A comparative Study in Survival]]: PhD Thesis, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2004. </ref> and in his recent book <ref>[[Mordechai Zaken]],"[[Jewish Subjects and their tribal chieftains in Kurdistan]]: A Study in Survival", Brill: Leiden and Boston, 2007. </ref> the Israeli scholar Mordechai Zaken discussed the history of the Assyrian Christians of Turkey and Iraq (in the Kurdish vicinity) during the last 180 years, from 1843 onwards. In his studies Zaken outlines three major eruptions that took place between 1843 and 1933 during which the Assyrian Christians lost their land and hegemony in their habitat in the Hakkārī (or Julamerk) region in southeastern Turkey and became refugees in other lands, notably Iran and Iraq, and ultimately in exiled communities in European and western countries (the USA, Canada, Australia, New-Zealand, Sweden, France, to mention some of these countries). Mordechai Zaken wrote this important study from an analytical and comparative point of view, comparing the Assyrian Christians experience with the experience of the Kurdish Jews who had been dwelling in Kurdistan for two thousands years or so, but were forced to migrate the land to Israel in the early 1950s. The Jews of Kurdistan were forced to leave and migrate as a result of the Arab-Israeli war, as a result of the increasing hostility and acts of violence against Jews in Iraq and Kurdish towns and villages, and as a result of a new situation that had been built up during the 1940s in Iraq and Kurdistan in which the ability of Jews to live in relative comfort and relative tolerance (that was erupted from time to time prior to that period) with their Arab and Muslim neighbors, as they did for many years, practically came to an end. At the end, the Jews of Kurdistan had to leave their Kurdish habitat en masse and migrate into Israel. The Assyrian Christians on the other hand, came to similar conclusion but migrated in stages following each and every eruption of a political crisis with the regime in which boundaries they lived or following each conflict with their Muslim, Turkish, Arabs or Kurdish neighbors, or following the departure or expulsion of their patriarch Mar Shimon in 1933, first to Cyprus and then to the United States. Consequently, indeed there is still a small and fragile community of Assyrians in Iraq, however,  millions of Assyrian Christians live today in exiled and prosperous communities in the west. <ref>[ ^ Joyce Blau, one of the world's leading scholars in the Kurdish culture, languages and history, suggested that "This part of Mr. Zaken’s thesis, concerning Jewish life in Iraqi Kurdistan, "well complements the impressive work of the pioneer ethnologist Erich Brauer." Brauer was indeed one of the most skilled ethnographs of the first half of the 20th century and wrote an important book on the Jews of Kurdistan [Erich Brauer, The Jews of Kurdistan, First edition 1940, revised edition 1993, completed and edited par Raphael Patai, Wayne State University Press, Detroit])</ref> . 

====Arab-Israeli wars 1947-1973====. 
=====Palestinian Arabs=====. 
{{See|Palestinian refugees}}
{{double image|right|Lebanese travel document for palestinians.jpg|95|Egypt travel document for palestinians.jpg|95|Lebanese and Egyptian [[refugee travel document|travel documents]] for Palestinian refugees}}
Following the 1948 proclamation of the [[State of Israel]], the first [[1948 Arab-Israeli War|Arab-Israeli War]] began. By then, many [[Palestinian people|Palestinian Arabs]] had already left territories, controlled by Palestinian Jews, some through their own choice and some fleeing the coming warfare and in some cases expulsions, causing them to become [[Palestinian refugees|refugees]]. The [[1948 Palestinian exodus]] continued through the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] and after the armistice that ended it. The [[Estimates of the Palestinian Refugee flight of 1948|final estimate of 1948 refugee numbers]] was 711,000, according to the [[United Nations]] Conciliation Commission. After the war, the Palestinian displaced persons of the Gaza strip came under the governance of Egypt and the [[All-Palestine government]], while in the West Bank and Jordan most of them were granted citizenship of the Hashemite Kingdom. Palestinian Arab population, which stayed within the Israeli controlled territories, or was displaced within its borders was granted Israeli citizenship.  . 

Palestinian refugees from 1948 and their descendants do not come under the 1951 UN [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]], but under the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East|UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East]], which created its own criteria for refugee classification. The great majority of Palestinian refugees have kept the refugee status for generations, under a special decree of the UN. Many of them were not permitted to come back to their homes or resettle within the former Mandate Palestine territory, altogether in Israeli controlled territories, the Egyptian controlled Gaza strip and the Jordanian controlled West Bank. Resettlement was technically almost banned by Arab governments in other Arab States as well (Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait), where many Palestinian refugees had arrived after the war, until "the full solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict is achieved". As such they, like the holders of Nansen Passports, Certificates of Eligibility, and UNHCR refugees <ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html] “according to the official commentary of the ad hoc Committee on Statelessness and Related Problems (E/1618, p. 40), the rights granted to a refugee are extended to members of his family”</ref><ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/3ae6b3314.pdf] “Thus, a holder of a so-called Nansen Passport or a Certificate of Eligibility issued by the International Refugee Organization must be considered a refugee under the 1951 Convention unless one of the cessation clauses has become applicable to his case or he is excluded from the application of the Convention by one of the exclusion clauses. This also applies to a surviving child of a statutory refugee.”</ref> are legally defined to include descendants of refugees, as well as others who might otherwise be considered [[internally displaced person]]s.  . 

As of December 2005, the World Refugee Survey of the [[U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants]] estimates the total number of Palestinian refugees and their descendants to be 2,966,100. [[Palestinian refugees]] number almost half of Jordan's population, however they have assimilated into Jordanian society, having a full citizenship. In Syria, though not officially becoming citizens, most of the Palestinian refugees were granted resident rights and issued Syrian passports. Following the Oslo Agreements, attempts were made to integrate the displaced Palestinians and their descendants into the Palestinian community. In addition, Israel granted permissions for family reunions and return of about 10,000 Fatach members to the West Bank. The refugee situation and the presence of [[List of Palestinian refugee camps|numerous refugee camps]] continues to be a point of contention in the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]].  . 

=====Jews of Arab and Muslim countries=====. 
{{main|Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries}}
[[File:Iraqi jews displaced 1951.jpg‎|thumb|Displaced [[Iraqi Jews]] arrive in Israel, 1951]]
Jews have lived in what are now Arab states at least since the [[Babylonian captivity]] (597 BCE). First the rise of antisemitism and later the refusal of the Arab world to accept the existence of a Jewish state led to increased discrimination and violence against the Jews. In 1948, the [[Arab League]] declared the Jews as enemy citizens. Jewish bank accounts and property was confiscated, Jews were arrested and fired from their jobs, and synagogues were attacked<ref name="haaretz1">[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/941518.html Haaretz.com], ''All I wanted was justice''. </ref> Following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the number of [[History of the Jews under Muslim rule|Jews in Arab countries]] fell steeply: some 10,000 former Palestinain Jews were forced out of their homes in Jerusalem, Hebron and other cities of the West Bank by Jordan throughout the war;{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} following the war the numbers fell in Yemen from 55,000 to 4,000; in Iraq from 135,000 to 6,000; in Aden from 8,000 to 800; in Egypt from 80,000 to 50,000; in Libya from 38,000 to 4,000; and in Syria from 30,000 to 5,000. <ref name="haaretz1"/> . 

According to official Arab statistics, 856,000 Jews fled and abandoned their homes in Arab countries from 1948 until the early 1970s. Approximately 600,000-700,000 of Jewish refugees flooded into Israel, and were largely housed in temporary transition camps, called [[ma'abarot]]. The plight of the Jews in Arab countries worsened following the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], prompting the exodus of most of the remaining Jewish population. Their descendants, and those of Iranian and Turkish Jews, now number 3.06 million of Israel's 5.4 to 5.8 million Jewish citizens. <ref name=aiwwj>Schwartz, Adi. [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/941518.html "All I wanted was justice"] ''[[Haaretz]]''. 10 January 2008. </ref> Very few Jews live in Arab countries today. </ref> . 

In 2007, similar resolutions (H.Res.185 and S.Res.85) were proposed to the US [[United States Senate|Senate]] and [[united states congress|Congress]], to: <blockquote>Make clear that the United States Government supports the position that, as an integral part of any comprehensive peace, the issue of refugees and the mass violations of human rights of minorities in Arab and Muslim countries throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and the Persian Gulf must be resolved in a manner that includes (A) consideration of the legitimate rights of all refugees displaced from Arab and Muslim countries throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and the Persian Gulf; and (B) recognition of the losses incurred by Jews, Christians, and other minority groups as a result of the Arab-Israeli conflict. <ref>[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:sr85is.txt.pdf S.

====Cyprus crisis of 1974====. 
It is estimated that 40% of the [[Greek Cypriots|Greek]] population of [[Cyprus]], as well as over half of the [[Turkish Cypriots|Turkish Cypriot]] population, were displaced during the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974. The figures for [[Cypriot refugees|internally displaced Cypriots]] varies, the United Peacekeeping force in Cyprus ([[UNFICYP]]) estimates 165,000 Greek Cypriots and 45,000 Turkish Cypriots. The [[UNHCR]] registers slightly higher figures of 200,000 and 65,000 respectively, being partly based on official Cypriot statistics which register children of displaced families as refugees. <ref>[http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpCountrySummaries)/404B5F063033BD4B802570C00056B6EA?OpenDocument&count=10000 internal-displacement.org]</ref> The separation of the two communities via the UN patrolled Green Line prohibited the return of all internally displaced people.  . 

====Lebanon Civil War crisis====.

[[Image:Turkey 04.jpg|thumb|Refugees in Turkey]]
Between 1984 and 1999, the [[PKK]] and the [[Turkey|Turkish]] military engaged in open war, and much of the countryside in the southeast was depopulated, with [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] civilians moving to local defensible centers such as [[Diyarbakır]], [[Van, Turkey|Van]], and [[Şırnak]], as well as to the cities of western Turkey and even to western Europe. The causes of the depopulation included PKK atrocities against Kurdish clans they could not control, the poverty of the southeast, and the Turkish state's military operations. <ref>Radu, Michael.

The [[Iran–Iraq War]] from 1980 to 1988, the 1990 [[Iraqi invasion of Kuwait]], the first [[Gulf War]] and subsequent conflicts all generated hundreds of thousands if not millions of refugees.  Iran also provided asylum for 1,400,000 Iraqi refugees who had been uprooted as a result of the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] (1990–91). At least one million Iraqi [[Kurds]] were displaced during the [[Al-Anfal Campaign]] (1986–1989).  .

Furthermore, the small [[Mandaeans|Mandaean]] and [[Yazidi]] communities are at the risk of elimination due to [[ethnic cleansing]] by [[Islam]]ic militants. <ref>{{cite news|last=Crawford|first=Angus|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6412453.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=2007-03-04|title=Iraq's Mandaeans 'face extinction' }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Damon|first=Arwa|coauthors=Mohammed Tawfeeq and Raja Razek|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/08/15/iraq.main/index.html?iref=topnews |title= Iraqi officials: Truck bombings killed at least 500|publisher=CNN|date=2007-08-15 }}</ref> Entire neighborhoods in [[Baghdad]] were ethnically cleansed by [[Shia]] and [[Sunni]] Militias. <ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/iraq-is-disintegrating-as-ethnic-cleansing-takes-hold-478937.html Iraq is disintegrating as ethnic cleansing takes hold]</ref><ref>[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/784/sc4.htm "There is ethnic cleansing"]</ref> Satellite shows ethnic cleansing in Iraq was key factor in "surge" success. <ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSN1953066020080919 Satellite images show ethnic cleanout in Iraq], Reuters, September 19, 2008</ref> . 

=====Refuge in Jordan=====. 
Jordan has one of the world's largest immigrant populations with some sources putting the immigrant percentage to being 60%. Jordan's religious toleration, political stability, and economic prosperity has made Jordan attractive to those fleeing violence and persecution.  Jordan also has a higher quality of life compared to other countries in the region with high literacy rates, excellent healthcare infrastructure, and a relatively liberal social and economic environment. [[Iraqi refugees]] number between 750,000 and 1 million in Jordan with most living in Amman. Jordan also has Armenian, Chechen, Circassian, and Mexican minorities.  . 

====2011 Syrian refugees====. 
{{main|Refugees of the 2011 Syrian uprising}} . 

====Religious minorities in the Middle East====. 
The [[US government]] position on refugees states that there is repression of religious [[minorities]] in the [[Middle East]] and in [[Pakistan]] such as [[Christians]], [[Hindus]], as well as [[Ahmadi]], and [[Zikri]] denominations of Islam. In [[Sudan]] where [[Islam]] is the state religion, [[Muslims]] dominate the Government and restrict activities of [[Christians]], practitioners of traditional [[African]] [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] religions and other non-[[Muslims]]. <ref>[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51662.htm State.gov]</ref> The question of [[Jewish]], [[Christian]] and other refugees from [[Arab]] and [[Muslim]] countries was introduced in March 2007 in the [[US congress]]. <ref name="CJnews.com"/> . 

==Refugee issues==. 
===Medical problems===. 
Apart from physical wounds or starvation, a large percentage of refugees develop symptoms of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) or [[Clinical depression|depression]]. These long-term mental problems can severely impede the functionality of the person in everyday situations; it makes matters even worse for displaced persons who are confronted with a new environment and challenging situations. They are also at high risk for [[suicide]]. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/auspac/01/27/aust.detainee.suicide/index.html | work=CNN | title=Detainee children 'in suicide pact' | date=2002-01-28 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref> . 

Among other symptoms, post-traumatic stress disorder involves [[anxiety]], over-alertness, sleeplessness, [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], motor difficulties, failing [[short term memory]], [[amnesia]], nightmares and sleep-paralysis. Flashbacks are characteristic to the disorder: The patient experiences the [[traumatic event (psychological)|traumatic event]], or pieces of it, again and again. Depression is also characteristic for PTSD-patients and may also occur without accompanying PTSD.  . 

PTSD was diagnosed in 34.1% of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] children, most of whom were refugees, [[male]]s, and working. The participants were 1,000 children aged 12 to 16 years from governmental, private, and United Nations Relief Work Agency [[UNRWA]] schools in East Jerusalem and various governorates in the West Bank. <ref>Khamis, V. ''Post-traumatic stress disorder among school age Palestinian children.'' Child Abuse Negl. 2005 Jan;29(1):81–95. <br></ref> . 

Another study showed that 28.3% of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]n refugee women had symptoms of PTSD three or four years after their arrival in Sweden. These women also had significantly higher [[risk]]s of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and psychological distress than Swedish-born women. For depression the odds ratio was 9.50 among Bosnian women. <ref>Sundquist K, Johansson LM, DeMarinis V, Johansson SE, Sundquist J. ''Posttraumatic stress disorder and psychiatric co-morbidity: symptoms in a random sample of female Bosnian refugees.'' Eur Psychiatry. 2005 Mar;20(2):158–64. <br></ref> . 

A study by the Department of Pediatrics and Emergency Medicine at the [[Boston University]] School of Medicine demonstrated that twenty percent of Sudanese refugee minors living in the United States had a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. They were also more likely to have worse scores on all the Child Health Questionnaire subscales. <ref>Geltman PL, Grant-Knight W, Mehta SD, Lloyd-Travaglini C, Lustig S, Landgraf JM, Wise PH. ''The "lost boys of Sudan": functional and behavioral health of unaccompanied refugee minors re-settled in the United States.'' Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 2005 Jun;159(6):585–91. <br></ref> . 

Many more studies illustrate the problem. One [[meta-study]] was conducted by the psychiatry department of [[Oxford University]] at Warneford Hospital in the United Kingdom. Twenty [[Statistical survey|survey]]s were analyzed, providing results for 6,743 adult refugees from seven countries. In the larger studies, 9% were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and 5% with major depression, with evidence of much psychiatric co-morbidity. Five surveys of 260 refugee children from three countries yielded a [[prevalence]] of 11% for post-traumatic stress disorder. According to this study, refugees resettled in Western countries could be about ten times more likely to have PTSD than age-matched general populations in those countries. Worldwide, tens of thousands of refugees and former refugees resettled in Western countries probably have post-traumatic stress disorder. <ref>Fazel M, Wheeler J, Danesh J. ''Prevalence of serious mental disorder in 7000 refugees resettled in western countries: a [[systematic review]].'' Lancet. 2005 Apr 9–15;365(9467):1309–14. <br></ref> . 

===Exploitation===. 
{{See also|Human trafficking}}
Refugee populations consist of people who are terrified and are away from familiar surroundings. There can be instances of exploitation at the hands of enforcement officials, citizens of the host country, and even United Nations peacekeepers. Instances of
human rights violations, child labor, mental and physical trauma/torture, violence-related trauma, and [[Sexual exploitation and abuse in humanitarian response|sexual exploitation]], especially of children, are not entirely unknown. In many refugee camps in three war-torn West African countries, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia, young girls were found to be exchanging sex for money, a handful of fruit, or even a bar of soap. Most of these girls were between 13 and 18 years of age.  In most cases, if the girls had been forced to stay, they would had been forced into marriage.  They became pregnant around the age of 15 on average.  This happened as recently as in 2001. Parents tended to turn a blind eye because sexual exploitation had become a "mechanism of survival" in these camps. <ref>Aggrawal A. (2005) "Refugee Medicine" in : Payne-James JJ, Byard RW, Corey TS, Henderson C (Eds.) Encyclopedia of Forensic and Legal Medicine, Elsevier Academic Press: London, Vol. 3, Pp. 514–525. </ref> .
