'''Illegal immigration''' is the migration into a state in violation of the immigration laws and sovereignty of that nation. Illegal immigration raises many political, economical and social issues and has become a source of major controversy in developed countries and the more successful developing countries.   . 

In 2010, the [[International Organization for Migration]] (IOM) estimated that 25.5 to 32.1 million people (or 10%–15%) of the world's total 214 million international immigrants are illegal immigrants, though the IOM notes that it is difficult to make accurate estimates.

===Lack Of Immigration Law Enforcement, Illegal Immigration Amnesty and Birth Right Citizenship===. 
{{refimprove section|date=March 2012}}
The [[Center for Immigration Studies]] (CIS), an organization that advocates for immigration reduction in the United States, cites a lack of enforcement or the inadequate enforcement of existing immigration and border laws by the Executive Branch of the U.S government as a primary cause of illegal immigration. In the U.S., 11-20 million illegal immigrants have very low chances of being deported and only a very small fraction of companies that hire them are ever penalized.  In many states, illegal immigrants are released without deportation from jails and prisons after convictions for violent crimes. In most states, illegal immigrants attend schools and colleges, receive taxpayer assistance programs, and replace American workers and legal immigrants in jobs with infinitesimal chances of encountering immigration enforcement agents or policies. These low enforcement levels continue despite massive outcry from the American public and a large volume of certified scientific polling data showing super majorities of Americans in support of existing U.S. immigration laws. Many American activists and illegal immigration reduction groups have argued that the under-enforcement of U.S. immigration laws constitutes a Constitutional crisis since the will of the American public and actual legislation passed by Congress has little or no impact on policy undertaken by the Executive Branch under both Republican and Democratic administrations.  In addition to lack of immigration law enforcement the potential for a future illegal immigration amnesty and birth right citizenship for future children are significant contributors to the decision of a person to illegally immigrate and to remain in a country as an illegal immigrant.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}  The United States is one of only two high average income countries (the other country is Canada which offers it in limited circumstances) that still gives birthright citizenship for children born where both parents are illegal immigrants, tourists, visitors or other types of temporary residents (diplomats excepted). <ref name=feere>{{cite web|url=http://www.cis.org/birthright-citizenship|title=Birthright Citizenship in the United States: A Global Comparison|first=John|last=Feere|date=August 2010|accessdate=2012-03-04|work=Center for Immigration Studies}}</ref> . 

===Economics and labor markets===. 
Illegal immigration occurs principally from countries with lower [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] circumstances to countries with higher socio-economic circumstances, where illegal immigrants perceive greater economic opportunities and quality of life.  This has typically been viewed as driving people from [[developing countries]] to [[developed countries]] but as economic conditions improve in a number of developing countries, illegal immigration to these more successful developing countries has also increased significantly. <ref>{{cite journal|first=Mark|last=Taylor|title=The Drivers of Immigration in Contemporary Society: Unequal Distribution of Resources and Opportunities|work=Human Ecology|volume=35|number=6|date=December 2007|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/3194641502768341|accessdate=2009-12-10}}</ref> . 

When potential illegal immigrants believe the probability and benefits of successfully migrating to the destination country are greater than the costs, illegal immigration will then be an attractive option.  The benefits taken into account not only include expected improvements in pay and living conditions but also include expectations in relation to potential future immigration amnesty<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cis.org/Kephart/Cecilia-Munoz-Embraces-Amnesty|title=White House Embraces Administrative Amnesty After Failing to Get Congress on Board|first=Janice|last=Kephart|date=August 19, 2011|accessdate=2012-03-04|work=Center for Immigration Studies}}</ref>, where illegal immigration is given a path to naturalization or citizenship and also the rights to citizenship of future children are a consideration. <ref name=feere/>  The costs may include restrictions on living as an illegal immigrant in the destination country, leaving family and ways of life behind, and the probability of being detained and resulting sanctions. <ref>{{cite journal|first=V. M.|last=Briggs|title=The State of U.S. Immigration Policy: The Quandary of Economic Methodology and the Relevance of Economic Research to Know|work=Journal of Law, Economics and Policy|volume=5|number=1|date=2009|pages=177-193|url=http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/articles/256|accessdate=2009-12-10}}</ref>  Proposed economic models of illegal immigration include varying considerations and degrees of complexity.  . 

===Neoclassical model===. 
The neoclassical economic model looks only at the probability of success in immigrating and finding employment, and the increase in real income an illegal immigrant can expect.  This explanation would account for the economies of the two states, including how much of a "pull" the destination country has in terms of better-paying jobs and improvements in quality of life.  It also describes a "push" that comes from negative conditions in the home country like lack of employment or economic mobility.  . 

Neoclassical theory posits that factors such as geographic proximity, border enforcement, probability and consequences of arrest, ease of illegal employment, and chances of future legalization govern the likelihood of "successful" illegal immigration. <ref name="logic">{{cite web|first=Gordon H.|last=Hanson|title=The Economic Logic of Illegal Immigration. Report to the Council on Foreign Relations|work=Council on Foreign Relations (CSR No. 26)|date=April 2007|url=http://www.cfr.org/content/publications/attachments/ImmigrationCSR26.pdf|accessdate=2009-12-11}}</ref> This model also assumes that illegal workers tend to add to, and compete with, the receiving nation's pool of unskilled laborers.  Illegal workers in this model find employment by accepting lower wages than native-born workers, sometimes below the [[minimum wage]] and "off-the-books".  Economist [[George Borjas]] supports aspects of this model, calculating that real wages of US workers without a high school degree declined by 9% from 1980–2000 due to competition from illegal immigrant workers. <ref>{{cite journal|first=George|last=Borjas|title=The Labor Demand Curve is Downward Sloping: Reexamining the Impact of Immigration on the Labor Market|work=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=118|number=4|pages=1335-1374|date=2003|url=http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/118/4/1335.abstract?sid=5feab49f-e35b-4d0f-b20f-ca6280580e35|accessdate=2009-12-11}}</ref> . 

Large scale economic evidence supports neoclassical theory, as may be seen in the long-term correlation of relative wages/unemployment and illegal immigration from Mexico to the US. However, immigration scholars such as Gordon Hanson and [[Douglas Massey]] have criticized the model for being oversimplified and not accounting for contradictory evidence, such as low net illegal immigration from Mexico to the US before the 1980s despite significant economic disparity. <ref name="logic"/> Numerous refinements have been suggested to account for other factors, as seen below.  . 

====Trade liberalization====. 
In recent years, developing states are pursuing the benefits of [[globalization]] by joining decline to '''liberalize trade'''.  But rapid opening of domestic markets may lead to displacement of large numbers of agricultural or unskilled workers, who are more likely to seek employment and a higher quality of life by illegal emigration.  This is a frequently cited argument to explain how the [[North American Free Trade Association]] may have impoverished Mexican farmers who were unable to compete with the higher productivity of US subsidized agriculture, especially for corn.  NAFTA may have also unexpectedly raised educational requirements for industrial jobs in Mexico, since the new ''[[maquiladora]]s'' produced export products requiring skills and education that many unskilled workers did not have. <ref name="pietro">Giorgio di Pietro. Trade, Legal, and Illegal Immigration. University of Westminster. Available at http://www.epriee.ncl.ac.uk/dipietro.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2012}} Accessed December 11, 2009</ref>{{dubious|date=March 2012}} . 

====Structural demand in developed states====. 
Douglas Massey argues that a bifurcating labor market in developed nations creates a '''structural demand''' for unskilled immigrant labor to fill undesirable jobs that native-born citizens do not seek, ''regardless of wages''. <ref name="massey">{{cite book|first1=Douglas|last1=Massey|first2=Jorge|last2=Durand|first3=Nolan J.|last3=Malone|title=Beyond Smoke and Mirrors: Mexican Immigration in an Era of Economic Integration|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation|location=New York|year=2003}}</ref> He postulates that [[postindustrial]] economies have a widening gap between well-paying, white-collar jobs that require ever higher levels of education ("human capital"), for which native-born citizens and legal immigrants can qualify, and bottom-tier jobs that are [[Social stigma|stigma]]tized and require no education. These "underclass" jobs include harvesting crops, unskilled labor in landscaping and construction, house-cleaning, and maid and busboy work in hotels and restaurants, all of which have a disproportionate number of illegal workers.  . 

Since the decline of middle-class [[blue-collar]] jobs in manufacturing and industry, younger native-born generations have acquired higher education.  The majority of new blue-collar jobs qualify as Massey's "underclass" work, and suffer from unreliability, subservient roles, and, critically, a lack of potential for advancement. Entry-level white-collar and service jobs offer advancement opportunities for native-born and legal immigrant workers.  . 

In a developed country like the US, only 12% of the labor force has less than a high school education. Illegal immigrants have much lower levels of education (about 70% of illegal workers in the US from Mexico lack a high school degree). <ref name="logic"/>  Even "underclass" jobs have much higher relative wages than those in home countries.  Since illegal immigrants often anticipate working only temporarily in the destination country, the lack of opportunity for advancement is less of a problem.  Evidence for this can be seen in one Pew Hispanic Center poll of over 3,000 illegal immigrants from Mexico in the US, which found that 79% would voluntarily join a [[temporary worker]] program that allowed them to work legally for several years but then required them to leave. <ref name="pew survey">{{cite web|first=Roberto|last=Suro|title=Survey of Mexican Migrants, Part One: Attitudes about Immigration and Major
Demographic Characteristics|work=Pew Hispanic Center|date=March 2, 2005|url=http://pewhispanic.org/files/reports/41.pdf|accessdate=2009-12-11}}</ref> . 

The structural demand theory posits that willingness to work undesirable jobs is what gives illegal immigrants their employment. <ref name="Massey") Evidence for this may be seen in the average wages of illegal day laborers in California, between $10 and $12 per hour in a 2005 study, was higher than many entry-level white collar work or service jobs. <ref>{{cite web|first1=Abel|last1=Valenzuela, Jr.|first2=Nik|last2=Theodore|first3=Edwin|last3=Meléndez|first4=Ana Luz|last4=Gonzalez|title=On the Corner: Day Labor in the US|work=UCLA Center for the Study of Urban Poverty|date=January 2006|accessdate=2009-12-11|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/issr/csup/uploaded_files/Natl_DayLabor-On_the_Corner1.pdf}}</ref>
Structural demand theory argues that cases like this show that there is no direct competition between unskilled illegal immigrants and native-born workers.  This is the concept that illegal immigrants "take jobs that no one else wants".  Massey argues that this has certain implications for policy, as it may refute claims that illegal immigrants are "lowering wages" or stealing jobs from native-born workers. <ref name="massey"/> . 

====Poverty====. 
While economic models do look at relative wealth and income between home and destination countries, they do not necessarily imply that illegal migrants are always impoverished by standards of the home country.  The poorest classes in a developing country may lack the resources needed to mount an attempt to cross illegally, or the connections to friends or family already in the destination country.  Studies from the Pew Hispanic Center have shown that the education and wage levels of illegal Mexican immigrants in the US are around the median for Mexico, and that having family who have emigrated or being from a community with many emigrants is a much better predictor of one's choice to emigrate. <ref name="pew survey"/> . 

Other examples do show that increases in poverty, especially when associated with immediate crises, can increase the likelihood of illegal migration.  The [[1994 economic crisis in Mexico]], subsequent to the start of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) was associated with widespread poverty and a lower valuation for the peso relative to the dollar. <ref name="pietro"/> It also marked the start of a massive swell in Mexican emigration, in which net illegal migration to the US increased every year from the mid-1990s until the mid 2000s.  . 

There are also examples where [[natural disasters]] and [[overpopulation]] can amplify [[poverty]]-driven migration flows. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=59616|title=ETHIOPIA: High population growth could slow development - gov't|date=July 11, 2006|accessdate=2012-03-04|work=IRIN}}</ref> . 

===Overpopulation===. 
[[Population growth]] that exceeds the [[carrying capacity]] of an area or environment results in [[overpopulation]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.donellameadows.org/archives/poverty-causes-population-growth-causes-poverty|title=Poverty Causes Population Growth Causes Poverty|first=Donella|last=Meadows|date=1986|work=Donella Meadows Institute|accessdate=2012-03-04}}</ref> Spikes in human population can cause problems such as [[pollution]], [[water crisis]],<ref>{{cite news|first=Alex|last=Kirby|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1234244.stm|title=World warned on water refugees|date=March 21,2001|accessdate=2012-03-04|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earth-policy.org/Alerts/Alert4.htm|title=Plan B Updates: Population Growth Sentencing Millions to Hydrological Poverty|first=Lester R.|last=Brown|date=June 21, 2000|accessdate=2012-03-04|work=Earth Policy Institute}}</ref> and [[poverty]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/sd/WPdirect/WPre0087.htm|title=Population and Poverty: the Policy Issues, Part 1|first=Geoffrey|last=McNicoll|date=January 1999|accessdate=2012-03-04|work=Sustainable Development Department, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations}}

In 2000, the [[United Nations]] estimated that the world's population was growing at the rate of 1.14% (or about 75 million people) per year. According to data from the CIA's [[The World Factbook|World Factbook]], the world human population currently increases by 145 every minute. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html|title=People and Society:WORLD:Population growth rate|accessdate=2012-03-04|work=The World Factbook}}</ref> The United States [[Census Bureau]] issued a revised forecast for world population that increased its projection for the year 2050 to above 9.4 billion people, up from 9.1 billion people.

===Family reunification===. 
Some illegal immigrants seek to live with loved ones, such as a spouse or other family members. <ref name="washpost1">{{cite news|first=N.

This may force their family members to enter illegally to reunify. From studying Mexican migration patterns, Douglas Massey finds that the likelihood of a Mexican national to emigrate illegally to the US increases dramatically if they have one or more family members already residing in the United States, legally or illegally. <ref name="massey"/> . 

Due to inability to marry, same-sex couples in which one member has an expiring visa may face an "unpalatable choice between leaving and living with the person they love in violation of U.S. immigration laws". <ref name="hrw1">{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/us0506/index.htm|title=Family, Unvalued Discrimination, Denial, and the Fate of Binational Same-Sex Couples under U.S. Law|work=Human Rights Watch|date=May 2, 2006|quote=Faced with the unpalatable choice between leaving and living with the person they love in violation of U.S. immigration laws, foreign-born partners may become undocumented—staying after their visa expires.|accessdate=2012-03-04}}</ref> . 

===Wars and asylum===. 
Unauthorized immigration may be prompted by the desire to escape civil war or [[Political repression|repression]] in the country of origin. Non-economic push factors include [[persecution]] (religious and otherwise), frequent [[physical abuse|abuse]], [[bullying]], [[oppression]], and [[genocide]], and risks to civilians during [[List of wars|war]]. Political motives traditionally motivate [[refugee]] flows – to escape [[dictatorship]] for instance.  . 

The status of "unauthorized immigrant" may coincide with or be replaced by the status of "[[asylum seeker]]" for emigrants who have escaped a war or repression and have unlawfully crossed into another state.  If they are recognized as "legitimate" asylees by the destination state, they will then gain status.  However, there may be numerous potential asylees in a destination state who are unwilling to apply or have been denied asylum status, and hence are categorized as "unathorized immigrants" and may be subject to punishment or deportation. However,  Article 31 of the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] prohibits the Contracting States from imposing penalties on refugees for their illegal enter or presence, who come directly from a territory where their life or freedom are threatened. 
There are numerous cases of mass emigration from poor or war-stricken states.  These include examples from Africa<ref>{{cite news|first=Lucy|last=Fleming|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5383080.stm|title=Gambia – new front in migrant trade|work=BBC News|date=October 10, 2006|accessdate=2012-03-04}}</ref>, Colombia, and El Salvador.  . 

After decades of armed conflict, roughly one of every 10 Colombians now lives abroad. <ref name="mis1">{{cite web |url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=344 |title=Colombia: In the Crossfire| accessdate=2007-01-22 |author= Myriam Bérubé |date=November 2005|publisher=Migration Policy Institute}}</ref>
For example, Colombians emigrating to Spain have "grown exponentially, from a little over 7,000 in 1993 to more than 80,000 in 2002 and 244,000 in 2003."<ref name="imdiversity">{{cite web|first=Pilar|last=Marrero|url=http://www.imdiversity.com/Villages/Hispanic/world_international/pns_immigration_shift_1204.asp|title=Immigration Shift: Many Latin Americans Choosing Spain Over U.S.|work=IMDiversity.com|date=December 9, 2004|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref>
Also, figures from the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] indicate that [[Colombia]] is the fourth-leading source country of unauthorized [[immigration to the United States]]. According to its [[estimates]], the number of [[unauthorized]] Colombian residents in the United States almost tripled from 51,000 in 1990 to 141,000 in 2000. <ref name=ins>{{cite web|work=Office of Policy and Planning U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service|url=http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/statistics/publications/Ill_Report_1211.pdf|title=Estimates of the unauthorized immigrant population residing in the United States: 1990 to 2000|accessdate=2012-03-04}}</ref> According to the US Census Bureau, the number of [[authorized]] Colombian immigrants in the United States in 2000{{Citation needed|reason=Is this not the estimated figure for 2006?

[[El Salvador]] is another country which experienced substantial emigration as a result of civil war and repression. The largest per-capita source of immigrants to the United States comes from El Salvador. Up to a third of the world's Salvadoran-born population lives outside the country, mostly in the United States.{{cite needed|date=March 2012}} . 

==Problems==. 
The problems with illegal immigration can be divided into dangers faced by illegal immigrants and problems faced by the host or receiving country.  Illegal immigrants may expose themselves and citizens of the nations they encroach upon to dangers while engaged in [[illegal entry]] into another country. Aside from the possibility that they may be intercepted and deported, some considerably more dangerous outcomes have been known to result from their activity. As an example, unauthorized immigrants may be [[Trafficking in human beings|trafficked]] for exploitation including [[Sexual slavery|sexual exploitation]] and some illegal immigrants are involved in broader criminal activity.  . 

===Slavery===. 
After the end of the legal international [[slave trade]] by the European nations and the United States in the early 19th century, the illegal importation of [[slave]]s has continued, albeit at much reduced levels. Although not as common as in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America, some women are undoubtedly smuggled into the United States and Canada. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2004/09/23_16691.shtml|title=Modern slavery thriving in the U.S.|first=Janet|last=Gilmore|date=September 23, 2004|work=UC Berkeley News|accessdate=2012-03-04}}</ref> . 

People have been kidnapped or tricked into slavery to work as laborers, for example in factories. Those trafficked in this manner often face additional barriers to escaping slavery, since their status as illegal immigrants makes it difficult for them to gain access to help or services. For example [[Burma|Burmese]] women trafficked into Thailand and forced to work in factories or as prostitutes may not speak the language and may be vulnerable to abuse by police due to their illegal immigrant status. <ref>{{cite book

===Death===. 
Each year there are several hundred illegal [[Immigrant deaths along the U.S.-Mexico border]]. <ref>United States Government Accounting Office.

==Methods==. 
===Border crossing===. 
[[Image:Office of CBP Air and Marine helicopter and boats.jpg|thumb|Border control at sea by the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]]]]
[[Image:HMRC Vigilant BB.jpg|thumb|right|HMC Vigilant, one of several customs cutters of the UKBA, capable of speeds up to 26 knots departing [[Portsmouth Naval Base]].]]
Immigrants from nations that do not have automatic visa agreements, or who would not otherwise qualify for a visa, often cross the borders illegally in some areas like the [[United States–Mexico border]], the Mona Channel between the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], [[Fuerteventura]], and the [[Strait of Otranto]]. Because these methods are illegal, they are often dangerous. Would-be immigrants have been known to suffocate in [[shipping container]]s,<ref>{{Cite news|work=CBC News|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2000/01/10/migrants000110.html|title=Three illegal migrants die in shipping container|date=November 11, 2000|accessdate=2007-10-03}}</ref> [[boxcar]]s,<ref>{{cite web|work=Siskind Susser Bland|url=http://www.visalaw.com/98aug/33aug98.html|title=At least 52 immigrants die of heat crossing from Mexico|accessdate=2007-10-03}}</ref> and trucks,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.people.com.cn/english/200103/06/eng20010306_64193.html|work=People's Dailt Online|date=March 06, 2001|title=Ninth on Trial in Dutch Court for Murder and Illegal Immigration|accessdate=2012-03-04}}</ref> sink in [[shipwreck]]s caused by unseaworthy vessels, die of [[dehydration]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=21975|title=Illegal Immigration: An American Tragedy|first=Allan J.|last=Ashinoff|date=March 12, 2007|accessdate=2012-03-04}}</ref> or [[Hypothermia|exposure]] during long walks without water. An official estimate puts the number of people who died in illegal crossings across the U.S.-Mexican border between 1998 and 2004 at 1,954 (see [[immigrant deaths along the U.S.-Mexico border]]).  . 

[[Human smuggling]] is the practice of intermediaries aiding illegal immigrants in crossing over international borders in financial gain, often in large groups. Human smuggling differs from, but is sometimes associated with, [[human trafficking]]. A human smuggler will facilitate [[illegal entry]] into a country for a fee, but on arrival at their destination, the smuggled person is usually free. Trafficking involves a process of using physical force, [[fraud]], or [[deception]] to obtain and transport people.  . 

Types of notorious human smugglers include [[Snakehead (gang)|Snakehead]] [[gang]]s present in [[mainland China]] (especially in [[Fujian]]) that smuggle laborers into [[Pacific Rim]] nations (making [[Chinatown]]s frequent centers of illegal immigration) and "coyotes", who smuggle illegal immigrants to the [[Southwestern United States]] and have been known to abuse or even kill their passengers. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/mexico/tijuana/20060723-9999-1m23killed.html|title=Immigrant found slain in Grant Hill house|first=Lola|last=Sherman
|work=San Diego Union-Tribune|date=July 23, 2006|accessdate=2012-03-04}}</ref> Sometimes immigrants are abandoned by their human traffickers if there are difficulties, often dying in the process. Others may be victims of intentional killing.  . 

===Overstaying a visa===. 
Many illegal immigrants are migrants who originally arrive in a country lawfully but overstay their authorized residence (overstaying a [[visa (document)|visa]]). <ref name="iom5">{{cite web|url=http://cis.org/Illegal|title=Illegal Immigration|accessdate=2012-03-04|work=Center for Immigration Studies}}</ref><ref>[http://www.workpermit.com/news/2005_10_24/us/immigrants_overstay_visas_us.htm]</ref> For example, most of the estimated 200,000 illegal immigrants in Canada (perhaps as high as 500,000) are refugee claimants whose refugee applications were rejected but who have not yet been expelled from the country. <ref>{{cite news | author = Marina Jimenez | url = http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v4/sub/MarketingPage?user_URL=http://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2Fstory%2FLAC.20031115.UILLE15%2FTPStory%2F%3Fquery%3DCanada%2527s%2Bunderground%2Beconomy%2B&ord=1155738419213&brand=theglobeandmail&force_login=true| title = 200,000 illegal immigrants toiling in Canada's underground economy | work=Globe and Mail| date= 2003-11-15 | location=Toronto}}</ref> . 

A related way of becoming an unathorized immigrant is through bureaucratic means. For example, persons can be allowed to remain in a country or be protected from expulsion because they need special pension for a medical condition,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} deep love for a native,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} or even to avoid being tried for a crime in their native country,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} without being able to regularize their situation and obtain a work and/or residency permit, let alone [[naturalization]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Hence, categories of people being neither "unauthorized" immigrants nor local citizens are created, living in a judicial "no man's land".  . 

Another example is formed by children of foreigners born in countries observing ''[[jus soli]]'' ("right of territory"), such as was the case in France until 1994{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} and in Ireland until 2005. <ref name="citizensinformation.ie">http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/moving-country/irish-citizenship/irish_citizenship_through_birth_or_descent</ref> In these countries, it was possible to obtain French or Irish nationality (respectively) solely by being born in France before 1994 or in Ireland before 2005<ref name="citizensinformation.ie"/>  (respectively). At present, a French born child of foreign parents does not automatically obtain French nationality until residency duration conditions are met{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. Since 1 January 2005, a child born in Ireland does not automatically acquire Irish nationality unless certain conditions are met. <ref name="citizensinformation.ie"/> . 

==Legal and political status==.

Many countries have had or currently have laws restricting immigration for economic or [[nationalism|nationalistic]] political reasons. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373]] concerning [[counter-terrorism]], enacted in October 2001, requested of UN member states to restrict immigration laws. Whether a person is permitted to stay in a country legally may be decided by [[Emergency Quota Act|quota]]s or point systems or may be based on considerations such as family ties (marriage, elderly mother, etc.). Exceptions relative to [[political refugee]]s or to sick people are also common. Immigrants who do not participate in these legal proceedings or who are denied permission under them and still enter or stay in the country are illegal immigrants, as well as people born on national territory (henceforth not "immigrants") but who have not obtained nationality of their birthplace and have no legal title of residency. <ref>http://149.101.23.2/graphics/publicaffairs/factsheets/948.htm</ref> . 

Most countries have laws requiring workers to have proper documentation, often intended to prevent or minimize the employment of unauthorized immigrants. However the penalties against employers are often small and the acceptable identification requirements vague and ill-defined as well as being seldom checked or enforced, making it easy for employers to hire unauthorized labor. Unauthorized immigrants are especially popular with many employers because they can pay less than the legal [[minimum wage]] or have unsafe working conditions, secure in the knowledge that few unauthorized workers will report the abuse to the authorities. Often the minimum wages in one country can be several times the prevailing wage in the unauthorized immigrant's country, making even these jobs attractive to the unauthorized worker.{{Citation needed|reason=Aug 2010|date=August 2010}} . 

In response to the outcry following popular knowledge of [[the Holocaust]], the newly-established [[United Nations]] held an international conference on [[refugees]], where it was decided that refugees (legally defined to be people who are persecuted in their original country and then enter another country seeking safety) should be exempted from immigration laws. <ref>http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/o_c_ref.htm</ref> It is, however, up to the countries involved to decide if a particular immigrant is a refugee or not, and hence whether they are subject to the immigration controls.  . 

The right to [[freedom of movement]] of an individual within national borders is often contained within the [[constitution]] or in a country's [[human rights]] legislation but these rights are restricted to [[citizen]]s and exclude all others. Some argue that the freedom of movement both within and between countries is a basic human right and that [[nationalism]] and immigration policies of state governments violate this human right that those same governments recognize within their own borders. According to the article 13 on the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], fundamental human rights are violated when citizens are forbidden to leave their country. However, immigrants are not assured the right to enter a country, that right is given at the host country's discretion.[citation] . 

Since illegal immigrants without proper legal status have no valid identification documents such as [[identity card]]s, they may have reduced or no access to [[public health]] systems, proper housing, [[education]] and [[bank]]s. This lack of access may result in the creation or expansion of illegal underground forgery to provide this documentation. <ref>http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=98736</ref> . 

When the authorities are overwhelmed in their efforts to stop "illegal" immigration, they have historically provided [[amnesty]]. Amnesties waive the "subject to deportation" clause associated with illegal aliens.  . 

==By country or region==. 
===Angola===. 
In 2007 around 44,000 Congolese were forced to leave [[Angola]]. <ref>[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L06594708.htm Angolan soldiers rape, beat Congolese migrants – group]</ref> Since 2004, more than 400,000 illegal immigrants, almost all from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], have been expelled from Angola. <ref>[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=68&art_id=qw1142436241852B252 IOL: Angola warns against illegal immigration]</ref><ref>[http://www.monuc.org/news.aspx?newsID=17514 Angola expels thousands of Congolese]</ref> . 

===Australia===. 
Official government sources put the number of visa overstayers in Australia at approximately 50,000. This has been the official number of illegal immigrants for about 25 years and is considered to be low. Other sources have placed it at up to 100,000, but no detailed study has been completed to quantify this number, which could be significantly higher.  . 

===Bhutan===. 
[[Immigration in Bhutan]] by Nepalese settlers ([[Lhotshampa]]) began slowly towards the end of the 19th century. 
The government passed the [[Bhutanese Citizenship Act 1985]] to clarify and try to enforce the [[Bhutanese Citizenship Act 1958]] to control the flood of illegal immigration. Those individuals who could not provide proof of residency prior to 1958 were adjudged to be illegal immigrants. In 1991 and 1992, [[Bhutan]] expelled roughly 139,110 ethnic [[Nepal]]is, most of whom have been living in seven refugee camps in eastern Nepal ever since. The United States has offered to resettle 60,000 of the 107,000 Bhutanese refugees of Nepalese origin now living in U.N. refugee camps in Nepal. The Bhutanese government, even today, has not been able to sort the problem of giving citizenship to those people who are married to Bhutanese, even though they have been in the country for 40 years. <ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7082586.stm | title = Bhutan refugees are 'intimidated' | author = Bhaumik, Subir | date = November 7, 2007 | work = BBC News | accessdate = 2008-09-19}}</ref> . 

===Brazil===. 
{{Main|Illegal immigration in Brazil}}
[[File:Saopaulo paulista.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aerial view of [[São Paulo]], where most illegal immigrants in Brazil live.]]
Brazil has long been part of international migration routes. In 2009, the government estimated the number of undocumented immigrants at about 200,000 people; a [[Catholic]] charity working with immigrants said there were 600,000 unauthorized immigrants (75,000 of which from [[Bolivia]]). That same year, the [[Brazilian Parliament]] approved an amnesty, opening a six-month window for all foreigners to seek legalization irrespective of their previous standing before the law. Brazil had last legalized all immigrants in 1998; bilateral deals, one of which promoted the legalization of all reciprocal immigrants with Bolivia to date, signed in 2005, are also common. <ref name="Globo">[http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Brasil/0,,MUL365307-5598,00.html Globo.com]</ref> . 

Unauthorized immigrants in Brazil enjoy the same legal privileges as native Brazilians regarding access to social services such as [[public education]] and the [[Sistema Único de Saúde|Brazilian public healthcare system]]. <ref name="Globo"/> Most unauthorized immigrants in Brazil come from Bolivia, [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], China (mainly from [[Fujian]]), [[North Korea]] and [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. A [[Polícia Federal|Federal Police]] operation investigated Chinese immigrants who traveled through six countries before arriving in [[São Paulo]] to work under substandard conditions in the [[textile industry]]. <ref>[http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Brasil/0,,MUL1163864-5598,00-PF+FAZ+OPERACAO+CONTRA+IMIGRACAO+ILEGAL+DE+CHINESES+EM+ESTADOS.html Globo.com – PF faz operação contra imigração ilegal de chineses em 3 estados]</ref> . 

After signing the 2009 amnesty bill into law, [[President Lula]] said, in a speech, that "repression and intolerance against immigrants will not solve the problems caused by [[2008 economic crisis|the economic crisis]]", thereby also harshly criticizing the "policy of discrimination and prejudice" against immigrants in developed nations.  . 

An October 2009 piece from [[O Globo]], quoting a [[UNDP]] study, estimates the number of unauthorized immigrants at 0.7 million,<ref>[http://www.hart-brasilientexte.de/2009/10/11/fremdenfeindlichkeit-in-brasilien-xenofobia-verde-amarela-43-prozent-der-brasilianer-fur-einwanderungsverbot-bzw-begrenzung-laut-neuer-uno-studie-das-brasilien-offen-gegenuber-auslandern-is/]</ref> and points out to a recent wave of xenophobia among the general populace. <ref>[http://clippingmp.planejamento.gov.br/cadastros/noticias/2009/10/11/no-brasil-43-querem-proibir-a-imigracao Ministério do Planejamento]</ref> .

Many reports from local Greek islands, near the Turkish coast indicate that Turks equip migrants with boats and knives and tell them to cut the boat when they reach Greek waters. Greek authorities are then forced to deal with the influx of thousands of illegal immigrants under EU rules.

====France====. 
{{Main|Illegal immigration in France}}
In [[France]], helping an unathorized immigrant (providing shelter, for example) is prohibited by a law passed on December 27, 1994. <ref>[http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1995/06/ROCHU/1546]</ref> The law was heavily criticized by [[non-governmental organization]]s such as [[Cimade]] and [[GISTI]], left-wing political parties such as the [[Greens (France)|Greens]] and the [[French Communist Party]], and [[trade-union]]s such as the magistrates' ''[[Syndicat de la magistrature]]''.  . 

The linguistic differentiations between anglophone and francophone rhetoric is important when considering the topic of French illegal immigration. In French, the term "irrégulière" is used (literally “irregular”), whereas in English, the term more often used is "illegal." Often, instead of referring to someone's irregular immigrant status, the colloquial term used is "sans papiers" (literally "without papers"), referring to the fact that irregular immigrants to not possess papers from the French government allowing them to stay in [[France]]. <ref>[http://www.denverpost.com/rodriguez/ci_3668842 "Illegal" as a Noun Breaks Law of Reason]</ref><ref>[http://www.gisti.org/doc/publications/2006/sans-papiers/index.html], "GISTI – Sans-papiers Mais Pas Sans Droits (4ème éd.)."</ref> . 

It is important to distinguish illegal immigrants from other forms of immigrants and residents in France. Some immigrants to France are asylum-seekers, and once granted asylum, they are no longer illegal/irregular, though they are immigrants. There are also children who are born to immigrants in France, who are not immigrants themselves, but they are still considered foreigners by the French national government. One does not merely need to be a foreign immigrant in order to be a foreigner in France. <ref>[http://www.migrationinformation.org/feature/display.cfm?ID=266], "The Challenge of French Diversity."</ref> . 

[[French citizenship]] is based in the idea of political unity; therefore, French citizenship may be more accessible than other EU countries, such as Germany. However, there is also the strong feeling among French citizens that those non-native people who gain French citizenship should also conform to the cultural aspects of French life. <ref>Brubaker, Rogers. "Immigration, Citizenship, and the Nation-State in France and Germany." The Citizenship Debates: a Reader. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota, 1998. </ref> . 

French law prohibits anyone from assisting or trying to assist "the entry, movement, or irregular stay of a foreigner in France." One found guilty of these acts can be imprisoned for up to five years and fined €30,000.  There are also quotas for the number of arrests that should be made in such cases: 5,000 arrests for 2009 and 5,500 arrests for 2011. <ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29899231/ns/world_news-europe/t/helping-illegal-immigrants-crime-france/], "Helping Illegal Immigrants a Crime in France"</ref> . 

France has an Immigration Ministry (L'immigration, l'intégration, l'asile et le développement solidaire) which begun functioning in 2007 under President Sarkozy. The goal of these quotas and laws put forth by the government is to combat smugglers who profit financially from moving immigrants into, through, and out of France, according to the Immigration Minister, Eric Besson. <ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29899231/ns/world_news-europe/t/helping-illegal-immigrants-crime-france/], "Helping Illegal Immigrants a Crime in France"</ref><ref>[http://www.migrationinformation.org/feature/display.cfm?ID=266], "The Challenge of French Diversity."</ref> . 

[[Calais]] is an important site when considering illegal immigrants in France. This is where many move go to try  to cross the English [[Channel]] towards [[Great Britain]], the goal for many of them, as it is believed to be  easier to gain asylum or refugee status there. <ref>[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1947471,00.html], "Illegal Immigration in France: Calais Refugees – TIME."</ref> In Calais, when trying to pass through customs towards Great Britain, truck drivers can be fined up to €2,500 if illegal immigrants are found on board their truck when it is searched. <ref>[http://www.france24.com/en/20081128-castaways-illegal-immigration-france], "The Castaways of Illegal Immigration."</ref> . 

There is an area of Calais known as "the Jungle", which houses many of the ones who are waiting to get into Great Britain. There was a police raid here in September 2009, which was seen as a political move by authorities to show their efforts in public to control illegal immigration. <ref>[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1947471,00.html], "Illegal Immigration in France: Calais Refugees – TIME."</ref> . 

Many non-governmental organizations, such as Secours Catholique and the [[Red Cross]] are involved in the situation as well.  hese NGOs provide food, showers, and shelter to sans papiers who gather waiting to cross the Channel.  In 2002, then Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy closed a Red Cross shelter in the Calais suburb of Sangette that housed thousands of sans papiers in an effort to discourage them from trying to cross the border.  These immigrants simply moved to other parts of the Calais region. <ref>[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1947471,00.html], "Illegal Immigration in France: Calais Refugees – TIME."</ref> . 

Philippe Lefilleul, a member of Secours Cotholique, stated that aid workers from these NGOs do not condone the illegal immigration of people to France, but they feel that it is their "duty as fellow human beings and as Christians" to help them. <ref>[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1947471,00.html], "Illegal Immigration in France: Calais Refugees – TIME."</ref> . 

The French film "Welcome" is a portrayal of a sans papiers young man trying to cross the English Channel from Calais and his interactions with a swimming instructor in Calais. It was a controversial film when it was released because it moves a very sensitive political and social topic into a very important French cultural venu: —film.  Other French films that address the topic of French immigration, especially illegal immigration, are "Entre les murs" and "La Haine", which address cultural and political situations surrounding immigration in Parisian suburbs and the country at large. <ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/08/france-welcome-film-immigration], "France Hails Film Drama of Refugee's Desperate Swim across the Channel"</ref> .

[[Image:Bangladeshi.jpg|thumb|ABVP against Bangladeshi illegals]] . 

It is estimated that several million illegal immigrants live in India. Precise figures are not available, but the numbers run from anywhere from a few hundred thousand to 20 million. Especially in Eastern India, these are mainly economic migrants from Bangladesh.  . 

India is constructing barriers on its eastern borders to combat the surge of migrants.  The [[Indo-Bangladeshi barrier]] is 4,000 km (2,500 mi) long. Presently, India is constructing a fence along the border to restrict illegal traffic from [[Bangladesh]]. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/4653810.stm Villagers left in limbo by border fence]</ref> This obstruction will virtually isolate Bangladesh from India. The barrier's plan is based on the designs of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] and will be 3.6 m (11.8 ft) high. The stated aim of the fence is to stop infiltration of terrorists, prevent smuggling, and end illegal immigration from Bangladesh. <ref>[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1170359860662&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/Printer The good fences epidemic]</ref><ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article782933.ece India builds a 2,500-mile barrier to rival the Great Wall of China]</ref> . 

===Iran===. 
{{Wikinews|46 illegal Afghan immigrants suffocate in truck in Pakistan}}
Since late April 2007, the [[Iran]]ian government has forcibly deported back to [[Afghanistan]] mostly unregistered (and some registered) [[Afghans in Iran|Afghans living and working in Iran]] at a rate between 250,000 and 300,000 per year. The forceful evictions of the refugees, who lived in Iran and Pakistan for nearly three decades, are part of the two countries' larger plans to repatriate all Afghan refugees within a few years. Iran says that it will send 1,000,000 by next March, and Pakistan announced that all 2,400,000 Afghan refugees, most living in camps, must return home by 2009. Experts{{Who|date=May 2010}} say it will be "disastrous" for Afghanistan. <ref>[http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/article.aspx?id=834 Iranian Deportations Raise Fears of Humanitarian Crisis in Afghanistan]</ref><ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0214/p06s02-wosc.html To root out Taliban, Pakistan to expel 2.4 million Afghans]</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6705329.stm Expelled from Iran – refugee misery]</ref> .

{{Wikinews|Shipwreck off coast of Libya; hundreds of African migrants feared dead}}
[[Libya]] is home to a large illegal [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n population which numbers as much as 2,000,000. <ref>[http://www.pr-inside.com/libya-asserts-its-right-to-deport-r394573.htm Libya asserts its right to deport 2 million illegal immigrants in face of criticism]</ref> The mass expulsion plan to summarily deport all undocumented foreigners was announced by Libyan leader Colonel [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] in January 2008.

===Malaysia===. 
{{Main|Illegal immigrants in Malaysia}}
There are an estimated 800,000 illegal immigrants in [[Malaysia]]. <ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1832645.cms Indians among illegal immigrants rounded up in Malaysia]</ref> In January 2009, Malaysia banned the hiring of foreign workers in factories, stores and restaurants to protect its citizens from mass unemployment amid the [[late 2000s recession]]. <ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2009/01/20091228418535985.html Malaysia bans foreign labourers], Al Jazeera English, January 22, 2009</ref> An ethnic [[Malaysian Indian|Indian Malaysian]] was recently sentenced to whipping and 10 months in prison for hiring six illegal immigrants at his restaurant. "I think that after this, Malaysian employers will be afraid to take in foreign workers (without work permits). They will think twice", said immigration department prosecutor Azlan Abdul Latiff. "This is the first case where an employer is being sentenced to caning", he said. Illegal immigrants also face [[caning]] before being deported. <ref>[http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/content/view/10390/2/ Malaysian man receives unusually harsh punishment for employing illegals]</ref> . 

===Mexico===. 
In the first six months of 2005 alone, more than 120,000 people from [[Central America]] have been deported to their countries of origin. This is a significantly higher rate than in 2002, when for the entire year, only 130,000 people were deported [http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/08/24/018n3pol.php]. Another important group of people are those of [[Han Chinese]] origin, who pay about $5,500 to smugglers to be taken to Mexico from [[Hong Kong]]. It is estimated that 2.4% of rejections for work permits in Mexico correspond to Chinese citizens [http://www.cimacnoticias.com/noticias/01dic/01122403.html].  . 

Many women from [[Eastern Europe]], Asia, and [[Central America|Central]] and South America are also offered jobs at [[table dance]] establishments in large cities throughout the country causing the [[National Institute of Migration]] (INM) in Mexico to raid [[strip clubs]] and deport foreigners who work without the proper documentation [http://www.tvazteca.com/hechos/archivos2/2004/10/102327.shtml]. In 2004, the INM deported 188,000 people at a cost of US$10 million [http://www.migracion.gob.mx/paginas/entrevistas/entrevista10feb2004.htm]. 
Illegal immigration of Cubans through [[Cancún]] tripled from 2004 to 2006. 
[http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/415621.html] . 

In September 2007, Mexican President Calderón harshly criticized the United States government for the crackdown on illegal immigrants, saying it has led to the persecution of immigrant workers without visas. "I have said that Mexico does not stop at its border, that wherever there is a Mexican, there is Mexico", he said. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/03/world/americas/03mexico.html?_r=1&oref=slogin Mexican President Assails U.S. Measures on Migrants], New York Times, September 3, 2007</ref> . 

In October 2008, Mexico tightened its immigration rules and agreed to deport [[Cubans]] who use the country as an entry point to the US. It also criticized US policy that generally allows Cubans who reach US territory to stay. Cuban Foreign Minister said the Cuban-Mexican agreement would lead to "the immense majority of Cubans being repatriated."<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/news/americas/story/733625.html Mexico to deport Cubans heading illegally to US], MiamiHerald.com, October 22, 2008</ref> . 

===Nepal===. 
In 2008, [[Nepal]]'s [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)|Maoist]]-led government has initiated a major crackdown against Tibetan exiles with the aim to deport to [[People's Republic of China|China]] all [[Tibetans]] living illegally in the country. Tibetans started pouring in Nepal after a failed anti-Chinese [[1959 Tibetan uprising|uprising in Tibet]] in 1959. <ref>[http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=41818 NEPAL: Tibetans Warned of Deportation to China]. </ref> . 

===Pakistan===. 
{{Main|Immigration to Pakistan#Illegal immigration}} . 

===Russia===. 
Russia experiences a constant flow of immigration. On average, 200,000 legal immigrants enter the country every year; about half are ethnic [[Russians]] from other republics of the former Soviet Union. In addition, there are an estimated 10–12 million illegal immigrants in the country. <ref>{{cite web|title=Russia cracking down on illegal migrants|work=International Herald Tribune|date=January 15, 2007|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/15/news/migrate.php|accessdate =}}</ref> There has been a significant influx of ethnic [[Georgians]], [[Armenians]], [[Azerbaijanis]], [[Tājik people|Tajiks]], and [[Uzbeks]] into big Russian cities in recent years, which has been viewed very unfavorably by many citizens and contributed to [[Russian nationalism|nationalist]] sentiments. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2452989.stm Moscow to deport Tajiks by air]</ref><ref>[http://english.pravda.ru/news/hotspots/06-10-2006/84915-Georgia_Russia-0 Russian police determined to oust Georgians from Moscow]</ref><ref>[http://russiatoday.ru/news/news/2622 Russian nationalists protest against illegal immigration in Irkutsk]</ref> . 

Many immigrant ethnic groups have much higher birth rates than native Russians, further shifting the balance. Some [[Chinese people|Chinese]] flee the overpopulation and birth control regulations of their home country and settle in the [[Russian Far East|Far East]] and in southern [[Siberia]]. Russia's main Pacific port and naval base of [[Vladivostok]], once closed to foreigners, today is bristling with Chinese markets, restaurants and trade houses. <ref>[http://www.terradaily.com/reports/Chinese_Come_To_Russia.html Chinese Come To Russia]</ref> This has been occurring a lot since the Soviet collapse.  . 

Illegal border crossing is considered a crime, and captured illegal border crossers have been sentenced to a prison term. For example, ''[[Rossiyskaya Gazeta]]'' reported in October 2008 the case of a [[North Korea]]n who was detained after illegally crossing the [[Amur River]] from China. Considered by Russian authorities an "economic migrant", he was sentenced to 6 months in prison and was to be deported to the country of his nationality after serving his sentence, even though he may now risk an even heavier penalty there. That was just one of the 26 cases year-to-date of illegal entrants, of various nationalities, receiving criminal punishment in [[Amur Oblast]]. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rg.ru/2008/10/29/reg-priamurje/koreets-anons.html|author=Yevgeniy Basenko (Евгений Басенко)|title=A North Korean has swum across the Amur, only to end up in a Russian prison.

===Saudi Arabia===. 
[[Saudi Arabia]] started construction of a [[separation barrier]] between its territory and [[Yemen]] to prevent the unauthorized movement of people and goods into and out of the kingdom. ''See [[Saudi-Yemen barrier]]''.  . 

In 2006, Saudi Arabia proposed plans for the construction of a security fence along the entire length of its 560-mile (900&nbsp;km) desert border with [[Iraq]] in a multimillion-pound project to secure the kingdom's borders in order to improve internal security, control illegal [[immigration]], and bolster its defences against external threats. <ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,7374-2126835,00.html/ Saudis plan to fence off border with chaos, The Times, April 10, 2006]. </ref>

===Syria===. 
Since the US-led invasion of [[Iraq]] in March 2003, there are more [[refugees of Iraq|refugees from Iraq]] . The [[United Nations]] estimates that nearly 2,200,000 [[Iraq]]is have fled the country since 2003,<ref>[http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article2640418.ece UN warns of five million Iraqi refugees]</ref> with nearly 100,000 fleeing to [[Syria]] and [[Jordan]] each month. <ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2006/11/03/un_nearly_100000_flee_iraq_monthly/ U.N.: 100,000 Iraq refugees flee monthly].

Syrian authorities worried that the new influx of refugees would limit the country's resources. Sources like oil, heat, water and electricity were said to be becoming scarcer as demand were rising. <ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/07/23/MNGPCR4S601.DTL&feed=rss.news Displaced Iraqis running out of cash, and prices are rising]. </ref> On October 1, 2007, news agencies reported that Syria reimposed restrictions on Iraqi refugees, as stated by a spokesperson for the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]].

===United States===. 
{{Main|Illegal immigration to the United States}}
Between 7 million and 20 million illegal immigrants are estimated to be living in the United States but the nature of illegal immigration makes the exact number be unknown. <ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0516/p01s02-ussc.html Illegal immigrants in the US: How many are there?], csmonitor.com</ref> Estimates from the Pew Hispanic Center show the number of illegal immigrants has declined to 11.1 million in March 2009 from a peak of 12 million in March 2007. <ref>[http://www.parwanilawfirm.com/immigration-news/90-illegal-immigration-down-sharply.html Illegal Immigration Down Sharply]</ref> The majority of the illegal immigrants are from Mexico. <ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4703307 Study Details Lives of Illegal Immigrants in U.S.], NPR</ref> Illegal immigration has been a longstanding issue in the United States, creating immense controversy. [[Harvard University]] economist [[George J. Borjas]] explains that the controversy centers around the "huge redistribution [of wealth] away from [unskilled U.S. Citizen] workers to [American employers] who use illegal immigrants."<ref name="usatoday.com">David J.

In 2007, President [[George W. Bush]] called for Congress to endorse his guest worker proposal, stating that illegal immigrants took jobs that Americans would not take. <ref name="usatoday.com"/> The [[Pew Hispanic Center]] notes that while the number of legal immigrants (including [[Lawful Permanent Resident|LPR]]s, refugees, and asylum seekers) arriving has not varied substantially since the 1980s, the number of illegal immigrants has increased dramatically and, since the mid 1990s, has surpassed the number of [[Immigration to the United States|legal immigrants]]. <ref>{{cite web |url= http://pewhispanic.org/files/reports/46.pdf |title= Unauthorized Migrants: Numbers and Characteristics |accessdate=2009-03-01 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= 2005-05-14 |work= |publisher= Pew Hispanic Center}}</ref> Penalties for employers who hire illegal immigrants range from $2,000–$10,000 and up to six months' imprisonment. <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/osc/ref/8usc1324a.htm |title=Title 8—Aliens and Nationality, Chapter 12—Immigration and Nationality, Subchapter II—Immigration (Sec. 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and 8 U.S.C. 1324a) |accessdate=2009-03-01 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= U.S. Code Online |publisher= United States Department of Justice}}</ref> However, penalties for employers go largely unenforced.  . 

Political groups like [[Americans for Legal Immigration]]<ref>[http://www.alipac.us ALIPAC]. </ref> have been formed to fight illegal immigration by demanding that the US enforce immigration laws and secure the borders. However, ALIPAC has also called for "safe departure" border checkpoints, free of criminal checks, for illegal activities. <ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/07/27/anti-immigrant-group-calls-safe-passage-illegals/ Anti-Immigrant Group Calls for 'Safe Passage' Of Illegals Out of U.S.]</ref>  .
