According to the data of the [[Ministry of Interior (Israel)|Israeli Interior Ministry]], the number of these illegal immigrants amounted to 26,635 people to July 2010. <ref>[http://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/data/pdf/m02625.pdf Data on crimes made by Illegal immigrants and asylum seekers and of crimes made against illegal immigrants and asylum seekers], October 2010, page 3</ref> . 

Many of the illegal immigrants seek an asylum status under the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] of the United Nations. Only a fraction of all the illegal immigrants is actually eligible for this status (see [[Sudanese refugees in Israel]]). However, many of them, mostly citizens of [[Eritrea]] and [[Sudan]], cannot be forcibly deported from Israel. The Eritrea citizens (who, since 2009, form the majority of the illegal immigrants in Israel) cannot be deported due to the opinion of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] that Eritrea has a difficult internal situation and a forced recruitment and therefore the Eritrean immigrants are defined as a "temporary humanitarian protection group". Despite the fact that a similar opinion does not exist in relation to citizens of Sudan, Israel does not deport them back to Egypt due to a real fear for their fate. <ref>[http://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/data/docs/m01790.doc Sudanese refugees and infiltrators in Israel, June 2007, page 1]</ref> Although the immigrants entered Israel from Egypt, Israel cannot deport them back to Egypt because the Egyptians refuse to give an undertaking not to deport the immigrants to their countries of origin. Accordingly, the Israeli authorities grant a temporary residence permit to the illegal immigrants, which needs to be renew every three months. Various authorities in Israel estimate that between 80–90 percent of the illegal immigrants live primarily in two centers: [[Tel Aviv]] (more than 60 percent of the Illegal immigrants) and [[Eilat]] (more than 20 percent), with a few in [[Ashdod]], [[Jerusalem]] and [[Arad, Israel|Arad]]. <ref>[http://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/data/pdf/m02625.pdf Data on crimes made by Illegal immigrants and asylum seekers and of crimes made against infiltrators and asylum seekers], October 2010, page 3</ref> . 

==Background==. 
In recent decades considerable efforts have been made of by many [[migrant workers]] from [[third world]] countries to immigrate to [[developed countries]] in order to improve their [[wages]] and [[quality of life]]. This is often done in contravention of immigration laws of the destination country, especially when infiltrating into it, such as [[Illegal immigration to the United States|infiltration made to the United States from the Mexican border]]. Developed countries are trying to combat this issue in various ways.  . 

As in other developed countries, the phenomenon of [[migrant workers]] also exists in Israel. Illegal immigrants from Africa to Israel is relatively easy due to Israel's land border with Egypt, which mostly is absent of obstacles.  . 

In some of the illegal immigrants' countries of origin humanitarian hardship exists. The [[UNHCR]] has declared [[Eritrea]] as a country in humanitarian crisis. In the [[Darfur]] region in western Sudan, a [[genocide]] has been taking place since 2003. As a result, many of its residents became refugees and fled to [[Egypt]]. Added to those were refugees from [[southern Sudan]], where [[Second Sudanese Civil War|civil war]] took place between the predominantly [[Arab]] [[Muslim]] inhabitants of the north and the non-Arab, [[Christians]] and [[animists]] inhabitants of the south.  . 

In 2009, in reports to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Israel stated that 90% of the illegal immigrants from Sudan and Eritrea are refugees. <ref>[http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=1191504] פליטים, לא מסתננים</ref> . 

==The development of illegal immigration from Africa to Israel==. 
In the second half of the 2000s, there was a significant increase in the number of illegal immigrants from Africa to Israel who crossed the Egyptian border. In 2006 about 1,000 illegal immigrants were caught; in 2007 about 5,000 were caught; in 2008 about 8,700 were caught; and in 2009 about 5,000 were caught. <ref>[http://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/data/pdf/m02524.pdf]</ref> In the first half of 2010 the Illegal immigration rate even further increased in the first seven months when over 8,000 Illegal immigrants were caught. <ref>[http://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/data/pdf/m02625.pdf]</ref> The total number of illegal immigrants is clearly greater than these figures, because many were not apprehended. The early wave of infiltrators came mainly from Sudan, while in 2009 the majority of the immigrants were from [[Eritrea]].  . 

In early May 2010, it was estimated that 24,339 illegal immigrants resided in Israel, of whom the number of Sudanese and Eritrean refugees who are not deportable under [[international law]] was 18,959: 5,649 Sudanese and 13,310 Eritreans. 16,766 of them received a special visa (ס 2א 5) granted to infiltrators who are non-deportable [[asylum seekers]]. Officially, the visa allows them only to stay in the country, but in practice the state also allows the refugees to work and avoids imposing fines on the Israeli employers who employ them. This special visa requires renewal every three months. <ref>[http://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/doc.asp?doc=m02534&type=pdf]</ref> 141 infiltrators, mostly from [[Ethiopia]], received [[refugee status]].  . 

According to the IDF's Operations Division in 2008, most of the countries from where the illegal immigrants came are(in descending order): [[Eritrea]], [[Sudan]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Ivory Coast]] and [[Nigeria]]. Most of the Illegal immigrants (85%) were men. <ref>[http://web.hevra.haifa.ac.il/~ch-strategy/images/publications/darfur_refugees.pdf]</ref> . 

=== The infiltration to Israel ===. 
African illegal immigrants in Israel usually initially arrive in [[Egypt]] from their country of origin through flights. From there they often pay sums of up to two thousand dollars for [[Bedouin]] smugglers to transfer them to the border between Egypt and Israel. There have been cases of abuse against the female illegal immigrants committed by the Bedouin smugglers, including [[rape]] and other degrations. Another danger lurking for the illegal immigrants is the Egyptian army policy to shoot at them in order to prevent crossing the Egypt/Israel border. <ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2008/1113/p06s03-wome.html Human Rights Watch faults Egypt's 'shoot-to-stop' policy]</ref><ref>[http://news.walla.co.il/?w=/0/1865224 תופעה בגבול הדרומי: הצבא המצרי יורה במסתננים]</ref> . 

=== The housing and occupations of the Illegal immigrants in Israel ===. 
Except for the Illegal immigrants held at prison facilities (about 1,900 in August 2010), the rest live and/or work in Israel. The Israeli department of immigration does not keep continuous supervision over their place of residence but, according to estimates based on data from the Israeli police, the local authorities and the aid organizations, between 15,000–17,000 illegal immigrants live in Tel Aviv (especially in south Tel Aviv, although the number includes also the illegal immigrants who live in Bat Yam and Bnei Brak) and between 4,000 to 6,000 in Eilat. Ashdod estimates range from 500 to 2,000 in Arad 400 to 600. <ref>[http://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/data/pdf/m02625.pdf]</ref> Their prominent Practice jobs in hotels, especially in Eilat.  . 

The number of criminal cases opened against illegal immigrants is relatively low in number, as regards cases involving crimes committed against the general population where they live. However, according to the research department of the Israel Police and Israel's foreign immigrants' crime is characterized by predominantly sectoral internal crime, in which a gun is not reported, and illegal immigrants generally have no interest in complaining to the police. <ref>[http://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/data/pdf/m02625.pdf]</ref> . 

==The development of the state's treatment towards the Illegal immigrants==.

==Aid organizations==. 
Israel has a number of organizations focused on helping the illegal immigrants in Israel. In some cases the organizations have compared the Holocaust refugees to the African infiltrators. Relief organizations have been involved in discussions held in Knesset committees on this issue and have submitted a petition against the measures the state has taken to put a halt to the phenomenon of infiltration.  . 

==Reactions in Israel to the illegal immigration phenomenon==. 
The Israeli geographer [[Arnon Sofer]] has expressed his opposition to the African illegal immigration phenomenon for several reasons – From a security perspective, they may serve as [[informant]]s or as operatives of hostile states or [[terrorist organization]]s. Socially, they are contributing to the [[:wikt:congestion|congestion]] in the cities and to the rise in [[crime]].  From the demographic perspective, the already existing [[Demographic threat#Israel|demographic threat]] to the [[Israeli Jews|Jewish majority]] only worsens by the gradual increase of illegal immigrants. According to Sofer, failing to stop the illegal immigration waves at an early stage will only lead to much larger waves of illegal immigration in the future. <ref>[http://web.hevra.haifa.ac.il/~ch-strategy/images/publications/darfur_refugees.pdf]</ref> . 

In Israeli cities which have high rates of African illegal immigrants a resistance has emerged amongst the local population against this phenomenon. In mid-2010, a demonstration was held in Eilat against the non-action of the Israeli government, the residents claimed that they are now afraid to walk outside at certain neighborhoods at night. <ref>[http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3918106,00.html]</ref> In the Shapira and Kiryat Shalom neighborhoods in the southern part of Tel Aviv a number of real estate agents have stated that they intend not to rent apartments in these neighborhoods to the illegal immigrants. <ref>[http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/1182624.html לא נשכיר דירות לשב"חים]</ref> . 

On the other hand, demonstrations, rallies and other event supporting the refugees have also been held regularly. <ref>[http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001052021479&sk=wall Ann Tifa Rave] [[Antifa]] [[rave]] for refugees</ref><ref>[http://wn.com/Darfur_Muslim_Refugees_demonstrating_in_Israel_to_support_ICC Darfur Muslim Refugees Demonstrating In Israel To Support Icc]</ref><ref>[http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/7708463-african-refugees-protest-in-israel African Refugees Protest in Israel protests]</ref> . 

The Israeli economic commentator [[Nehemiah Shtrasler]] estimated that the illegal immigrants take the places of weaker manual workers, causing loss of jobs and a reduction in the wages. He also claimed that they burden the health care, welfare and education systems. "We would never be able to raise the standard of living of the needy and reduce the gaps, if we keep on absorbing more and more destitute people". <ref>[http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/1190623.html]</ref> .
