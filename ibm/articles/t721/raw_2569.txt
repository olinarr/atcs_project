The '''Greek government debt crisis''' is one of a number of current [[European sovereign debt crisis|European sovereign debt crises]]. 
Beginning in late 2009, fears of a [[sovereign debt crisis]] developed among [[investors]] concerning Greece's ability to meet its debt obligations due to strong increase in [[government debt]] levels. <ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE61F0W720100216 |title= Peripheral euro zone government bond spreads widen |agency=Reuters |author=George Matlock |date=16 February 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16009099 | title=Acropolis now | work=The Economist | date= 29 April 2010 |accessdate=22 June 2011}}</ref> This led to a crisis of confidence, indicated by a widening of [[bond (finance)|bond]] [[yield spread]]s and the cost of risk insurance on [[credit default swap]]s compared to the other countries in the [[Eurozone]], most importantly Germany. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.financialmirror.com/News/Cyprus_and_World_News/20151 |title=Greek/German bond yield spread more than 1,000 bps |publisher=Financialmirror.com |date=28 April 2010 |accessdate=5 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7d25573c-1ccc-11df-8d8e-00144feab49a.html |title=Gilt yields rise amid UK debt concerns |work=Financial Times  |date=18 February 2010 |accessdate=15 April 2011}}</ref> Downgrading of Greek government debt to [[junk bond]] status in April 2010, created alarm in financial markets. On 2 May 2010, the [[Eurozone]] countries and the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] agreed on a {{Nowrap|€110 billion}} bailout loan for Greece, conditional on the implementation of harsh austerity measures. In October 2011, Eurozone leaders agreed to offer a second {{Nowrap|€130 billion}} bailout loan for Greece, conditional not only the implementation of another harsh austerity package, but also that all private creditors should agree to a restructure of the Greek debt, reducing the debt burden from a forecasted 198% of GDP in 2012 to only 120.5% of GDP by 2020. The second bailout deal was finally ratified by all parties in February 2012, and became activated one month later, after the last condition about a successful debt restructure of all Greek government bonds, also had been met. Money-wise the latest bailout plan is set to cover all Greek financial needs in the next three years from 2012-2014. If Greece can manage to comply with all economic targets outlined in the bailout plan, a full return to use the private capital markets for covering future financial needs, will be possible again in 2015.  . 

==Causes==. 
In order to understand when, how and why the Greek government-debt crisis erupted (and eventually can be solved), it is important to remember the crisis is not limited to a simple debt level problem. Several other main causes exist along with the debt level problem. Already in January 2010, before the extent of the debt-crisis was truly known, the [[Ministry of Finance (Greece)|Greek Ministry of Finance]] highlighted in their ''Stability and Growth Program 2010'', these five main causes for the significantly deteriorated economic results recorded in 2009 (compared to the published budget figures ahead of the year):<ref name="europa1">{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/sgp/pdf/20_scps/2009-10/01_programme/el_2010-01-15_sp_en.pdf|title=Update of the Hellenic  Stability and Growth Programme|work=Greek Ministry of Finance|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=9 October 2011|date=15 January 2010}}</ref> . 

* '''GDP growth rates:''' After 2008, GDP growth rates were lower than the [[Hellenic Statistical Authority|Greek national statistical agency]] had anticipated. With the Greek government now acknowledging the need for implementing economic reforms to improve competitiveness (being hampered during the last decade, due to excessive salary increases and counterproductive bureaucratic laws and procedures), and the need to redirect much of its current governmental spending from non-growth sectors (e.g. military) into growth stimulating sectors.  . 

* '''Government deficit:''' Huge fiscal imbalances developed during the past six years from 2004 to 2009, where ''"the output increased in nominal terms by 40%, while central government primary expenditures increased by 87% against an increase of only 31% in tax revenues."'' Thus the Greek government now acknowledge the need to restore the fiscal balance of the public budget, by implementing permanent real expenditure cuts (meaning expenditures are only allowed to grow 3.8% from 2009 to 2013, which is below the expected inflation at 6.9%), and with overall revenues planned to grow 31.5% from 2009 to 2013, secured not only by new/higher taxes but also by a major reform of the ineffective Tax Collection System.  . 

* '''Government debt-level:''' As it had not been reduced during the good years with strong economic growth, there was no room for the government to continue running large deficits in 2010 or for the years ahead. So it was not enough for the government, just to implement the needed long term economic reforms, as the debt then rapidly would develop into an unsustainable size, before the results of such reforms were achieved. Thus the government acknowledged, that they now needed immediately needed to implement both permanent and temporary austerity measures, so that in combination with an expected return of positive GDP growth rates in 2011, would result in the baseline deficit decreasing from €30.6 billion in 2009 to only €5.6 billion in 2013, finally making it possible to stabilize the debt-level relative to GDP at 120% in 2010 and 2011 - followed by a downward trend in 2012 and 2013.  . 

* '''Political budget compliance:''' Was acknowledged to be in strong need of future improvement, and for 2009 it was even found to be: ''"A lot worse than normal, due to economic control being more lax in a year with political elections"''. In order to improve the level of budget compliance for upcoming years, the Greek government wanted to implement a new reform to strengthen the monitoring system in 2010, making it possible to keep better track on the future developments of revenues and expenses, both at the governmental and local level.  . 

* '''Statistical credibility:''' Problems with unreliable data had existed ever since Greece applied for membership of the Euro in 1999. In the five years from 2005–2009, [[Eurostat]] each year noted a reservation about the fiscal statistical numbers for Greece, and way to often previously reported figures got revised to a somewhat worse figure, after a couple of years. <ref name="Review of Greek statistical issues">{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/COM_2010_REPORT_GREEK/EN/COM_2010_REPORT_GREEK-EN.PDF|title=Report on Greek government deficit and debt statistics |work=European Comission|accessdate=8 January 2010|date=8 January 2010}}</ref> In regards of 2009 the flawed statistics made it impossible to predict accurate numbers for GDP growth, budget deficit and the public debt; which by the end of the year all turned out to be far worse than originally anticipated. As the new Greek government acknowledged the need for a stronger statistical credibility, both in order to restore the trust among financial investors and as a mean for the government to better know the level and necessity of future economic reforms (in advance), they now pledged to correct all previous statistical methodological issues, ''"by making the [[Hellenic Statistical Authority|National Statistics Service]] an independent legal entity and phasing in, during the first quarter of 2010, all the necessary checks and balances that will improve the accuracy and reporting of fiscal statistics"''.  .

The Greek economy was one of the fastest growing in the eurozone from 2000 to 2007; during that period, it grew at an annual rate of 4.2% as foreign capital flooded the country. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://greeceinfo.wordpress.com/2009/09/17/greece-foreign-capital-inflows-up/ |title=Greece: Foreign Capital Inflows Up |publisher=Embassy of Greece in Poland (Greeceinfo.wordpress.com) |date=17 September 2009 |accessdate=5 May 2010}}</ref>  A strong economy and falling bond yields allowed the government of Greece to run large [[structural deficits]].  . 

According to an editorial published by the Greek right-wing newspaper [[Kathimerini]], large public deficits are one of the features that have marked the Greek social model since the [[Metapolitefsi|restoration of democracy in 1974]]. After the removal of the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|right-wing military junta]], the government wanted to bring disenfranchised left-leaning portions of the population into the economic mainstream. <ref>{{Cite news| first=Demetrius A | last=Floudas| title=The Greek Financial Crisis 2010: Chimerae and Pandaemonium | url=http://www.talks.cam.ac.uk/talk/index/23660| publisher=University of Cambridge | location=Hughes Hall Seminar Series, March 2010}}</ref>  In order to do so, successive Greek governments have, among other things, customarily run large deficits to finance public sector jobs, pensions, and other social benefits. <ref>{{cite web| title = Back down to earth with a bang | url = http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_columns_1_08/03/2010_115465 | publisher=[[Kathimerini]] (English Edition) | date = 3 March 2010 | accessdate =12 May 2010 }}</ref> Since 1994, the ratio of debt to GDP has remained above 94.0%. <ref>{{cite web| title=Government deficit/surplus, debt and associated data | url=http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?query=BOOKMARK_DS-053864_QID_1F0B9C55_UID_-3F171EB0&layout=TIME,C,X,0;GEO,L,Y,0;UNIT,L,Z,0;SECTOR,L,Z,1;INDIC_NA,L,Z,2;INDICATORS,C,Z,3;&zSelection=DS-053864INDICATORS,OBS_FLAG;DS-053864SECTOR,S13;DS-053864INDIC_NA,GD;DS-053864UNIT,PC_GDP;&rankName1=TIME_1_0_0_0&rankName2=SECTOR_1_2_-1_2&rankName3=INDIC-NA_1_2_-1_2&rankName4=INDICATORS_1_2_-1_2&rankName5=UNIT_1_2_-1_2&rankName6=GEO_1_2_0_1&sortR=CUSTOM_-1_FIRST&pprRK=FIRST&pprSO=CUSTOM&ppcRK=FIRST&ppcSO=ASC&sortC=ASC_-1_FIRST&rStp=&cStp=&rDCh=&cDCh=&rDM=true&cDM=true&footnes=false&empty=false&wai=false&time_mode=ROLLING&lang=EN&cfo=%23%23%23%2C%23%23%23.%23%23%23|publisher=Eurostat|date=28 November 2011}}</ref> In the turmoil of the [[late-2000s financial crisis|Global Financial Crisis]] it rapidly grew above the unsustainable maximum level for Greece (defined by a majority of economists to be 120%). According to ''"The Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece"'' published by the EU Commission in October 2011, the debt level is even expected to reach a highly unsustainable level of 198% in 2012, if the proposed debt restructure agreement is not implemented. <ref name="EC draft"/> . 

Initially, currency [[devaluation]] helped finance the borrowing. After the introduction of the euro in January 2001, the devaluation tool disappeared. Throughout the next 8 years, Greece was however able to continue its high level of borrowing, due to the lower interest rates government bonds in euro could command, in combination with a long series of strong GDP growth rates. Problems however started to rise, when the [[late-2000s financial crisis|Global Financial Crisis]] peaked with negative repercussions hitting all national economies in September 2008. The Global Financial Crisis had a particularly large negative impact on the GDP growth rates in Greece. Two of the country's largest industries are tourism and shipping, and both were badly affected by the downturn, with revenues falling 15% in 2009. <ref name="tempsreel.nouvelobs.com">{{cite web| title = Onze questions-réponses sur la crise grecque | url = http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/economie/20100505.OBS3509/onze-questions-reponses-sur-la-crise-grecque.html | publisher=Nouvelobs.com|date =5 May 2010 }}</ref> Another consistent problem Greece has suffered from in recent decades, is the government's tax income. Each year it is several times below the expected level. In 2010, the estimated tax evasion costs for the Greek government amounted to well over {{Nowrap|$20 billion}} per year. <ref>{{Cite news|title=Greeks and the state: An uncomfortable couple|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9FF7K681.htm|date=3 May 2010|agency=Bloomberg Businessweek}}</ref> . 

To keep within the [[Euro convergence criteria|monetary union guidelines]], the government of Greece had also for many years misreported the country's official economic statistics. <ref>{{cite web| title = EU Stats Office: Greek Economy Figures Unreliable | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=9541636 | accessdate =2 May 2010 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101007143658/http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=9541636 |archivedate=October 2010| publisher=ABC News| date=12 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title = Rehn: No other state will need a bail-out

In February 2010, the new government of [[George Papandreou]] (elected in October 2009), revised the 2009 deficit from a previously estimated 5% to an alarming 12.7% of GDP. <ref>{{Cite web| title = Greece's sovereign-debt crunch: A very European crisis | url = http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15452594 | publisher=The Economist| date = 4 February 2010| accessdate =2 May 2010 }}</ref> In April 2010, the reported 2009 deficit was further increased to 13.6%,<ref name="Greek Deficit Revised to 13.6%; Moody's Cuts Rating (Update2)">{{cite web| title = Papandreou Faces Bond Rout as Budget Worsens, Workers Strike | url = http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601068&sid=aUi3XLUwIIVA | publisher=Bloomberg.com|date=22 April 2010|accessdate =2 May 2010 }}</ref> and at the time of the final revised calculation by [[Eurostat]] it ended at 15.8% of GDP, which proved to be the highest deficit for any EU country in 2009. The figure for Greek government debt at the end of 2009, was also increased from its first November estimate at  {{Nowrap|€269.3 billion}} (113% of GDP),<ref>{{Cite news| title = Greek debt to reach 120.8 pct of GDP in '10&nbsp;– draft| url = http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSATH00496420091105 |publisher=Reuters | date =  5 November 2009| accessdate =2 May 2010 }}</ref><ref name="Analysis of Greek debt crisis pr April 2009">{{Cite news| title = Greece's sovereign-debt crisis: Still in a spin | url = http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15908288 | publisher=The Economist| date = 15 April 2010| accessdate =2 May 2010}}</ref> to a revised {{Nowrap|€299.5 billion}} (129% of GDP). This major upward revision of the deficit and debt level, was caused by flawed estimates and statistics previously being reported by the Greek authorities in 2009, resulting in the need for Eurostat to perform an in depth [[Greek Financial Audits, 2009-2010|Financial Audit of the fiscal years 2006-09]]. After having conducted the financial audit, Eurostat noted in November 2010, that all "methodological issues" now had been fixed, and that the new revised numbers for 2006-2009 now finally was considered as being reliable. <ref>{{Cite news| title = Eurostat Newsrelease 170/2010: Provision of deficit and debt data for 2009 - Second notification| url =http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-15112010-AP/EN/2-15112010-AP-EN.PDF | publisher=Eurostat| date =15 November 2010| accessdate =19 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| title = Report on the EDP methodological visits to Greece in 2010|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/government_finance_statistics/documents/Greece%20-%202010%20methodological%20visits%20report.pdf |publisher=Eurostat| date =15 November 2010| accessdate =19 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| title = Greece’s revised 2009 deficit tops 15% of GDP: Eurostat lifts reservations over Greek methodology| url =http://www.marketwatch.com/story/greeces-revised-2009-deficit-tops-15-of-gdp-2010-11-15 | publisher=MarketWatch| date =15 November 2010| accessdate =19 February 2012}}</ref> . 

Despite the crisis, the Greek governments bond auction in January 2010, had the offered amount of €8bn 5-year bonds over-subscribed by four times. <ref>{{cite web|author=Andrew Willis |url=http://euobserver.com/9/29338 |title=Greek bond auction provides some relief |publisher=EU Observer |date=26 January 2010 |accessdate=15 April 2011}}</ref> At the next auction in March, the [[Financial Times]] again reported: ''"Athens sold €5bn in 10-year bonds and received orders for three times that amount"''. <ref>{{cite web| title = Strong demand for 10-year Greek bond | url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/245030a8-2773-11df-b0f1-00144feabdc0.html | publisher=Financial Times |date=4 March 2010|accessdate =2 May 2010 }}</ref> The continued successful auction and sale of bonds, was however only possible at the cost of increased yields, which in return caused a further worsening of the Greek public deficit. As a result, the rating agencies finally downgraded the Greece economy to junk status in late April 2010. In practical terms this caused the private capital market to freeze, so that all the Greek financial needs now instead had to be covered by international bailout loans, in order to avoid a [[sovereign default]]. <ref>{{cite web| title=Standard & Poor's downgrade Greek credit rating to junk status |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/apr/27/greece-credit-rating-downgraded| publisher=The Guardian |date=27 April 2010|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> In April 2010, it was estimated that up to 70% of Greek government bonds were held by foreign investors (primarily banks). <ref name="Analysis of Greek debt crisis pr April 2009"/> The subsequent bailout loans paid to Greece, were mainly used to pay for the maturing bonds, but of course also to finance the continued yearly budget deficits.  .

==Evolution of the crisis==. 
In the early-mid 2000s, Greece's economy was strong and the government took advantage by running a large deficit, partly due to high defense spending amid [[Greek–Turkish relations|historic enmity to Turkey]]. As the world economy cooled in the late 2000s, Greece was hit especially hard because its main industries — [[Greek Merchant Navy|shipping]] and [[tourism in Greece|tourism]] — were especially sensitive to changes in the business cycle. As a result, the country's debt began to pile up rapidly. In early 2010, as concerns about Greece's national debt grew, policy makers suggested that emergency bailouts might be necessary.  .

Without a [[bailout]] agreement, there was a possibility that Greece would prefer to [[Sovereign default|default]] on some of its debt. The premiums on Greek debt had risen to a level that reflected a high chance of a default or restructuring. Analysts gave a wide range of default probabilities, estimating a 25% to 90% chance of a default or restructuring. <ref>{{cite web| title = 'De-facto' Greek default 80% sure: Global Insight&nbsp;– MarketWatch | url = http://www.marketwatch.com/story/de-facto-greek-default-80-sure-global-insight-2010-04-28 | publisher=MarketWatch | date = 28 April 2010 | accessdate =2 May 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Government Debt Issuers Most Likely to Default| url =http://www.cnbc.com/id/34465366/Government_Debt_Issuers_Most_Likely_to_Default?slide=3 | work=CNBC.com| page=3| publisher=CNBC | date = 1 March 2010 }}</ref>   . 

A default would most likely have taken the form of a restructuring where Greece would pay creditors, which include the up to €110&nbsp;billion 2010 Greece bailout participants i.e. Eurozone governments and IMF, only a portion of what they were owed, perhaps 50 or 25 percent. <ref>{{cite web| title = Greece Turning Viral Sparks Search for EU Solutions (Update2)&nbsp;– Bloomberg.com | url = http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601010&sid=aCW0uYHW707A | publisher=Bloomberg | date = 29 April 2010 | accessdate =2 May 2010 }}

Some experts have nonetheless argued that the best option at this stage for Greece is to engineer an “orderly [[default (finance)|default]]” on Greece’s public debt which would allow Athens to withdraw simultaneously from the eurozone and reintroduce a national currency, such as its historical [[drachma]], at a debased rate<ref name="ReferenceB">M. Nicolas J. Firzli, "Greece and the Roots the EU Debt Crisis" ''The Vienna Review'', March  2010</ref> (essentially, coining money).

At the moment, because Greece is a member of the eurozone, it cannot unilaterally stimulate its economy with monetary policy, as has happened with other economic zones, for example the U.S. Federal Reserve expanding its balance sheet over {{Nowrap|$1.3&nbsp;trillion}} since the global financial crisis began, temporarily creating new money and injecting it into the system by purchasing outstanding debt, that money to be destroyed when the debt is paid back, later. <ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60D5WK20100114 |agency=Reuters   | first=Burton | last=Frierson | title=Fed's balance sheet liabilities hit record | date=14 January 2010}}</ref> . 

===Downgrading of creditworthiness===. 
On 23 April 2010, the Greek government requested an EU/IMF bailout package to be activated, providing them with a loan of {{Nowrap|€45 billion}} to cover their financial needs for the remaining part of 2010. <ref>{{Cite document|title=Greek Bailout Talks Could Take Three Weeks|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-04-20/greek-bailout-talks-could-take-three-weeks-bond-payment-looms.html|date=20 April 2012}}</ref>{{dead link|date=February 2012}}<ref>{{Cite web|title=Greece Seeks Activation of €45bn EU/IMF Aid Package|work=The Irish Times |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/0423/breaking28.html | date=4 April 2010}}</ref>

Credit rating agencies immediately downgraded Greek governmental bonds to an even lower junk status. 
This was followed by an announcement of the ECB on 3 May that it will still accept as collateral all outstanding and new debt instruments issued or guaranteed by the Greek government, regardless of the nation's credit rating, in order to maintain banks' liquidity. <ref name="Polya Lesova 2010">{{cite web|last=Lesova|first=Polya|title=ECB suspends rating threshold for Greece debt instruments|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ecb-suspends-rating-threshold-for-greek-debt-2010-05-03-3400|work=MarketWatch|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=5 May 2010|date=3 May 2010}}</ref> The new austerity package was met with great anger by the Greek public, leading to [[May 2010 Greek protests|massive protests]], riots and social unrest throughout Greece.

In Athens some protests turned violent, killing three people. <ref name="NY Times protest" /> . 

Still the situation did not improve. It was originally hoped that Greece’s first adjustment plan together with the {{Nowrap|€110 billion}} support package would reestablish Greek access to private capital markets by the end of 2012. However it was soon found that this process would take much longer. 
The November 2010 revisions of 2009 deficit and debt levels made accomplishment of the 2010 targets even harder, and indications signaled a recession harsher than originally feared. <ref>{{cite news|last=Skrekas|first=Nick|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703453804575479162284898390.html|title=Greek GDP Revised Down|work=Wall Street Journal|date=8 September 2010|accessdate=19 May 2011}}</ref> In May 2011 it became evident that due to the severe economic crisis tax revenues were lower than expected, making it even harder for Greece to meet its fiscal goals. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/jun/19/greek-debt-crisis-eurozone-ministers?intcmp=239 |title=Greek debt crisis: eurozone ministers meet amid deepening gloom |work=The Guardian |date=19 June 2011 |accessdate=24 October 2011 |first=Ian |last=Traynor |location=London}}</ref> .

The argument for the latter part of this radical approach, was that Greece also strongly needed to improve its competitiveness in order to reestablish positive growth rates, and a reintroduction of the old drachma would enable Greece to return using the [[devaluation]] tool as a mean for that. <ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref name="Roubini-orderly-default">{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a3874e80-82e8-11df-8b15-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1YqwjSbNl|author=Nouriel Roubini|title=Greece’s best option is an orderly default|work=Financial Times|date=28 June 2010|accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref> In June 2011, a majority of the economists indeed agreed to recommend an orderly default straight away, as it was predicted to be unavoidable for Greece at the long term, and that a delay in organising an orderly default (by lending Greece more money throughout a few more years), would just wind up hurting EU lenders and neighboring European countries even more. <ref name="telegraph-head-in-sand">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/8594698/EU-accused-of-head-in-sand-attitude-to-Greek-debt-crisis.html|author=Louise Armitstead|title=EU accused of 'head in sand' attitude to Greek debt crisis|work=The Telegraph|date=23 June  2011|accessdate=24 September 2011|location=London}}</ref> However, if Greece were to leave the euro, the economic and political impact would be devastating.

To avoid a chaotic Greek disorderly default and/or the systemic risks to the Eurozone in the scenario with Greece leaving the Euro, the EU leaders decided in October 2011, to engineer and offer an [[Default (finance)#Orderly defaults|orderly default]] combined with a €130bn bailout loan, making it possible for Greece to continue as a full member of the Euro. The offered orderly default and bailout loan, was however conditional, that Greece at the same time approved a new harsh austerity package. <ref name="bbc-2012-02-09"/> . 

On 12 February 2012, amid riots in Athens and other cities that left stores looted and burned and more than 120 people injured, the Greek parliament approved the new harsh austerity package, with a 199-74 majority. Forty-three lawmakers from the ruling Socialist [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]] and conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] who voted against the bill were immediately expelled from their parties, reducing the ruling coalitions's majority in the 300-seat parliament from 236 to 193. <ref name="bailout-vote">{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/02/12/greece-bailout-vote.html | title=Greece passes new austerity deal amid rioting | publisher=CBC News | date=12 February 2012 | accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref> The vote is now expected to pave the way for the EU, ECB and IMF to jointly release the funds, which are supposed to cover all the Greek financial needs in 2012-2014.

On 21 February 2012 the Eurogroup finalized the second bailout package (see below), which was extended from €109 billion to €130 billion.

On 9 March 2012 a crucial milestone was reached, when it was announced that 85.8% of private holders of Greek government bonds regulated by Greek law (equal to {{nowrap|€152 billion}}), had agreed to the [[debt restructuring]] deal. As this number was above the 75% threshold, it enabled the Greek government to activate a [[collective action clause]] (CAC), so that the remaining 14.2% (equal to {{nowrap|€25 billion}}) were also forced to agree. At the same time it was announced that 69.8% of private holders of Greek government bonds regulated by foreign law (equal to {{nowrap|€20 billion}}), also had agreed to the debt restructuring deal. Thus, the total amount of debt to be restructured was now guaranteed to be minimum 95.7% (equal to {{nowrap|€197 out of €206 billion}}), while the remaining 4.3% of the private holders (equal to {{nowrap|€9 billion}}) were offered a prolonged deadline at March 23 to voluntarily join the debt swap. <ref name="Accept percentage for the restructure of Greek debt">{{cite news |url=http://av.r.ftdata.co.uk/files/2012/03/9-MARCH-2012.pdf|format=PDF |title=Hellenic Republic - Ministry of Finance - Press release (9 March)|work=Ministry of Finance |date=9 March 2012 |accessdate=9 March 2012}}</ref> .

==Countermeasures==. 
===Measures taken by the Greek government===. 
Greece adopted a number of [[austerity]] packages since 2010. According to research published on 5 May 2010 by [[Citibank]], the fiscal tightening is "unexpectedly tough". The first 3 austerity packages will amount to a total of €30&nbsp;billion (equal to 12.5% of the 2009 Greek GDP), and consist of tightenings equal to 5% of GDP in 2010, with a further set of tightenings equal to 4% of GDP in 2011. <ref name="citibank">Global Economics Flash, Greek Sovereign Debt Restructuring Delayed but Not Avoided for Long, 5 May 2010, ''"The amount of fiscal tightening announced over the next three years is even larger than we expected: €30 bn worth of spending cuts and tax increases, around 12.5% of the 2009 Greek GDP, and an even higher percentage of the average annual GDP over the next three years (2010–2012). With 5 percentage points of GDP tightening in 2010 and 4 percentage points of GDP tightening in 2011, the economy should contract quite sharply&nbsp;– between 3 and 4 percent this year and probably another 1 or 2 percent contraction in 2011."''</ref> . 

====First austerity package – February 2010====. 
The first round came with the signing of the memorandums with the [[IMF]] and the [[ECB]] concerning a loan of €80&nbsp;billion. The package was implemented on 9 February 2010 and included a freeze in the salaries of all government employees, a 10% cut in bonuses, as well as cuts in overtime workers, public employees and work-related travels. <ref name="Austerity 1">{{cite web |url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.article&id=130472 |title=Πάγωμα μισθών και περικοπές επιδομάτων ανακοίνωσε η κυβέρνηση |trans_title=Government announced cuts and a freeze in salaries |date=9 February 2010 |publisher=enet.gr |accessdate=14 August 2011}}</ref> .

==== Negotiations about a fifth austerity package (October 2011 – January 2012) ====. 
In October, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou got parliamentary backing for further austerity measures.

==== Fifth austerity package – February 2012 ====. 
In February 2012, facing [[sovereign default]], Greece was in need of more funds from the IMF and EU by 20 March 2012, and was negotiating over the next lending package, worth €130 billion. On 10 February 2012, the Greek cabinet approved the draft bill of a new austerity plan, which has been calculated to improve the 2012 budget deficit with €3.3 billion (and a further €10 billion improvement scheduled for 2013 and 2014). The austerity plan includes:<ref name="SZ-staat-neu"/><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-02-13/greece-votes-in-favour-of-austerity-plan/3826308 | title=Greece MPs clear way for $170bn bailout | publisher=ABC News | date=13 February 2012 | accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref>
* 22% cut in minimum wage from the current €750 per month. 
* Holiday wage bonuses (two extra months of full wage being paid each year) are permanently cancelled. 
* 150,000 jobs cut from state sector by 2015, of which 15,000 shall be cut by the end of 2012. 
* Pension cuts worth €300 million in 2012. 
* Changes to laws to make it easier to lay off workers. 
* Health and defense spending cuts. 
* Industry sectors are given the right to negotiate lower wages depending on economic development. 
* Opening up closed professions to allow for more competition, particularly in the health, tourism, and real estate sectors. 
* Privatizations worth €15 billion by 2015, including Greek gas companies [[DEPA]] and [[DESFA]]. In the medium term, the goal remains at €50 billion.  . 

The latest round of austerity measures means Greece will likely face at least another year of recession, presaging another round of business closures, before the economy will start to grow again,<ref name="FT 17 February 2012"/> and foreign observers were shocked by the cold-heartedness of German negotiators. <ref name="Inman 04Mar2012">{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics-blog/2012/mar/04/debt-crisis-eu |title=Germany has run out of patience |author=Phillip Inman |date=4 March 2012 |work=Economics blog |publisher=guardian.co.uk |accessdate=5 March 2012}}</ref> . 

Showing position of disagreement, the transport minister [[Makis Voridis]] from the [[Popular Orthodox Rally]] party, along with five deputy ministers from various ministries, decided to resign. <ref name=smh2012>{{cite web|title=Greek government approves debt deal|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/world-business/greek-government-approves-debt-deal-20120211-1sxxf.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=11 February 2012}}</ref> On 11 February, caretaker prime minister [[Lucas Papademos]] warned of "social explosion and chaos" if the parliament would not approve the deal the next day. Speaking to members of Parliament before their vote, Papademos stated that if the majority of them chose to vote against the austerity measures there would be several onerous consequences, including that the government would not be able to pay the salaries of its employees. On 13 February, the Greek Parliament subsequently approved this latest round of austerity measures by a vote of 199 to 74.  During the period of parliamentary debate, massive protests were witnessed in Athens that left stores looted and burned and more than 120 people injured. The riot was one of the worst since 2010. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/02/12/world/europe/greece-debt-crisis/index.html|title=Clashes erupt as Greek Parliament debates austerity measures|date=12 February 2012|publisher=CNN|accessdate=12 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17003432|title=Buildings set ablaze as Greek MPs debate austerity plan|date=12 February 2012|work=BBC News|accessdate=12 February 2012}}</ref> . 

Despite being one of the ruling parties, the [[Popular Orthodox Rally]] voted against the plan and withdrew itself from the government. Forty-three [[Member of parliament|MPs]] from the other two ruling parties (socialist [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]] and conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]]) also voted against the plan and were immediately expelled from their parties. This reduced the combined power of these two parties from 236 to 193 seats, which is still majority for the 300-seat parliament of Greece. <ref name="bailout-vote"/> The vote was a major precondition for the EU and IMF to jointly release the funds, which are supposed to cover all financial needs in 2012 and 2013, with the hope that Greece can start lending again at the private capital markets in 2014. <ref name="bbc-2012-02-09"/> . 

The determination of the leaders of Greek ruling parties to implement the new austerity package was however doubted. For example, [[Antonis Samaras]] (leader of New Democracy) talked about renegotiating the deal, despite voting for the austerity package. Because of such uncertainty, the Eurozone finance ministers demanded Greek main politicians to sign a written assurance for their continued support to implement the austerity package, both before and after any elections. <ref>http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/7cb53ba0-573a-11e1-869b-00144feabdc0.html?ftcamp=published_links/rss/world_europe/feed//product#axzz1mHXI7oHR</ref> . 

After passing the new austerity package on 13 February, there still remained four other hurdles for Greece, to receive the new €130 billion bailout loan:<ref>http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/02/13/uk-greece-steps-idUKTRE81C0XN20120213</ref> . 

* €325 million out of the total €3.3 billion austerity package still needed to be specified in the form of some exact "structural expenditure reductions", to be outlined and passed by a separate political bill. 
* Written commitments from the main party leaders should be filed, to guarantee their continued support for the austerity program, both before and after elections in April 2012. 
* The debt restructure agreement, with a debt write-off worth €107 billion, needs to be implemented by a bond swap in early March 2012, involving minimum 95% of the private creditors. Under the terms of the deal, all the holders (banks, pension funds, insurers and others) of €206 billion in Greek government bonds, would have to ''-if they accept the deal either voluntarily or by a collective action clause-'' write down the face value of their holdings by 53.5%, by swapping bonds they hold for longer-dated securities that pay a lower coupon. When calculated for the bonds with the longest maturity, the 53.5% haircut of face value, will be equal to a 74% loss on the net present value of the debt. 
* A debt sustainability report by the Troika, based upon the full implementation of the latest austerity package and the debt restructure agreement, needs to show a sustainable outlook for the Greek economy, with the debt relative to GDP being reduced to 120% in 2020.  . 

As of 19 February, Greece had managed to pass the first two hurdles. The debt restructure agreement and the result of the debt sustainability report was however still pending. Some of the newest calculations suggested that Greece would now need an enhanced bailout at €136 billion, and they were still likely to exceed the 120% debt level in 2020. It is now up to the Troika to decide if this can be accepted under the previous terms. Alternatively, the slightly worse outlook for the debt numbers can also be counterfeited, by some further debt restructuring and/or demands for additional austerity measures. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/2f4cab6c-5b1a-11e1-a2b3-00144feabdc0.html|title=Eurozone seeks central banks' help in Greek bail-out|publisher=Financial Times|date=19 February 2012|accessdate=20 February 2012}}</ref> . 

==== Fight against corruption and tax evasion ====. 
[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] estimated in August 2009, the size of the Greek [[black market]] to be around €65bn (equal to 25% of GDP), resulting each year in €20bn of unpaid taxes. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/international/500632/index.do |newspaper=Die Presse |title=Korruption und Steuerhinterziehung: Griechenland versinkt im Sumpf|date=5 August 2009|accessdate=5 May 2010}}</ref> This is a European record in relative terms, and in comparison almost twice as big as the German black market (estimated to 15% of GDP). Several successive Greek governments had in the past attempted to improve the situation, but all failed. A rapid increase in government revenues through implementing a more effective tax collecting system has been recommended. Implementing the proper reforms, is however estimated to be a slow process, requiring at least two legislative periods before they start to work. <ref name="Fakelaki">{{cite web|title=Griechenland: Abkehr von den Fakelaki

[[Transparency International]], an independent corruption monitoring [[NGO]], found that 13% of Greeks paid [[fakelaki]] (bribery in the form of envelopes with cash donations) in 2009, which was estimated to account for €787 million in yearly corruption payments. <ref name="Fakelaki"/> At the same time it was estimated that roughly €1 billion was paid by companies in bribes to public institutions for avoiding bureaucratic rules or to get other benefits. When calculating all sorts of corruption in Greece, the total amount is estimated to be roughly €3.5 billion per year (equal to 1.75% of the Greek GDP). Compared with corruption levels measured by Transparency International for 160 other countries, Greece ranked at 49th in 2004, was down at 57th in 2008, and slumped to 71st in 2009. <ref>{{cite web|title=Jede Menge Fakelaki in Griechenland |url=http://derstandard.at/1265851940139/Schmiergeld-Jede-Menge-Fakelaki-in-Griechenland |publisher=Der Standard| date=11 Februar 2010}}</ref>  The government elected in October 2009 had on its agenda to increase the fight against fakelaki and other forms of corruption. <ref name="Fakelaki"/>  .

=== Measures taken by the EU and IMF ===. 
==== First rescue package (May 2010) ====. 
Having had the credit rating agencies further downgraded Greece's ability to achieve and the risk premiums on long-term Greek government bonds first record levels, the Greek government requested on 23 April 2010 official financial assistance.  . 

The European Union (EU), European Central Bank (ECB) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed on 1–2 May 2010 with the Greek government to a three-year financial aid program (loan commitments) totaling €110 billion. The Greek debt in exchange for household should be consolidated within three years, so that the budget deficit should be reduced by 2014 to below 3 percent. <ref>[http://www.manager-magazin.de/geld/artikel/0,2828,690920,00.html manager-magazin 23. April 2010: Trotz Hilfe. Welche Risiken für Hellas bleiben]</ref> . 

Of the €110 billion promised by the IMF took €30bn, the Eurozone €80bn (as bilateral loan commitments). Instrumental in determining the rates of the individual euro area countries in the €80bn of the Eurozone was the respective equity interest in the capital of the ECB, which in turn is determined every five years after the prorated share of a country in the total population and economic output in the EU. The German share of the €80bn was 28%, or about €22.4bn in three years<ref name="spiegel_2010-5-9">[http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/0,1518,693884,00.html Spiegel-Online 9.

==== Second rescue package (July 2011 - February 2012) ====. 
;Early version - July 2011
Since the first rescue package proved insufficient, the 17 leaders of Euro countries approved a (preliminary) second rescue package at an EU summit on 21 July 2011. <ref name="SZ_2011-07-21">[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]], 21. Juli 2011: [http://www.sueddeutsche.de/geld/griechenland-einigung-beim-eu-gipfel-zum-abschluss-ein-laecheln-1.1123230 Zum Abschluss ein Lächeln]</ref> It was agreed that the aid package has a volume of €100 billion, provided by the newly created [[European Financial Stability Facility]]. The repayment period was extended from seven to 15 years and the interest rate was lowered to 3.5%. <ref name="tagesschau_2011-07-22">[[Tagesschau (Germany)|tagesschau.de]], 22. Juli 2011: [http://www.tagesschau.de/wirtschaft/gipfelergebnisse100.html ''Wie Griechenland gerettet werden soll'']</ref> . 

For the first time, this also included a private sector involvement, meaning that the private financial sector accepted a voluntary cut. It was agreed that the net contribution of banks and insurance companies to support Greece would include an additional €37 billion in 2014. <ref name="wiwo_2011-07-22">[[Wirtschaftswoche]], 22.

;EU summit - 26 October 2011
On the night of 26 to 27 October at the EU summit, the politicians made two important decisions to reduce the risk of a possible [[Financial contagion|contagion]] to other countries, in the case of a Greek default. The first decision was to require all European banks to achieve 9% [[Capital requirement|capitalization]], to make them strong enough to withstand those financial losses that potentially could erupt from a Greek default. The second decision was to [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]] the [[European Financial Stability Facility|EFSF]] from €500bn to €1&nbsp;trillion, as a firewall to protect financial stability in other Eurozone countries with a looming debt crisis. The leverage had previously been criticized from many sides,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blog.zeit.de/herdentrieb/2011/10/26/das-risiko-der-efsf-wird-jetzt-vervielfacht_3712 |title=Das Risiko des EFSF wird jetzt vervielfacht! |author=Fabian Lindner |source=blog.zeit.de |date=26 October 2011 |zugriff=2011-10-28}}</ref> because it is something taxpayers ultimately risk to pay for, due to the significantly increased risks assumed by the EFSF. <ref>{{cite news |hrsg=Financial Times Deutschland |url=http://www.ftd.de/politik/europa/:zustimmung-zum-rettungsschirm-was-der-bundestag-merkel-erlaubt/60120817.html |title=Zustimmung zum Rettungsschirm: Was der Bundestag Merkel erlaubt |datum=2011-10-25 |zugriff=2011-10-28}}</ref> . 

Furthermore, the Euro countries agreed on a plan to cut the debt of Greece from today's 160% to 120% of GDP by 2020. As part of that plan, it was proposed that all owners of Greek governmental bonds should "voluntarily" accept a 50% haircut of their bonds (resulting in a debt reduction worth €100bn), and moreover accept interest rates being reduced to only 3.5%. At the time of the summit, this was at first formally accepted by the government banks in Europe. The task to negotiate a final deal, also including the private creditors, was handed over to the Greek politicians.  . 

In view of the uncertainty of the domestic political development in Greece, the first disbursement was suspended after Prime Minister George Papandreou announced on 1 November 2011 that he wanted to hold a [[referendum]] on the decisions of the Euro summit. After two days of intense pressure, particularly from Germany and France, he finally gave up on the idea. On 11 November 2011 he was succeeded as prime minister by [[Loukas Papadimos]], who leads a new transitional government. The most important task of this interim government was to finalize the "haircut deal" for Greek governmental bonds and pass a new austerity package, to comply with the Troika requirements for receiving the second bailout loan worth €130bn (enhanced from the previously offered amount at €109bn).  . 

;Final agreement - February 2012
The Troika behind the second bailout package defined three requirements for Greece to comply with in order to receive the money. The first requirement was to finalize an agreement whereby all private holders of governmental bonds would accept a 50% haircut with yields reduced to 3.5%, thus facilitating a €100bn debt reduction for Greece. The second requirement was that Greece needed to implement another demanding austerity package in order to bring its budget deficit into sustainable territory. The third and final requirement was that a majority of the Greek politicians should sign an agreement guaranteeing their continued support for the new austerity package, even after the elections in April 2012. <ref name="bbc-2012-02-09"/> . 

On 21 February 2012, the Eurogroup finalized the second bailout package. In a thirteen-hour marathon meeting in Brussels, EU Member States agreed to a new €100 billion loan and a retroactive lowering of the bailout interest rates to a level of just 150 [[basis points]] above the [[Euribor]]. The IMF will provide "a significant contribution" to that loan but will only decide in the second week of March how much that will be. EU Member States will also pass on to Greece all profits which their [[European System of Central Banks|central banks]] made by buying Greek bonds at a debased rate until 2020. Private investors accepted a slightly bigger haircut of 53.5% of the [[face value]] of Greek governmental bonds,<ref name="second-bailout-agreement">{{cite news |url=http://consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ecofin/128075.pdf |title=Eurogroup statement |accessdate=21 February 2012 |publisher=Eurogroup |date=21 February 2012}}</ref> the equivalent to an overall loss of around 75%. <ref name="NYT-2012-02-21">{{cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/21/world/europe/agreement-close-on-a-bailout-for-greece-european-finance-ministers-say.html |title=Europe Agrees on New Bailout to Help Greece Avoid Default |accessdate=1 March 2012 |publisher=New York Times |date=20 February 2012}}</ref> It is the world's biggest debt restructuring deal, affecting some €206bn of bonds. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/29/us-europe-greece-idUSTRE81S0NP20120229 |title=Insight: How the Greek debt puzzle was solved |accessdate=29 February 2012 |publisher=Reuters |date=29 February 2012}}</ref> The creditors are invited to swap their current Greek bonds into new bonds with a maturity of between 11 and 30 years and lower average yields of 3.65% (2% for the first three years, 3% for the next five years, and 4.2% thereafter), thus facilitating a €100bn debt reduction for Greece. <ref name="second-bailout-agreement"/><ref name="2nd-bailout">{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/feb/21/greece-bailout-key-elements-deal |title=Greece bailout: six key elements of the deal |accessdate=21 February 2012 |publisher=Guardian |date=21 February 2012}}</ref> Euro-area Member States have pledged to contribute €30bn for private sector participation. <ref>{{cite document |titel=Erklärung des Euro-Gipfels |url=[http://consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/de/ec/125662.pdf PDF] |accessdate=28 October 2011 |source=Rat der Europäischen Union |title=Euro Summit Statement |language=en |year=2011|month=10|tag=26 |place=Brussels}}</ref> In case not enough bondholders agree to a voluntary bond swap, the Greek government has threatened to retroactively introduce a [[collective action clause]] to enforce participation. <ref name="SZ-Rettungspaket"/> .

On 3 March 2012, The [[Institute of International Finance]] said twelve of its steering committee would swap their bonds and accept a loss of up to 75%. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/2012/03/05/2698788/business-briefs-bondholders-agree.html |title=Bondholders agree to restructure Greek debt |work=[[The Sun News]] |date=5 March 2012 |accessdate=6 March 2012}}</ref> When all acceptances had been counted at March 9, and after the Greek parliament subsequently had decided to activate a collective action clause for the bonds covered by Greek law, the overall share of Greek government bonds to face a debt swap had reached 95.7% (equal to {{nowrap|€197 billion}}).

==== Speculation about a third rescue package ====. 
A ''Financial Times'' editorial on 22 February 2012 argued leaders had "proved themselves unable to settle on a solution that will not need to be revisited yet again", that at best the deal could only hope to remedy one part of the Greek disaster, namely the country's debilitated public finances, though it would not likely even do that. <ref name="FTed 22Feb2012"/> The eurozone's latest plan did, at least, evince consistency with the currency block's previous behaviour:
{{quote|from the start, its approach has been a halfway house of resisting a sovereign default but not doing enough to remove the risk altogether. The reason is obvious: core governments find it politically impossible to put up more money. So it is unfathomable that they did not demand more from private creditors. The debt restructuring leaves Greece and its helpers with €100bn of debt that could have been written down entirely and left funds to address future "accidents" without resorting to a third rescue. If there is another showdown with Greece it will have been caused by this. <ref name="FTed 22Feb2012">{{cite news |url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2f16a2b2-5c8a-11e1-911f-00144feabdc0.html |title= Greek rescue is still a halfway house |author= Editorial |date= 22 February 2012 |newspaper= Financial Times |page= 12 |accessdate= 28 March 2012}}</ref>}}
The German finance minister [[Wolfgang Schäuble]] and [[Eurogroup]] president [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] shared the scepticism, and did not rule out a third bailout. <ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2012/0225/1224312374474.html | title=Schäuble concedes third Greek bailout on the cards | publisher=Irish Times | date=25 February 2012 | accessdate=1 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/24/us-greece-juncker-idUSTRE81N20Q20120224 | title=Eurogroup head cannot rule out third Greek bailout | publisher=Reuters | date=24 February 2012 | accessdate=21 February 2012}}</ref> According to a leaked official report from the European Commission, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Greece may need another €50 billion ($66bn) from 2015 to 2020. <ref name="NYT-2012-02-21"/> The second bailout's programme began veering off course before it even began. A ''Financial Times'' review of the bailout report noted an assumption that Greece's economy shrank by 6.9% during 2011, but Athens duly announced the shrinkage had actually been 7.5%. "It wouldn't be the first time a Greek bailout failed to live up to optimistic expectations", concluded the newspaper. <ref name="PS 14Mar2012">{{cite web |url= http://blogs.ft.com/brusselsblog/2012/03/just-how-big-is-greeces-new-bailout-really/ |title= Just how big is Greece’s new bailout, really? |author= Peter Spiegel |date= 14 March 2012 |work= Brussels blog |publisher= FT.com |accessdate= 2 April 2012 }}</ref> .

In exchange for European funding Greece was forced to impose strict fiscal austerity. <ref>{{cite web| title = Greece announces new austerity measures | url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-03/03/c_13196072.htm | publisher=Xinhua | date = 010-03-03 | accessdate =2 May 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title =The PIIGS Problem: Maginot Line Economics | url = http://www.newdeal20.org/2010/04/12/the-piigs-problem-maginot-line-economics-9697/ | publisher=New Deal 2.0 | date = 04/12/2010 | accessdate =2 May 2010 }}</ref> As early as 2010 some economists expressed fears that the negative impact of tighter fiscal policy could offset the positive impact of lower borrowing costs and social disruption could have a significantly negative impact on investment and growth in the longer term.

According to an IMF official austerity measures have helped Greece bring down its ''primary deficit before interest payments'', from €24.7bn (10.6% of GDP) in 2009 to just €5.2bn (2.4% of GDP) in 2011,<ref name="IMF-2012"/><ref name="SZ-staat-neu"/> but as a side-effect they also contributed to a worsening of the Greek recession, which began in October 2008 and only became worse in 2010 and 2011. <ref name="National Accounts"/> Overall the Greek GDP had its worst decline in 2011 with -6.9%,<ref name="EU interim economic forecast for 2012"/> a year where the seasonal adjusted industrial output ended 28.4% lower than in 2005,<ref name="Eurostat -industrial production 2011"/><ref name="guardian-block20"/> and with 111,000 Greek companies going bankrupt (27% higher than in 2010). <ref name="Companies going bankrupt in 2011"/><ref name="Drop in budget revenues"/> As a result, the seasonal adjusted unemployment rate also grew from 7.5% in September 2008 to a record high of 19.9% in November 2011, while the Youth unemployment rate during the same time rose from 22.0% to as high as 48.1%. <ref name="Eurostat-unemployment"/><ref name="google-unemployment-data"/>{{quote|In an economy without a welfare regime to speak of, the impact of five consecutive years of recession has taken its toll.

==The German dimension==. 
Germany has played a major role in every discussion to do with the Greek debt crisis. This is understandable given that the country was Greece's biggest creditor going into the maelstrom, but the Germans have come under heavy fire for the 'recovery' programme they have helped foist on Greece, and for being more interested in protecting their national interests than solving the crisis and making the adjustments necessary for the Mediterranean country to recover. <ref name="DaGr 13Mar2012">{{cite web |url= http://www.europeanstrategist.eu/2012/03/germany-and-the-crisis-of-the-periphery/ |title= Germany and the crisis of the periphery |author= David Grodzki |date= 13 March 2012 |work= The European Strategist |accessdate= 1 April 2012 }}</ref> "Germany is coming across like a know-it-all in the debate over aid for Greece", commented ''[[Der Spiegel]]'',<ref name="SpOn 21Jun2011"/> though German economic historian Albrecht Ritschl describes his country as "king when it comes to debt.

Since the euro came into circulation in 2002—a time when the country was suffering slow growth and high unemployment—Germany's export performance, coupled with sustained pressure for moderate wage increases and rapidly rising wage increases elsewhere, have provided German exporters with the competitive advantage to dominate trade and capital flows within the currency block, making the country the primary beneficiary of the euro. <ref name="YoSe 2011">{{cite journal |last1= Young |first1= Brigitte |last2= Semmler |first2= Willi |year= 2011 |title= The European Sovereign Debt Crisis: Is Germany to Blame? |journal= German Politics and Society |volume= 29 |issue= 1 |doi= 10.3167/gps.2011.290101 |accessdate= 1 April 2012 }}</ref> Germany's total export trade value nearly tripled between 2000 and 2007, though a significant proportion of this is accounted for by trade with China,<ref name="DaGr 13Mar2012"/> while its wages increased more slowly than any other EU nation. <ref name="YoSe 2011"/> As a result, peripheral countries had been losing competitiveness relative to Germany, running trade deficits with it, and showed large current account deficits. <ref name="YoSe 2011"/> .

==Hedgefunds==. 
Though it was largely foreign banks, represented in the various talks by the Institute of International Finance, who originally held Greek [[government bonds]] they had so recklessly bought, by the time of the February 2012 negotiations they had sold on perhaps half their holdings, largely to hedge funds and other investors not represented at the talks. In February, hedge funds were thought to control 25–30% of Greek bonds, and are widely believed to be unwilling to participate in any voluntary debt reduction, complicating any deal. Their reluctance to take hair-cuts stems from their reckoned investment strategy, which would bring profit from a formal default on Greek bonds via a pay-out from the [[Credit default swap|bond insurance]]. To neuter the hedge-fund veto on negotiations, the Greek government was expected to pass retroactive legal provisions to allow it to force a restructuring on bondholders. An imposed deal, however, would apparently trigger CDS payments, <ref name="Dex 22Feb2012">{{cite web |url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/07eb2490-5cb9-11e1-8f1f-00144feabdc0.html |title= Harsher terms leave a 'bitter taste in mouth' for bondholders |author1= Patrick Jenkins |author2= Richard Milne |author3= Peter Spiegel |date= 21 February 2012 |publisher= FT.com |accessdate= 29 March 2012}}</ref> the Greek case might be more complicated than Argentina, putting some investors off.

==Analysis of the restructuring==. 
In March, [[Nouriel Roubini]] ruminated: "A myth is developing that private creditors have accepted significant losses in the restructuring of Greece's debt, while the official sector gets off scot free. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The reality is that most of the gains in good times .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. were privatised while most of the losses have been now socialised. Taxpayers of Greece's official creditors, not private bondholders, will end up paying for most of the losses deriving from Greece's past, current and future insolvency."{{quote|Greece's public debt will [remain] unsustainable at close to 140 per cent of gross domestic product: at best, it will fall to 120 per cent by 2020 and could rise as high as 160 per cent of GDP. Why? A "haircut" of €110bn on privately held bonds is matched by an increase of €130bn in the debt Greece owes to official creditors. A significant part of this increase in Greece’s official debt goes to bail out private creditors: €30bn for upfront cash sweeteners on the new bonds that effectively guarantee much of their face value. Any future further haircuts to make Greek debt sustainable will therefore fall disproportionately on the growing claims of the official sector. Loans of at least €25bn from the European Financial Stability Facility to the Greek government will go towards recapitalising banks in a scheme that will keep those banks in private hands and allow shareholders to buy back any public capital injection with sweetly priced warrants. The new bonds will also be subject to English law, where the old bonds fell under Greek jurisdiction. So if Greece were to leave the eurozone, it could no longer pass legislation to convert euro-denominated debt into new drachma debt.

One estimate is that Greece actually subscribed to €156bn worth of new debt in order to get €206bn worth of old debt to be written off, meaning the trumpeted write-down of €110bn by the banks and others is more than double the true figure of €50bn that was truly written off. Taxpayers are now liable for more than 80% of Greece's debt. <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.social-europe.eu/2012/03/the-mystery-tour-of-restructuring-greek-sovereign-debt/ |title= The Mystery Tour of Restructuring Greek Sovereign Debt |author= Ronald Janssen |date= 28 March 2012 |publisher= Social Europe Journal |accessdate= 2 April 2012 }}</ref> According to [[Robert Reich]], in the background of the Greek bailouts and debt restructuring lurks [[Wall Street]]. While US banks are owed only about €5bn by Greece, they have more significant exposure to the situation via German and French banks, who ''were'' significantly exposed to Greek debt. Massively reducing the liabilities of German and French banks with regards to Greece thus also serves to protect US banks. <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.social-europe.eu/2011/10/follow-the-money-behind-europes-debt-crisis-lurks-another-giant-bailout-of-wall-street/ |title= Follow the Money: Behind Europe's Debt Crisis Lurks Another Giant Bailout of Wall Street |author=Robert Reich |date= 10 May 2011 |publisher= Social Europe Journal |accessdate= 2 April 2012 }}</ref> . 

==Public opinion==. 
According to a poll by Public Issue and SKAI Channel, PASOK—who won the national elections of 2009 with 43.92% of the vote—has seen its approval rating decimated to a mere 8%, placing it fifth after right-wing New Democracy (31%), left-wing Democratic Left (18%), left-wing Communist Party of Greece (KKE) (12.5%) and left-wing SYRIZA (12%). The same poll suggested that [[George Papandreou|Papanderou]] is the least popular political leader with a 9% approval rating, while 71% of Greeks do not trust [[Lucas Papademos|Papademos]] as prime minister. <ref name="PollFeb2012">{{cite web|title=Poll Feb2012|url=http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/193925/antigrafotouvarometro-neo-politiko-skiniko-me-okto-kommata-sti-vouli-/|accessdate=14 Feb 2012|date=14 Feb 2012}}</ref> . 

In a poll published on 18 May 2011, 62% of the people questioned felt the [[IMF]] memorandum that Greece signed in 2010 was a bad decision that hurt the country, while 80% had no faith in the [[Minister for Finance (Greece)|Minister of Finance]], [[Giorgos Papakonstantinou]], to handle the crisis. <ref name="Public Issue">{{cite web|title=Mνημόνιο ένα χρόνο μετά: Aποδοκιμασία, αγανάκτηση, απαξίωση, ανασφάλεια (One Year after the Memorandum: Disapproval, Anger, Disdain, Insecurity)|url=http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/169875/mnimonio-ena-hrono-meta-apodokimasia-aganaktisi-apaxiosi-anasfaleia|publisher=skai.gr|accessdate=18 May 2011|date=18 May 2011}}</ref> [[Evangelos Venizelos]] replaced Mr. Papakonstantinou on 17 June. 75% of those polled gave a negative image of the [[IMF]], and 65% feel it is hurting Greece's economy. <ref name="Public Issue" /> 64% felt that the possibility of sovereign default is likely. When asked about their fears for the near future, Greeks highlighted unemployment (97%), poverty (93%) and the closure of businesses (92%). <ref name="Public Issue" /> . 

Polls have shown that, despite the awful sitution, the vast majority of Greeks are not in favour of leaving the eurozone,<ref name="Helena Smith"/> a fact attributed by some to there having been "so much propaganda over the years about the merits of the euro and the perils of being outside it that both expert and popular opinion can barely see straight. It is true that default and a euro exit could endanger Greece's continued membership of the EU. More importantly, though, there is a strong element of national pride. For Greece to leave the euro would seem like a national humiliation. Mind you, quite how agreeing to decades of misery under German subjugation allows Greeks to hold their heads high defeats me."<ref name="RB 26Feb2012"/> . 

==Call for debt audit commission==. 
In the documentary [[Debtocracy]] made by a group of Greek journalists, it is argued that Greece should create an audit commission, and force bondholders to suffer from losses, like Ecuador did.  . 

== Speculation about Euro exit ==. 
Economists, mostly from outside Europe, and associated with [[Modern Monetary Theory]] and other [[post-Keynesian]] schools condemned the design of the Euro currency system from the beginning <ref name=Wray2011>{{cite web|last=Wray|first=L.

If Greece remains in the euro while accepting higher bond yields, reflecting its high government deficit, then high interest rates would dampen demand, raise savings and slow the economy. An improved trade performance and less reliance on foreign capital would be the result.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} . 

However, German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] and French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] have said on numerous occasions that they would not allow the eurozone to disintegrate and have linked the survival of the Euro with that of the entire [[European Union]]. <ref>{{cite news|last=Czuczka |first=Tony |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-02-04/merkel-makes-euro-indispensable-turning-crisis-into-opportunity.html |title=Merkel makes Euro Indispensable Turning Crisis into Opportunity |work=Bloomberg Businessweek |date=4 February 2011 |accessdate=9 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=MacCormaic |first=Ruadhan |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2011/1209/1224308800810.html |title=EU risks being split apart, says Sarkozy |work=Irish Times |date=9 December 2011 |accessdate=9 December 2011}}</ref> In September 2011, EU commissioner [[Joaquín Almunia]] shared this view, saying that expelling weaker countries from the euro was not an option: "Those who think that this hypothesis is possible just do not understand our process of integration". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/19/113568 |title=Spanish commissioner lashes out at core eurozone states |publisher=EUobserver |date=9 September 2011 |accessdate=15 September 2011}}</ref> .
