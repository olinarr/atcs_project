In [[economics]], '''austerity''' is a [[Economic policy|policy]] of [[Government budget deficit|deficit]]-cutting, lower [[Government spending|spending]], and a reduction in the amount of [[Welfare|benefits]] and [[public services]] provided. <ref name="Elmhirst">{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/ideas/2010/09/austerity-word-red-conference|title=Word Games: Austerity|last=Elmhirst|first=Sophie|date=24 September 2010|publisher=New Statesman|accessdate=29 September 2010}}</ref> Austerity policies are often used by governments to reduce their [[deficit spending]]<ref name="Traynor">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/jun/11/europe-deficit-crisis-austerity-budgets|title=Austerity Europe: who faces the cuts|last=Traynor|first=Ian|coauthors=Katie Allen|date=11 June 2010|publisher=Guardian News|accessdate=29 September 2010|location=London}}</ref> while sometimes coupled with increases in [[tax]]es to pay back [[creditor]]s to reduce debt. <ref name="Wesbury">{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2010/07/26/government-spending-taxes-opinions-columnists-brian-wesbury-robert-stein.html|title=Government Austerity: The Good, Bad And Ugly|last=Wesbury|first=Brian S.|coauthors=Robert Stein|date=26 July 2010|publisher=Forbes.com|accessdate=29 September 2010}}</ref> "Austerity" was named the word of the year by [[Merriam-Webster]] in 2010. <ref>{{cite web|title=Word of the Year 2010|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/info/10words.htm|publisher=Merriam-Webster}}</ref> . 

The [[Expansionary fiscal contraction]] hypothesis is the economic theory that explores whether government austerity can result in economic expansion.  This hypothesis and real world data analysis indicate that expansion from austerity is very limited and occurs only during periods when consumption is not constrained.  . 

==Reasons for taking austerity measures==. 
Austerity measures are typically taken if there is a threat that a government cannot honor its debt liabilities. Such a situation may arise if a government has borrowed in foreign currencies that they have no right to issue or they have been legally forbidden from issuing their own currency. In such a situation, banks may lose trust in a government's ability and/or willingness to pay and either refuse to roll over existing debts or demand extremely high interest rates. In such situations, inter-governmental institutions such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) may demand austerity measures in exchange for functioning as a lender of last resort. When the IMF requires such a policy, the terms are known as 'IMF [[conditionality|conditionalities]]'.  . 

==Typical effects==. 
[[Economic development|Development]] projects, [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]], and other social spending are common programs that are targeted for cuts. [[Taxes]], port and airport fees, and train and bus fares are common sources of increased user fees.  . 

In many cases, austerity measures have been associated with protest movements claiming significant decline in standard of living. A case in point is the nation of Greece. The financial crisis—particularly the austerity package put forth by the EU and the IMF— was met with great anger by the Greek public, leading to riots and social unrest. On 27 June 2011, trade union organizations commenced a forty-eight hour labor strike in advance of a parliamentary vote on the austerity package, the first such strike since 1974. Massive demonstrations were organized throughout Greece, intended to pressure parliament members into voting against the package. The second set of austerity measures was approved on 29 June 2011, with 155 out of 300 members of parliament voting in favor. However, one [[United Nations]] official warned that the second package of austerity measures in Greece could pose a violation of [[human rights]]. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38901&Cr=austerity&Cr1= |title=Greek austerity measures could violate human rights, UN expert says |date=30 June 2011 |publisher=www.un.org |accessdate=3 July 2011}}</ref> . 

==Controversy==. 
{{main|Anti-austerity protests}}
Austerity programs can be controversial, as they tend to have an adverse impact on the poorest segments of the population.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} In many situations, austerity programs are implemented by countries that were previously under dictatorial regimes, leading to criticism that the citizens are forced to repay the debts of their oppressors. <ref>Harvey, D (2005) ''A Brief History of Neoliberalism''</ref><ref>Klein, N. (2007) ''The Shock Doctrine''</ref><ref>Chomsky, N (2004) ''Hegemony or Survival''</ref> . 

Economist [[Richard D. Wolff]] has stated that instead of cutting government programs and raising taxes, austerity should be attained by collecting (taxes) from [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[multinational corporation]]s, churches, and private tax-exempt institutions such as universities, which currently pay no taxes at all. <ref name="Wolff">{{cite web|url=http://www.rdwolff.com/content/austerity-why-and-whom|title=Austerity: Why and for Whom?|last=Wolff|first=Richard|date=4 July 2010|publisher=RDWolff.com|accessdate=29 September 2010}}</ref> . 

In 2009, 2010, and 2011, workers and students in Greece and other European countries demonstrated against cuts to pensions, public services and education spending as a result of [[government]] austerity measures. <ref name="Thestar">{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/business/article/802042|title=In Greece you get a bonus for showing up for work - Arcane benefits add billions to Greece’s bloated budget|last=Kyriakidou|first=Dina|date=4 August 2010|publisher=thestar.com|accessdate=29 September 2010|location=Toronto}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Costas Kantouris and Nicholas Paphitis |title=Greek police, firefighters protest |date=10 September 10 2011 |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] Sm,meme,emme,e,e,e

Following the announcement of plans to introduce austerity measures in Greece, massive demonstrations were witnessed throughout the country, aimed at pressing parliamentarians to vote against the austerity package. In Athens alone 19 arrests were made while 46 civilians and 38 policemen had been injured by June 29, 2011. the third round austerity has been approved by the Greece parliament on February 12, 2012 and has met strong opposition especially in the cities of Athens and Thessaloniki where the police have clashed with demonstrators.  . 

Opponents argue that austerity measures tend to depress economic growth, which ultimately causes governments to lose more money in tax revenues. In countries with already anemic economic growth, austerity can engender deflation which inflates existing debt. This can also cause the country to fall into a [[liquidity trap]], causing credit markets to freeze up and unemployment to increase. Opponents point to cases in Ireland and Spain in which austerity measures instituted in response to financial crises in 2009 proved ineffective in combating public debt, and placing those countries at risk of defaulting in late 2010. <ref>{{cite news|last=Leung |first=Sophie |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-11/stiglitz-says-ireland-has-bleak-prospect-of-cutting-deficit-saving-banks.html |title=Stiglitz Says Ireland Has Bleak Prospect of Cutting Deficit, Saving Banks |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2010-11-11 |accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref> . 

==The "Age of Austerity"==. 
The term “[[Age of austerity]]” was popularized by British Conservative leader [[David Cameron]] in his keynote speech to the Conservative party forum in Cheltenham on April 26, 2009, when he [[United Kingdom Conservative-Liberal coalition government austerity programme|committed]] to put an end to years of excessive government spending. <ref>{{Cite news|author=Deborah Summers |title= David Cameron warns of 'new age of austerity'

==Word of the year==. 
[[Merriam-Webster's Dictionary]] named the word "austerity" as its "Word of the Year" for 2010 because of the number of web searches this word generated that year. According to the president and publisher of the dictionary, "austerity had more than 250,000 searches on the dictionary's free online [website] tool" and the spike in searches "came with more coverage of the debt crisis". <ref>{{cite news |url= http://www2.timesdispatch.com/news/2010/dec/20/audacity-austerity-2010-word-year-ar-727040/ |title= Audacity of 'austerity,' 2010 Word of the Year |last1= Contreras|first1= Russell |last2= |first2= |date= December 20, 2010 |agency= Associated Press|publisher= |accessdate= December 20, 2010}}{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref> .
