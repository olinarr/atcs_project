'''International reaction to the [[2007 Burmese anti-government protests]]''' ranges from support of the protestors through neutrality to support of the [[State Peace and Development Council]], the ruling junta. While most countries supported the protests and urged the [[Myanmar]]'s [[State Peace and Development Council]] ruling [[military Junta]] to implement far-reaching reforms, several key countries, such as the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[India]] maintained commitment to the notion of [[Non-interference (security)|noninterference]]. A number of protests against the Burmese Government's crackdown have been held worldwide.  .
