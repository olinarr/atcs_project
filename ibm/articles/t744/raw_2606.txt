{{Politics of Burma}}
'''Burma's foreign relations''' with many states are strained, mainly due to its [[Human rights in Burma|human rights record]]. Burma (officially the '''Republic of the Union of Myanmar'''), is sometimes considered an isolationist state. However, it generally shares closer connections with some of its neighbor states, and it is a member of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]].  . 

The [[Government of Burma|Burmese government]] continues to adopt an independent, [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] foreign policy. <ref>[http://www.mofa.gov.mm/foreignpolicy/emergence.html Foreign Policy : Emergence of Foreign Policy]. Foreign Ministry of Myanmar</ref> . 

== European Union and the United States ==. 
The United States has placed broad sanctions on Burma because of the [[8888 Uprising|military crackdown in 1988]] and the military regime's refusal to honour the [[Burmese general election, 1990|election results of the 1990]] People's Assembly election. Similarly, the [[European Union]] has placed embargoes on Burma, including an arms embargo, cessation of trade preferences, and suspension of all aid with the exception of [[humanitarian aid]]. <ref name="EU">{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/comm/external_relations/myanmar/intro/index.htm |title= The EU's relations with Burma / Myanmar |accessdate=2006-07-13 |publisher=[[European Union]]|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060725000750/http%3A//ec.europa.eu/comm/external_relations/myanmar/intro/index.htm |archivedate = July 25, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref> . 

US and European government sanctions against the military government, coupled with boycotts and other direct pressure on corporations by western supporters of the Burmese democracy movement, have resulted in the withdrawal from Burma of most U.S. and many European companies. However, several Western companies remain due to loopholes in the sanctions. <ref>[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=3986 The List: Burma’s Economic Lifelines]. ''[[Foreign Policy]]''. October 2007</ref> Asian corporations have generally remained willing to continue investing in Burma and to initiate new investments, particularly in [[natural resource]] extraction.  . 

The French oil company [[Total S.A.]] is able to operate the [[Yadana Project|Yadana natural gas pipeline]] from Burma to Thailand despite the [[European Union]]'s sanctions on Burma. Total is currently the subject of a lawsuit in French and Belgian courts for the condoning and use of Burman civilian slavery to construct the named pipeline. Experts say that the human rights abuses along the gas pipeline are the direct responsibility of Total S.A. and its American partner [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] with aid and implementation by the [[Tatmadaw]]. Prior to its acquisition by [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], [[Unocal]] settled a similar human rights lawsuit for a reported multi-million dollar amount. <ref>{{cite news|last=Horsley |first=William |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3761022.stm |title=Dilemma of dealing with Burma |publisher=BBC News|date=2004-10-20 |accessdate=2004-11-02 }}</ref> There remains active debate as to the extent to which the American-led sanctions have had adverse effects on the civilian population or on the military rulers. <ref>{{cite news|last=Hiatt |first=Fred |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&contentId=A21505-2003Jun22 |title=How Best to Rid the World of Monsters |publisher=Washington Post|date=2003-06-23 |accessdate=2006-05-24 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/reg.burma/archives/199905/msg00184.html |title=Reuters Belgian group seeks Total boycott over Myanmar |work=Ibiblio |publisher=Reuters |date=1999-05-10 |accessdate=2006-06-24 }}</ref> . 

===Ireland===. 
The Government of [[Ireland]] established diplomatic relations with Burma on a non-resident basis on 10 February 2006. The Irish Government was still concerned by the continued detention of the opposition leader [[Aung San Suu Kyi]]. <ref>[http://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=25837 Department of Foreign Affairs - Ireland establishes diplomatic relations with Myanmar (Burma)]</ref> Burma Action Ireland is a pro-democracy group that freely operates in the Irish Republic. <ref>[http://www.burmaactionireland.org/cont.html Burma Action Ireland]</ref><ref>[http://www.indymedia.ie/article/88630 Free Burma - Indymedia Ireland]</ref> . 

Ireland supported a UN commission of inquiry and international level monitoring of the situation in Burma after 2008, as part of their efforts to support the Burmese people in their struggle for democracy and human rights. This became public knowledge after official papers were leaked in September 2010. <ref>[http://www.mizzima.com/news/world/4405-ireland-weighs-in-on-un-inquiry-into-burma-abuses.html Ireland weighs in on UN inquiry into Burma abuses]</ref> . 

===France===. 
{{main|Burma–France relations}}
Franco-Burmese relations go back to the early 18th century, as the [[French East India Company]] attempted to extend its influence into Southeast Asia. French involvement started in 1729 when it built a shipyard in the city of [[Thanlyin|Syriam]]. <ref>South (2003), p. 79</ref> The 1740 revolt of the [[Mon State|Mon]] against Burmese rule, however, forced the French to depart in 1742. <ref>Liang (1990), p. 14</ref> They were able to return to [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] in 1751 when the Mon requested French assistance against the Burmese. A French envoy, [[Sieur de Bruno]] was sent to evaluate the situation and help in the defence against the Burmese. French warships were sent to support the Mon rebellion, but in vain. In 1756, the Burmese under [[Alaungpaya]] vanquished the Mon. Many French were captured and incorporated into the Burmese Army as an elite gunner corps, under [[Chevalier Milard]]. In 1769, official contacts resumed when a trade treaty was signed between [[Hsinbyushin|King Hsinbyushin]] and the French East India Company. <ref>Bhuyan (1974), p. 460</ref> . 

Soon after, however, France was convulsed by the [[French Revolution]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]], thus allowing overwhelming British influence in Burma. French contacts with Burma, effectively a British colony, became almost non-existent. Instead, from the second half of the 19th century, France concentrated on the establishment of [[French Indochina]] and the conflicts with China leading to the [[Sino-French War]]. Following the end of [[World War II]], ambassador-level diplomatic relationships between France and Burma were established in 1948, soon after the Burmese nation became an independent republic on January 4, 1948, as ''Union of Burma'', with [[Sao Shwe Thaik]] as its first President and [[U Nu]] as its first [[Prime Minister of Burma|Prime Minister]].  . 

==North America==. 
===United States===. 
{{Refimprove|date=April 2011}}
The political '''[[Diplomatic relationship|relationship]] between the [[United States]] and [[Burma]]''' worsened after the 1988 military [[coup]] and violent suppression of pro-[[democracy]] [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]].  Subsequent repression, including the crackdown on peaceful [[protestor]]s in September 2007, further strained the relationship. However, following signs of liberalization, the US government began the process of improving its links with Burma in 2011. <ref name="NYTimes.com">{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/02/world/asia/us-will-relax-curbs-on-aid-to-myanmar.html | work=The New York Times | title=Clinton Says U.S. Will Relax Some Curbs on Aid to Myanmar | date=1 December 2011}}</ref> . 

==== History ====. 
Massachusetts attempted to [[Massachusetts Burma Law|sanction Burma directly]] in 1996 but those efforts proved unconstitutional. Later, the United States federal government has imposed broad sanctions against Burma under several different legislative and policy vehicles. The [[Burma Freedom and Democracy Act]] (BFDA), passed by Congress and signed by the President in 2003, includes a ban on all [[import]]s from Burma, a ban on the [[export]] of financial services to Burma, a freeze on the assets of certain Burmese financial institutions, and extended [[Visa (document)|visa]] restrictions on Burmese officials. Congress has renewed the BFDA annually, most recently in July 2010. <ref>[http://democracyforburma.wordpress.com/2010/07/23/burmese-freedom-and-democracy-act-passed-both-houses-of-congress-with-more-support-than-in-any-other-year/ Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act passed both Houses of Congress.]</ref>
[[File:Embassy of Myanmar, Washington.jpg|thumb|righ|175px|Embassy of Burma in [[Washington, D.C.]].]] . 

Since September 27, 2007, the U.S. Department of Treasury designated 25 senior Burmese government officials as subject to an asset block under Executive Order 13310. On October 19, 2007, President [[George W. Bush]] announced a new Executive Order (E.O. 13448) which expands the authority to block assets to individuals who are responsible for [[human rights]] abuses and public corruption, as well as those who provide material and financial support to the regime.  . 

In addition, since May 1997, the U.S. Government has prohibited new [[investment]] by U.S. persons or entities. A number of U.S. companies exited the Burma market even prior to the imposition of sanctions due to a worsening business climate and mounting criticism from human rights groups, consumers, and shareholders. The United States has also imposed countermeasures on Burma due to its inadequate measures to eliminate [[money laundering]].  . 

Due to its particularly severe violations of [[religious freedom]], the United States has designated Burma a [[Country of Particular Concern]] (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act. Burma is also designated a Tier 3 Country in the Trafficking in Persons Report for its use of [[forced labour]], and is subject to additional sanctions as a result. The political relationship between the [[United States]] and Burma worsened after the 1988 military coup and violent suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations. Subsequent repression, including the brutal crackdown on peaceful protestors in September 2007, further strained the relationship.  . 

The United States downgraded its level of representation in Burma from [[Ambassador]] to [[Chargé d'Affaires]] after the government's crackdown on the democratic opposition in 1988 and its failure to honour the results of the 1990 parliamentary election.  . 

====Recent moves====. 
US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, visited Burma in November–December 2011. In this visit, the first by a Secretary of State since 1955, Clinton met with the President of Burma, Thein Sein, in the capital Naypyidaw, and later met with democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi in Yangon. The US announced a relaxation of curbs on aid and raised the possibility of an exchange of ambassadors. <ref name="NYTimes.com"/> . 

On the 13th of January 2012, the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced the US will exchange ambassadors with Burma, after a landmark Burmese political prisoner amnesty. <ref>British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)– US to exchange ambassadors with Burma, <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16554415>.

{{main|Burma–Russia relations}}
Bilateral relations with the [[Russian Federation]] are the strongest{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} enjoyed by largely isolated Burma. Russia had established diplomatic relations with Burma at independence and these continued after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]]. China and Russia once vetoed a [[U.N. Security Council]] resolution designed to punish Burma. <ref name="BBC">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7011746.stm Chinese dilemma over Burma] (25 September 2007). BBC.

==Association of Southeast Asian Nations==. 
Burma is a member of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) and part of [[ASEAN+3]] and the [[East Asia Summit]]. While Burma's presence in ASEAN was seen as a test of the organisation's philosophy of [[constructive engagement]], the presence of Burma in ASEAN however has started to be seen as an embarrassment to the organisation, because of Burma's human rights record and lack of democracy. <ref>[http://www.thejakartapost.com/yesterdaydetail.asp?fileid=20060301.B01 JK Post].

Asean will not defend Burma at any international forum following the military regime's refusal to restore democracy. In April 2007, the Malaysian Foreign Ministry parliamentary secretary [[Ahmad Shabery Cheek]] said Malaysia and other Asean members had decided not to defend Burma if the country was raised for discussion at any international conference. "Now Burma has to defend itself if it was bombarded at any international forum," he said when winding up a debate at committee stage for the Foreign Ministry. He was replying to queries from Opposition Leader [[Lim Kit Siang]] on the next course of action to be taken by Malaysia and Asean with the Burmese military junta. Lim had said Malaysia must play a proactive role in pursuing regional initiatives to bring about a change in Burma and support efforts to bring the situation in Burma to the [[UN Security Council]]'s attention. <ref>{{cite news|title=Asean Will Not Defend Myanmar At International Fora - Ahmad Shabery |publisher=Bernama|date=2007-04-19 |accessdate=2007-04-23 }}</ref> Recently, ASEAN did take a stronger tone with Burma, particularly regards to the detention of now-released [[Aung San Suu Kyi]]. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8056852.stm Asian leaders condemn Burma trial].

{{main|Burma–India relations}}
'''Bilateral relations''' between [[Burma]] (officially the [[Union of Myanmar]]) and the [[Republic of India]] have improved considerably since 1993, overcoming strains over [[drug trafficking]], the suppression of democracy and the rule of the [[State Peace and Development Council|military junta]] in Burma. Burma is situated to the south of the states of [[Mizoram]], [[Manipur]], [[Nagaland]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] in [[Northeast India]]. The proximity of the [[People's Republic of China]] give strategic importance to Indo-Burmese relations. The Indo-Burmese border stretches over 1,600&nbsp;kilometers. <ref name="VJ">[http://www.atimes.com/reports/CB21Ai01.html#top5 Myanmar shows India the road to Southeast Asia]</ref> India is generally friendly with Burma, but is concerned by the flow of tribal refugees and the arrest of [[Aung San Suu Kyi]].  . 

As a result of increased Chinese influence in Burma as well as the safe haven and [[arms trafficking]] occurring along the Indo-Burmese border, [[India]] has sought in recent years to shore up ties with the military junta. <ref>Jagan, Larry.

=== Covert military activities in Burma ===. 
'''Operation ''Leech''''' is the name given to an armed operation on the Indo-Burmese border in 1998. As the major player in South Asia, India always sought to promote democracy and install friendly governments in the region. To these ends, India's external [[intelligence agency]], [[R&AW]], cultivated Burmese rebel groups and pro-democracy coalitions, especially the [[Kachin Independence Army]] (KIA). <ref>Larry Jagan, [[BBC]] Online, 4 July 2000</ref> [[India]] allowed the KIA to carry a limited trade in [[jade]] and precious stones using Indian territory and even supplied them with weapons. It is further alleged that KIA chief [[Maran Brang Seng]] met the R&AW chief in Delhi twice.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} . 

However, with increasing bonhomie between the Indian government and the Burma [[Military dictatorship|junta]] and KIA becoming the main source of training and weapons for all northeastern rebel groups, R&AW initiated Operation ''Leech'', with the help of [[Indian Army|Army]] and paramilitary forces, to [[assassination|assassinate]] the leaders of the Burmese rebels as an example to other groups. <ref>Subir Bhaumik (June 2005).

===People's Republic of China===. 
{{Main|Burma – People's Republic of China relations}}
The [[People's Republic of China]] had poor relations with Burma until the late 1980s. Between 1967 and 1970, Burma broke relations with Beijing because of the latter's support for the [[Communist Party of Burma]] (CPB). <ref name=singh>Singh (2003)</ref> [[Deng Xiaoping]] visited [[Yangon]] in 1978 and withdrew support for the long running insurgency of the [[Communist Party of Burma]]. <ref name=singh/> However, in the early 1950s Burma enjoyed a hot-and-cold relationship with China. Burma's [[U Thant]] and [[U Nu]] lobbied for China's entry as a permanent member into the [[Security Council]], but denounced the [[Invasion of Tibet (1950–1951)|invasion of Tibet]]. <ref>Bingham (1966), p. 9</ref> . 

China and Burma have had many border disputes, dating long before the British annexation of Burma. The last border dispute culminated in 1956, when the [[People's Liberation Army]] invaded northern Burma, but were repulsed. <ref>Silverstein (1980), p. 209</ref> A border agreement was reached in 1960. <ref>Laqueur (1974), p. 67</ref> . 

In the late 1960s, due to [[Ne Win]]'s propaganda that the Chinese were responsible for crop failures, and the increasing number of ethnic Chinese students supporting [[Mao Zedong]], by carrying the [[Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong]] books, anti-Chinese riots broke out in June 1967. <ref>Seekins (2006), p. 141</ref> At the same time, many Sino-Burmese were influenced by the [[Cultural Revolution]] in China and began to wear [[Chairman Mao badge|Mao badges]]. <ref>Lintner (1990), p. 23</ref> Shops and homes were ransacked and burned. The Chinese government heavily berated the Burmese government and started a [[war of words]], but no other actions were taken. The anti-Chinese riots continued till the early 1970s.  . 

However, after 1986, China withdrew support for the CPB<ref>Pillali, Sushil K. [http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/publication/faultlines/volume7/Fault7-GenPillaiF.htm The Invisible Country Ethnicity & Conflict Management in Myanmar]. South Asia Terroism Portal. Institute for Conflict Management</ref> and began supplying the military junta with the majority of its arms in exchange for increased access to Burmese markets and a rumoured naval base on [[Coco Islands]] in the [[Andaman Sea]]. China is supposed to have an intelligence gathering station on the [[Great Coco Island]] to monitor Indian naval activity as well as [[ISRO]] & [[DRDO]] missile and space launch activities. The influx of Chinese arms turned the tide in Burma against the ethnic insurgencies, many of which had relied indirectly on Chinese complicity. As a result the military junta of Burma is highly reliant on the Chinese for their currently high level of power.  .

In 1961, [[U Thant]], then Burma's Permanent Representative to the United Nations and former Secretary to the Prime Minister, was elected [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]]; he was the first non-Westerner to head any international organization and would serve as UN Secretary-General for ten years. <ref name="az">{{cite web|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=7610|author=Aung Zaw|title=Can Another Asian Fill U Thant's Shoes?|publisher=''[[The Irrawaddy]]'' September 2006|accessdate=2006-09-12}}</ref> Among the Burmese to work at the UN when he was Secretary-General was the young [[Aung San Suu Kyi]].  . 

Until 2005, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] annually adopted a detailed resolution about the situation in Burma by consensus. <ref name = "UN-5483030">

South Africa also voted against the resolution, arguing that since there were no peace and security concerns raised by its neighbours, the question did not belong in the Security Council when there were other more appropriate bodies to represent it, adding, "Ironically, should the Security Council adopt [this resolution] ... the [[Human Rights Council]] would not be able to address the situation in Myanmar while the Council remains seized with the matter."<ref>{{UN document |docid=S-PV-5619 |body=Security Council |type=Verbotim Report |meeting=5619 |page=3 |anchor=pg003-bk01 |date=12 January 2007 |meetingtime=16:00 |speakername=Mr. Kumalo | speakernation=South Africa |accessdate=2007-09-25 }}</ref> The issue had been forced onto the agenda against the votes of Russia and the China<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/burmese/highlights/story/2006/09/060918_unsc_agenda_burma.shtml |title=UN Security Council to include Burma in its agenda |publisher=BBC News|date=18 September 2006 |accessdate=2006-11-17 }}</ref> by the United States ([[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto power]] applies only to resolutions) claiming that the outflow from Burma of refugees, drugs, HIV-AIDS, and other diseases threatened international peace and security. <ref>{{UN document |docid=S-PV-5526 |body=Security Council |type=Verbotim Report |meeting=5526 |page=3 |anchor=pg003-bk02 |date=15 September 2006 |meetingtime=13:35 |speakername=Mr. Bolton | speakernation=United States |accessdate=2007-09-25 }}</ref> . 

The following September after the uprisings began and the human rights situation deteriorated, the Secretary-General dispatched his special envoy for the region, [[Ibrahim Gambari]], to meet with the government. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=23992|title=Ban Ki-moon dispatches Myanmar envoy to region as situation worsens|date=26 September 2007|publisher=United Nations}}</ref> After seeing most parties involved, he returned to New York and briefed the [[Security Council]] about his visit. <ref>{{UN document |docid=S-PV-5753 |body=Security Council |type=Verbotim Report |meeting=5753 |page=3 |anchor=pg003-bk02 |date=5 October 2007 |meetingtime=10:00 |speakername=Mr. Gambari | speakernation=Special Envoy of the Secretary-General |accessdate=2007-10-09 }}</ref> During this meeting, the ambassador said that the country "indeed [has experienced] a daunting challenge. However, we have been able to restore stability. The situation has now returned to normalcy. Currently, people all over the country are holding peaceful rallies within the bounds of the law to welcome the successful conclusion of the national convention, which has laid down the fundamental principles for a [[New Burmese Constitution|new constitution]], and to demonstrate their aversion to recent provocative demonstrations. <ref>{{UN document |docid=S-PV-5753 |body=Security Council |type=Verbotim Report |meeting=5753 |page=17 |anchor=pg017-bk02-pa04 |date=5 October 2007 |meetingtime=10:00 |speakername=Mr. Swe | speakernation=Myanmar |accessdate=2007-10-09 }}</ref> . 

On 11 October the Security Council met and issued a statement and reaffirmed its "strong and unwavering support for the Secretary-General's good offices mission", especially the work by [[Ibrahim Gambari]]<ref name="UN_SPV5757">{{UN document |docid=S-PV-5757 |type=Verbatim Report |body=Security Council |meeting=5757 |accessdate=2007-10-15|date=11 October 2007}}</ref> (During a briefing to the Security Council in November, Gambari admitted that no timeframe had been set by the Government for any of the moves that he had been negotiating for.)<ref>{{UN document |docid=S-PV-5777 |body=Security Council |type=Verbotim Report |meeting=5777 |page=2 |anchor=pg002-bk08-pa10 |date=13 November 2007 |speakername=Mr. Gambari |accessdate=2007-11-15 }}</ref> .
