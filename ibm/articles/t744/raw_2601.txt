A '''general election''' was held in [[Burma]] (officially '''Myanmar''') on {{Nowrap|7 November}} 2010, in accordance with the new [[Constitution of Burma|constitution]] which was approved in a [[Burmese constitutional referendum, 2008|referendum]] held in {{Nowrap|May 2008}}. The date of the election, 7 November, was announced by the SPDC on {{Nowrap|13 August}}. <ref>{{cite news | title = Myanmar's Government Schedules Elections | url = http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/08/13/world/asia/AP-AS-Myanmar-Election.html | work = [[The New York Times]] | agency = [[Associated Press]] | date = 13 August 2010 | accessdate = 13 August 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> . 

The general election forms the fifth step of the seven-step "[[roadmap to democracy]]" proposed by the [[State Peace and Development Council]] (SPDC) in 2003,<ref>[http://www.kuwaittimes.net/read_news.php?newsid=MjM3NTc0NzU0 Myanmar leader says 2010 election plans on course].

The [[Union Solidarity and Development Party]] declared victory, after at least two opposition parties conceded. The United Nations and Western countries have condemned the elections as fraudulent.  . 

==Background==. 
Article 59F of the new constitution bars from the Presidency (not public office in general) people who are married to citizens of states other than Myanmar. Some commentators claim that this means [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] will be unable to contest the election,<ref>[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hdzlET4wtgI_H2_23kAR75kNhr8A Ban on Suu Kyi shatters hopes for Myanmar polls: analysts].

The [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD) had set a number of conditions for participating in the poll, including changes to the constitution to reduce the army's influence, international supervision for free and fair polls, and freeing all [[political prisoner]]s including Suu Kyi. <ref>[http://www.voanews.com/english/2009-04-29-voa41.cfm Burmese Opposition Party Sets Conditions for Elections].

===New election laws===. 
The first of five election laws was announced in March 2010, concerning the creation of an election commission. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article7054903.ece|title=Burma publishes new election laws|last=Parry|first=Richard Lloyd|date=March 9, 2010|publisher=The Times | location=London}}</ref> The [[Union Election Commission]] Law states that the military government will appoint all members of the commission and have the final say over the election results. Members of the commission must be "an eminent person, to have integrity and experience, to be loyal to the state and its citizens". <ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2010/03/2010394417778884.html|title=Myanmar unveils election law  |last=Agencies|date=March 9, 2010|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]}}</ref> A 17-member [[Union Election Commission|election commission]] was later named, headed by a former military officer. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.portalangop.co.ao/motix/en_us/noticias/internacional/2010/2/10/Burma-laws-condemned-mockery-democracy,31d358ca-c3d9-4358-be56-66562c5adb05.html|title=Burma laws condemned as a 'mockery' of democracy|date=March 11, 2010|publisher=Angola Press}}</ref> . 

The second law bans anyone currently serving a prison term from belonging to a political party, and therefore over 2,000 [[political prisoner]]s will not be able to participate, possibly including Aung San Suu Kyi (depending on whether her house arrest is deemed to fall under the definition of "serving a prison term"). <ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8559048.stm|title= Burma law formally bars Aung San Suu Kyi from election|date=March 10, 2010|publisher=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/Myanmars-Aung-San-Suu-Kyi-to-be-barred-from-party-and-polls-/articleshow/5666682.cms|title=Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi to be barred from party and polls |last=AFP|date=March 11, 2010|publisher=[[The Times of India]]}}</ref> The Political Parties Registration Law also bars members of religious orders, members of insurgent groups 'as defined by the state' and foreigners from joining political parties. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://sify.com/news/myanmar-election-law-bars-aung-san-suu-kyi-from-polls-news-international-kdkladbjiba.html|title=Myanmar election law bars Aung San Suu Kyi from polls |date=March 10, 2010|publisher=[[Sify]]}}</ref> This separation of Buddhism and politics is a long-standing feature of Burmese politics, dating back to before independence, and was incorporated in the 1947 independence Constitution at the request of the monkhood. <ref>[http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=6280 International Crisis Group: Myanmar - Towards the Elections, p.8.]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref> . 

The other laws stipulate that anyone currently serving a prison term is barred from running or voting in the elections for the upper and lower houses. <ref name=ap2>{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gR7Ynyd2tM3aj2CQ75jX3joFYjXQD9ECARQO0|title=Law bars Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi from voting|last=[[Associated Press]]|date=March 11, 2010}}</ref> A 224-member House of Nationalities will have 168 elected candidates and 56 nominated by the military chief, while the 440-member House of Representatives will have 330 elected civilians and 110 military representatives. <ref name=ap2/> At the same time, the results of the [[Burmese general election, 1990|1990 elections]] were annulled as they did not comply with the new election laws. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/11/AR2010031100582.html|title=Myanmar junta annuls election held 20 years ago|last=Reuters|date=March 11, 2010|publisher=The Washington Post}}</ref> . 

The new laws have been described as a "farce" by the [[Philippines]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.ph.msn.com/regional/article.aspx?cp-documentid=3940490|title=Philippines hits out at Myanmar junta over Suu Kyi|last=AFP|date=March 11, 2010|publisher=MSN Philippines News}}</ref> and a "mockery" by the United States. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2010/03/201031133928575295.html|title=US condemns Myanmar poll 'mockery'  |last=Agencies|date=March 11, 2010|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]}}</ref> .

168 of the 224 seats in the [[Amyotha Hluttaw]] (House of Nationalities) were up for election. The remaining 56 seats (25%) were not elected, and instead reserved for military appointees (taken from Defense Services personnel), technically called Army Representatives (AR).  .

Parties are required to have at least 1,000 members to participate in the election and had to register by {{Nowrap|6 June}}. 40 parties have been approved by the Electoral Commission to contest the elections,<ref>{{cite news|last=Buncombe|first=Andrew|title=Burma bans marching and chanting during rallies |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/burma-bans-marching-and-chanting-during--rallies-2008359.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=23 June 2010|location=London}}</ref> some of which are linked to [[List of ethnic groups in Burma|ethnic minorities]]. <ref name=ReuNDF>[http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6455UR20100506 Suu Kyi party splits, faction to run in Myanmar poll].

The [[National League for Democracy]], which overwhelmingly won the previous [[Burmese general election, 1990|1990 elections]] but were never allowed to take power, decided not to participate.

===International response===. 
The [[United Nations]] has expressed concern about the fairness of the election<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/22/world/asia/22nations.html|date=22 October 2010|publisher=The New York Times | first=Neil|last=MacFarquhar|title=U.N. Doubts Fairness of Election in Myanmar}}</ref> and [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] expressed "grave concern" that Aung San Suu Kyi would not be released before the election and thus it would "lack credibility." He accused the government of being "slow and incomplete" to meet political commitments, and said it was "deeply frustrating" that the government would not hold talks with the "international community."<ref>[http://burmaelection2010.com/international/521.html ]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref> . 

The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Jiang Yu, commented on the election during Than Shwe's visit to China. "The international community can provide constructive help [for the elections] and refrain from any negative impact on the domestic political process of Myanmar and on regional peace and stability."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2010/09/2010971090798336.html |title=China hosts Myanmar military leader |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=2010-09-07 |accessdate=2010-11-11}}</ref> . 

The following day, US Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] spoke to the US Senate Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on State and Foreign Affairs where she mentioned that the trial against Aung San Suu Kyi was allegedly "baseless charges." She also added that the government was "continuing resistance to a free and open electoral process. If they stay on the track they're on, their elections in 2010 will be totally illegitimate and without any meaning in the international community." She admitted that "We are absolutely committed to trying to come up with an approach that might influence the regime. We are going to try to do our best to influence them to see that this repressive regime is not one that we should continue to support, and hopefully get a greater international base to take action against them." She claimed to have support from other countries, "I have been heartened by the response that we have received. I have spoken to a number of the foreign secretaries of [[ASEAN]] countries, who've issued strong statements." She added that she was working to get more support in the United Nations. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=15692 |title=2010 Burmese Election may be Illegitimate: Clinton |publisher=Irrawaddy.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-11}}</ref> .

==Monitors==. 
Burma barred foreign observers and the international media from the election. The election commission chief, Thein Soe, did add, however, that diplomats and representatives from UN organisations in the country would be allowed to observe the election. He justified the decision saying "We are holding the election for this country. It's not for other countries&nbsp;...

The Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) took 80% of the seats that were up for election. The two largest opposition parties, the National Democratic Front and the Democratic Party (Burma) conceded defeat, however, along with four other opposition parties, filed formal complaints about fraud with the election commission. <ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite news|author=Reuters in Rangoon |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/nov/09/burma-usdp-wins-election |title=Burmese election won by military-backed party |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date= 9 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-11 |location=London}}</ref> .

The new and previously announced results show the USDP gained majorities in both houses of parliament: 190 out of the 219 (86%) seats announced for the 330-seat lower house, and 95 out of 107 (88%) seats announced for the 168-seat upper house. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=20051 |title=Burma's Pro-junta Party Wins Parliament Majority |publisher=Irrawaddy.org |date=2010-11-12 |accessdate=2011-02-04}}</ref> . 

===Reactions===. 
Than Nyein, the chairman of the National Democratic Force, claimed the election was marred by irregularities. "We have our evidence. Some candidates complained&nbsp;... because there was vote cheating." Khin Maung Swe, the leader of the opposition National Democratic Force alleged: "We took the lead at the beginning but the USDP later came up with so-called advance votes and that changed the results completely, so we lost." . 

UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] claimed voting conditions had been "insufficiently inclusive, participatory and transparent."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2010/11/201011953329831880.html |title=Myanmar parties concede poll defeat |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2010-11-11}}</ref> .

Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergey Lavrov]] welcomed the vote and characterized it as a "step forward in the democratisation of Burmese society."<ref name=autogenerated2 /> . 

During a speech to the Indian parliament, US President [[Barack Obama]] said of the election that "When peaceful democratic movements are suppressed – as in Burma – then the democracies of the world cannot remain silent&nbsp;... It is unacceptable to steal an election as the regime in Burma has done again for the world to see."<ref>{{cite web|author=ITGD Bureau |url=http://www.indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/119262/Top%20Stories/obama-supports-india-on-un-security-council-bid.html |title=Obama supports India on UN Security Council bid: Obama Visit : India Today |publisher=Indiatoday.intoday.in |date= |accessdate=2010-11-11}}</ref> . 

[[Edwin Lacierda]], the spokesperson of [[Philippines|Philippine]] [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Benigno Aquino III]], said in a press conference at [[Malacañang Palace]] that " [We] express our disappointment towards the actions done by the Burmese government towards the NLD, and also with regards to such a farce-like elections which just appeared to be a display." . 

==Analysis==. 
The relevance of [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] was questioned in light of the election. Prior to the election, she was regarded to be "the icon of the country's struggling democracy movement" outside the country. It was asked that following the election: "How much power and reach would she still have to rally her followers barely a week after the south-east Asian nation's first general election in two decades?" One such reason was because the NLD's boycott may have failed if it does not play the right cards in dealing with at least a semblance of an elected opposition in a "semi-legitimate" parliament. Pending her release from jail, the political atmosphere would have changed because of a new military leadership that may not be as "cosmopolitan" and "practical" in dealing both with her and external players. The British ambassador to Myanmar, Andrew Heyn, also said: "What they [[Military junta|the junta]] do when Suu Kyi is released will send a message. She is well informed and committed and wants to stay involved."<ref>{{cite web|author=Marwaan Macan-Markar |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/2010/11/201011813425351859.html |title=How relevant is Aung San Suu Kyi? - In Depth |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2010-11-11}}</ref> . 

==Aftermath==. 
{{Main|2010 Burma border clashes}}
The following day clashes erupted between the [[Democratic Karen Buddhist Army]] (DKBA) and government forces in [[Myawaddy]] by the Thai border. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2010/11/2010118479326824.html |title=Thousands flee Myanmar clashes |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2010-11-11}}</ref> The fighting spilled over to the town of [[Three Pagodas Pass]] with reports that the DKBA had seized the town from the military. According to some reports, the DKBA planned the action in the towns of Myawaddy and Three Pagodas Pass to take advantage of the deployment of the military for election monitoring. Many voters in the area, fearing an attack, stayed away from the polls. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=20004 |title=DKBA Troops Seize Three Pagodas Pass |publisher=Irrawaddy.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-11}}</ref> .
