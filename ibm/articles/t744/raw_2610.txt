It is bordered by [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[China]], [[Laos]] and [[Thailand]]. One-third of Burma's total perimeter of {{convert|1930|km}} forms an uninterrupted coastline along the [[Bay of Bengal]] and the [[Andaman Sea]]. At 676,578&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (261,227 sq mi), it is the 40th largest country in the world and the second largest country in Southeast Asia. Burma is also the 24th most populous country in the world with over 58.8&nbsp;million people. <ref>Asian Development Bank – Myanmar Fact Sheet, <http://www.adb.org/Documents/Fact_Sheets/MYA.pdf>.

Burma is home to some of the early civilizations of Southeast Asia including the [[Pyu city states|Pyu]] and the [[Mon kingdoms|Mon]]. <ref>{{cite book | title=Early civilizations of Southeast Asia | publisher=Altamira Press | author=Dougald JW O'Reilly | year=2007 | location=United Kingdom | isbn=10: 0-7591-0279-1}}</ref> In the 9th century, the [[Bamar|Burmans]] of the [[Kingdom of Nanzhao]], entered the upper Irrawaddy valley and, following the establishment of the [[Pagan Empire]] in the 1050s, the [[Burmese language|language]] and [[Culture of Burma|culture]] slowly became dominant in the country. During this period, [[Theravada Buddhism]] gradually became the predominant religion of the country. The Pagan Empire fell due to the [[Mongol invasion of Burma|Mongol invasions]] (1277–1301), and several warring states emerged. In the second half of the 16th century, the country was reunified by the  [[Taungoo Dynasty]] which for a brief period was the largest empire in the [[history of Southeast Asia]]. <ref name=vbl-152>Lieberman 2003: 152</ref> The early 19th century [[Konbaung Dynasty]] ruled over an area that included modern Burma as well as [[Manipur]] and [[Assam]]. The country was colonized by Britain following three [[Anglo-Burmese Wars]] (1824–1885).  . 

British rule brought social, economic, cultural and administrative changes to the once-feudal society. Since independence in 1948, the country has been in one of the [[List of ongoing military conflicts#Other conflicts|longest running]]  [[Internal conflict in Burma|civil wars]] among the country's [[List of ethnic groups in Burma|myriad ethnic groups]] that remains unresolved. From 1962 to 2011, the country was under [[Military dictatorship|military rule]]. The [[State Peace and Development Council|military junta]] was dissolved in 2011 following a [[Burmese general election, 2010|general election in 2010]] and a civilian government installed.  . 

Burma is a resource rich country. However, since the [[Burmese way to socialism|reformations of 1962]], the [[Economy of Burma|Burmese economy]] has become one of the least developed in the world. Burma’s GDP stands at $42.953&nbsp;billion and grows at an average rate of 2.9% annually – the lowest rate of economic growth in the Greater [[Mekong]] Subregion. <ref name="CIA">{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bm.html |title=Burma |accessdate =13 January 2007 |work=The World Factbook | publisher=Central Intelligence Agency}}</ref> Among others, the EU, United States and Canada have imposed economic sanctions on Burma. <ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8195956.stm | title=Overview of Burma sanctions |publisher=BBC  | date=18 December 2009 | accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref> Burma's health care system is one of the worst in the world: The [[World Health Organization]] ranked Burma at [[World Health Organization's ranking of health care systems|190th]], the worst performing of all countries.  .

==Name==. 
{{Main|Names of Burma}} . 

Both "Burma" and "Myanmar" are derived from the name of the majority Burmese [[Bamar]] ethnic group. "Myanmar" is considered to be the literary form of the name of the ethnic group, while "Burma" is derived from Bamar, the colloquial form of the name of the group. Depending on the [[register (linguistics)|register]] used the pronunciation would be "Bama" ({{IPA-my|bəmà|pron}}), or "Myamah" ({{IPA-my|mjəmà|pron}}). The name "Burma" has been in use in English since the time of [[British Burma|British colonial rule]].  . 

In 1989, the military government [[Geographical renaming|officially changed]] the English translations of many colonial-era names; among these changes was the alteration of the name of the country to "Myanmar". The renaming remains a contested issue. <ref name="Houtman">{{cite book |url=http://homepages.tesco.net/~ghoutman |title=Mental culture in Burmese crisis politics |last=Houtman |first=Gustaaf |year=1999 |series=ILCAA Study of Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa Monograph Series No. 33|publisher=Institute for the Study of Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa |pages=43–47 |isbn=978-4872977486}}</ref> Many opposition groups and countries continue to use "Burma" because they do not recognise the legitimacy of the ruling military government or its authority to rename the country. <ref name="steinberg">{{cite book |last=Steinberg |first=David L. |year=2002 |month=February |title=Burma: The State of Myanmar |publisher=[[Georgetown University|Georgetown University Press]] |id=ISBN}}</ref> Various non-Burman ethnic groups choose not to recognise the name because of the association of the term "Myanmar" with the majority ethnic group, the [[Bamar]], rather than with the country. <ref name="thantmyintu2001">{{cite book | first=Thant | last=Myint-U | year=2001 | title=The Making of Modern Burma | isbn=0-521-79914-7 | publisher=Cambridge Univ.

===Early history===. 
{{Main|Prehistory of Burma|Pyu city-states|Mon city-states}}
[[File:The neolithic culture of Padah Lin cave.png|thumb|Neolithic paintings found inside [[Padah-Lin Caves]], [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon]] dated up to 13,000 years ago]] . 

Archaeological evidence shows that the ''[[homo erectus]]'' had lived in the region now known as [[Burma]] as early as 750,000 years ago, and the ''[[homo sapiens]]'' about 11,000 BCE, in a [[Stone Age]] culture called the ''Anyathian'', when plants and animals were first domesticated and polished stone tools appeared in Burma. <ref name=rmc-1>Cooler 2002: Chapter 1</ref> The [[Bronze Age]] arrived circa 1500 BCE when people in the region were turning copper into bronze, growing rice, and domesticating chickens and pigs; they were among the first people in the world to do so. The [[Iron Age]] arrived around 500 BCE when iron-working settlements had emerged in an area south of present-day [[Mandalay]]. <ref name=tmu-2006-45>Myint-U 2006: 45</ref> Evidence also shows rice growing settlements of large villages and small cities that traded with their surroundings as far as China between 500 BCE and 200 CE. <ref name=bh-1>Hudson 2005: 1</ref> . 

Around the 2nd century BCE, the first known [[city-states]] emerged in central Burma. The city-states were founded as part of the southward migration by the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]]-speaking [[Pyu people|Pyu]], the earliest inhabitants of Burma of whom records are extant, from present-day [[Yunnan]]. <ref name=dgeh-8-10>Hall 1960: 8-10</ref><ref name=ehm-236>Moore 2007: 236</ref> The Pyu culture was heavily influenced by trade with [[India]], importing [[Buddhism]] as well as other cultural, architectural and political concepts, which would have an enduring influence on later Burmese culture and political organization. <ref name=tmu-2006-51-52>Myint-U 2006: 51–52</ref> By the 9th century CE, several city-states had sprouted across the land: the Pyu states in the central dry zone, Mon states along the southern coastline and Arakanese states along the western littoral. The balance was upset when the Pyu states came under repeated attacks from the [[Kingdom of Nanzhao]] between the 750s and the 830s. In the mid-to-late 9th century, the [[Bamar|Mranma]] (Burmans/Bamar) of Nanzhao founded a small settlement at [[Bagan|Pagan]] (Bagan). It was was one of several competing city-states until the late 10th century when it grew in authority and grandeur. <ref name=vbl-90-91>Lieberman 2003: 90–91</ref> . 

===Imperial era (849–1885)===.

[[File:Bagan, Burma.jpg|thumb|Pagodas and temples in present-day [[Bagan|Pagan]] (Bagan), the capital of the [[Pagan Kingdom]]]] . 

Pagan gradually grew to absorb its surrounding states until the 1050s–1060s when [[Anawrahta]] founded the [[Pagan Empire]], the first ever unification of the Irrawaddy valley and its periphery. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Pagan Empire and the [[Khmer Empire]] were two main powers in [[mainland Southeast Asia]]. <ref name=vbl-24>Lieberman 2003: 24</ref> The [[Burmese language]] and [[Burmese culture|culture]] gradually became dominant in the upper Irrawaddy valley, eclipsing the [[Pyu language|Pyu]], [[Mon language|Mon]] and [[Pali]] norms by the late 12th century. [[Theravada Buddhism]] slowly began to spread to the village level although [[Vajrayana|Tantric]], [[Mahayana]], [[Brahmanic]], and [[animist]] practices remained heavily entrenched. Pagan's rulers and wealthy built over 10,000 Buddhist temples in the Pagan capital zone alone. Repeated [[Mongol invasion of Burma|Mongol invasions]] (1277–1301) toppled the four-century-old kingdom in 1287. <ref name=mha-63-65>Htin Aung 1967: 63–65</ref> . 

[[File:MysticalMraukU.jpg|thumb|Temples at Mrauk U]] . 

Pagan's collapse was followed by 250 years of political fragmentation that lasted well into the 16th century. Like the Burmans four centuries earlier, [[Shan people|Shan]] migrants who arrived with the Mongol invasions stayed behind. Several competing [[Shan states]] came to dominate the entire northwestern to eastern arc surrounding the Irrawaddy valley. The valley too was beset with petty states until the late 14th century when two sizable powers, [[Ava Kingdom]] and [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom]], emerged. In the west, a politically fragmented Arakan was under competing influences of its stronger neighbors until the [[Kingdom of Mrauk U]] unified the Arakan coastline for the first time in 1437.  . 

Early on, Ava fought [[Forty Years' War|wars of unification]] (1385–1424) but could never quite reassemble the lost empire. Having held off Ava, Hanthawaddy entered its golden age, and Arakan went on to become a power in its own right for the next 350 years. In contrast, constant warfare left Ava greatly weakened, and it slowly disintegrated from 1481 onward. In 1527, the [[Confederation of Shan States]] conquered Ava itself, and ruled Upper Burma until 1555.  . 

Like the Pagan Empire, Ava, Hanthawaddy and the Shan states were all multi-ethnic polities. Despite the wars, cultural synchronization continued. This period is considered a golden age for Burmese culture. [[Burmese literature]] "grew more confident, popular, and stylistically diverse", and the second generation of Burmese law codes as well as the earliest pan-Burma chronicles emerged. <ref name=vbl-134>Lieberman 2003: 134</ref> Hanthawaddy monarchs introduced religious reforms that later spread to the rest of the country. <ref name=tmu-2006-64-65>Myint-U 2006: 64–65</ref> Many splendid temples of Mrauk U were built during this period.  . 

[[File:Map of Taungoo Empire (1580).png|thumb|left|Bayinnaung's Empire in 1580]]
Political unification returned in the mid-16th century, due to the efforts of one tiny [[Toungoo Dynasty|Toungoo]] (Taungoo), a former vassal state of Ava. Toungoo's young, ambitious king [[Tabinshwehti]] [[Toungoo–Hanthawaddy War (1535–1541)|defeated]] the more powerful Hanthawaddy in 1541. His successor [[Bayinnaung]] went on to conquer a vast swath of [[mainland Southeast Asia]] including the [[Shan states]], [[Lan Na]], [[Manipur]], the [[Mong Mao|Chinese Shan states]], [[Ayutthaya kingdom|Siam]], [[Lan Xang]] and southern Arakan. However, the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia unravelled soon after Bayinnaung's death in 1581, completely collapsing by 1599. Siam seized Tenasserim and Lan Na, and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] mercenaries established [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese rule]] at [[Thanlyin|Syriam]] (Thanlyin).  . 

The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Burma, Upper Burma, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated [[Manipuri]] raids into Upper Burma, and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Burma founded the [[Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom]]. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty.  . 

[[File:Shwedagon pagoda.jpg|thumb|A British 1825 lithograph of [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] shows British occupation during the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]].]] . 

After the fall of Ava, one resistance group, [[Alaungpaya]]'s [[Konbaung Dynasty]] [[Konbaung-Hanthawaddy War|defeated]] Restored Hanthawaddy, and by 1759, had reunited all of Burma (and Manipur), and driven out the French and the British who had provided arms to Hanthawaddy. By 1770, Alaungpaya's heirs had subdued much of [[Laos]] (1765), [[Burmese–Siamese War (1765–1767)|defeated Siam]] (1767), and [[Sino–Burmese War (1765–1769)|defeated four invasions]] by [[Qing Dynasty|China]] (1765–1769). <ref name=vbl-184-187>Lieberman 2003: 184–187</ref> With Burma preoccupied by the Chinese threat, Siam recovered its territories by 1770, and went on to capture Lan Na by 1776. Burma and Siam went to war until 1855, but all resulted in a stalemate, exchanging Tenasserim (to Burma) and Lan Na (to Siam). Faced with a powerful China and a resurgent Siam in the east, King [[Bodawpaya]] turned west, acquiring Arakan (1785), Manipur (1814) and Assam (1817). It was second largest empire in Burmese history but also one with a long ill-defined border with [[British India]]. <ref name=tmu-109>Myint-U 2006: 109</ref> . 

The breadth of this empire was short lived. Burma lost Arakan, Manipur, Assam and Tenasserim to the British in the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] (1824–1826). In 1852, the British easily seized [[Lower Burma]] in the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]]. King [[Mindon]] tried to modernize the kingdom, and in 1875 narrowly avoided annexation by ceding the [[Karenni States]]. The British, alarmed by the consolidation of [[French Indo-China]], annexed the remainder of the country in the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War]] in 1885.  . 

Konbaung kings extended Restored Toungoo's administrative reforms, and achieved unprecedented levels of internal control and external expansion. For the first time in history, the Burmese language and culture came to predominate the entire Irrawaddy valley. The evolution and growth of Burmese literature and theater continued, aided by an extremely high adult male literacy rate for the era (half of all males and 5% of females). <ref name=vbl-202-206>Lieberman 2003: 202–206</ref> Nonetheless, the extent and pace of reforms were uneven and ultimately proved insufficient to stem the advance of British colonialism.  . 

===Colonial era (1886–1948)===. 
{{main|British rule in Burma}}
[[File:British forces arrival mandalay1885.jpg|thumb|The landing of British forces in Mandalay after the last of the [[Anglo-Burmese War]]s, which resulted in the abdication of the last Burmese monarch, King [[Thibaw Min]].]]
[[File:IND 004723.jpg|thumb|right|British troops firing a [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] on the [[Mawchi]] road, July 1944.]] . 

With the fall of Mandalay, all of Burma came under British rule. Throughout the colonial era, many Indians arrived as soldiers, civil servants, construction workers and traders and, along with the Anglo-Burmese community, dominated commercial and civil life in Burma. Rangoon became the capital of British Burma and an important port between Calcutta and Singapore.  . 

Burmese resentment was strong and was vented in violent riots that paralysed Yangon on occasion all the way until the 1930s. <ref>{{cite book | first=Maurice | last=Collis | year=1945 | title=Trials in Burma}}</ref> Some of the discontent was caused by a disrespect for [[Burmese culture]] and traditions such as the British refusal to remove shoes when they entered pagodas. Buddhist monks became the vanguards of the independence movement. [[U Wisara]], an activist monk, died in prison after a 166-day hunger strike to protest a rule that forbade him from wearing his Buddhist robes while imprisoned. <ref>{{cite book | first=Heinz | last=Bechert | year=1984 | title=The World of Buddhism-Buddhist Monks and Nuns in Society and Culture | isbn=978-0871969828 | publisher=Facts on File | location=New York, N.Y.}}</ref> . 

On 1 April 1937, Burma became a separately administered colony of Great Britain and [[Ba Maw]] the first Prime Minister and Premier of Burma. Ba Maw was an outspoken advocate for Burmese self-rule and he opposed the participation of Great Britain, and by extension Burma, in World War II. He resigned from the Legislative Assembly and was arrested for sedition. In 1940, before Japan formally entered the Second World War, [[Aung San]] formed the [[Burma Independence Army]] in Japan.  . 

A major battleground, Burma was devastated during the Second World War. By March 1942, within months after they entered the war, Japanese troops had advanced on Rangoon and  the British administration had collapsed. A Burmese Executive Administration headed by Ba Maw was established by the Japanese in August 1942. Beginning in late 1944, allied troops launched a series of offensives that led to the end of Japanese rule in July 1945. However, the battles were intense with much of Burma laid waste by the fighting.  . 

Although many Burmese fought initially for the Japanese, some Burmese, mostly from the ethnic minorities, also served in the British Burma Army. <ref>{{cite book |first=Ian |last=Fellowes-Gordon |year=1971 |title=The Battle For Naw Seng's Kingdom: General Stilwel}}</ref> The [[Burma Independence Army]] and the Arakan National Army fought with the Japanese from 1942 to 1944, but switched allegiance to the Allied side in 1945.  . 

Following the World War II, Aung San negotiated the [[Panglong Agreement]] with ethnic leaders that guaranteed the independence of Burma as a unified state. In 1947, Aung San became Deputy Chairman of the Executive Council of Burma, a transitional government. But in July 1947, political rivals backed by the British<ref>{{cite news

{{Main|Post-independence Burma, 1948–1962}}
On 4 January 1948, the nation became an independent republic, named the ''Union of Burma'', with [[Sao Shwe Thaik]] as its first President and [[U Nu]] as its first Prime Minister. Unlike most other former British colonies and overseas territories, it did not become a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. A [[bicameral]] parliament was formed, consisting of a [[Chamber of Deputies]] and a [[Chamber of Nationalities]],<ref name="1947con">{{cite web |url=http://english.dvb.no/e_docs/511947_con.htm |title=The Constitution of the Union of Burma |accessdate=7 July 2006 |year=1947 |publisher=DVB| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060615072018/http://english.dvb.no/e_docs/511947_con.htm| archivedate = 15 June 2006}}</ref> and [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] elections were held in [[Burmese general election, 1951–1952|1951–1952]], [[Burmese general election, 1956|1956]] and [[Burmese general election, 1960|1960]].  . 

The geographical area Burma encompasses today can be traced to the [[Panglong Agreement]], which combined Burma Proper, which consisted of [[Lower Burma]] and [[Upper Burma]], and the [[Frontier Areas]], which had been administered separately by the British. <ref name="msmith">{{cite book |first=Martin |last=Smith |year=1991 |title=Burma -Insurgency and the Politics of Ethnicity |publisher=Zed Books |location=London and New Jersey |pages=42–43}}</ref> .

====The Ne Win years====. 
{{Main|1962 Burmese coup d'état}} . 

On 2 March 1962, the military led by General [[Ne Win]] took control of Burma through a coup d'état and the government has been under direct or indirect control by the military since then. Between 1962 and 1974, Burma was ruled by a revolutionary council headed by the general, and almost all aspects of society (business, media, production) were [[nationalized]] or brought under government control under the [[Burmese Way to Socialism]]<ref name="thantmyintu">{{cite book |first=Thant |last=Myint-U |year=2006 |title=The River of Lost Footsteps |isbn=0-374-16342-1 |publisher=Farra, Strauss and Giroux |location=New York}}</ref> which combined [[Soviet]]-style nationalisation and [[central planning]] with the governmental implementation of [[superstition|superstitious]] beliefs.{{Citation needed |date=July 2010}} A new [[Constitution of Burma|constitution of the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma]] was adopted in 1974, until 1988, the country was ruled as a [[Single-party state|one-party system]], with the General and other military officers resigning and ruling through the [[Burma Socialist Programme Party]] (BSPP). <ref name="christinafink">{{cite book |first=Christina |last=Fink |year=2001 |title=Living Silence:Burma under Military Rule |isbn=1-8564-9926-X |publisher=White Lotus |location=Bangkok}}</ref> During this period, Burma became one of the world's most impoverished countries. <ref name="ruin">{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/sep/28/burma.uk |title=The Burma road to ruin |work=The Guardian |location=London  |first=Mark |last=Tallentire |date=28 September 2007 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> . 

There were sporadic protests against military rule during the Ne Win years and these were almost always violently suppressed. On 7 July 1962, the government broke up demonstrations at [[Yangon University|Rangoon University]], killing 15 students. <ref name="thantmyintu"/> In 1974, the military violently suppressed anti-government protests at the funeral of [[U Thant]].

====SPDC rule (1988–2011)====. 
[[Image:8888 Uprising.jpg|right|thumb|Protesters gathering in central Rangoon, 1988]] . 

In 1988, unrest over economic mismanagement and political oppression by the government led to widespread pro-democracy demonstrations throughout the country known as the [[8888 Uprising]]. Security forces killed thousands of demonstrators, and General [[Saw Maung]] staged a coup d'état and formed the [[State Law and Order Restoration Council]] (SLORC). In 1989, SLORC declared [[martial law]] after widespread protests. The military government finalised plans for People's Assembly elections on 31 May 1989. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs/pyithu_hluttaw_election_law.htm |title=PYITHU HLUTTAW ELECTION LAW |accessdate=11 July 2006 |date=31 May 1989 |work=State Law and Order Restoration Council |publisher=iBiblio.org}}</ref> SLORC changed the country's official English name from the "Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma" to the "Union of Myanmar" in 1989.  .

On 23 June 1997, Burma was admitted into the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN). On 27 March 2006, the military junta, which had moved the national capital from [[Yangon]] to a site near [[Pyinmana]] in November 2005, officially named the new capital [[Naypyidaw]], meaning "city of the kings". <ref name="newcapital">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4848408.stm |title=Burma's new capital stages parade |publisher=BBC News |date=27 March 2006 |accessdate=24 June 2006 }}</ref> .

{{main|2011–2012 Burmese political reforms}} . 

The [[Burmese constitutional referendum, 2008]], promised a "discipline-flourishing democracy", was held on 10 May 2008 and the name of the country was changed from the '''Union of Myanmar''' to the '''Republic of the Union of Myanmar'''. General elections were held under the new constitution in 2010.  Observers described the election day of 2010 as mostly peaceful, though there were alleged irregularities in polling stations and the United Nations and Western countries condemned the elections as fraudulent. <ref name="t">{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2064470,00.html | title=The Slow Thaw of Burma's Notorious Military Junta |work=The Times |location=UK | accessdate=1 September 2011 | author=Andrew Marshall | date=11 April 2011}}</ref> The official turnout was reported as 77%. <ref name="tni.org">[http://www.tni.org/briefing/changing-ethnic-landscape-analysis-burmas-2010-polls A Changing Ethnic Landscape: Analysis of Burma's 2010 Polls] Burma Policy Briefing 4. of the [[Transnational Institute]] and Burma Centrum Nederland</ref> The military-backed [[Union Solidarity and Development Party]] declared victory stating that it had won 80% of the votes. That claim was widely disputed by pro-democracy opposition groups, which asserted that the military regime engaged in rampant fraud to achieve its result. <ref name="tni.org"/>  . 

Since the elections, the government has embarked on a series of reforms toward [[liberal democracy]], [[mixed economy]], and reconciliation although the motives of such reforms are still debated.  These reforms include the release of pro-democracy leader [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] from house arrest, establishment of the National Human Rights Commission,  general amnesties of more than 200 political prisoners, institution of new labour laws that allow labour unions and strikes, relaxation of press censorship and regulations of currency practices. <ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-15303968 | title=Obstacles lie ahead in Burma's bid for reform |publisher=BBC | date=19 November 2011 | accessdate=20 November 2011 | author=David Loyn}}</ref> The reforms come as a surprise to many because [[Burmese general election, 2010|the election of 2010]] was considered fraudulent by the international community. <ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/22/world/asia/22nations.html | title=U.N.

The consequences of the reforms are far-reaching. The ASEAN members have approved Burma's bid for ASEAN chair in 2014. United States Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] visited Burma in December 2011 to encourage further progress, the first visit by a Secretary of State in more than fifty years.

The April 1 election was perhaps the most promising moment of reform. Led by Aung San Suu Kyi, the [[National League for Democracy]] won 44 of 45 seats up for grab. Although only a small fraction of the seats were up for a vote, the previously illegal NLD was allowed to campaign, run, and win for the first time.

==Government and politics==. 
{{Main|Politics of Burma}}
The constitution of Burma, its third since independence, was drafted by its military rulers and published in September 2008. The country is governed as a [[Presidential system|presidential republic]] with a bicameral legislature, with a portion of legislatures appointed by the military and others elected in general elections. The current head of state, inaugurated as [[President of Burma|President]] on 30 March 2011, is [[Thein Sein]].  . 

The legislature, called the [[Pyidaungsu Hluttaw]], is bicameral and made up of two houses: The 224-seat upper house [[Amyotha Hluttaw]] (House of Nationalities) and the 440-seat lower house [[Pyithu Hluttaw]] (House of Representatives). The upper house consists of 224 member of which 168 are directly elected and 56 are appointed by the Burmese Armed Forces while the lower house consists of 440 members of which 330 are directly elected and 110 are appointed by the armed forces. The major political parties are the [[National Democratic Force]] and the two backed by the military:  the [[National Unity Party (Burma)|National Unity Party]], and the [[Union Solidarity and Development Party]].  The [[National League for Democracy]], the party of [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], was declared illegal before the 2010 elections for failing to register for the elections.  . 

Burma's army-drafted constitution was approved in a [[Burmese constitutional referendum, 2008|referendum]] in May 2008.

A 2011 report by the [[Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations]] found that while constrained by donor restrictions on contact with the Myanmar government, international humanitarian Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) see opportunities for effective advocacy with government officials, especially at the local level. At the same time, International NGOs are mindful of the ethical quandary of how to work with the government without bolstering or appeasing it. <ref>[http://www.hks.harvard.edu/hauser/engage/humanitarianorganizations/research/assets/Myanmar%20Report%20Final%20Version%209-8-11.pdf Working Through Ambiguity: International NGOs in Myanmar].

The country is one of the poorest nations in Southeast Asia, suffering from decades of stagnation, mismanagement and isolation. The lack of an educated workforce skilled in modern technology contributes to the growing problems of the economy. <ref>{{cite book | first=Ian | last=Brown | year=2005 | title=A Colonial Economy In Crisis | publisher=Routledge | isbn=0-4153-0580-2}}</ref> The country lacks adequate infrastructure.

Under British administration, Burma was the second-wealthiest country in South-East Asia. It had been the world's largest exporter of rice. Burma also had a wealth of natural and labour resources. It produced 75% of the world's [[teak]] and had a highly literate population. <ref name="steinberg"/> The country was believed to be on the fast track to development. <ref name="steinberg"/>  . 

During World War II, the British destroyed the major oil wells and mines for tungsten, tin, lead and silver to keep them from the Japanese. Burma was bombed extensively by both sides. After a parliamentary government was formed in 1948, Prime Minister [[U Nu]] embarked upon a policy of nationalization and the state was declared the owner of all land. The government also tried to implement a poorly considered Eight-Year plan. By the 1950s, rice exports had fallen by two thirds and mineral exports by over 96% (as compared to the pre-World War II period). Plans were partly financed by printing money, which led to inflation. <ref name =watkins>{{cite web|url=http://www2.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/burma.htm |title=Political and Economic History of Myanmar (Burma) Economics |accessdate=8 July 2006|last=Watkins |first=Thayer |publisher=San José State University}}</ref> The 1962 coup d'état was followed by an economic scheme called the [[Burmese Way to Socialism]], a plan to nationalise all industries, with the exception of agriculture.

[[File:Rijstvelden Myanmar 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Rice cultivation accounts for much of the agriculture in Burma today.]] . 

===Agriculture===. 
The major agricultural product is rice which covers about 60% of the country's total cultivated land area. Rice accounts for 97% of total food grain production by weight. Through collaboration with the [[International Rice Research Institute]] 52 modern rice varieties were released in the country between 1966 and 1997, helping increase national rice production to 14 million tons in 1987 and to 19&nbsp;million tons in 1996. By 1988, modern varieties were planted on half of the country's ricelands, including 98 percent of the irrigated areas. <ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.irri.org/media/facts/pdfs/myanmar.pdf Myanmar and IRRI]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}|21.2&nbsp;KB}}, Facts About Cooperation, International Rice Research Institute. Retrieved on 25 September 2007. </ref> In 2008 rice production was estimated at 50 million tons. <ref>http://faostat.fao.org/site/339/default.aspx</ref>  . 

Burma is also the world's second largest producer of [[opium]], accounting for 8% of entire world production and is a major source of [[illegal drug]]s, including [[amphetamines]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/pdf/myanmar/myanmar_country_profile_2005.pdf |title=Myanmar Country Profile |accessdate=9 July 2006 |year=2005 |month=December |format=PDF |work=Office on Drugs and Crime | pages=5–6 | publisher=United Nations}}</ref>
Opium bans implemented since 2002 after international pressure have left ex-poppy farmers without sustainable sources of income in the Kokang and Wa regions. They depend on casual labour for income. <ref>[http://www.tni.org/briefing/golden-triangle-rubber-belt Drug Policy Briefing nr.29] of the [[Transnational Institute]]. </ref> . 

===Natural resources===. 
Burma produces precious stones such as [[sapphire]]s, [[pearls]] and [[jade]]. [[Rubies]] are the biggest earner; 90% of the world's [[rubies]] come from the country, whose red stones are prized for their purity and [[hue]]. Thailand buys the majority of the country's [[Gemstone|gems]]. Burma's "''Valley of Rubies''", the mountainous [[Mogok Township|Mogok]] area, {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Mandalay]], is noted for its rare pigeon's blood rubies and blue sapphires. <ref>[http://www.uvm.edu/envnr/gemecology/index.html Gems of Burma and their Environmental Impact]. </ref> Many U.S. and European jewellery companies, including Bulgari, Tiffany, and Cartier, refuse to import these stones based on reports of deplorable working conditions in the mines. Human Rights Watch has encouraged a complete ban on the purchase of Burmese gems based on these reports and because nearly all profits go to the ruling junta, as the majority of mining activity in the country is government-run. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2007/11/11/burma-gem-trade-bolsters-military-regime-fuels-atrocities |title=Burma: Gem Trade Bolsters Military Regime, Fuels Atrocities |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=11 November 2007}}</ref> The government of Burma controls the gem trade by direct ownership or by joint ventures with private owners of mines. <ref>[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/38144/burmese-gem-emporium-rakes-in-15-billion-despite-human-rights-abuse-concerns/ Burmese Gem Emporium Rakes in $1.5&nbsp;Billion Despite Human Rights Abuse Concerns] ARTINFO.com</ref>    .

Colonial architectural influences are most evident in major cities such as [[Yangon]]. <ref>{{cite news |first=Steven |last=Martin |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3578993.stm |title=Burma maintains bygone buildings |publisher=BBC News |date=March 2004 |accessdate=9 July 2006 }}</ref> Many ethnic minorities, particularly the [[Karen people|Karen]] in the southeast, and the Kachin and [[Chin (people)]] who populate the north and north-east, practice Christianity. <ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.archive.org/details/TheSilkenEast |title=The Silken East – A Record of Life and Travel in Burma |first=V.

However, the exiled leaders and organisations claims that Ethnic population is 40% which is implicitly contrasted with CIA report (official U.S report).  . 

===Language===. 
{{Main|Languages of Burma}}
[[Burmese language|Burmese]], the mother tongue of the Bamar and official language of Burma, is related to [[Tibetan language|Tibetan]] and to the Chinese languages. <ref name="ethno"/> It is written in a [[Burmese script|script]] consisting of circular and semi-circular letters, which were adapted from the [[Mon language|Mon script]], which in turn was developed from a southern Indian script in the 8th century. The earliest known inscriptions in the Burmese script date from the 11th century. It is also used to write [[Pāli|Pali]], the sacred language of [[Theravada Buddhism]], as well as several ethnic minority languages, including Shan, several Karen dialects, and Kayah (Karenni), with the addition of specialised characters and [[diacritic]]s for each language. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://lwinmoe.friendsofburma.org/doc/myanmar_extension.pdf |title=Proposal for encoding characters for Myanmar minority languages in the UCS |accessdate=9 July 2006 |date=2 April 2006 |format=PDF |publisher=International Organization for Standardization}}</ref> The Burmese language incorporates widespread usage of [[honorific]]s and is age-oriented. <ref name="Myam-ma" /> Burmese society has traditionally stressed the importance of education. In villages, secular schooling often takes place in [[monastery|monasteries]]. Secondary and tertiary education take place at government schools.  .

Many religions are practised in Burma. Religious edifices and orders have been in existence for many years. Festivals can be held on a grand scale. The Christian and Muslim populations do, however, face religious persecution and it is hard, if not impossible, for non-Buddhists to join the army or get government jobs, the main route to success in the country. <ref>"Ethnic and Religious Diversity: Myanmar's Unfolding Nemesis", Matthews, Bruce, Institute of South East Asian Studies, Visiting Researcher Series, Volume 2001, No. 3. 2001. </ref> Such persecution and targeting of civilians is particularly notable in Eastern Burma, where over 3000 villages have been destroyed in the past ten years. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://tbbc.org/resources.html#reports |title=Internal Displacement in Eastern Burma 2006 Survey |accessdate=4 February 2007 |author=Thailand Burma Border Consortium |year=2007| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070515121040/http://www.tbbc.org/resources.html |archivedate=15 May 2007}}</ref><ref name=priestly>{{cite news |first=Harry |last=Priestly |url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=5380 |title=The Outsiders |publisher=[[The Irrawaddy]] |date=17 January 2006 |accessdate=7 July 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://isrc.payap.ac.th/document/papers/paper23.pdf |title=The Encounter of Missionary Christianity and Resurgent Buddhism in Post-colonial Myanmar |accessdate=14 July 2006 |author=Samuel Ngun Ling |year=2003 |format=PDF |publisher=Payap University |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060302235658/http://isrc.payap.ac.th/document/papers/paper23.pdf |archivedate=2 March 2006}}</ref> More than 200,000 [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] Muslims have settled in Bangladesh, to escape persecution, over the past 20 years. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7019882.stm Burmese exiles in desperate conditions].

89% of the population embraces [[Buddhism]] (mostly [[Theravada]]). Other religions are practiced largely without obstruction, with the notable exception of some ethnic minorities such as the Muslim [[Rohingya people]], who have continued to have their citizenship status denied and therefore do not have access to education, and Christians in Chin State. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90131.htm |title=Burma-International Religious Freedom Report 2007 |publisher=U.S. Department of State}}</ref> 4 percent of the population practices Christianity; 4 percent, Islam; 1 percent, traditional [[animism|animistic]] beliefs; and 2 percent follow other religions, including [[Mahayana Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[East Asian religions]] and the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. <ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bm.html#People CIA Factbook – Burma]. </ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90131.htm |title=International Religious Freedom Report 2007 – Burma |publisher=State.gov |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35910.htm |title=Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs – Background Note: Burma |publisher=State.gov |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref> However, according to a [[U.S. State Department]]'s 2010 international religious freedom report, official statistics are alleged to underestimate the non-Buddhist population.

===Units of measure===. 
{{Main|Burmese units of measurement}}
Burma is one of three countries that still predominantly uses a non-metric system of measure, according to the CIA Factbook. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/appendix/print_appendix-g.html |title=The World Factbook, Appendix G: Weights and Measures |year=2010 |work=Web Pages |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |accessdate=10 May 2010}}</ref>  The common units of measure are unique to Burma, but the government web pages use both imperial units<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moai.gov.mm/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=16&Itemid=2 |title=Ministry of Agriculture and Information |date=2009-2010 |work=Web Page |publisher=Myanmar Agriculture |accessdate=10 May 2010}}</ref> and metric units. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mofa.gov.mm/aboutmyanmar/geography.html |title=About Myanmar : Geography  |year=2009 |work=Web Page |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=10 May 2010}}</ref> . 

==Education==. 
{{Main|Education in Burma}}
[[File:MCbuilding.jpg|thumb|[[Yangon University of Medicine 1]]]] . 

The educational system of Burma is operated by the government agency, the Ministry of Education. Universities and professional institutes from upper Burma and lower Burma are run by two separate entities, the Department of Higher Education of Upper Burma and the Department of Higher Education of Lower Burma. Headquarters are based in Yangon and Mandalay respectively. The education system is based on the United Kingdom's system, due to nearly a century of British and Christian presences in Burma. Nearly all schools are government-operated, but there has been a recent increase in privately funded English language schools. Schooling is compulsory until the end of elementary school, probably about 9 years old, while the compulsory schooling age is 15 or 16 at international level.  . 

There are 101 universities, 12 institutes, 9 degree colleges and 24 colleges in Burma, a total of 146 higher education institutions. <ref>Chronicle of National Development Comparison Between Period Preceding 1988 and after (up to 31 December 2006). </ref>
[[File:Students, Hakha, Chin State, Myanmar.jpg|thumb|left|Students on their way to school, [[Hakha]], [[Chin State]], Burma]]
There are 10 Technical Training Schools, 23 nursing training schools, 1 sport academy and 20 midwifery schools.  . 

There are 2047 Basic Education High Schools, 2605 Basic Education Middle Schools, 29944 Basic Education Primary Schools and 5952 Post Primary Schools. 1692 multimedia classrooms exist within this system.  . 

There are four international schools which are acknowledged by WASC and College Board – [[The International School Yangon]] (ISY), [[Crane International School Yangon]] (CISM), [[Yangon International School]] (YIS) and [[Yangon International Educare Center|International School of Myanmar]] (ISM) in Yangon.  . 

==Media==. 
{{Main|Media of Burma}}
[[Image:Blethrow Inle3.JPG|thumb|Stilt houses at Lake Inle, Burma]] . 

Due to Burma's political climate, there are not many media companies in relation to the country's population, although a certain number exists. Some are privately owned, but all programming must meet with the approval of the censorship board.  . 

Burma is the primary subject of a 2007 graphic novel titled ''[[Chroniques Birmanes]]'' by [[Quebec City|Québécois]] author and animator, [[Guy Delisle]]. The graphic novel was translated into English under the title ''[[Burma Chronicles]]'' in 2008. In 2009, a documentary about Burmese [[videojournalist]]s called ''[[Burma VJ]]'' was released. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://burmavjmovie.com/ |title=Burma VJ&nbsp;– Academy Award Nominee&nbsp;– Best Documentary Feature |publisher=Burmavjmovie.com |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref> This film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Best Documentary Feature]] at the [[82nd Academy Awards|2010 Academy Awards]]. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://dannyfisher.org/2010/02/02/burma-vj-nominated-for-a-2010-academy-award-for-best-documentary-feature/ |title=Burma VJ Nominated for the 2010 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature " Rev.
