{{Politics of Burma}}
Members of  [[United Nations]] and major international human rights organizations have issued repeated and consistent reports of widespread and systematic human rights violations in [[Burma]]. The [[United Nations General Assembly]] has repeatedly<ref>{{Cite web

International human rights organisations including [[Human Rights Watch]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2004/09/01/burma9290.htm |title=Statement to the EU Development Committee |accessdate=2006-07-11 |author=Brad Adams |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]}}</ref> and [[Amnesty International]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://report2009.amnesty.org/en/regions/asia-pacific/myanmar |title=Amnesty International 2009 Report on Human Rights in Myanmar |accessdate=4 January 2010 |author=Brad Adams |publisher=[[Amnesty International]]}}have repeatedly documented and condemned widespread human rights violations. </ref> . 

Violations of human rights include claims that there is no independent [[judiciary]] in Burma, that the military government restricts Internet access through software-based censorship, limiting the material citizens can access online,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.opennetinitiative.net/studies/burma/ |title=Internet Filtering in Burma in 2005: A Country Study |publisher=OpenNet Initiative}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.burmanet.org/news/2006/06/27/mizzima-news-burma-bans-google-and-gmail-mungpi/#more-4642|title=Burma bans Google and gmail | publisher=BurmaNet News|date=2006-06-27| accessdate=2006-06-28}}</ref> that [[Forced labour]], [[human trafficking]], and [[child labour]] are common,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGASA160201998 |title=Myanmar: 10th anniversary of military repression |accessdate=2006-07-14 |date=1998-08-07 |publisher=[[Amnesty International]]}}</ref>  and that sexual violence is abundantly used as an instrument of control, including systematic rapes and taking of sex slaves as porters for the military. A strong women's pro-democracy movement has formed in exile, largely along the Thai border and in [[Chiang Mai Province|Chiang Mai]]. There is a growing international movement to defend women's human rights issues. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.womenofburma.org/Statement&Release/state_of_terror_report.pdf |format=PDF |title=State of Terror report |accessdate=2007-05-21 |date=2007-02-01 |publisher=[[Women's League of Burma]]}}</ref> . 

The ''Freedom in the World 2004'' report by [[Freedom House]] notes that "The junta rules by decree, controls the judiciary, suppresses all basic rights, and commits human rights abuses with [[impunity]]. Military officers hold all cabinet positions, and active or retired officers hold all top posts in all ministries. Official corruption is reportedly rampant both at the higher and local levels."<ref>[http://www.freedomhouse.org/inc/content/pubs/fiw/inc_country_detail.cfm?country=2901&year=2004&page=0&view=mof&pf]</ref> . 

Brad Adams, director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division, in a 2004 address described the human rights situation in the country as appalling: "Burma is the textbook example of a police state. Government informants and spies are omnipresent. Average Burmese people are afraid to speak to foreigners except in most superficial of manners for fear of being hauled in later for questioning or worse. There is no freedom of speech, assembly or association."<ref>[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2004/09/01/burma9290.htm]</ref> . 

==Forced labour==. 
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Forced Labour in Burma.jpg|thumb|220px|A photograph by Human Rights Documentation Unit shows Karen villagers carrying dry palm leaves for army camps' roofs]] -->
According to the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] several hundred thousand men, women, children and elderly people are forced to work against their will by the administration. Individuals refusing to work may be victims of torture, rape or murder. 
The [[International Labour Organization]] has continuously called on Burma to end the practice of forced labour since the 1960s. In June 2000, the ILO Conference adopted a resolution calling on governments to cease any relations with the country that might aid the junta to continue the use of forced labour.[http://www.ilo.org/public/english/standards/relm/ilc/ilc88/resolutions.htm#I] . 

==Freedom of speech and political freedom==. 
According to Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma), there are now 2,203<ref>{{Cite web| title = List of  Political Prisoners in Burma |url =http://aappb.org/prisoners1.html |accessdate =2010-11-05}}</ref> [[political prisoner]]s in Burma - the number had doubled from 1,100 in 2006 to 2,123 in 2008.  . 

A 2004 [[Amnesty International]] report says that, between 1989 and 2004, more than 1,300 [[political prisoner]]s have been imprisoned after unfair trials. The prisoners, including [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD) leaders [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] and [[U Tin Oo]], have "been wrongfully denied their liberty for peaceful acts that would not be considered crimes under international law", Amnesty International claims. <ref>[http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engasa160112004]</ref> . 

The [[Freedom House]] report notes that the authorities arbitrarily search citizens' homes, intercept mail, and monitor telephone conversations, and that the possession and use of telephones, fax machines, computers, modems, and software are criminalized.  . 

===Trade Unions=== . 

Trade unions were banned when [[General Ne Win]] came to power in 1962. In 2010, amid growing calls for reform to labour laws, unofficial industrial action was taken at a number of garment factories in Rangoon, causing concern at government level. <ref>{{cite web|title=Burma Rejects Labor Union Application|url=http://irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=18796|work=The Irrawaddy website|accessdate=17 October 2011}}</ref> In October 2011, it was announced that trade unions had been legalised by a new law. <ref>{{cite news|title=Burma law to allow labour unions and strikes|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-15303968|accessdate=17 October 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=14 October 2011}}</ref> . 

===Freedom of the press===. 
{{Main|Media of Burma}}
The Burmese media is tightly controlled by the government. Newspapers, journals and other publications are run under the [[Ministry of Information (Burma)|Ministry of Information]] and undergo heavy [[censorship]] before publication. Reporters face severe consequences for criticizing government officials, policy, or even reporting on criticism.  . 

==Freedom of religion==. 
{{Main|Freedom of religion in Burma}}
The authorities generally permitted most adherents of registered religious groups to worship as they choose; however, the Government imposed restrictions on certain religious activities and is accused of abusing the right to freedom of religion.  . 

==State-sanctioned torture and rape==. 
A 2002 report by The Shan Human Rights Foundation and The [[Shan Women's Action Network]], ''License to Rape'', details 173 incidents of [[rape]] and other forms of [[Sexual assault|sexual violence]], involving 625 girls and women, committed by [[Tatmadaw]] (Burmese Army) troops in Shan State, mostly between 1996 and 2001. The authors note that the figures are likely to be far lower than the reality. According to the report, "the Burmese military regime is allowing its troops systematically and on a widespread scale to commit rape with impunity in order to terrorize and subjugate the ethnic peoples of Shan State." Furthermore, the report states that "25% of the rapes resulted in death, in some incidences with bodies being deliberately displayed to local communities. 61% were gang-rapes; women were raped within military bases, and in some cases women were detained and raped repeatedly for periods of up to 4 months."<ref>[http://www.shanland.org/HR/Publication/LtoR/license_to_rape.htm]</ref> The Burmese government denied the report's findings, stating that insurgents are responsible for violence in the region. <ref name="LAT">{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/nov/13/nation/na-refugees13 |title=Personal Tales of Struggle Resonate With President |author=Warren Vieth |date=13 November 2005 |work= |publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' |accessdate=2 May 2011}}</ref> . 

In a 2003 report "No Safe Place: Burma's Army and the Rape of Ethnic Women", [[Refugees International]] further documents the widespread use of rape by Burma’s soldiers to brutalize women from five different ethnic nationalities. <ref>[http://www.refintl.org/content/publication/detail/3023/]</ref> . 

Human rights organizations such as Amnesty International also report frequent torture of prisoners, including political prisoners.  . 

==Children's rights==. 
According to [[Human Rights Watch]] [http://hrw.org/reports/2002/burma/], recruiting and [[kidnapping]] of children to the [[military]] is commonplace. An estimated 70,000 of the country’s 350,000-400,000 soldiers are children. There are also multiple reports of widespread [[child labor|child labour]].  . 

==Cases==. 
In a press release of December 16, 2005 the US State Department says UN involvement in Burma is essential. <ref name="autogenerated1">[http://usinfo.state.gov/eap/Archive/2005/Dec/19-674976.html U.N. Involvement in Burma "Essential," State Department Says &ndash; US Department of State]</ref> The US listed illicit narcotics, human rights abuses and political repression as serious problems that the UN needs to address. <ref name="autogenerated1" /> . 

In a landmark legal case, some human rights groups have sued the [[Unocal]] corporation, previously known as Union Oil of California and now part of the [[Chevron Corporation]]. They charge that since the early 1990s, Unocal has joined hands with dictators in Burma to turn thousands of citizens there into virtual slaves under brutality. Unocal, before being purchased, stated that they had no knowledge or connection to these alleged actions although it continued working in Burma. This was believed to be the first time an American corporation has been sued in a U.S. court on the grounds that the company violated human rights in another country. <ref>[http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/burma/ American Radio Works &ndash; Blood and Oil in Burma<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.burmalibrary.org/reg.burma/archives/199606/msg00327.html Burma oil campaign<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . 

According to [[Human Rights Defenders and Promoters]] (HRDP), on April 18, 2007, several of its members (Myint Aye, Maung Maung Lay, Tin Maung Oo and Yin Kyi) were met by approximately a hundred people led by a local official, U Nyunt Oo, and beaten up. Due to the attack, Myint Hlaing and Maung Maung Lay were badly injured and subsequently hospitalized. The HRDP alleged that this attack was condoned by the authorities and vowed to take legal action. [[Human Rights Defenders and Promoters]] was formed in 2002 to raise awareness among the people of Burma about their [[human rights]].  . 

==Minorities==. 
{{Main|Internal conflict in Burma|Persecution of Muslims in Burma}}
Evidence has been gathered suggesting that the Burmese regime has marked certain ethnic minorities such as the [[Karen people|Karen]] for extermination or 'Burmisation'. <ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/burmamyanmar/1492726/Burma%27s-%27slow-genocide%27-is-revealed-through-the-eyes-of-its-child-victims.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Anton | last=La Guardia | title=Burma's 'slow genocide' is revealed through the eyes of its child victims | date=2005-06-24}}</ref> This, however, has received little attention from the international community since it has been more subtle and indirect than the mass killings in places like [[Rwanda]]. <ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/burmamyanmar/1512149/New-evidence-backs-claims-of-genocide-in-Burma.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Mike | last=Thomson | title=New evidence backs claims of genocide in Burma | date=2006-03-05}}</ref> . 

According to [[Amnesty International]], the Muslim [[Rohingya people]] have continued to suffer [[human rights]] violations under the Burma [[Military dictatorship|junta]] since 1978, and many have fled to neighbouring [[Bangladesh]] as a result<ref>[http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA160052004?open&of=ENG-MMR Burma - The Rohingya Minority: Fundamental Rights Denied], [[Amnesty International]], 2004. </ref> .
