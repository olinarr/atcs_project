The '''2007 Burmese anti-government protests''' were a series of anti-government protests that started in [[Burma]] (also known as Union of Myanmar) on 15 August 2007. The immediate cause of the protests was mainly the unannounced decision of the ruling [[military junta|junta]], the [[State Peace and Development Council]], to remove [[fuel subsidies]], which caused the price of diesel and petrol to suddenly rise as much as 66%,<ref name="August, 2007 Burma">{{cite web|title= Human Rights Concern|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/all-countries/myanmar-burma/page.do?id=1011205|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5gpOoktqH|archivedate=16 May 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=7 Apr. 2009}}</ref> and the price of [[compressed natural gas]] for buses to increase fivefold in less than a week. <ref name="Fuel">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6947251.stm Burma leaders double fuel prices]</ref> . 

Led by students and opposition political activists, including women, the protest demonstrations took the form of a campaign of [[nonviolent resistance]], sometimes also called [[civil resistance]]. <ref>Christina Fink, “The Moment of the Monks: Burma, 2007”, in [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]] and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present'', Oxford University Press, 2009, .

[[File:2007 Myanmar protests.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Protesting monks gathering at the Shwedagon Pagoda in [[Yangon]]]]
The phrase "Saffron Revolution" connects the protests against Myanmar’s military dictatorship to the saffron-colored robes widely associated with [[Buddhist]] monks, who were at the forefront of the demonstrations. <ref>{{Cite news |quote=Which meant that to the public the Monks and their religion played an important role throughout the protest. Along with the monks were nuns, students and activists who were protesting during the revolution. |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article2516773.ece |title=Nuns join monks in Burma's Saffron Revolution |work=The Times |location=London  |date=24 Sep. 2007 |first=Richard |last=Lloyd Parry | accessdate= 10 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> However, this nomenclature is misleading as the majority of monks in Burma wear maroon, not saffron-colored robes. While [[color revolution|similar phrases]] had been used previously to describe the process of gradual or peaceful revolution in other nations, this seems to be the first time it has been associated with a particular protest as it is unfolding, and the international press seized upon it in reporting on the Burmese protests. <ref>[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]: ''[http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2006/11/fakhravar.html Has Washington Found its Iranian Chalabi?]'' 6 October 2006</ref> However, the idea that the monkhood is connected to [http://homepages.tesco.net/~ghoutman/chapter_11.htm#11.3 specifically Burmese ideas about revolution] has been argued by Gustaaf Houtman, partly in critique of an alternative view held by a political scientist, that Gen. Ne Win's revolution was the only successful revolution in Burma. Burmese concepts of "revolution," however, have a much longer history and are also employed in many but not all monastic ordinations.  .

{{Main|Timeline of the 2007 Burmese anti-government protests}} . 

===Prologue===. 
Prior to the summer protests, there had been growing unease in the population regarding the economic distress of the country which has stagnant economic growth and is ranked among the 20 poorest countries in the world according to the United Nations. <ref name=autogenerated5>Michael Casey, [http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iofx72HB6-rwZnXsnhgbYbIpkVFQ Monks Put Myanmar Junta in Tight Spot], Associated Press, 21 September 2007. </ref> Many, including the United Nations have blamed the economic problems on the leadership of the military junta and the proportion of national income spent on the armed forces. <ref name=autogenerated5 /><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7023548.stm/ The hardship that sparked Burma's unrest] BBC, 2 October 2007 {{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref> In late 2006, the cost of basic commodities began rising sharply in Burma with rice, eggs, and cooking oil increasing by 30–40%.  According to the UN, one in three children is chronically malnourished, government spending on health and education is among the lowest anywhere in the world, and the average income is below $300 a year.  Living a privileged, parallel existence, Burma's military forces appear virtually a "state within a state", free from the economic insecurity that afflicts the rest of the country. Many of the high ranking army generals have become immensely rich; as witnessed in the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6YPsycc6Lc video] of the wedding of senior general [[Than Shwe]]'s daughter, who is shown wearing diamonds worth many millions of dollars. <ref name=autogenerated1>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7023548.stm The hardship that sparked Burma's unrest] ''BBC News'' 2 October 2007</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6109356.stm Burma leader's lavish lifestyle aired] BBC, 2 November 2006</ref> . 

According to the BBC, on 22 February 2007, a small group of individuals protested the current state of consumer prices in the country. While the protest was small and careful not to be seen as directed at the military junta, officials jailed nine of the protesters. It was the first street protest seen in Rangoon for at least a decade. <ref name=autogenerated1 /> According to Jeff Kingston, in his article "Burma's Despair" stated that "Despair and fear are immobilizing a people who yearn for a better life and have fruitlessly risked much for a better government." This shows how afraid the Burmese were to take action in 2007. Not only that but Kingston also states that "The earlier brutal crackdown of 1988-when at least three thousand protesters were killed and thousands more imprisoned and tortured-has burned a place in the collective memory."<ref>(Kingston,J.(2007).Burma's Despair.Critical Asian Studies,''40'',5–6. Retrieved 18 March 2009, from Academic Search Premier database. </ref> . 

===April===. 
The military junta detained eight people on Sunday, 22 April 2007 who took part in a rare demonstration in a Yangon suburb amid a growing military crackdown on protesters. A group of about ten protesters carrying placards and chanting slogans staged the protest Sunday morning in Yangon's Thingangyun township, calling for lower prices and improved health, education and better utility services. The protest ended peacefully after about 70&nbsp;minutes, but plainclothes police took away eight demonstrators as some 100 onlookers watched. The protesters carried placards with slogans such as "Down with consumer prices." Some of those detained were the same protesters who took part in a downtown Yangon protest on 22 February 2007. That protest was one of the first such demonstrations in recent years to challenge the junta's economic mismanagement rather than its legal right to rule. The protesters detained in the February rally had said they were released after signing an acknowledgment of police orders that they should not hold any future public demonstrations without first obtaining official permission. <ref>{{cite news|title=Eight demonstrators detained for rare protest in military-ruled Myanmar |work=International Herald Tribune|date=22 Apr. 2007 |accessdate=23 Apr. 2007 }}</ref> . 

The military government stated its intention to crack down on these human rights activists, according to an 23 April 2007, report in the country's official press. The announcement, which comprised a full page of the official newspaper, followed calls by human rights advocacy groups, including London-based [[Amnesty International]], for authorities to investigate recent violent attacks on rights activists in the country.  . 

Two members of [[Human Rights Defenders and Promoters]], Maung Maung Lay, 37, and Myint Naing, 40, were hospitalized with head injuries following attacks by more than 50 people while the two were working in Hinthada township, Irrawaddy Division in mid-April. On Sunday, 22 April 2007, eight people were arrested by plainclothes police, members of the pro-junta Union Solidarity and Development Association, and the Pyithu Swan Arr Shin (a paramilitary group) while demonstrating peacefully in a Rangoon suburb. The eight protesters were calling for lower commodity prices, better health-care and improved utility services. Htin Kyaw, 44, one of the eight who also took part in an earlier demonstration in late February in downtown Yangon, was beaten by a mob, according to sources at the scene of the protest.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} . 

Reports from opposition activists have emerged in recent weeks saying that authorities have directed the police and other government proxy groups to deal harshly with any sign of unrest in Yangon. "This proves that there is no rule of law [in Burma]," the 88 Generation Students group said in a statement issued today.[Mon 23 April 2007] "We seriously urge the authorities to prevent violence in the future and to guarantee the safety of every citizen."<ref>[http://www.burmanet.org/news/2007/04/23/irrawaddy-burma%e2%80%99s-junta-vows-to-crack-down-on-human-rights-activists-yeni/#more-7395 Irrawaddy: Burma's junta vows to crack down on human rights activists-Yeni] BurmaNet News, 23 Apr. 2007. Retrieved 2007-04-23. {{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref> . 

As of 22 September 2007, the Buddhist monks have withdrawn spiritual services from all military personnel in a symbolic move that is seen as very powerful in such a deeply religious country as Burma. The military rulers seem at a loss as to how to deal with the demonstrations by the monks as using violence against monks would incense and enrage the people of Burma even further, almost certainly prompting massive civil unrest and perhaps violence. However, the longer the junta allows the protests to continue, the weaker the regime looks. The danger is that eventually the military government will be forced to act rashly and doing so will provoke the citizenry even more. Some international news agencies are referring to the uprising as a 'Saffron Revolution'.  . 

===15 August – Removal of fuel subsidies===. 
On 15 August 2007 the government removed subsidies on fuel causing a rapid and unannounced increase in prices. <ref name=autogenerated1 /> The government, which has a monopoly on fuel sales, raised prices from about $1.40 to $2.80 a gallon, and boosted the price of natural gas by about 500%. <ref name=autogenerated5 /> This increase in fuel prices led to an increase in food prices. Soon afterwards, protesters took to the streets to protest the current conditions. <ref name=autogenerated1 /> . 

While the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]] had been recommending the lifting of subsidies for some time to allow for a [[free market]] to determine fuel prices,<ref name="IMF">[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/IH24Ae03.html Fuel price policy explodes in Myanmar]</ref><ref name="IMF2">[http://www.pinr.com/report.php?ac=view_report&report_id=688&language_id=1 The Economic Factors Behind the Myanmar Protests] {{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref> these organizations did not recommend removing all of the subsidies unannounced. <ref name=autogenerated1 /> The fuel is sold by Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise, a [[state monopoly|state-owned]] fuel company.  . 

===Initial demonstrations=== . 

In response to the increase in fuel prices, citizens protested in demonstrations beginning on 19 August. <ref name=autogenerated5 /> In response to the protests, the government began arresting and beating demonstrators. <ref name=autogenerated5 /> The government arrested 13 prominent Burmese dissidents including [[Min Ko Naing]], [[Ko Ko Gyi]], [[Min Zeya]], [[Ko Jimmy]], [[Ko Pyone Cho]], [[Arnt Bwe Kyaw]] and [[Ko Mya Aye]]. <ref name=autogenerated4>Glenn Kessler, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/22/AR2007082202488_pf.html U.S. Condemns Burmese Arrests Of 13 Dissidents: Sharp Increases in Prices Spur Protests] Washington Post, 23 August 2007</ref> The government newspaper New Light of Myanmar reported that these individuals actions caused civil unrest that "was aimed at undermining peace and security of the State and disrupting the ongoing National Convention. <ref name=autogenerated4 /> The United States condemned the arrest of these dissidents on 22 August with the State Department's acting spokesman stating "The United States calls for the immediate release of these activists and for an end of the regime's blatant attempt to intimidate and silence those who are engaged in peaceful promotion of democracy and human rights in Burma...We call on the regime to engage in a meaningful dialogue with the leaders of Burma's democracy movement and ethnic minority groups and to make tangible steps toward a transition to civilian democratic rule."<ref name=autogenerated4 /> . 

On 5 September 2007, Burmese troops forcibly broke up a peaceful demonstration in [[Pakokku]] and injured three monks. The next day, younger monks in Pakokku briefly took several government officials hostage in retaliation. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7010202.stm Q&A: Protests in Burma] BBC, 24 September 2007</ref> They demanded an apology by the deadline of  17 September  but the military refused to apologize. This sparked protests involving increasing numbers of monks in conjunction with the withdrawal of religious services for the military. Their role in the protests was significant due to the reverence paid to them by the civilian population and the military. After these events, protests began spreading across Myanmar, including Yangon (also known as '''Rangoon'''), [[Sittwe]], Pakokku and [[Mandalay]]. <ref name=MONKS-LEAD-LARGEST-PROTEST>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7009825.stm Monks lead largest Burma protest] BBC, 24 September 2007. </ref> . 

On 21–22 August 2007, participants of the protests on 19 August were detained by local authorities. Their houses were searched without a warrant. These demonstrators could have been charged with up to one year in prison; under the 5/96 Law, that is used to condemn those who disrupt the stability of the state. <ref name="August, 2007 Burma"/> . 

===Escalation===.

[[File:2007 Myanmar protests 4.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Protesters at Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon.]]
On  25 September  the junta threatened demonstrators with military force and placed army trucks at Shwedagon Pagoda, the assembly point for monks leading the protests. Witnesses said 5,000 monks and laypeople marched into the Shwedagon. Civilians were forming a [[human shield]] around the monks; Reuters quotes one eyewitness: "They are marching down the streets, with the monks in the middle and ordinary people either side – they are shielding them, forming a human chain.". <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7013638.stm ''Burmese riot police attack monks''] BBC News, 9 October 2007</ref> Vehicles mounted with loudspeakers toured central Yangon, blaring warnings of military action.

====28 September====. 
On 28 September, Yangon was emptier than the previous days, as people were afraid of violent reprisals from the army, though many still took to the streets chanting such phrases as "wrongdoers who kill monks" as well as "the military science given by general [[Aung San]] is not supposed to kill the people" (i.e. the military isn't supposed to kill the people). The [[President of the Philippines]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] urged Myanmar to take steps toward democracy. The Philippine President warned Myanmar that the Philippines would stop its financial help to Myanmar if opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was not released. U.S. envoys called on China to use its influence with Myanmar.  . 

The Myanmar government attempted to dampen public awareness and communications around the protests by cutting Internet access. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/web/burma-cuts-web-access/2007/09/28/1190486554032.html|title= Burma cuts web access | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=28 September 2007| accessdate= 10 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> Troops specifically targeted those caught carrying cameras and beat them. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=8787|title=Two Shot in Clash with Troops; People with Cameras Singled Out The Irrawaddy Sept&nbsp;28,&nbsp;2007| accessdate= 10 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> On 28 September, after the killing of Japanese photographer [[Kenji Nagai]] by the junta, Japanese Prime Minister [[Yasuo Fukuda]] said he regretted the killing and demanded a full explanation of his death. The [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] was urged to join the push for a UN mission to Myanmar, while the [[United Nations Security Council]] urged restraint from the government.  . 

There were reports that [[Myanmar Army|Burmese troops]] from central Myanmar had started to march towards Yangon. The troops were from the Central Command based in [[Taungoo]] and the South East Command. It was not clear if the troops were marching to reinforce or to challenge the troops in Yangon for shooting the Buddhist monks. <ref>[http://www.mizzima.com/MizzimaNews/News/2007/Sep/Demon-28-Sep-%202007.html Troops marching to Rangoon] Mizzima News, 28 September 2007. {{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref> . 

Vice Senior-General [[Maung Aye]], [[Than Shwe]]'s second-in-command and the commander in chief of the army, "reportedly disagreed with the violent approach taken against protesters", and was scheduled to meet with [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], who was reportedly taken to Yemon Military Camp on the outskirts of Yangon. <ref>[http://www.irrawaddy.org/ Breaking News] The Irrawaddy, 28 September 2007. </ref> Another report claimed Maung Aye had staged a coup against Than Shwe, that his troops were guarding Aung San Suu Kyi's home, and that diplomatic sources said that Aung San Suu Kyi had been moved to a police academy compound outside Yangon; although no independent confirmation has been made on the report. <ref>[http://www.newsdeskspecial.co.uk/2007/09/coup-claimed-in.html ‘Coup’ claimed in Rangoon] ''The First Post'' Newsdesk special report {{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref> .

====29 September====. 
A report warned that the military would attempt to trick UN envoys by asking their followers to carry out a set-up protest – protesting against the genuine demonstrations, with SPDC followers forcing civilians to join in. The same source stated that attendance of one person per family in some parts of the town was being demanded. In view of the Internet blackout, a group of "88-generation activists" urged the United Nations, along with the United States and United Kingdom embassies in Yangon, to open a one-page [[World Wide Web|Web]] service via [[Wi-Fi]] access to the general public just to submit news photos. The blog site confirmed from different sources that soldiers and police were officially ordered not to shoot at the crowd.  . 

It was also reported that the UN envoys would meet Lieutenant Senior General Maung Aye, the second chief of the junta. <ref name=autogenerated6>{{cite web|url=http://burmamyanmargenocide.blogspot.com/|title=Burma-Myanmar Genocide| accessdate= 10 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

United Nations Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari arrived in Yangon and was due to fly immediately to [[Naypyidaw]] to talk with the junta generals. Eyewitnesses told the BBC that over 1,000 people were demonstrating against the government. There were fresh reports of new violence; the French news agency AFP stated that security forces charged a group of around 100 protesters on the Pansoedan bridge in central Yangon. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7019556.stm New protests on Rangoon streets] BBC News article. </ref> . 

Approximately 5,000 people gathered to demonstrate in Mandalay. The military was reported to have put most monasteries under guard to prevent egress. People gathered at 80th, 84th, 35th, and 33rd Streets, before joining together; three military trucks followed them and tried to break up the demonstrators, arresting one student who attempted to cross the road in front of them. The military forced monks from outside Mandalay to return to their native towns, the military keeping the homes of NLD Party leaders under guard. Peaceful demonstrations were reported in Mandalay. The Ngwe Kyar Yan Monastery in South Okkalarpa which was subject to a raid some days earlier was under repair, some suggested, in an effort to eliminate evidence. A dedicated group of anti-riot troops was reported to have been formed within Brigate-77 led by Col. Thein Han under Minister Aung Thaung and General Htay Oo's supervision. Agricultural Minister General [[Maung Oo]] and Minister of Information Brig. General [[Kyaw Hsan]] was said to be in charge of arresting monks at night. <ref name=autogenerated6 /> .

Many of the exodus are from the Christian minority ethnic [[Chin people]] who say they have been persecuted by the junta for being Christians and non-ethnic Burmese. Although they were initially welcomed in Mizoram after the 1988 military crackdown they now face threats of a pushback, as the [[Mizo people|Mizos]] (who are ethnic cousins of Chins) are now strongly opposing "unrestricted migration from the [[Chin State]]" for fear that they may one day be outnumbered by them. <ref>[http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7058007.stm BBC NEWS | South Asia | Burma minority 'fleeing to India'] BBC, Burma minority 'fleeing to India' Retrieved 24 October 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=76871] The International News (Pakistan) Retrieved 24 October 2007</ref> .

There are also said to be large coils of barbed wire present, in readiness to block streets.  The troop presence coincides with the end of [[Buddhist Lent]], and is thought to be aimed at preventing new protests, though according to Reuters there are no new protest developments.

====2 November====. 
The Burma government is to expel the United Nations' top diplomat in the country, UN officials have said.  The military regime told UN's Burma country chief, [[Charles Petrie (diplomat)|Charles Petrie]], his mandate was not going to be renewed.  It is not clear when he will have to leave.  Mr Petrie is known to have voiced concerns over the [[Military dictatorship|junta]]'s violent break-up of peaceful demonstrations in September: "The events clearly demonstrated the everyday struggle to meet basic needs and the urgent necessity to address the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the country," Mr Petrie's statement said, 24 October, [[United Nations Day]].

Burma's military rulers have given a date for United Nations human rights envoy Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro to begin a five-day visit on 11 and 15 November.  Pinheiro, known officially as the UN's special rapporteur on human rights in Burma, has warned: "If they don't give me full co-operation, I'll go to the plane, and I'll go out."  Pinheiro had been refused entry since 2003.

====Conclusion====. 
{{Original research|section|date=October 2011}}These peaceful protests of September 2007 in Burma were not brought to any significant conclusion. The protests were not brought by opposition groups, or foreign governments. However, the Burmese laypeople, and the monks were frustrated with the economic and political situation of the country. When the time came activists monks successfully brought together the people of Burma to protest. These protests gave sight to many young people to witness first hand the brutality of an authoritarian government, thus making them realize the sacrifices the people had to make while fighting for political changes in Burma. Furthermore, the junta agreed to talk to the opposition because they want a win-win situation for all. The catch was that the opposition groups follow the rules of the government as of now. Despite all of the talks going on between groups, true democratic changes are still far from being obtained, making the political future of the country uncertain. <ref>[http://fletcher.tufts.edu/forum/archives/pdfs/32-1pdfs/Kyaw.pdf] Challenging the Authoritarian State: Buddhist Monks and Peaceful Protests in Burma. vol.32:1 winter 2008.

Speaking before the UN General Assembly, the UN Human Rights Council’s Special Rapporteur Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro said that independent sources reported 30 to 40 monks and 50 to 70 civilians killed as well as 200 beaten. <ref>{{cite press release | title = Myanmar: UN rights expert to probe allegations of abuses during crackdown | publisher=UN News Centre | date = 25 October 2007 | url = http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=24405&Cr=myanmar&Cr1= | accessdate =25 Oct. 2007}}</ref> . 

[[Democratic Voice of Burma]] puts the number of deaths at 138, basing their figure on a list compiled by the 88 Student Generation group in Myanmar. The Executive Director of the DVB, Aye Chan Naing, told the Associated Press that "[t]his 138 figure is quite credible because it is based on names of victims, I also think the figure is accurate because of the pictures coming from inside Burma. The way they were shooting into the crowds with machine guns means dozens of people could have died."<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071001/ap_on_re_as/myanmar_dead___missing_1;_ylt=AsArorhaU7exPZMmVHFsc5SROrgF Groups struggle to tally Myanmar's dead] ''Yahoo News'', 1 October 2007</ref> . 

A report in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' states that "[t]housands of protesters are dead and the bodies of hundreds of executed monks have been dumped in the jungle", the report is based on information provided by Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the report, he is quoted as having said "Many more people have been killed in recent days than you've heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.". <ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=484903&in_page_id=1811&ct=5 Burma: Thousands dead in massacre of the monks dumped in the jungle] ''Daily Mail'', 1 October 2007</ref> .

Reports forwarded by ''Times Online'' stated that the abbot of Ngwe Kyar Yan monastery in north west Yangon was so severely beaten by soldiers "that he died on the spot"; the soldiers had been lining monks up against a wall and smashing each of their heads against the wall in succession before throwing them into trucks. <ref name="TO"/> .

==Internet control==. 
{{See also|Internet in Myanmar}}
The government attempted to block all websites and services that could carry news or information about Myanmar, barring access to web-based email. However bloggers in Yangon succeeded in circumventing the censors, posting pictures and videos on blogs almost as soon as the protests began. Many of these images were picked up by mainstream news organizations, because bloggers had managed to capture images that no one else was able to get. When Aung San Suu Kyi stepped outside her home in Yangon to greet marching monks and supporters on Saturday, the only pictures of the landmark moment were posted on blogs.

{{History of Burma}}
{{Main|International reaction to the 2007 Burmese anti-government protests}}
While most countries expressed support for protests and urged the Junta to implement far-reaching reforms, some key countries, such as the People's Republic of China and India maintained commitment to the notion of noninterference and even showed tacit support to the regime. <ref>[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/world/view_article.php?article_id=90622 Faced with Myanmar protests, China reaffirms nonintervention] Inquierer.net, 25 September 2007. </ref><ref>[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/world/view_article.php?article_id=90444 World urges restraint amid Myanmar protests] AFP, 25 September 2007. </ref> . 

===Sanctions===. 
The United States, European Union, and Canada have imposed a number of sanctions on the junta, including a freeze on bank accounts and restrictions on imports of gems and timber. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7011607.stm personal sanctions] BBC News, 10 October 2007</ref> There is no sign that India and [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] nations are willing to participate in personal sanctions, though the ASEAN asked that it be made by the United Nations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} .

On  27 September  the European Union began considering "targeted reinforced sanctions" against the military junta, with current sanctions already including an arms embargo, asset freezes, and visa and trade bans. Their aim was to back sanctions that did not harm the population. <ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aLXL8X4IobaI&refer=home Pressure Builds on Myanmar as Protesters Are Shot At (Update)] Bloomberg, 27 September 2007. </ref> .

[[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[Desmond Tutu]] urged  to intervene in the ongoing protests in Myanmar. "China, you have leverage – tell those brutal men to stop their brutality," Tutu said at the [[Goteborg Book Fair]] in Sweden. Archbishop Emeritus Tutu said that if China did not take a stance against the military rulers in Myanmar he would "join a campaign to boycott the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympics]]" next year. <ref>[http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=148&a=698244 Desmond Tutu vädjar till Burmas ledare] Dagens Nyheter, 28 September 2007. </ref>
Calls for a boycott of the 2008 Summer Olympic Games grow around the world, as more people began to say that increased pressure on the Chinese government was the best way to support the Burmese people. The British Broadcasting World News TV service aired interviews, e-mails and text messages from many parts of the world supporting the idea and also calling on people to cancel tickets, airline bookings and hotel reservations in Beijing.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} .

An online petition to the Chinese President, Hu Jintao, and the UN Security Council, urging them to "oppose a violent crackdown on the demonstrators" and "support genuine reconciliation and democracy" is being hosted by [[Avaaz.org]]. The petition includes a pledge to hold them "accountable for any further bloodshed". Initially it aimed to receive 500,000 signatures, having achieved that, a new target of 1,000,000 has been set. <ref name="avaaz"/> . 

International Bloggers' Day for Burma, a campaign for bloggers to not post to their blogs, was to be on 4 October. Instead they are being asked to put up a banner, underlined with the words ''Free Burma!''. <ref>[http://www2.free-burma.org/index.php#attend International Bloggers' Day for Burma on  the 4 October] Free Burma!</ref> . 

A worldwide action by bloggers originating in Italy will set a signpost for peace and support the people of Myanmar through the internet. On 4 October 2007 all bloggers and website owners worldwide were called upon to support the "free Burma" campaign by adding a graphic to their website frontdoors and blog only about Myanmar related topics. An internet action likewise has not been reported so far. <ref>[http://www.dariosalvelli.com/2007/09/appello-per-la-birmania-stop-blogging-for-birmania Appello per la Birmania: STOP Blogging for Birmania &#124; Dario Salvelli's Blog]</ref> . 

A Facebook users group, "Support the Monks' protest in Burma", was formed immediately following the first network reports of monks marching past Aung San Suu Kyi's house. The group grew to over 380,000 members by 9 October and 440,000 at its peak. Some members of the group, who later formed into an official organization called [[Burma Global Action Network]] joined the call for a [[Global Day of Action for Burma]] through public demonstrations on 6 October in cities and towns worldwide. 
[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] magazine noted the significance of the grassroots effort in an article asking whether Facebook has given birth to 'open-source politics.'<ref>[http://www.wired.com/politics/onlinerights/news/2007/10/myanmarfacebook 'Open-Source Politics' Taps Facebook for Myanmar Protests]</ref> . 

A campaign labelled "[[Panties for Peace]]" began on 16 October; focussing on the superstitions of Burma’s generals, particularly junta chief Than Shwe, that views contact with any item of women’s wear as depriving them of their power, women throughout the world have been sending packages to Burmese embassies containing panties; the campaign has spread to Australia, Europe, Singapore and Thailand. People in Burma also began to hang pictures of Than Shwe around the necks stray dogs, as it is a very strong insult in Burmese tradition to be associated with a dog, and began to spray anti-junta graffiti in bus and train stations, with slogans such as "killer Than Shwe". <ref>[http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=9048 "Panties for Peace" Campaign Wins Wide Support] ''The Irrawady'' 18 October 2007</ref> .

In order to protect Total's interests, the  government has become an obstacle to any serious strengthening of EU measures against [[Burma]]. The French government has pushed for the junta to be admitted into international associations, defending Total's investments. The global online initiative hosted by [[Avaaz.org]] "to refuse to buy fuel from any Total, Chevron, ELF, FINA, Texaco or Caltex station in our home countries and wherever we travel" was signed by 20,255 people with the aim of delivering 40,000 signatures to the top management of the corporations. <ref>[http://www.avaaz.org/en/burma_corporate No fuel for Burmese Junta] Avaaz's "No Fuel For Burmese Junta" Campaign</ref>
Although [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] and [[Total Oil]] claim that their presence benefits the Burmese population, [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] said in [[Le Monde]] that "Total has become the main supporter of the Burmese military regime." already in 2005. <ref>[http://www.soros.org/initiatives/bpsai/articles_publications/publications/totalbcuk_2005/total_report.pdf "TOTALitarian Oil" Report, The Burma Campaign UK, 2005, PDF]</ref> .
