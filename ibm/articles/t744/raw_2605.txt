The main opposition party [[National League for Democracy]] was re-registered for the by-elections on 13 December 2011 as part of the [[reforms in Burma]] since 2010. NLD leader [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] ran in the seat of [[Kawhmu]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16606608|title=Aung San Suu Kyi registers for Burma election run|date=18 January 2012|work=BBC News|accessdate=15 March 2012}}</ref> which she won and her party won in 40 of the 44 seats they contested (out of 45). <ref>http://www.rfa.org/english/news/burma/elections-04022012160808.html</ref><ref name=ndtvresult>{{cite news|title=Suu Kyi's party wins Myanmar by-election landslide|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/world/suu-kyis-party-wins-myanmar-by-election-landslide-193001|accessdate=2 April 2012|newspaper=[[NDTV]]|date=2 April 2012}}</ref> . 

==Election observers==. 
In February 2012, President [[Thein Sein]] remarked that the government would "seriously consider" allowing Southeast Asian observers from the [[Association of South East Asian Nations]] to observe the election. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/21/us-myanmar-election-idUSTRE81K0GK20120221|title=Myanmar says will consider ASEAN poll observers|last=Petty|first=Martin|date=21 February 2012|work=Reuters|accessdate=15 March 2012}}</ref> The Burmese government confirmed that it had requested for ASEAN election observers to arrive on 28 March, five days before the election. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dvb.no/news/burma-gets-asean-poll-monitor-boost/20949|title=Burma gets ASEAN poll monitor boost|date=20 March 2012|work=Democratic Voice of Burma|accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref> The United States, European Union, China, and [[North Korea]], as well as ASEAN dialogue partners (India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia and Australia), were also invited to observe the election, although it remains unclear the degree of access these international observers will have. <ref name="ap">{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i2MtzOtTrY43akKi2oqIhNEzVIoQ?docId=387f3a0642ad463793fc630c4515a07d|title=Myanmar will allow US, EU monitors for April vote|last=Sopheng Cheang|date=21 March 2012|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-17455883|title=Burma invites US and EU observers to April by-elections|date=21 March 2012|work=BBC News|accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref> The United States sent two election observers and three journalists. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/asia/US-Accepts-Burmas-Invitation-to-Observe-April-Vote-143686666.html|title=US Accepts Burma's Invitation to Observe April 1 Vote|date=21 March 2012|work=Voice of America|accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref> . 

On 13 March 2012, the [[Union Election Commission]], approved political party monitors to monitor polling stations during the election. <ref name="sa">{{cite news|url=http://www.dvb.no/news/uec-okays-poll-monitors/20768|title=UEC okays poll monitors|last=Shwe Aung|date=14 March 2012|work=Democratic Voice of Burma|accessdate=15 March 2012}}</ref> In the previous election, only [[Union Solidarity and Development Party]] monitors had been allowed to observe the elections and ballot counts. <ref name="sa"/> A civilian-led monitoring group, including members of the [[88 Generation Students Group]], will also be scrutinizing election irregularities. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/burma/monitor-03232012154753.html|title=Citizens to Monitor Elections|date=23 March 2012|work=Radio Free Asia|accessdate=24 March 2012}}</ref> . 

==Controversies==. 
Aung Din of the [[US Campaign for Burma]] has said that the Burmese government is exploiting the elections to have Western sanctions lifted as quickly as possible, since a free and transparent election has been one of the conditions set by the European Union and American governments. <ref name="ap"/> Moreover, the [[National League for Democracy]] has pointed out irregularities in voter lists and rule violations by local election committees. <ref name="rfa">{{cite news|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/burma/election-03212012170629.html|title=Western Election Observers Invited|date=21 March 2012|work=Radio Free Asia|accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref> On 21 March 2012, [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] was quoted as saying "Fraud and rule violations are continuing and we can even say they are increasing."<ref name="rfa"/> . 

With regard to the invitations of international election observers, a [[US State Department]] spokesperson said that the Burmese government fell short of expectations to accomodate observers during the entirety of the campaign season (as typically done), which is nearing the end, as a select number of observers were allowed only to observe the election:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=23261|title=Good First Step, But Short of Complete Transparency: US|last=Kha|first=Lalit K.|date=22 March 2012|work=The Irrawaddy|accessdate=24 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2012/03/186587.htm#BURMA|title=Daily Press Briefing|last=Nuland|first=Victoria|date=21 March 2012|work=US Department of State|accessdate=24 March 2012|location=Washington, DC}}</ref> . 

{{cquote|"...it does fall short of international complete transparency on an election, and we hope they’ll continue to keep the system open, and open it further... A full-scale international observation effort would typically include quite a bit of pre-Election Day observation, systematic coverage on Election Day, post-election follow-up, and professional monitors from nongovernmental organizations."}} . 

Asian Network for Free Elections (ANFREL), a Bangkok-based election monitoring organization, has publicly called the election observations inadequate, failing to meet international standards, being too restrictive (only two observers are allowed per government, or five for ASEAN nations), and coming too late (invitations were sent less than two weeks before the election date), all of which which make it logistically impossible to monitor all 48 polling stations. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://anfrel.org/myanmar-election-observation-encouraging-but-inadequate/|title=Myanmar Election Observation Encouraging But Inadequate|first=22 March 2012|work=Asian Network for Free Elections|accessdate=24 March 2012|location=Bangkok}}</ref> On 20 March 2012, Somsri Hananuntasuk, executive director of ANFREL, was deported from Yangon, purportedly for entering the country a tourist visa. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.asiantribune.com/news/2012/03/22/burma%E2%80%99s-election-monitoring-window-dressing|title=Is Burma’s election monitoring a window-dressing?|last=Zin Linn|date=23 March 2012|work=Asia Tribune|accessdate=24 March 2012}}</ref> . 

On 23 March 2012, the three by-elections in [[Kachin State]], namely in the constituencies of [[Mogaung Township|Mogaung]], [[Hpakant Township|Hpakant]] and [[Bhamo Township]]s, were postponed due to the security situation there. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/myanmar-postpones-vote-in-3-of-48-constituencies-because-of-security-concerns/2012/03/23/gIQAJ7cfVS_story.html|title=Myanmar postpones vote in three of 48 constituencies because of security concerns|date=23 March 2012|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=24 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-17491613|title=Burma postpones by-elections in troubled Kachin state|date=23 March 2012|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2 April 2012}}</ref> . 

On 1 April, the opposition [[National League for Democracy]] alleged irregularities, claiming that ballot sheets had been tampered to allow the election commission to cancel the vote for Suu Kyi's party. <ref>{{cite news|title=Myanmar opposition alleges ballot irregularities|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/world/Myanmar+opposition+alleges+ballot+irregularities/6393115/story.html|publisher=[[Montreal Gazette]]|date=1 April 2012}}</ref> .
