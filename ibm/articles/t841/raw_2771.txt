[[File:An Act against Atheism and Blasphemy - Mass Bay Colony 1697.jpg|thumb|right|''"An Act against Atheism and Blasphemy"'' as enacted in 1697 in "His Majesty's PROVINCE of the MASSACHUSETTS-BAY in NEW-ENGLAND" (1759 printing)]]
'''Blasphemy law''' is [[law]] relating to [[blasphemy]], or irreverence toward holy personages, religious artifacts, customs, and beliefs.  . 

Some countries, especially countries which have [[Islam]] as the state religion, regard blasphemy as a serious offence. Pakistan, for example, has legislation which makes execution a penalty for blasphemy.  . 

In place of or in addition to prohibitions against blasphemy, some countries have laws which give redress to those who feel insulted on account of their religion. These laws forbid [[hate speech]], the [[vilification of religion]], or "religious insult".  . 

In some countries, blasphemy is not a crime. In the United States of America, for example, a prosecution for blasphemy would violate the Constitution according to the decision in ''[[Joseph Burstyn, Inc v. Wilson]]''. The United Kingdom abolished its laws in England and Wales against blasphemy in 2008. In Europe, the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] has recommended that countries enact laws that protect the freedom of expression.  . 

==Afghanistan==. 
{{Main|Blasphemy law in Afghanistan}}
An Islamic state, Afghanistan prohibits blasphemy as an offence under [[Sharia]]. Blasphemy may be punished by penalties up to execution by hanging.  . 

==Algeria==. 
{{Main|Blasphemy law in Algeria}}
Although ninety-nine percent of [[Algeria]]'s population is [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]], and the Constitution declares that [[Islam]] is the [[state religion]], Algeria uses legislation rather than Sharia to combat blasphemy against Islam.  . 

==Australia==.

The [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] in Strasbourg adopted on 29 June 2007 Recommendation 1805 (2007) on blasphemy, religious insults and hate speech against persons on grounds of their religion. This Recommendation set a number of guidelines for member states of the [[Council of Europe]] in view of Articles 10 (freedom of expression) and 9 (freedom of thought, conscience and religion) of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. The Assembly held that blasphemy should not be a criminal offence. <ref>[http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta07/EREC1805.htm Recommendation 1805 (2007) of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.]

In 2008, the issue of religious sensibilities arose again. On 30 May 2008, Tampere District Court sentenced [[Seppo Lehto]] to two years and four months in prison for offences which involve [[hate speech]] and blasphemy. The court found Lehto guilty of: defamation, incitement of an ethnic group, and violating the sensibilities of a religion. The judgment said that Lehto had violated the sensibilities of Islam because he had disseminated, with insulting intentions, material which openly blasphemes and desecrates that which Muslims deem holy. <ref name = "Tundra"/> Outraged by the punishment of Lehto, [[Jussi Halla-aho]], a Helsinki councilman, posted to the Internet in 2008 some controversial remarks about Islam and about [[Somalia|Somalis]].

==Greece==. 
Articles 198, 199, and 201 of the Greek Penal Code create offences which involve blasphemy. Article 198 "Malicious Blasphemy" provides: . 

:''1. One who publicly and maliciously and by any means blasphemes God shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than two years''.  . 

:''2. Except for cases under paragraph 1, one who by blasphemy publicly manifests a lack of respect for the divinity shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than three months''. <ref name = "COE090add2">http://www.venice.coe.int/docs/2008/CDL(2008)090add2-e.asp</ref> .

Article 201 provides: ''One who willfully removes a corpse, parts of a corpse or the ashes of the dead from those who have lawful custody thereof or one who commits an offense with respect to a corpse or acts blasphemously and improperly toward a grave, shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than two years''. <ref name = "COE090add2"/> . 

Greece has not used its laws about blasphemy to protect any religion other than the Greek Orthodox Church, which is the state church of Greece. <ref name = "COE090add2"/>
In December 2003, Greece prosecuted for blasphemy [[Gerhard Haderer]], an Austrian, along with his Greek publisher and four booksellers. Haderer is the author of an illustrated, humorous book entitled ''The Life of Jesus''. The prosecutor contended that the book’s depiction of Jesus as a [[hippie]] was blasphemous. On 13 April 2005, the Court of Appeal of Athens, reversed the judgment of the Court of First Instance, and acquitted Haderer. <ref>http://www.ifex.org/greece/2005/04/25/austrian_author_acquitted_on_appeal/</ref> . 

Greece complements its laws against blasphemy with laws against "religious insult". The laws forbid the creation, display or trade in work that "insults public sentiment" or that "offends people's religious sentiments". The right to redress for a religious insult has so far been restricted to Christians. <ref>http://www.caslon.com.au/blasphemyprofile9.htm</ref><ref>http://www.venice.coe.int/docs/2008/CDL-AD(2008)026-e.asp</ref> .

==Norway==. 
There is a law against blasphemy in Norway, but it is not in use. The famous writer and social activist [[Arnulf Øverland]] was tried in 1933, after giving a speech named Kristendommen - den tiende landeplage ("Christianity - the tenth plague"), but was acquitted. The last person sentenced for blasphemy in Norway was Arnfred Olsen in 1912, and he had to pay a fine of 10 [[Norwegian krone|NOK]].  . 

==Pakistan ==. 
{{Main|Blasphemy law in Pakistan}} . 

[[Pakistan]] has the anti-blasphemy laws that are quite complicated. The law in itself it not much extreme but its implementation has been quite objectionable. Chapter XV of [[Pakistan Penal Code]] deals with '''OFFENCES RELATING TO RELIGION''':<ref>http://www.fmu.gov.pk/docs/laws/Pakistan%20Penal%20Code.pdf</ref>
* §&nbsp; 295. Injuring or defiling place of worship, with Intent to insult the religion of any class. <ref>http://www.fmu.gov.pk/docs/laws/Pakistan%20Penal%20Code.pdf |page=79</ref>

The usual victims are minorities like the [[Ahmadiyya]] and [[Christian]]s but it seems that they are also increasingly Muslims. <ref>{{cite web | last = Ahmed | first = Akbar S. | title = Pakistan's Blasphemy Law: Words Fail Me | publisher = The Washington Post | date = 19 May 2002 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A36108-2002May17&notFound=true  | accessdate = 28 June 2009}}</ref> Persons accused of blasphemy as well as police, lawyers, and judges are often subject to harassment, threats, attacks and murders when blasphemy is the issue. <ref>{{cite web | last = United Nations [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | title = Asma Jahangir | publisher = United Nations | date = 8 October 2008 | url = http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/opinion/articles1920_iccpr/docs/experts_cvs/Jaghanfir%20bis.doc | accessdate = 27 June 2009}}</ref> . 

In November 2008, Pakistan's government appointed [[Shahbaz Bhatti]] as Federal Minister for Minorities, and gave him cabinet rank. Bhatti had promised that the [[Asif Ali Zardari]] government would review Pakistan's blasphemy laws. <ref name="Pak2009">{{cite web | title = Annual Report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom May 2009 | work = Pakistan | publisher = [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]] |date = May 2009| url = http://www.uscirf.gov/images/AR2009/pakistan.pdf | accessdate = 24 June 2009}}</ref> Pakistan has been an active supporter of the campaign by the [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] to create global laws against [[Blasphemy#Blasphemy_and_the_United_Nations|blasphemy]]. <ref name="Pak2009"/>
Bhatti was shot dead on 2 March 2011, by Taliban militants in Islamabad.  . 

==Poland==. 
While [[Poland]]'s penal code makes no reference to any sort of blasphemy law, it states that "Whoever offends religious feelings of other people by publicly insulting an object of religious cult or a place for public holding of religious ceremonies, is subject to a fine, restriction of liberty or loss of liberty for up to 2 years". The article has been used by pro-Church politicians and activists on numerous occasions, whenever they felt their religious feelings had been offended in some way. Opponents of the article maintain that it seriously limits the freedom of speech and effectively prevents any kind of debate on the Church's widespread influence on social and political life of Poland.  . 

==Saudi Arabia==. 
{{Main|Blasphemy law in Saudi Arabia}} . 

Islam is Saudi Arabia's [[state religion]]. The country's monarchy follows Sunni Islam. 
<ref>Annual Report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom May 2009. </ref> The country's laws are an amalgam of rules from Sharia, royal edicts, and [[Fatwa|fatawa]] from the Council of Senior Religious Scholars. Those laws prescribe penalties up to the death penalty for blasphemy. <ref>http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?lang=e&id=4FBA416ABC8805C2802569A600603109</ref> . 

==Spain== . 

The article 525 of the penal law in Spain considers "vilification" of religious "feelings", "dogmas", "beliefs" or "rituals". 
This extension to "dogmas" and "beliefs" makes it very close to a blasphemy law in practice, depending on the interpretation of the judge.  . 

For instance, in 2012 it has been used to prosecute a famous artist, [[Javier Krahe]], for a homemade video (shot 34 years ago and lasting just 54 seconds) with a fine of 192,000 euros. <ref>http://www.publico.es/espana/314232/juicio-oral-contra-javier-krahe-por-su-corto-como-cocinar-a-un-cristo</ref> . 

==Sudan==. 
Sudan has Sunni Islam as its state religion. About seventy percent of the country's population is Muslim. The next largest group—about twenty-five percent of the population—is [[animist]]. <ref>{{cite web

Section 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Act prohibits "insulting religion, inciting hatred and showing contempt for religious beliefs." The section includes as penalties: imprisonment, a fine, and a maximum of forty [[lashes]]. In November 2007, the section gave rise to the [[Sudanese teddy bear blasphemy case]]. In December 2007, the section was used against two Egyptian booksellers. They were sentenced to six months in prison because they sold a book that the court deemed an insult to Aisha, one of [[Prophet Mohammed]]'s wives. <ref>{{cite web

In May 2005, the authorities arrested Mohammed Taha Mohammed Ahmed, and charged him with violating section 125. Ahmed was the editor-in-chief of a daily newspaper ''Al-Wifaq''. The paper had published an article about a 500-year-old Islamic manuscript which says the real name of Mohammed’s father was not Abdallah but Abdel Lat, or ''Slave of Lat'', an idol of the pre-Islamic era. <ref>{{cite web

==United Kingdom==. 
{{Main|Blasphemy law in the United Kingdom}} . 

Blasphemy laws in the United Kingdom were specific to blasphemy against Christianity. The last attempted prosecution under these laws was in 2007 when the fundamentalist group [[Christian Voice (UK)|Christian Voice]] sought a [[private prosecution]] against the [[BBC]] over its broadcasting of the show [[Jerry Springer: The Opera]] (which includes a scene depicting Jesus, dressed as a baby, professing to be "a bit gay"). The charges were rejected by the [[City of Westminster]] magistrates court. Christian Voice applied to have this ruling overturned by the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], but the application was rejected. The court found that the [[common law]] blasphemy offences specifically did not apply to stage productions (s. 2(4) of the [[Theatres Act 1968]]) and broadcasts (s.&nbsp;6 of the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]]). <ref>{{cite news

The last successful blasphemy prosecution (also a private prosecution) was [[Whitehouse v. Lemon]] in 1977, when Denis Lemon, the editor of [[Gay News]], was found guilty. His newspaper had published [[James Kirkup]]'s poem [[The Love that Dares to Speak its Name]], which allegedly vilified [[Christ]] and his life. Lemon was fined £500 and given a [[suspended sentence]] of nine months imprisonment. It had been "touch and go", said the judge, whether he would actually send Lemon to jail. <ref>[http://www.pinktriangle.org.uk/glh/214/humphreys.html Brett Humphreys: ''The Law That Dared to Lay the Blame'']</ref> In 2002, a deliberate and well-publicised public repeat reading of the poem took place on the steps of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] church in [[Trafalgar Square]], but failed to lead to any prosecution.  . 

The last person in Britain to be imprisoned for blasphemy was [[John William Gott]] on 9 December 1921. He had three previous convictions for blasphemy when he was prosecuted for publishing two pamphlets which satirised the biblical story of Jesus entering Jerusalem (Matthew 21:2-7), comparing Jesus to a circus clown. He was sentenced to nine months' hard labour.  . 

The last prosecution for blasphemy in Scotland was in 1843. <ref>Hugh Barclay: ''A Digest of the Law of Scotland: With Special Reference to the Office'', T & T Clark, Edinburgh, 1855, p.86</ref> In 1697, a Scottish court hanged [[Thomas Aikenhead]] for blasphemy.  . 

On 5 March 2008, an amendment was passed to the [[Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]] which abolished the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel in England and Wales. (Common law is abolished, not repealed.) The Act received royal assent on 8&nbsp;May 2008,<ref>{{cite web| accessdate = 6 June 2008|publisher=Institute for Humanist Studies|author=Ruth Geller|title=Goodbye to Blasphemy in Britain|url =http://humaniststudies.org/enews/?id=348&article=0 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080607204857/http://humaniststudies.org/enews/?id=348&article=0 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 7 June 2008}}</ref><ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2008/ukpga_20080004_en_1 Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008], see section 79 and Part 5 of Schedule 28. </ref> and the relevant section came into force on 8 July 2008. <ref>[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/03/uk-house-of-lords-votes-to-abolish.php JURIST - Paper Chase: UK House of Lords votes to abolish criminal blasphemy<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2008/ukpga_20080004_en_17#pt12-l1g153 Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008], section 153: Commencement</ref> . 

The 1989 film [[Visions of Ecstasy]] was the only film ever banned in the UK for blasphemy. Following the 2008 repeal of the blasphemy law, the film was eventually classified by the BBFC for release as 18-rated in 2012. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16809977|title= Visions Of Ecstasy gets UK rating after 23 year ban|date=2012-01-31}}</ref> . 

==United States of America==. 
{{Main|Blasphemy law in the United States of America}} . 

A prosecution for blasphemy in the United States would fail as a violation of the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]]. The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] provides: <blockquote>"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or '''abridging the freedom of speech''', or of the press . . . ."</blockquote> . 

Because of the First Amendment's protection of free speech and religious exercise from federal interference, and the Fourteenth Amendment's extension of those protections against state regulation, the United States and its constituent state governments may not prosecute blasphemous speech or religious insults and may not allow civil actions on those grounds. In ''[[Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that New York could not enforce a censorship law against filmmakers whose films contained "sacrilegious" content. The opinion of the Court, by Justice Clark, stated that: <blockquote>"from the standpoint of freedom of speech and the press, it is enough to point out that the state has no legitimate interest in protecting any or all religions from views distasteful to them which is sufficient to justify prior restraints upon the expression of those views. It is not the business of government in our nation to suppress real or imagined attacks upon a particular religious doctrine, whether they appear in publications, speeches, or motion pictures."<ref>[http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0343_0495_ZO.html Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U.S. 495 (1952)]</ref></blockquote> . 

It should be noted, however, that the United States and some individual state jurisdictions provide for stronger criminal penalties for crimes when committed against a person because of that person's religious affiliation. For instance, Section 3A1.1 of the 2009 United States Sentencing Guidelines states that: "If the finder of fact at trial or, in the case of a plea of guilty or [[nolo contendere]], the court at sentencing determines beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intentionally selected any victim or any property as the object of the offense of conviction because of the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, gender, disability, or sexual orientation of any person," the sentencing court is required to increase the standard sentencing range. <ref>[http://www.ussc.gov/2009guid/GL2009.pdf United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual § 3A1.1 (2009)]</ref> . 

==Yemen==. 
{{Main|Blasphemy law in Yemen}} . 

Accusations of blasphemy in Yemen serve the same purpose there as elsewhere. The accusations victimize religious minorities, intellectuals and artists, reporters and human rights defenders, and opponents of the ruling clique. If vigilantism or abuse by the authorities does not kill an accused or force an accused into exile, the accused in Yemen will be subject to Islamic law (Sharia). Sharia, according to some interpretations, prescribes death as the proper punishment for blasphemy. <ref>http://shiaonline.wordpress.com/apostasy-and-blasphemy-in-islam/</ref><ref>http://www.iheu.org/node/1541</ref><ref>[http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?lang=e&id=4FBA416ABC8805C2802569A600603109 Amnesty International Report on Saudi Arabia 2007]. </ref><ref>[http://thereport.amnesty.org/en/regions/middle-east-north-africa/saudi-arabia Amnesty International Report on Saudi Arabia 2009]. </ref> .
