In the [[United States]], a law against [[blasphemy]], or a prosecution on that ground, would fall afoul of the [[Constitution of the United States|American Constitution]]. The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] provides "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press..." While there are no federal laws which forbid "religious vilification" or "religious insult" or "[[hate speech]]", some states have blasphemy statutes.  .

:[http://mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/272-36.htm Section 36]. Whoever willfully blasphemes the holy name of God by denying, cursing or contumeliously reproaching God, His creation, government or final judging of the world, or by cursing or contumeliously reproaching Jesus Christ or the Holy Ghost, or by cursing or contumeliously reproaching or exposing to contempt and ridicule, the holy word of God contained in the holy scriptures shall be punished by imprisonment in jail for not more than one year or by a fine of not more than three hundred dollars, and may also be bound to good behavior.  . 

The history of Maryland's blasphemy statutes suggests that even into the 1930s, the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] was not recognized as preventing states from passing such laws. An 1879 codification of Maryland statutes prohibited blasphemy:  . 

:[http://www.mdarchives.state.md.us/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000388/html/am388--824.html Art. 72, sec. 189]. If any person, by writing or speaking, shall blaspheme or curse God, or shall write or utter any profane words of and concerning our Saviour, Jesus Christ, or of and concerning the Trinity, or any of the persons thereof, he shall, on conviction, be fined not more than one hundred dollars, or imprisoned not more than six months, or both fined and imprisoned as aforesaid, at the discretion of the court.  . 

According to the marginalia, this statute was adopted in 1819, and a similar law dates back to 1723. In 1904, the statute was still on the books at 
[http://www.mdarchives.state.md.us/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000393/html/am393--782.html Art. 27, sec. 20], unaltered in text. As late as 1939, this statute was still [http://www.mdarchives.state.md.us/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000379/html/am379--1100.html the law of Maryland]. But in 1972, in ''Maryland v. Irving K. West'', the [[Maryland Court of Appeals]] (the state's highest court) declared the blasphemy law unconstitutional. <ref> "Blasphemy Laws" in Gordon Stein, editor, ''The Encyclopedia of Unbelief'', page 61. Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books, 1985. </ref> This law was still on the books however at least as late as 2003. <ref>Maryland Criminal Law and Motor Vehicle Handbook. (Longwood: Gould Publications, 2002), Art. 27, section 20. Blasphemy. </ref> . 

Pennsylvania enacted a law against blasphemy in 1977. In the fall of 2007, George Kalman sent the completed forms for incorporating a company to the Pennsylvania Department of State. Kalman wanted to incorporate a movie-production company which he called ''I Choose Hell Productions, LLC''. A week later, Kalman received a notice from the Pennsylvania Department of State which informed him that his forms could not be accepted because a business name “may not contain words that constitute blasphemy, profane cursing or swearing or that profane the Lord’s name.” In February 2009, Kalman filed suit to have the provision against blasphemy struck down as unconstitutional. <ref name = "NYT"/>  On June 30, 2010, U.S. District Judge Michael M. Bayslon of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, in a 68-page Opinion, ruled in favor of Kalman, finding that the Pennsylvania's blasphemy statute violated both the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. <ref>http://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents/opinions/10D0634P.pdf</ref> . 

==Prosecution for blasphemy==. 
The last person to be jailed in the United States for blasphemy was [[Abner Kneeland]] in 1838 (a Massachusetts case: ''[[Commonwealth v. Kneeland]]''). <ref>"Kneeland, Abner" in Gordon Stein, editor, ''The Encyclopedia of Unbelief'', pp. 379-380. Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books, 1985. </ref> The Kneeland case preceded the ratification (1868) of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]], which [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporated]] the Bill of Rights and made it apply to the states and not just to the federal government. From 1925, the Supreme Court applied the Bill of Rights to all states. <ref>"Blasphemy" in Tom Flynn, editor, ''The New Encyclopedia of Unbelief'', p. 147. Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books, 2007. </ref> . 

The last U.S. ''conviction'' for blasphemy—at least that of any significance—was of atheist activist [[Charles Lee Smith]]. In 1928 he rented a storefront in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], and gave out free atheist literature there. The sign in the window read: "Evolution Is True. The Bible's a Lie. God's a Ghost." For this he was charged with violating the city ordinance against blasphemy. Because he was an atheist and therefore couldn't swear the court's religious oath to tell the truth, he wasn't permitted to testify in his own defense. The judge then dismissed the original charge, replacing it with one of distributing obscene, slanderous, or scurrilous literature. Smith was convicted, fined $25, and served most of a twenty-six-day jail sentence. His high-profile [[fast]] while behind bars drew national media attention. Upon his release, he immediately resumed his atheist activities, was again charged with blasphemy, and this time the charge held. In his trial he was again denied the right to testify and was sentenced to ninety days in jail and a fine of $100. Released on $1,000 bail, Smith appealed the verdict. The case then dragged on for several years until it was finally dismissed. <ref> "Smith, Charles Lee" in Gordon Stein, editor, ''The Encyclopedia of Unbelief'', pp. 633-634. Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books, 1985. </ref> . 

==Joseph Burstyn, Inc v. Wilson==. 
The US Supreme Court in ''[[Joseph Burstyn, Inc v. Wilson]]'', 343 U.S. 495 (1952) held that the New York State blasphemy law was an unconstitutional prior restraint on freedom of speech. The court stated that "It is not the business of government in our nation to suppress real or imagined attacks upon a particular religious doctrine, whether they appear in publications, speeches or motion pictures." .
