In the '''[[Republic of Ireland]]''', '''[[blasphemy]]''' is required to be prohibited by Article 40.6.1.i. of the [[Constitution of Ireland|1937 Constitution]]. The [[common law]] [[offence (law)|offence]] of [[blasphemous libel]] was effectively replaced in 2009 by a new offence of "publication or utterance of blasphemous matter". The continued existence of a blasphemy offence is controversial, with proponents of [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of religion]] arguing it should be removed.  . 

==Early history==. 
According to [[Raphael Holinshed|Holinshed's ''Chronicles'']], Adam Duff O'Toole was [[burned alive]] in [[Dublin]] in 1327 for [[heresy]] and blasphemy. <ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.libraryireland.com/biography/AdamDuffOToole.php |chapter=O'Toole, Adam Duff |last=Webb |first=Alfred |authorlink=Alfred Webb |year=1878 |title=A Compendium of Irish Biography |accessdate=19 January 2010 |publisher=Gill & Son |location=Dublin}}</ref><ref>Levy, p.77</ref>   . 

The [[Law of the Republic of Ireland|legal system of Ireland]] grew out of the [[common law]] system of [[English law]]. The common law offence of blasphemous libel applied only to [[Christianity]]. <ref>Keane 1991, §§92,104</ref> Spoken blasphemy was also an offence. <ref name="ohiggins"/> [[Profanity]] was generally regarded by legal scholars as synonymous with blasphemy. <ref name="ohiggins">{{cite journal|last=O'Higgins |first=Paul  |date=March 1960 |title=Blasphemy in Irish Law |journal=The Modern Law Review |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=151–166 |jstor=1091444 }}</ref> The penalty  for a first offence was an unlimited fine and imprisonment; for a second offence it was [[banishment]]. <ref name="dail1961">[http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0191/D.0191.196107260066.html Defamation Bill, 1961—Committee Stage] Dáil Éireann - Volume 191 - 26 July 1961</ref> The [[Anglican]] [[Church of Ireland]] was the [[established church]] from 1536 to [[Irish Church Disestablishment Act 1869|1871]].

There was a prosecution in the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] for blasphemous libel in 1703: Thomas Emlyn, a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister, was fined £1,000 and imprisoned for one year for denying the [[Divinity of Christ]]. <ref>Keane 1991, §14</ref> Other incidents that century did not result in prosecutions. In 1713, [[Peter Browne (theologian)|Peter Browne]], [[bishop of Cork and Ross]] preached that [[loyal toast]]s to "the glorious, pious, and immortal memory" of [[William III of England|King William]] were blasphemous. <ref>{{cite journal |last=Powell |first=Martyn J. |date=13 October 2006 |title=Political Toasting in Eighteenth-Century Ireland |journal=History |publisher=The Historical Association and Blackwell Publishing |volume=91 |issue=304 |pages=508–529 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-229X.2006.00376.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |authorlink=William Edward Hartpole Lecky |last=Lecky |first=William Edward Hartpole |title=A history of Ireland in the eighteenth century |publisher=Longmans, Green & Co |location=London |year=1918 |volume=1 |page=423 |isbn=0543950212 |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/historyofireland01leckuoft#page/422/mode/2up }}</ref> The same year, a [[convocation]] of the Church of Ireland recommended prosecution of [[Robert Molesworth, 1st Viscount Molesworth|Robert Molesworth]] for "an indictable profanation of the holy scriptures", after he had quoted Scripture in the course an insult to their representatives at a [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|viceregal]] [[Levée (event)|levée]]. <ref name="hayton">{{cite book |last=Hayton |first=David |title=Ruling Ireland, 1685-1742: politics, politicians and parties |publisher=Boydell Press |year=2004 |series=Irish historical monographs |volume=1 |pages=179–180 |isbn=1843830582 |url=http://books.google.ie/books?id=izGm9rqaoFcC&lpg=PA180&ots=7U8qZM5MS3&dq=1713%20blasphemy%20ireland&pg=PA179#v=onepage&q=1713%20blasphemy%20ireland&f=false }}</ref><ref>Levy, p.276</ref> In 1756, Robert Clayton, [[Bishop of Clogher]], questioned the [[Nicene Creed]] in a tract on [[religious tolerance]]; he was condemned by other bishops, but died before any prosecution for blasphemy was brought. <ref>Levy, pp.276–7</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=A New and General Biographical Dictionary, containing an historical, critical and impartial account of the lives and writings of the most eminent persons in every nation in the world, particularly the British and Irish, from the earliest accounts of time to the present period |location=London |year=1795 |edition=New |volume=3 |pages=369–71 |chapter=Clayton (Robert) |url=http://books.google.ie/books?id=K6EDAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA370&ots=xJbuhwRO37&dq=bishop%201756%20%22nicene%20creed%22%20%22church%20of%20ireland%22&pg=PA370#v=onepage&q=bishop%201756%20%22nicene%20creed%22%20%22church%20of%20ireland%22&f=false }}</ref> . 

In 1852, in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], John Syngean Bridgman, a [[Franciscan]] friar, was convicted in [[County Mayo]] after [[Book burning|burning]] an [[Authorized King James Version|Authorized King James Bible]]. <ref name="lawreform15">Keane 1991, §15</ref> He viewed it as a [[souperism|souperist]] work inferior to the Catholic [[Douay-Rheims Bible]]. While the indictment described his actions as "in contempt of the Protestant religion", Judge [[Thomas Langlois Lefroy]] advised the jury "it is not the version of the Scriptures which will warrant the commission of such an offence" but rather "a want of reverence to the Scriptures". <ref name="lawreform15"/><ref name="Levy">Levy, p.464</ref> In 1855 at [[Dún Laoghaire|Kingstown]], a Protestant Bible was burned on a bonfire of "irreligious" books organised by Vladimir Petcherine, a Catholic priest. He was acquitted of blasphemy after claiming he had not intended to burn any Bibles. <ref name="lawreform15"/><ref name="Levy"/> . 

==Independence==. 
Common law precedents persisted after the creation in 1922 of the [[Irish Free State]], provided they were consistent with the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State|1922 Constitution]], and later the [[Constitution of Ireland|current (1937) Constitution]]. The last British prosecution till [[Whitehouse v Lemon|1977]] was Bowman v Secular Society Limited in 1917. <ref name="lawreform16">Keane 1991, §16</ref>  The Irish [[Law Reform Commission]]'s 1991 consultation paper on the crime of [[libel]] states, "if a case had arisen between Bowman in 1917 and 1937, it seems likely that an Irish court would have found the views in Bowman persuasive". <ref name="lawreform16"/> . 

Article 40.6.1.i. of the 1937 Constitution states "The publication or utterance of blasphemous, seditious or indecent matter is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law". Article 44.1 states "The State acknowledges that the homage of public worship is due to Almighty God. It shall hold His Name in reverence, and shall respect and honour religion."<ref>[http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/upload/static/256.htm Constitution of Ireland] Department of the Taoiseach</ref>  . 

In 1957, ''[[The Rose Tattoo]]'' was produced at the inaugural [[Dublin Theatre Festival]]. Alan Simpson, owner of the Pike Theatre Club, was prosecuted for "producing for gain an [[indecent]] and profane performance", with [[obscenity]] later added to the charge. <ref>Keane 1991, §§128–132</ref> The play's detractors were concerned by its sexual content rather than religion. <ref name="trotter">{{cite book|last=Trotter |first=Mary |title=Modern Irish Theatre |publisher=Polity |year=2008 |series=Cultural history of literature |volume=11 |pages=134–5 |isbn=0745633439 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AZCIfwnzo7UC&lpg=PT146&ots=pGkHo8jOWG&dq=dublin%201957%20%22The%20Rose%20Tattoo%22&pg=PT146#v=onepage&q=dublin%201957%20%22The%20Rose%20Tattoo%22&f=false }}</ref> The Law Reform Commission's 1991 report comments "the equation of indecency and obscenity with profanity is probably misconceived. Although profane matter may sometimes be obscene or indecent, it is not necessarily so."<ref>Keane 1991, §131</ref> . 

Section 13 of the Defamation Act, 1961 prescribed penalties for blasphemous libel, but did not define the offence,<ref name="act1961">[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1961/en/act/pub/0040/sec0013.html#zza40y1961s13 Defamation Act, 1961, Section 13] Irish statute book</ref> which was presumed still to be the common-law offence. <ref name="dail1961"/> The new maximum penalties were seven years' [[penal servitude]], or two years' [[imprisonment]] and a £500 fine. <ref name="act1961"/> The only attempted prosecution since 1855 was in 1999,<ref>[1999] IESC 5 §24</ref>  when John Corway brought a [[private prosecution]] against [[Independent News & Media|Independent Newspapers]] and ''[[Irish Independent]]'' editor [[Aengus Fanning]] for an [[editorial cartoon]] published during the [[Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|1995 divorce referendum]], which depicted the government parties' leaders snubbing a [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]] who was holding out a [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Communion wafer]]. <ref>[1999] IESC 5 §5</ref> The [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Supreme Court]] ruled that the 1937 Constitution had extinguished the common law offence, stating "It is difficult to see how the common law crime of blasphemy, related as it was to an established Church and an established religion could survive in ... a Constitution guaranteeing freedom of conscience, and the free profession and practice of religion."<ref>[1999] IESC 5 §35</ref>  It refused to allow the prosecution, stating "in the absence of any legislative definition of the constitutional offence of blasphemy, it is impossible to say of what the offence of blasphemy consists ... In the absence of legislation and in the present uncertain state of the law the Court could not see its way to authorising the institution of a criminal prosecution". <ref>[1999] IESC 5 §38</ref> . 

==Defamation Act 2009==. 
The Law Reform Commission's 1991 Report opined that "there is no place for the offence of blasphemous libel in a society which respects freedom of speech."<ref name="lawreform231">Keane 1991, §231</ref> It said the Prohibition of [[Incitement to hatred|Incitement to Hatred]] Act 1989 provided an adequate protection for outrage against religious belief. <ref name="lawreform231"/> However, since banning blasphemy is mandated by the Constitution, abolishing the offence would require a [[referendum]]. A referendum solely for that purpose "would rightly be seen as a time wasting and expensive exercise". <ref>Keane 1991, §232</ref> The Commission's report, therefore, outlined criteria for a statutory definition of blasphemy which could serve until such time as Article 40.6.1.i might be changed as part of a broader Constitutional amendment. <ref>Keane 1991, §245</ref>  The 1996 report of the [[Oireachtas]] Constitution Review Group agreed that "The retention of the present constitutional offence of blasphemy is not appropriate."<ref>[http://www.constitution.ie/reports/crg.pdf Report of the Constitution Review Group, 1996]</ref>  . 

The [[Defamation Act 2009]] (introduced as the Defamation Bill 2006<ref name="defbill2006">{{cite web |url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=/documents/bills28/bills/2006/4306/document1.htm |title=Defamation Bill 2006 [Seanad] (No.43 of 2006) |publisher=Houses of the Oireachtas}}</ref>) implemented many of the recommendations of the Commission's 1991 report. Originally, it omitted reference to blasphemy, pending a review by the Oireachtas [[Joint Committee]] on the Constitution.  In March 2008, [[Brian Lenihan]], then [[Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform]], said:<ref name="seanad2008"/>
:In England and Wales blasphemy traditionally only consisted in the scandalising of the established church. It is probably the case in Ireland, with the enactment of the Article 44 provision in 1937, that blasphemy was extended to cover all of the denominations recognised in the Constitution and that [[Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|in 1972]] it passed into a stage where it extended itself to all [[theism|theistic]] religions, since all theistic religions are honoured by the Constitution, although Christianity is uniquely invoked in the preamble. 
The Joint Committee on the Constitution's report on Article 40.6.1.i. was published in July 2008. The Committee had discussed the case of comedian [[Tommy Tiernan]], whose stand-up routine on ''[[The Late Late Show]]'' parodied the Gospels, offending many viewers. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/DDebate.aspx?F=CNJ20080423.xml&Node=29|title=Joint Committee on the Constitution|date=23 April 2008|work=Parliamentary Debates|publisher=Oireachtas|accessdate=23 October 2010 |page=2}}</ref> The [[Bar Council of Ireland]] made a presentation to the Committee, pointing out that blasphemy and [[treason]] were the only crimes specifically mentioned in the Constitution. <ref name="CommissionMeeting1">{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/DDebate.aspx?F=CNJ20080423.xml&Node=163|title=JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE CONSTITUTION|date=23 April 2008|work=Parliamentary Debates|page=1|accessdate=23 October 2010}}</ref> Neville Cox stated:<ref name="CommissionMeeting1" />
:When the English Parliament originally enacted blasphemy laws, it was with a view to appeasing an angry God who was irritated by despicable literature and who was causing plagues and fires to occur in London. That was the historical reason for the law. The [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission in England]] suggested that there were two types of situation where what had previously been characterised as blasphemous material might generate a public interest in its prohibition. The first is where there is incitement to hatred and the second is where there is simply an excessive offence to religious sensibilities. The term “blasphemy” does not relate to either of these. It is, therefore, a misdescription of a changed law.  . 

The Oireachtas Committee's report concluded:<ref name="jcom40.6.1.i">{{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/committees30thdail/j-constitution/report_2008/100708-Report1.pdf |title=First Report Article 40.6.1.i - Freedom of Expression |last=Joint Committee on the Constitution |date=July 2008|publisher=Houses of the Oireachtas |accessdate=19 January 2010}}</ref> 
:The reference itself has effectively been rendered a "dead letter" by virtue of the decision of the Supreme Court in Corway. Furthermore, the Committee is of the view that in a modern Constitution, blasphemy is not a phenomenon against which there should be an express constitutional prohibition.  . 

On 20 May 2009 at the Bill's [[committee stage]], the section dealing with blasphemy was introduced by Minister for Justice [[Dermot Ahern]] as an amendment. <ref>[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/DDebate.aspx?F=JUS20090520.xml&Page=1&Ex=179#N179 Parliamentary Debates (Official Report - Unrevised) Committee on Justice, Equality Defence and Women's Rights Wednesday, 20 May 2009 - Page 1]</ref>  Section 36 defines a new offence of "Publication or utterance of blasphemous matter",<ref name="law2009">[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0031/sec0036.html 36. Publication or utterance of blasphemous matter.] Defamation Act 2009; Irish statute book</ref> which carries a maximum fine of €25,000. <ref name="law2009"/> The offence consists of uttering material "grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion", when the intent and result is "outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion". <ref name="law2009"/> A [[Defense (legal)|defence]] is permitted for work of "genuine literary, artistic, political, scientific, or academic value". <ref name="law2009"/> "Religion" excludes profit-driven organizations or those using "oppressive [[psychological manipulation]]". <ref name="law2009"/>  . 

Ahern said:<ref>[http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/JELR/Pages/Amending%20the%20Law%20on%20Blasphemous%20Libel%20Speech%20by%20the%20Mr.%20Dermot%20Ahern%20T.D.,%20Minister%20for%20Justice,%20Equality%20and%20Law%20Reform%20at%20the%20Dail%20Committee%20on%20Justice,%20Equality%20Defence%20and%20Women%27s%20Rights%20Wednesday,%2020th%20May,%202009 Amending the Law on Blasphemous Libel] Dermot Ahern, Dáil , 20 May 2009</ref>
:I am ... puzzled as to the hysterical and incorrect reaction whipped up by some media reporters and commentators on this point. ... I as the responsible Minister, and we as legislators, do not have the luxury of pursuing a "do nothing" approach while we wait for an opportune moment to move a constitutional amendment.  . 

President [[Mary McAleese]] convened the [[Council of State (Ireland)|Council of State]] to discuss whether the Bill should be referred to the Supreme Court to test its Constitutionality; she decided not to do so. <ref name="Coulter17032010"/> The Bill became Law on 23 July 2009,<ref name="defbill2006"/> and came into effect on 1 January 2010. <ref>[http://www.attorneygeneral.ie/esi/2009/B27320.pdf Defamation Act (Commencement) Order 2009] S.I. No. 517 of 2009; Attorney-General's office</ref> . 

==Proposed referendum==. 
The advocacy group [[Atheist Ireland]] responded to the enactment by announcing the formation of the "Church of Dermotology". <ref>{{cite web |url=http://blasphemy.ie/2009/05/26/join-the-church-of-dermotology/ |title=Join the Church of Dermotology |first=Michael |last=Nugent |work=blasphemy.ie |publisher=Atheist Ireland |date=26 May 2009 |accessdate=18 January 2010 }}</ref> On the date on which the law came into effect, Atheist Ireland published a series of potentially blasphemous quotations on its website and vowed to challenge any resulting legal action. It also said that it would be holding a series of public meetings to launch a campaign for secular constitutional reform. <ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jan/01/irish-atheists-challenge-blasphemy-law Irish atheists challenge new blasphemy laws] - The Guardian, Friday, January 1, 2010</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8437460.stm Irish atheists challenge blasphemy law] - BBC News, Saturday, January 2, 2010</ref> . 

In March 2010, Ahern's press officer said the minister might ask [[Government of the 30th Dáil|the cabinet]] to hold a referendum to remove the reference to blasphemy from the Constitution in autumn 2010, at the same time tentatively planned for a referendum on an amendment relating to [[children's rights]]. <ref name="Coulter17032010">{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0317/1224266442534.html|title=Ahern to propose blasphemy amendment|last=Coulter|first=Carol|date=17 March 2010|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=23 October 2010}}</ref> Asked about this in the Dáil, Ahern did not offer any commitment, but said:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/DDebate.aspx?F=DAL20100325.xml&Node=H9-2|title=Referendum on Blasphemy|date=25 March 2010|work=Parliamentary Debates (Official Report - Unrevised)|publisher=Dáil Éireann|page=11|accessdate=23 October 2010}}</ref>
:the programme for Government did indicate the possibility of referendums on a number of issues ... If we were to have a number of referendums on one day, it would be appropriate to put to the people a question on the section of the Constitution relating to blasphemous and seditious libel.  . 

In the event, no referendums were held before the dissolution of the [[30th Dáil]] in January 2011. Before [[Irish general election, 2011|the ensuing general election]], Atheist Ireland asked parties "Do you believe that blasphemy should be a criminal offence?" [[Fine Gael]], [[Sinn Féin]], and the [[Workers' Party (Ireland)|Workers' Party]] said no, while [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour]] and the [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] supported a referendum to remove the constitutional requirement. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atheist.ie/information/2011-general-election/|title=How did the parties and candidates reply to our questions on secular policies?|last=Nugent|first=Michael|date=23 February 2011|work=[[Atheist Ireland]]|accessdate=10 March 2011}}</ref>  After the election, the [[Government of the 31st Dáil|Fine Gael–Labour coalition]]'s programme for government promised a [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] to draft a range of reforms, including "Removing blasphemy from the Constitution". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finegael.ie/upload/ProgrammeforGovernmentFinal.pdf#page=17|title=Programme for Government|date=March 2010|publisher=Fine Gael|accessdate=10 March 2011}}</ref> .
