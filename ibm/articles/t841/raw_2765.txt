The '''''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy''' began after 12 [[editorial cartoon]]s, most of which [[Depictions of Muhammad|depicted]] the [[Islamic]] [[prophet]] [[Muhammad]], were published in the Danish [[List of newspapers in Denmark|newspaper]] ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'' on 30 September 2005. The newspaper announced that this publication was an attempt to contribute to the debate regarding [[criticism of Islam]] and [[self-censorship]].  . 

[[Islam in Denmark|Danish Muslim]] organizations that objected to the depictions responded by holding public protests attempting to raise awareness of ''Jyllands-Posten''&#039;s publication. Further examples of the cartoons were soon [[List of newspapers that reprinted Jyllands-Posten's Muhammad cartoons|reprinted in newspapers]] in more than 50 other countries, further deepening the [[controversy]].  . 

Four months later, Muslims protested across the Islamic world, some of which escalated into violence with instances of firing on crowds of protestors resulting in a total of more than 100 reported deaths,<ref name="web.archive.org">{{cite news|date=2 March 2006| title=Cartoon Body Count|publisher=Web|url=http://www.cartoonbodycount.com/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060326071135/http://www.cartoonbodycount.com/|archivedate=26 March 2006}}</ref> including the [[2008 Danish embassy bombing in Islamabad|bombing of the Danish embassy in Pakistan]] and setting fire to the Danish Embassies in Syria, Lebanon and Iran, storming European buildings, and [[Flag desecration|burning]] the [[flag of Denmark|Danish]], [[flag of the Netherlands|Dutch]], [[flag of Norway|Norwegian]], [[flag of France|French]] and [[flag of Germany|German]] flags in [[Gaza City]]. <ref>{{cite web

Supporters have said that the cartoons illustrated an important issue in a period of [[Islamic terrorism]] and explained that their publication is a legitimate exercise of the right of [[freedom of speech|free speech]], explicitly tied to the issue of self-censorship. They explained that Muslims were not targeted in a [[discrimination|discriminatory]] way, since unflattering cartoons about other [[religion]]s (or their leaders) are frequently printed. <ref>{{cite news|date=9 February 2006|title=The limits to free speech – Cartoon wars |publisher=The Economist|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5494602}}</ref>.  . 

==Description of the drawings==. 
{{Main|Descriptions of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons}} . 

The 12 cartoons were drawn by 12 professional cartoonists in Denmark, most of whom regularly drew [[Editorial cartoon|political cartoons]] for Danish newspapers. Four of the cartoons have Danish texts. One deliberately evades the whole problem, depicting a school child in Denmark named Muhammad, not the prophet Muhammad. One of the cartoons is based on a special Danish cultural expression, and one includes a Danish politician.  .

===Debate about self-censorship (2004 to September 2005)===. 
{{Muhammad cartoons}}
On 17 September 2005, the Danish newspaper ''[[Politiken]]'' ran an article under the headline ''"Dyb angst for kritik af islam"''<ref name="dybangst">{{cite news|date=17 September 2005|title=Dyb angst for kritik af islam|publisher=Politiken|url=http://politiken.dk/boger/article123660.ece}} {{da icon}}</ref> ("Profound anxiety about criticism of Islam"). The article in Politiken was the basis of a Ritzau telegram from the day before written by journalist Troels Pedersen. The article by Ritzau discussed the difficulty encountered by the writer [[Kåre Bluitgen]], who was initially unable to find an [[illustrator]] prepared to work with Bluitgen on his children's book ''Koranen og profeten Muhammeds liv'' (English: ''The [[Qur'an]] and the life of the Prophet Muhammad'' ISBN 87-638-0049-7). Three artists declined Bluitgen's proposal before one agreed to assist anonymously. According to Bluitgen: . 

<blockquote>One [artist declined], with reference to the murder in Amsterdam of the film director [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]], while another [declined, citing the attack on] the lecturer at the [[Carsten Niebuhr|Carsten Niebuhr Institute]] in Copenhagen. <ref name="dybangst"/></blockquote> . 

In October 2004, a lecturer at the Niebuhr institute at the [[University of Copenhagen]] was assaulted by five assailants who opposed his reading of the Qur'an to non-Muslims during a lecture. <ref>{{cite news|date=9 October 2004|title=Overfaldet efter Koran-læsning|publisher=TV 2 (Denmark)|url=http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/article.php?id=1424089}} {{da icon}}</ref> . 

The refusal of the first three artists to participate was seen as evidence of [[self-censorship]] and led to much debate in Denmark, with other examples for similar reasons soon emerging. Comedian [[Frank Hvam]] declared that he would (hypothetically) dare to urinate on the Bible on television, but not on the Qur'an. <ref>{{cite news|title=Debat: Bangebuks versus Kulturminister, 3rd section, Bøger, p.7|publisher=Weekendavisen|date=7 October 2005|url=http://www.infomedia.dk}} {{da icon}}</ref><ref name="whyipub">{{cite news|date=19 February 2005|title=Why I Published Those Cartoons|publisher=WashingtonPost|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/17/AR2006021702499.html|first=Flemming|last=Rose|accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref> . 

===Publication of the cartoons (September 30, 2005)===. 
On 30 September 2005, the [[newspaper|daily newspaper]] ''Jyllands-Posten'' ("The [[Jutland]] Post") published an article entitled "Muhammeds ansigt"<ref name="muhammeds_ansigt">{{cite news|first=Flemming|last=Rose|date=30 September 2005|title=Muhammeds ansigt|publisher=Jyllands-Posten|url=http://www.jp.dk/login?url=indland/artikel:aid=3293102:fid=11146}}{{Dead link|date=March 2010}} {{da icon}}</ref> ("The face of Muhammad"). The article consisted of 12 cartoons (of which only some depicted Muhammad) and an explanatory text, in which [[Flemming Rose]], ''Jyllands-Posten''&#039;s culture editor, commented: . 

{{quotation|The modern, [[secularism|secular]] society is rejected by some Muslims. They demand a special position, insisting on special consideration of their own religious feelings. It is incompatible with contemporary democracy and freedom of speech, where one must be ready to put up with insults, mockery and ridicule. It is certainly not always attractive and nice to look at, and it does not mean that religious feelings should be made fun of at any price, but that is of minor importance in the present context. [...] we are on our way to a slippery slope where no-one can tell how the self-censorship will end. That is why Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten has invited members of the Danish editorial cartoonists union to draw Muhammad as they see him. [...]|<ref name="muhammeds_ansigt" />}} .

After the invitation from ''Jyllands-Posten'' to about forty different artists to give their interpretation of Muhammad, 12 [[caricaturist]]s chose to respond with a drawing each. Many also commented on the surrounding self-censorship debate. Three of these 12 cartoons were illustrated by Jyllands-Posten's own staff, including the "bomb in turban" and "[[niqāb]]s" cartoons.  . 

On 19 February, Rose explained his intent further In the ''Washington Post'': . 

{{quotation|The cartoonists treated Islam the same way they treat Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism and other religions. And by treating Muslims in Denmark as equals they made a point: We are integrating you into the Danish tradition of satire because you are part of our society, not strangers. The cartoons are including, rather than excluding, Muslims.|<ref name="whyipub" />}} . 

In October 2005, the Danish daily ''[[Politiken]]'' polled thirty-one of the forty-three members of the Danish cartoonist association. Twenty-three said they would be willing to draw Muhammad. One had doubts, one would not be willing because of fear of possible reprisals and six cartoonists would not be willing because they respected the Muslim ban on depicting Muhammad. <ref>"Profetens ansigt: Ingen selvcensur blandt tegnere". Politiken 20. oktober 2005, 2. sektion, side 3</ref> . 

===Danish Prime Minister's meeting refusal (October 2005)=== . 

Having received petitions from Danish imams, eleven ambassadors from Muslim-majority countries asked for a meeting with Danish Prime Minister [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] on 19 October 2005,<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article725158.ece Timeline: the Muhammad cartoons], Timesonline 6 Febr. 2006. Retrieved 10 January 2010. </ref> in order to discuss what they perceived as an "on-going smearing campaign in Danish public circles and media against Islam and Muslims". In a letter, the ambassadors mentioned not only the issue of the Muhammad cartoons, but also a recent indictment against [[Radio Holger]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Denmark targets extremist media |date=17 August 2005|url=

{{quotation|We deplore these statements and publications and urge Your Excellency’s government to take all those responsible to task under law of the land in the interest of inter-faith harmony, better integration and Denmark's overall relations with the Muslim world. <ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.filtrat.dk/grafik/Letterfromambassadors.pdf Official letter from the 12 ambassadors]|74.5&nbsp;KB}}</ref>}}
The government answered the ambassadors' request for a meeting with Rasmussen with a letter only: "The freedom of expression has a wide scope and the [[Politics of Denmark|Danish government]] has no means of influencing the press. However, Danish legislation prohibits acts or expressions of blasphemous or discriminatory nature. The offended party may bring such acts or expressions to court, and it is for the courts to decide in individual cases."<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://gfx-master.tv2.dk/images/Nyhederne/Pdf/side3.pdf Official response to ambassadors from A.F.Rasmussen]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}|545&nbsp;KB}}</ref> . 

The ambassadors maintained that they had never asked for ''Jyllands-Posten'' to be prosecuted; possibly, the non-technical phrase of the letter, "to take NN to task under law", meant something like "to hold NN responsible within the limits of the law". <ref>{{cite news|title=Ambassadør-breve blev forvekslet i Politiken|date=20 February 2006|url=http://politiken.dk/VisArtikel.iasp?PageID=439519| publisher=Politiken}}{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref> Rasmussen replied: "Even a non-judicial intervention against ''Jyllands-Posten'' would be impossible within our system". <ref>{{da icon}} {{cite news|title=»Oversættelsen er helt uvæsentlig«|date=21 February 2006|url=http://politiken.dk/VisArtikel.iasp?PageID=439706| publisher=Politiken}}{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref> . 

The Egyptian [[Foreign minister|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], Aboul Gheit, wrote several letters to the Prime Minister of Denmark and to the [[United Nations Secretary-General]] explaining that they did not want the Prime Minister to prosecute ''Jyllands-Posten''; they only wanted "an official Danish statement underlining the need for and the obligation of respecting all religions and desisting from offending their devotees to prevent an escalation which would have serious and far-reaching consequences". <ref>{{da icon}} {{cite news|title=Egypten gav Fogh mulighed for forsoning|date=22 February 2006|url=http://politiken.dk/VisArtikel.iasp?PageID=439859| publisher=Politiken}}{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref> Subsequently, the Egyptian government played a leading role in defusing the issue in the Middle East. <ref>{{da icon}} {{cite news|title=Egypten stod bag profetkampagne|date=17 February 2006|url=http://politiken.dk/VisArtikel.iasp?PageID=439149

The refusal to meet the ambassadors has been criticized by the Danish [[political opposition]], twenty-two Danish ex-ambassadors, and former Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[Uffe Ellemann-Jensen]]. <ref>{{da icon}} {{cite news|title=Danish ambassadors criticise Andersen Fogh Rasmussen|date=20 December 2005|url=http://politiken.dk/VisArtikel.sasp?PageID=425730| publisher=Politiken}}{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref> . 

===Judicial investigation of ''Jyllands-Posten'' (October 2005 - January 2006)===. 
On 27 October 2005, a number of Muslim organizations filed a complaint with the Danish police claiming that ''Jyllands-Posten'' had committed an offence under section 140 and 266b of the [[Danish Criminal Code]]. <ref name="danish_response_to_un_jan">{{cite news|title=Official Response by the Danish Government to the UN Special Rapporteurs|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark|date=24 January 2006|url=http://www.um.dk/NR/rdonlyres/00D9E6F7-32DC-4C5A-8E24-F0C96E813C06/0/060123final.pdf |format=PDF}} {{da icon}}</ref>
* Section 140<ref name="par140">{{cite news|title=§140 of the Danish criminal code|publisher=Juraportalen Themis|url=http://www.themis.dk/synopsis/docs/Lovsamling/Straffeloven_kap_15.html}} {{da icon}}</ref> of the [[Criminal Code]], known as the blasphemy law, prohibits disturbing [[public order]] by publicly ridiculing or insulting the dogmas of worship of any lawfully existing religious community in Denmark. Only one case has ever resulted in a sentence, a 1938 case involving an [[Anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] group. The most recent case was in 1971 when a [[program director]] of [[Danmarks Radio]] was charged, but found not guilty. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Politik/2006/02/16/130153.htm|title=Den glemte paragraf|publisher=dr.dk|date=16 February 2006}} {{da icon}}</ref>

On 6 January 2006, the Regional [[Prosecutor|Public Prosecutor]] in [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]] discontinued the investigation as he found no basis for concluding that the cartoons constituted a [[crime|criminal offence]]. His reason is based on his finding that the article concerns a subject of [[public interest]] and, further, on Danish [[case law]] which extends editorial freedom to journalists when it comes to a subject of public interest. He stated that, in assessing what constitutes an offence, the right to freedom of speech must be taken into consideration. He stated that the right to freedom of speech must be exercised with the necessary respect for other [[human rights]], including the right to protection against discrimination, insult and degradation, but no apparent violation of the law had occurred. <ref name="danish_response_to_un_jan"/> In a new hearing, the Director of Public Prosecutors in Denmark agreed. <ref name="rigsadvokaten PR">{{cite news|title=Decision on possible criminal proceedings|publisher=Rigsadvokaten|date=15 March 2006|url=http://www.rigsadvokaten.dk/ref.aspx?id=890 |format=PDF}}</ref> . 

===Danish Imams tour the Middle East, publicising the issue (December 2005)=== . 

Two [[imam]]s who had been granted sanctuary in Denmark, dissatisfied with the reaction of the Danish Government and ''Jyllands-Posten'', created a dossier containing a forty-three-page document entitled "''Dossier about championing the prophet Muhammad peace be upon him''."<ref name="pdfdossier">{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}{{cite news|title=Photocopy of the Imam's dossier|publisher=Politiken|url=http://politiken.dk/media/pdf/5679.PDF|format=PDF}}{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref> This consisted of several letters from Muslim organisations explaining their case including allegations of the mistreatment of Danish Muslims, citing the ''Jyllands-Posten'' cartoons (including the false claim that said publication was a government-run newspaper) and further containing the following causes of "pain and torment" for the authors:
#Pictures from another Danish newspaper, ''[[Weekendavisen]]'', which they called "even more offending" (than the original 12 cartoons);
#Hate-mail pictures and letters that the dossier's authors alleged were sent to Muslims in Denmark, said to be indicative of the rejection of Muslims by the Danish;
#A televised interview discussing Islam with [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Member of Parliament|member of parliament]] and Islam critic [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali|Hirsi Ali]], who had received the Freedom Prize "for her work to further freedom of speech and the rights of women" from the [[Danish Liberal Party]] represented by Anders Fogh Rasmussen.  . 

Appended to the dossier were multiple clippings from ''Jyllands-Posten'', multiple clippings from ''Weekendavisen'', some clippings from Arabic-language papers and three additional images which also had no connection with Denmark. [[File:Pig person.jpg|thumb|right|This picture of a [[La Pourcailhade|French pig-squealing contest]]ant was unrelated to the Muhammed drawings, but was included in the imams' dossier. Original caption included in the dossier: ''"Her er det rigtige billede af Muhammed"'', meaning "Here is the real image of Muhammad."<ref>[http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Indland/2006/02/07/234208.htm dr.dk – "Billede fra grisefestival i imamers mappe" – in Danish]. </ref>]] .

Retrieved 31 January 2009. </ref> One of the other two additional images (a photo) portrayed a Muslim being mounted by a dog while praying, and the other (a cartoon) portrayed Muhammad as a demonic paedophile. Equipped with the dossier, the two imams circulated it throughout the Muslim world, presenting their case to many influential religious and [[politician|political leaders]], asking for support. <ref>[http://service.spiegel.de/cache/international/0,1518,398624,00.html Alienated Danish Muslims Sought Help from Arabs]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref> . 

The dossier<ref name="pdfdossier" /> contained such statements as the following:
* We urge you [recipient of the letter or dossier] to — on the behalf of thousands of believing Muslims — to give us the opportunity of having a constructive contact with the press and particularly with the relevant decision makers, not briefly, but with a scientific methodology and a planned and long-term programme seeking to make views approach each other and remove misunderstandings between the two parties involved. Since we do not wish for Muslims to be accused of being backward and narrow, likewise we do not wish for Danes to be accused of ideological arrogance either. When this relationship is back on its track, the result will bring satisfaction, an underpinning of security and the stable relations, and a flourishing Denmark for all that live here. 
* The faithful in their religion (Muslims) suffer under a number of circumstances, first and foremost the lack of official recognition of the Islamic faith. This has led to a lot of problems, especially the lack of right to build mosques [...]
* Even though they [the Danes] belong to the [[Christianity|Christian faith]], the secularizations have overcome them, and if you say that they are all infidels, then you are not wrong. 
* We [Muslims] do not need lessons in democracy, but it is actually us, who through our deeds and speeches educate the whole world in democracy. 
* This [Europe's] dictatorial way of using democracy is completely unacceptable. 
The inclusion in the dossier of the cartoons from ''Weekendavisen'' was possibly a misunderstanding, as these were more likely intended as parodies of the pompousness of ''Jyllands-Posten'''s cartoons than as comments on Muhammad in their own right. <ref>[http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Indland/2006/01/04/161736.htm Trossamfund angriber Muhammed-satire i Weekendavisen] {{da icon}}</ref> They consist of reproductions of works such as the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' (caption: ''For centuries, a previously unknown society has known that this is a painting of the Prophet, and guarded this secret.

He has since then been forced to go underground, fearing for the wrath of a crazy albino imam''). This is a parody of the [[Da Vinci Code]].  . 

At a 6 December 2005 summit of the [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC), with many [[Head of State|heads of state]] in attendance, the dossier was handed around on the sidelines first,<ref name="news.independent.co.uk">{{cite news|title= How a meeting of leaders in Mecca set off the cartoon wars around the world|publisher=The Independent|date=10 February 2006|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article344482.ece|location=London|first1=Daniel|last1=Howden|first2=David|last2=Hardaker|first3=Stephen|last3=Castle|accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref> and eventually an official communiqué was issued, demanding that the [[United Nations]] impose [[international sanctions]] upon Denmark. <ref name="UN resolution">{{cite news|date=29 January 2006|title=Muslims seek UN resolution over Danish prophet cartoons|publisher=IslamOnLine|url=http://www.islam-online.net/English/News/2006-01/30/article01.shtml}}</ref> .

In response to protests from Muslim groups, ''Jyllands-Posten'' published two open letters on its website, each of them in a Danish and an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] version, defending the right of the newspaper to publish the drawings but at the same time apologising for any offense the drawings may have caused. <ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www1.jp.dk/indland/doku/jp_aabent_brev.pdf Jyllands-Posten's letter in Arabic]|18.2&nbsp;KB}} {{ar icon}}</ref> The second letter, dated 30 January 2006, had a Danish version,<ref>[http://www.nordvux.net/page/305/kronologiovermuhammedaff%C3%A6ren.htm Ærede medborgere i den muslimske verden:], Danish text from Jyllands-Posten of 30 January 2006, 21:31.

{{See|List of newspapers that reprinted Jyllands-Posten's Muhammad cartoons}}
In 2005, the Muhammad cartoons controversy received only minor media attention outside of Denmark. Six of the cartoons were first reprinted by the Egyptian newspaper ''[[El Fagr]]'' on 17 October 2005,<ref>{{cite news|date=10 February 2005|title=Danes Blame Imams for Satire Escalation, Survey Says (Update1)|publisher=Bloomberg|url= http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000085&sid=a8hEmi2ja5cg&refer=europe}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=8 February 2006|title=No Danish Treatment for an Egyptian Newspaper|publisher=FreedomForEgyptians|url= http://freedomforegyptians.blogspot.com/2006/02/egyptian-newspaper-pictures-that.html}}</ref> along with an article strongly denouncing them, but publication did not provoke any condemnations or other reactions from religious or government authorities. Between October 2005 and the end of January 2006, examples of the cartoons were reprinted in major European newspapers from the Netherlands, Germany, Scandinavia, Belgium and France. Very soon after, as protests grew, there were further re-publications around the globe, but primarily in [[continental Europe]].  . 

Notable for a lack of republication of the cartoons were most major newspapers in Canada,<ref name="National Post">{{cite web|last=Post |first=National |url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/story.html?id=bd2a1182-255c-4cb4-a7ef-f725bb5a9d41 |title=Editors weigh free press, respect for religious views |publisher=Canada.com |date=4 February 2006 |accessdate=22 March 2010}}</ref> the USA<ref>{{cite news|date=4 February 2006|title=A media dilemma: The rest of a story|publisher=Philadelphia Inquirer|url=http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/front/13788640.htm}}{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref> and the United Kingdom,<ref>{{cite news|date=6 February 2006|title=US, British media tread carefully in cartoon furor|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0206/dailyUpdate.html}}{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref> where editorials covered the story without including them.

===Apology by Danish newspaper (2010)===. 
Following a meeting between the editor-in-chief of the Danish newspaper [[Politiken]] [[Tøger Seidenfaden]] and Faisal A.Z. Yamani, Saudi attorney-at-law, who represented eight Muslim groups from the Middle East and Australia, the Danish newspaper apologized for having reprinted a cartoon by Kurt Westergaard in 2008, and issued a press release saying:<ref name="Politiken retraction">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/27/world/europe/27briefs-Cartoon.html?ref=world|title=Denmark: Cartoon Apology|coauthors=The Associated Press|date=26 February 2010|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=27 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/debat/fakta/article910939.ece |title='&#39;Politiken'&#39;, Statement published by Politiken |language={{da icon}} |publisher=Politiken.dk |accessdate=22 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/debat/fakta/article910932.ece |title='&#39;Politiken'&#39;, Joint press release |language={{da icon}} |publisher=Politiken.dk |accessdate=22 March 2010}}</ref>{{quotation|Politiken has never intended to reprint the Cartoon Drawing as a statement of editorial opinion or values but merely as part of the newspaper's news coverage (...)

The apology has prompted criticism from leading Danish politicians, among them prime minister [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]], who stated that "Politiken is bowing to other's views of our freedom of speech and this can lead to further attacks on Danish freedom of speech," as well as the head of the Danish Union of Journalists, but Politiken has replied that the settlement did not mean that it had imposed on itself a ban on future publications of the drawings. <ref>{{cite web|last=Simonsson |first=Lennart |url=http://arabnews.com/middleeast/article23085.ece |title=Arabnews.com, "Danish paper criticized over cartoon settlement", 26 February 2010 |publisher=Arabnews.com |accessdate=22 March 2010}}</ref> .

{{wikinews|New agitations over cartoons of Prophet Mohammed}}
One year after the publication of the original cartoons, a video surfaced showing members of the [[Danish People's Party|Danish People's Party's]] youth wing engaged in a contest of drawing pictures that insult Muhammad. Publicity surrounding the contest led to renewed tension between the Islamic world and Denmark,<ref>{{cite news|title= Anti-Muslim video sparks new outrage against Denmark|org=The Independent|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article1826296.ece|location=London|first=Stephen|last=Castle|date=10 October 2006|accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref> with the OIC and many countries weighing in. The Danish government condemned the youths, and those who were depicted in the video went into hiding after receiving death threats.  . 

Two weeks into this episode, a Danish [[artist]]s' group, "Defending Denmark", claimed responsibility for the video and said it had [[Espionage|infiltrated]] the Danish People's Party Youth for 18 months claiming "to document (their) [[Far right|extreme right]] wing associations". <ref>{{cite news|title=Web sites remove videos mocking Muhammad|org=AP|url= http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061010/ap_on_re_eu/denmark_prophet_drawings}}{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref> . 

A few days later, a new episode surfaced when a member of the [[Radikal Ungdom|Social-liberal youth movement]] stated that members of the movement had also drawn pictures of Muhammad during a weekend meeting. Unlike the Danish People's Party Youth's drawings, this episode was not condoned by the youth movement, but was done by individuals. <ref name="Stampe">{{cite news|url=http://politiken.dk/debat/kroniker/article188414.ece|title=Et døgn med Muhammed |last=Stampe|first=Zenia|date=20 October 2006|publisher=[[Politiken]]|language=Danish|accessdate=8 November 2008}}</ref> .

===January 2010 Westergaard incident===. 
On 1 January 2010, Danish police shot and wounded a man at the home of Kurt Westergaard in [[Aarhus]]. Westergaard drew the best known of the cartoons, which depicted the prophet Muhammad with a bomb in his turban. The man was described as a 28-year-old [[Somalia|Somali]] linked to the Islamist [[Harakat al-Shabaab Mujahideen|al-Shabab militia]]. He reportedly shouted in broken English that he wanted to kill Westergaard, who alerted police after locking himself into a [[safe room|panic room]] in the house, which was a specially fortified bathroom. <ref name="bbc shooting">{{cite news

====Self-censorship of Norwegian newspaper====. 
The regional newspaper ''[[Adresseavisen]]'' destroyed an edition of its [[Supplement (publishing)|weekend supplement]] in early October 2010 before it was distributed.

Blix declined to give details of the drawing or the reason for its unacceptability, however according to Henriksen the depiction was of Kurt Westergaard holding one of his Mohammad drawings. <ref>{{Cite news |author= Øgrim, Helge |title= – Ikke av frykt for sikkerhet |url= http://www.journalisten.no/story/62650 |work= [[Journalisten]] |language= Norwegian |date= October 5, 2010 |accessdate= October 5, 2010 |authorlink= Helge Øgrim}}</ref> .

===Danish journalistic tradition===. 
[[Freedom of speech]] was guaranteed in law by the Danish Constitution in 1849, as it is today by The Constitutional Act of Denmark of 5 June 1953. <ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.folketinget.dk/pdf/constitution.pdf The Danish constitution]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}|120&nbsp;KB}}</ref> It is defended vigorously, although it was suspended during the German [[occupation of Denmark]] in World War II. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.besaettelse-befrielse.dk/leksikon_d.html|title=Dagbladene under besættelsen (The newspapers during the occupation)|publisher=Historisk Samling fra Besættelsestiden 1940–1945|accessdate=2 August 2008|author=Helle Sejersen}}</ref> Freedom of expression is also protected by the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].  . 

The [[List of newspapers in Denmark|Danish newspapers]] are privately owned and independent from the government, and Danish freedom of expression is quite far-reaching, even by Western European standards. In the past, this has provoked official protests from Germany for Denmark allowing the printing of [[Neo-Nazism|neo-nazi]] propaganda, and from Russia for "solidarity with terrorists" following the World Chechen Congress held in Denmark in 1999. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2369083.stm| title=Chechen rebels seek talks with Moscow|publisher=BBC News|date=28 October 2002}}</ref> The organization [[Reporters Without Borders]] ranked Denmark at the top of its Worldwide Press Freedom Index for 2005. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=554|publisher=Reporters Without Borders|title=World Press Freedom Index, 2005}}{{dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref> .

===Muslim tradition===. 
====Aniconism====. 
{{Main|Aniconism in Islam|Depictions of Muhammad}} . 

Owing to the traditions of [[aniconism]] in Islam, the majority of [[art]] concerning Muhammad is [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphic]] in nature. The Qur'an condemns [[idolatry]], and pictoral forms are seen as ostensibly close to idol worship. These are found in ahadith (plural of [[hadith]]): ''"[[Abd-Allah ibn Umar|Ibn ‘Umar]] reported Allah’s Messenger having said: Those who paint pictures would be punished on the Day of [[Resurrection]] and it would be said to them: Breathe [[soul]] into what you have created."''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/muslim/024.smt.html#024.5268 |title=Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 24 |publisher=Usc.edu |accessdate=!

Within Muslim communities, views have varied regarding pictorial representations. [[Shi'a Islam]] has been generally tolerant of pictorial representations of human figures, including Muhammad. <ref>[http://www.sistani.org/html/eng/menu/4/?lang=eng&view=d&code=234&page=1 Answers of Grand Ayatollah Uzma Sistani]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref> Contemporary [[Sunni Islam]] generally forbids any pictorial representation of Muhammad,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cair-net.org/default.asp?Page=articleView&id=38845&theType=NB |title=CAIR press release |publisher=Cair-net.org |accessdate=22 March 2010}}</ref> but has had periods allowing depictions of Muhammad's face covered with a veil or as a featureless void emanating light.  The [[Islamic Circle of North America]] (ICNA) has condemned the depiction of any prophet, from Adam to Moses to Jesus to Mohammed. <ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FxZ2oS7tNX0C&pg=PA101&dq=%22Islamic+Circle+of+North+America%22&lr=lang_en&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&ei=0VlmS-iIAYnEywS5wMDNCg&cd=121#v=onepage&q=%22Islamic%20Circle%20of%20North%20America%22&f=false |title='&#39;The Cartoons Cry'&#39;, Muhammad Tariq Ghazi, AuthorHouse, 2006, ISBN 1-4259-4764-6, accessed 31 January 2010 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=22 March 2010}}</ref>
A few contemporary interpretations of Islam, such as some adherents of [[Wahhabism]] and [[Salafism]], are entirely [[aniconism|aniconistic]] and condemn pictorial representations of any kind. 
The [[Taliban]], while in power in [[Afghanistan]], banned television, photographs and images in newspapers and destroyed paintings including [[fresco]]es in the vicinity of the [[Buddhas of Bamyan]] (which they also destroyed). <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/recent/sept_11/afghan_culture_03.shtml |title=Afghanistan: At the Crossroads of Ancient Civilisations |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=1 September 2002 |accessdate=22 March 2010}}</ref>

====Prohibition against insulting Muhammad====. 
In Muslim societies, insulting Muhammad is considered one of the gravest of all crimes. Some interpretations of the [[Shariah]], in particular the relatively fringe [[Salafi]] (Wahabi) group, state that any insult to Muhammad warrants death. <ref>{{cite news|title=Question #22809: Ruling on one who insults the Prophet |publisher=Islam Q & A |url=http://www.islam-qa.com/index.php?ln=eng&ds=qa&lv=browse&QR=22809&dgn=4}}</ref> . 

However, the Organization of the Islamic Conference has denounced calls for the death of the Danish cartoonists. OIC's Secretary General [[Ekmeleddin İhsanoğlu|Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu]] stated in a press release:
<blockquote>
''The Secretary General appeals to the Muslims to stay calm and peaceful in the wake of sacrilegious depiction of Prophet Muhammad which has deeply hurt their feelings. He has stated that Islam being the religion of tolerance, mercy and peace teaches them to defend their faith through democratic and legal means.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oic-oci.org/press/english/2006/January%202006/denemark-3.htm|title=Statement by H.E. Prof Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu Secretary General of the OIC|date=28 January 2006|author=Organization of the Islamic Conference}}{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref>
</blockquote> . 

===Associating Islam with terrorism===. 
Many Muslims have explained their anti-cartoon stance as against ''insulting'' pictures and not so much as against pictures in ''general''. According to the [[BBC]]: . 

{{quotation|It is the satirical intent of the cartoonists and the association of the Prophet with terrorism, that is so offensive to the vast majority of Muslims.|<ref>{{cite news|first=Magdi|last=Abdelhadi|title=Cartoon row highlights deep divisions|date=4 February 2006|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4678220.stm}}</ref>}} . 

{{quotation|Why is the insult so deeply felt by some Muslims? Of course, there is the prohibition on images of Muhammad. But one cartoon, showing the Prophet wearing a turban shaped as a bomb with a burning fuse, extends the caricature of Muslims as terrorists to Muhammad. In this image, Muslims see a depiction of Islam, its prophet and Muslims in general as terrorists. This will certainly play into a widespread perception among Muslims across the world that many in the West harbour a hostility towards – or fear of – Islam and Muslims.|<ref>{{cite news|title=Q&A: Depicting the Prophet Muhammad|date=2 February 2006|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4674864.stm}}</ref>}} . 

===Islamism and accusations of xenophobia===.

===Allegations of "agendas"===. 
====Agenda in the West====. 
Some commentators see the publications of the cartoons and the riots that took place in response, as part of a coordinated effort to show Muslims and Islam in a bad light, thus influencing public opinion in the West in aid of various political projects, for example to support further military intervention in the Middle East. <ref>{{cite news|date=23 March 2006|title=Islam and globanalisation|publisher=Al-Ahram|url=http://www.irna.ir/en/news/view/line-22/0601317044194736.htm}}{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=23 March 2006|title=Rotten in Denmark |publisher=antiwar|url=http://antiwar.com/justin/?articleid=8512}}</ref> . 

The controversy was used to highlight a supposedly irreconcilable rift between Europeans and Islam – as the journalist Andrew Mueller put it: "I am concerned that the ridiculous, disproportionate reaction to some unfunny sketches in an obscure Scandinavian newspaper may confirm that ... Islam and the West are fundamentally irreconcilable"<ref>Cited in The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins (2006) – p26</ref> – and many demonstrations in the Middle-East were encouraged by the regimes there for their own purposes. Different groups used this tactic for different purposes, some more explicitly than others: for example [[Nativism (politics)|anti-immigrant]] groups, nationalists, feminists, [[classical liberalism|classical liberals]] and national governments. <ref>{{cite news|date=May/June 2006|title=‘The journalists of Jyllands-Posten are a bunch of reactionary provocateurs’ The Danish cartoon controversy and the self-image of Europe |publisher=Radical Phillosophy|author= Heiko Henkel|url=http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/default.asp?channel_id=2187&editorial_id=21398}}</ref> . 

Muslim critics have also accused the West, in particular the EU, of double standards in adopting laws that outlaw [[Holocaust denial]]. Denmark, along with Britain and Sweden, have particularly libertarian traditions concerning Holocaust denial and pressed for wording in a recent EU legislation that would avoid criminalizing debates about the Holocaust and would ensure that films and plays about the Holocaust would not be censored. <ref>{{cite news|date=19 April 2007|title=EU adopts measure outlawing Holocaust denial |publisher=International Herald Tribune|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/04/19/news/eu.php}}</ref> . 

====Alleged Zionist agenda====. 
Among others,<ref>{{cite news|date=2 March 2006|title=Qatari University Lecturer Ali Muhi Al-din Al-Qardaghi: Muhammad Cartoon Is a Jewish Attempt to Divert European Hatred from Jews to Muslims|publisher=Al-Jazeera/MemriTV|url=http://www.memritv.org/Transcript.asp?P1=1030}}{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref> [[Iran]]'s supreme leader Ayatollah [[Ali Khamenei]] blamed a "Zionist [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]]" for the row over the cartoons. <ref>{{cite news|date=7 February 2006|title=Cartoons 'part of Zionist plot'|publisher=Guardian|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/cartoonprotests/story/0,,1704174,00.html|location=London|accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref> [[Palestinian Christian]] diplomat [[Afif Safieh]], then the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]]'s envoy to Washington, alleged the [[Likud]] party concocted the distribution of Muhammad caricatures worldwide in a bid to create a clash between the West and the Muslim world. <ref>{{cite news|date=13 February 2006|title=PA: Likud behind Muhammad cartoons|publisher=ynet|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3215284,00.html}}</ref> .

===Alleged political correctness===. 
Critics of [[political correctness]] see the cartoon controversy as a sign that attempts at judicial codification of such concepts as [[respect]], [[Toleration|tolerance]] and [[offense (etiquette)|offense]] have backfired on their advocates, "leaving them without a leg to stand on"<ref>{{cite news|date=13 February 2006|title=Respectful Cultures & Disrespectful Cartoons|publisher=Counterpunch News|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/neumann02132006.html}}</ref> and in retreat again: . 

{{quotation|The issue will almost certainly lead to a revisiting of the lamentable laws against "hate speech" in Europe, and with any luck to a debate on whether these laws are more likely to destroy public harmony than encourage it.
