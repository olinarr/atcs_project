The '''International reaction to ''[[Fitna (film)|Fitna]]''''' consisted of condemnation within the [[international community]], several [[Fatwā|fatawā]] against [[Geert Wilders]], and attempts by many [[Islamism|Islamic]] countries to [[Censorship|censor]] the film. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government immediately distanced itself from the film. Several [[Muslim]] [[Non-governmental organization|organizations]] and [[political party|political parties]] have organized [[boycott]]s against [[Netherlands|Dutch]] products.  . 

==Prior to the release==. 
It was feared that the film would lead to violent demonstrations by [[Muslims]] much like the organized protests against the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons]] that were published in the [[Denmark|Danish]] newspaper ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'' in 2005. <ref name="embassyburning">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4681294.stm|title=Embassies burn in cartoon protest|date=2006-02-04|accessdate=2008-03-08|publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref> The Dutch counter-terrorism agency raised its terror risk level from "limited" to "substantial", fearing [[Civil disorder|civil unrest]] and [[International sanctions|economic sanctions]]. <ref name="dtl">{{cite news|title=Dutch raise threat level ahead of anti-Koran film|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-32339620080306|date=2008-03-06|accessdate=2008-04-02|first=Emma|last=Thomasson|work=[[Reuters]]}}</ref>

===In the Netherlands===. 
The movie was first mentioned in the Dutch media on November 27, 2007. The Dutch government almost immediately expressed great concern about the film release. <ref name="First mention of the movie">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/2634487/Provocerende_film_Wilders.html?p=26,1|language=Dutch|title=Provocerende film Wilders|work=[[De Telegraaf]]|first=Paul|last=Jansen|date=2007-11-27|accessdate=2008-03-22}}</ref> It made [[emergency evacuation|evacuation]] plans available to all its consulates and embassies worldwide, in case an [[emergency]] should arise in light of the forthcoming film, and it tightened [[security]] [[measurements]] around certain [[military]] installations abroad. <ref name="filmworry">{{cite web|url=http://www.nowpublic.com/politics/wilders-and-his-film-worry-dutch-expats|title=Wilders and his film worry Dutch expats|first=Perro|last=de Jong|date=2008-01-23|accessdate=2008-03-08|work=[[NowPublic]]}}</ref> . 

The [[Prime minister]] of the [[Netherlands]], [[Jan Peter Balkenende]], worried about possible repercussions for Dutch citizens and economic interests. <ref name="balkenende">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/mar/03/netherlands.islam|title=Dutch government could ban anti-Islam film|first=Mark|last=Tran|date=2008-03-03|accessdate=2008-03-08|work=[[The Guardian]] | location=London}}</ref> In response Wilders accused Balkenende of [[Capitulation (surrender)|capitulating]] to Islam. <ref name="balkenende2">{{cite web|url=http://www.elsevier.nl/nieuws/laatste_24_uur/artikel/asp/artnr/194215/|language=Dutch|title=Wilders: Premier is beroepslafaard|date=2008-02-23|accessdate=2008-03-08|work=elsevier.nl}}</ref> .

In one [[opinion poll]], 54% of Dutch people still believed that the film should be released, despite any possible negative effects. <ref name="poll">{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL0522616520080305|title=Dutch want Koran film shown but fear reactions: poll|accessdate=2008-03-31|publisher=Reuters|date=2008-03-05 | first=Emma | last=Thomasson}}</ref> . 

The publication of the film was investigated by the [[Ministry of Justice (Netherlands)|Dutch Ministry of Justice]] to find out whether the release of the film could be prevented, but this could not be done. <ref name="dmjreview">{{cite web|url=http://www.danielpipes.org/blog/815|title=Will [[Geert Wilders]] Show His Film on the Koran?|date=2007-12-29|accessdate=2008-03-08|first=Daniel|last=Pipes}}</ref> . 

On March 6, 2008, the Dutch government raised its national [[terrorist]]ic threat level from the status 'limited [[terrorist]]ic threat' to 'substantial terroristic threat' because it fears Muslim terrorists will launch attacks against European targets, citing the film as justification. <ref name="terror">{{cite web|url=http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/960/Buitenland/article/detail/196174/2008/03/06/Nederland-vreest-aanslagen-wegens-film-Wilders.dhtml|title=Nederland vreest aanslagen wegens film Wilders|language=Dutch|date=2008-03-06|accessdate=2008-03-08|work=hln.be}}</ref><ref name="terror2">{{cite news|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3175532,00.html|title=Dutch Raise Terror Threat Level After Film Stokes Muslim Hostility|date=2008-03-07|accessdate=2008-03-09|work=dw-world.de}}</ref> .

Television producer [[Harry de Winter]] had a large advertisement placed on the front page of ''[[de Volkskrant]]'' stating that if Wilders had said the things he has said about Muslims, about Jews, he would have been prosecuted for antisemitism. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nrc.nl/binnenland/article976448.ece/Advertentie_tegen_Wilders_op_voorpagina_Volkskrant|title=Advertentie tegen Wilders op voorpagina Volkskrant|language=Dutch|work=[[NRC Handelsblad]]|date=2008-03-17|accessdate=2008-03-28}}</ref> The advertisement was endorsed by the Jewish organisations ''[[Stichting de Initiavieven]]'' and ''[[Een Ander Joods Geluid]]''.  . 

===Other reactions===. 
On 7 April 2008, [[Indonesia]] blocked access to [[YouTube]] and a couple of other websites such as MySpace and Multiply. Minister of Menkon Info Muhammad Nuh has passed a bill that forces 146 ISP's in Indonesia to block access to YouTube on Monday. [[Kompas]] has confirmed that the reason for the block is [[YouTube|YouTube's]] refusal to remove ''Fitna'' from their servers. <ref name="Indonesia Blocks YouTube">{{Cite web|url=http://www.kompas.co.id/tekno/read.php?cnt=.xml.2008.04.07.10341640&channel=7&mn=114&idx=114|title=Indonesia Blokir YouTube|accessdate=2008-04-07|publisher=[[Kompas]], Indonesia|date=2008-04-07|language=Indonesian}}</ref> The block has now been removed, and the foreign relation minster has apologised to the people for any inconvenience.  .

Amongst other things, it stated:<blockquote>
"The film equates Islam with violence. We reject this interpretation. The vast majority of Muslims reject extremism and violence. In fact, the victims are often also Muslims... ...We therefore regret that Mr Wilders has released this film. We believe it serves no purpose other than to cause offence."<ref name="genaff"/></blockquote>
Dutch parliamentarians of the largest political parties, [[Pieter van Geel]] ([[Christian Democratic Appeal|CDA]]), Mariëtte Hamer ([[Labour Party (Netherlands)|PvdA]]) and [[Mark Rutte]] ([[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|VVD]]) stated that it is sad that the film does not present any solutions to current problems in the Dutch society - integration of Muslim immigrants and Muslim extremism - and invited Mr. Wilders to discuss possible solutions in the parliament. <ref name="nova27">{{cite news|url=http://novatv.nl/index.cfm?ln=nl&fuseaction=videoaudio.details&reportage_id=5923&CFID=39188582&CFTOKEN=29478978|title=Fitna is released, how does the Netherlands and the world react?|language=Dutch|work=[[Nova (Dutch TV series)|Nova]]|publisher=[[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]] [[VARA (broadcaster)|Vara]]|date=2008-03-27|accessdate=2008-03-27}}</ref> In a later parliamentary debate to discuss Balkenende's televised reaction, they expressed further opinions, calling the film 'cunningly made with evil intentions' (CDA), 'a message of fear beyond compare' (PvDA) and 'paranoid' (SP).

According to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', a speaker for the Muslim organization ''Contactorgaan Moslims en Overheid'' (CMO), Yusuf Altuntas, said that Wilders "is obviously looking to push the limits, but he resists crossing them."

In an [[editorial]] for the independent English-language Bangladeshi newspaper [[The Weekly Blitz]], under the editorship of [[Salah Choudhury]], there were many [[opinion]]s expressed in condemnation of the Muslim world's response: "The Muslim world that is vocal and vociferous in its demands for censorship in the West is going through a reenergized paroxysm of anger and hate," the newspaper said, and asked "is it realistic to mandate that 100% of the world’s population must be pro-Koran and pro-Muslim?" The editorial stated that ''Fitna's'' relative artistic or philosophical worth is irrelevant, and that its release is an issue of [[individual rights]], [[freedom of speech]], [[critical thinking]], and the West's [[culture|cultural]] inheratance of 3,000 years of [[civilization]]. The editorial continued to question Muslim countries' [[censorship]] and restriction of free speech, [[satire|satirically]] saying that "we should ask them firmly yet politely exactly how they so effectively censor the existing hate speech, the rampant anti-Semitic and anti-West propaganda that fill their media, Mosques, schools and universities on an hourly basis, every day, almost without exclusion."

The Supreme Council called for "peaceful protests that reflect the civilized aspect of Islam," and recommended [[dialogue]] with the [[Western world|West]] to "spread the true tenets of Islam and shed light on the life and precepts of prophet Mohammed."

Khatami concluded that "we see the hand of the Zionist regime behind these satanic acts and we cry 'death to Israel'."

Lengthier responses were released by the [[Arab European League]] and the Union of NGOs of the Islamic World.  . 

====Union of NGOs of the Islamic World====. 
The [[Union of NGOs of the Islamic World]] (UNIW) issued a press release, stating that the film "heavily included insults to the Holy Qur’an and to the Islamic values." The UNIW said that distribution of such [[Islamophobia|Islamophobic]] material, as well as other forms of Islamophobia such as the [[Play (theatre)|theatrical]] interpretation of Salman Rushdie's [[novel]], ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'', and the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons, should be banned in Europe. It said that "humiliation of the values that are held in high esteem by people cannot be justified by the freedom of speech" or [[art|artistic expression]]. It stated that "freedom of speech and disseminating ideas do not amount to the right to insult," and that no-one's "sacred values" should be humiliated. It went on to call for European states to "not give permission to such publications, broadcasts and policies," and asked that they "take the necessary regulations that shall regard the Islamophobic acts and incidents as a crime." The UNIW likened Islamophobia to antisemitism and its legal status in Europe, saying that if Islamophobia and Islamophobic publications are not made illegal, "marginal extremist-racist groups that are after discrimination may be strengthened." It said that Islamophobia is an  infringement of [[human rights]], and "a perilous discrimination." It said: <blockquote>"The reason why Muslim public opinion have not overreacted to these aforementioned broadcasts, policies and events is that they have a common sense stemming from their belief. Nevertheless, it does not mean that they shall never react. It should be ensured that Muslim public opinion react to these all the Anti-Islamist broadcasts, policies and acts through peaceful means."</blockquote>
The UNIW called on Europe "to use their common sense and heed, and to revise their attitudes in order to build social peace."

====Arab European League====. 
The [[Arab European League]] released a short film, ''Al Mouftinoun'', in response to ''Fitna''. It was released March 28 on [[YouTube]], one day after ''Fitna'' was released. ''Al Mouftinoun'' criticizes Fitna's director Wilders as a [[racism|racist]].

On [http://www.ael.nl/ their website], the AEL claimed the following:
<blockquote>
The announced movie of Wilders and the Danish cartoons are part of an agenda to provoke Muslims in Europe and around the world under the flag of freedom of expression. There can be no doubt about their intentions. Defending their statements with the right of expression is deceptive. There should be a debate on the content. 
The right-wing movement should not be underestimated. They represent a large part of European society. They are advocating for the eradication of equality as a constitutional law. And more often advocating for constriction of the rights of ethnic minorities. The right-wing movement in the Netherlands and in Europe in general is not compatible with its own "Western  values."<ref>AEL Blog about Fitna</ref>
</blockquote> . 

===Alternative Perspectives=== . 

A new offering by Sufi Films<ref>[http://www.sufifilms.com/savagesandterrorists]</ref> entitled Savage and Terrorists hopes to provide a balanced perspective on similar issues of concern through a comparative analysis between predominately Muslim tribes and the Native American plight in which the label "savages" was an attempt to make Indians appear subhuman in order to more easily exploit an entire nations resources. While incidents of savagery did in fact occur on both sides, the exploitation of those Indian incidents did not constitute the norms of the larger peaceful community. A deliberate promotion of hate and fear was the intent in order to facilitate control and increase profits.  .
