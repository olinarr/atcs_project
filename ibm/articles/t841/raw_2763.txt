=={{Anchor|History}}Etymology==. 
The word "blasphemy" came via [[Middle English]] ''blasfemen'' and [[Old French]] ''blasfemer'' and [[Late Latin]] ''blasphemare'' from [[Greek language|Greek]] βλασφημέω, from βλάπτω = "I injure" and φήμη = "reputation". From ''blasphemare'' also came Old French ''blasmer'', from which English "[[blame]]" came. Blasphemy: 'from Gk. blasphemia "a speaking ill, impious speech, slander," from blasphemein "to speak evil of."'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=blasphemy |title=Online Etymology Dictionary – Blasphemy |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=10 November 2011}}</ref> "In the sense of speaking evil of God this word is found in Ps. 74:18; Isa. 52:5; Rom. 2:24; Rev. 13:1, 6; 16:9, 11, 21. It denotes also any kind of calumny, or evil-speaking, or abuse (1 Kings 21:10; Acts 13:45; 18:6, etc.)."<ref>(from Easton's Bible Dictionary) {{bibleref2|Psalm.74:18;Isaiah.52:5;Romans.2:24||9}} – {{bibleref2|Revelation.13:1;Rev.13:6;Rev.16:9;Rev.16:11;Rev.16:21||9}} – {{bibleref2|1Kings.21:10;Acts.13:45;Acts.18:6||9}}</ref> .

==Christianity==. 
[[File:Jesus graffito.jpg|upright|thumb|The satirical [[Alexamenos graffito]] is believed to be the earliest known [[representation of Jesus]].]]
[[Christian theology]] condemns blasphemy. It is spoken of in [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] [[s:Bible (World English)/Mark#3:29|3:29]], where blaspheming the [[Holy Spirit]] is spoken of as unforgivable—the [[eternal sin]]. However, there is dispute over what form this blasphemy may take and whether it qualifies as blasphemy in the conventional sense.  . 

Blasphemy has been condemned as a serious, or even the most serious, sin by the major creeds and Church theologians. 
*[[Thomas Aquinas]] says that “it is clear that blasphemy, which is a sin committed directly against God, is more grave than murder, which is a sin against one's neighbor. … it is called the most grievous sin, for as much as it makes every sin more grievous.”<ref>Thomas Aquinas: [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3013.htm#article3 ''Summa Theologica''] 2:2, q. 13. </ref>
*The [[Book of Concord]] calls blasphemy “the greatest sin that can be outwardly committed”. <ref>[http://www.bookofconcord.org/lc-3-tencommandments.php ''The Book of Concord''] ''The Large Catechism,'' §55. </ref>
*The ''[[Baptist Confession of Faith]]'' says: “Therefore, to swear vainly or rashly by the glorious and awesome name of God…is sinful, and to be regarded with disgust and detestation. …For by rash, false, and vain oaths, the Lord is provoked and because of them this land mourns.”<ref>[http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/bcof.htm#part23 The Baptist Confession of Faith] Ch. 23, §2–3. </ref>
*''The [[Heidelberg Catechism]]'' answers question 100 about blasphemy by stating that “no sin is greater or provokes God's wrath more than the blaspheming of His Name”. <ref>[http://www.wts.edu/resources/heidelberg.html The Heidelberg Catechism] Q. 100. </ref>
*The ''[[Westminster Confession of Faith|Westminster Larger Catechism]]'' explains that “The sins forbidden in the third commandment are, the abuse of it in an ignorant, vain, irreverent, profane...mentioning...by blasphemy...to profane jests, ...vain janglings, ...to charms or sinful lusts and practices.”<ref>[http://www.reformed.org/documents/wlc_w_proofs/WLC_091-150.html Westminster Larger Catechism] Q. 113. </ref>
*[[Jean Calvin|Calvin]] found it intolerable “when a person is accused of blasphemy, to lay the blame on the ebullition of passion, as if God were to endure the penalty whenever we are provoked.”<ref>Jean Calvin: ''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom06.ii.xvii.html Harmony of the Law]'' vol. 4. Lev. 24:10. </ref> . 

===Catholic prayers and reparations for blasphemy===. 
In the Catholic Church, there are specific prayers and devotions as [[Acts of Reparation]] for blasphemy. <ref>[http://catholicism.about.com/od/prayers/qt/Reparation_HN.htm Act of Reparation for Blasphemies Uttered Against the Holy Name, Righting Wrongs Through Prayer] By Scott P. Richert, About.com</ref> For instance, [[The Golden Arrow Holy Face Devotion (Prayer)]] first introduced by Sister [[Marie of St Peter]] in 1844 is recited "''in a spirit of reparation for blasphemy''". This devotion (started by Sister Marie and then promoted by the Venerable [[Leo Dupont]]) was approved by Pope [[Leo XIII]] in 1885. <ref>* Dorothy Scallan. The Holy Man of Tours. (1990) ISBN 0-89555-390-2</ref> The [[Raccolta]] Catholic prayer book includes a number of such prayers. <ref>Joseph P. Christopher et al., 2003 ''The Raccolta'', St Athanasius Press ISBN 978-0-9706526-6-9</ref> The [[Five First Saturdays]] devotions are done with the intention in the heart of making reparation to the Blessed Mother for blasphemies against her, her name and her holy initiatives.  . 

The [[Holy See]] has specific "Pontifical organizations" for the purpose of the reparation of blasphemy through [[Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ]], e.g. the ''Pontifical Congregation of the [[Benedictine Sisters of the Reparation of the Holy Face]].''<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/2000/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_20001021_riparatrici_en.html Letter for 50th anniversary of the Benedictine Sisters of Reparation of the Holy Face, 2000] Vatican archives</ref>
[[File:Salman-Rushdie-1.jpg|thumb|Writer [[Salman Rushdie]] was accused of blasphemy and subject of a ''[[fatwā]]'' issued by [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]], in February 1989.]] . 

===Death sentence===. 
In Britain's last blasphemy execution, 20-year-old [[Thomas Aikenhead]] was executed for the crime in 1697. He was prosecuted for denying the veracity of the Old Testament and the legitimacy of Christ's miracles. In recent years, George Rosie wrote in the newspaper ''[[The Scotsman]]'' that "The killing of Thomas Aikenhead, like the hounding of [[Salman Rushdie]] for the same 'offence,' was a disgrace…a prime example of a God-fixated state killing a man in an attempt to stop the spread of an idea."<ref name=truth>{{cite web|url=http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/thomasaikenhead.html |title=Thomas Aikenhead |publisher=5.uua.org |accessdate=10 November 2011}}</ref> .

==The United Nations==.

==Colloquial usage==. 
Blasphemy has been used to mean "irreverence" in a non-religious context. Sir Francis Bacon uses "blasphemy" in this way in ''Advancement of Learning'', where he speaks of "blasphemy against teaching".  . 

"Blasphemy" may be used as a substitute for "profanity" or "cursing" as it is used in this sentence: "With much hammering and blasphemy, the locomotive's replacement spring was finally fitted." . 

In contemporary language, the notion of blasphemy is often used [[hyperbole|hyperbolically]]. This usage has garnered some interest among linguists recently, and the word 'blasphemy' is a common case used for illustrative purposes. <ref>
