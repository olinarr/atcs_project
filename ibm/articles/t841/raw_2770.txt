[[File:Everybody Draw Mohammed Day.jpg|thumb|350px|Cartoon, "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day!"]]
'''Everybody Draw Mohammed Day''' was an event held on May 20, 2010 in support of [[free speech]] and freedom of artistic expression of those threatened by violence for drawing [[Depictions of Muhammad|representations of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad]]. It began as a protest against [[censorship]] of an American television show, ''[[South Park]]'', "[[201 (South Park)|201]]" by its distributor, [[Comedy Central]], in response to death threats against some of those responsible for two segments broadcast in April 2010. Observance of the day began with a drawing posted on the Internet on April 20, 2010, accompanied by text suggesting that "everybody" create a drawing representing [[Muhammad]], on May 20, 2010, as a protest against efforts to limit [[freedom of speech]].  . 

U.S. [[cartoon]]ist Molly Norris of [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], created the artwork in reaction to Internet death threats that had been made against cartoonists [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] for depicting Muhammad in an episode of ''[[South Park]]''. [[Depictions of Muhammad]] are explicitly forbidden by a few [[hadith]]s (sayings of and about Muhammad), though not by the [[Qur'an]]. <ref name=USSC>{{Cite web|url={{SCOTUS URL|about/north&southwalls.pdf}} |format=pdf|title=Courtroom Friezes: North and South Walls|author=Office of the Curator|date=May 8, 2003|accessdate=July 8, 2007|work=Information Sheet, Supreme Court of the United States}}</ref> Postings on RevolutionMuslim.com (under the pen name  Abu Talha al-Amrikee; later identified as [[Zachary Adam Chesser]]) had said that Parker and Stone could wind up like [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]], a Dutch filmmaker who was shot to death.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} . 

Norris said that if people draw pictures of Muhammad, [[Islamic terrorism|Islamic terrorists]] would not be able to murder them all, and threats to do so would become unrealistic. Within a week, Norris' idea became popular on [[Facebook]], was supported by numerous [[bloggers]], and generated coverage on the blog websites of major U.S. newspapers. As the publicity mounted, Norris and the man who created the first Facebook page promoting the May 20 event disassociated themselves from it. Nonetheless, planning for the protest continued with others "taking up the cause". <ref name="erases"/> Facebook had an "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" page, which grew to over 100,000 participants (101,870 members by May 20). A protest page on Facebook against the initiative, named "Against ‘Everybody Draw Mohammed Day'", attracted slightly more supporters (106,000 by May 20). <ref name=figure/> Subsequently, Facebook was temporarily blocked by Pakistan; the ban was lifted after Facebook agreed to block the page for users in India and Pakistan.  . 

In the media, Everybody Draw Mohammed Day attracted both support from commentators who felt that the campaign represented important issues of freedom of speech, and the need to stand up for this freedom, as well as criticism from other commentators who found the initiative crass, juvenile, and needlessly offensive.  .

===Background===. 
''[[South Park]]'' episodes "[[200 (South Park)|200]]" and "[[201 (South Park)|201]]", broadcast in April 2010, featured a character in a bear costume, who various other characters stated was Muhammad. <ref>{{Cite news| last =James | first = Frank |coauthors= Mark Memmott | title = Facebook Blocked By Pakistani Court For 'Draw Muhammad' Day | work =[[National Public Radio]]: The two-way | publisher = www.npr.org | date = May 19, 2010 | url = http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/05/facebook_blocked_by_pakistani.html | accessdate =May 19, 2010 }}</ref> The ''South Park'' episode sparked statements from the extremist website [[Revolution Muslim]],<ref>{{Cite news| last = Bates | first = Theunis | title = Pakistan Bans Facebook Over Muhammad Cartoons| work =AOL News | language = | publisher = www.aolnews.com | date =May 19, 2010 | url = http://www.aolnews.com/world/article/pakistan-bans-facebook-over-muhammad-cartoons/19483123 | accessdate =May 19, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| last =Rodriguez | first =Alex | title = Facebook dark in Pakistan amid uproar over Muhammad caricatures|work=Los Angeles Times | publisher = www.latimes.com | date = May 19, 2010 | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-pakistan-facebook-20100520,0,4071401.story | accessdate =May 19, 2010 }}</ref> which posted a picture of the partially decapitated body of the Dutch filmmaker, [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]], with a statement declaring that Parker and Stone could meet a similar fate.

===Molly Norris cartoon===. 
Molly Norris drew the original, poster-like cartoon on April 20, 2010, which declared May 20, 2010, to be the first annual "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day". The drawing showed various [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] objects, including a coffee cup, a cherry and a box of pasta, each claiming to be the likeness of Muhammad. Norris used an alternate [[transliteration]] of "Mohammed" on her poster. <ref name=jotcoelat>Orr, Jimmy, [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2010/04/creators-of-everybody-draw-muhammad-day-abandon-effort-after-it-becomes-controversial.html "Creators of 'Everybody Draw Muhammad Day' drop gag after everybody gets angry"], April 26, 2010, "Top of the Ticket" blog, ''Los Angeles Times''.

In late April, after she had rejected the idea for the May 20 protest, Norris stated on her website: "This was always a drawing about rights, never MEANT to disrespect religion. Alas – if we don't have rights, we will not be able to practice the religion of our choice. [...] None of these little characters ARE the likeness of Mohammed, they are just CLAIMING to be!" She also wrote, "I, the cartoonist, NEVER launched a draw Mohammed day.

===Cartoonist and Facebook page creator end involvement===. 
On April 25, Norris wrote on her website that the response to her idea had surprised and shocked her: "I did not intend for my cartoon to go [[Viral phenomenon|viral]]. I did not intend to be the focus of any 'group'. I practice the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] by drawing what I wish. This particular cartoon of a 'poster' seems to have struck a gigantic nerve, something I was totally unprepared for. I am going back to the drawing table now!"<ref name=mnwco/><ref name="howardfriedman" /> On April 26, she wrote on her website: "I am NOT involved in "Everybody Draw Mohammd [''[[sic]]''&thinsp;] Day!

Many other folks have used my cartoon to start sites, etc. Please go to them as I am a private person who draws stuff". <ref name=jotcoelat/> She also asked Savage to replace the original illustration she had given him with another one she drew that was tamer, but Savage refused. Asked why she initially publicized it, she replied, "Because I'm an idiot."<ref name=jotcoelat/> . 

Norris said the campaign had grown much bigger than she initially intended, and that her cartoon was being used in ways she couldn't control. "I just want to go back to my quiet life", she told the writer of a blog about comics at ''[[The Washington Post]]''. <ref name=mcpspc/> Wellington announced on April 26 that he, too, was dropping out of the movement.

But no one should be beaten or killed or imprisoned simply for speaking their mind or praying to one god as opposed to the other or none at all or getting on with the small business of living their life in peaceful fashion.

Franz Kruger, writing for the ''[[Mail & Guardian]]'', called Everybody Draw Mohammed Day a "silly Facebook initiative" and found "the undertone of a 'clash of civilisations'" in it "disturbing", noting that "it is clear that some feel great satisfaction at what they see as 'sticking it to the Muslims'."<ref>{{Cite news| last =  Kruger| first =Franz | title = Why draw the Prophet? | work =  [[Mail & Guardian]] | date =May 28, 2010  | url =http://www.mg.co.za/article/2010-05-28-why-draw-the-prophet | accessdate = May 30, 2010 }}</ref> The ''Mail & Guardian'', which had itself published a controversial cartoon of Mohammed in its pages, distanced itself from the group, noting that it "claimed to be a protest against restrictions on freedom of speech and religious fanaticism, but had seemingly become a forum for venting Islamophobic sentiment."<ref>{{Cite news| last =  Sapa| title = M&G regrets cartoon offence over prophet | work =  [[The Daily Dispatch]] | date =May 31, 2010  | url =http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=405490 | accessdate = June 11, 2010 }}</ref> [[Hugo Rifkind]], writing for ''[[The Times]]'', called the Facebook initiative a "grubby project": "... there’s something here that makes me twitch.

If a cartoonist wants to satirise Islam by drawing Mohammed, I’m on his side all the way. But among the 13,000 pictures on the EDMD Facebook page, you have Mohammed as a dog in a veil, Mohammed as a pig and Mohammed as a monkey. That’s not resistance, but picking a fight.

In Pakistan, an editorial in ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'', the country's oldest English-language newspaper, said that there was no doubt that the Facebook initiative "was in poor taste and deserving of strong condemnation", adding that it was "debatable whether freedom of expression should extend to material that is offensive to the sensibilities, traditions and beliefs of religious, ethnic or other communities." However, the editorial called the Lahore High Court's decision to block Facebook a "knee-jerk reaction", saying that "many users feel, and rightly so, that they can decide for themselves what is or is not offensive, and choose not to access material that is repugnant to their beliefs" and that the block might "have played right into the hands of those who think nothing of displaying or publishing material that denigrates their beliefs. By reacting the way we do we only harm ourselves and, in the process, even become a subject of derision."<ref>{{Cite news| last =  Staff| title = Facebook furore | work =  [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] | date =May 21, 2010  | url =http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/editorial/19-facebook-furore-150-hh-09 | accessdate = May 30, 2010 }}</ref> . 

===Analysis===. 
The protest movement and incidents surrounding the [[censorship]] of the ''South Park'' episode were discussed on the [[National Public Radio]] program, ''[[Talk of the Nation]]'', where commentators including [[Ross Douthat]] analyzed the phenomenon of Norris withdrawing from the cartoon. <ref name="douthat">{{Cite news| last =Douthat  | first = Ross |authorlink=Ross Douthat | coauthors =  | title =  You Can't Portray Muhammad On TV| work = [[Talk of the Nation]]  | publisher = [[National Public Radio]] | date =April 26, 2010  | url =http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126283217  | accessdate = May 2, 2010 }}</ref> Stephanie Gutmann of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote that she had joined the Facebook group, and commented that if the [[2010 Times Square car bomb attempt]] was found to be related to the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[200 (South Park)|200]]", "this sort of protest will be more important than ever". <ref>{{Cite news| last = Gutmann | first =  Stephanie   | title = Facebook group says make May 20 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day'  |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK | date = May 3, 2010 | url = http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/stephaniegutmann/100037736/facebook-group-says-make-may-20-everybody-draw-mohammed-day/ | accessdate = May 3, 2010 }}</ref> Writing for ''[[The Faster Times]]'', journalist Noah Lederman noted that Norris' cartoon, "was her way of supporting the show’s creators and the First Amendment."<ref>{{Cite news| last = Lederman | first = Noah  | title =South Park, Mohammed, and the First Amendment  | work =[[The Faster Times]] | publisher = thefastertimes.com | date = May 4, 2010 | url =http://thefastertimes.com/hate/2010/05/04/south-park-mohammed-and-the-first-amendment/  | accessdate =May 5, 2010  }}</ref>  Writing for ''[[Financial Times]]'', John Lloyd commented on the decision by Norris to withdraw from the protest movement, and noted, "Molly Norris proposed a 'let’s everyone draw Mohammed day' – then, apparently appalled by her own audacity, backed quickly away."<ref name="johnlloyd">{{Cite news| last =  Lloyd| first =John | title = Hard men and high drama: life imitating art? | work =  [[Financial Times]] | date =May 8, 2010  | url =http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/bbd083d6-595c-11df-99ba-00144feab49a.html  | accessdate = May 9, 2010 }}</ref> . 

Writing for ''[[Religion Dispatches]]'', Austin Dacey compared the protest movement to [[Martin Luther]]: "Forget the ''South Park'' dust up; forget Everybody Draw Muhammad Day. If you want to see truly shocking anti-religious cartoons, you have to go back to the sixteenth century. Near the end of Luther’s life, his propaganda campaign against Rome grew increasingly vitriolic and his language grotesquely pungent."<ref name="austindacey">{{Cite news| last =Dacey  | first = Austin  | title =  Satire is Religion – The debate over cartoons and prophets is not just about free of speech; it’s about freedom of religion.| work = Religion Dispatches | publisher =www.religiondispatches.org | date = May 12, 2010 | url = http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/culture/2561/satire_is_religion/ | accessdate = May 13, 2010 }}</ref> Dacey argued, "The debate over cartoon depictions of the Prophet Muhammad is often framed as a clash between free speech and religious attitudes. But it is just as much a clash between ''conflicting'' religious attitudes, and the freedom at stake is not only freedom of expression but freedom of religion. For while Luther was surely engaging in offensive speech, he was also exercising a right of freedom of conscience, which included the right to dissent from Catholic orthodoxy."<ref name="austindacey" /> . 

In an analysis of the protest movement for the ''[[Daily Bruin]]'', journalist Jordan Manalastas commented, "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day is a chance to reinstate offense and sincerity to their proper place, freed from terror or silence. ... The proper (and, at the risk of looking jingoistic, American) way to combat bad speech is with better speech. To silence and be silenced are the refuge of cowards."<ref>{{Cite news| last = Manalastas | first = Jordan  | title =Cartoonist criticized for creating ‘Everybody Draw Mohammed Day’ should have defended her right to First Amendment  | work = [[Daily Bruin]]  |publisher = www.dailybruin.com, [[University of California, Los Angeles]] | date = May 17, 2010 | url =http://www.dailybruin.com/articles/2010/5/17/cartoonist-criticized-creating-everybody-draw-moha/  | accessdate = May 17, 2010 }}</ref> In an analysis of the protest movement for ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'', Brendan O'Neill was critical of the concept of "mocking Muhammad," writing, "... these two camps – the Muhammad-knockers and the Muslim offence-takers – are locked in a deadly embrace. Islamic extremists need Western depictions of Muhammad as evidence that there is a new crusade against Islam, while the Muhammad-knockers need the flag-burning, street-stomping antics of the extremists as evidence that their defence of the Enlightenment is a risky, important business."<ref>{{Cite news| last = O'Neill | first = Brendan | title =Mocking Muhammad: a shallow Enlightenment  | work =[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked magazine]] | publisher = www.spiked-online.com | date =May 19, 2010  | url = http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/8894/ | accessdate = May 18, 2010 }}</ref> . 

Several [[editorial cartoonist]]s quoted by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' blogger Michael Cavna were critical of the Draw Mohammed Day idea or declined to participate, although all supported the right of cartoonists to depict Mohammed if they chose to. <ref name=Cavna20May>Michael Cavna, [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/comic-riffs/2010/05/their_turn_12_top_cartoonists.html THEIR TURN: 12 top cartoonists offer their take on 'Draw Muhammad Day'], ''[[The Washington Post]]'' blog ''Comics Riff'' (May 20, 2010). </ref>  The president of the [[Association of American Editorial Cartoonists]] opposed involvement because "something like that can be too easily co-opted by interest groups who, I suspect, have an agenda that goes beyond a simple defense of free expression."<ref name=Cavna20May/>  Other cartoonists quoted in the article called the event "childish and needlessly provocative" or demurred because they dislike "choreographed punditry". <ref name=Cavna20May/> . 

Tarek Kahlaoui, an assistant professor of Islamic Art at [[Rutgers University]],<ref>[http://arthistory.rutgers.edu/faculty/bios/kahlaoui/ Tarek Kahlaoui, Rutgers University]</ref> who previously had made comments on Middle Eastern politics in Arabic and English on [[Al-Quds Al-Arabi]] and on Middle East Online, and who also writes a weekly column in the Qatari newspaper Al-Arab. <ref name="Tarek Kahlaoui bio">{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalexpertfinder.org/experts/expert-location/north-america-expert-location/tarek-kahlaoui |title=Tarek Kahlaoui |author= |date=May May 17, 2010 |work= |publisher=The Expert Database |accessdate=July 14, 2010}}</ref>  In an article on Global Expert Finder, analyzed the reasons behind [[Aniconism in Islam|Islamic aniconism]], pointing out that despite aniconism the depiction of Muhammad is not wholly forbidden in Islam, and so in principle it should be possible for non-Muslims to draw him as well, although stating: "What should be an issue, however, are all possible implications between visual representation and bigotry". He also defended [[The First Amendment|the first amendment of the U.S. constitution]] in the way that it's an important right of all Americans. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalexperts.org/comment-analysis/drawing-the-prophet-muhammad-should-not-be-an-issue|title=Drawing the Prophet Muhammad is not the issue|author=Tarek Kahlaoui|date=May 17, 2010|publisher=Global Expert Finder|accessdate=2011-01-27}}</ref> .

===Threat on Molly Norris's life===. 
On July 11, 2010, it was reported that Yemeni-American al-Qaeda cleric [[Anwar al-Awlaki]] had put Molly Norris on a hitlist. In the English-language [[al-Qaeda]] magazine  ''[[Inspire (magazine)|Inspire]]'', Al-Awlaki wrote "The medicine prescribed by the Messenger of Allah is the execution of those involved", and was quoted as saying <blockquote>The large number of participants makes it easier for us because there are more targets to choose from in addition to the difficulty of the government offering all of them special protection ... But even then our campaign should not be limited to only those who are active participants. <ref name="hitlist">[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2010/07/11/2010-07-11_cleric_anwar_alawlaki_puts_everybody_draw_mohammed_cartoonist_molly_norris_on_ex.html "Cleric Anwar al-Awlaki puts 'Everybody Draw Mohammed' cartoonist Molly Norris on execution hitlist"]</ref><ref name="threat">[http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/07/12/death-threats-rattle-everybody-draw-muhammad-day-advocate/7-july-2010 "'Everybody Draw Muhammad Day' Advocate Rattled by Death Threats"]</ref></blockquote>
[[FBI]] officials have reportedly notified Norris warning her they consider it a "very serious threat". <ref name="hitlist" /><ref name="threat" /> . 

Norris has since changed her name and gone into hiding under advice from the FBI. <ref>http://www.seattleweekly.com/2010-09-15/news/on-the-advice-of-the-fbi-cartoonist-molly-norris-disappears-from-view/</ref> .
