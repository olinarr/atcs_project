The publication of [[editorial cartoon|satirical cartoons]] of the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] in the Danish newspaper ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'' on September 30, 2005  led to violence, arrests, inter-governmental tensions, and debate about the scope of free speech and the place of Muslims in the West. Many Muslims claim that any image of Muhammad is [[blasphemy|blasphemous]], while many Westerners have defended the right of [[free speech]]. A number of governments, organizations, and individuals have issued statements defining their stance on the protests or cartoons.  .

[[José Manuel Barroso]], the President of the [[European Commission]],  supported the Danish government saying that freedom of speech cannot be compromised: "It's better to publish too much than not to have freedom.."<ref>{{cite web|date=2006-01-30|title=Cartoon Protesters Rampage in Pakistan|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060214/ap_on_re_mi_ea/prophet_drawings;_ylt=A86.I0r0UfJDWnoAxRlvaA8F;_ylu=X3oDMTA5aHJvMDdwBHNlYwN5bmNhdA--}}</ref> [[Franco Frattini]], the vice-President of the [[European Commission]] and EU Commissioner for Justice, Freedom, and Security, called the publication of the twelve cartoons "thoughtless and inappropriate" in a time when European animosity towards Islam is said to be on the rise. According to Frattini, the cartoons foment hostility against Islam and foreigners.  . 

The European Union on 2006-01-30, said that any retaliatory boycott of Danish goods would violate world trade rules. <ref>{{cite news|first=Constant|last=Brand|date=2006-01-30|title=EU Backs Denmark in caricature dispute|work=BusinessWeek |url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8FF4R0O0.htm?campaign_id=apn_home_down&chan=db}}</ref> . 

On 15 February 2006, the [[European Parliament]] accepted a resolution which condemns all violence arising from the publication of the cartoons. It stated that the EU stands in solidarity with Denmark and all other countries that have been affected by the violence. Furthermore it stated that [[Muslim]]s may be offended by the cartoons and that they have the right to protest peacefully. However the freedom of speech is absolute and may not be affected by any form of censorship. <ref>{{cite news|title=Europa veroordeelt het cartoongeweld (Dutch)|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/nieuwsnet_master/versie2/nieuws/details/060215EuropaCartoons/index.shtml|publisher=Belga|date=2006-02-16}}</ref> .

The ambassadors felt that the reaction of the Danish authorities on the issue was "''under par''" compared to the reaction of other European states which condemned the publication of the cartoons and considered it as a provocation and an incitement to hatred. The member states approved a five-point plan which the OIC Secretary General [[Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu]] had proposed to [[Javier Solana]] on 7 February 2006. The plan called for:
:# the European Union to adopt legislative measures against Islamophobia;
:# the OIC and the EU to work towards a [[United Nations Resolutions|UN Resolution]] on the lines of the existing UN Resolution 60/150 (Combating defamation of religions) which should prohibit defamation of all prophets and faiths;
:# the European media to adopt a code of ethics;
:# the United Nations to adopt an International Communication Media Order covering a definition of freedom of speech in case of religious symbols;
:# the inclusion of a paragraph prohibiting blasphemy, defamation of religions and incitement to hatred in the text of the [[Human Rights Council]] resolution presently being negotiated.  . 

Previously, on 1 January 2006, the OIC decided to boycott a project called "''Images of the Middle East''" which was to be organized by the Danish Center for Culture and Development and partially financed by the Danish Government.

On 28 January 2006, the OIC Secretary General called for "''Muslims to stay calm and peaceful in the wake of sacrilegious depiction of Prophet Muhammad which has deeply hurt their feelings''". <ref>{{cite news|title= OIC Secretary General calls for calm amongst Muslims | publisher=Organization of the Islamic Conference |date= 2006-01-01 | url = http://www.oic-oci.org/press/english/2006/January%202006/denemark-3.htm}}</ref> .

After Iran sent a formal strong objection to the Czech government against the publication of the cartoons in [[MF DNES]] and [[Hospodářské noviny]], the newspapers insisted that it was necessary for them to publish the pictures so that the readers get the full information. The Czech foreign minister Cyril Svoboda called the Muslim reaction "exaggerated" and advocated a united European stand on the issue. <ref>[http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2006/February/middleeast_February334.xml&section=middleeast&col= Khaleejtimes.com]</ref> President [[Václav Klaus]] argued that freedom of speech is only meaningful as a contract between a citizen and a particular government. The Czech government expressed solidarity with Denmark.  . 

===={{flag|Egypt}}====. 
In December 2005, [[Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy]], the Grand [[Imam]] of [[Al-Azhar]] [[Mosque]] and Grand [[Sheikh]] of [[Al-Azhar University]], issued a statement saying that "Al-Azhar intends to protest these anti-Prophet cartoons with the UN's concerned committees and human rights groups around the world."<ref>[http://www.islamonline.net/English/News/2005-12/11/article04.shtml Al-Azhar Takes Anti-Prophet Danish Cartoons to UN] - [[Islamonline.net]], 11 December 2005, islamonline.net</ref> . 

In early January the Egyptian government threatened Denmark with an [[embargo]] of [[List of Danish companies|Danish products]], but did not carry out its threat. Some citizens and major shops started a boycott on their own.  . 

A poll of 1,000 Egyptians in October 2006 revealed that Denmark's image as an enemy to the Egyptian people remained in place.  60% of those polled viewed that Denmark was hostile to Egypt. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6107160.stm Denmark 'Egypt's foe', says poll] - [[BBC News]]. 1 November 2006, news.bbc.co.uk</ref> . 

===={{flag|Finland}}====. 
In February, Finnish Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Erkki Tuomioja]] said that Denmark should have acted earlier and paid more attention to Muslim outrage over the offensive caricatures. He added that the Danish government could apologise for the fact that religious feelings were offended, without endangering freedom of expression. <ref>http://www.hs.fi/english/article/1135218601506</ref> The party of indigenous [[Islam in Finland|Finnish Muslims]], the [[Finnish Islamic Party]], said that it had issued a statement to the media that it condemns the republication of the caricatures and that "We also condemn the Danish government for not interfering in issues that causes confrontation between Islamic world and non-Islamic world. Reissuing the caricatures will cause widely spread agitation because things that Muslims hold sacred have been insulted. Therefore The Finnish Islamic Party exhorts to boikot Danish products everywhere." (verbatim)<ref>http://www.suomenislamilainenpuolue.fi/tiedotteetEN.html</ref> . 

Police opened investigations into the publication of the cartoons by ''[[Suomen Sisu]]''. In Finland it is illegal to "disturb religious peace" (literal translation). This law is rarely prosecuted, giving this incident nation-wide attention. The cartoons have been published on numerous Finnish web sites but not in mainstream media. Police declined to comment which site or sites are being investigated, and said any media that publishes the cartoons will be similarly investigated. <ref>[http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/1135218760533 HS.fi]</ref> . 

On February 24, 2006 ''[[Kaltio]]'', a culture magazine in northern Finland, got publicity for publishing cartoon of a masked prophet Muhammad<ref>[http://paha.suojelupoliisi.org/sarjis/ Paha.suojelupoliisi.org]</ref> which lampooned Finnish political elites' reaction during the cartoon debate. After that some large financial institutions withdrew their advertisements from ''Kaltio'' and the board of the magazine fired their longtime editor Jussi Vilkuna. <ref>[http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/856 Brusselsjournal.com]</ref> . 

===={{flag|France}}====. 
On 6 February 2006, [[Prime Minister of France|French Prime Minister]] [[Dominique de Villepin]] condemned the violence that had occurred internationally in response to the cartoons, but called for tolerance and respect toward other faiths. <ref>{{cite news|title=Protests in France against controversial cartoons|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200602/s1562758.htm|date=2006-02-06|publisher=Agence France-Presse}}</ref> . 

The French foreign minister supported the right to free press, but added that it must be used "in a spirit of tolerance and with respect for beliefs and religions". <ref>{{cite news|title=France enters Muslim cartoon row|date=2006-02-01|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4669360.stm}}</ref> . 

[[Nicolas Sarkozy]], then Interior Minister and presidential candidate, said on [[La Chaîne Info|LCI]] television that he "preferred an excess of caricature to an excess of censorship" and pointed out that it is, if necessary, up to the courts to judge whether caricatures go beyond what is reasonable to publish, and not to the governments of Muslim countries. <ref>{{fr icon}} {{cite news|title=Embarras et inquiétude chez les responsables politiques français|date=2006-02-03|work=Le Monde |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3214,36-737587@51-735567,0.html}}</ref> . 

===={{flag|Germany}}====. 
Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] said that while she understands that feelings were hurt by the caricatures, violent reactions were unacceptable. She stressed the central role of freedom of expression, and called for dialogue. "Denmark must not feel let alone in this issue". Merkel also said that she understands this to be the common position of the E.U. <ref>{{cite news|date=2006-02-04|title=Gewalt und Appelle zur Mäßigung im Karikaturenstreit|url=http://de.today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&storyID=2006-02-04T134849Z_01_MAI449721_RTRDEOC_0_KARIKATURSTREIT-2ZF.xml|publisher=Reuters}}</ref> . 

===={{flag|Indonesia}}====. 
President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] says the Indonesian government condemned the publication of caricature of the Prophet Muhammad. "The publication of the caricature of course reflects a lack of sensitivity to the views and belief of other religious adherents," he said. However, as "religious people", he recommends to "accept the apology". <ref>{{cite news | title = Govt Condemns Publication of Prophet Muhammad's Caricature | publisher=Antara News |date= 2006-02-04 | url = http://www.antara.co.id/en/seenws/?id=8655 }}</ref> . 

===={{flag|Iran}}====. 
On February 2, Iranian president [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] ordered contracts to be cancelled with all countries where media have published the cartoons. On February 5, Iran recalled their ambassador from Denmark, and banned Danish journalists from reporting from Iran. [[Iran]]'s supreme religious leader Ayatollah [[Ali Khamenei]] said on February 6, 2006, that a "Zionist conspiracy" was to blame for the row over the Prophet Muhammad cartoons, in his first reaction to the controversy: "The reason for the Zionist action is because of the loss they suffered by [[Hamas]] winning". Khamenai was referring to Hamas victory in the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006|Palestinian legislative election]]. In fact, the Palestinian election took place almost four months after the cartoons were first posted.  . 

Former Iranian president, [[Mohammad Khatami]] who is also the theorist of [[Dialogue Among Civilizations]], strongly criticized the Danish cartoons for "spreading hatred", but added that the Muslim world is not entirely blameless either:
:"Offending and insulting, is different from expressing an opinion that can be analyzed, argued on, and can eventually be accepted or rejected [therefore offending others is not acceptable] ... But in addition to the west, we ourselves also have problems in this regard. Instead of logical criticism or debate, we only keep saying offensive things about liberalism, democracy and modernism. I had told some of our elders before, that the religion of the today's world is 'liberalism' and we have no right to make insults about it. We should not keep using phrases such as "the corrupt culture of the west" etc. in our words.  As it's also said in the Koran, "Do not insult the gods of others, otherwise you are indirectly insulting your God". <ref>[http://www.isna.ir/Main/NewsView.aspx?ID=News-667116&Lang=P Isna.ir], February 15, 2006. </ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/story/2006/02/060215_jb_khatami_cartoon.shtml BBC.co.uk.co.uk]</ref> . 

There was a recommendation for the term for a "Danish" pastry to be changed to "Gole Mohammadi"(in Persian: Mohammadi Flower). <ref>{{cite news|date=2006-02-07|title=Cartoon Crisis: Iran Renames Danish Pastries|publisher=Adnkronos international|url=http://www.adnki.com/index_2Level.php?cat=Trends&loid=8.0.261677120&par=0}}</ref> . 

The Iranian government retaliated by organizing a [[International Holocaust Cartoon Competition|holocaust cartoon competition]]. Jyllands-Posten was challenged to print the winning cartoons of the competition. It agreed at first but after the competition results were announced, Jyllands-Posten backed down and did not explain why it decided not to print the winning cartoons of the Holocaust cartoon competition. The Iranian government maintained that Jyllands-Posten was never interested in freedom of speech but was just spreading hate ideology.  . 

Some Iranian organizations and media have also backed the publications of cartoons with actions such as organizing demonstrations abroad, republishing caricatures, publishing articles defending them, showing them through Satellite Channels or talk about them in radio.  . 

The following Iranian Organizations are among those who backed the "Freedom of Speech" and publication of Caricatures: Atheists Society, Communist Youth Organization, Communist Youth Organization-Hekmatist, Organization of Iranian Blogwriters, Organization of Women Emancipation, Organization of Women Liberation, [[Worker-Communist Party of Iran]], [[Worker-Communist Party of Iran-Hekmatist]] and Organization of Unity of Iranian People Fedayis.  . 

Iran amended §224-1 of its penal code (prohibition of apostasy, magic and religious innovation, punishable by death, no evidence or witness testimony required - only "the judge's views and impressions") to also cover Defamation of the Prophet [Muhammed]. <ref>{{cite news|date=2008-01-25|title=Iran: Todesstrafe für Abtrünnigkeit und Prophetenbeleidigung|publisher=[[Die Welt]]|url=http://debatte.welt.de/kolumnen/73/periskop/57505/iran+todesstrafe+fuer+abtruennigkeit+und+prophetenbeleidigung+gefordert}}</ref> .

===={{flag|Netherlands}}====. 
The Prime Minister of the Netherlands, [[Jan-Peter Balkenende]], issued the following statement (translated): "I regret the threats from the Muslim world. In our world, when someone crosses a line, we take the matter to court. There is no place here for threats and own direction. (I am) Glad there is freedom of speech here. At the same time we have to realize that our images and ideas can be provocative to others." . 

===={{flag|New Zealand}}====. 
The cartoons were published by two major daily newspapers, the [[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|Dominion Post]] and the [[The Press|Christchurch Press]] (both owned by [[Fairfax Media|Fairfax]] of Australia), and by two smaller newspapers, [[the Nelson Mail]] and the [[National Business Review]]. Fleeting glimpses were also shown on two television networks reporting on the issue. The publication ignited a national debate and prompted a peaceful street protest by New Zealand Muslims in Auckland. The publication of the cartoons was condemned by Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] and opposition leader [[Don Brash]], although they both stated that such decisions were up to newspaper editors to make.  New Zealand has good trading relations with many Islamic countries and there were concerns that the controversy would threaten this. Shortly thereafter the newspapers agreed not to republish the cartoons, and New Zealand Muslim groups, while condemning the cartoons, have asked Muslim countries not to boycott New Zealand goods.  . 

===={{flag|Nigeria}}====. 
On February 7, the parliament of the [[Kano State|State of Kano]] in the [[Islam in Nigeria|Muslim]] north of the country cancelled a €23 million order for Danish buses and banned the sale of all Danish and Norwegian products. Legislators then burned the flags of both nations before a crowd decrying the blasphemy of the caricatures of Muhammad. <ref>[http://www.repubblica.it/2006/b/dirette/sezioni/esteri/vignette/vignet7feb/index.html Cronaca] ''[[La Repubblica]]'' 2006-02-07, repubblica.it</ref> .

[[Pakistan]]'s ambassador urged the Danish prime minister to penalize the cartoonists. From February 14–15 protests have occurred, the largest of which took place in [[Peshawar]] where protestors number over 70,000. <ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25689-2041723,00.html Timesonline.co.uk]</ref> Other cities have also experienced great unrest such as [[Lahore]] where foreign owned businesses such as [[Pizza Hut]], [[Kentucky Fried Chicken|KFC]], and [[McDonalds]] have been burned; [[Islamabad]] where the embassies of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], France, and India were targeted; and Tank, a town 142 miles from Peshawar, where protestors burned down shops selling CDs and DVDs.  . 

On February 17, 2006, Ynetnews.com ran an AP article that claims that an Islamic cleric is offering a monetary reward and a new car for killing cartoonists (implied).  . 

"Mohammed Yousaf Qureshi, prayer leader at the historic Mohabat Khan mosque in the northwestern city of Peshawar, announced the mosque and the Jamia Ashrafia religious school he leads would give a 1.5 million rupee reward and a car for killing the cartoonist of the prophet pictures that appeared first in a Danish newspaper in September.  .

Polish Prime-Minister [[Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz]] said he considered cartoons to be an unnecessary provocation. The Polish government also said they are quite sorry that the newspaper ''[[Rzeczpospolita (newspaper)|Rzeczpospolita]]'' also offended Muslims.  . 

===={{flag|Russia}}====. 
The president of the Institute of the Middle East, Yevgeny Satanovsky, told [[Itar-Tass]] on February 6 that "The caricatures of Prophet Mohammad published as far back as last September angered the entire Islamic world but especially the countries where [[Iran]]’s influence is the strongest, and the apex of the conflict coincided precisely with the discussion of the Iranian nuclear dossier at the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].”  This theory is echoed by Scientific Council of the Moscow Carnegie Centre member, Alexei Malashenko, who believes that “the fuss around the caricatures was made artificially."  That is, at a time when the Muslim world has no concerted position either on the [[Iranian nuclear program]] or [[Hamas]], whose ideology is opposed by moderate Islamic regimes, the caricature uproar provides a “pretext for showing how coherent Muslims are.”<ref>{{cite news|publisher=ITAR-TASS|date=2006-02-06|title=Analysts advise Russia to stay away from “caricature war”|url=http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=2978350&PageNum=0}}</ref> .

In late January 2006, Saudi Arabia recalled its ambassadors for consultations &mdash; a traditional message of diplomatic displeasure.{{Or|date=December 2010}} . 

===={{flag|South Africa}}====. 
An [[Injunction|interdict]] was obtained to prevent newspapers in South Africa from publishing the cartoons. [[Independent Newspapers (South Africa)]] did however publish an article which [[Muslims]] alleged was [[blasphemous]] and for this reason protest marches were arranged. President [[Thabo Mbeki]] reacted to the granting of the interdict by saying that [[court|the courts]] had spoken and that anyone who had objections to the granting of the interdict could pursue the matter as allowed by [[law|the law]]. He went on to say that the courts had the [[obligation]] to balance rights of citizens to [[freedom of speech]] to those of others to be protected from harm or insult. On 3 February [[Mail & Guardian]] however does print the cartoons.{{Or|date=December 2010}} . 

===={{flag|Singapore}}====. 
The Islamic Religious Council of Singapore ([[MUIS]]) issued a statement that said "the inciting of hatred against a faith of a people is very unfortunate," and that "[they] are fortunate and deeply appreciative that in Singapore, the media and the community at large have always been mindful of sensitivities… and have helped to promote racial and religious harmony across society." The Foreign Minister [[George Yeo]] and the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Dr. Yaacob Ibrahim have similarly said that the incident shows the need to respect racial and religious sensitivities, have a "responsible media," and to cultivate good inter-religious relations and confidence beyond just legislation. Later, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that the publication of the cartoons depicting Mohammad was provocative and wrong, but he expressed objection to violent response. <ref>{{cite news|date=2006-02-09|title=Singapore PM: Publication of cartoons on Prophet Mohammad wrong, violent response not right|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-02/09/content_4159200.htm|publisher=Xinhua Online}}</ref> .

Danish-Sudanese relations are extremely poor, as are Sudanese relations with most western countries. On February 27, 2008, Sudan decided to boycott Danish goods after the controversial Muhammad cartoons were reprinted by a series of newspapers in Denmark and other European countries. Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir has backed up the country and other Muslim states, requiring them to boycott Danish products just as Sudan did. He even stated that "No Danes shall ever again be able to set foot in Sudan." The two countries subsequently closed their respective embassies. <ref>http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Sudan_boycotts_Danish_goods</ref> .

But at the same time it is important to say that with this freedom comes a certain responsibility, and it could be objectionable to act in a way that insults people.'' . 

The nationalist party [[Swedish Democrats]] (Sverigedemokraterna) started a competition to draw cartoons of Muhammed on their web site. After words of exhortation from the Swedish government, and in particular from the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Laila Freivalds, the website was shut down. When the story caught wider attention, Freivalds felt it necessesary to resign as Minister for having interfered with [[press freedom]].

[[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British Foreign Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]] criticized European newspapers for republishing the cartoons: "There is freedom of speech, we all respect that, ... But there is not any obligation to insult or to be gratuitously inflammatory. I believe that the republication of these cartoons has been unnecessary. It has been insensitive. It has been disrespectful and it has been wrong." Straw also praises British newspapers for their "considerable responsibility and sensitivity" in not printing the cartoons. <ref>{{cite news | title = Muslim Sabbath Marked by Fury |work=Washington Post |date= 2006-02-04 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/03/AR2006020302604.html | first1=Scott | last1=Wilson | first2=Kevin | last2=Sullivan | accessdate=2010-05-05}}</ref> . 

Notably, even [[Private Eye]], a satirical magazine generally not afraid to publish controversial items, refused to publish the cartoons, instead printing textual descriptions of each of them in turn.

In the U.S. State Department's daily briefing for Friday, February 3, official spokesman Sean McCormick, speaking for the current administration, said (in part), "Our response is to say that while we certainly don't agree with, support, or in some cases, we condemn the views that are aired in public that are published in media organizations around the world, we, at the same time, defend the right of those individuals to express their views. For us, freedom of expression is at the core of our democracy and it is something that we have shed blood and treasure around the world to defend and we will continue to do so. ... So we would urge all parties to exercise the maximum degree of understanding, the maximum degree of tolerance when they talk about this issue. And we would urge dialogue, not violence.
