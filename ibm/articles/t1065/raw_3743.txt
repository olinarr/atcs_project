{{Democracy}}
'''Islamic democracy''' refers to two kinds of [[democracy|democratic]] states that can be recognized in the [[Muslim world|Islamic countries]]. The basis of this distinction has to do with how comprehensively [[Islam]] is incorporated into the affairs of the state. <ref name=autogenerated2>{{Citation |first=Najib |last=Ghadbian |title=Democracy or Self-Interest? |journal=Harvard International Review |date=6 May 2006 |url=http://hir.harvard.edu/china/democracy-or-self-interest |accessdate=19 Oct 2011}}</ref> . 

#A democratic [[State (polity)|state]] which recognizes Islam as [[state religion]], such as [[Malaysia]], [[Algeria]], or [[Maldives]] are examples of Islamic Democracy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Some religious values are incorporated into public life, but Islam is not the only source of law. 
#A democratic state which endeavours to institute ''[[Sharia]]''. It is also called as '''Islamist democracy'''. <ref name=autogenerated2 /> [[Islamist]] democracy offers more comprehensive inclusion of Islam into the affairs of the state. States like [[Iran]] are firm proponents of this form. <ref name=autogenerated2 /> .

The concepts of liberalism and democratic participation were already present in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]]. <ref>{{citation|title=Justice Without Frontiers|first=Christopher G.|last=Judge Weeramantry|year=1997|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|isbn=90-411-0241-8|pages=134–5}}</ref><ref>{{citation|first=Antony T.|last=Sullivan|title=Istanbul Conference Traces Islamic Roots of Western Law, Society|journal=[[Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]]|date=January–February 1997|page=36|url=http://www.washington-report.org/backissues/0197/9701036.htm|accessdate=2008-02-29}}</ref><ref>Lenn Evan Goodman (2003), ''Islamic Humanism'', p. 155, [[Oxford University Press]], ISBN 0-19-513580-6. </ref> Azizah Y. al-Hibri, for example, argues that [[Medina]] during Muhammad's time was an early example of a democratic state but that the development of democracy in the Islamic world eventually came to a halt following to the [[Shia–Sunni relations|Sunni–Shia split]]. <ref>{{citation|title=Islamic and American Constitutional Law: Borrowing Possibilities or a History of Borrowing|last=al-Hibri|first=Azizah Y.|journal=[[University of Pennsylvania Journal of Constitutional Law]]|volume=1|issue=3|year=1998-1999|pages=492–527 [507–25]}}</ref> .

A study by [[Monash University]] professor Sayed Khatab discussed the compatibility of Islam and democracy. His book ''Democracy in Islam'', (Routledge 2007) is a challenge to extremism. This book is also a significant contribution to the UNESCO program of intercultural relations. He outlined that the democratic ideal of a "government by the people" is compatible with the notion of an Islamic democracy. Deliberations of the [[Caliphate]]s were not{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} democratic in the modern sense (rather, decision-making power lay with a council of notables or clan [[patriarch]]s), they show that some appeals to popular consent are permissible (though not necessarily required) within Islam. <ref>Sohaib N. Sultan, [http://www.islamonline.net/English/introducingislam/politics/Politics/article04.shtml Forming an Islamic Democracy]</ref> (see also: [[Shura]]).  . 

In the early [[Islamic Caliphate]], the head of state, the [[Caliph]], had a position based on the notion of a successor to Muhammad's political authority, who, according to [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]], were ideally elected by the people or their representatives,<ref>''Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World'' (2004), vol. 1, p. 116-123. </ref> as was the case for [[the election of Uthman]] and [[Ali as Caliph]]. After the [[Rashidun]] Caliphs, later Caliphates during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] had a lesser degree of democratic participation, but since "no one was superior to anyone else except on the basis of piety and virtue" in Islam, and following the example of  Muhammad, later Islamic rulers often held [[public consultation]]s with the people in their affairs. <ref>{{citation|title=Justice Without Frontiers|first=Christopher G.|last=Judge Weeramantry|year=1997|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|isbn=90-411-0241-8|pages=135}}</ref> . 

The power of the Caliph (or later, the [[Sultan]]) was restricted by the scholarly class, the ''[[Ulema]]'', a group regarded as the guardians of the law. Since the law came from the legal scholars, this prevented the Caliph from dictating legal results. Laws were decided based on the ''[[Ijma]]'' (consensus) of the [[Ummah]] (community), which was most often represented by the legal scholars. <ref name=Feldman>{{Cite web|author=Noah Feldman|title=Why Shariah?|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=March 16, 2008|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/magazine/16Shariah-t.html?ei=5070&em=&en=5c1b8de536ce606f&ex=1205812800&pagewanted=all|accessdate=2008-10-05}}</ref> In order to qualify as a legal scholar, it was required that they obtain a [[doctorate]] known as the ''[[Ijazah|ijazat attadris wa 'l-ifttd]]'' ("license to teach and issue legal opinions") from a ''[[Madrasah]]''. <ref name=G-Makdisi>{{citation|last=Makdisi|first=George|title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=109|issue=2|date=April–June 1989|pages=175–182 [175–77]}}</ref> In many ways, classical Islamic law functioned like a [[constitutional law]]. <ref name=Feldman/> . 

Democratic [[religious pluralism]] also existed in classical Islamic law, as the [[religious law]]s and [[court]]s of other religions, including [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]] and [[Hinduism]], were usually accommodated within the Islamic legal framework, as seen in the early Caliphate, [[Al-Andalus]], [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Islamic India]], and the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman Millet]] system. <ref>{{citation|title=Justice Without Frontiers|first=Christopher G.|last=Judge Weeramantry|year=1997|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|isbn=90-411-0241-8|pages=138}}</ref><ref name=Sachedina>{{citation|title=The Islamic Roots of Democratic Pluralism|first=Abdulaziz Abdulhussein|last=Sachedina|year=2001|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-513991-7}}</ref> . 

Much debate occurs on the subject of which Islamic traditions are fixed principles, and which are subject to democratic change, or other forms of modification in view of changing circumstances. Some [[Muslim]]s allude to an "Islamic" style of democracy which would recognize such distinctions. <ref>[http://www.muslimnews.co.uk/news/news.php?article=11311 The Muslim News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Another sensitive issue involves the status of monarchs and other leaders, the degree of loyalty which Muslims owe such people, and what to do in case of a conflicting loyalties (e.g., if a monarch disagrees with an [[imam]]).  . 

==Shi'a viewpoint== . 

According to the [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] understanding, [[Succession to Muhammad|Muhammad named as his successor]] (as leader, with Muhammad being the [[Last prophet|final prophet]]), his son-in-law [[Ali]]. Therefore the first three of the four "Rightly Guided" Caliphs recognized by Sunnis ('Ali being the fourth), are considered usurpers, notwithstanding their having been "elected" through some sort of conciliar deliberation (which the Shia do not accept as a representative of the Muslim society of that time). The largest Shi'a grouping &mdash; the [[Twelver]]s branch  &mdash; recognizes a series of [[The Twelve Imams|Twelve Imams]], the last of which ([[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], the Hidden Imam) is still alive and the Shi'a are waiting for his reappearance. 
Since the revolution in Iran, Twelver Shi'a political thought has been dominated by the [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]]. Imam Khomeini argued that in the absence of the Hidden Imam and other divinely-appointed figures (in whom ultimate political authority rests), Muslims have not only the right, but also the obligation, to establish an "Islamic state."<ref>http://quest4truth.weebly.com/imam-03.html</ref> To that end they must turn to scholars of Islamic law ([[fiqh]]) who are qualified to interpret the [[Qur'an]] and the writings of the imams. Khomeini distinguishes between [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Conventional Fiqh]] and Dynamic Fiqh, which he believes to also be necessary.  . 

Khomeini divides the Islamic commandments or [[Ahkam]] into three branches: . 

* the primary commandments ({{lang-fa|حكم اوليه}})
* the secondary commandments ({{lang-fa|حكم ثانويه}}) and
* the state commandments ({{lang-fa|حكم حكومتي}}).  . 

This list includes all commandments which relate to public affairs, such as [[constitution]]s, [[social security]], [[insurance]], [[bank]], [[labour law]], [[tax]]ation, elections, [[congress]] etc. Some of these codes may not strictly or implicitly pointed out in the Qur'an and generally in the [[Sunnah]], but should not violate any of the two, unless there's a collision of rules in which the more important one is given preference (an apparent, but not inherent, violation of a rule). Therefore, Khomeini emphasized that the (elected) Islamic state has absolute right ({{lang-fa|ولايت مطلقه}}) to enact [[state commandments]], even if it (appears as if it) violates the primary or secondary commandments of Islam. This should happen when a more important primary or secondary commandment is in danger because of some limitations.  . 

For example an (elected) Islamic state can ratify (according to some constitutions) mandatory insurance of employees to all employers being Muslim or not even if it violates mutual consent between them. This shows the compatibility of Islam with modern forms of social codes for present and future life,<ref>[http://www.gazellebookservices.co.uk/ISBN/1904063187.htm 1904063187 : 9781904063186:Theory of Religious Democracy<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> as various countries and nations may have different kinds of constitutions now and will may have new ones in future. <ref>[http://www.nezam.org/english/wilayah_jawadi.htm :: www.Majlesekhobregan.ir ::. -> Magazines -> Islamic Government] Dead link</ref> . 

==Philosophical viewpoint== . 

The [[Early Islamic philosophy|early Islamic philosopher]], [[Al-Farabi]] (c. 872-950), in one of his most notable works ''Al-Madina al-Fadila'', theorized an ideal [[Islamic state]] which he compared to [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]''. <ref name=Stanford>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arabic-islamic-natural Arabic and Islamic Natural Philosophy and Natural Science], ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''</ref> Al-Farabi departed from the [[Platonism|Platonic]] view in that he regarded the ideal state to be ruled by the [[Prophets of Islam|prophet]]-imam, instead of the [[philosopher king]] envisaged by Plato. Al-Farabi argued that the ideal state was the [[city-state]] of [[Medina]] when it was governed by Muhammad as its [[head of state]], as he was in direct communion with [[God in Islam|God]] whose law was revealed to him. In the absence of the prophet-imam, Al-Farabi considered democracy as the closest to the ideal state, regarding the [[republic]]an order of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] as an example within early [[Muslim history]]. However, he also maintained that it was from democracy that imperfect states emerged, noting how the republican order of the early Islamic Caliphate of the Rashidun caliphs was later replaced by a form of government resembling a [[monarchy]] under the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] dynasties. <ref>{{citation|title=Justice and Democracy|last=Ronald Bontekoe|first=Mariėtta Tigranovna Stepaniants|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|year=1997|isbn=0-8248-1926-8|page=251}}</ref> . 

A thousand years later, the modern [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]], [[Muhammad Iqbal]] (1877–1938), also viewed the early Islamic Caliphate as being compatible with democracy. He "welcomed the formation of popularly elected [[Legislative Assembly|legislative assemblies]]" in the Muslim world as a "return to the original purity of Islam." He argued that Islam had the "germs of an economic and democratic organization of society", but that this growth was stunted by the expansive [[Muslim conquests]], which established the Caliphate as a great [[Caliphate|Islamic empire]] but led to [[Political aspects of Islam|political Islam]]ic ideals being "[[Paganism|repaganized]]" and the early Muslims losing sight of the "most important potentialities of their faith."<ref>{{citation|title=Justice and Democracy|last=Ronald Bontekoe|first=Mariėtta Tigranovna Stepaniants|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|year=1997|isbn=0-8248-1926-8|page=253}}</ref> . 

==Islamic democracy in practice==. 
{{Refimprove|date=July 2007}}
{{See also|Shura|Ijma}}
Legal scholar L. Ali Khan argues that Islam is fully compatible with democracy. In his book, ''A Theory of Universal Democracy'', Khan provides a critique of [[liberal democracy]] and secularism. He presents the concept of "fusion state" in which religion and state are fused. There are no contradictions in God's universe, says Khan. Contradictions represent the limited knowledge that human beings have. According to the Qur'an and the Sunnah, Muslims are fully capable of preserving spirituality and self-rule. <ref>[http://hosted.law.wisc.edu/wilj/abstracts/161.htm See abstract]</ref> . 

Furthermore, counter arguments to these points assert that this attitude presuppose democracy as a static system which only embraces a particular type of [[society|social]] and [[Culture|cultural]] system, namely that of the post-Christian [[Western world|West]]. ''See: [[constitutional theocracy]]''.  . 

Muslim democrats, including [[Ahmad Moussalli]] (professor of [[political science]] at the [[American University of Beirut]]), argue that concepts in the Qur'an point towards some form of democracy, or at least away from [[despotism]]. These concepts include ''shura'' (consultation), ''ijma'' (consensus), ''al-hurriyya'' (freedom), ''al-huqquq al-shar'iyya'' (legitimate rights). For example ''shura'' (Aal `Imran 3:159, Ash-Shura 42:38) may include electing leaders to represent and govern on the community’s behalf. Government by the people is not therefore necessarily incompatible with the rule of Islam, whilst it has also been argued that rule by a religious authority is not the same as rule by a representative of [[Allah]]. This viewpoint, however, is disputed by more traditional Muslims. Moussalli argues that despotic Islamic governments have abused the Qur'anic concepts for their own ends: "For instance, shura, a doctrine that demands the participation of society in running the affairs of its government, became in reality a doctrine that was manipulated by political and religious elites to secure their economic, social and political interests at the expense of other segments of society," (In ''Progressive Muslims'' 2003).  . 

A further argument against Islamic democracy in practice, is that some democratic governments in Islamic states are not homegrown, but imposed by the West, such as the one in [[Afghanistan]] and the nascent post-[[Ba'ath Party|Baathist]] regime in [[Iraq]]. <ref>[http://www.khilafah.com/home/category.php?DocumentID=11722&TagID=2 Khilafah.com - US influence in Iraq constitution ‘excessive’<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . 

As of 2010, [[United States|U.S.]]-based organization [[Freedom House]] considers [[Indonesia]] and [[Mali]] as the only Muslim-majority countries that are fully-fledged [[List of indices of freedom|free]] [[Electoral democracy|electoral democracies]]. <ref>[http://freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=363&year=2009 Map of Freedom in the World, 2009 Edition] at [[Freedom House]] website</ref>. In 2011, the [[Democracy Index]] by the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] rated Indonesia (60th), Mali (62nd) and [[Malaysia]] (=71st) as the only Muslim-majority countries to reach the "flawed democracy" category, with none being in the "full democracy" category. Some of the larger Muslim countries such as [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Turkey]] and [[Iraq]] appeared in the "hybrid regime" category". As a result of the [[Tunisian Revolution|2011 revolution]] [[Tunisia]] was also upgraded to a hybrid regime.  . 

===Pakistan===. 
Pakistan started off as an example of the first category, but has moved towards a more religiously conservative state during [[Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization]] in the 1980s. Since then, the relation of  state and religion fluctuates with the party in power, though frequent [[Coup d'état|military coups]] have halted its democratic evolution.  . 

===Middle East===. 
{{See also|Democracy in the Middle East}} . 

Waltz writes that transformations to democracy seemed on the whole to pass by the Islamic [[Middle East]] at a time when such transformations were a central theme in other parts of the world, although she does note that, of late, the increasing number of elections being held in the region indicates some form of adoption of democratic traditions. <ref>Waltz, S.E., 1995, ''Human Rights & Reform: Changing the Face of North African Politics'', London, University of California Press Ltd</ref> There are several ideas on the relationship between Islam in the Middle East and democracy. Writing on [[The Guardian]] website,<ref name="guard">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,,1169776,00.html Beware instant democracy]</ref> [[Brian Whitaker]], the paper's Middle East editor, argued that there were four major obstacles to democracy in the region: the [[Colonialism|Imperial legacy]], oil wealth, the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] and militant or "backward-looking" Islam.  . 

The imperial legacy includes the borders of the modern states themselves and the existence of significant minorities within the states. Acknowledgment of these differences is frequently suppressed usually in the cause of "national unity" and sometimes to obscure the fact that minority elite is controlling the country. Brian Whitaker argues that this leads to the formation of political parties on ethnic, religious or regional divisions, rather than over policy differences. Voting therefore becomes an assertion of one's identity rather than a real choice.  . 

The problem with [[petroleum|oil]] and the wealth it generates is that the states' rulers have the wealth to remain in power, as they can pay off or repress most potential opponents. Brian Whitaker argues that as there is no need for taxation there is less pressure for representation. Furthermore, Western governments require a stable source of oil and are therefore more prone to maintain the status quo, rather than push for reforms which may lead to periods of instability. This can be linked into [[political economy]] explanations for the occurrence of [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regimes and lack of democracy in the Middle East, particularly the prevalence of [[rentier state]]s in the Middle East. <ref>Beblawi, H., 1990, The Rentier State in the Arab World, in Luciani, G., ''The Arab State'', London, Routledge</ref> A consequence of the lack of taxation that Whitaker talks of in such rentier economies is an inactive [[civil society]]. As civil society is seen to be an integral part of democracy it raises doubts over the feasibility of democracy developing in the Middle East in such situations. <ref name=autogenerated1>Weiffen, B., 2004, The Cultural-Economic Syndrome: Impediments to Democracy in the Middle East, www.dur.ac.uk/john.ashworth/EPCS/Papers/Weiffen.pdf</ref> . 

Whitaker's third point is that the [[Arab]]–[[Israelis|Israeli]] conflict serves as a unifying factor for the countries of the [[Arab League]], and also serves as an excuse for repression by Middle Eastern governments. For example, in March 2004 [[Sheikh]] [[Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah]], [[Lebanon]]'s leading Shia cleric, is reported as saying "We have emergency laws, we have control by the security agencies, we have stagnation of opposition parties, we have the appropriation of political rights - all this in the name of the Arab-Israeli conflict". The West, especially the [[United States|USA]], is also seen as a supporter of [[Israel]], and so it and its institutions, including democracy, are seen by many Muslims as suspect. [[Khaled Abou El Fadl]], a lecturer in Islamic law at the [[University of California]] comments "modernity, despite its much scientific advancement, reached Muslims packaged in the ugliness of disempowerment and alienation." . 

This repression by Arab rulers has led to the growth of radical Islamic movements, as they believe that the institution of an Islamic theocracy will lead to a more just society. However, these groups tend to be very intolerant of alternative views, including the ideas of democracy. Many Muslims who argue that Islam and democracy are compatible live in the West, and are therefore seen as "contaminated" by non-Islamic ideas. <ref name="guard"/> . 

[[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] scholars offer another viewpoint on the relationship between Islam and [[Democratization|democratisation]] in the Middle East. They argue that the compatibility is simply not there between secular democracy and Arab-Islamic culture in the Middle East which has a strong history of undemocratic beliefs and authoritarian power structures. <ref name=autogenerated1 /> [[Elie Kedourie|Kedourie]], a well known Orientalist scholar, said for example: "to hold simultaneously ideas which are not easily reconcilable argues, then, a deep confusion in the Arab public mind, at least about the meaning of democracy. The confusion is, however, understandable since the idea of democracy is quite alien to the mind-set of Islam."<ref>Kedourie, E., 1994, ''Democracy and Arab Political Culture'', London, Frank Cass & Co Ltd, page 1</ref> A view similar to this that understands Islam and democracy to be incompatible because of seemingly irreconcilable differences between Sharia and democratic ideals is also held by some Islamists. However, within Islam there are ideas held by some that believe Islam and democracy in some form are indeed compatible due to the existence of the concept of Shura (meaning consultation) in the Qur’an. Views such as this have been expressed by various thinkers and political activists in the Middle East. <ref>Esposito, J. & Voll, J.,2001, Islam and Democracy, ''Humanities'', Volume 22, Issue 6</ref> They continue to be the subject of controversy, e.g. at the second [[Dubai Debates]], which debated the question "Can Arab and Islamic values be reconciled with democracy?"
<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFwArelc04]</ref> . 

===Iran===. 
==== Theory ====. 
The idea and concept of Islamic democracy has been accepted by many Iranian clerics, scholars and intellectuals. <ref name=autogenerated3>[http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=6426&sec=59&con=33 WorldWide Religious News-President Says Democracy Conforms With Religion in Iran<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.khatami.ir/ Official Website of Seyyed Mohammad Khatami | khatami.ir<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.drsoroush.com AbdolKarim Soroush:: عبدالکريم سروش<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.leader.ir/langs/EN/index.php?p=news&id=3447 The Office of the Supreme Leader, Sayyid Ali Khamenei<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.khamenei.ir/EN/News/detail.jsp?id=20031220A Dead link]</ref> The most notable of those who have accepted the theory of Islamic Democracy is probably Iran's Leader, Ayatollah [[Ali Khamenei]], who mentions Islamic Democracy as "Mardomsalarie Dini" in his speeches.  . 

There are also other Iranian scholars who oppose or at least criticise the concept of Islamic democracy. Among the most popular of them are Ayatollah Makarim al-Shirazi<ref>[http://www.makaremshirazi.org/ Makarim al-Shirazi]</ref> who have written: "If not referring to the people votes would result in accusations of tyranny then it is allowed to accept people vote as a secondary commandment."<ref>انوار الفقاهه- كتاب البيع - ج 1 ص 516</ref> Also [[Mohammad-Taqi Mesbah-Yazdi]] has more or less the same viewpoint.  . 

On the other hand, clergy like [[Yousefi Eshkevari]] believe that: ''The obligatory religious commandments in public domain not necessarily imply recognition of religious state. These obligations can be interpreted as the power of Muslims' religious conscience and applying that through civil society''. <ref>[http://www.ibtauris.com/ibtauris/display.asp?ISB=1845111346&TAG=&CID= Dead link]</ref> These clergies strictly reject the concept of Islamic state regardless of being democratic or not. They also believe no relationship between Islam and democracy at all, opposing the interpretation of clergy like Ayatollah Makarim al-Shirazi from Islamic state. But they do not mention how legal laws as an example can not be implemented using civil societies and how to administer a country relying on conscience only.  . 

====Practice====. 
Some Iranians, including [[Mohammad Khatami]], categorize the [[Islamic republic]] of Iran as a kind of religious democracy. <ref>[http://www2.irna.com/en/news/view/line-17/0702089736162511.htm Envoy: Religious democracy materialized by Islamic Revolution - Irna<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> They maintain that Ayatollah Khomeini held the same view as well and that's why he strongly chose "Jomhoorie Eslami" (Islamic Republic) over "Hokoomate Eslami" (Islamic State).  . 

Other maintain that not only is the Islamic Republic of Iran undemocratic (see [[Politics of Iran]]) but that Khomeini himself opposed the principle of democracy in his book [[Hokumat-e Islami : Velayat-e faqih (book by Khomeini)|Hokumat-e Islami: Wilayat al-Faqih]], where he denied the need for any legislative body saying, "no one has the right to legislate ... except ... the Divine Legislator", and during the Islamic Revolution, when he told Iranians, "Do not use this term, 'democratic.' That is the Western style."<ref>Bakhash, Shaul, ''The Reign of the Ayatollahs'', p.73</ref> (Although it is in contrast with his commandment to [[Bazargan]] (see [[Iranian Revolution]]). It is a subject of lively debate among pro-Islamic Iranian [[wikt:intelligentsia|intelligentsia]]. Also they maintain that Iran's sharia courts, the [[Islamic Revolutionary Court]], [[blasphemy laws of the Islamic Republic of Iran]], and the [[Mutaween]] (religious police) violate the principles of democratic governance. <ref>[http://www.memritv.org/Transcript.asp?P1=401 Khatami Clashes with Reformist Students at Tehran University]</ref> However, it should be understood that when a democracy is accepted to be Islamic by people, the law of Islam becomes the democratically ratified law of that country. Iranians have ratified the constitution in which the principle rules are explicitly mentioned as the rules of Islam to which other rules should conform.  . 

===Philippines===. 
Islamic democracy entered into mainstream politics after the government and the [[Moro National Liberation Front]] signed a peace deal establishing the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]]. A political party (Union of Muslim Democrats of the Philippines) was established in order to allow Muslims to participate further in the democratic system. This party became the ruling party of that region. Currently, the party has merged with a major party of the nation [[Lakas-CMD|Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats]], a political party incorporating elements of both [[Christian democracy|Christian]] and Islamic democracy.  . 

==Islamic democratic parties==. 
The following political parties have been described as Islamic democratic.  . 

* {{flag|Egypt}} - [[Freedom and Justice Party (Egypt)|Freedom and Justice Party]] (FJP)
* {{flag|Indonesia}} - [[Prosperous Justice Party]] (PKS)
* {{flag|Indonesia}} - [[National Awakening Party]] (PKB)
* {{flag|Malaysia}} - [[United Malay National Organization]] (UMNO)
* {{flag|Malaysia}} - [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party]] (PAS)
* {{flag|Morocco}} - [[Justice and Development Party (Morocco)|Justice and Development Party]] (PJD)

* {{flag|Philippines}} - [[Lakas – Christian Muslim Democrats]] (CMD)
* {{flag|Tunisia}} - [[Ennahda Movement]]
* {{flag|Turkey}} - [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) . 

The [[National Transitional Council]] in [[Libya]], which has no officially recognized political parties, has also expressed its intention of leading the country based on a civil, democratic state in which ''sharia'' will be the main source of legislation. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.di-ve.com/Default.aspx?ID=72&Action=1&NewsId=86124&newscategory=31|agency=DI-VE|title=Libyan rebels pledge democracy based on moderate Islam|date=13 September 2011|accessdate=13 September 2011}}</ref> . 

==Indices of democracy in Muslim countries== . 

There are several non-governmental organizations that publish and maintain [[List of freedom indices|indices of freedom]] in the world, according to their own various definitions of the term, and rank countries as being free, partly free, or unfree using various measures of freedom, including political rights, economic rights, freedom of the press and civil liberties.  . 

The following lists [[List of Muslim-majority countries|muslim-majority countries]] and shows the scores given by two frequently used indices: [[Freedom in the World]] (2012) by the US-based [[Freedom House]] and the 2011 [[Democracy Index]] by the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]. These indices are frequently used in western media, but have attracted some [[Freedom House#criticism|criticism]] and may not reflect recent changes.  .
