{{Democracy}}
'''Liberal democracy''', also known as '''constitutional democracy''', is a common form of [[representative democracy]].  According to the principles of liberal democracy, [[elections]] should be free and fair, and the political process should be competitive. Political [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] is usually defined as the presence of multiple and distinct [[political parties]].  . 

A liberal democracy may take various constitutional forms: it may be a [[constitutional republic]], such as [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], or the [[United States]], or a [[constitutional monarchy]], such as [[Japan]], [[Spain]], or the [[United Kingdom]]. It may have a [[presidential system]] ([[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], the [[United States]]), a [[semi-presidential system]] ([[Finland]], [[France]], [[Republic of China|Taiwan]]), or a [[parliamentary system]] ([[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[India]], [[New Zealand]], [[Poland]], the [[United Kingdom]]).  . 

==Structure==. 
{{See also|Elective rights}}
The Liberal democracies usually have [[universal suffrage]], granting all [[adult]] citizens the right to vote regardless of race, gender or property ownership. Historically, however, some countries regarded as liberal democracies have had a more [[Suffrage#Forms of exclusion from suffrage|limited franchise]], and some do not have [[secret ballot]]s. There may also be qualifications such as voters being required to register before being allowed to vote. The decisions made through elections are made not by all of the citizens, but rather by those who choose to participate by voting.  . 

The liberal democratic [[constitution]] defines the democratic character of the state. The purpose of a constitution is often seen as a limit on the authority of the government. Liberal democracy emphasises the [[separation of powers]], an independent judiciary, and a system of [[checks and balances]] between branches of government. Liberal democracies are likely to emphasise the importance of the state being a [[Rechtsstaat]] that follows the principle of [[rule of law]]. Governmental authority is legitimately exercised only in accordance with written, publicly disclosed [[laws]] adopted and enforced in accordance with established procedure. Many democracies use [[Federation|federalism]]—also known as vertical separation of powers—in order to prevent abuse and increase public input by dividing governing powers between municipal, provincial and national governments.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} . 

[[Image:Parliament building Finland.jpg|thumb|right|175px|''[[Eduskunta]]''. Several nations and territories can present arguments for being the first with [[universal suffrage]]. The [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] had complete universal suffrage in 1906.]] . 

===Rights and freedoms===. 
In practice, democracies do have specific limits on specific freedoms. There are various legal limitations such as [[copyright]] and laws against [[defamation]]. There may be limits on anti-democratic speech, on attempts to undermine [[human rights]], and on the promotion or justification of [[terrorism]]. In the United States more than in Europe, during the [[Cold War]], such restrictions applied to [[Communism|Communists]]. Now they are more commonly applied to organizations perceived as promoting actual terrorism or the incitement of group hatred. Examples include [[anti-terrorism legislation]], the shutting down of [[Hezbollah]] satellite broadcasts, and some laws against [[hate speech]]. Critics claim that these limitations may go too far and that there may be no due and fair judicial process.  . 

The common justification for these limits is that they are necessary to guarantee the existence of democracy, or the existence of the freedoms themselves. For example, allowing free speech for those advocating mass murder undermines the right to life and security. Opinion is divided on how far democracy can extend to include the enemies of democracy in the democratic process. If relatively small numbers of people are excluded from such freedoms for these reasons, a country may still be seen as a liberal democracy. Some argue that this is only quantitatively (not qualitatively) different from autocracies that persecute opponents, since only a small number of people are affected and the restrictions are less severe. Others emphasize that democracies are different. At least in theory, opponents of democracy are also allowed due process under the rule of law. In principle, democracies allow criticism and change of the leaders and the political and economic system itself; it is only attempts to do so violently and the promotion of such violence that is prohibited.  . 

However, many governments considered to be democratic have restrictions upon expressions considered anti-democratic, such as [[Holocaust denial]]{{citation needed|date=April 2011|comment=Holocaust denial is anti-Semitic, not anti-democratic}} and [[hate speech]]. Members of political organizations with connections to prior totalitarianism (typically Soviet-style-Communist, [[Fascism|fascist]], and [[far-right]] [[Nazi]]) parties prohibited and current or former members of such organizations may be deprived of the vote and the privilege of holding certain jobs. [[Discrimination|Discriminatory]] behavior may be prohibited, such as refusal by owners of public accommodations to serve persons on grounds of race, religion, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation. For example, in Canada, a printer who refused to print materials for the Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives was fined $5,000, incurred $100,000 in legal fees, and was ordered to pay a further $40,000 of his opponents' legal fees by the Human Rights Tribunal. <ref>{{cite web|title=Christian Business Ordered to Duplicate Homosexual Activist |publisher=Concerned Women for America|url=http://www.cwfa.org/articles/10594/CFI/family/index.htm|archiveurl=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20081128171655/http://www.cwfa.org/articles/10594/CFI/family/index.htm|archivedate=2008-11-28}}</ref> . 

Other rights considered fundamental in one country may be foreign to other governments. For instance, the constitutions of Canada, India, Israel, Mexico and the United States guarantee freedom from [[double jeopardy]], a right not provided in other legal systems.  Similarly, many Americans consider [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|gun rights]] to be important, while other countries do not recognize them as fundamental rights.  . 

===Preconditions===. 
Although they are not part of the system of government as such, a modicum of [[individual rights|individual]] and [[economic freedom]]s, which result in the formation of a significant [[middle class]] and a broad and flourishing [[civil society]], are often seen as pre-conditions for liberal democracy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} . 

For countries without a strong tradition of democratic majority rule, the introduction of free elections alone has rarely been sufficient to achieve a transition from dictatorship to democracy; a wider shift in the political culture and gradual formation of the institutions of democratic government are needed. There are various examples—for instance, in [[Latin America]]—of countries that were able to sustain democracy only temporarily or in a limited fashion until wider cultural changes established the conditions under which democracy could flourish.  . 

One of the key aspects of democratic culture is the concept of a "[[loyal opposition]]". This is an especially difficult cultural shift to achieve in nations where transitions of power have historically taken place through violence. The term means, in essence, that all sides in a democracy share a common commitment to its basic values. Political competitors may disagree, but they must tolerate one another and acknowledge the legitimate and important roles that each play. The ground rules of the society must encourage tolerance and civility in public debate. In such a society, the losers accept the judgment of the voters when the election is over, and allow for the peaceful transfer of power. The losers are safe in the knowledge that they will neither lose their lives nor their liberty, and will continue to participate in public life. They are loyal not to the specific policies of the government, but to the fundamental legitimacy of the state and to the democratic process itself.  . 

==Origins==. 
{{Liberalism sidebar}}
Liberal democracy traces its origins—and its name—to the [[Europe]]an 18th century, also known as the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. At the time, the vast majority of European states were [[monarchy|monarchies]], with political power held either by the [[monarch]] or the [[aristocracy]]. The possibility of democracy had not been seriously considered by political theory since [[classical antiquity]], and the widely held belief was that democracies would be inherently unstable and chaotic in their policies due to the changing whims of the people. It was further believed that democracy was contrary to [[human nature]], as human beings were seen to be inherently evil, violent and in need of a strong leader to restrain their destructive impulses. Many European monarchs held that their power had been [[divine right of kings|ordained by God]], and that questioning their right to rule was tantamount to [[blasphemy]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} . 

These conventional views were challenged at first by a relatively small group of Enlightenment [[intellectual]]s, who believed that human affairs should be guided by [[reason]] and principles of liberty and equality. They argued that [[all people are created equal]], and therefore political authority cannot be justified on the basis of "noble blood", a supposed privileged connection to God, or any other characteristic that is alleged to make one person superior to others. They further argued that governments exist to serve the people, not vice versa, and that laws should apply to those who govern as well as to the governed (a concept known as [[rule of law]]).  . 

Near the end of the 18th century, these ideas inspired the [[American Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]], which gave birth to the ideology of [[liberalism]] and instituted forms of government that attempted to apply the principles of the Enlightenment philosophers into practice. Neither of these forms of government was precisely what we would call a liberal democracy we know today (the most significant difference being that voting rights were still restricted to a minority of the population), and the French attempt turned out to be short-lived, but they were the prototypes from which liberal democracy later grew. Since the supporters of these forms of government were known as liberals, the governments themselves came to be known as liberal democracies.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} . 

When the first prototypical liberal democracies were founded, the liberals themselves were viewed as an extreme and rather dangerous fringe group that threatened international peace and stability. The conservative [[monarchism|monarchists]] who opposed liberalism and democracy saw themselves as defenders of traditional values and the natural order of things, and their criticism of democracy seemed vindicated when [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] took control of the young [[French First Republic|French Republic]], reorganized it into the [[first French Empire]] and proceeded to conquer most of Europe. Napoleon was eventually defeated and the [[Holy Alliance]] was formed in Europe to prevent any further spread of liberalism or democracy. However, liberal democratic ideals soon became widespread among the general population, and, over the 19th century, traditional monarchy was forced on a continuous defensive and withdrawal.  . 

The [[dominion]]s of the [[British Empire]] became laboratories for liberal democracy from the mid 19th century onward. In Canada, responsible government began in the 1840s and in Australia and New Zealand, parliamentary government elected by [[male suffrage]] and [[secret ballot]] was established from the 1850s and [[female suffrage]] achieved from the 1890s. <ref>Geoffrey Blainey; A Very Short History of the World; Penguin Books; 2004; ISBN 978-0-14-300559-9</ref> . 

Reforms and revolutions helped move most European countries towards liberal democracy. Liberalism ceased being a fringe opinion and joined the political mainstream. At the same time, a number of non-liberal ideologies developed that took the concept of liberal democracy and made it their own. The political spectrum changed; traditional monarchy became more and more a fringe view and liberal democracy became more and more mainstream. By the end of the 19th century, liberal democracy was no longer only a "liberal" idea, but an idea supported by many different ideologies. After [[World War I]] and especially after [[World War II]], liberal democracy achieved a dominant position among theories of government and is now endorsed by the vast majority of the political spectrum.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} . 

Although liberal democracy was originally put forward by Enlightenment liberals, the relationship between democracy and liberalism has been controversial since the beginning.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} The ideology of liberalism—particularly in its [[classical liberalism|classical]] form—is highly [[individualism|individualistic]] and concerns itself with limiting the power of the state over the individual. In contrast, [[democracy]] is seen by some{{Who|date=January 2008}} as a [[collectivism|collectivist]] ideal, concerned with empowering the masses. Thus, liberal democracy may be seen as a compromise between liberal individualism and democratic collectivism. Those{{Who|date=January 2008}} who hold this view sometimes point to the existence of [[illiberal democracy]] and [[liberal autocracy]] as evidence that constitutional liberalism and democratic government are not necessarily interconnected.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} On the other hand, there is the view that constitutional liberalism and democratic government are not only compatible but necessary for the true existence of each other,{{Who|date=January 2008}}{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} both arising from the underlying concept of political equality. The research institute [[Freedom House]] today simply defines liberal democracy as an electoral democracy also protecting [[civil liberties]].  .

Several organisations and political scientists maintain lists of free and unfree states, both in the present and going back a couple centuries.

[[Freedom House]] considers many of the officially democratic governments in Africa and the former Soviet Union to be undemocratic in practice, usually because the sitting government has a strong influence over election outcomes. Many of these countries are in a state of considerable flux.  . 

Officially non-democratic forms of government, such as single-party states and dictatorships are more common in East Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa.  . 

==Types==. 
===Proportional vs. plurality representation===. 
[[Plurality voting system]] award seats according to regional majorities. The political party or individual candidate who receives the most votes, wins the seat which represents that locality. There are other democratic electoral systems, such as the various forms of [[proportional representation]], which award seats according to the proportion of individual votes that a party receives nation-wide or in a particular region.  . 

One of the main points of contention between these two systems, is whether to have representatives who are able to effectively represent specific regions in a country, or to have all citizens' vote count the same, regardless of where in the country they happen to live.  . 

Some countries such as [[Germany]] and [[New Zealand]], address the conflict between these two forms of representation, by having two categories of seats in the lower house of their national legislative bodies. The first category of seats is appointed according to regional popularity, and the remainder are awarded to give the parties a proportion of seats that is equal—or as equal as practicable—to their proportion of nation-wide votes. This system is commonly called [[mixed member proportional representation]].  . 

[[Australia]] incorporates both systems in having the [[preferential voting]] system applicable to the [[Australian House of Representatives|lower house]] and [[proportional representation]] by state in the [[Australian Senate|upper house]]. This system is argued to result in a more stable government, while having a better diversity of parties to review its actions.  . 

===Presidential vs. parliamentary systems===. 
A [[presidential system]] is a [[system of government]] of a [[republic]] in which the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] is elected separately from the [[legislature|legislative]]. A [[parliamentary system]] is distinguished by the [[executive branch of government]] being dependent on the direct or indirect support of the [[parliament]], often expressed through a [[vote of confidence]].  . 

The presidential system of democratic government has become popular in Latin America, Africa, and parts of the former Soviet Union, largely by the example of the United States. Constitutional monarchies (dominated by elected parliaments) are popular in Northern Europe and some former colonies which peacefully separated, such as Australia and Canada. Others have also arisen in Spain, East Asia, and a variety of small nations around the world. Former British territories such as South Africa, India, Ireland, and the United States opted for different forms at the time of independence. The parliamentary system is popular in the [[European Union]] and neighboring countries.  . 

==Issues and criticism==. 
===Lacking direct democracy===. 
Liberal democracies (also see [[representative democracy]]) do not respect will of the [[majority rule|majority]] except when electing representatives. This effectively means that a small number of elected representatives make decisions and policies about how a nation is governed, the laws that govern the lives of its citizens, and so on. In addition to the electoral process, the will of the majority is also restricted by the [[constitution]] or [[precedent]] decided by previous generations. The real power is actually held by a relatively small representative body and also minority interests. Thus, some argue that liberal democracy is merely a decoration over an [[oligarchy]], a [[plutocracy]], or a [[plutarchy]]; political theorist, [[Robert A. Dahl]], has described liberal democracies as [[Polyarchy|polyarchies]]. For these reasons and others, opponents support other, more direct forms of governance such as [[direct democracy]], or [[Consensus decision-making|consensus]].  . 

It has generally been argued by those who support liberal democracy or [[representative democracy]] that minority interests and individual liberties must be protected from the majority; for instance in [[Federalist No. 10]] [[James Madison]] states, "the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society". In order to prevent a minority, in this case, land owners, from being marginalized by a majority, in this case non-land owners, it prescribes what it calls a republic. Unmoderated majority rule could, in this view, lead to an oppression of minorities (see [[Majoritarianism]] below.) Another argument is that the elected leaders may be more interested and able than the average voter. A third is that it takes much effort and time if everyone should gather information, discuss, and vote on most issues. Direct democracy proponents in turn have counter-arguments, see the [[Direct democracy]]. [[Switzerland]] is a functioning example of direct democracy.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} . 

Many democracies have elements of [[direct democracy]] such as [[referendum]]s, [[plebiscite]], and models of "[[Deliberative democracy]]". For example, [[Venezuela]]n president [[Hugo Chávez]] has recently allowed referendums on important aspects of the government. Also, several states in the [[United States]] have functional aspects that are directly democratic. [[Uruguay]] is another example. Many other countries have referendums to a lesser degree in their political system.  . 

====Dictatorship of the Bourgeoisie====. 
Some [[Marxism|Marxists]], [[socialism|socialists]] and left-wing [[Anarchism|anarchists]], argue that liberal democracy is an integral part of the [[Capitalism|capitalist system]], is [[Social class|class]]-based and not democratic or [[Participatory democracy|participatory]]. It is [[bourgeois]] democracy because ultimately politicians fight only for the rights of the bourgeoisie. According to Marx, representation of the interests of different groups is proportional to the amount of money they are able to spend on financing the campaigns of nominees during elections, and is also proportional to their financial ability to lobby during a political term. For this reason in decision-making the public interest is distorted according to the weight of the wealth of the represented groups and individuals. Because of this multi-party democracy under a capitalist system is seen as distorted and undemocratic, operating in a way that facilitates the interest of the wealthy owners of the means of production, whose interest according to Marx is to be obligated to share less of their fortune and economic power with their employees, which means their interest is the exploitation of the lower-class. According to Marx, parliamentary elections are an opportunity citizens of a country get every few years to decide who among the [[ruling classes]] will misrepresent them in parliament. <ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch05.htm Karl Marx. The civil war in France]</ref> . 

The cost of political campaigning in representative democracies favors the rich, a form of [[plutocracy]] who are a very small minority of the voters.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} In Athenian democracy, some public offices were [[random]]ly allocated to citizens, in order to inhibit the effects of plutocracy. Aristotle described the law courts in Athens which were selected by lot as democratic<ref>Aristotle, Politics 2.1273b</ref> and described elections as oligarchic. <ref>Aristotle, Politics 4.1294b</ref> . 

Liberal democracy has also been attacked by some [[Democratic socialism|socialists]] as a dishonest farce used to keep the masses from realizing that their will is irrelevant in the political process, while at the same time a [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] for making them restless for some political agenda. Some contend that it encourages candidates to make deals with wealthy supporters, offering favorable legislation if the candidate is elected—perpetuating [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracies]] for [[monopoly|monopolization]] of key areas. [[Campaign finance reform]] is an attempt to correct this perceived problem. In response to these claims, United States economist [[Steven Levitt]] argues in his book [[Freakonomics]] that campaign spending is no guarantee of electoral success. He compared electoral success of the same pair of candidates running against one another repeatedly for the same job, as often happens in United States Congressional elections, where spending levels varied. He concludes: . 

:"A winning candidate can cut his spending in half and lose only 1 percent of the vote. Meanwhile, a losing candidate who doubles his spending can expect to shift the vote in his favor by only that same 1 percent."<ref>{{Cite book

===Media===. 
Critics of the role of the media in liberal democracies allege that [[concentration of media ownership]] leads to major distortions of democratic processes. In ''[[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media]]'', [[Edward S. Herman]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] argue, via their [[Propaganda Model]]<ref>Edward S. Herman [http://www.chomsky.info/onchomsky/199607--.htm "The Propaganda Model Revisited"], ''Monthly Review'', July 1996, as reproduced on the Chomsky.info website</ref> that the corporate media limits the availability of contesting views, and assert this creates a narrow spectrum of elite opinion. This is a natural consequence, they say, of the close ties between powerful [[corporation]]s and the media and not due to any explicit conspiracy. Systemic bias shapes the content of the media outlets to correspond with corporate interests. <ref>Noam Chomsky [http://www.chomsky.info/articles/199710--.htm "What Makes Mainstream Media Mainstream"], ''Z magazine'', October 1997, as reproduced on the Chomsky.info website</ref> In this view, although freedom of speech is secured and protected by the state, only those that adhere to that limited spectrum of opinion are granted significant and consistent access to the major media outlets. <ref>David Barsamian and Omar Khan [http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/6814 "Media Censorship"], Znet, 24 February 2005</ref><ref>[http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0624-25.htm Peter Phillips. Big Media Interlocks with Corporate America.]</ref><ref>David Cromwell [http://www.medialens.org/articles/the_articles/articles_2001/unholy_trinity.html "An Unholy Trinity: Truth, Market Forces and the Media"], Znet, 25 December 2000, as reproduced on the Media Lens website</ref> According to James Curran and [[Jean Seaton]], "contemporary political forces" are not simply represented by the press and broadcasting, but opinions are dependent on the ability to spread information to large numbers of people which is restricted to those who can afford it. <ref>James Curran and Jean Seaton ''Power Without Responsibility: the Press and Broadcasting in Britain'', London: Routledge, 1997, p.1</ref> . 

Media commentators also point out that the influential early champions of the media industry held fundamentally anti-democratic views, opposing the general population's involvement in creating policy. <ref>Noam Chomsky and Gabor Steingart[http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20081010.htm "The United States Has Essentially a One-Party System"], ''Der Spiegel Online'', 10 October 2008, as reproduced on the Chomsky.info website</ref> [[Walter Lippmann]] writing in ''[[The Phantom Public]]'' (1925), sought to "put the public in its place" so that those in power would be "free of the trampling and roar of a bewildered herd,"<ref>Lippmann cited by Henry Beissel [http://thehumananimal.com/usa/?p=381 "Mutation or Demise: The Democratization of Democracy"] ''Living with Democracy'', #155, Winter 2005, as reproduced on the ''Humanist Persrpectives'' website</ref> while [[Edward Bernays]], originator of public relations, sought to "regiment the public mind every bit as much as an army regiments their bodies."<ref>[http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/bernprop.html Propaganda by Edward Bernays (1928)]. Historyisaweapon.com. Retrieved on 2010-09-29. </ref>  . 

Defenders responding to such arguments assert that constitutionally protected [[freedom of speech]] makes it possible for both for-profit and non-profit organizations to debate the issues. They argue that media coverage in democracies simply reflects public preferences, and does not entail censorship. Especially with new forms of media such as the Internet, it is not expensive to reach a wide audience, if there is an interest for the ideas presented.  . 

===Limited voter turnout===. 
{{Details|Voter turnout}}
Low voter turnout, whether the cause is disenchantment, indifference or contentment with the status quo, may be seen as a problem, especially if disproportionate in particular segments of the population. Although turnout levels vary greatly among modern democratic countries, and in various types and levels of elections within countries, at some point low turnout may prompt questions as to whether the results reflect the will of the people, whether the causes may be indicative of concerns to the society in question, or in extreme cases the [[Legitimacy (political science)|legitimacy]] of the electoral system.  . 

[[Get out the vote]] campaigns, either by governments or private groups, may increase voter turnout, but distinctions must be made{{why|date=October 2011}} between general campaigns to raise the turnout rate and partisan efforts to aid a particular candidate, party or cause.  . 

Several nations have forms of [[compulsory voting]], with various degrees of enforcement. Proponents argue that this increases the legitimacy, and thus also popular acceptance, of the elections and ensures political participation by all those affected by the political process, and reduces the costs associated with encouraging voting. Arguments against include restriction of freedom, economic costs of enforcement, increased number of invalid and blank votes, and random voting. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idea.int/vt/compulsory_voting.cfm |title=International IDEA &#124; Compulsory Voting |publisher=Idea.int |date= |accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref> . 

Other alternatives include increased use of [[absentee ballots]], or other measures to ease or improve the ability to vote, including [[Electronic voting]].  . 

===Ethnic and religious conflicts===. 
For historical reasons, many states are not culturally and ethnically homogeneous. There may be sharp ethnic, linguistic, religious and cultural divisions. In fact, some groups may be actively hostile to each other. A democracy, which by definition allows mass participation in decision-making theoretically also allows the use of the political process against 'enemy' groups.  . 

The collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and the partial [[democratisation]] of Soviet bloc states was followed by wars and [[civil war]] in the former [[Yugoslavia]], in the [[Caucasus]], and in [[Moldova]]. Nevertheless, statistical research shows that the fall of [[Communism]] and the increase in the number of democratic states were accompanied by a sudden and dramatic decline in total warfare, interstate wars, [[ethnic]] wars, [[revolutionary]] wars, and the number of [[refugees]] and displaced people (worldwide, not in the countries of the former sovietic bloc). This trend, however, can be attributed to the end of cold war and the natural exhaustion of said conflicts, many of which were fueled by the USA and the USSR<ref>Peace and Conflict 2005: A Global Survey of Armed Conflicts, Self-Determination Movements, and Democracy. Monty G. Marshall and Ted Robert Gurr. [http://web.archive.org/web/20070206010818/http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/peace_and_conflict.asp] For illustrating graphs, see Center for Systemic Peace, (2006).

In her book [[World on Fire]], [[Yale Law School]] professor [[Amy Chua]] posits that "when free market democracy is pursued in the presence of a market-dominant minority, the almost invariable result is backlash. This backlash typically takes one of three forms. The first is a backlash against markets, targeting the market-dominant minority's wealth. The second is a backlash against democracy by forces favorable to the market-dominant minority. The third is violence, sometimes genocidal, directed against the market-dominant minority itself.". <ref>{{Cite book|last=Chua |first=Amy |authorlink=Amy Chua |title=[[World on Fire]] |publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|]] |year= 2002 |isbn=0385503024}}</ref> . 

===Bureaucracy===. 
A persistent [[libertarianism|libertarian]] and [[monarchism|monarchist]] critique of democracy is the claim that it encourages the elected representatives to change the law without necessity, and in particular to pour forth a flood of new laws. This is seen as pernicious in several ways. New laws constrict the scope of what were previously private liberties. Rapidly changing laws make it difficult for a willing non-specialist to remain law-abiding. This may be an invitation for law-enforcement agencies to misuse power. The claimed continual complication of the law may be contrary to a claimed simple and eternal [[natural law]]—although there is no consensus on what this natural law is, even among advocates. Supporters of democracy point to the complex bureaucracy and regulations that has occurred in dictatorships, like many of the former Communist states.  . 

The bureaucracy in Liberal democracies is often criticized for a claimed slowness and complexity of their decision-making. The term "[[Red tape]]" is a synonym of slow bureaucratic functioning that hinders quick results in a liberal democracy.  . 

===Short-term focus===. 
Modern liberal democracies, by definition, allow for regular changes of government. That has led to a common criticism of their short-term focus. In four or five years the government will face a new election, and it must think of how it will win that election. That would encourage a preference for policies that will bring short term benefits to the electorate (or to self-interested politicians) before the next election, rather than unpopular policy with longer term benefits. This criticism assumes that it is possible to make long term predictions for a society, something [[Karl Popper]] has criticized as [[historicism]].  . 

Besides the regular review of governing entities, short-term focus in a democracy could also be the result of collective short-term thinking. For example, consider a campaign for policies aimed at reducing environmental damage while causing temporary increase in unemployment. However, this risk applies also to other political systems.  . 

[[Anarcho-capitalist]] [[Hans-Herman Hoppe]] explained short-termism of the democratic governments by the rational choice of currently ruling group to over exploit temporarily accessible resources, thus deriving maximal economic advantage to the members of this group. (He contrasted this with [[hereditary]] [[monarchy]], in which a monarch has an interest in preserving the long-term capital value of his property (i.e. the country he owns) counter-balancing his desire to extract immediate revenue. He argues that the historical record of levels of taxation in certain monarchies (5–8%) and certain liberal democracies (40–60%) seems to confirm this contention. <ref>''Democracy: The God That Failed'' (Transaction Publishers, 2001) Paperback (in English) ISBN 0-7658-0868-4</ref> On the other hand, in modern hereditary autocracy of North Korea the state controls the whole economy while many liberal democratic states score very high on rankings of [[economic freedom]].  . 

===Public choice theory===. 
[[Public choice theory]] is a branch of [[economics]] that studies the decision-making behavior of voters, politicians and government officials from the perspective of economic theory. One studied problem is that each voter has little influence and may therefore have a [[rational ignorance]] regarding political issues. This may allow [[advocacy group|special interest groups]] to gain [[subsidy|subsidies]] and regulations beneficial to them but harmful to society. However, special interest groups may be equally or more influential in nondemocracies.  . 

===Majoritarianism===. 
{{Main|Majoritarianism}} . 

The [[tyranny of the majority]] is the fear that a direct democratic government, reflecting the majority view, can take action that oppresses a particular minority; for instance a minority holding wealth, property ownership, or power (see [[Federalist No. 10]]). Theoretically, the majority is a majority of all citizens. If citizens are not compelled by law to vote it is usually a majority of those who choose to vote. If such of group constitutes a minority then it is possible that a minority could, in theory, oppress another minority in the name of the majority. However, such an argument could apply to both [[direct democracy]] or [[representative democracy]]. In comparison to a direct democracy where every citizen is forced to vote, under liberal democracies the wealth and power is usually concentrated in the hands of a small privileged class who have significant power over the political process (See [[inverted totalitarianism]]). It is argued by some that in representative democracies this minority makes the majority of the policies and potentially oppresses the minority or even the majority in the name of the majority (See [[Silent majority]]). Several de facto dictatorships also have compulsory, but not "free and fair", voting in order to try to increase the legitimacy of the regime.  . 

Possible examples of a minority being oppressed by or in the name of the majority:
*Those potentially subject to [[conscription]] are a minority possibly because of socioeconomic reasons. 
*The minority who are wealthy often use their money and influence to manipulate the political process against the interests of the rest of the population, who are the minority in terms of income and access. 
*Several European countries have introduced bans on personal religious symbols in state schools. Opponents see this as a violation of rights to freedom of religion. Supporters see it as following from the separation of state and religious activities. 
*Prohibition of [[pornography]] is typically determined by what the majority is prepared to accept. 
*[[recreational drug use|Recreational drug, caffeine, tobacco and alcohol use]] is too often [[War on Drugs|criminalized]] or otherwise suppressed by majorities, originally for racist, classist, religious or paternalistic motives. <ref name="repealing">{{cite book |title=Repealing National Prohibition |author=David E.

The hallucinogen in the cacti, which the Indians interpreted as putting them in communion with their God, rendered them, said the distraught missionaries, "Resistant to all our moral suasions".  The missionaries had recourse to the state legislature and cactus eating was forbidden.  Between the turn of the century and the First World War these laws were generalized to all states of the Union and to all substances, including alcohol.  The Americans adopted prohibition in response to a strong religious lobby for whom all intoxicants were direct competitors for the control over the minds of men.}}</ref>
*Society's treatment of [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] is also cited in this context. Homosexual acts were widely criminalised in democracies until several decades ago; in some democracies they still are, reflecting the religious or sexual mores of the majority. 
*The Athenian democracy and the early United States had [[slavery]]. 
*The majority often taxes the minority who are wealthy at [[progressive tax|progressively higher rates]], with the intention that the wealthy will incur a larger tax burden for social purposes. 
*In prosperous western representative democracies, the poor form a minority of the population, and may not have the power to use the state to initiate redistribution when a majority of the electorate opposes such designs. When the poor form a distinct [[underclass]], the majority may use the democratic process to, in effect, withdraw the protection of the [[State (polity)|state]]. 
*An often quoted example of the 'tyranny of the majority' is that [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power by legitimate democratic procedures. The [[Nazism|Nazi]] party gained the largest share of votes in the democratic [[Weimar republic]] in 1933. Some might consider this an example of "tyranny of a minority" since he never gained a majority vote, but it is common for a [[Plurality voting system|plurality]] to exercise power in democracies, so the rise of Hitler cannot be considered irrelevant. However, his regime's large-scale human rights violations took place after the democratic system had been abolished. Also, the Weimar constitution in an [[Enabling Law|"emergency" allowed dictatorial powers and suspension of the essentials of the constitution itself without any vote or election]].  . 

Proponents of democracy make a number of defenses concerning 'tyranny of the majority'. One is to argue that the presence of a [[constitution]] protecting the rights of all citizens in many democratic countries acts as a safeguard. Generally, changes in these constitutions require the agreement of a [[supermajority]] of the elected representatives, or require a judge and jury to agree that evidentiary and procedural standards have been fulfilled by the state, or two different votes by the representatives separated by an election, or, sometimes, a [[referendum]]. These requirements are often combined. The [[separation of powers]] into [[legislative branch]], [[executive branch]], [[judicial branch]] also makes it more difficult for a small majority to impose their will. This means a majority can still legitimately coerce a minority (which is still ethically questionable), but such a minority would be very small and, as a practical matter, it is harder to get a larger proportion of the people to agree to such actions.  . 

Another argument is that majorities and minorities can take a markedly different shape on different issues. People often agree with the majority view on some issues and agree with a minority view on other issues. One's view may also change. Thus, the members of a majority may limit oppression of a minority since they may well in the future themselves be in a minority.  . 

A third common argument is that, despite the risks, majority rule is preferable to other systems, and the tyranny of the majority is in any case an improvement on a tyranny of a minority. All the possible problems mentioned above can also occur in nondemocracies with the added problem that a minority can oppress the majority. Proponents of democracy argue that empirical statistical evidence strongly shows that more democracy leads to less internal violence and mass murder by the government. This is sometimes formulated as [[Rummel's Law]], which states that the less democratic freedom a people have, the more likely their rulers are to murder them.  . 

===Political stability===. 
One argument for democracy is that by creating a system where the public can remove administrations, without changing the legal basis for government, democracy aims at reducing political uncertainty and instability, and assuring citizens that however much they may disagree with present policies, they will be given a regular chance to change those who are in power, or change policies with which they disagree. This is preferable to a system where political change takes place through violence.  . 

Some think that political stability may be considered as excessive when the group in power remains the same for an extended period of time. On the other hand, this is more common in nondemocracies.  . 

One notable feature of liberal democracies is that their opponents (those groups who wish to abolish liberal democracy) rarely win elections. Advocates use this as an argument to support their view that liberal democracy is inherently stable and can usually only be overthrown by external force, while opponents argue that the system is inherently stacked against them despite its claims to impartiality. In the past, it was feared that democracy could be easily exploited by leaders with dictatorial aspirations, who could get themselves elected into power. However, the actual number of liberal democracies that have elected dictators into power is low. When it has occurred, it is usually after a major crisis have caused many people to doubt the system or in young/poorly functioning democracies. Some possible examples include [[Adolf Hitler]] during the [[Great Depression]] and [[Napoleon III]] who become first President of the young [[Second French Republic]] and later Emperor.  . 

===Effective response in wartime===. 
A liberal democracy, by definition, implies that power is not concentrated. One criticism is that this could be a disadvantage for a state in [[war]]time, when a fast and unified response is necessary. The legislature usually must give consent before the start of an offensive military operation, although sometimes the executive can do this on its own while keeping the legislature informed. If the democracy is attacked, then no consent is usually required for defensive operations. The people may vote against a [[conscription]] army.  . 

However, actual research shows that democracies are more likely to win wars than non-democracies. One explanation attributes this primarily to "the transparency of the [[polity|polities]], and the stability of their preferences, once determined, democracies are better able to cooperate with their partners in the conduct of wars". Other research attributes this to superior mobilization of resources or selection of wars that the democratic states have a high chance of winning. <ref>Ajin Choi, (2004). "Democratic Synergy and Victory in War, 1816–1992". ''International Studies Quarterly'', Volume 48, Number 3, September 2004, pp. 663–682(20). {{doi|10.1111/j.0020-8833.2004.00319.x}}</ref> . 

Stam and [[Dan Reiter|Reiter]] also note that the emphasis on individuality within democratic societies means that their soldiers fight with greater initiative and superior leadership. <ref>{{Cite book|first=Reiter |last=Dan |coauthors=Stam, Allan C. |year=2002 |title=Democracies at War |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-08948-5 |pages=64–70}}</ref> Officers in dictatorships are often selected for political loyalty rather than military ability. They may be exclusively selected from a small class or religious/ethnic group that support the regime. The leaders in nondemocracies may respond violently to any perceived criticisms or disobedience. This may make the soldiers and officers afraid to raise any objections or do anything without explicit authorisation. The lack of initiative may be particularly detrimental in modern warfare. Enemy soldiers may more easily surrender to democracies since they can expect comparatively good treatment. Nazi Germany killed almost 2/3 of the captured Soviet soldiers. 38% of the American soldiers captured by North Korea in the [[Korean War]] were killed.  . 

===Better information on and corrections of problems===. 
A democratic system may provide better information for policy decisions. Undesirable information may more easily be ignored in dictatorships, even if this undesirable or contrarian information provides early warning of problems. The democratic system also provides a way to replace inefficient leaders and policies. Thus, problems may continue longer and crises of all kinds may be more common in autocracies. <ref name=carnegiecouncil1>{{cite web|title=The Democracy Advantage: How Democracies Promote Prosperity and Peace |work=Carnegie Council |url=http://carnegiecouncil.org/viewMedia.php/prmTemplateID/9/prmID/5129 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060628061201/http://carnegiecouncil.org/viewMedia.php/prmTemplateID/9/prmID/5129 |archivedate=2006-06-28}}</ref> . 

===Corruption===. 
Research by the [[World Bank]] suggests that political institutions are extremely important in determining the prevalence of [[Political corruption|corruption]]: (long term) democracy, parliamentary systems, political stability, and freedom of the press are all associated with lower corruption. <ref>

===Terrorism===. 
Several studies{{Fact|date=September 2011}} have concluded that terrorism is most common in nations with intermediate [[political freedom]]; meaning countries transitioning from autocratic governance to democracy. Nations with strong autocratic governments and governments that allow for more political freedom experience less terrorism. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2004/11.04/05-terror.html |title=Harvard Gazette: Freedom squelches terrorist violence |publisher=News.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref> . 

===Economic growth and financial crises===. 
Statistically, more democracy correlates with a higher gross domestic product ([[GDP]]) per capita.  . 

However, there is disagreement regarding how much credit the democratic system can take for this. One observation is that democracy became widespread only after the [[industrial revolution]] and the introduction of [[capitalism]]. On the other hand, the industrial revolution started in England which was one of the most democratic nations for its time within its own borders. (But this democracy was very limited and did not apply to the colonies which contributed significantly to the wealth.) . 

Several statistical studies support the theory that more capitalism, measured for example with one the several [[Index of Economic Freedom|Indices of Economic Freedom]] which has been used in hundreds of studies by independent researchers,<ref>Free the World. [http://www.freetheworld.com/papers.html Published Work Using Economic Freedom of the World Research]. Retrieved February 19, 2006. </ref> increases [[economic growth]] and that this in turn increases general prosperity, reduces poverty, and causes [[democratization]]. This is a statistical tendency, and there are individual exceptions like [[Mali]], which is ranked as "Free" by [[Freedom House]] but is a [[Least Developed Country]], or [[Qatar]], which has arguably the highest GDP per capita in the world but has never been democratic. There are also other studies suggesting that more democracy increases economic freedom although a few find no or even a small negative effect. <ref>Nicclas Bergren, (2002).

[http://smye2002.univ-paris1.fr/program/paper/b5_lun.pdf "The Effects of Democracy on Different Categories of Economic Freedom"]. Retrieved February 19, 2006. </ref> One objection might be that nations like [[Sweden]] and [[Canada]] today score just below nations like [[Chile]] and [[Estonia]] on economic freedom but that Sweden and Canada today have a higher GDP per capita. However, this is a misunderstanding, the studies indicate effect on economic growth and thus that future GDP per capita will be higher with higher economic freedom. Also, according to the index, Sweden and Canada are among the world's most capitalist nations, due to factors such as strong [[rule of law]], strong [[property rights]], and few restrictions against [[free trade]]. Critics might argue that the Index of Economic Freedom and other methods used does not measure the degree of capitalism, preferring some other definition.  . 

Some argue that economic growth due to its empowerment of citizens, will ensure a transition to democracy in countries such as Cuba. However, other dispute this. Even if economic growth has caused democratization in the past, it may not do so in the future. Dictators may now have learned how to have economic growth without this causing more political freedom. <ref>Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, George W. Downs, (2005).

''Foreign Affairs'', September/October 2004. </ref> . 

A high degree of oil or mineral exports is strongly associated with nondemocratic rule. This effect applies worldwide and not only to the Middle East. Dictators who have this form of wealth can spend more on their security apparatus and provide benefits which lessen public unrest. Also, such wealth is not followed by the social and cultural changes that may transform societies with ordinary economic growth. <ref>{{Cite journal|author=Ross, Michael Lewin |title=Does Oil Hinder Democracy? |journal=World Politics |year=2001 |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=325 &ndash;361 |doi=10.1353/wp.2001.0011}}</ref> . 

A recent meta-analysis finds that democracy has no direct effect on economic growth. However, it has a strong and significant indirect effects which contribute to growth. Democracy is associated with higher human capital accumulation, lower [[inflation]], lower political instability, and higher [[Index of Economic Freedom|economic freedom]]. There is also some evidence that it is associated with larger governments and more restrictions on international trade. <ref>{{Cite journal|author=Doucouliagos, H., Ulubasoglu, M |title=Democracy and Economic Growth: A meta-analysis |journal=School of Accounting, Economics and Finance Deakin University Australia |year=2006}}</ref> . 

If leaving out [[East Asia]], then during the last forty-five years poor democracies have grown their economies 50% more rapidly than nondemocracies. Poor democracies such as the Baltic countries, Botswana, Costa Rica, Ghana, and Senegal have grown more rapidly than nondemocracies such as Angola, Syria, Uzbekistan, and Zimbabwe. <ref name="carnegiecouncil1"/> . 

Of the eighty worst financial catastrophes during the last four decades, only five were in democracies. Similarly, poor democracies are half likely as nondemocracies to experience a 10 percent decline in GDP per capita over the course of a single year. <ref name="carnegiecouncil1"/> . 

===Famines and refugees===. 
A prominent economist, [[Amartya Sen]], has noted that no functioning democracy has ever suffered a large scale [[famine]]. <ref>[[Amartya Sen]], (1999). [http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/jod/10.3sen.html "Democracy as a Universal Value"]. ''Journal of Democracy'', 10.3, 3–17. Johns Hopkins University Press. </ref>
Refugee crises almost always occur in nondemocracies. Looking at the volume of refugee flows for the last twenty years, the first eighty-seven cases occurred in autocracies. <ref name=carnegiecouncil1/> . 

===Human development===. 
Democracy correlates with a higher score on the [[human development index]] and a lower score on the human poverty index.  . 

Democracies have the potential to put in place better education, longer life expectancy, lower infant mortality, access to drinking water, and better health care than dictatorships. This is not due to higher levels of foreign assistance or spending a larger percentage of [[GDP]] on health and education. Instead, the available resources are managed better. <ref name="carnegiecouncil1"/> . 

Several health indicators (life expectancy and infant and maternal mortality) have a stronger and more significant association with democracy than they have with [[GDP]] per capita, size of the public sector, or income inequality. <ref>{{Cite journal|author=Franco, Álvaro, Carlos Álvarez-Dardet and Maria Teresa Ruiz |title=Effect of democracy on health: ecological study (required) |journal=[[British Medical Journal]] |year=2004 |volume=329 |issue=7480 |pages=1421 &ndash;1423 |doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7480.1421 |pmid=15604165 |pmc=535957}}</ref> . 

In the post-Communist nations, after an initial decline, those that are the most democratic have achieved the greatest gains in life expectancy. <ref>{{Cite journal|author=McKee, Marin and Ellen Nolte |title=Lessons from health during the transition from communism |journal=[[British Medical Journal]] |year=2004 |volume=329 |issue=7480 |pages=1428 &ndash;1429 |doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7480.1428 |pmid=15604170 |pmc=535963}}</ref> . 

===Democratic peace theory===. 
{{Main|Democratic peace theory}} . 

Numerous studies using many different kinds of data, definitions, and statistical analyzes have found support for the democratic peace theory. The original finding was that liberal democracies have never made war with one another. More recent research has extended the theory and finds that democracies have few [[Militarized Interstate Disputes]] causing less than 1000 battle deaths with one another, that those MIDs that have occurred between democracies have caused few deaths, and that democracies have few [[civil wars]]. <ref>{{Cite journal|author=Hegre, Håvard, Tanja Ellington, Scott Gates, and Nils Petter Gleditsch |title=Towards A Democratic Civil Peace?

===Mass murder by government===.
