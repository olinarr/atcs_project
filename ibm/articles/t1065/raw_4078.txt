'''Robert Alan Dahl''' (born 17 December 1915, [[Inwood, Iowa]]), is the [[Sterling Professor]] emeritus of [[political science]] at [[Yale University]], where he earned his Ph.D. in political science in 1940. He is past president of the [[American Political Science Association]] and an honorary member of [[Manuscript Society]]. Dahl has often been described as "the Dean" of American political scientists.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} . 

==Writings== . 

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he was involved in a dispute with [[C. Wright Mills]] over the nature of [[politics in the United States]].  Mills held that America's governments are in the grasp of a unitary and demographically narrow power elite. Dahl responded that there are many different elites involved, who have to work both in contention and in compromise with one another. If this is not [[democracy]] in a [[populism|populist]] sense, Dahl contended, it is at least [[polyarchy]] (or [[pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]]). In perhaps his best known work, ''[[Who Governs?]]'' (1961), he examines the power structures (both formal and informal) in the city of [[New Haven, Connecticut]], as a case study, and finds that it supports this view.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}  . 

From the late 1960s onwards, his conclusions were challenged by scholars such as [[G. William Domhoff]] and [[Charles E. Lindblom]] (a friend and colleague of Dahl). {{citation needed|date=September 2011}} . 

In more recent years, Dahl's writings have taken on a more pessimistic tone. In ''[[How Democratic Is the American Constitution?]]'' (2001) he argued that the constitution is much less democratic than it ought to be given that its authors were operating from a position of "profound ignorance" about the future.  However, he adds that there is little or nothing that can be done about this "short of some constitutional breakdown, which I neither foresee nor, certainly, wish for." {{citation needed|date=September 2011}} . 

==Influence terms==. 
One of Robert Dahl’s many contributions is his explication of the varieties of power, which he defines as “A” getting “B” to do what “A” wants.  Dahl prefers the more neutral “influence terms,” (Michael G. Roskin) which he arrayed on a scale from best to worst: 
# ''Rational Persuasion,'' the nicest form of influence, means telling the truth and explaining why someone should do something, like your doctor convincing you to stop smoking. {{citation needed|date=September 2011}}
# ''Manipulative persuasion,'' a notch lower, means lying or misleading to get someone to do something. {{citation needed|date=September 2011}}
# ''Inducement'' still lower, means offering rewards or punishments to get someone to do something, i.e. like bribery.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}
# ''Power'' threatens severe punishment, such as jail or loss of job.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}
# ''Coercion'' is power with no way out; you have to do it.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}
# ''Physical force'' – is backing up coercion with use or threat of bodily harm.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} . 

Thus, we can tell which governments are best; the ones that use influence at the higher end of the scale.  The worst use the unpleasant forms of influence at the lower end. {{citation needed|date=September 2011}} . 

==Democracy and polyarchies==. 
::''See also main article on [[polyarchy]]''
In his book, ''[[Democracy and Its Critics]]'' (1989), Dahl clarifies his view about democracy. No modern country meets the ideal of democracy, which is as a theoretical utopia. To reach the ideal requires meeting five criteria:
# '''Effective participation'''<br />Citizens must have adequate and equal opportunities to form their preference and place questions on the public agenda and express reasons for one outcome over the other.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}
# '''Voting equality at the decisive stage'''<br />Each citizen must be assured his or her judgments will be counted as equal in weights to the judgments of others.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}
# '''Enlightened understanding'''<br />Citizens must enjoy ample and equal opportunities for discovering and affirming what choice would best serve their interests.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}
# '''Control of the agenda'''<br />Demos or people must have the opportunity to decide what political matters actually are and what should be brought up for deliberation.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}
# '''Inclusiveness'''<br />Equality must extend to all citizens within [[State (polity)|the state]]. Everyone has legitimate stake within the political process.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} . 

Instead, he calls politically advanced countries "polyarchies". Polyarchies have elected officials, free and fair elections, inclusive suffrage, rights to run for office, freedom of expression, alternative information and associational autonomy. Those institutions are a major advance in that they create multiple centers of political power.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} . 

== Prizes ==. 
Dahl was awarded the [[Johan Skytte Prize in Political Science]] in 1995. {{citation needed|date=September 2011}} .

* Sociologist [[G. William Domhoff]] strongly disagrees with Dahl's view of power in [[New Haven]], CT in the 1960s: [http://sociology.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/new_haven.html "Who Really Ruled in Dahl's New Haven?"] {{citation needed|date=September 2011}}
* Political philosopher [[Charles Blattberg]] has criticized Dahl's attempt to define democracy with a set of necessary and sufficient conditions. {{citation needed|date=September 2011}} .
