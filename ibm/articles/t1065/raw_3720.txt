[[Image:Engelbert Dollfuss.png|thumb|upright|[[Engelbert Dollfuss]]'s chancellorship in Austria contained many authoritarian elements.]]'''Authoritarianism''' is a form of [[social organization]] characterized by submission to [[authority]]. It is usually opposed to [[individualism]] and [[libertarianism]]. In [[politics]], an authoritarian government is one in which political authority is concentrated in a [[elite|small group]] of politicians. <ref>

==Characteristics==. 
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}
Authoritarianism is characterized by highly concentrated, and [[Centralized government|centralized]] power maintained by political repression and the exclusion of potential challengers. It uses [[Political party|political parties]] and mass organizations to mobilize people around the goals of the regime. <ref name="Vestal">"Vestal, Theodore M. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=XWXtXOl56KkC&c Ethiopia: A Post-Cold War African State]''. Greenwood, 1999, p. 17. </ref> . 

Authoritarianism emphasizes arbitrary law rather than the rule of law, it often includes [[Electoral fraud|election rigging]], political decisions being made by a select group of officials behind closed doors, a [[bureaucracy]] that sometimes operates independently of rules,{{dubious|date=April 2011}} which does not properly supervise elected officials, and fails to serve the concerns of the constituencies they purportedly serve. Authoritarianism also tends to embrace the informal and unregulated exercise of political power, a leadership that is "self-appointed and even if elected cannot be displaced by citizens' free choice among competitors," the arbitrary deprivation of [[civil liberties]], and little tolerance for meaningful [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]];<ref name="Vestal"/> . 

A range of social controls also attempt to stifle civil society, while political stability is maintained by control over and support of the [[military|armed forces]], a bureaucracy staffed by the regime, and creation of [[allegiance]] through various means of [[socialization]] and indoctrination. <ref name="Vestal"/> . 

Authoritarian political systems may be weakened through "inadequate performance to demands of the people."<ref name="Vestal"/> Vestal writes that the tendency to respond to challenges to authoritarianism through tighter control instead of [[adaptation]] is a significant weakness, and that this overly rigid approach fails to "adapt to changes or to accommodate growing demands on the part of the populace or even groups within the system."<ref name="Vestal"/> Because the [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the state is dependent on performance, authoritarian states that fail to adapt may collapse. <ref name="Vestal"/> . 

Authoritarianism is marked by "indefinite political tenure" of the ruler or [[ruling party]] (often in a [[single-party state]]) or other authority. <ref name="Vestal"/> The transition from an authoritarian system to a more [[Democracy|democratic]] form of government is referred to as [[democratization]]. <ref name="Vestal"/> . 

John Duckitt of the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] suggests a link between authoritarianism and [[collectivism]], asserting that both stand in opposition to [[individualism]]. <ref>{{cite doi|10.2307/3791588}}</ref>
Duckitt writes that both authoritarianism and collectivism submerge [[individual rights]] and goals to group goals, expectations and [[Conformity|conformities]]. <ref>{{cite doi|10.1177/0022022103034003005}}</ref>
Others argue that collectivism, properly defined, has a basis of [[consensus decision-making]], the opposite of authoritarianism.  . 

==Authoritarianism and totalitarianism==. 
[[Totalitarianism]] is an extreme version of authoritarianism. Authoritarianism primarily differs from totalitarianism in that social and economic institutions exist that are not under governmental control.  Building on the work of Yale political scientist Juan Linz, Paul C. Sondrol of the [[University of Colorado at Colorado Springs]] has examined the characteristics of authoritarian and totalitarian dictators and organized them in a chart:<ref name="Sondrol">{{cite doi|10.1017/S0022216X00015868}}</ref> .

Sondrol argues that while both authoritarianism and totalitarianism are forms of [[autocracy]], they differ in "key [[Dichotomy|dichotomies]]": . 

{{quote|(1) Unlike their bland and generally unpopular authoritarian brethren, totalitarian dictators develop a [[charisma]]tic '[[cult of personality|mystique]]' and a mass-based, pseudo-democratic [[interdependence]] with their followers via the conscious manipulation of a prophetic image. 
(2) [[wikt:Concomitant|Concomitant]] role conceptions differentiate totalitarians from authoritarians. Authoritarians view themselves as individual beings, largely content to control; and often maintain the status quo. Totalitarian self-conceptions are largely [[teleology|teleological]]. The [[tyrant]] is less a [[person]] than an indispensable 'function' to guide and reshape the universe.  . 

(3) Consequently, the utilisation of power for personal aggrandizement is more evident among authoritarians than totalitarians. Lacking the binding appeal of [[ideology]], authoritarians support their rule by a mixture of instilling fear and granting rewards to loyal collaborators, engendering a [[kleptocracy]]. <ref name="Sondrol"/>}} . 

Thus, compared to totalitarian systems, authoritarian systems may also leave a larger sphere for [[Private sphere|private life]], lack a guiding ideology, tolerate some [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]] in social organization, lack the power to mobilize the whole population in pursuit of national goals, and exercise their power within relatively predictable limits.  . 

==Authoritarianism and democracy==. 
Authoritarianism and democracy are not fundamentally opposed to one another, it is thus perfectly possible for democracies to possess strong authoritarian elements, for both feature a form of submission to authority. An [[illiberal democracy]] (or [[procedural democracy]]) is distinguished from [[liberal democracy]] (or [[substantive democracy]]) in that illiberal democracies lack the more democratic features of liberal democracies, such as the [[rule of law]], an [[Judicial independence|independent judiciary]], along with a further distinction that liberal democracies have rarely made war with one another. More recent research has extended the theory and finds that more democratic countries tend to have few [[Militarized Interstate Disputes]] causing less battle deaths with one another, and that democracies have few [[civil war]]s. <ref>

* Poor democracies tend to have better education, longer life expectancy, lower infant mortality, access to drinking water, and better health care than poor dictatorships. This is not due to higher levels of foreign assistance or spending a larger percentage of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] on health and education. Instead, the available resources are more likely to be managed better. <ref name = "shqzhz">{{cite web |title=The Democracy Advantage: How Democracies Promote Prosperity and Peace |work=Carnegie Council |url=http://carnegiecouncil.org/viewMedia.php/prmTemplateID/9/prmID/5129   }}{{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref> . 

* Studies suggest that several health indicators (life expectancy and infant and maternal mortality) have a stronger and more significant association with democracy than they have with [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita, size of the public sector, or income inequality. <ref>{{cite doi|10.1136/bmj.329.7480.1421}}</ref> . 

*A prominent economist, [[Amartya Sen]], has theorized that no functioning country labeled as having a liberal democracy has ever suffered a large-scale [[famine]]. <ref>{{cite doi|10.1353/jod.1999.0055}}</ref> This includes democracies that have not been very prosperous historically, like [[India]], which had its last great famine in 1943 and many other large-scale famines before that in the late nineteenth century, all under British rule. (However, some others ascribe the [[Bengal famine of 1943]] to the effects of [[World War II]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. The government of India had been becoming progressively more democratic for years. Provincial government had been entirely so since the [[Government of India Act 1935|Government of India Act of 1935]].) . 

* Refugee crises almost always occur in the least democratic countries. Looking at the volume of refugee flows for the last twenty years, the first eighty-seven cases occurred in most authoritarian countries. <ref name="shqzhz"/> . 

* Research shows that the democratic nations have much less [[democide]] or murder by government. However it should be noted that those were also moderately developed nations before applying liberal democratic policies. <ref>{{cite book |author=[[R. J.

* Research by the [[World Bank]] suggests that political institutions are extremely important in determining the prevalence of [[Political corruption|corruption]]: parliamentary systems, political stability, and freedom of the press are all associated with lower corruption. <ref>

* Of the eighty worst financial catastrophes during the last four decades, only five were in countries labeled as democracies.

* One study has concluded that terrorism is most common in nations with intermediate political freedom. The nations with the least amount of terrorism are the most and least democratic nations. <ref>{{cite web|author=Harvard News Office |url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2004/11.04/05-terror.html |title=Harvard Gazette: Freedom squelches terrorist violence |publisher=News.harvard.edu |date=2004-11-04 |accessdate=2012-02-02}}</ref> . 

==Authoritarian states==. 
Any list of such states is bound to be controversial; certain indices have striven to ascertain the openness or democratic quality of countries based on a somewhat simplistic tick-box method, the notion of index itself being economically oriented.  Within the present world system, unsurprisingly the "[[soft power]]" countries of major western power centers often come out at the top of such lists, countries such as [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], etc..  on the other hand, places like [[North Korea]], [[Chad]] and [[Turkmenistan]] appear as strongly authoritarian.  For a list see, for example, ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine's [[democracy index]], though this is a economic-liberal magazine - but indexes compiled from other points of view such as [[Amnesty International]] or [[Freedom House]] are available from time to time.  It is often the more wealthy countries that come out at the top of such lists and the poorer ones that fall toward the end; whether this is a cause or result of their political systems is open to debate.  . 

Another way of looking at the problem of trying to make a list of authoritarian regimes is not to compare the apparent forms of government (for example, whether direct election as in the Swiss [[Canton (country subdivision)|Cantons]] or by [[collegiate]] representation etc.) but, in making such a list, to compare the balance of power between the political elite and the general populace.  Such an index asks questions as to whether or not a given government allows the direct influence of its subjects in the decision making process, whether or not it suppresses [[Freedom of Speech]], imprisons them in [[Gulag]]s or other such [[prison]] systems or behaves in a belligerent manner towards more democratic nations or allows poor work conditions to flourish or even allows forms of [[slavery]].  . 

The government of China is generally considered to be a modern authoritarian government. China is ruled by one party only, known as the Communist Party.  Policies in China are created in high-level meetings, in which the general population has no input into the choices that are made for them. The government of China keeps watch over the Chinese internet meticulously, looking for anything that may be considered politically sensitive. They also block major social networking websites such as Facebook and Twitter, as they are concerned that citizens may use these sites to organize public demonstrations. Furthermore, some citizens who have posted information on the Internet that is pro-democratic have been harassed and are sometimes even imprisoned. <ref>[http://www.kansascity.com/2012/01/17/3376563/china-says-government-to-be-more.html ]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref>  Another measure that the government of China has taken which many argue infringes on the rights of its citizens is the enforcement of the one-child policy of 1979, which limits each couple who are ethnic Han Chinese living in urban areas to one child. While this was done for purposes of population control, it has led to the killing or abandonment of many female babies (so that the couple may instead have a son to carry on their family name). Also, there have been multiple consequences for parents who have more than one child, including fines, pressure to abort, and forced sterilization. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/od/populationgeography/a/onechild.htm |title=China One Child Policy - Overview of the One Child Policy in China |publisher=Geography.about.com |date=2006-05-17 |accessdate=2012-02-02}}</ref>  .

==Authoritarianism in history==. 
{{Expand section|date=July 2010}}
Many different forms of authoritarianism have served as the norm in many polities and in most periods from the dawn of recorded history. [[Tribal chief]]s and [[god-king]]s often gave way to despots and emperors, then to [[Enlightened absolutism|enlightened monarch]]s and juntas. Even superficially democratic constitutions or those claiming to be such can allow the concentration of power or domination by [[Strongman (politics)|strong-men]] or by small groups of political elites - note the history of the Icelandic [[Althing]].  . 

In contrast to the varying manifestations of authoritarianism, more democratic forms of governance as a standard mode of political organization became widespread only after the [[Industrial Revolution]] had established [[modernity]]. Tyrants and [[oligarchy|oligarch]]s bracketed the flourishing of democracy in [[Classical Athens|ancient Athens]]; and [[Kings of Rome|kings]] and [[Roman Emperor|emperor]]s preceded and followed experimentation with democratic forms in the [[Roman Republic]].  In the 15th century, [[Vlad Dracula]] is credited for being the first ruler of Wallachia and Transylvania to rule by Authoritarianism. <ref>Treptow, Kurt W. “Vlad III Dracula and his Relations with the Boyars and the Church.” East European Monographs, No. DXIX. Columbia University Press: New York, 1998. p.27-40</ref> .
