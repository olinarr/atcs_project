'''''The End of History and the Last Man''''' is a 1992 book by [[Francis Fukuyama]], expanding on his 1989 essay "The End of History?", published in the international affairs journal ''[[The National Interest]]''. In the book, Fukuyama argues that the advent of [[Western world|Western]] [[liberal democracy]] may signal the end point of humanity's [[sociocultural evolution]] and the final form of human government.  . 

:"What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the [[Cold War]], or the passing of a particular period of post-war history, but the end of history as such: that is, the end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western [[liberal democracy]] as the final form of human government."<ref>The End of History and the Last Man. (Fukuyama, 1992.)</ref> . 

Fukuyama's position contradicts that of [[Karl Marx]], who imagined that antagonistic history would end with [[communism]] displacing [[capitalism]]. <ref>"This social formation constitutes, therefore, the closing chapter of the prehistoric stage of human society." [[q:Karl_Marx#preface|Preface to 'A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy']] (1859)</ref> Fukuyama himself identifies on some level with Marx, but identifies most strongly with the German philosopher [[Hegel]], by way of [[Alexandre Kojève]]. Kojeve argued that the progress of history must lead toward the establishment of a "universal and homogenous" state,<ref>Strauss's term, from the Strauss-Kojeve correspendence, published in [[Leo Strauss]], ''On Tyranny'' (University of Chicago Press, 1961)</ref> most likely incorporating elements of liberal or social democracy; but Kojeve's emphasis on the necessarily "post-political" character of such a state (and its citizens) makes such comparisons inadequate, and is irreducible to any mere "triumph" of capitalism. <ref>Alexandre Kojeve, ''Introduction to the Reading of Hegel: Lectures on the'' Phenomenology of Spirit, (Basic Books, 1969), "Note to the Second Edition," p. 159. </ref> It is conjectured that Fukuyama learned of Kojève through his teacher [[Allan Bloom]].  . 

== Highlights ==. 
* History should be viewed as an evolutionary process
* Events still occur at the end of history
* Pessimism about man's future is warranted because of man's inability to control technology
* The end of history means liberal democracy will become the only form of government for all States. This form of government will be the last form of government.  . 

===Misinterpretations===. 
According to Fukuyama, since the [[French Revolution]], democracy has repeatedly proven to be a fundamentally better system (ethically, politically, economically) than any of the alternatives.  . 

The most basic (and prevalent) error in discussing Fukuyama's work is to confuse 'history' with 'events'. Fukuyama does not claim at any point that events will stop happening in the future. What he is claiming is that all that will happen in the future (even if [[totalitarianism]] returns) is that democracy will become more and more prevalent in the ''long'' term, although it may have 'temporary' setbacks (which may, of course, last for centuries).  . 

*Some argue{{who|date=December 2010}} that Fukuyama presents 'American-style' democracy as the only 'correct' political system and that all countries must inevitably follow this particular government system; however, many Fukuyama scholars claim this is a misreading of his work.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Fukuyama's argument is only that in the future there will be more and more governments that use the framework of [[parliamentary democracy]] and that contain markets of some sort. Indeed, Fukuyama has stated:
::"''The End of History'' was never linked to a specifically American model of social or political organization. Following Alexandre Kojève, the [[Russian people|Russian]]-[[French people|French]] philosopher who inspired my original argument, I believe that the [[European Union]] more accurately reflects what the world will look like at the end of history than the contemporary United States. The EU's attempt to transcend sovereignty and traditional power politics by establishing a transnational [[rule of law]] is much more in line with a "post-historical" world than the Americans' continuing belief in [[God]], [[national sovereignty]], and their military."<ref>Francis Fukuyama. (2007-04-03).  [http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/francis_fukuyama/2007/04/the_history_at_the_end_of_hist.html The history at the end of history.] [[The Guardian]]. Retrieved 2008-06-18</ref> . 

==Arguments in favor==. 
[[File:Freedom in the world.svg|thumb|350px|This graph shows the number of nations in the different categories given by [[Freedom House]] in their survey [[Freedom in the World 2006|Freedom in the World]] for the period for which there are surveys, 1972-2005. Nations are categorized as "Free", "Partly Free", and "Not Free". Freedom House considers "Free" nations to be liberal democracies. The trend is much weaker when [http://www.freedomhouse.org/images/File/PopulationmTrendsFIW1980-2009.pdf counting population instead], as countries classified as "free" tend to be smaller and have lower population growth.]] . 

* One argument used to support the theory is the dramatic rise in democratic nations over the course of the 20th century. An extensive study by [[Freedom House]] in 2003 counted zero liberal democracies with universal [[suffrage]] in the world in 1900 but 119 (60 percent) at the time. They counted 25 (19 percent) nations with 'restricted democratic practices' in 1900 and 16 (8%) today. Additionally, they counted 19 (14 percent) [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]] in 1900, where a constitution limited the powers of the monarch, and with some power devolved to elected legislatures, and none today. Other nations had, and have, various forms of non-democratic rule. <ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20050307102714/http://www.freedomhouse.org/reports/century.html Democracy's Century: A Survey of Global Political Change in the 20th Century]. Freedom House, Inc. (2003). Retrieved 2008-06-18. </ref>
* Another argument in favor of Fukuyama's thesis is the [[democratic peace theory]], which argues that mature democracies rarely or never go to war with one another. This theory has faced [[democratic peace theory#Criticism|criticism]], with arguments largely resting on conflicting definitions of "war" and "mature democracy". Part of the difficulty in assessing the theory is that democracy as a widespread global phenomenon emerged only very recently in human history, which makes generalizing about it difficult. (See also [[list of wars between democracies]]). 
* Other major empirical evidence includes the elimination of inter-state warfare in South America, Southeast Asia, and Eastern Europe among countries that moved from military dictatorships to liberal democracies. 
* According to several studies, the end of the Cold War and the subsequent increase in the number of [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] states were accompanied by a sudden and dramatic decline in total [[war]]fare, interstate wars, [[ethnic]] wars, [[revolutionary]] wars, and the number of [[refugees]] and [[displaced person]]s. <ref>[http://members.aol.com/CSPmgm/conflict.htm Global Conflict Trends.] Center for Systemic Peace.

==Criticisms== . 

There have been many criticisms of the "end of history" thesis.  . 

===Critics of liberal democracy===. 
Some have argued against the book due to an ideological disagreement with the concept of liberal democracy.  . 

*[[Jacques Derrida]] criticized Fukuyama in ''[[Specters of Marx]]'' (1993) as a "come-lately reader" of [[Alexandre Kojève]] "in the tradition of [[Leo Strauss]]," who already described U.S. society in the 1950s as the "realization of communism." According to Derrida, Fukuyama &mdash; and the quick celebrity of his book &mdash; is but one symptom of the anxiety to ensure the "death of Marx." Fukuyama's celebration of [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[hegemony]] is criticized by Derrida: . 

{{cquote|For it must be cried out, at a time when some have the audacity to neo-evangelize in the name of the ideal of a liberal democracy that has finally realized itself as the ideal of human history: never have violence, inequality, exclusion, [[famine]], and thus economic oppression affected as many human beings in the history of the earth and of humanity. Instead of singing the advent of the ideal of liberal democracy and of the [[capitalism|capitalist]] market in the euphoria of the end of history, instead of celebrating the ‘end of ideologies’ and the end of the great emancipatory discourses, let us never neglect this obvious macroscopic fact, made up of innumerable singular sites of suffering: no degree of progress allows one to ignore that never before, in absolute figures, have so many men, women and children been subjugated, starved or exterminated on the earth. <ref name="Specters of Marx">Derrida, 1994. </ref>}} . 

:Derrida goes on to analyze Fukuyama's book as taking part in the intellectual branch of current Western Hegemony and the spreading of its "New Gospel": "This end of History is essentially a [[Christian eschatology]]. It is consonant with the current discourse of the Pope on the European community: destined to become a Christian State or Super-State, this community would still belong therefore to some Holy Alliance." He claims that the book uses a 'sleight-of-hand trick' of making use of empirical data whenever it seems to suit its message, while appealing to an ideal whenever the empirical data contradicts it. Derrida points out that Fukuyama himself sees the real states of the United States and the European Union as imperfect compared to the "ideals" of Liberal Democracy and Free Market.  Even the author understands that such final Ideals are not demonstrated by empirical evidence or ever could be demonstrated empirically.  They belong entirely to the realm of philosophy or religion, owing their birth to the Gospels of Philosophy of [[Hegel]].  And yet Fukuyama still uses a movement toward empirical observations, which he himself grants are imperfect and incomplete, to validate an idea which is purely idealistic and transcendent of any empirical reality or possibility. <ref name="Specters of Marx"/> . 

*''Environmentalism''. Some [[Environmentalism|environmentalists]] have argued that relentless growth will conflict with and overwhelm the Earth's scarce resources, and that Fukuyama's thesis does not address issues concerning the potential scarcity of water, scarcity of fuel and other environmental issues such as [[climate change]].  . 

*''Marxism''. Certain versions of Marxism can be conceived as "end of history" philosophies. Therefore Marxists like [[Perry Anderson]] have been among Fukuyama's fiercest critics. Apart from pointing out that capitalist democracies are still riven with poverty, racial tension etc., Marxists also reject Fukuyama's reliance on Hegel. According to them, Hegel's philosophy was fatally flawed until Marx 'turned it on its head' to create [[historical materialism]]. Fukuyama argues that even though there is poverty, [[racism]] and [[sexism]] in present-day democracies, there is no sign of a major revolutionary movement developing that would actually overthrow capitalism. While Marxists disagree with Fukuyama's claim that ''capitalist'' democracy represents the end of history, they support the idea that the "end of history" will consist of the victory of democracy: [[communism]], in the Marxist view, must necessarily involve a form of [[direct democracy]].  . 

*''Anarcho-capitalism''. Some [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] (such as [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]]) argue that democracy failed the [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition by subordinating [[individual rights]] (especially [[private property]]) to the public interest, and that democracy is actually a decline of civilization compared to monarchy (see ''[[Democracy: The God That Failed]]'').  . 

*[[President of Venezuela|Venezuelan President]] [[Hugo Chávez]] has argued against "the end of history": he argued his case in his September 2006 address to the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. <ref>[http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0920-22.htm Text of Hugo Chávez's address to the United Nations General Assembly, September 2006]</ref> As recently as August 2006, Fukuyama has written in response to Chávez's argument, his main point being that Chavismo is only possible due to the unique [[oil]] reserves of [[Venezuela]], and thus will not spread. <ref>Francis Fukuyama. (2006-08-06). [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/04/AR2006080401768.html "History's Against Him"]. [[The Washington Post]]. Retrieved 2008-06-18. </ref> . 

===Radical Islam, tribalism and the "Clash of Civilizations"===. 
Various Western commentators have described the thesis of ''The End of History'' as flawed because it does not sufficiently take into account the power of ethnic loyalties and religious fundamentalism as a counter-force to the spread of liberal democracy; with the specific example of [[Islamic fundamentalism]], or radical Islam, as the most powerful of these.  . 

[[Benjamin Barber]] wrote a 1992 article and 1995 book, ''[[Jihad vs. McWorld]]'', that addressed this theme. Barber described "[[McWorld]]" as a secular, liberal, corporate-friendly transformation of the world, and used the word "[[jihad]]" to refer to the competing forces of tribalism and religious fundamentalism, with a special emphasis on Islamic fundamentalism.  . 

[[Samuel P. Huntington]] wrote a 1993 essay, "[[The Clash of Civilizations]]", in direct response to ''The End of History''; he then expanded the essay into a 1996 book, ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order''. In the essay and book, Huntington argued that the temporary conflict between ideologies is being replaced by the ancient conflict between civilizations. The dominant civilization decides the form of human government, and these will not be constant. He especially singled out Islam, which he described as having "bloody borders".  . 

After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], in which a group of terrorists, masterminded by [[Osama bin Laden]], hijacked airplanes and flew them into various targets in the United States, ''The End of History'' was cited by some commentators as a symbol of the supposed naivete and undue optimism of the Western world during the 1990s, in thinking that the end of the [[Cold War]] also represented the end of major global conflict. In the weeks after the attacks, [[Fareed Zakaria]] called the events "the end of the end of history", while [[George Will]] wrote that history had "returned from vacation". <ref name="history is still">[http://englishmatters.gmu.edu/issue6/911exhibit/emails/fukuyama_wsj.htm History Is Still Going Our Way], Francis Fukuyama, ''The Wall Street Journal'', October 5, 2001</ref> . 

Fukuyama did discuss radical Islam briefly in ''The End of History''. He argued that [[Islam]] is not an [[Imperialist]] force like Stalinism and Fascism: i.e. that it has little intellectual or emotional appeal outside the Islamic 'heartlands'. Fukuyama pointed to the economic and political difficulties that [[Iran]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] face, and argued that such states are fundamentally unstable: either they will become democracies with a Muslim society (like [[Turkey]]) or they will simply disintegrate. Moreover, when [[Islamic state]]s have actually been created, they were easily dominated by the powerful Western states.  . 

In October 2001, Fukuyama, in a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' opinion piece, responded to the declarations that the September 11 attacks had disproved his views by stating that "time and resources are on the side of modernity, and I see no lack of a will to prevail in the United States today." He also noted that his original thesis "does not imply a world free from conflict, nor the disappearance of culture as a distinguishing characteristic of societies."<ref name="history is still" /> . 

In a 2008 ''[[Washington Post]]'' opinion piece, Fukuyama wrote:
<blockquote>
Democracy's only real competitor in the realm of ideas today is radical [[Islamism]]. Indeed, one of the world's most dangerous nation-states today is Iran, run by extremist Shiite mullahs. But as [[Peter Bergen]] pointed out in these pages last week, Sunni radicalism has been remarkably ineffective in actually taking control of a nation-state, due to its propensity to devour its own potential supporters. Some disenfranchised Muslims thrill to the rantings of Osama bin Laden or Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], but the appeal of this kind of medieval Islamism is strictly limited. <ref name="they can only">[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/22/AR2008082202395.html They Can Only Go So Far], Francis Fukuyama, ''The Washington Post'', August 24, 2008</ref>
</blockquote> . 

===Recalcitrant Interdependence=== . 

Robert Potter criticized "the End of History". In his thesis [[Recalcitrant Interdependence]], he reasoned that even if an idea is objectively better than the other possible alternatives, states are still free to ignore it. In [[Recalcitrant Interdependence]] illiberal states cluster together, providing reinforcing diplomatic protection upon one another. The result being that it becomes entirely possible that "the End of History" may never happen, even if its predictions are correct. The criticism centers on the contention that "the End of History" can fail without it being overcome by another "the End of History" style concept. A good idea is compelling but not necessarily obligatory to adopt and can be resisted.  . 

{{Quotation |Fukuyama outlines two ways in which his view could fail. The first is megalothymia—the ego rebelling against a society seeking to establish equality. The second is isothymia—a desire to establish an impossible level of equality... very few of the reasons (in Recalcitrant Interdependence) cited for attempting to defy the international consensus fit into these two categories set forth by Fukuyama...However, what Fukuyama essentially fails to recognise is that people can say ‘no’, even to an objectively good idea. His options for the failure of the ‘End of History’ hypothesis are essentially intellectual. Under recalcitrant interdependence, the failure occurs simply because people reject the idea, for a myriad of very bad reasons. <ref>Potter, Robert (2011), 'Recalcitrant Interdependence', Thesis, Flinders University Pg 64</ref>}} . 

===The resurgence of Russia and China===. 
Another challenge to the "End of History" theory is a perceived growth in economic and political power for two countries, [[Russia]] and [[China]]; China has a [[single-party state]] government, while Russia, though a democracy, has been described by some as ''[[de facto]]'' authoritarian. <ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/7386448/Dmitry-Medvedevs-Russia-still-feels-the-cold-hand-of-Vladimir-Putin.html Dmitry Medvedev's Russia still feels the cold hand of Vladimir Putin], Andrew Osborn, ''The Daily Telegraph'', March 7, 2010</ref> . 

[[Azar Gat]], Professor of National Security at [[Tel Aviv University]], argued this point in his 2007  ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' article "The Return of Authoritarian Great Powers", stating that the success of these two countries could "end the end of history". <ref>A. GAT, "The End of the End of History" in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', July/August 2007. </ref> Gat discussed radical Islam as well, but stated that the movements associated with it "represent no viable alternative to modernity and pose no significant military threat to the developed world". He considered the challenge of China and Russia to be the more major threat, since they could pose a viable rival model which could inspire other states.  . 

This view was echoed by [[Robert Kagan]] in his 2008 book ''The Return of History and the End of Dreams'', whose title was a deliberate rejoinder to ''The End of History''. <ref>[http://www.literaryreview.co.uk/burleigh_05_08.html Return of the Dog Pack] (review of ''The Return of History and the End of Dreams''), Michael Burleigh, ''Literary Review'', May 2008</ref> . 

In his 2008 ''Washington Post'' opinion piece, Fukuyama also addressed this point. He wrote, "Despite recent authoritarian advances, liberal democracy remains the strongest, most broadly appealing idea out there. Most autocrats, including [[Vladimir Putin|Putin]] and Chávez, still feel that they have to conform to the outward rituals of democracy even as they gut its substance. Even China's [[Hu Jintao]] felt compelled to talk about democracy in the run-up to [[2008 Summer Olympic|Beijing's Olympic Games]]."<ref name="they can only" /> . 

===Posthuman future===. 
{{See also|Transhumanism}}
Fukuyama himself later conceded that his thesis was incomplete, but for a different reason: "there can be no end of history without an end of modern natural science and technology" (quoted from ''[[Our Posthuman Future]]''). Fukuyama predicts that humanity's control of its own [[evolution]] will have a great and possibly terrible effect on the liberal democracy.  .
