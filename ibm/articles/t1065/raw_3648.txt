== Plato's rejection of Athenian democracy ==. 
The ancient Greek philosopher Plato rejected [[Athenian democracy]] on the basis that such democracies were anarchic societies without internal unity, that they followed citizens' impulses rather than pursuing the [[common good]], that larger democracies are unable to allow a sufficient number of their citizens to have their voices heard, and that such democracies were typically run by fools. <ref name="Erich Kofmel 2008. Pp. 18">Erich Kofmel (ed). ''Anti-Democratic Thought''. Charlottesville, Virginia, USA: Imprint Academic, 2008. Pp. 18. </ref> Plato attacked Athenian democracies for being [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] societies where anarchy is mistaken for freedom. <ref name="Erich Kofmel 2008. Pp. 18"/> The lack of coherent unity in Athenian democracy made Plato conclude that such democracies were a mere collection of individuals occupying a common space rather than a form of political organization. <ref name="Erich Kofmel 2008. Pp. 19">Erich Kofmel (ed). ''Anti-Democratic Thought''. Charlottesville, Virginia, USA: Imprint Academic, 2008. Pp. 19. </ref> As a result, Plato accused such democracies of lacking rules outside where its citizens see fit and lacking leadership due to the notion of equality in Athenian democracy. <ref name="Erich Kofmel 2008. Pp. 19"/> Plato claimed that in Athenian democracy, individuals' pursuit of their own desires led to self-centredness and conflict rather than the pursuit of the common good. <ref name="Erich Kofmel 2008. Pp. 20">Erich Kofmel (ed). ''Anti-Democratic Thought''. Charlottesville, Virginia, USA: Imprint Academic, 2008. Pp. 20. </ref> Due to the citizens being free to pursue their passions, Plato claimed that rational leadership was impossible in Athenian democracy as elected representatives served the citizens' passions. <ref name="Erich Kofmel 2008. Pp. 20"/> Plato claimed that the significance of the voice of the individual in an Athenian democracy depreciates as the population of the democracy increases. <ref>Erich Kofmel (ed). ''Anti-Democratic Thought''. Charlottesville, Virginia, USA: Imprint Academic, 2008. Pp. 22. </ref> . 

== Nietzsche on democracy ==. 
Friedrich Nietzsche as an opponent of [[Christianity]], saw western democracy as connected to it, claiming that "the ''democratic'' movement is Christianity's heir" and denounced the democratic man for being inherently unable to "feel any shame for being unable to rise above" his desire "to satisfy a host of petty wants through the calculation of long-term self-interest". <ref name="Erich Kofmel 2008. Pp. 4">Erich Kofmel (ed). ''Anti-Democratic Thought''. Charlottesville, Virginia, USA: Imprint Academic, 2008. Pp. 4. </ref> Nietzsche claimed that in a democracy "[w]hen the individual's highest and strongest instincts break forth with a passion, driving him far and above the average, beyond the lowlands of the herd conscience", "the moral perspective now considers how harmful or harmless an opinion, an emotional state, a will, a talent is to the community, to equality". "Exalted, self-directed spirituality, a will to solitude, even great powers of reason are felt as a danger". "''Morality in Europe today is herd animal morality''". <ref name="Erich Kofmel 2008. Pp. 4"/> . 

== Maurras on democracy ==. 
French nationalist and neo-royalist Charles Maurras as member of the ''[[Action française]]'' movement stated in a famous dictum "Democracy is evil, democracy is death". Maurras' concept of ''politique naturelle'' declared recognition of inescapable biological inequality and thereby natural hierarchies, and claimed that the individual is naturally subordinated to social collectivities such as the family, the society, and the state, which he claims are doomed to fail if based upon the "myth of equality" or "abstract liberty". <ref>Erich Kofmel (ed). ''Anti-Democratic Thought''. Charlottesville, Virginia, USA: Imprint Academic, 2008. Pp. 68-69. </ref> Maurras criticized democracy as being a "government by numbers" in which quantity matters more over quality and prefers the worst over the best. <ref name="Erich Kofmel 2008. Pp. 69">Erich Kofmel (ed). ''Anti-Democratic Thought''. Charlottesville, Virginia, USA: Imprint Academic, 2008. Pp. 69. </ref> Maurras denounced the principles of [[liberalism]] as described in ''[[The Social Contract]]'' by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and in ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' as based upon the "false" assumption of liberty and the false assumption of equality. <ref name="Erich Kofmel 2008.

Pp. 75">Erich Kofmel (ed). ''Anti-Democratic Thought''. Charlottesville, Virginia, USA: Imprint Academic, 2008. Pp. 75. </ref> Lagardelle opposed democracy for its universalism, and believed in the necessity of class separation of the proletariat from the bourgeoisie, as democracy did not recognize the social differences between them. <ref name="Erich Kofmel 2008. Pp. 75"/> . 

== Tolstoy on democracy ==.

== Michels on democracy ==. 
A major scholarly attack on the basis of democracy was made by German-Italian political scientist [[Robert Michels]] who developed the mainstream political science theory of the [[iron law of oligarchy]] in 1911. <ref>James L. Hyland. ''Democratic theory: the philosophical foundations''. Manchester, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Manchester University Press ND, 1995. Pp. 247. </ref> Michels argued that [[oligarchy]] is inevitable as an "[[iron law of oligarchy|iron law]]" within any organization as part of the "tactical and technical necessities" of organization and on the topic of democracy, Michels stated: "It is organization which gives birth to the dominion of the elected over the electors, of the mandataries over the mandators, of the delegates over the delegators. Who says organization, says oligarchy" and went on to state "Historical evolution mocks all the prophylactic measures that have been adopted for the prevention of oligarchy."<ref>James L. Hyland. Democratic theory: the philosophical foundations. Pp. 247. </ref> Michels stated that the official goal of democracy of eliminating elite rule was impossible, that democracy is a [[façade]] legitimizing the rule of a particular elite, and that elite rule, that he refers to as oligarchy, is inevitable. <ref>James L. Hyland. Democratic theory: the philosophical foundations. Pp. 247. </ref> Michels had formerly been a Marxist but became drawn to the syndicalism of Sorel, [[Eduoard Berth]], [[Arturo Labriola]], and [[Enrico Leone]] and had become strongly opposed parliamentarian, legalistic, and bureaucratic socialism of [[social democracy]] and in contrast supported an activist, voluntarist, anti-parliamentarian socialism. <ref>Blamires, Cyprian, ''World Fascism: a Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1'' (Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 2006) p. 418. </ref> Michels would later become a supporter of fascism upon Mussolini's rise to power in 1922, viewing fascism's goal to destroy liberal democracy in a sympathetic manner. <ref>Blamires, Cyprian, ''World Fascism: a Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1'' (Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 2006) p. 418-419. </ref> . 

== Lenin on democracy ==. 
[[Bolshevik]] leader Vladimir Lenin in ''[[The State and Revolution]]'' denounced democracy, and claimed "Democracy is a state which recognizes the subordination of the minority to the majority, i.e. an organization for the systematic use of violence by one class against another, by one section of the population against another". <ref>Vladimir I. Lenin. The State and Revolution. Kessinger Publishing, 2004. Pp. 69. </ref> . 

== Shach on democracy ==. 
Israeli politician Rabbi [[Elazar Menachem Shach]] promoted [[Judaism|Judaic law]] to be the natural governance for [[Jews]] and condemned democracy, he claimed that "Democracy as a machinery of lies, false notions, pursuit of narrow interests and deceit - as opposed to the [[Torah]] regime, which is based on seeking the ultimate truth". <ref name="Erich Kofmel 2008. Pp. 126">Erich Kofmel (ed). ''Anti-Democratic Thought''. Charlottesville, Virginia, USA: Imprint Academic, 2008. Pp. 126. </ref> Shach criticized democracy for having no real goals, saying "The whole point of democracy is money.

Pp. 126"/> .
