'''Nationalism''' is a political ideology that involves a strong identification of a group of individuals with a political entity defined in national terms, i.e. a [[nation]]. There are two major perspectives on the origins and basis of nationalism, one is the [[Modernism|modernist]] perspective that describes nationalism as a recent phenomenon that requires the structural conditions of modern society, in order to exist; the other is the [[Primordialism|primordialist]] perspective that describes nationalism as a reflection of the ancient and perceived evolutionary tendency of humans to organize into distinct grouping based on an affinity of birth. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 251. </ref> There are various definitions for what constitutes a nation, however, which leads to several different strands of nationalism. It can be a belief that citizenship in a state should be limited to one ethnic, cultural, religious, or identity group, or that multinationality in a single state should necessarily comprise the right to express and exercise national identity even by minorities. <ref name="Kymlicka 1995">{{Cite book|last=Kymlicka |first=Will.|authorlink=Will Kymlicka |title=Multicultural Citizenship: A Liberal Theory of Minority Rights|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=1995|isbn=0198290918|url=http://books.google.com/?id=eiRqsXrJo1UC|page=[http://books.google.com/books?id=eiRqsXrJo1UC&pg=PA16 16]}}</ref> . 

The adoption of national identity in terms of historical development, has commonly been the result of a response by an influential group or groups that is unsatisfied with traditional identities due to inconsistency between their defined social order and the experience of that social order by its members, resulting in a situation of [[anomie]] that nationalists seek to resolve. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 262. </ref> This anomie results in a society or societies reinterpreting identity, retaining elements that are deemed acceptable and removing elements deemed unacceptable, in order to create a unified [[community]]. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 262. </ref> This development may be the result of internal structural issues or the result of resentment by an existing group or groups towards other communities, especially foreign powers that are or are deemed to be controlling them. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 262. </ref> . 

It can also include the belief that the state is of primary importance, or the belief that one state is naturally superior to all other states. <ref name="Smith 1993-p72">{{Cite book|last=Smith|first=Anthony D.|authorlink=Anthony D.

In some cases the identification of a national culture is combined with a negative view of other races or cultures. <ref>Thomas Blank and Peter Schmidt, ''National Identity in a United Germany: Nationalism or Patriotism? An Empirical Test with Representative Data'', in ''Political Psychology'', Vol. 24, No. 2, (2003)</ref> . 

Conversely, nationalism might also be portrayed as collective identities toward [[imagined communities]] which are not naturally expressed in [[language]], [[race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[religion]] but rather [[socially constructed]] by the very individuals that belong to a given [[nation]]. <ref name="Anderson 1991">{{Cite book|last=Anderson|first=Benedict|authorlink=Benedict Anderson|title=Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism|publisher=Verso|location=New York|year=1991|isbn=978-0860915461|pages=37–46|url=http://books.google.com/?id=4mmoZFtCpuoC&lpg=PP1&dq=imagined%20communities&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q}}</ref> These new elements of the nation are commonly presented as long standing and natural, and have been called [[invented traditions]] by the historian [[E.J. Hobsbawm]]. Nationalism is sometimes [[reactionary]], calling for a return to a national past, and sometimes for the expulsion of foreigners. Other forms of nationalism are [[revolutionary]], calling for the establishment of an independent state as a homeland for an ethnic underclass. This was the inspiration for the [[independence of Finland]] from [[Russia]] and the penning of the [[national epic]], the [[Kalevala]].  . 

Nationalism emphasizes collective identity - a 'people' must be autonomous, united, and express a single national culture. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Nationalism|editor=Hutchinson, John and Smith, Anthony D.|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=1994|series=Oxford Readers|pages=4–5}}</ref> [[Integral nationalism]] is a belief that a nation is an organic unit, with a social hierarchy, co-operation between the different social classes and common political goals.

==History==. 
In Europe before the development of nationalism, people were generally loyal to a city or to a particular leader rather than to their nation.  [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] identifies the movement's genesis with the late-18th century [[American Revolution]] and [[French Revolution]]; other historians point specifically to the ultra-nationalist party in [[France]] during the [[French Revolution]]. <ref name=brit>{{Cite web|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|title=Nationalism|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/405644/nationalism|accessdate=2009-12-06}}</ref><ref name="Smith 1998">{{Cite book|last=Smith|first=Anthony D.|authorlink=Anthony D.

The term ''nationalism'' was coined by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] (''nationalismus'') during the late 1770s. <ref>{{Cite book|title=The Culture of Power and the Power of Culture: Old Regime Europe 1660-1789|url=http://books.google.com/?id=3qCIzooCRlwC&pg=PA260&dq=nationalism+pejorative#v=onepage&q=nationalism%20pejorative|author=T.

==Causes==. 
There are two major bodies of thought on the causes of nationalism, one is the [[Modernism|modernist]] perspective that describes nationalism as a recent phenomenon that requires the structural conditions of modern society, in order to exist; the other is the [[Primordialism|primordialist]] perspective that describes nationalism as a reflection of the ancient and perceived evolutionary tendency of humans to organize into distinct grouping based on an affinity of birth. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 251. </ref> Roger Masters in The Nature of Politics says that both the primordialist and modernist conception of nationalism both involve an acceptance of three levels of common interest of individuals or groups in national identity. The first level is that at an inter-group level, humans respond to competition or conflict by organizing into groups to either attack other groups or defend their group from hostile groups. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 253. </ref> The second level is the intragroup level, individuals gain advantage through cooperation with others in securing collective goods that are not accessible through individual effort alone. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 253. </ref> The third level is the individual level, where self-interested concerns over personal fitness by individuals either consciously or subconciously motivate the creation of group formation as a means of security. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 253. </ref> Leadership groups' or elites' behaviour that involves efforts to advance their own fitness when they are involved in the mobilization of an ethnic or national group is crucial in the development of the culture of that group. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 253. </ref> . 

===Primordialist interpretation===. 
The primordialist perspective is based upon evolutionary theory. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 272-273. </ref> The evolutionary theory of nationalism perceives nationalism to be the result of the evolution of human beings into identifying with groups, such as ethnic groups, or other groups that form the foundation of a nation. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 272-273. </ref> Roger Masters in The Nature of Politics describes the primordial explanation of the origin of ethnic and national groups as recognizing group attachments that are thought to be unique, emotional, intense, and durable because they are based upon [[kinship]] and promoted along lines of common ancestry. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 273. </ref>  . 

The primordialist evolutionary view of nationalism has its origins in the evolutionary theories of [[Charles Darwin]] that were later substantially elaborated by [[John Tooby]] and [[Leda Cosmides]]. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 268. </ref> Central to evolutionary theory is that all biological organisms under changes in their anatomical features and their characteristic behaviour patterns. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 268. </ref> Darwin's theory of [[natural selection]] as a mechanism of evolutionary change of organisms is utilized to describe the development of human societies and particularly the development of mental and physical traits of of members of such societies. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 269. </ref>  . 

In addition to evolutionary development of mental and physical traits, Darwin and other evolutionary theorists emphasize the influence of the types of environment upon behaviour. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 271. </ref> First of all there are ancestral environments that are typically long-term and stable forms of situations that influence mental development of individuals or groups gained either biologically through birth or learned from family or relatives, that cause the emphasis of certain mental behaviours that are developed due to their necessity the ancestral environment . <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 271. </ref> In national group settings, these ancestral environments can result in psychological triggers in the minds of individuals within a group, such as responding positively to patriotic cues. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 271. </ref> There are immediate environments that are those situations that confront an individual or group at a given point and activate certain mental responses. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 271. </ref> In the case of a national group, the example of seeing the mobilization of a foreign military force on the nation's borders may provoke members of a national group to unify and mobilize themselves in response. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 271. </ref> There are proximate environments where individuals identify nonimmediate real or imagined situations in combination with immediate situations that make individuals confront a common situation of both subjective and objective components that affect their decisions. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 272. </ref> As such proximate environments cause people make decisions based on existing situations and anticipated situations. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 272. </ref> In the context of the politics of nations and nationalism, a political leader may adopt an international treaty not out of a benevolent stance but in the believe that such a treaty will either benefit their nation or will increase the prestige of their nation. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 272. </ref> The proximate environment plays a role in the politics of nations that are angry with their circumstances, an individual or group that becomes angry in response to feelings that they are being exploited usually results in efforts to accommodate them, while being passive results in them being ignored. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 272. </ref> Nations that are angry with circumstances imposed on them by others are affected by the proximate environment that shapes the nationalism of such nations. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 272. </ref>  . 

[[Pierre van der Berghe]] in ''[[The Ethnic Phenomenon]]'' (1981) emphasizes the role of ethnicity and kinship involving family biological ties to members of an ethnic group as being an important element of national identity. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 274. </ref> Van der Berghe states the sense of family attachments among related people as creating durable, intense, emotional, and cooperative attachments, that he claims are utilized within ethnic groups.. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 274. </ref> Van der Berghe identifies genetic-relatedness as being a basis for the durable attachments of family groups, as genetic ties cannot be removed and they are passed on from generation to generation. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 274. </ref> Van der Berge identifies common descent as the basis for the establishment of boundaries of ethnic groups, as most people to not join ethnic groups but are born into them. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 274. </ref> Berghe notes that this kinship group affiliation and solidarity does not require actual relatedness but can include imagined relatedness that may not be biologically accurate. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 273. </ref>  Berghe notes that feelings of ethnic solidarity usually arise in small and compact groups whereas there is less solidarity in large and dispersed groups. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 275. </ref> . 

There are functionalist interpretations of the primordialist evolutionary theory. The functionalists claim that ethnic and national groups are founded upon individuals' concerns over distribution of resources acquired through individual and collective action. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 276. </ref> This is resolved by the formation of a [[clan]] group that defines who is accepted within the group and defines the boundaries within which the resources will be distributed. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 276. </ref> This functionalist interpretation does not require genetic-relatedness, and identifies a variety of reasons for ethnic or national group formation. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 276. </ref> The first reason is that such groups may extend group identity and cooperation beyond the limited of family and kinship out of  reciprocal altruism, in the belief that helping other individuals will produce an advantageous situation for both the sender and receiver of that help, this tendency has been noted in studies by [[Robert Axelrod]] that are summarized in his book ''[[The Evolution of Cooperation]]'' (1984). <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 276. </ref> The second reason is that such groups may be formed as a means of defense to insure survival, fears by one group of a hostile group threatening them can increase solidarity amongst that group, [[R. Paul Shaw]] and [[Yuwa Wong]] in their book ''[[The Genetic Seeds of Warfare]]'' (1989) identify this as the foundation of [[xenophobia]] that they identify as originating in hunter gatherer societies. <ref>Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 277. </ref> .

</ref> According to the principles of civic nationalism, the nation is not based on common ethnic ancestry, but is a political entity whose core identity is not ethnicity. This civic concept of nationalism is exemplified by [[Ernest Renan]] in his lecture in 1882 "[[What is a Nation?]]", where he defined the nation as a "daily referendum" (frequently translated 'daily [[plebiscite]]") dependent on the will of its people to continue living together". <ref name="blackwell"/> .

Civic nationalism lies within the [[tradition]]s of [[rationalism]] and [[liberalism]], but as a form of nationalism it is contrasted with [[ethnic nationalism]]. Membership of the civic [[nation]] is considered voluntary, as in [[Ernest Renan]]'s  "daily referendum" formulation in [[What is a Nation?]]. Civic-national ideals influenced the development of [[representative democracy]] in countries such as the [[United States]] and [[France]] (see the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] of 1776, and the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' of 1789).  .

Whereas nationalism does not necessarily imply a belief in the superiority of one ethnicity over others, some nationalists support ethnocentric protectionism or ethnocentric supremacy. Studies have yielded evidence that such behaviour may be derived from innate preferences in humans from infancy. <ref>{{Cite journal

===National purity=== . 

Some nationalists exclude certain groups. Some nationalists, defining the national community in ethnic, linguistic, cultural, historic, or religious terms (or a combination of these), may then seek to deem certain minorities as not truly being a part of the 'national community' as they define it. Sometimes a mythic homeland is more important for the national identity than the actual territory occupied by the nation. <ref>Smith, Anthony D. 1986. The Ethnic Origins of Nations London: Basil Blackwell. pp 6–18. ISBN 0-631-15205-9. </ref> . 

===Left-wing nationalism===. 
[[Left-wing nationalism]] (occasionally known as [[Socialism|socialist]] nationalism, not to be confused with [[national socialism]])<ref>[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119472227/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 Political Science, Volume 35, Issue 2; ''Class and Nation: Problems of Socialist Nationalism'']</ref> refers to any political movement that combines [[left-wing politics]] with nationalism. 
Many nationalist movements are dedicated to national liberation, in the view that their nations are being persecuted by other nations and thus need to exercise [[self-determination]] by liberating themselves from the accused persecutors. [[Anti-Revisionism|Anti-revisionist]] [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist-Leninism]] is closely tied with this ideology, and practical examples include Stalin's early work ''Marxism and the National Question'' and his [[Socialism in One Country]] edict, which declares that nationalism can be used in an internationalist context, fighting for national liberation without racial or religious divisions. Other examples of left-wing nationalism include [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[26th of July Movement]] that launched the [[Cuban Revolution]] ousting the American-backed [[Fulgencio Batista]] in 1959, [[Ireland]]'s [[Sinn Féin]], [[Wales]]'s [[Plaid Cymru]], [[Scotland]]'s [[Scottish National Party|SNP]], the [[Awami League]] in [[Bangladesh]] and the [[African National Congress]] in [[South Africa]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.....  . 

===Territorial nationalism===. 
{{Main|Territorial nationalism}}
[[File:Brasil ame-o ou deixe-o.png|thumb|200px|Nationalist slogan "''Brazil, love it or leave it''", often used during the [[Brazilian military government|Brazilian military dictatorship]].]] .

===Pan-nationalism=== . 

[[Pan-nationalism]] is unique in that it covers a large area span. Pan-nationalism focuses more on "clusters" of ethnic groups.  . 

===Ultranationalism===. 
Ultranationalism is a zealous nationalism that expresses extremist support for one's nationalist ideals. It is often characterized by [[authoritarianism]], efforts toward reduction or stoppage of immigration, expulsion and or oppression of non-native populations within the nation or its territories, demagoguery of leadership, emotionalism, fomenting talk of presumed, real, or imagined enemies, predicating the existence of threats to the survival of the native, dominant or otherwise idealized national ethnicity or population group, instigation or extremist reaction to crack-down policies in law enforcement, efforts to limit international trade through tariffs, tight control over businesses and production, militarism, populism and propaganda. Prevalent ultranationalism typically leads to or is the result of conflict within a state, and or between states, and is identified as a condition of pre-war in national politics.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} In its extremist forms ultranationalism is characterized as a call to [[war]] against enemies of the nation/state, [[secession]] or, in the case of ethnocentrist ultranationalism, [[genocide]]. <ref>http://www.maknews.com/html/articles/savich/nationalism.pdf</ref><ref name="Connor 1994p29">{{Cite book|last=Connor|first=Walker|authorlink=Walker Connor|title=Ethnonationalism: The Quest for Understanding|location=Princeton, New Jersey|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1994|url=http://books.google.com/?id=bmgineq0r3MC&printsec=frontcover|page=29 | isbn=9780691025636}}</ref> .

Fascists sometimes promote ethnic or cultural nationalism. Fascism stresses the subservience of the individual to the state, and the need to absolute and unquestioned loyalty to a strong ruler. <ref>Roger Griffin, ''Fascism'', Oxford University Press, 1995, ISBN 978-0192892492. </ref> . 

=== Anti-colonial nationalism ===. 
This form of nationalism came about during the decolonialisation of the post war period. It was a reaction mainly in Africa and Asia against being subdued by foreign powers. This form of nationalism took many guises, including the peaceful passive resistance movement led by Gandhi in the Indian subcontinent <ref>{{cite web|last=Grant|first=Moyra|title=Politics Review|url=http://moodle.collyers.ac.uk/file.php/465/Politics_Review_articles/nationalism_expansionistanddesrtuctive.pdf|work=Moyra Grant is an experienced politics teacher, examiner and author.|publisher=Politics Review|accessdate=16 April 2011}}</ref> Benedict Anderson argued that anti-colonial nationalism is grounded in the experience of literate and bilingual indigenous intellectuals fluent in the language of the imperial power, schooled in its "national" history, and staffing the colonial administrative cadres up to but not including its highest levels. Post-colonial national governments have been essentially indigenous forms of the previous imperial administration. <ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Benedict|year=1983|title=Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism|pages=37–46|location=New York|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-0860915461}}</ref> . 

==Criticisms==. 
{{Main|Anti-nationalism}}
Critics of nationalism have argued that it is often unclear what constitutes a "nation", or why a nation should be the only legitimate unit of political rule. A nation is a cultural entity, and not necessarily a political association, nor is it necessarily linked to a particular territorial area - although nationalists argue that the boundaries of a nation and a state should, as far as possible, coincide. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Heywood|first=Andrew|title=Political Theory: An Introduction|publisher=Macmillan Press|location=London|year=1999|edition=Second|pages=97–98|isbn=0333760913}}</ref> Philosopher [[A.C. Grayling]] describes nations as artificial constructs, "their boundaries drawn in the blood of past wars". He argues that "there is no country on earth which is not home to more than one different but usually coexisting culture. Cultural heritage is not the same thing as national identity". <ref>{{Cite book|last=Grayling|first=A.C.|title=The Meaning of Things. Applying Philosophy to Life.|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|location=London|year=2001|pages=78–79|isbn=0297607588}}</ref> . 

Nationalism is inherently divisive because it highlights perceived differences between people, emphasizing an individual's identification with their own nation. The idea is also potentially oppressive because it submerges individual identity within a national whole, and gives elites or political leaders potential opportunities to manipulate or control [[Common people|the masses]]. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Heywood|first=Andrew|title=Key Concepts in Politics|publisher=Macmillan Press|location=London|year=2000|page=256|isbn=0333770951}}</ref>
Much of the early opposition to nationalism was related to its geopolitical ideal of a separate state for every nation. The classic nationalist movements of the 19th century rejected the very existence of the multi-ethnic empires in Europe. Even in that early stage, however, there was an ideological critique of nationalism. That has developed into several forms of [[anti-nationalism]] in the western world. The Islamic revival of the 20th century also produced an Islamic critique of the nation-state.  . 

At the end of the 19th century, [[Marxism|Marxists]] and other [[socialism|socialists]] (such as [[Rosa Luxemburg]]) produced political analysis that were critical of the nationalist movements then active in [[central Europe|central]] and [[eastern Europe]] (though a variety of other contemporary socialists and communists, from [[Lenin]] (a communist) to [[Józef Piłsudski]] (a socialist), were more sympathetic to [[national self-determination]]). <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1959/rosalux/6-natquest.htm |title=Rosa Luxemburg and the national question |accessdate=2008-08-02|last=Cliff |first=Tony |authorlink=Tony Cliff|year=1959|publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]]}}</ref> . 

In his classic essay on the topic [[George Orwell]] distinguishes nationalism from patriotism, which he defines as devotion to a particular place. Nationalism, more abstractly, is "power-hunger tempered by self-deception." <ref name=NonN>George Orwell, [http://orwell.ru/library/essays/nationalism/english/e_nat Notes on Nationalism], [http://orwell.ru orwell.ru]. </ref> . 

For Orwell the nationalist is more likely than not dominated by irrational negative impulses: . 

{{quote|There are, for example, Trotskyists who have become simply enemies of the U.S.S.R. without developing a corresponding loyalty to any other unit. When one grasps the implications of this, the nature of what I mean by nationalism becomes a good deal clearer. A nationalist is one who thinks solely, or mainly, in terms of competitive prestige. He may be a positive or a negative nationalist — that is, he may use his mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating — but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs and humiliations. He sees history, especially contemporary history, as the endless rise and decline of great power units, and every event that happens seems to him a demonstration that his own side is on the upgrade and some hated rival is on the downgrade. But finally, it is important not to confuse nationalism with mere worship of success. The nationalist does not go on the principle of simply ganging up with the strongest side. On the contrary, having picked his side, he persuades himself that it is the strongest, and is able to stick to his belief even when the facts are overwhelmingly against him. <ref name=NonN />}}

In the [[liberalism|liberal political tradition]] there is widespread criticism of ‘nationalism’ as a dangerous force and a cause of conflict and [[war]] between nation-states. Nationalism has often been exploited to encourage citizens to partake in the nations' conflicts. Such examples include The Two World Wars, where nationalism was a key component of propaganda material. Liberals do not generally dispute the existence of the nation-states. The liberal critique also emphasizes individual freedom as opposed to national identity, which is by definition [[collectivism|collective]].  . 

The [[Pacifism|pacifist]] critique of nationalism also concentrates on the violence of nationalist movements, the associated [[militarism]], and on conflicts between nations inspired by [[jingoism]] or [[chauvinism]]. National symbols and patriotic assertiveness are in some countries discredited by their historical link with past wars, especially in Germany. Famous pacifist [[Bertrand Russell]] criticizes nationalism for diminishing the individual's capacity to judge his or her fatherland's foreign policy. <ref>''Russell Speaks His Mind'', 1960. Fletcher and son Ltd., Norwich, United Kingdom</ref>  [[Albert Einstein]] stated that "Nationalism is an infantile disease... It is the measles of mankind." <ref>Einstein http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/a/alberteins107012.html</ref> . 

The [[anti-racism|anti-racist]] critique of nationalism concentrates on the attitudes to other nations, and especially on the doctrine that the nation-state exists for one national group to the exclusion of others. This view emphasizes the chauvinism and [[xenophobia]] that have often resulted from nationalist sentiment. [[Norman Naimark]] relates the rise of nationalism to [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[genocide]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} . 

Political movements of the left have often been suspicious of nationalism, again without necessarily seeking the disappearance of the existing nation-states. [[Marxism]] has been ambiguous towards the nation-state, and in the late 19th century some Marxist theorists rejected it completely. For some Marxists the [[world revolution]] implied a global state (or global absence of state); for others it meant that each nation-state had its own revolution. A significant event in this context was the failure of the [[social-democratic]] and [[socialist]] movements in Europe to mobilize a cross-border workers' opposition to [[World War I]]. At present most, but certainly not all, [[left-wing]] groups accept the nation-state, and see it as the [[Politics|political arena]] for their activities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} . 

[[Anarchism]] has developed a [[Anarchism and nationalism|critique of nationalism]] that focuses on its role in justifying and consolidating state power and domination. Through its unifying goal it strives for centralization both in specific territories and in a ruling elite of individuals while it prepares a population for capitalist exploitation. Within anarchism this subject has been treated extensively by [[Rudolf Rocker]] in ''[[Nationalism and Culture]]'' and by the works of [[Fredy Perlman]] such as ''[[Against His-Story, Against Leviathan]]'' and "The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism".{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}
[[File:AmericanFries.JPG|thumbnail|A snack bar sign advertising "American" fries at [[Knott's Berry Farm]]. The sign formerly read "French".]]
In the [[Western world]], the most comprehensive current ideological alternative to nationalism is [[cosmopolitanism]].  Ethical cosmopolitanism rejects one of the basic ethical principles of nationalism: that humans owe more duties to a fellow member of the nation, than to a non-member.  It rejects such important nationalist values as national identity and national loyalty. However, there is also a political cosmopolitanism, which has a geopolitical program to match that of nationalism: it seeks some form of [[world state]], with a [[world government]].  Very few people openly and explicitly support the establishment of a global state, but political cosmopolitanism has influenced the development of international criminal law, and the erosion of the status of national [[sovereignty]]. In turn, nationalists are deeply suspicious of cosmopolitan attitudes, which they equate with eradication of diverse national cultures.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} . 

While [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] in the cosmopolitan context by definition implies cooperation among nations and states, and therefore the existence of nations, [[proletarian internationalism]] is different, in that it calls for the international [[working class]] to follow its brethren in other countries irrespective of the activities or pressures of the national government of a particular sector of that class. Meanwhile, most ([[National-Anarchism|but not all]]) [[anarchists]] reject [[nation-states]] on the basis of [[self-determination]] of the majority social class, and thus reject nationalism. Instead of nations, anarchists usually advocate the creation of cooperative societies based on [[freedom of association|free association]] and [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]] without regard to [[ethnicity]] or race.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} .
