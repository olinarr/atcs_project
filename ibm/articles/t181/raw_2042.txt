"'''Cultural mosaic'''" ({{lang-fr|"la mosaïque culturelle canadienne"}}) is a term used to describe the mix of [[ethnic groups]], [[languages]] and [[cultures]] that co-exist within [[Canada|Canadian]] society. <ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=z1OcatV808wC&lpg=PA111&dq=Cultural%20mosaic%20Canada&pg=PA111#v=onepage&q&f=true|pages=111–115|title=Understanding military culture: a Canadian perspective|first=Allan |last=Douglas |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|year=2004|isbn=0773526641|accessdate=2011-01-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=gPEItATPByoC&pg=PA4&dq=Canadian+Cultural+mosaic&hl=en&ei=nWMzTbi8AcGblgfz3Yj9CQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q&f=true|page=4|title=Canada: The Culture|first=Bobbie |last=Kalman|publisher=Crabtree Pub|year=2010|isbn=9780778792840|accessdate=2011-01-16}}</ref>  The idea of a cultural mosaic is intended to champion an ideal of [[multiculturalism]], differently from other systems like the [[melting pot]], which is often used to describe the neighboring [[United States]]' ideal of [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. <ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=TuggI-Ye_AUC&lpg=PA31&dq=Cultural%20mosaic%20Canada&pg=PA31#v=onepage&q&f=true|page=31|title=Guide to Western Canada|edition=7th|first1=Ann Carroll|last1= Burgess|first2=Tom |last2=Burgess|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|year=2005|isbn=0762729872|accessdate = 2011-01-16}}</ref><ref>Levine, Randy and Gifty Serbeh-Dunn (Spring 1999).

==Overview==. 
An ethnocultural profile of Canada prepared by [[Statistics Canada]] describes a nation that, at the outset of the 21st Century, has become progressively more and more multi-ethnic and multicultural. The Introduction to the report stated that: . 

<blockquote>[[Immigration to Canada]] over the past 100 years has shaped Canada, with each new wave of immigrants adding to the nation’s ethnic and cultural composition. Half a century ago, most immigrants came from Europe. Now most newcomers are from Asia.''
<br>
As a result, the number of [[visible minority|visible minorities]] in Canada is growing. And, Canadians listed more than 200 ethnic groups in answering the 2001 Census question on ethnic ancestry, reflecting a varied, rich cultural mosaic as the nation started the new millennium. <ref>Statistics Canada. [http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/analytic/companion/etoimm/canada.cfm Canada’s ethnocultural portrait: The changing mosaic.]</ref></blockquote> . 

==Origin and use of the term==. 
The first use of the term ''mosaic'' to refer to Canadian society was by [[John Murray Gibbon]], in his 1938 book ''[[Canadian Mosaic]]''.  Gibbon clearly disapproved of the American melting-pot concept.  He saw the melting pot as a process by which [[immigrants]] and their descendants were encouraged to cut off ties with their countries and cultures of origin so as to assimilate into the American way of life. <ref name = Vertical>Valee, F. [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0008342 Vertical Mosaic]. The Canadian Encyclopedia. Historica Dominion. Retrieved on: 2011-09-22. </ref> . 

In 1965, [[John Porter (sociologist)|John Porter]] published his influential sociological study, ''Vertical Mosaic: An Analysis of Social Class and Power in Canada''.  Porter's book showed that some groups (e.g., those of [[United Kingdom|British]] origin) were better off with respect to measures of income, education and health than others.  For example, groups of eastern and southern European origin tended to fare less well by these measures.  The worst off were the [[First Nations]] and [[Inuit]].  Porter saw this vertical arrangement as being related to power and influence in decision-making.  Thus those of British origin tended to be overrepresented among the [[elites]] in [[government]], [[economic]] and [[political]] spheres. <ref name = Vertical/> . 

Porter’s findings have been tested in several studies since 1965 and have been modified slightly.  For example, the economic disparity between ethnic groups has narrowed somewhat and [[Francophone]]s are better represented in politics and government.  However, the [[socio-economic]] elites in Canada remain dominated by people of British origin. <ref name = Vertical/> . 

==Influence on multiculturalism policy==. 
Since the beginning of the 20th century, Canada has been one of the world's major immigrant-receiving societies.  Until the 1960s immigrants were expected to assimilate into the mainstream society.  Arriving as it did at during a time of social upheaval, Porter's work had a marked influence on Canadian [[social policy]].  The view of Canada as a mosaic of cultures became the basis for the [[Pierre Trudeau|Trudeau]] government's [[multiculturalism]] policies in the early 1970s.  . 

The Canadian government established the [[Official Multiculturalism Act]] in 1971 and appointed a minister responsible for multiculturalism in 1972.  In 1973 a Canadian Multiculturalism Council was established, along with a Multiculturalism Branch within the Department of the Secretary of State.  . 

==Criticism== . 

The "cultural mosaic" theory is not without critics. Some pundits, such as the [[Globe and Mail]]'s [[Jeffrey Simpson]], and [[Carleton University]] journalism professor, [[Andrew Cohen (journalist)|Andrew Cohen]] have argued that the entire Melting Pot / Mosaic dynamic is largely an imagined concept, and that there remains little measurable evidence that American or Canadian immigrants as collective groups can be proven to be more or less "assimilated" or "multicultural" than each other. <ref>Gardner, D. (September 24, 2008). [http://www.ottawacitizen.com/columnists/often+more+like+Americans+than+like+other+Canadians/824878/story.html "We're often more like Americans than we're like other Canadians."] Canwest.com ''Ottawa Citizen.'' Retrieved on: 2009-11-20. </ref> Many [[Canadian conservatism|conservative]] activists in Canada have likewise remained critical of multiculturalism as an "official" government policy. In April 2005 [[Michaëlle Jean]] (later named the Governor General) openly criticized the concept herself, accusing it of leading to the "ghettoizing" of Canadians. <ref>[http://www.free-access.com/index.php?display=news.20051006a Ghettoization and the Cultural Mosaic], ''Free Access''</ref> .
