'''Cultural assimilation''' is a [[socio-political]] response to demographic multi-ethnicity that supports or promotes the assimilation of [[ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]] into the dominant [[culture]]. The term assimilation is often used when referring to immigrants and various ethnic groups settling in a new land. New customs and attitudes are acquired through contact and communication. Each group of immigrants contributes some of its own cultural traits to the new society. Assimilation usually involves a gradual change and takes place in varying degrees; full assimilation occurs when new members of a society become indistinguishable from older members.  . 

== Cultural influence ==. 
A group (a state or an ethnicity) can spontaneously adopt a different culture due to its political relevance,  or to its perceived superiority. The first is the case of the [[Latin|Latin language]] and culture, that were gradually adopted by most of the subjugated people.  . 

The second is the case of subjugated, but older and richer culture, which see itself imitated by the new masters, e.g. the victorious [[Roman Republic]] adopted more from the [[Hellenistic]] cultures than it imposed in most domains, except such Roman specialties as [[Roman Law|law]] and the military.  . 

Cultural assimilation will happen either way; spontaneously or forcedly. A culture can spontaneously adopt a different culture or the case of subjugated, meaning that older and richer cultures forcedly integrate other weak cultures. The term assimilation is often used with regard to immigrants and various ethnic groups who have settled in a new land. New culture and attitudes toward the origin culture are obtained through contact and communication. [[culture change|Cultural changing]] is not simply a one-way process. Assimilation assume that a relatively tenuous culture get to be united to mighty culture. This process is going through contact with each cultures and accommodation. Current definition of assimilation is usually used in the immigrants, but in [[multiculturalism]], cultural assimilation can happened all over the world, not just be limited in specific area. For example, the united language gives people chance to study and work internationally, not just being limited to the same culture group. People from different countries make diversity and compose the “global culture” which means the culture combined by the elements from different countries. This “global culture” can be seen as a part of assimilation that causes cultures from different areas affect each other.  .

Immigrant assimilation is a complex process in which an immigrant fully integrates themselves into a new country. Social scientists rely on four primary benchmarks to assess immigrant assimilation: [[socioeconomic status]], geographic distribution, [[second language]] attainment, and [[interracial marriage|intermarriage]]. <ref name="Waters" />  William A.V. Clark defines immigrant assimilation "as a way of understanding the social dynamics of American society and that it is the process that occurs spontaneously and often unintended in the course of interaction between majority and [[minority groups]]". <ref name="Clark">{{Cite book |last=Clark |first=W. |year=2003 |title=Immigrants and the American Dream: Remaking the Middle Class |location=New York |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=157230880X }}</ref> . 

It has been found that between 1880 and 1920, the United States took in roughly 24 million immigrants. <ref name="Waters">{{Cite journal |last=Waters |first=Mary C. |last2=Jiménez |first2=Tomás R. |title=Assessing Immigrant Assimilation: New Empirical and Theoretical Challenges |journal=[[Annual Review of Sociology]] |volume=31 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=105–125 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100026 }}</ref>  This increase in immigration can be attributed to many historical changes. Later, during the [[cold war]] from the 1960s through the 1980s and the disintegration of the [[Soviet Union]] in the late 1980s, over 1.8 million Jews (including some non-Jewish family members) emigrated from the former Soviet Union. The major destination countries were Israel (about 1.1 million), the [[United States]] (over 400,000), Germany (about 130,000), and Canada (about 30,000). <ref name="Googlebook">{{cite book|title=Reviewing the Cold War: approaches, interpretations, and theory|first=Odd Arne|last=Westad|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2000|isbn=0714681202|page=232}}</ref> The beginning of the twenty-first century has also marked a massive era of immigration, and sociologists are once again trying to make sense of the impact that immigration has on society and the impact it has on immigrants themselves. <ref name="Waters"/> . 

=== Theoretical explanations === . 

Researchers have attempted to explain the assimilation rate for post 1965 immigrants in the [[United States]] with experiences of immigrants who entered the United States between 1880 and 1920. Many of the methods and [[theories]] that are used to assess immigrant assimilation today are derived from earlier immigrant studies.  One of the leading theories in understanding immigrant assimilation came from William I. Thomas and Florian Znaniecki who published ''The Polish Peasant in Europe and America''. Thomas and Znaniecki's study on Polish immigrants (1880–1910) assessed how these immigrants built an [[institutional]] community in the United States during the [[Napoleonic War]]. <ref>{{cite book|title=The Polish peasant in Europe and America: a classic work in immigration history |first=William Isaac|last=Thomas|coauthors=Florian Znaniecki, Eli Zaretsky |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=1996 |isbn=0252064844}}</ref> Another influence on immigrant assimilation came from Robert Park, Ernest Burgess, and William I. Thomas, in which they trained graduate students to study the experiences of immigrants in [[Chicago]].  Park, Burgess, and Thomas provided these graduate students with theoretical tools such as Park's theory on collective behavior. The third theory on immigrant assimilation comes from Gordon's book, ''Assimilation in American life''.  Gordon highlighted the generational change in immigrant groups; it states that the first generation or foreign-born were less assimilated and less exposed to American life than their American-born children (the second generation), and their grandchildren (third-generation) were more like the American mainstream than their parents. <ref name="Waters"/> . 

====Theoretical models to immigrant assimilation==== . 

The first, classic and new assimilation model sees immigrants and native-born people following a "straight-line" or a convergence. This theory sees immigrants becoming more similar over time in norms, values, behaviors, and characteristics. This [[theory]] also expects those immigrants residing the longest in the host population, as well as the members of later [[generations]], to show greater similarities with the majority group than immigrants who have spent less time in the host society. <ref name="ass1">{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/feature/display.cfm?id=442 |title=Assimilation Models, Old and New: Explaining a Long-Term Process |author=Brown, Susan K.; Bean, Frank D.|accessdate=2009-09-07}}</ref> The second, [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] or [[ethnic]] disadvantage model states that immigrant's chances to assimilate are "blocked". <ref>http://www.cri.uci.edu/pdf/NewImmigrantsNewModelsOfAssimilation_082306.pdf</ref> An example of this model would be discrimination and institutional barriers to [[employment]] and other opportunities. The third, the segmented assimilation model theorizes that structural barriers, such as poor urban schools, cut off access to [[employment]] and other opportunities—obstacles that often are particularly severe in the case of the most disadvantaged members of [[immigrant]] groups, and such impediments can lead to stagnant or downward [[social mobility|mobility]], even as the children of other immigrants follow divergent paths toward classic straight-line assimilation. <ref name="ass1" /> . 

==== Core measurements to immigrant assimilation ==== . 

Researchers have assessed that assimilation exists among immigrants because we can measure assimilation on four primary benchmarks. These core measurable aspects of immigrant assimilation that were formulated to study [[European ethnic groups|European]] [[immigrants]] to the United States are still the starting points for understanding immigrant assimilation. These measurable aspects of assimilation are [[socioeconomic status]], spatial concentration, language attainment, and intermarriage. <ref name="Waters"/> . 

#''Socioeconomic status'' is defined by [[educational attainment]], [[Employment|occupation]], and [[income]]. By measuring socioeconomic status researchers want to find out if immigrants eventually catch up to [[native-born]] people in terms of [[human capital]] characteristics. 
#''Spatial concentration'' is defined by [[geography]] or [[residential]] patterns. The spatial residential model (based on theories of Park) proposed by Massey states that increasing socioeconomic attainment, longer residence in the U.S, and higher generational status lead to decreasing residential concentration for a particular ethnic group. <ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ellis |first=Mark |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Goodwin-White |first2=J. |title=Generation Internal Migration in the U.S.: Dispersion from States of Immigration? |journal=International Migration Review |volume=40 |issue=4 |year=2006 |pages=899–926 |doi=10.1111/j.1747-7379.2006.00048.x }}</ref>
#''Language attainment'' is defined as the ability to speak [[English language|English]] and the loss of the individual's [[mother tongue]]. The three-generation model of language assimilation states that the first [[generation]] makes some progress in language assimilation but remains dominant in their [[native tongue]], the second generation is [[bilingual]], and the third-generation speaks only English. <ref name="Waters"/>
#''Intermarriage'' is  defined by [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[ethnicity]] and occasionally by [[generation]]. <ref name="Waters"/> High rates of [[interracial marriage|intermarriage]] are considered to be an indication of [[social integration]] because it reveals intimate and profound relations between people of different groups;  intermarriage reduces the ability of families to pass on to their children a consistent ethnic [[culture]] and thus is an agent of assimilation. <ref>{{Cite journal |last=Pagnini |first=L. |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Morgan |first2=S. P. |title=Intermarriage and the social distance among U.S. Immigrants at the Turn of the Century |journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]] |volume=96 |issue=2 |year=1990 |pages=405–432 |doi=10.1086/229534 }}</ref> Intermarriage came under particular scrutiny by the Jewish community in the early-mid 20th century as Jewish leaders more and more often turned to social scientists to explain why Judaism was a typically endogamic religion. Although intermarriage was viewed as a firm base from which to begin an argument for assimilation, it was also seen as a way to gradually ease the transition into their new culture. Julius Draschler, a graduate student at Columbia University, believed that as long as people are allowed to maintain some differences, such as the Jewish practice of marrying only another Jew, they will delay the inevitable while simultaneously enriching the nation in the process of their slow assimilation. While Draschler acknowledged that assimilation was the ultimate endpoint for all American groups, he hoped to prove through his intermarriage studies that, the more gradual the process, the better. Such need to justify (or vilify) the intermarriage practice became increasingly important after the 1950s as Jews (as well as other typically endogamic cultures, such as African-Americans) began to engage in more exogamic relationships. <ref>{{Cite journal |last=Berman |first=Lila |title=Sociology, Jews, and Intermarriage in Twentieth-Century America |journal=Jewish Social Studies |volume=14 |issue=2 |year=2008 |pages=32–60 |doi=10.2979/JSS.2008.14.2.32 }}</ref> . 

====Immigrant name changing as a form of assimilation==== . 

While the changing of immigrant names is not one of the 4 measurable benchmarks for assimilation outlined by early sociologists, it nonetheless represents a clear abandonment of the old as new immigrants are absorbed into the fabric of society. It is often believed that, due to language barriers, or the lack of training and sensitivity by government officials, names were often changed, without consent, by inspectors on [[Ellis Island]]. This general misconstruction of the facts is refuted in an article released by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, claiming that inspectors did not personally take names, instead inventorying the passengers using manifestos created by the shipping companies themselves. As a matter of fact, many immigrants changed their names willingly.  . 

It is suggested by the Immigration and Naturalization Service that most name blunders were likely the fault of the origin and not the destination. Donna Przecha, a published and well-known expert in genealogy, suggests a number of alternative explanations for name changing, one of which was a need for employment. A huge surplus of labor began to immigrate to the United States, many of whom were unskilled, with names that were often difficult to pronounce. Employers were not bound by the same anti-discriminatory legislature that exists now and tended to gravitate toward individuals with more American names.  . 

Comfort and fitting in was also a heavy motivator behind the changing of names. Many, if not most, US immigrants in the mid-1900s planned to make the United States their new home, permanently. Given this fact, it should come as no surprise that many immigrants welcomed the impending assimilation brought on by their host country. Eager to begin their new lives, many did as much as they could to become "American" as quickly as possible, particularly children. Of course, simplicity was yet another factor in the abandonment of old titles. As immigrants poured in from various European countries, many found their names to be difficult to pronounce and/or spell for many Americans. <ref>{{Cite web |last=Przecha |first=Donna |title=They Changed Our Name at Ellis Island |date= |url=http://www.genealogy.com/88_donna.html }}</ref> . 

====Policies on immigrant assimilation==== . 

When considering immigrant assimilation it is important to consider why immigrants [[human migration|migrate]]. One reason immigrants migrated was the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), which legalized 2.3 million formerly undocumented [[Mexican people|Mexican]] Immigrants. This Act freed these newly legalized immigrants from the fear of being apprehended, and many of these immigrants moved to states beyond the nearest U.S-Mexican border. <ref name="Waters"/> . 

=== Modifications for assessing immigrant assimilation === . 

Studies on immigrant assimilation in the 19th century and 20th century conclude that immigrants had a hard time catching up to the same human capital characteristics as native-born people in the 19th century, but studies in the 20th century suggest that immigrants eventually catch up to native born people. <ref name="United States Census Bureau">{{Cite journal |United States Census Bureau. |title=20th Century Statistics|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/99pubs/99statab/sec31.pdf }}</ref> Timothy J. Hatton explains this puzzle on [[immigrant]] assimilation in the 19th century and in the 20th century. He explores how recent studies have been producing misleading results between the two. Hatton focuses his research on the specification of the earnings function. Hatton argues that that specification of the earnings function should be improved in two ways. First, immigrants who arrived as children should be treated separately from those who arrived as adults. Second, specification of the earnings function should be better approximate to the true shape of age-earnings profiles. Hatton points out that with these modifications, the patterns of immigrant earnings, which have emerged make more sense with those of the 20th century and with traditional views on immigrant assimilation in the 19th century. <ref name="Hatton">{{Cite journal |last=Hatton |first=Timothy J. |title=The Immigrant Assimilation Puzzle in Late Nineteenth-Century America |journal=Journal of Economic History |volume=57 |issue=1 |year=1997 |pages=34–62 |doi=10.1017/S0022050700017915 }}</ref> . 

====Owning a home and immigrant assimilation==== . 

Owning a home can be seen as a step into assimilation. William A.V. Clark explores this link in his book "Immigrants and the American Dream Remarking the Middle Class". Clark is aware that the process of assimilation is more than just being able to purchase a home. He argues that "homeownership" is one of the steps of assimilation, it is becoming part of the [[community]] and a [[neighborhood]] and being a part of the daily activities that take place in a community. <ref name="Clark"/> . 

====Naturalization and immigrant assimilation==== . 

Other than marriage, [[citizenship]] is one of the most significant factors in assimilation. The immigration [[debate]] focuses not only on the number of immigrantson who should be admitted, and who should be allowed to be admitted but also on the processes of incorporation and, most importantly, how [[citizenship]] should be extended and to whom. For example, should it be extended to those who arrive illegally? Allowing for [[naturalization]] of immigrants can create tension in assimilation. On one hand, those who favor the admission of immigrants argue that these new residents will help build and enrich the American [[democratic]] process. However, others argue that the nature and [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the [[nation]] may be challenged and perhaps even threatened. <ref name="Clark"/> . 

====New immigrant gateways and immigrant assimilation====. 
Although it is changing, the overwhelming majority of immigrants still settle in [[traditional]] gateway states such as Florida, New York, California, Illinois, Texas, and Massachusetts. It has found that immigrants settle in [[traditional]] gateways where there are large populations of foreign-born people. Walters and Jimenez have illustrated the changes in the [[geographic]] distribution and the rates of growth of immigration in the [[United States]]. They show the number of foreign-born individuals in states where the foreign-born population grew by a factor of two or more between 1990 and 2000. Walters and Jimenez found that the largest percentage growth in the foreign-born population, was found in either the [[Midwest]] or the [[South]] in additional none of the traditional gateways were included in this large percentage growth. Walters and Jimenez noted that a reason these [[traditional]] gateways did not have an increase at the same rate of the new gateways was because, new gateways did not have many immigrants to begin with.  . 

Walters and Jimenez have argued that this new change in [[geography]] could possibly change the way researchers assess immigrant assimilation. They argue that these new gateways are unique and they propose that immigrant assimilation may be different from the experiences of immigrants in more traditional gateways in at least three ways.  . 

Firstly, the long history of immigration in these established gateways means that the place of immigrants in terms of [[Social class|class]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]], and [[ethnic]] hierarchies in these traditional gateways are more structured or established on the other hand these new gateways do not have much immigration [[history]] therefore the place of immigrants in terms of class, racial, and ethnic hierarchies is less defined and immigrants may have more influence to define their position. Secondly, the size of new gateways may influence immigrant assimilation. Having a smaller gateway may influence the level of [[Racial segregation|segregation]] among immigrants and native-born people. Thirdly, the difference in institutional arrangements may influence immigrant assimilation. Traditional gateways, unlike new gateways, have many institutions set up to help immigrants such as legal aid, bureaus, social organizations. Finally, Walters and Jimenez have only speculated that these differences may influence immigrant assimilation and the way researchers should assess immigrant assimilation. <ref name="Waters"/> .
