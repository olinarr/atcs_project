'''[[Multiculturalism]] in the Netherlands''' began with a major increases in immigration during the 1950s and 1960s. As a consequence, an official national policy of multiculturalism was adopted in the early 1980s. This policy subsequently gave way to more assimilationist policies in the 1990s. Following the murders of [[Pim Fortuyn]] (in 2002) and [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] (in 2004) the political debate on the role of multiculturalism in the Netherlands reached new heights.  . 

[[Lord Sacks]], Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, distinguishes between tolerance and multiculturalism, and says that the Netherlands is a tolerant, rather than multicultural, society. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12381027 |date=7 February 2011 |title=Multiculturalism: What does it mean? |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}</ref> . 

The current [[Rutte cabinet|right-wing cabinet]] recently said the Netherlands is going to take distance of Multicultural ideas about a multicultural society. "Dutch culture, norms and values must be dominant" [[Piet Hein Donner|Minister Donner]] said. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.elsevier.nl/web/Nieuws/Politiek/300160/Donner-Afscheid-van-multiculturele-samenleving-Nederland.htm |date=16 June 2011 |title=Donner: Afscheid van multiculturele samenleving Nederland |newspaper=[[Elsevier]]}}</ref> . 

==Immigration and opposition to it==. 
After World War II there were three successive waves of major immigration into the Netherlands. <ref name="SSVH">{{cite journal |title=Attitudes toward multiculturalism of immigrants and majority members in the Netherlands |author=Saskia R.G. Schalk-Soekar, Fons J.R. van de Vijver and Mariëtte Hoogsteder |journal=International Journal of Intercultural Relations |volume=28 |issue=6 |month=November |year=2004 |pages=533–550 |doi=10.1016/j.ijintrel.2005.01.009}}</ref> The first originated in the former Dutch colonies (such as Indonesia, Surinam and the Dutch Antilles) in the 1950s and 1960s. The second wave originated in Southern Europe (Greece, Italy, Spain, and Portugal) and arrived during the mid-1950s, and from Turkey and Morocco during the 1960s. These waves were in the form of labour migration. The third wave consisted of refugees from former East Block countries (such as Hungary) who immigrated since the 1970s and from different countries such as Iran, Iraq, and former Yugoslavia since the mid-1980s.  . 

Multiculturalism was adopted as a policy by the Netherlands in the 1980s. <ref name="SSVH"/> In 1983 a "Ethnic Minorities Policy" was adopted. <ref>{{cite journal |title=From ethnic minorities to ethnic majority policy: Multiculturalism and the shift to assimilationism in the Netherlands |journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies |volume=30 |issue=5 |year=2007 |pages=713–740 |author=Ellie Vasta |doi=10.1080/01419870701491770}}</ref> The anti-immigration [[Centre Party (Netherlands)|Centrumpartij]] had occasional electoral successes since 1982, but its leader [[Hans Janmaat]] was [[ostracism|ostracized]], and fined for his discriminatory statements and promotion of ethnic cleansing. <ref>[http://geschiedenis.vpro.nl/programmas/2899536/afleveringen/41837283/items/41872643/ ''Weg met de Centrumpartij'' - Epiloog]</ref> . 

The Netherlands has now attracted international attention for the extent to which it reversed its previous multiculturalist policies, and its policies on cultural assimilation have been described as the toughest in Europe. <ref>Economist: ''[http://www.economist.com/agenda/displayStory.cfm?story_id=8325991&fsrc=RSS Islam in Europe: Hostility at home]''; IHT: ''[http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/16/news/islam1.php Dutch virtue of tolerance under strain]''; IHT: ''[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/09/08/opinion/idlede9.php The Dutch redefine tolerance]''; Al-Ahram: [http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/717/in1.htm How Holland lost its innocence]; PBS: [http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/religion/july-dec04/dutchmuslims_11-4.htm A test of tolerance: Muslim immigrants in the Netherlands]''</ref> . 

==Demand for unskilled labour==. 
The multicultural policy consensus regarded the presence of immigrant cultural communities as non-problematic, or beneficial. Immigration was not subject to limits on cultural grounds: in practice, the immigration rate was determined by demand for unskilled labour, and later by migration of family members. Gross non-Western immigration was about three million, but many of these later returned. <ref name=bevolking>[http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?VW=T&DM=SLNL&PA=37296ned&D1=25,27-30&D2=l&HD=081103-1409 CBS StatLine - Bevolking; kerncijfers naar diverse kenmerken<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Net immigration, and the higher birth rate of the immigrant communities, have transformed the Netherlands since the 1950s. Although the majority are still ethnic Dutch, in 2006 one fifth of the population was of non-Dutch ethnicity, about half of which were of non-Western origin. <ref name=bevolking/> Immigration transformed Dutch cities especially: in Amsterdam, 55% of young people are of non-Western origin (mainly Turkish and Moroccan).{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} . 

==Intellectual critique==. 
In 1999, the [[philosophy of law|legal philosopher]] [[Paul Cliteur]] attacked multiculturalism in his book ''The Philosophy of Human Rights''. <ref>Paul Cliteur. De filosofie van mensenrechten. Nijmegen 1999. </ref> Cliteur rejects all [[political correctness]] on the issue: Western culture, the ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'' (rule of law), and [[human rights]] are superior to non-Western culture and values. They are the product of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Cliteur sees non-Western cultures not as merely different but as anachronistic. He sees multiculturalism primarily as an unacceptable ideology of [[cultural relativism]], which would lead to acceptance of barbaric practices, including those brought to the Western World by immigrants. Cliteur lists [[infanticide]], [[torture]], [[slavery]], oppression of women, [[homophobia]], racism, anti-Semitism, [[gangs]], [[female genital cutting]], discrimination ''by'' immigrants, [[suttee]], and the [[death penalty]]. Cliteur compares multiculturalism to the moral acceptance of [[Auschwitz]], [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Pol Pot]] and the [[Ku Klux Klan]].  . 

Cliteur's 1999 work is indicative of the [[polemic]] tone of the debate in the following years. Most of the "immigrant barbarities" which he names are regularly cited by opponents of multiculturalism, sometimes as a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', but also as factual practices of immigrants in the Netherlands.  . 

In 2000, [[Paul Scheffer]] — a member of the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] and subsequently a professor of [[urban studies]] — published his essay "The multicultural tragedy",<ref>Online at NRC, see [http://www.nrc.nl/W2/Lab/Multicultureel/scheffer.html]. An English translation is available at [http://themulticulturaltragedy.blogspot.com/]</ref> an essay critical of both [[immigration]] and multiculturalism. Scheffer is a committed supporter of the [[nation-state]], assuming that homogeneity and integration are necessary for a society: the presence of immigrants undermines this. A society does have a finite "absorptive capacity" for those from other cultures, he says, but this has been exceeded in the Netherlands. Specifically:
*a huge influx of people from diverse cultural backgrounds, in combination with multiculturalism, resulted in spontaneous ethnic segregation. 
*the Netherlands must take its ''own'' language, culture, and history seriously, and immigrants must learn this language, culture, and history. 
*multiculturalism and immigration led to adaptation problems such as school drop-out, unemployment, and high crime rates. 
*a society which does not respect itself (its Dutch national identity) also has no value for immigrants
*multicultural policy ignored [[Dutch language]] acquisition, which should be a priority in education. 
*Islam has not yet [[Age of Enlightenment|reform]]ed itself, and does not accept the [[separation of church and state]]. Some Muslims did not accept the law in [[Amsterdam]] because its mayor was Jewish. 
*immigrants must always lose their own culture - that is the price of immigration, a "brutal bargain" (quote from [[Norman Podhoretz]]).  . 

Scheffer approvingly quoted the Dutch sociologist J.A.A. van Doorn as saying that the presence of immigrants in the Netherlands had "put the clock back" by 100 or 150 years. The high immigration rate and the lack of integration threatened society, and must be stopped. His essay had a great impact, and led to what became known as the "integration debate". As in the essay, this was not simply about multiculturalism, but about immigration, Islam, the national identity, and national unity. <ref>Scheffer P., ''Immigrant Nations'' (Polity, 2011) ISBN 978-0745649610; English-language version of his 2007 book</ref> . 

In 2002, the legal scholar [[Afshin Ellian]],  a refugee from Iran, advocated a monocultural ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'' in the Netherlands. <ref>Afshin Ellian. 'Leve de monoculturele Rechtsstaat' in NRC, 30 November 2002. </ref> A liberal democracy cannot be multicultural, he argued, because multiculturalism is an [[ideology]] and a democracy has no official ideology. What is more, according to Ellian, a [[democracy]] must be [[monolingualism|monolingual]]. The [[Dutch language]] is the language of the [[constitution]], and therefore it must be the only public language — all others must be limited to the private sphere. The Netherlands, he wrote, had been taken hostage by the left-wing multiculturalists, and their policy was in turn determined by the Islamic conservatives. Ellian stated that there were 800 000 Muslims in the country, with 450 mosques, and that the Netherlands had legalised the "feudal system of the Islamic Empire". Democracy and the rule of law could only be restored by abolishing multiculturalism.  . 

==Political reaction==. 
{{Main|Multiculturalism and Islam}}
Overturning the political stability of the 1990s, Fortuyn came close to being [[prime minister]] of the Netherlands. <ref>[http://web.planet.nl/news/verkiezingen/2dekamer2002/nieuws/intomartfortuyn.shtml Opinion poll prediction]{{Dead link|date=November 2008}}</ref> He was assassinated during the [[Dutch general election, 2002|2002 Dutch national election campaign]] by a militant animal rights activist [[Volkert van der Graaf]], who claimed in court to murdering Fortuyn to stop him exploiting Muslims as "scapegoats" and targeting "the weak parts of society to score points" in seeking political power. <ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/1425944/Fortuyn-killed-to-protect-Muslims.html   Fortuyn killed 'to protect Muslims'] (The Telegraph)</ref> His supporters saw him as a national [[martyr]] in the struggle against islamisation.  . 

Following Fortuyn's death, open rejection of multiculturalism and immigration ceased to be [[taboo]]. The new cabinet, under premier [[Jan-Peter Balkenende]] instituted a hard-line assimilation policy, enforced by fines and [[deportation]], accompanied by far tighter controls on immigration and [[Right of asylum|asylum]]. Many former supporters of multiculturalism shifted their position. In a 2006 manifesto "one country, one society",<ref>[http://www.eenlandeensamenleving.nl/ Een land, een samenleving]</ref> several of them launched an appeal for a homogeneous society.  . 

==Feminist opposition==. 
The most prominent figure in the post-Fortuyn debate of the issue was [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]]. Her first criticisms of multiculturalism paralleled those of the early [[liberal feminism|liberal-feminist]] critics in the United States — the emphasis on group identity and [[group rights]] diminished individual liberty for those within the minorities, and especially for women. As time went on, her criticism was increasingly directed at Islam itself, and its incompatibility with democracy and Western culture. By 2004 she was the most prominent critic of [[Islam in Europe]]. When she scripted a short film on Islamic oppression of women, featuring texts from the [[Quran]] on the naked bodies of women, its director [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] was assassinated by [[Mohammed Bouyeri]]. Threatened with death and heavily guarded, she spent most of her time in the United States, and moved to Washington in 2006 to work for the [[American Enterprise Institute]]. In 2006, she also expressed support for the [[Eurabia]] thesis — that Europe is being fully [[Islamisation|Islamised]] —, and that its non-Muslim inhabitants will be reduced to [[dhimmitude]]. <ref>''[http://ayaanhirsiali.web-log.nl/ayaanhirsiali/2006/04/ayaan_confronta.html Confrontatie, geen verzoening]'' in De Volkskrant, 8 April 2006. </ref> In a speech for [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]] in January 2007, she declared that Western culture was overwhelmingly superior: . 

<blockquote> ... my dream is that those lucky enough to be born into a culture of "ladies first" will let go of the myth that all cultures are equal. Human beings are equal; cultures are not. <ref>[[American Enterprise Institute]] ''[http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.25476,filter.all/pub_detail.asp Ladies First]', speech by Ayaan Hirsi Ali to the Congress of Racial Equality. </ref></blockquote> . 

==Patriotic measures==. 
Some of the measures, especially those seeking to promote patriotic identification, include: In the Netherlands, the naturalisation ceremony includes a gift symbolising national unity. In [[Gouda]] it is a candle in the national colours red-white-blue, in [[Amsterdam]] a [[Delftware]] potato with floral motifs. <ref>''Nieuwe Amsterdammer krijgt Delfts blauw bij naturalisatie'', De Volkskrant, 24 August 2006. </ref> . 

There are proposed measures which go much further than these. They typically, but not always, come from firmly [[right-wing]] parties and their supporters. Although implementation is not on the political agenda in any EU state, the proposals illustrate the "post-multicultural" climate: a loyalty oath for all citizens, legal prohibition of public use of a foreign language, cessation of all immigration, [[European Union withdrawal|withdrawal from the European Union]], a compulsory (non-military) [[national service]];<ref>[[Pim Fortuyn]] in 'De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars', see '[http://www.nrc.nl/binnenland/article1649240.ece/Politiek_worstelt_al_jaren_met_lastige_jongeren Politiek worstelt al jaren met lastige jongeren]'</ref> in rare cases a ban on the construction of mosques,<ref>[[Geert Wilders]], parliamentary question, in Dutch: [http://www.geertwilders.nl/joomla/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=281#search=%22moskeeen%20verbod%22]{{Dead link|date=November 2008}}. Also policy of the [[Party for the Netherlands]] of [[Hilbrand Nawijn]] {{cite web |url=http://www.hilbrand-nawijn.nl/c_news.asp?nummer=557 |title=De 25 kernpunten uit het programma van Partij voor Nederland |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070312113228/http://www.hilbrand-nawijn.nl/c_news.asp?nummer=557 |archivedate=2007-03-12}}</ref> closure of all Islamic schools,<ref>Policy of the [[Party for the Netherlands]] of [[Hilbrand Nawijn]] {{cite web |url=http://www.hilbrand-nawijn.nl/c_news.asp?nummer=557 |title=De 25 kernpunten uit het programma van Partij voor Nederland |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070312113228/http://www.hilbrand-nawijn.nl/c_news.asp?nummer=557 |archivedate=2007-03-12}}</ref> or a complete ban on Islam.  . 

The [[Party for Freedom]] of anti-immigration politician [[Geert Wilders]] opposed the nomination of two ministers because they had [[dual nationality]]. The party subsequently proposed a [[motion of no confidence]] in both ministers. The party doubts their loyalty to the Netherlands, in cases of conflict with their countries of origin ([[Turkey]] and [[Morocco]]). <ref>Expatica: "[http://www.expatica.com/nl/articles/news/dual-nationality-fuss-unnecessary-36868.html Dual nationality fuss unnecessary]", 23 February 2007. </ref>  According to an opinion poll more than half the population agrees with the party. <ref>Trouw: "[http://www.trouw.nl/nieuws/laatstenieuws/article1458100.ece Helft Nederlanders oneens met dubbele nationaliteit]."</ref> Opinion is sharply divided by political party: 96% of Wilders' voters agree with him, and 93% of [[GreenLeft]] voters disagree.  . 

==Likelihood of polarization==. 
Although such policies often have the stated aim of reviving national unity, one result has been an increased [[polarization (politics)|polarization]]. <ref>"All the recent evidence shows that we are, as a society, becoming more socially polarized by race and faith." (Trevor Phillips). Guardian, October 23, 2006: ''[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2006/oct/23/schools.race Muslim veil debate could start riots, warns Phillips]''</ref> Muslims in Britain or the Netherlands may occasionally hear that their culture is backward, that Western culture is superior, and that they are obliged to adopt it. In turn, overly-defensive reactions<ref>Foreign Policy Centre.[http://fpc.org.uk/fsblob/792.pdf Born in the UK: Young Muslims in Britain]{{Dead link|date=November 2008}}'. </ref> include an increased self-identification as "Muslims", and adoption of [[hijab|Islamic dress]] by women and "Islamic" beards by men. Part of the Muslim minority is now hostile to the society they live in, and sympathetic to [[terrorism]]. <ref>''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4744865.stm Bin Laden is seen as a hero],'' BBC</ref>
In Amsterdam's secondary schools, about half the Moroccan minority does not identify with the Netherlands: they see their identity as "Muslim", and regularly express [[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-Western]] views but, nevertheless, do not want to return to their historical homeland. <ref>City of Amsterdam policy document, February 2006. ''Wij Amsterdammers II: investeren in mensen en grenzen.''</ref> . 

==New terms for minorities==. 
New terms for minorities of immigrant descent have come into use: the term [[allochtoon]] in Flanders (Dutch speaking part of Belgium) and the Netherlands. Both are applied regardless of [[citizenship]]. The renewed emphasis on historical culture places higher demands on cultural assimilation; immigrants may be encouraged to learn, for example, to identify and describe [[culture hero|cultural heroes]] and historical figures such as [[Thorbecke]] and
[[William the Silent|William of Orange]]. <ref>Both came second, in polls to find the Greatest Briton and the Greatest Netherlander. Winston Churchill beat Brunel, and Pim Fortuyn beat William of Orange. BBC reports [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2509465.stm] and [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4015173.stm]. </ref> .
