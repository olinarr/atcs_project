'''Polyethnicity''' refers to the close proximity of people from different ethnic backgrounds within a [[country]] or other specific geographic region. <ref name=mcneil85>McNeil 1985, page 85</ref> It also relates to the ability and willingness of individuals to identify themselves with multiple [[ethnic group|ethnicities]]. It occurs when multiple [[ethnicity|ethnicities]] inhabit a given area, specifically through means of [[immigration]], [[Interracial marriage|intermarriage]], [[trade]], [[conquest (military)|conquest]], and post-war land-divisions. <ref name=arabandi>Arabandi 2000, Online</ref><ref name=smith190>Smith 1998, page 190</ref><ref name=smith200>Smith 1998, page 200</ref> [[William Hardy McNeill|Professor William H. McNeill]] states in his series of lectures on polyethnicity that it is the societal norm for cultures to be made up of many ethnic groups. <ref name=dr2>Dreisziger 1990 page 1</ref> This has had many political and social implications on countries and regions. <ref name=safranintro>Safran 2000, Introduction</ref><ref name=benhabib154-155>Benhabib 1996, pages 154-155</ref>  . 

Many, if not all, countries have some level of polyethnicity, with countries like the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] having large levels and countries like [[Japan]]
and [[Poland]] having relatively small levels (and more specifically, a sense of homogeneity). <ref name=usb>U.S. Census Bureau</ref><ref name=thomson213-215>Thomson 2000, pages 213-215</ref><ref name=Burgess>Burgess 2007, Online</ref><ref name=safran1-2>Safran 2000, pages 1-2</ref> The amount of polyethnicity prevalent in current society has spurred some arguments against it, which include a belief that it leads to the weakening of each societies strengths, and also a belief that political-ethnic issues in countries with polyethnic populations are better handled with different laws for certain ethnicities. <ref name=robertson1-10>Robertson 1992, pages 1-10</ref><ref name=thomson214-215>Thomson 2000, pages 214-215</ref> . 

== Conceptual history == . 

In 1985 Professor William H. McNeill, a Canadian historian known for his expertise on the subject of polyethnicity, gave a series of three lectures on polyethnicity in ancient and modern cultures at the [[University of Toronto]]. <ref name=ritzer141>Ritzer 2004, page 141</ref> The main thesis throughout the lectures was that it has been the [[Norm (sociology)|cultural norm]] for societies to be made up of different ethnic groups. McNeill states that the ideal of homogeneous societies may have grown between 1750 and 1920 in [[Western Europe]] due to a growth in the belief in a single [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] base for the political organization of society. McNeill believes that [[World War I]] was the point in time when the desire for homogeneous nations began to weaken. <ref name=dr>Dreisziger 1990, pages 1-2</ref> . 

== Impact on politics ==. 
Polyethnicity divides nations, complicating the [[politics]] as local and national governments attempt to satisfy all [[ethnic groups]]. <ref name=safranintro/> Many [[politician]]s in countries attempt to find the balance between [[ethnic group|ethnic identities]] within their country and the identity of the nation as a whole. <ref name=safranintro/> Nationalism also plays a large part in these political debates, as [[cultural pluralism]] and [[consociationalism]] are the [[democratic]] alternatives to nationalism for the polyethnic state. <ref name=kellas8>Kellas 1991, page 8</ref> The idea of nationalism being social instead of ethnic entails a variety of culture, a shared sense of identity, and a community not based on descent. <ref name=kellas65>Kellas 1991, page 65</ref> Culturally plural states vary constitutionally between a decentralized and unitary state (such as [[Great Britain]]) and a federal state (such as Belgium, [[Switzerland]], or Canada). <ref name=kellas180-183>Kellas 1991, pages 180-183</ref> Ethnic parties in these polyethnic regions are not anti-state but instead seek maximum power within this state. <ref name=robertson1-10/><ref name=kellas65/> Many polyethnic countries face this dilemma with their policy decisions. <ref name=safran2-3>Safran 2000, pages 2-3</ref> The following nations and regions are just a few specific examples of this dilemma and its effects.  . 

=== United States ===.

</div>
The [[United States]] is a nation founded by different ethnicities coming together in a [[melting pot]]. <ref name=adams>Adams 2001</ref> A controversial political issue in recent years has been the question of [[multilingualism|bilingualism]]. <ref name=oakland>Navarrette 2007, online</ref> Many [[immigration|immigrants]] have come from [[Hispanic America]], who are native [[Spanish language|Spanish]] speakers, in the past centuries and have become a significant minority and even a majority in many areas of the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]]. <ref name=usb/><ref name=languages>Hakimzadeh 2007, Online</ref> In [[New Mexico]] the Spanish speaking population exceeds 40%. <ref name=usb/><ref>Crawford 1992, page 154</ref>
Disputes have emerged over language policy, since a sizable part of the population, and in many areas the majority of the population, speak Spanish as a native language. <ref name=oakland>Navarrette 2007, online</ref> The biggest debates are over bilingual education for language minority students, the availability of non-English ballots and election materials, and whether or not English is the official language. <ref name=oakland>Navarrette 2007, online</ref><ref>Cromwell 1998, Online</ref><ref>Roache 1996, Online</ref> It has evolved into an [[ethnic conflict]] between the pluralists who support bilingualism and linguistic access and the assimilationists who strongly oppose this and lead the [[English-only movement|official English movement]]. <ref name=young73>Young 1993, page 73</ref>
The United States does not have an [[official language]], but English is the [[de facto]] national language. <ref name=mcarthur38>McArthur 1998, page 38</ref> . 

=== Canada ===. 
[[Canada]] has had many political debates between the [[French language|French]] speakers and [[English language|English]] speakers, particularly in the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[Quebec]]. <ref name=belanger>Bélanger 2000, online</ref> Canada holds both French and English as official languages. <ref name=tuohy325>Tuohy 1992, page 325</ref> The politics in Quebec are largely defined by [[nationalism]] as French [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]] wish to gain independence from Canada as a whole, based on ethnic and linguistic boundaries. <ref name=mcneil86>McNeil 1985, page 86</ref>
The main separatist party, [[Parti Québécois]], attempted to gain sovereignty twice (once in [[Quebec independence referendum, 1980|1980]] and again in [[Quebec independence referendum, 1995|1995]]) and failed by a narrow margin of 1.2% in 1995. <ref name=leyton>Leyton-Brown 2002, page 5</ref> Since then, in order to remain united, Canada granted Quebec [[Quebec#Statut_particulier_.28.22special_status.22.29|''statut particulier'']], recognizing Quebec as a nation within the united nation of Canada. <ref name=calgary>The Calgary Declaration</ref> . 

=== Belgium ===. 
The divide between the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking north ([[Flanders]]) and the [[French language|French]]-speaking South ([[Wallonia]]) has caused the [[parliamentary democracy]] to become ethnically polarized. <ref name=lj39>Lijphart 199, page 39</ref> Though an equal number of seats in the [[Chamber of Representatives of Belgium|Chamber of Representatives]] are prescribed to the Flemish and Walloons, Belgian [[political parties]] have all divided into two [[Ideology|ideologically]] identical but linguistically and ethnically different parties. <ref name=lj39/> The political crisis has grown so bad in recent years that the [[partition of Belgium]] has been feared. <ref name=sfchronicle>Bryant, Online</ref> . 

=== Ethiopia ===. 
[[Ethiopia]] is a polyethnic [[nation]] consisting of 80 different [[ethnic group]]s and 84 [[indigenous language]]s. <ref name=levinson131>Levinson 1998, page 131</ref><ref name=ethnologue>Grimes 1996</ref> Due to the diverse population and rural areas throughout the nation, it was nearly impossible to create a strong centralized state; though it was eventually accomplished through political evolution. <ref name=young147>Young 1993, page 147</ref> Prior to 1974, nationalism was only discussed within radical student groups, but by the late 20th century the issue had come to the forefront of political debate. <ref name=tiruneh>Tiruneh 1993, page 150</ref><ref name=young149>Young 1993, page 149</ref> Ethiopia was forced to modernize their political system to properly handle the nationalism debates. <ref name=young149/> The [[Derg]] military regime took control with a [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] ideology, urging [[self-determination]] and rejecting compromise over any nationality issues. <ref name=young152>Young 1993, page 152</ref> In the 1980s, Ethiopia suffered a series of famines and after the [[USSR]] broke apart, they lost their aid from the [[Soviet Union]] and the Derg regime collapsed. <ref name=young152>Young 1993, page 152</ref>  Eventually Ethiopia restabilized and adopted a modern political system that models a [[federal parliamentary republic]]. <ref name=kavalski>Kavalski 2008, page 31</ref> It was still impossible to create a central government holding all power, so the government was torn. <ref name=young159>Young 1993, page 159</ref> The central federal government now presides over ethnically-based regional states and each ethnic state is granted the right to establish their own government and [[democracy]]. <ref name=young209>Young 1993, page 209</ref> . 

=== 19th Century Spain ===. 
In [[Spain]] from 1808-1814 the [[Peninsular War#Guerrilla war|Spanish War of Independence]] took place amidst a multi-cultural Spain. <ref name=baramendi>Baramendi 2000, pages 80-84</ref> Spain, at the time, was under the control of [[Joseph Bonaparte|King Joseph]], who was [[Napoleon I of France]]'s brother. <ref name=baramendi/> Because the nation was under the control of French rule, the Spanish formed [[coalition]]s of ethnic groups to reclaim their own political representation, instead of the current French political system in power. <ref name=baramendi/> . 

=== Southeast Asia ===. 
[[File:Location Southeast Asia.svg|left|thumb|Southeast Asia countries, 2009-10-10]]
In [[Southeast Asia]] the continental area ([[Myanmar]], [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Vietnam]]) generally practices [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]]. <ref name=hirschman19>Hirschman 1995 page 19</ref> Most of [[Island|insular]] Southeast Asia (namely [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]] and [[Indonesia]]) practices mostly [[Sunni Islam]]. <ref name=hirschman20>Hirschman 1995 page 20</ref> The rest of the insular region ([[Philippines]] and [[East Timor]]) practices mostly [[Roman Catholic|Roman Catholic Christianity]] and [[Singapore]] practises mostly [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]]. <ref name=hirschman20>Hirschman 1995 page 20</ref> Significant long-distance labor migration that occurred during the late 19th into the early 20th century provided many different types of ethnic diversity. <ref name=hirschman21>Hirschman 1995 page 21</ref> Relations between the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] population of the region arose from regional variations of cultural and linguistic group. <ref name=hirschman21/> During this time immigrant minorities, especially the Chinese, developed as well. <ref name=hirschman21/> Although there were extreme political differences for each minority and religion, they were still legitimate members of political communities and there has been a significant amount of unity throughout history. <ref name=hirschman22>Hirschman 1995 page 22</ref> This differs from both nearby [[East Asia|East]] and [[South Asia]]. <ref name=hirschman22/> . 

== Impact on society ==. 
Polyethnicity, over time, can change the way societies practice [[Norm (sociology)|cultural norms]]. <ref name=benhabib154-155/> . 

=== Marriage ===. 
An increase in intermarriage in the United States has led to the blurring of ethnic lines. <ref name=arabandi/> [[Anti-miscegenation laws]] (laws banning interracial marriages) were abolished in the United States in 1967 and now it is estimated that one-fifth of the population in the United States by 2050 will be part of the polyethnic population. <ref name=lee221-245>Lee 2000, pages 221-245</ref> In 2000, self-identified Multiracial Americans numbered 6.8 million or 2.4% of the population. <ref name=usb/><ref name=jonessmith>Jones & Smith 2000 Online</ref>
While the number of interethnic marriages is on the rise, there are certain ethnic groups that have been found more likely to become polyethnic and recognize themselves with more than one ethnic background. Bhavani Arabandi states in his article on polyethnicity that:<blockquote>
Asians and Latinos have much higher rates of interethnic marriages than do blacks, and they are more likely to report polyethnicity than blacks who more often claim a single ethnicity and racial identity. This is the case, the authors [Lee, J & Bean, F.D] argue, because blacks have a "legacy of slavery," a history of discrimination, and have been victimized by the "one drop rule" (where having any black blood automatically labeled one as black) in the US. <ref name=arabandi/>
</blockquote> . 

=== Military ===. 
[[File:US ARMY AFRICA NF10 0016.jpg|thumb|Maj. Gen. William B. Garrett III, commander of U.S. Army Africa, Gen. Nyakayirima Aronda, Chief of Defense Forces, Ugandan People’s Defense Force, and Gen. Jeremiah Kianga, Chief of General Staff, Kenya, render honors during the opening ceremony for Natural Fire 10, Kitgum, Uganda, Oct. 16, 2009.]]
Presently, most armed forces are composed of people from different ethnic backgrounds. <ref name=dr/> They are considered to be polyethnic due to the differences in race, ethnicity, language or background. <ref name=dr2/> While there are many examples of polyethnic forces, the most prominent are among the largest armed forces in the world, including those of the United States, [[Soviet Union|the former USSR]], and [[China]]. <ref name=dr/> Polyethnic armed forces are not a new phenomenon; multi-ethnic forces have been in existence since the ancient [[Roman Empire]], [[Middle Eastern Empires]] and even the [[List of Mongol Khans|Mongol Khans]]. <ref name=dr2/> The [[United States armed forces|U.S. Military]] was one of the first modern militaries to begin ethnic integration, by order of [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]] in 1945. <ref name=yang>Yang 2000, page 168</ref> . 

== Criticisms ==. 
There are also arguments against polyethnicity, as well as the assimilation of ethnicities in polyethnic regions. [[Wilmot Robertson]] in ''The Ethnostate'' and [[Dennis L. Thomson]] in ''The Political Demands of Isolated Indian Bands in British Columbia'', argue for some level of [[separatism]]. <ref name=robertson1-10/><ref name=thomson214-215/> . 

In ''The Ethnostate'', Robertson declares polyethnicity as an ideal that only lessens each culture. <ref name=robertson1-10/> He believes that, within a polyethnic culture, the nation or region as a whole is less capable of cultural culmination than each of the individual ethnicities that make it up. <ref name=robertson10>Robertson 1992 p. 10</ref> Essentially, polyethnicity promotes the dilution of ethnicity and thus hinders each ethnicity in all aspects of culture. <ref name=robertson10>Robertson 1992 p. 10</ref> . 

In ''The Political Demands of Isolated Indian Bands in British Columbia'', Thomson points out the benefits in some level (albeit small) of separatist policies. <ref name=thomson214-215/> He argues the benefits of allowing ethnic groups, like the [[Amish]] and the [[Hutterite]]s in the United States and Canada or the [[Sami people|Sami]] in [[Norway]], to live on the edges of governance. <ref name=thomson214-215/> These are ethnic groups that would prefer to retain their ethnic identity and thus prefer separatist policies for themselves, as they do not require them to conform to policies for all ethnicities of the nation. <ref name=thomson214-215/> .
