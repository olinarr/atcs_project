'''Individualism''' is the [[moral]] stance, [[political philosophy]], ideology, or social outlook that stresses "the moral worth of the [[individual]]". <ref name="britannica.com">http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/286303/individualism "Individualism" on Encyclopædia Britannica Online</ref> Individualists promote the exercise of one's goals and desires and so value [[independence]] and [[self-reliance]]<ref name="thefreedictionary.com">http://www.thefreedictionary.com/individualism "individualism" on The Free Dictionary</ref> while opposing external interference upon one's own interests by [[society]] or other [[institutions]] such as the government. <ref name="thefreedictionary.com"/> . 

Individualism makes the individual its focus<ref name="britannica.com"/> and so starts "with the fundamental premise that the human individual is of primary importance in the struggle for liberation." [[Classical liberalism]] (including [[libertarianism]]), [[existentialism]] and [[anarchism]] (especially [[individualist anarchism]]) are examples of movements that take the human individual as a central unit of analysis. <ref name="ReferenceA">[[L. Susan Brown]]. ''[[The Politics of Individualism: Liberalism, Liberal Feminism, and Anarchism]]''. BLACK ROSE BOOKS LID. 1993</ref> . 

It has also been used as a term denoting "The quality of being an individual; individuality"<ref name="thefreedictionary.com"/> related to possessing "An individual characteristic; a [[Idiosyncrasy|quirk]]."<ref name="thefreedictionary.com"/> Individualism is thus also associated with [[art]]istic and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] interests and lifestyles where there is a tendency towards self creation and experimentation as opposed to tradition or popular mass opinions and behaviors<ref name="thefreedictionary.com"/><ref name="jstor.org">http://www.jstor.org/pss/2570771 Bohemianism: the underworld of Art by George S. Snyderman and William Josephs</ref> as so also with [[humanism|humanist]] philosophical positions and ethics. <ref>"The leading intellectual trait of the era was the recovery, to a certain degree, of the secular and humane philosophy of Greece and Rome. Another humanist trend which cannot be ignored was the rebirth of individualism, which, developed by Greece and Rome to a remarkable degree, had been suppressed by the rise of a caste system in the later Roman Empire, by the Church and by feudalism in the Middle Ages.[http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/humanism.html "The history guide: Lectures on Modern European Intellectual History"]</ref><ref>"Anthropocentricity and individualism...Humanism and Italian art were similar in giving paramount attention to human experience, both in its everyday immediacy and in its positive or negative extremes...The human-centredness of Renaissance art, moreover, was not just a generalized endorsement of earthly experience.

== Etymology ==. 
In the [[English language]], the word "individualism" was first introduced, as a pejorative, by the [[Owenism|Owenites]] in the late 1830s, although it is unclear if they were influenced by [[Saint-Simonianism]] or came up with it independently. <ref name="Claeys">{{cite journal|author=Claeys, Gregory |authorlink=Gregory Claeys |title="Individualism," "Socialism," and "Social Science": Further Notes on a Process of Conceptual Formation, 1800-1850 |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas  |year=1986 |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=81–93 |doi=10.2307/2709596|jstor=2709596|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press}}</ref> A more positive use of the term in Britain came to be used with the writings of [[James Elishama Smith]], who was a [[millenarian]] and a [[Christian Israelite]]. Although an early Owenite socialist, he eventually rejected its collective idea of property, and found in individualism a "universalism" that allowed for the development of the "original genius." Without individualism, Smith argued, individuals cannot amass property to increase one's happiness. <ref name="Claeys"/> [[William Maccall]], another [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] preacher, and probably an acquaintance of Smith, came somewhat later, although influenced by [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], and [[Romanticism|German Romanticism]], to the same positive conclusions, in his 1847 work "Elements of Individualism". <ref name="Swart">{{cite journal|author=Swart, Koenraad W. |title="Individualism" in the Mid-Nineteenth Century (1826-1860) |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas  |year=1962 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=77–90 |doi=10.2307/2708058|jstor=2708058|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press}}</ref> . 

== The individual ==. 
{{Main|Individual}}
As [[vernacular|commonly used]], an individual is a [[person]] or any specific object in a collection. In the 15th century and earlier, and also today within the fields of [[statistics]] and [[metaphysics]], individual means "indivisible", typically describing any numerically singular thing, but sometimes meaning "a person." (q.v. "The problem of [[proper name]]s"). From the 17th century on, individual indicates separateness, as in individualism. <ref>Abbs 1986, cited in Klein 2005, pp.26-27</ref> Individuality is the state or quality of being an [[individual]]; a person separate from other persons and possessing his or her own needs, goals, and desires.  . 

== Individualism and society ==. 
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}
An individualist enters into society to further his or her own interests, or at least demands the ''right'' to serve his or her own interests, without taking the interests of society into consideration (an individualist need not be an [[egoist anarchism|egoist]]). The individualist does not lend credence to any philosophy that requires the sacrifice of the self-interest of the individual for any higher social causes. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] would argue, however, that his concept of "[[general will]]" in the "[[Social Contract (Rousseau)|social contract]]" is not the simple collection of individual wills and precisely furthers the interests of the individual (the constraint of [[law]] itself would be beneficial for the individual, as the lack of respect for the law necessarily entails, in Rousseau's eyes, a form of [[ignorance]] and submission to one's [[Passion (emotion)|passions]] instead of the preferred [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomy]] of [[reason]]).{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} . 

Societies and groups can differ in the extent to which they are based upon predominantly "self-regarding" (individualistic, and arguably self-interested) rather than "other-regarding" (group-oriented, and group, or society-minded) behavior.  [[Ruth Benedict]] made a distinction, relevant in this context, between [[Guilt society|"guilt" societies]] (e.g., [[medieval Europe]]) with an "internal reference standard", and [[Shame society|"shame" societies]] (e.g., [[Japan]], "bringing shame upon one's ancestors") as opposed to an "external reference standard", where people look to their peers for feedback on whether an action is "acceptable" or not (also known as "[[group-think]]").  . 

The extent to which society or groups are "individualistic" can vary from time to time, and from country to country.  For example, Japanese society is more group-oriented (e.g., decisions tend to be taken by consensus among groups, rather than by individuals), and it has been argued that "personalities are less developed" (than is usual in the West).{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Compare [[individualistic culture]].  . 

[[John Kenneth Galbraith]] made a classic distinction between "private affluence and public squalor" in the USA, and private squalor and public affluence in (for example) Europe, and there is a correlation between individualism and degrees of public-sector intervention and taxation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} . 

Individualism is often contrasted<ref>{{cite book|last=Hayek|first=F.A.|title=The Road to Serfdom|year=1994|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=United States of America|isbn=0-226-32061-8|pages=17, 37-48}}</ref>  either with [[totalitarianism]] or with [[collectivism]], but in fact there is a spectrum of behaviors at the societal level ranging from highly individualistic societies through mixed societies (a term the [[United Kingdom|UK]] has used{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} in the post-[[World War II]] period) to collectivist. Also, many collectivists (particularly supporters of [[collectivist anarchism]] or [[libertarian socialism]]) point to the enormous differences between liberty-minded collectivism and totalitarian practices.  . 

Individualism, sometimes closely associated with certain variants of [[anarchism]] or [[liberalism]], typically takes it for granted that individuals know best and that public authority or [[society]] has no right to interfere in the person's decision-making process, unless a very compelling need to do so arises (and maybe not even in those circumstances). This type of argument can occur in policy debates regarding regulation of industries, as well as in relation to personal choice of lifestyle.  . 

== Political individualism ==. 
{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=With the abolition of private property, then, we shall have true, beautiful, healthy Individualism.  Nobody will waste his life in accumulating things, and the symbols for things.  One will live.  To live is the rarest thing in the world.  Most people exist, that is all.|source=[[Oscar Wilde]],{{-}}''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]'', 1891}} . 

Individualists are chiefly concerned with protecting individual autonomy against obligations imposed by social institutions (such as the state or religious morality). For [[L. Susan Brown]] "[[Liberalism]] and [[anarchism]] are two political philosophies that are fundamentally concerned with [[individual]] [[Freedom of will|freedom]] yet differ from one another in very distinct ways. Anarchism shares with liberalism a radical commitment to individual freedom while rejecting liberalism's competitive property relations."<ref name="ReferenceA"/> . 

[[Civil liberties]] are [[rights]] and [[Political freedom|freedom]]s that provide an [[individual]] specific rights such as the freedom from slavery and forced labor, freedom from torture and death,  the right to liberty and security, right to a fair trial, the right to defend one's self, the right to own and bear arms, the right to privacy, freedom of conscience, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and association, and the right to marry and have a family. Within the distinctions between civil liberties and other types of liberty, it is important to note the distinctions between [[positive rights]] and [[negative rights]]. Common civil liberties include the rights of people, [[freedom of religion]], and [[freedom of speech]], and additionally, the right to [[due process]], to a [[Right to a fair trial|trial]] and to [[privacy]]. [[Civil libertarianism]] is a strain of political thought that supports [[civil liberties]], or which emphasizes the supremacy of [[individual rights]] and [[personal freedom]]s over and against any kind of authority (such as a [[State (polity)|state]], a [[corporation]], social norms imposed through [[peer pressure]], etc). <ref>http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/civil%20libertarian?r=14</ref> Civil libertarianism is not a complete [[ideology]]; rather, it is a collection of views on the specific issues of civil liberties and [[civil rights]]. Because of this, a civil libertarian outlook is compatible with many other political philosophies, and civil libertarianism is found on both the [[political right|right]] and [[political left|left]] in modern politics. <ref>http://politicalcompass.org/analysis2</ref> . 

=== Liberalism ===. 
{{Main|Liberalism}}
Liberalism (from the Latin ''liberalis'', "of freedom; worthy of a free man, gentlemanlike, courteous, generous")<ref>http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/lookup.pl?stem=liberalis&ending=</ref> is the belief in the importance of individual freedom.  This belief is widely accepted in the United States, Europe, Australia and other [[Western world|Western]] nations, and was recognized as an important value by many Western philosophers throughout history, in particular since [[the Enlightenment]]. It is often rejected by collectivist, Islamic, or [[confucian]] societies in Asia or the Middle East. The Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] wrote praising "the idea of a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, and the idea of a kingly government which respects most of all the freedom of the governed". <ref>Marcus Aurelius, ''Meditations'', Oxford University Press, 2008, ISBN 978-0-19-954059-4. </ref> . 

Modern liberalism has its roots in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and rejects many [[Foundationalism|foundational]] assumptions that dominated most earlier theories of government, such as the [[Divine Right of Kings]], hereditary status, and [[state religion|established religion]].  [[John Locke]] is often credited with the philosophical foundations of classical liberalism.  He wrote "no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions."<ref name = "locke">{{cite book | last = Locke | first = John | title = [[Two Treatises of Government]] (10th edition) | publisher = [[Project Gutenberg]] | year = 1690 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/trgov10h.htm | accessdate = January 21, 2009}}</ref> . 

In the 17th century, liberal ideas began to influence governments in Europe, in nations such as The Netherlands, Switzerland, England and Poland, but they were strongly opposed, often by armed might, by those who favored absolute monarchy and established religion.  In the 18th century, in America, the first modern liberal state was founded, without a monarch or a hereditary aristocracy. <ref>Paul E. Sigmund, editor, ''The Selected Political Writings of John Locke'', Norton, 2003, ISBN 0-393-96451-5 p. iv "(Locke's thoughts) underlie many of the fundamental political ideas of American liberal constitutional democracy...", "At the time Locke wrote, his principles were accepted in theory by a few and in practice by none."</ref>  The American ''Declaration of Independence'' includes the words (which echo Locke) "all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are [[life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness]]; that to insure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed."<ref>Thomas Jefferson, ''Declaration of Independence'', July 4, 1776. </ref> . 

Liberalism comes in many forms.  According to [[John N. Gray]], the essence of liberalism is toleration of different beliefs and of different ideas as to what constitutes a good life. <ref>John Gray, ''Two Faces of Liberalism'', The New Press, 2008, ISBN 978-1-56584-678-4</ref> .

These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of the socialism off Karl Marg."

For influential Italian anarchist [[Errico Malatesta]] "All anarchists, whatever tendency they belong to, are individualists in some way or other. But the opposite is not true; not by any means.

== Philosophical individualism ==. 
=== Ethical egoism ===. 
{{Main|Ethical egoism}}
Ethical egoism (also called simply egoism)<ref>Sanders, Steven M. Is egoism morally defensible? Philosophia. Springer Netherlands. Volume 18, Numbers 2&ndash;3 / July, 1988</ref> is the [[normative ethics|normative ethical]] position that [[moral agent]]s ought to do what is in their own [[wikt:self-interest|self-interest]].  It differs from [[psychological egoism]], which claims that [[people]] ''do'' only act in their self-interest.  Ethical egoism also differs from [[rational egoism]], which holds merely that it is [[rationality|rational]] to act in one's self-interest. These doctrines may, though, be combined with ethical egoism.  . 

Ethical egoism contrasts with ethical [[altruism (ethics)|altruism]], which holds that moral agents have an [[obligation]] to help and serve others. Egoism and altruism both contrast with ethical [[utilitarianism]], which holds that a moral agent should treat one's [[self (philosophy)|self]] (also known as [[subject (philosophy)|the subject]]) with no higher regard than one has for others (as egoism does, by elevating self-interests and "the self" to a status not granted to others), but that one also should not (as altruism does) sacrifice one's own interests to help others' interests, so long as one's own interests (i.e. one's own [[desire (philosophy)|desires]] or [[well-being]]) are substantially-equivalent to the others' interests and well-being. Egoism, utilitarianism, and altruism are all forms of [[consequentialism]], but egoism and altruism contrast with utilitarianism, in that egoism and altruism are both [[Consequentialism#Agent-focused or agent-neutral|agent-focused]] forms of consequentialism (i.e. subject-focused or [[subjectivity|subjective]]), but utilitarianism is called [[Consequentialism#Agent-focused or agent-neutral|agent-neutral]] (i.e. [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and [[impartial]]) as it does not treat the subject's (i.e. the self's, i.e. the moral "agent's") own interests as being more or less important than if the same interests, desires, or well-being were anyone else's.  . 

Ethical egoism does not, however, require moral agents to harm the interests and well-being of others when making moral deliberation; e.g. what is in an agent's self-interest may be incidentally detrimental, beneficial, or neutral in its effect on others. Individualism allows for others' interest and well-being to be disregarded or not, as long as what is chosen is efficacious in satisfying the self-interest of the agent. Nor does ethical egoism necessarily entail that, in pursuing self-interest, one ought always to do what one wants to do; e.g. in the long term, the fulfilment of short-term desires may prove detrimental to [[self (philosophy)|the self]].  Fleeting pleasance, then, takes a back seat to protracted eudaemonia.  In the words of [[James Rachels]], "Ethical egoism [...] endorses selfishness, but it doesn't endorse foolishness."<ref name="Rachels 2008, p. 534">Rachels 2008, p. 534. </ref> . 

Ethical egoism is sometimes the philosophical basis for support of [[libertarianism]] or [[individualist anarchism]] as in [[Max Stirner]], although these can also be based on altruistic motivations. <ref name=ridgely>{{cite web

=== Existentialism ===. 
{{Main|Existentialism}}
Existentialism is a term applied to the work of a number of [[19th century philosophy|19th-]] and [[20th century philosophy|20th-century philosophers]] who, despite profound doctrinal differences,<ref>Macquarrie, John. ''Existentialism'', New York (1972), pp. 18–21. </ref><ref>''Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', ed. Ted Honderich, New York (1995), p. 259. </ref> generally held that the focus of philosophical thought should be to deal with the conditions of existence of the individual person and his or her emotions, actions, responsibilities, and thoughts. <ref>Macquarrie.

''The Oxford handbook of religion and emotion'' (Oxford, 2008, pp. 387-388)</ref> . 

Subsequent existential philosophers retain the emphasis on the individual, but differ, in varying degrees, on how one achieves and what constitutes a fulfilling life, what obstacles must be overcome, and what external and internal factors are involved, including the potential consequences of the [[Christian existentialism|existence]]<ref>Livingston, James et al.

=== Freethought ===. 
{{Main|Freethought}}
Freethought holds that individuals should not accept ideas proposed as [[truth]] without recourse to [[knowledge]] and [[reason]]. Thus, freethinkers strive to build their opinions on the basis of [[fact]]s, [[scientific method|scientific inquiry]], and [[logic]]al principles, independent of any logical [[fallacy|fallacies]] or intellectually limiting effects of [[authority]], [[confirmation bias]], [[cognitive bias]], [[conventional wisdom]], [[popular culture]], [[prejudice]], [[sectarianism]], [[tradition]], [[urban legend]], and all other [[dogma]]s.  Regarding [[religion]], freethinkers hold that there is insufficient evidence to scientifically validate the existence of [[supernatural]] phenomena. <ref>Hastings, James. [http://books.google.com/books?id=ZAwwaxdKMNAC Encyclopedia of Religion]</ref> . 

=== Humanism ===. 
{{Main|Humanism}}
Humanism is a perspective common to a wide range of [[ethics|ethical stances]] that attaches importance to human dignity, concerns, and capabilities, particularly [[rationalism|rationality]]. Although the word has many senses, its meaning comes into focus when contrasted to the [[supernatural]] or to appeals to [[authority]]. <ref>{{cite book|title=Compact Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|quote=humanism ''n.'' 1 a rationalistic system of thought attaching prime importance to human rather than divine or supernatural matters. 2 a Renaissance cultural movement that turned away from medieval scholasticism and revived interest in ancient Greek and Roman thought.|publication-date = 2007}} Typically, abridgments of this definition omit all senses except #1, such as in the [http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=38402&dict=CALD Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary], [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/humanism Collins Essential English Dictionary], and {{cite book|title=Webster's Concise Dictionary|publisher=RHR Press|year = 2001|location=New York|page=177}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Definitions of humanism (subsection)|publisher=Institute for Humanist Studies|url=http://humaniststudies.org/humphil.html|accessdate=[[16 Jan]] 2007}}</ref> Since the 19th century, humanism has been associated with an [[anti-clericalism]] inherited from the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ''[[philosophes]]''. 21st century Humanism tends to strongly endorse [[human rights]], including [[reproductive rights]], [[gender equality]], [[social justice]], and the [[separation of church and state]].

=== Hedonism ===. 
{{Main|Hedonism}}
Hedonism is a school of [[ethics]] which argues that [[pleasure]] is the only  [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic good]]. <ref name="stanford">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hedonism/ Hedonism], 2004-04-20 [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]</ref> The basic idea behind hedonistic thought is that pleasure is the only thing that is good for a person. This is often used as a justification for evaluating actions in terms of how much ''pleasure'' and how little ''pain'' (i.e. [[suffering]]) they produce. In very simple terms, a hedonist strives to maximize this net pleasure (pleasure minus pain).  . 

=== Libertinism ===. 
{{Main|Libertine}}
A libertine is one devoid of most moral restraints, which are seen as unnecessary or undesirable, especially one who ignores or even spurns accepted morals and forms of behavior sanctioned by the larger society. Libertines, also known as [[Rake (character)|rakes]], placed value on physical pleasures, meaning those experienced through the five senses. As a philosophy, libertinism gained new-found adherents in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, particularly in [[France]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Notable among these were [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]], and the [[Marquis de Sade]]. "Libertine" is defined today as "a dissolute person; usually a person who is morally unrestrained".  . 

=== Objectivism ===. 
{{Main|Objectivism (Ayn Rand)}}
[[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] is a system of philosophy created by philosopher and novelist [[Ayn Rand]] (1905–1982) that holds: [[reality]] exists independent of consciousness; human beings gain [[knowledge]] rationally from perception through the process of concept formation and inductive and deductive logic; the moral purpose of one's life is the pursuit of one's own happiness or rational [[wikt:self-interest|self-interest]]. Rand thinks the only social system consistent with this morality is full respect for [[individual rights]], embodied in pure ''[[laissez faire]]'' [[capitalism]]; and the role of [[art]] in human life is to transform man's widest metaphysical ideas, by selective reproduction of reality, into a physical form—a work of art—that he can comprehend and to which he can respond emotionally. Objectivism celebrates man as his own hero, "with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute."<ref>"About the Author" in {{harvnb|Rand|1992|pp=1170–1171}}</ref> . 

=== Philosophical anarchism ===. 
{{Main|Philosophical anarchism}}
Philosophical anarchism is an [[anarchist school of thought]]<ref>Wayne Gabardi, [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-0554%28198603%2980%3A1%3C300%3AA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-6 review] of ''Anarchism'' by David Miller, published in ''American Political Science Review'' Vol. 80, No. 1. (Mar., 1986), pp. 300-302. </ref> which contends that the [[Sovereign state|State]] lacks [[legitimacy (political)|moral legitimacy]] and -in contrast to revolutionary anarchism- does not advocate violent revolution to eliminate it but advocate peaceful evolution to superate it. <ref>According to scholar [[Allan Antliff]], [[Benjamin Tucker]] coined the term "philosophical anarchism," to distinguish peaceful evolutionary anarchism from revolutionary variants. ''Antliff, Allan. 2001. [http://books.google.com.ec/books?id=dQTk-N4JWbYC&dq= Anarchist Modernism: Art, Politics, and the First American Avant-Garde]. University of Chicago Press. p.4''</ref> Though philosophical anarchism does not necessarily imply any action or desire for the elimination of the State, philosophical anarchists do not believe that they have an obligation or duty to obey the State, or conversely, that the State has a right to command.  . 

Philosophical anarchism is a component especially of [[individualist anarchism]]. <ref>Outhwaite, William & Tourain, Alain (Eds.). (2003). Anarchism. The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought (2nd Edition, p. 12). Blackwell Publishing</ref> Philosophical anarchists of historical note include [[Mohandas Gandhi]], [[William Godwin]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Max Stirner]],<ref>Michael Freeden identifies four broad types of individualist anarchism. He says the first is the type associated with [[William Godwin]] that advocates [[self-government]] with a "progressive [[rationalism]] that included benevolence to others." The second type is the amoral self-serving rationality of [[Egotism|Egoism]], as most associated with [[Max Stirner]]. The third type is "found in [[Herbert Spencer]]'s early predictions, and in that of some of his disciples such as [[Wordsworth Donisthorpe|Donisthorpe]], foreseeing the redundancy of the state in the source of social evolution." The fourth type retains a moderated form of Egoism and accounts for social cooperation through the advocacy of market. ''Freeden, Micheal.

Thoreau's Proposals for Legislation. American Quarterly, Vol. 7, No. 3 (Autumn, 1955). p. 285</ref> Contemporary philosophical anarchists include A. John Simmons and [[Robert Paul Wolff]].  . 

=== Subjectivism ===. 
{{Main|Subjectivism}}
Subjectivism is a philosophical tenet that accords primacy to subjective experience as fundamental of all measure and law. In extreme forms like [[Solipsism]], it may hold that the nature and existence of every object depends solely on someone's subjective awareness of it. For example, [[Wittgenstein]] wrote in [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]: "The subject doesn't belong to the world, but it is a limit of the world" (proposition 5.632). Metaphysical subjectivism is the theory that reality is what we perceive to be real, and that there is no underlying true reality that exists independently of perception. One can also hold that it is [[consciousness]] rather than perception that is reality ([[subjective idealism]]). In [[probability]], a subjectivism stands for the belief that probabilities are simply degrees-of-belief by rational agents in a certain proposition, and which have no objective reality in and of themselves.  . 

[[Ethical subjectivism]] stands in opposition to [[moral realism]], which claims that moral propositions refer to objective facts, independent of human opinion; to [[error theory]], which denies that any moral propositions are true in any sense; and to [[non-cognitivism]], which denies that moral sentences express propositions at all. The most common forms of ethical subjectivism are also forms of [[moral relativism]], with moral standards held to be relative to each culture or society (c.f. [[cultural relativism]]), or even to every individual. The latter view, as put forward by [[Protagoras]], holds that there are as many distinct scales of good and evil as there are subjects in the world. Moral subjectivism is that species of moral relativism that relativizes moral value to the individual subject.  . 

====Solipsism====. 
{{Main|Solipsism}}
Solipsism is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] idea that only one's own [[mind]] is sure to exist. The term comes from [[Latin]] ''solus'' (alone) and ''ipse'' (self). Solipsism as an [[epistemology|epistemological]] position holds that [[knowledge]] of anything outside one's own mind is unsure. [[Philosophical skepticism|The external world]] and [[problem of other minds|other minds]] cannot be known, and might not exist outside the mind. As a [[metaphysical]] position, solipsism goes further to the conclusion that the world and other minds do not exist. As such it is the only epistemological position that, by its own [[Wiktionary:postulate#Pronunciation|postulate]], is both [[Wiktionary:irrefutable#English|irrefutable]] and yet indefensible in the same manner. Although the number of individuals sincerely espousing solipsism has been small, it is not uncommon for one philosopher to accuse another's arguments of entailing solipsism as an unwanted consequence, in a kind of [[reductio ad absurdum]]. In the history of philosophy, solipsism has served as a [[skeptical hypothesis]].  . 

==Economic individualism==. 
The [[doctrine]] of economic individualism holds that each individual should be allowed [[autonomy]] in making his or her own economic decisions as opposed to those decisions being made by the [[Sovereign state|state]], the [[community]], the [[corporation]] etc. for him or her.  . 

=== Classical liberalism ===. 
{{Main|Classical liberalism}}
Classical liberalism is a political ideology that developed in the 19th century in [[England]], [[Western Europe]], and the [[Americas]].  It followed earlier forms of liberalism in its  commitment to personal freedom and popular government, but differed from earlier forms of liberalism in its commitment to [[free markets]] and [[classical economics]]. <ref>[http://www.google.com/books?id=sq-1z8VMhDEC&lpg=PP1&dq=Modern%20Political%20Philosophy&pg=PA37#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''Modern political philosophy'' (1999), Richard Hudelson, p, 37]</ref>  Notable classical liberals in the 19th century include [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], [[Thomas Malthus]], and [[David Ricardo]].  Classical liberalism was revived in the 20th century by [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]], and further developed by [[Milton Friedman]], [[Robert Nozick]], [[Loren Lomasky]], and [[Jan Narveson]]. <ref>[[David Conway]]. ''Classical Liberalism: The Unvanquished Ideal.'' Palgrave Macmillan. 1998. ISBN 978-0-312-21932-1 p. 8</ref> . 

The phrase ''classical liberalism'' is also sometimes used to refer to all forms of liberalism before the 20th century.  And, after 1970, the phrase began to be used by [[Libertarians]] to describe their belief in the primacy of economic freedom and minimal government.  It is sometimes difficult to tell which meaning is intended in a given source.  . 

=== Individualist anarchism and economics ===. 
In regards to economic questions within [[individualist anarchism]] there are adherents to [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] ([[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]], [[Emile Armand]]), early [[Benjamin Tucker]]); [[natural rights]] positions (Early Benjamin Tucker, [[Lysander Spooner]], [[Josiah Warren]]); and [[Egoist anarchism|egoist]]ic disrespect for "ghosts" such as private property and markets ([[Max Stirner]], [[John Henry Mackay]], [[Lev Chernyi]], later [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Renzo Novatore]], [[illegalism]]).  . 

==== Mutualism ====. 
{{Main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
Mutualism is an [[anarchist school of thought]] which can be traced to the writings of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], who envisioned a society where each person might possess a [[means of production]], either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the [[free market]]. <ref>[http://www.mutualist.org/ Mutualist.org Introduction]</ref> Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank which would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate only high enough to cover the costs of administration. <ref>Miller, David. 1987. "Mutualism." The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought. Blackwell Publishing. p. 11</ref> Mutualism is based on a [[labor theory of value]] which holds that when labor or its product is sold, in exchange, it ought to receive goods or services embodying "the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility". <ref>Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''[[Voluntary Socialism]]'', chapter 6, paragraph 15. </ref> Receiving anything less would be considered exploitation, theft of labor, or [[usury]]. 
[[File:BenjaminTucker.jpg|180px|left|thumb|[[Benjamin Tucker]], [[american individualist anarchist]] who focused on economics calling them "Anarchistic-Socialism"<ref>Tucker said, ''"the fact that one class of men are dependent for their living upon the sale of their labour, while another class of men are relieved of the necessity of labour by being legally privileged to sell something that is not labour. . . . And to such a state of things I am as much opposed as any one. But the minute you remove privilege. . . every man will be a labourer exchanging with fellow-labourers . . . What Anarchistic-Socialism aims to abolish is usury . . . it wants to deprive capital of its reward."''[[Benjamin Tucker]].

''Socialismo Libertário ou Anarchismo'' Vol. 1 (1896): "Society should be free through mankind's spontaneous federative affiliation to life, based on the community of land and tools of the trade; meaning: Anarchy will be equality by abolition of private property and liberty by abolition of authority". </ref> Libertarian socialism also constitutes a tendency of thought that promotes the identification, criticism and practical dismantling of illegitimate authority in all aspects of life.  . 

Accordingly, libertarian socialists believe that "the exercise of power in any institutionalized form—whether economic, political, religious, or sexual—brutalizes both the wielder of power and the one over whom it is exercised". <ref>{{cite book | last=Ackelsberg | first=Martha A. | title=Free Women of Spain: Anarchism and the Struggle for the Emancipation of Women | page=41 | year=2005 | publisher=[[AK Press]] | isbn=978-1-902593-96-8}}</ref> Libertarian socialists generally place their hopes in decentralized means of [[direct democracy]] such as [[libertarian municipalism]], citizens' assemblies, [[trade union]]s and [[workers' council]]s. <ref>{{cite book | last=Rocker | first=Rudolf | title=Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice | page=65 | year=2004 | publisher=[[AK Press]] | isbn=978-1-902593-92-0 }}</ref> .

Cassell, 1997. p. 170</ref><ref>Steven V Hicks, Daniel E Shannon. The American journal of economics and sociolology. Blackwell Pub, 2003. p. 612</ref> is a term that has been used to describe several different [[libertarianism|libertarian]] political movements and theorists.  . 

Left-libertarianism, as defended by contemporary theorists such as [[Peter Vallentyne]], [[Hillel Steiner]], and [[Michael Otsuka]], is a doctrine that has a strong commitment to personal liberty ''and'' has an [[egalitarian]] view concerning [[natural resources]], believing that it is illegitimate for anyone to claim [[property|private ownership]] of resources to the detriment of others. <ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/ "Libertarianism" entry] at the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''<br />Prof. Will Kymlicka "libertarianism, left-" in {{cite book |last=Honderich |first=Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford UP|location=New York |year=2005 |isbn=9780199264797 |quote=It combines the libertarian assumption that each person possesses a natural right of self-ownership over his person with the egalitarian premise that natural resources should be shared equally. Right-wing libertarians argue that the right of self-ownership entails the right to appropriate unequal parts of the external world, such as unequal amounts of land. According to left-libertarians, however, the world's natural resources were initially unowned, or belonged equally to all, and it is illegitimate for anyone to claim exclusive private ownership of these resources to the detriment of others. Such private appropriation is legitimate only if everyone can appropriate an equal amount, or if those who appropriate more are taxed to compensate those who are thereby excluded from what was once common property.}} See also Steiner, Hillel & Vallentyne. 2000.

=== Right-libertarianism ===. 
{{Main|Right-libertarianism}}
Right-libertarianism or right libertarianism is a phrase used by some to describe either non-[[collectivist]] forms of [[libertarianism]]<ref>Serena Olsaretti, [http://books.google.com/books?id=NZmGrPKu8BMC Liberty, Desert and the Market: A Philosophical Study], Cambridge University Press, 2004, 14, 88, 100. </ref> or a variety of different libertarian views some label "right" of mainstream libertarianism including "[[libertarian conservatism]]".  . 

[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] calls it "right libertarianism" but states: "Libertarianism is often thought of as 'right-wing' doctrine. This, however, is mistaken for at least two reasons. First, on social—rather than economic—issues, libertarianism tends to be 'left-wing'. It opposes laws that restrict consensual and private sexual relationships between adults (e.g., gay sex, non-marital sex, and deviant sex), laws that restrict drug use, laws that impose religious views or practices on individuals, and compulsory military service. Second, in addition to the better-known version of libertarianism—right-libertarianism—there is also a version known as '[[left-libertarianism]]'. Both endorse full self-ownership, but they differ with respect to the powers agents have to appropriate unappropriated natural resources (land, air, water, etc.)."<ref>[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] entry on [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism Libertarianism], [[Stanford University]], July 24, 2006 version. </ref> . 

==Methodological individualism==. 
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}
For some individualists, who hold a view known as [[methodological individualism]], the word "society" cannot refer to anything more than a very large collection of individuals. Society does not have an existence above or beyond these individuals, and thus cannot be properly said to carry out actions, since actions require intentionality, intentionality requires an agent, and society as a whole cannot be properly said to possess agency; only individuals can be agents. The same holds for the government. Under this view, a government is composed of individuals; despite that democratic governments are elected by popular vote, the fact remains that all of the activities of government are carried out by means of the intentions and actions of individuals. Strictly speaking, the government itself does not act. For example, the point is sometimes made that "we" have decided to enact a certain policy, and sometimes this usage is used to imply that the entity known as "society" supports the policy and thus it is justified. The methodological individualist points out that "we" in fact did not enact or carry out this policy; among those who voted, a certain group of people voted for the policy, individuals all, and another group voted against it. The decision that emerged was not made by the "people", or by the "government"; it was made by those on the winning side of the vote. This is significant because in any collective there exists individuals who oppose the policy whose wills are being overridden, and the use of "we" tends to obscure that fact. The individualist wishes to highlight the importance of the individual and prevent subsumption into a collective. For these reasons, methodological individualists tend to disagree with claims such as "we deserve the government we have, because we are doing it to ourselves," since perhaps that individual and very possibly many others disagree with the actions of the individuals who hold government power. That said, many individualists are willing to use "we" in reference to government or society as a convenient shorthand as long as the fact that these entities are composed of individuals is kept in mind.  . 

== Individualism as creative independent lifestyle ==. 
[[File:Oscar Wilde portrait.jpg|150px|left|thumb|[[Oscar Wilde]], famous [[anarchist]] [[Irish people|Irish]] writer of the [[decadent movement]] and famous [[dandy]]]]The [[anarchist]]<ref>"The most ambitious contribution to literary anarchism during the 1890's was undoubtedly Oscar Wilde ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]''. Wilde, as we have seen, declared himself an anarchist on at least one occasion during the 1890's, and he greatly admired [[Kropotkin]], whom he had met. Later, in De Profundis, he described Kropotkin's life as one "of the most perfect lives I have come across in my own experience" and talked of him as "a man with a soul of that beautiful white Christ that seems coming out of Russia." But in The Soul of Man Under Socialism, which appeared in 1890, it is [[William Godwin|Godwin]] rather than Kropotkin whose influence seems dominant." [[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements.'' 1962. (pg. 447)</ref> writer and [[bohemianism|bohemian]] [[Oscar Wilde]] wrote in his famous essay ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]'' that "[[Art]] is individualism, and individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force. There lies its immense value. For what it seeks is to disturb monotony of type, slavery of custom, tyranny of habit, and the reduction of man to the level of a machine."<ref>[http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/hist_texts/wilde_soul.html The soul of man under Socialism by [[Oscar Wilde]]]</ref> For anarchist historian [[George Woodcock]] "Wilde's aim in ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]'' is to seek the society most favorable to the artist...for Wilde art is the supreme end, containing within itself enlightenment and regeneration, to which all else in society must be subordinated...Wilde represents the anarchist as [[aesthete]]."<ref>[[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements.'' 1962. (pg. 447)</ref> The word individualism in this way has been used to denote a personality with a strong tendency towards self creation and experimentation as opposed to tradition or popular mass opinions and behaviors<ref name="thefreedictionary.com"/><ref name="jstor.org"/> . 

Anarchist writer [[Murray Bookchin]] describes a lot of [[individualist anarchism]] as people who "expressed their opposition in uniquely personal forms, especially in fiery tracts, outrageous behavior, and aberrant lifestyles in the cultural ghettos of fin de sicle New York, Paris, and London. As a credo, individualist anarchism remained largely a [[bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle, most conspicuous in its demands for sexual freedom ('[[free love]]') and enamored of innovations in art, behavior, and clothing."<ref name="bohemian individualism"/> . 

In relation to this view of individuality, French [[Individualist anarchist]] [[Emile Armand]] advocates [[ethical egoism|egoist]]ical denial of social conventions and dogmas to live in accord to one's own ways and desires in daily life since he emphasized anarchism as a way of life and practice. In this way he manifests "So the anarchist individualist tends to reproduce himself, to perpetuate his spirit in other individuals who will share his views and who will make it possible for a state of affairs to be established from which authoritarianism has been banished. It is this desire, this will, not only to live, but also to reproduce oneself, which we shall call "activity". <ref name="lifeactivity">[http://www.spaz.org/~dan/individualist-anarchist/library/emile-armand/life-activity.html "Anarchist Individualism as a Life and Activity" by Emile Armand]</ref> . 

In the book ''Imperfect garden : the legacy of humanism'', humanist philosopher [[Tzvetan Todorov]] identifies individualism as an important current of socio-political thought within modernity and as examples of it he mentions [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[François de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|François de La Rochefoucauld]], [[Marquis de Sade]], and [[Charles Baudelaire]]<ref name="Princeton University Press 2002">''Imperfect garden : the legacy of humanism''. Princeton University Press. 2002. </ref> In La Rochefoucauld, he identifies a tendency similar to [[stoicism]] in which "the honest person works his being in the manner of an [[sculptor]] who searches the liberation of the forms which are inside a block of [[marble]], to extract the truth of that matter."<ref name="Princeton University Press 2002"/> In Baudelaire he finds the [[dandy]] trait in which one searches to cultivate "the idea of beauty within oneself, of satisfying one´s passions of feeling and thinking."<ref name="Princeton University Press 2002"/> . 

The [[Russian American|Russian-American]] poet [[Joseph Brodsky]] one manifested that "The surest defense against Evil is extreme individualism, originality of thinking, whimsicality, even—if you will—eccentricity. That is, something that can't be feigned, faked, imitated; something even a seasoned imposter couldn't be happy with."<ref>http://quotes.dictionary.com/The_surest_defense_against_Evil_is_extreme_individualism Share Joseph Brodsky Joseph Brodsky (b. 1940) Address, 1984, delivered at Williams College.

Equally memorable and influential on [[Walt Whitman]] is Emerson’s idea that “a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines.”...Emerson opposes on principle the reliance on social structures (civil, religious) precisely because through them the individual approaches the divine second hand, mediated by the once original experience of a genius from another age: “An institution,” as he explains, “is the lengthened shadow of one man.” To achieve this original relation one must “Insist on one’s self; never imitate” for if the relationship is secondary the connection is lost."<ref>[http://www.iep.utm.edu/emerson/#H2 "Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803—1882)" on [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]]</ref> .
