In [[crime]] and [[law]], '''hate crimes''' (also known as '''bias-motivated crimes''') occur when a perpetrator targets a victim because of his or her perceived membership in a certain [[social group]], usually defined by [[race (classification of humans)|racial group]], [[religion]], [[sexual orientation]], [[disability]], [[Social class|class]], [[ethnicity]], [[nationality]], [[Ageing|age]], [[sex]], [[gender identity]], [[social status]] or [[political affiliation]]. <ref name="williams">Stotzer, R.:  "[http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Stotzer-Comparison-Hate-Crime-June-2007.pdf Comparison of Hate Crime Rates Across Protected and Unprotected Groups]", [[Williams Institute]], 2007–06. Retrieved on 2012-03-17. "A hate crime or bias motivated crime occurs when the perpetrator of the crime intentionally selects the victim because of his or her membership in a certain group."</ref> . 

A hate crime is a category used to described '''bias-motivated violence''': "[[assault]], [[injury]], and [[murder]] on the basis of certain personal characteristics: different appearance, different color, different nationality, different language, different religion."<ref name="Streis">Streissguth, Tom (2003). ''Hate Crimes'' (Library in a Book), p.3. ISBN 0-8160-4879-7. </ref> . 

"Hate crime" generally refers to [[crime|criminal acts]] that are seen to have been motivated by bias against one or more of the types above, or of their derivatives. Incidents may involve physical assault, damage to property, [[bullying]], [[harassment]], [[verbal abuse]] or [[insults]], or offensive [[graffiti]] or letters ([[hate mail]]). <ref name = "ovrbwx">[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-victims/reducing-crime/hate-crime/ Hate crime], [[Home Office]]</ref> . 

A '''hate crime law''' is a law intended to prevent bias-motivated violence. Hate crime laws are distinct from laws against [[hate speech]] in that hate crime laws enhance the penalties associated with conduct that is already criminal under other laws, while [[hate speech]] laws criminalize speech.  . 

==History==. 
[[Nazi]] [[pogroms]] started out as locally-sanctioned anti-Jewish activity in the early years of Nazi occupations and eventually reaching its apex in the [[Final Solution]] for the [[Jew]]s.  . 

More recently, ethnic conflicts in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[genocide]] in [[Rwanda]] have been described as mass-based hate crimes, but the term "hate crime" did not really begin to be used until after [[World War II]] and the end of most major government-sanctioned [[Ethnic cleansing|racial cleansing]] projects that had been linked with official [[fascism]]. The term "hate crime" is now used more often than in the past mainly because the groups that used to have official endorsement under with intergovernmental and/or [[armed forces]] involvement.  . 

Concern about hate crimes has become increasingly prominent among policymakers in many nations and at all levels of [[government]] in recent years. There have been many examples throughout modern-day [[Europe]] by  groups who harass and threaten many different racial groups.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} <!-- Many specific examples of European hate crimes and in other world locations could and should go here; there is no reason to have this article be U.S.-centric. Please add examples and include citations --> In the [[United States]], racial and religious biases have inspired most hate crimes.  . 

[[File:Duluth-lynching-postcard.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Postcard of the [[1920 Duluth lynchings|Duluth lynchings]] of black men on June 15, 1920]] . 

Hate crimes have a history longer than the US itself. The verb ''[[lynching]]'' is derived from [[Charles Lynch (jurist)|Charles Lynch]], an 18th-century Virginia planter known for leading [[vigilante]] actions against [[Tories]] including [[tarring and feathering]] and [[hanging]]. ''Lynching'' now thus means execution outside of "ordinary justice" and is associated with weak or nonexistent [[police authority]], like in the [[Old West]], and [[racism]]. <ref name="Streis"/> . 

As [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] began to [[colonialism|colonize]] the New World in the 16th and 17th centuries, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] increasingly became the targets of bias-motivated [[intimidation]] and [[violence]]. During the past two centuries, some of the more typical examples of hate crimes in the U.S. include [[lynchings]] of [[African Americans]], [[cross burnings]] to drive black families from predominantly white neighborhoods, [[assault]]s on white people traveling in predominantly black neighborhoods, assaults on [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] people, the painting of [[swastika]]s on Jewish [[synagogues]] and xenophobic responses to a variety of [[minorities|minority]] [[ethnic group]]s. <ref name = "tvccce">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/bja/162304.pdf |title=A Policymaker's Guide to Hate Crimes |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-11-14}}</ref> . 

Examples like the [[murder of Channon Christian and Christopher Newsom]] and the [[Wichita Massacre]] tend not to be classified as "hate crimes" by U.S. investigative officials, but they have meanwhile been described as "hate crimes against whites by blacks" by right-wing commentators such as [[David Horowitz]] (a right-wing author and academic) and [[Michelle Malkin]] (a commentator for the [[Fox News]] channel and a prolific [[conservative (politics)|conservative]] author). The [[district attorney]]s in both these cases have specifically stated that while these incidents were indeed horrible, and had tremendous impacts on the communities affected by them, neither displayed evidence of being black-on-white [[racism]], either upon initial or more in-depth review.  . 

==Hate crime victims==. 
[[File:АнтисемитизмКрещатик.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Anti-Semitic]] [[graffiti]] in [[Kiev]].]]
In the United States, racist anti-[[black people|black]] bias is the most frequently reported hate crime motivation. Of the 8,208 hate crimes reported to the FBI in 2010, 48.2% were race related - with 70.0% of those having an anti-black bias. <ref name="fbi 2010">{{cite web|url=http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2010/narratives/hate-crime-2010-victims |publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]|title=Hate Crime Statistics, 2010|accessdate=March 16, 2012}}</ref> Other frequently reported bias motivations were anti-white, anti-Jewish, anti-Islamic, anti-homosexual, and anti-Hispanic. <ref name="fbi 2010" /> . 

==Psychological effects==. 
From a [[Psychology|psychological]] standpoint, hate crimes may have extreme consequences. A manual issued by the Attorney-General of the Province of [[Ontario]] in Canada lists the following consequences:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/french/crim/cpm/2005/HateCrimeDiscrimination.pdf |title=MANUEL DES POLITIQUES DE LA COURONNE  |date=21 mars 2005  |format=PDF |language=French |accessdate=2009-06-21}}</ref> . 

* ''effects on people'' – psychological and [[affection|affective]] disturbances; repercussion on the victim's identity and [[self-esteem]]; both reinforced by the degree of violence of a hate crime, usually stronger than that of a common one.  . 

* ''effect on the targeted group'' – generalized [[fear|terror]] in the group to which the victim belongs, inspiring feelings of vulnerability over the other members, who could be the next victims.  . 

* ''effect on other vulnerable groups'' – ominous effects over [[minority groups]] or over groups that identify themselves with the targeted one, especially when the referred hate is based on an [[ideology]] or [[doctrine]] that preaches simultaneously against several groups.  . 

==Hate crime laws==. 
Hate crime laws generally fall into one of several categories:
#laws defining specific bias-motivated acts as distinct crimes;
#criminal penalty-enhancement laws;
#laws creating a distinct civil cause of action for hate crimes; and
#laws requiring administrative agencies to collect hate crime statistics. <ref name="human">[http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/2005/04/23/everyday-fears-a-survey-of-violent-hate-crimes-in-europe-and-north-america/ Michael McClintock: ''Everyday Fears: A Survey of Violent Hate Crimes in Europe and North America'']</ref>  Sometimes (as in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]), the laws focus on [[war crimes]], [[genocide]], and [[crimes against humanity]] with the prohibition against discriminatory action limited to public officials.  . 

===Eurasia===. 
==== European Union ====. 
Since 2002, with an amendment to the [[Convention on Cybercrime]], the European Union mandates individual states to punish as a crime [[hate speech]] done through the internet. <ref>Arias, Martha L. [https://www.ibls.com/internet_law_news_portal_view.aspx?s=latestnews&id=2422 ''INTERNET LAW - The European Union Criminalizes Acts of Racism and Xenophobia Committed through Computer Systems''],  April 20, 2011</ref> . 

==== Andorra ====. 
Discriminatory acts constituting harassment or infringement of a person's dignity on the basis of origin, citizenship, race, religion, or sex (Penal Code Article 313). Courts have cited bias-based motivation in delivering sentences, but there is no explicit penalty enhancement provision in the Criminal Code. The government does not track hate crime statistics, although they are relatively rare. <ref name="human" /> . 

====Armenia====. 
[[Armenia]] has a penalty-enhancement statute for crimes with ethnic, racial, or religious motives (Criminal Code Article 63). <ref name="human" /> .

[[Austria]] has a penalty-enhancement statute for crimes with racist or xenophobic motivation (Penal Code section 33(5)). <ref name="human" /> . 

====Azerbaijan====. 
[[Azerbaijan]] has a penalty-enhancement statute for crimes motivated by racial, national, or religious hatred (Criminal Code Article 61).

====Belarus====. 
[[Belarus]] has a penalty-enhancement statute for crimes motivated by racial, national, and religious hatred and discord. <ref name="human" /><ref>[http://www.pravo.by/webnpa/text.asp?RN=HK9900275 Criminal Code of the Republic of Belarus, § 64 (1), para. 9 (translated from the Russian)], June 9, 1999. </ref> . 

====Belgium====. 
[[Belgium]]'s Act of 25 February 2003 ("aimed at combating discrimination and modifying the Act of 15 February 1993 which establishes the Centre for Equal Opportunities and the Fight against Racism") establishes a penalty-enhancement for crimes involving discrimination on the basis of sex, supposed race, color, descent, national or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, civil status, birth, fortune, age, religious or philosophical beliefs, current or future state of health and handicap or physical features. The Act also "provides for a civil remedy to address discrimination."<ref name="human" />  The Act, along with the Act of 20 January 2003 ("on strengthening legislation against racism"), requires the Centre to collect and publish statistical data on racism and discriminatory crimes. <ref name="human" /> . 

====Bosnia and Herzegovina====. 
The Criminal Code of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (enacted 2003) "contains provisions prohibiting discrimination by public officials on grounds, inter alia, of race, skin colour, national or ethnic background, religion and language and prohibiting the restriction by public officials of the language rights of the citizens in their relations with the authorities (Article 145/1 and 145/2)."<ref>Office of the High Representative, [http://www.ohr.int/decisions/judicialrdec/doc/HiRep-dec-101-law-crim-code-bih.doc Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina], January 2003. </ref> . 

====Bulgaria====. 
[[Bulgaria]]n criminal law prohibits certain crimes motivated by racism and xenophobia, but a 1999 report by the [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]] found that it does not appear that those provisions "have ever resulted in convictions before the courts in Bulgaria."<ref>ECRI, Second Report on Bulgaria, adopted on June 18, 1999, and made public on March 21, 2000. </ref> . 

====Croatia====. 
[[Croatia]]n Penal code explicitly defines hate crime in article 89 as "any crime committed out of hatred for someones race, skin color, sex, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other belief, national or social background, asset, birth, education, social condition, age, health condition or other attribute". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2006_06_71_1706.html |title=71 28.6.2006 Zakon o izmjenama i dopunama Kaznenog zakona |publisher=Narodne-novine.nn.hr |date=2006-06-28 |accessdate=2011-11-14}}</ref> On 1 January 2013 new Penal code will be introduced with the recognition of a hate crime based on a "race, skin color, religion, national or ethnic background, sexual orientation or gender identity". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ravnopravnost.hr/web/184/ |title=Centar za LGBT ravnopravnost » Vlada prihvatila prijedloge Centra za LGBT ravnopravnost |publisher=Ravnopravnost.hr |date= |accessdate=2011-11-14}}</ref> . 

====Czech Republic====. 
"The [[Czech Republic|Czech]] Criminal Code defines racist motivation as a specific aggravating circumstance that judges are required to take into account in sentencing, as well as defining specific racist acts as crimes. Section 196 punishes 'violence against a group of inhabitants and against individuals on the basis of race, nationality, political conviction or religion.'"<ref name="human" /> . 

====Denmark====. 
Although [[Denmark|Danish]] law does not include explicit hate crime provisions, "section 80(1) of the Criminal Code instructs courts to take into account the gravity of the offence and the offender's motive when meting out penalty, and therefore to attach importance to the racist motive of crimes in determining sentence."<ref>ECRI, Second Report on Denmark, adopted on June 16, 2000, and made public on April 3, 2001, para. 9. </ref>  In recent years judges have used this provision to increase sentences on the basis of racist motives. <ref name="human" /><ref>Chahrokh, Klug, and Bilger, Migrants, Minorities, and Legislation. </ref> . 

Since 1992, the Danish Civil Security Service (PET) has released statistics on crimes with apparent racist motivation. <ref name="human" /> . 

====Finland====. 
[[Finland|Finnish]] [[Criminal Code of Finland|Criminal Code]] 515/2003 (enacted January 31, 2003) makes "committing a crime against a person, because of his national, racial, ethnical or equivalent group" an aggravating circumstance in sentencing. <ref name="human" /><ref>EUMC, Racism and xenophobia in the E.U., p. 51. </ref> In addition, ethnic agitation ({{lang-fi|kiihotus kansanryhmää vastaan}}) is criminalized and carries a fine or a prison sentence of not more than two years. The prosecution need not prove that an actual danger to an ethnic group is caused but only that malicious message is conveyed. A more aggravated hate crime, warmongering ({{lang-fi|sotaan yllyttäminen}}), carries a prison sentence of one to ten years. However, in case of warmongering, the prosecution must prove an [[overt act]] that evidently increases the risk that Finland is involved in a war or becomes a target for a military operation. The act in question may consist of
#illegal violence directed against foreign country or her citizens,
#systematic dissemination of false information on Finnish foreign policy or defence
#public influence on the public opinion towards a pro-war viewpoint or
#public suggestion that a foreign country or Finland should engage in an aggressive act. <ref>[http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1889/en18890039.pdf Penal Code (39/1889)] as of 1006/2004. §§ 6:5.1.4 (ethnic hatred as an aggravating factor), 11:8 (ethnic agitation) and 12:2 (warmongering).

====France====. 
In 2003, France enacted penalty-enhancement hate crime laws for crimes motivated by bias against the victim's actual or perceived ethnicity, nation, race, religion, or sexual orientation. The penalties for murder were raised from 30 years (for non-hate crimes) to life imprisonment (for hate crimes), and the penalties for violent attacks leading to permanent disability were raised from 10 years (for non-hate crimes) to 15 years (for hate crimes). <ref name="human" /><ref>''[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000781920 Loi n° 2003–88 du 3 février 2003 visant à aggraver les peines punissant les infractions à caractère raciste, antisémite ou xénophobe]''</ref> . 

====Georgia====. 
"There is no general provision in Georgian law for racist motivation to be considered an aggravating circumstance in prosecutions of ordinary offenses. Certain crimes involving racist motivation are, however, defined as specific offenses in the Georgian Criminal Code of 1999, including murder motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 109); infliction of serious
injuries motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 117); and torture motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 126). ECRI reported no knowledge of cases in which this law has been enforced. There is no systematic monitoring or data collection on discrimination in Georgia."<ref name="human" /> . 

====Germany====. 
The [[German Criminal Code]] does not have hate crime legislation, but instead criminalizes [[hate speech]] under a number of different laws, including [[Volksverhetzung]]. In the German legal framework [[motivation]] is not taken into account while identifying the element of the offence. However, within the sentencing procedure the judge can define certain principles for determining punishment. In section 46 of the German Criminal Code it is stated that "the motives and aims of the perpetrator; the state of mind reflected in the act and the wilfulness involved in its commission."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/StGB.htm#46 |title=Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch, StGB) |publisher=Iuscomp.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-14}}</ref> can be taken into consideration when determining the [[punishment]]; under this statute, hate and bias have been taken into consideration in sentencing in past cases. <ref name="Marc Coester 2008">Marc Coester (2008): Das Konzept der Hate Crimes aus den USA unter besonderer Berücksichtigung des Rechtsextremismus in Deutschland.

Hate crimes are not specifically tracked by German police, but have been studied separately: a recently published EU "Report on Racism" finds that racially motivated attacks are frequent in Germany, identifying 18142 incidences for 2006, of which 17597 were motivated by right wing ideologies, both about a 14% year-by-year increase. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,502471,00.html |title=EU Xenophobia Report: Racism On the Rise in Germany - SPIEGEL ONLINE - News - International |publisher=Spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2011-11-14}}</ref>  Relative to the size of the population, this represents an eightfold higher rate of hate crimes than reported in the US during the same period. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2007/november/hatecrime_111907 |title=FBI — 2006 Hate Crime in the U.S |publisher=Fbi.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-11-14}}</ref>  Awareness of hate crimes and right-wing extremism in Germany remains low. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,502694,00.html |title=SPIEGEL ONLINE Interview with Racism Expert: 'Awareness of Ethnic Discrimination Is Low in Germany' - SPIEGEL ONLINE - News - International |publisher=Spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2011-11-14}}</ref> .

establishment of, and membership in, organisations which organise propaganda and activities aimed at racial
discrimination; Section 2 punishes public expression of offensive ideas; Section 3 penalises the act of refusing,

A “religious group” is a group of persons defined by reference to religious belief or lack of religious belief. The specified crimes are assault, criminal damage, offences under the [[Public Order Act 1986]], and offences under the [[Protection from Harassment Act 1997]].  . 

The [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]] requires a court to consider whether a crime which is not specified by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 is racially or religiously aggravated. The Act requires a court also to consider whether the following circumstances were pertinent to the crime:
:(a) that, at the time of committing the offence, or immediately before or after doing so, the offender demonstrated towards the victim of the offence hostility based on—
::(i) the sexual orientation (or presumed sexual orientation) of the victim, or
::(ii) a disability (or presumed disability) of the victim, or
:(b) that the offence is motivated (wholly or partly)—
::(i) by hostility towards persons who are of a particular sexual orientation, or
::(ii) by hostility towards persons who have a disability or a particular disability. <ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030044_en_14#pt12-ch1-pb1-l1g145 Sections 145 and 146 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003]. </ref><ref>"Hate crime" legislation is distinct from "hate speech" legislation.

=====Scotland=====. 
In [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Common law]]{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} the courts can take any aggravating factor into account when sentencing someone found guilty of an offence. There is specific legislation dealing with the offences of incitement of racial hatred, racially-aggravated harassment and offences aggravated by religious prejudice. A [[Scottish Executive]] working group examined the issue of hate crime and ways of combating crime motivated by social prejudice, reporting in 2004. <ref>[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/criminal/17543/8978]{{Dead link|date=June 2009}}</ref> Its main recommendations were not implemented, but in their manifestos for the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007]] several political parties included commitments to legislate in this area, including the [[Scottish National Party]] who now form the Scottish Government.

“In Canada the legal definition of hate crime can be found in sections 318 and 319 of the Criminal Code”. 
<ref name="autogenerated161">{{cite book|last=O'Grady|first=William|title=Crime In Canadian Context: debates and controversies|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-543378-4|page=161}}</ref> . 

In 1996 the federal government amended a section of the Criminal Code that pertains to sentencing. Specifically, section 718.2. The section states (with regard to the hate crime): . 

''A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles: . 

''(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,'' . 

''(i) evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, or any other similar factor, . . . shall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances.''''
<ref name="autogenerated161"/> . 

A vast majority (84 per cent) of Hate crime perpetrators were “male, with an average age of just under 30. Less than 10 of those accused had criminal records, and less than 5 per cent had previous hate crime involvement (ibid O’Grady  2010 page 163.).”
<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Grady|first=William|title=Crime In Canadian Context: debates and controversies|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-543378-4|page=163}}</ref> “Only 4 percent of hate crimes were linked to an organized or extremist group (Silver et al., 2004).”

As of 2004, Jewish people were the largest ethnic group targeted by hate crimes, followed by blacks, Muslims, South Asians, and gays and lesbians (Silver et al., 2004). <ref name="autogenerated162"/> . 

Historically, hate crime has been around for a long time, yet it was most noticed when the lynching of African Americans by white racists took place, an example of what today we call hate crime. Hate related violence also has a historical root in Canada. In the 1920s and 1930s, anti-Semitism was a major deal in Canada, due to the rise of the Nazi government in Germany. For example, on August 16, 1933 there was a baseball game in Toronto and one team was made up of mostly Jewish players. At the end of the game, a group of Nazi sympathizers unfolded a Swastika flag and shouted ‘Heil Hitler’. That event erupted into a brawl that had Jews and Italians against Anglo Canadians and the brawl went on for hours. <ref name="autogenerated161"/> . 

The first time someone was charged with hate crime over the internet occurred on 27 March 1996. “A Winnipeg teenager was arrested by the police for sending an email to a local political activist that contained the message ‘Death to homosexuals’ it’s prescribed in the Bible! Better watch out next Gay Pride Week.’ (Nairne, 1996).” Pg.162<ref name="autogenerated162"/> . 

<!--This sentence would be clearly POV if not added as a quote; it needs either contextualization or removal.-->Robert suggests that “Canada lags behind other nations in collecting comprehensive statistics on hate crime.”

====United States====. 
{{Main|Hate crime laws in the United States}} . 

Hate crime laws have a long history in the United States. The first hate crime laws were passed after the [[American Civil War]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The modern era of hate-crime legislation was begun in 1968 with the passage of federal statute, 18 U.S. 245, part of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968|Civil Rights Act]] which made it illegal to "by force or by threat of force, injure, intimidate, or interfere with anyone who is engaged in six specified protected activities, by reason of their [[race (classification of humans)|race]], [[color]], [[religion]], or [[national origin]]." However, "The prosecution of such crimes must be certified by the U.S. attorney general.". <ref>Streissguth (2003), p.20. </ref> . 

The first state hate-crime statute, California's Section 190.2, was passed in 1978 and provided for [[penalty enhancement]] in cases where murder was motivated by prejudice against four "protected status" categories: race, religion, color, and national origin. Washington included [[ancestry]] in a statute passed in 1981. Alaska included [[religion|creed]] and [[sex]] in 1982 and later [[disability]], [[sexual orientation]], and [[ethnicity]]. In the 1990s some state laws began to include [[ageing|age]], [[marital status]], membership in the [[armed forces]], and membership in [[civil rights]] organizations. <ref>Streissguth (2003), p.20-21. </ref> . 

Criminal acts which could be considered hate crimes in various states included [[aggravated assault]], [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]], [[vandalism]], [[rape]], [[threat]]s and [[intimidation]], [[arson]], [[trespassing]], [[stalking]], and various "lesser" acts until in 1987 California state legislation included all crimes as possible hate crimes. <ref>Streissguth (2003), p.21. </ref> . 

Defined in the 1999 National Crime Victim Survey, "A hate crime is a criminal offense. In the [[United States]], federal prosecution is possible for hate crimes committed on the basis of a person's race, religion, or nation origin when engaging in a federally protected activity." In 2009, the [[Matthew Shepard Act]] added perceived [[gender]], [[gender identity]], [[sexual orientation]], and [[disability]] to the federal definition, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally-protected activity.  . 

Forty-five states and the [[District of Columbia]] have statutes criminalizing various types of hate crimes. Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia have statutes creating a [[Legal liability|civil cause of action]] in addition to the criminal penalty for similar acts. Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have statutes requiring the state to collect hate crime statistics. <ref name="adl">[http://www.adl.org/99hatecrime/state_hate_crime_laws.pdf State Hate Crime Laws], [[Anti-Defamation League]], June 2006. Retrieved 2007-05-04. </ref> . 

According to the [[FBI]] Hate Crime Statistics report for 2006, hate crimes increased nearly 8% nationwide, with a total of 7,722 incidents and 9,080 offenses reported by participating law enforcement agencies.  Of the 5,449 crimes against persons, 46% were classified as intimidation and 31.9% as simple assaults.  81% of the 3,593 crimes against property were acts of vandalism or destruction. <ref>Statistics, 2006 [http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2006/index.html Hate Crime Statistics, 2006], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]</ref> . 

However, according to the [[FBI]] Hate Crime Statistics for 2007, the number of hate crimes decreased to 7,624 incidents reported by participating law enforcement agencies. <ref>Statistics, 2007 [http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2007/table_02.htm Hate Crime Statistics, 2007], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]</ref> These incidents included 9 murders and 2 rapes(out of the almost 17,000 murders and 90,000 forcible rapes committed in the U.S. in 2007). <ref>Statistics, 2007 [http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2007/data/table_01.html FBI Crime in the United States 2007], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]</ref> . 

[[Attorney General]] Eric Holder said in June 2009 that recent killings show the need for a tougher U.S. hate crimes law to stop "violence masquerading as political activism". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31392054/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/ |title=Attorney general urges new hate crimes law – Crime & courts- msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2009-06-16 |accessdate=2011-11-14}}</ref> . 

===South America===. 
====Brazil====. 
In [[Brazil]], hate crime laws focus on [[racism]], racial [[injury]], and other special bias-motivated crimes such as, for example, murder by [[death squad]]s<ref>{{pt}} http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Leis/L8072.htm (Law 8072/1990, Article 1st, I)</ref> and [[genocide]] on the grounds of [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], race or religion. <ref>{{pt}} http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Leis/L2889.htm (Law 2889/1956, Article 1st)</ref> Murder by death squads and genocide are legally classified as "hideous crimes" (''crimes hediondos'' in Portuguese). <ref>Law 8072/1990 (aforementioned link), Article 1st, I and single paragraph. </ref> . 

The crimes of racism and racial injury, although similar, are enforced slightly differently. <ref>{{pt}} http://www.boletimjuridico.com.br/doutrina/texto.asp?id=662</ref> Article 140, 3rd paragraph, of the [[Penal Code]] establishes a harsher penalty, from a minimum of 1 year to a maximum of 3 years, for injuries motivated by "elements referring to race, color, [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], origin, or the condition of being an aged or [[disability|disabled person]]". <ref>{{pt}} http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Decreto-Lei/Del2848compilado.htm</ref> On the other side, Law 7716/1989 covers "crimes resulting from [[discrimination]] or [[prejudice]] on the grounds of race, color, ethnicity, religion, or national origin". <ref>{{pt}} http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Leis/L7716.htm</ref> . 

In addition, the Brazilian Constitution defines as a "fundamental goal of the Republic" (Article 3rd, clause IV) "to promote the wealth of all, with no prejudice as to [[nationality|origin]], race, sex, color, age, and any other forms of discrimination". <ref>{{pt}} http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao_Compilado.htm</ref> . 

==Support and opposition to hate crime laws==. 
{{Multiple issues|section=June 2009|unbalanced=June 2009|globalize=June 2009}} . 

===Support for hate crime laws===. 
Justifications for harsher punishments for hate crimes focus on the notion that hate crimes cause greater individual and societal harm. It is said that, when the core of a person’s identity is attacked, the degradation and [[dehumanization]] is especially severe, and additional emotional and physiological problems are likely to result. Society then, in turn, can suffer from the [[empowerment|disempowerment]] of a group of people. Furthermore, it is asserted that the chances for retaliatory crimes are greater when a hate crime has been committed. The [[riots]] in [[Los Angeles]], California that followed the beating of [[Rodney King]], a Black motorist, by a group of [[white people|White]] police officers are cited as support for this argument. <ref name = "tvccce"/> The beating of white truck driver [[Reginald Oliver Denny|Reginald Denny]] by black rioters during the same riot is also an example that would support this argument.  . 

In [[Wisconsin v. Mitchell]] the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] unanimously found that ''penalty-enhancement'' hate crime statutes do not conflict with [[free speech]] rights, because they do not punish an individual for exercising [[freedom of expression]]; rather, they allow courts to consider [[motive (law)|motive]] when sentencing a criminal for conduct which is not protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/supreme-court-drama/wisconsin-v-mitchell|accessdate=2011-10-12|title=Wisconsin v. Mitchell|publisher=Enotes.com}}</ref> . 

===Opposition to hate crime laws===. 
The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously found the St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance amounted to viewpoint-based discrimination is in conflict with rights of free speech, because it selectively criminalized bias-motivated speech or symbolic speech for disfavored topics while permitting such speech for other topics. <ref>[[R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul]], 505 U.S. 377 (1992). </ref> Many critics<!--keep reading, refs are there--> further assert that it conflicts with an even more fundamental right: free thought. The claim is that hate-crime legislation effectively makes certain ideas or beliefs, including religious ones, illegal, in other words, [[thought crime]]s. <ref>The Essayist (1998).

In their book ''Hate Crimes: Criminal Law and Identity Politics'', [[James B. Jacobs]] and Kimberly Potter criticize hate crime legislation for exacerbating conflicts between groups.  They assert that by defining crimes as being committed by one group against another, rather than as being committed by individuals against their society, the labeling of crimes as “hate crimes” causes groups to feel persecuted by one another, and that this impression of persecution can incite a backlash and thus lead to an actual increase in crime. <ref>Jacobs, James B. & Kimberly Potter. (1998). Hate Crimes: Criminal Law and Identity Politics. New York: Oxford University Press, pp. 130–144</ref> Some have argued hate crime laws bring the law into disrepute and further divide society, as groups apply to have their critics silenced. <ref>{{cite web|last=Troy |first=Daniel E. |url=http://www.aei.org/speech/17122 |title=AEI – Short Publications |publisher=Aei.org |date=1999-08-04 |accessdate=2011-11-14}}</ref> Some have argued that if it is true that all violent crimes are the result of the perpetrator's contempt for the victim, then all crimes are hate crimes. Thus, if there is no alternate rationale for prosecuting some people more harshly for the same crime based on who the victim is, then different defendants are treated unequally under the law, which violates the [[United States Constitution]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/99hatecrime/constitutionality.asp |title=Constitutional Challenges to Hate Crimes Statutes |publisher=Adl.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-14}}</ref> .
