The relationship between '''multiculturalism and Islam''' is an important aspect in the overall debate on the soundness of the modern doctrine of [[multiculturalism]].      . 

==Debate on issues surrounding multiculturalism==. 
===Backlash against multicultural policies===. 
In an article in the ''[[Hudson Review]]'', [[Bruce Bawer]], writes about what he sees as a developing distaste toward the idea and policies of multiculturalism in Europe, especially, as stated earlier, in the [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Austria]] and [[Germany]]. The belief behind this backlash on multiculturalism is that it creates friction within society. <ref>"[http://www.hudsonreview.com/bawerWi06.pdf Crisis in Europe]"</ref> . 

===Incompatibility with secular society===. 
Incompatibility with secular society has been influenced by a stance against multiculturalism advocated by recent philosophers, closely linked to the heritage of [[New Philosophers]]. <ref name="Modood">{{cite book | title=Multiculturalism, Muslims and Citizenship: A European Approach | author=Tariq Modood | publisher=Routledge | edition=1st |date=2006-04-06| isbn=978-0415355155 | pages=3, 29, 46}}</ref>  Fiery polemic on the subject by proponents like [[Pascal Bruckner]],<ref>[[Pascal Bruckner]] - [http://www.signandsight.com/features/1146.html Enlightenment fundamentalism or racism of the anti-racists?] originally appeared in German in the online magazine Perlentaucher on January 24, 2007. </ref> and Paul Cliteur has kindled international debate. <ref>[http://www.libertarian.nl/NL/archives/000198.php  Paul Cliteur, Moderne Papoea’s, Dilemma’s van een multiculturele samenleving, De Uitgeverspers, 2002]</ref> . 

Opinion polls among first and second generation muslim immigrants in western Europe show relatively little acceptance of secular ideas such as separation of religion and state, religious freedom, LGBT rights, gender equality and woman rights. In the UK, a Gallup poll showed that none of the 500 British Muslims polled believed homosexuality to be "morally acceptable", compared with 35% of the 1001 French Muslims polled. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/may/07/muslims-britain-france-germany-homosexuality | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Riazat | last=Butt | title=Muslims in Britain have zero tolerance of homosexuality, says poll | date=2009-05-07}}</ref> A 2007 survey of British muslims showed that 61 % believe homosexuality should be illegal, with up to 71 % of young British muslims holding this belief. 43% of polled muslims believed muslim woman should not be allowed to marry without the consent of her guardian, and 31% believed apostasy should be forbidden and punishable by death<ref>http://dvmx.com/British_Muslim_Youth.pdf</ref> . 

===Introduction of sharia in Western countries===. 
In Canada, the possible introduction of [[sharia]] family courts became a contentious issue, and received much media attention. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/3599264.stm ''Will Canada introduce Sharia law?''], ''BBC News'', 26 August 2004. </ref><ref>Richard Fidler, 2006.

===Hostility towards Muslims===. 
A survey showed that 18% in Britain think that "a large proportion of British Muslims feel no sense of loyalty to this country and are prepared to condone or even carry out acts of terrorism". <ref>Daily Telegraph. ''[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1527192/Islam-poses-a-threat-to-the-West%2C-say-53pc-in-poll.html Islam poses a threat to the West, say 53% in poll]''. 25 August 2006. </ref> A TNS/Global poll showed that 79% in Britain would feel "uncomfortable living next to a Muslim". <ref>Daily Star, 8 September 2006, quoted at [http://www.islamophobia-watch.com/islamophobia-watch/2006/9/8/most-brits-dont-trust-muslims.html Islamophobia Watch]</ref> There have also been notable tensions in Britain between established Muslim communities and newly-arrived Eastern European immigrants. <ref>[http://www.thepressnewspaper.co.uk/NewsDetails.asp?id=1169 ‘War’ on the streets]</ref> A major attitude survey of teenagers in [[Flanders]] showed that 75% refuse to have a relationship with a black person, a Muslim, or an immigrant. Half want all immigration stopped, and 41% say they distrust anyone from another ethnic background. <ref>''[http://www.trouw.nl/nieuws/europa/article1378535.ece Meeste Vlaamse jongeren afkerig van buitenlanders]'', Trouw, 2 October 2006. </ref> . 

[[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British cabinet]] ministers had been criticized in October 2006 for helping to "unleash a public anti-Muslim backlash" in the United Kingdom by blaming the [[Islam in the United Kingdom|Muslim community]] over issues of integration despite a study commissioned by the [[Home Office]] on white and [[British Asian|Asian]]-Muslim youths demonstrating "White youths are more likely to believe they are superior to those from other races, and their attitudes are more of a barrier to integration than those of Muslims". <ref name=Dood>{{cite web|title=White pupils less tolerant, survey shows|author=Vikram Dood|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=21 October 2006|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2006/oct/21/schools.religion|accessdate=2010-04-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Muslim students 'more tolerant'|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=11 October 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lancashire/6033155.stm|accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref> A Europe-wide survey by [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] in May 2009 also found that the [[Islam in Europe|Muslim communities]] in Britain, Germany and France felt more patriotic towards those countries compared to the  general populations as a whole,<ref name=Gallup>{{cite web|title=Poll: European Muslims more patriotic than average populace|publisher=[[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]]|date=07/05/2009|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1083892.html|accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Muslims more patriotic than Brits|publisher=Politics|date=7 May 2009|author=Ian Dunt|url=http://www.politics.co.uk/news/equality/muslims-more-patriotic-than-brits-$1293822.htm|accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref> while another survey found that Muslims supported the role of Christianity in British life more so than Christians themselves. <ref>{{cite web|title=79 per cent of Muslims say Christianity should have strong role in Britain|author=Nick Allen|date=24 February 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/4799345/79-per-cent-of-Muslims-say-Christianity-should-have-strong-role-in-Britain.html|accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref> .
