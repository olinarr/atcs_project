'''Eurabia''' is a social-political neologism which refers to the alleged [[Arabization]] and [[Islamization]] of Europe, and the European leaders' alleged capitulation to [[Islam]]ic influences. <ref name="betrayal"> "This government is enthusiastically co-operating with the Islamization of the Netherlands.

==Origin of the term==. 
''Eurabia'' was originally the title of a newsletter published by the ''Comité européen de coordination des associations d'amitié avec le monde Arabe''. <ref>{{fr}} [http://www.worldcat.org/title/eurabia/oclc/5966570 WorldCat.org], [http://www-bu.univ-paris8.fr/web/collections/guide_vincennes_assia_melamed.pdf Archive list Universités de Paris]</ref> According to [[Bat Ye'or]], it was published collaboratively with ''France-Pays Arabes'' (journal of the ''Association de solidarité franco-arabe'' or ASFA), ''Middle East International'' (London), and the ''Groupe d'Etudes sur le Moyen-Orient'' (Geneva). <ref name="Yeor1">[[Bat Ye'or]], ''[http://www.dhimmitude.org/archive/by_eurabia.doc Le dialogue Euro-Arabe et la naissance d'Eurabia]'', [http://obs.monde.juif.free.fr/pdf/omj04-05.pdf#page=44 Observatoire du Monde Juif], December 2002, [http://www.dhimmitude.org/archive/by_eurabia_122002_eng.doc English translation]</ref> During the [[1973 oil crisis]], the [[European Economic Community]] (predecessor of the [[European Union]]), had entered into the [[Euro-Arab Dialogue]] (EAD) with the [[Arab League]]. <ref>[http://www.medea.be/ MEDEA]: [http://www.medea.be/?doc=55&lang=en Euro-Arab dialogue]</ref> Bat Ye'or later used the [[:fr:Eurabia (revue)|journal title ''Eurabia'']] in her books.  . 

In her 2005 book ''Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis'', Bat Ye'or claims that Eurabia is the result of the [[Euro-Arab Dialogue|French-led European policy]] originally intended to increase European power against the United States by aligning its interests with those of the Arab countries. She claims it as a primary cause of European hostility to Israel, referring to joint Euro-Arab foreign policies that she characterizes as [[anti-American]] and [[anti-Zionist]].{{cn|date=January 2012}} The term is generally used in combination with "[[dhimmitude]]", denoting an alleged attitude of concession, surrender and [[appeasement]] towards Islam. Her definition of Eurabia is: . 

{{cquote|Eurabia is a geo-political reality envisaged in 1973 through a system of informal alliances between, on the one hand, the nine countries of the European Community (EC) which, enlarged, became the European Union (EU) in 1992 and on the other hand, the Mediterranean Arab countries. The alliances and agreements were elaborated at the top political level of each EC country with the representative of the European Commission, and their Arab homologues with the Arab League's delegate. This system was synchronised under the roof of an association called the Euro-Arab Dialogue (EAD) created in July 1974 in Paris. <ref name="Yeor4">for those who do, see especially "Eurabia represents a geo-political reality" and "Western Europe [...] future is Eurabia. Period.", Bat Ye'or quoted by Jamie Glazov, ''[http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/Printable.asp?ID=15044 Eurabia]'', Front Page Magazine, 2004-09-21</ref> }} .

According to Marján and Sapir, the very idea of "Eurabia" is "based on an extremist conspiracy theory, according to which Europe and the Arab states would join forces to make life impossible for [[Israel]] and Islamize the old continent."<ref>{{cite book |title= Europe's Destiny |last=Marján |first=Attila |authorlink= |coauthors=André Sapir |year=2010 |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |location= |isbn= 0801895472 |page= 161 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> . 

Writing in ''[[Race & Class]]'' in 2006, author and freelance journalist [[Matt Carr]] argued that Eurabia had moved from "an outlandish conspiracy theory" to a more mainstream and "dangerous Islamophobic fantasy". He observed that Ye'or's "book ha[d] been well received, not only by established heralds of the Islamic threat, such as Melanie Phillips, Daniel Pipes and Oriana Fallaci, but by respected historians such as Niall Ferguson and Churchill’s biographer Martin Gilbert, who, whatever their political views, might at least be expected to recognise the absence of historical discipline or methodology when they see it." Carr proposed that the idea of Eurabia was a "paranoid" but "politically convenient" fantasy, and that its "popularity... in this circle" served "to legitimise the broader neocon social and economic agenda". <ref>[http://rac.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/48/1/1 Matt Carr, ''You are now entering Eurabia'']</ref> . 

[[Justin Vaisse]], co-author of ''Integrating Islam Political and Religious Challenges in Contemporary France'', seeks to discredit what he calls, "four myths of the alarmist school," using [[Islam in France|Muslims in France]] as an example. Specifically he wrote that the Muslim population growth rate was lower than that predicted by Eurabia, partly because the [[fertility rate]] of immigrants declines with integration. <ref>See also [http://demographymatters.blogspot.com/2008/02/demographic-spectres-and-politics.html Randy McDonald], ''[http://rfmcdpei.livejournal.com/408410.html France, its Muslims, and the Future]'', 2004-04-13, [[Doug Saunders]], "[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080920.wreckoning20/BNStory/International/home/ The 'Eurabia' myth deserves a debunking]", ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', 2008-09-20, ''[http://www.scb.se/templates/pressinfo____251100.asp Fewer differences between foreign born and Swedish born childbearing women]'', [[Statistics Sweden]], 2008-11-03<!-- thanks to http://gatesofvienna.blogspot.com/2008/11/gates-of-vienna-news-feed-1132008.html#3416 -->, Mary Mederios Kent, ''[http://www.prb.org/Articles/2008/muslimsineurope.aspx?p=1 Do Muslims have more children than other women in western Europe?]'', [[Population Reference Bureau]], prb.org, February 2008; for fertility of Muslims outside Europe, see the sentence "The dramatic decline in Iran's fertility provides a recent example of how strict Islamic practices can coexist with widespread use of [[Family planning in Iran|family planning]].", and (the articles) Farzaneh Roudi-Fahimi and Mary Mederios Kent, ''[http://www.prb.org/Articles/2008/menafertilitydecline.aspx?p=1 Fertility Declining in the Middle East and North Africa]'', prb.org, April 2008, especially the [http://www.prb.org/images08/patterns-of-fertility.gif figure 2], Mohammad Jalal Abbasi-Shavazi, ''[http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/completingfertility/2RevisedABBASIpaper.PDF Recent changes and the future of fertility in Iran]'', especially the [http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/completingfertility/2RevisedABBASIpaper.PDF#page=10 figure 1];<!-- Even [http://gatesofvienna.blogspot.com/2008/10/gates-of-vienna-news-feed-10272008.html#3081 Gates of Vienna acknowledge] by quoting [http://yoramettinger.newsnet.co.il/Front/NewsNet/reports.asp?reportId=248042 Yoram Ettinger], 2[http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1225036811974&pagename=JPost%252FJPArticle%252FPrinter Demographic implosion in Muslim societies]", ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', 2008-10-28; --></ref> He further points out that Muslims are not a monolithic or cohesive group,<ref>See also "Merely speaking of a 'Muslim community in France' can be misleading and inaccurate: like every immigrant population, Muslims in France exhibit strong cleavages based on the country of their origin, their social background, political orientation and ideology, and the [[Divisions of Islam|branch or sect of Islam]] that they practice (when they do)." in Justin Vaisse, ''[http://www.brookings.edu/testimony/2006/0112france_vaisse.aspx Unrest in France, November 2005]'', 2006-01-12</ref> and that many Muslims do seek to integrate politically and socially.

[[David Aaronovitch]] writes that the proponents of Eurabia confuse Islamists with mainstream Muslims. He acknowledges that the threat of "jihadist terror" may be real, but that there was no threat of Eurabia. Aaronovitch concludes that those of study conspiracy theories will recognize Eurabia to be a theory that combines the [[Useful idiots|Sad Dupes]] thesis to the [[Fifth column|Enemy Within]] idea. <ref name="DA">{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/david_aaronovitch/article590235.ece|title=It's the latest disease: sensible people saying ridiculous things about Islam|accessdate=2008-03-08|author=[[David Aaronovitch]]|date=2005-11-15|publisher=The Times | location=London}}</ref></blockquote> . 

The Eurabia theory has been compared by British columnist [[Johann Hari]] to historically [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] writing. He calls the two "startlingly similar" and says that "there are intellectuals on the British right who are propagating a conspiracy theory about Muslims that teeters very close to being a 21st century [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion|Protocols of the Elders of Mecca]]."<ref>[[Johann Hari|Hari, Johann]].

In his book ''Wars of Blood and Faith'', US military analyst [[Ralph Peters]] states that far from being about to take over Europe through demographic change, "Europe's Muslims are living on borrowed time" and that in the event of a major terrorist attack in Europe, thanks to the "ineradicable viciousness" of Europeans and what he perceives as a historical tendency to over-react to real or perceived threats, European Muslims "will be lucky if they're only deported."<ref>{{cite book|title=Wars of blood and faith: the conflicts that will shape the twenty-first century|pages=333–334|first=Ralph |last=Peters|publisher=Stackpole Books|year=2007|isbn=9780811702744}}</ref> . 

Eric Kaufmann, author of ''Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth: Demography and Politics in the Twenty-First Century'' (2011), argues that a Muslim majority is extremely unlikely in Europe in the near or long-term. He states "Even if higher Muslim fertility rates do not persist, Islam will make a significant imprint on European life—so saner Eurabian ideas should be publicly discussed. Nonetheless, the overwhelming weight of demographic evidence points towards a decline in Muslim fertility and a more plural Europe."<ref>Kaufmann, Eric (20 March 2010).

Historian [[Walter Laqueur]], author of ''The Last Days of Europe: Epitaph for an Old Continent'', has written that "the fears that Europe risks becoming a Muslim-dominated Eurabia, adopting [[Sharia]], are a vast distortion of the views of serious students of Europe's present state and future prospects". He notes that Muslim immigrants to Europe come from many different countries, the majority non-Arab, and that they have "common interests... but also great differences, even in their attitudes to religion". <ref name=Laqueur2009p211>[[Walter Laqueur]] (2009).
