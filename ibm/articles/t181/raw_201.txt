'''Multiculturalism''' is an ideology that promotes the institutionalisation of communities containing multiple [[culture]]s. It is generally applied to the [[demographics|demographic make-up]] of a specific place, usually at the organizational level, e.g. [[school]]s, [[business]]es, [[neighborhood]]s, [[city|cities]], or [[nation]]s.  . 

In a political context the term is used for a wide variety of meanings, ranging from the advocacy of equal respect to the various cultures in a society, to a policy of promoting the maintenance of [[cultural diversity]], to policies in which people of various [[ethnic]] and [[religion|religious]] groups are addressed by the authorities as defined by the group they belong to. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Multiculturalism |title=Dictionary.Reference.com |publisher=Dictionary.Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref><ref name="guardianmalik">{{cite news|author=Kenan Malik|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/mar/17/multiculturalism-diversity-political-policy |title=Guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=2010-03-17 |accessdate=2010-12-10 |location=London}}</ref> A common aspect of many such policies is that they avoid presenting any specific ethnic, religious, or cultural community [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] as central. <ref name="Cotter2011">{{cite book|author=Anne-Marie Mooney Cotter|title=Culture clash: an international legal perspective on ethnic discrimination|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0AcvVUevrMYC&pg=PA13|date=28 February 2011|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-1936-5|page=13}}</ref> . 

Multiculturalism is often contrasted with the concepts of [[cultural assimilation|assimilationism]] and has been described as a "[[Salad bowl (cultural idea)|salad bowl]]" or "[[cultural mosaic]]" rather than a "[[melting pot]]."<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=TuggI-Ye_AUC&lpg=PA31&dq=Cultural%20mosaic%20Canada&pg=PA31#v=onepage&q&f=true|page=31|title=Guide to Western Canada|edition=7th|first1=Ann Carroll|last1= Burgess|first2=Tom |last2=Burgess|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|year=2005|isbn=0-7627-2987-2|accessdate = 2011-01-16}}</ref> .

*The first focuses on interaction and communication between different cultures. Interactions of cultures provide opportunities for the cultural differences to communicate and interact to create multiculturalism. 
*The second centers on diversity and cultural uniqueness. Cultural isolation can protect the uniqueness of the local culture of a nation or area and also contribute to global cultural diversity.  .

===Introductory to monoculturalism=== . 

Multiculturalism, as generally understood, refers to a theoretical approach and a number of policies adopted in Western [[nation-state]]s, which had seemingly achieved a de facto single national identity during the 18th and/or 19th centuries. <ref name="ZarateLevy2011">{{cite book|author1=Geneviève Zarate|author2=Danielle Levy|author3=Claire Kramsch|title=Handbook of Multilingualism and Multiculturalism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DYL4_6SvxewC&pg=PA377|date=19 April 2011|publisher=Archives contemporaines|isbn=978-2-8130-0039-2|page=377}}</ref> Many nation-states in Africa, Asia, and the Americas are culturally diverse, and are 'multi-cultural' in a [[descriptive]] sense. In some, [[communalism]] is a major political issue. The policies adopted by these states often have parallels with multicultural-ist policies in the [[Western world]], but the historical background is different, and the goal may be a mono-cultural or mono-ethnic [[nation-building]] - for instance in the Malaysian government's attempt to create a 'Malaysian race' by 2020. <ref>[[The Economist]]: ''[http://www.economist.com/surveys/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1677228 The changing of the guard]'', April 3rd 2003. </ref> .

In the United States, multiculturalism is not clearly established in policy at the federal level.

In academic sociology, the strongest definitions of multiculturalism as a form of segregation mainly emerge from the USA. <ref>Crouch, Colin, "Social Change in Western Europe", OUP 1999, p.291</ref> Here, multiculturalism is seen as requiring that the host society facilitate (whether actively, or passively through an absence of assimilatory pressure) the maintenance of minority language, history, and other aspects of minority culture.  .

In ''Pluralistic Universe'' (1909), William James espoused the idea of a "[[plural society]]."  James saw pluralism as "crucial to the formation of philosophical and social [[humanism]] to help build a better, more egalitarian society. <ref name=Boening>{{cite news

The educational approach to multiculturalism has since spread to the grade school system, as school systems try to rework their curricula to introduce students to diversity earlier—often on the grounds that it is important for minority students to see themselves represented in the classroom. <ref name="Volk2004">{{cite book|author=Terese M.

Historically, Europe has always been a mixture of Latin, Slavic, Germanic, Uralic, Celtic, Hellenic, Illyrian, Thracian and other cultures influenced by the importation of Hebraic, Christian, Muslim and other belief systems; although the continent was supposedly unified by the super-position of Imperial Roman Christianity, it is accepted that geographic and cultural differences continued from antiquity into the modern age. <ref name="OstergrenBossé2011">{{cite book|author1=Robert C. Ostergren|author2=Mathias Le Bossé|title=The Europeans: A Geography of People, Culture, and Environment|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=y-1fwix23zMC&pg=PA226|date=7 March 2011|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-59385-384-6|page=226}}</ref> . 

In the 19th century, the ideology of [[nationalism]] transformed the way Europeans thought about the [[State (polity)|state]]. <ref name="OstergrenBossé2011"/> Existing states were broken up and new ones created; the new [[nation-states]] were founded on the principle that each [[nation]] is entitled to its own [[sovereignty]] and to engender, protect, and preserve its own unique culture and history. Unity, under this ideology, is seen as an essential feature of the nation and the nation-state—unity of descent, unity of culture, unity of language, and often unity of religion. The nation-state constitutes a culturally [[wiktionary:Homogeneity|homogeneous]] society, although some national movements recognized regional differences.  . 

Where cultural unity was insufficient, it was encouraged and enforced by the state. <ref name="Kaplan"/> The 19th-century nation-states developed an array of policies—the most important was compulsory [[primary education]] in the [[national language]]. <ref name="Kaplan">{{cite book|author=Guntram Henrik Herb, David H. Kaplan|title=Nations and Nationalism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2UoQ-ueHjdEC&pg=PA522|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-907-8|page=522}}</ref> The language itself was often standardized by a linguistic academy, and regional languages were ignored or suppressed. Some nation-states pursued violent policies of [[cultural assimilation]] and even [[ethnic cleansing]]. <ref name="Kaplan"/> . 

Some European Union countries have introduced policies for "social cohesion", "integration", and (sometimes) "assimilation". The policies include:
*compulsory courses and/or tests on [[historiography and nationalism|national history]], on the [[constitution]] and the [[legal system]] (e.g., the computer-based test for individuals seeking naturalization in the UK named [[Life in the United Kingdom test]])
*introduction of an official national history, such as the national [[Western canon|canon]] defined for the Netherlands by the [[Frits van Oostrom|van Oostrom]] Commission,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.entoen.nu/ |title=Official Web site |publisher=Entoen.nu |date= |accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref> and promotion of that history (e.g., by exhibitions about [[Folk hero|national heroes]])
*tests designed to elicit "unacceptable" values. In [[Baden-Württemberg]] immigrants are asked what they would do if their son says he is a [[Homosexuality|homosexual]]. (The desired answer is that they would accept it). <ref>BBC report at [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4655240.stm News.BBC.co.uk], full list of questions in German at [http://www.taz.de/index.php?id=archivseite&dig=2006/01/04/a0154 TAZ.de]</ref>

Other countries have instituted policies which encourage cultural separation. The concept of “[[Cultural exception]]” proposed by France in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations in 1993 was an example of a measure aimed at protecting local cultures. <ref name="GraberNenova2008">{{cite book|author1=Christoph Beat Graber|author2=Mira Burri Nenova|title=Intellectual property and traditional cultural expressions in a digital environment|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gK6OI0hrANsC&pg=PA87|date=30 November 2008|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84720-921-4|pages=87–88}}</ref> .

The term ''multiculturalism'' is not much used in India. Within Indian culture, the term ''[[diversity]]'' is more commonly used.  . 

Religiously, the [[Hindus]] form the majority, followed by the Muslims. The actual statistics are: [[Hindu]] (80.5%), [[Muslim]] (13.4%, including both Shia and Sunni), [[Christian]] (2.3%), [[Sikh]] (2.1%), [[Buddhist]], [[Bahá'í Faith in India|Bahá'í]], [[Jain]], [[Jew]] and [[Parsi people|Parsi]] populations. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/ |title=Indian Census |publisher=Censusindia.gov.in |date= |accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref> Linguistically, the two main language families in India are [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] (a branch of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]) and [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]]. India officially follows a three-language policy. [[Hindi]] (spoken just like Urdu) is the federal official language, [[Indian English|English]] has the federal status of associate/subsidiary official language and each state has its own state official language (in the Hindi ''[[sprachraum]]'', this reduces to bilingualism). [[The Republic of India]]'s state boundaries are largely drawn based on linguistic groups; this decision led to the preservation and continuation of local ethno-linguistic sub-cultures, except for the Hindi ''sprachraum'' which is itself divided into many states. Thus, most states differ from one another in [[languages of India|language]], [[culture of India|culture]], [[Indian cuisine|cuisine]], [[Clothing in India|clothing]], [[Indian literature|literary style]], [[architecture of India|architecture]], [[music of India|music]] and festivities.

Indonesia's national motto, "Bhinneka tunggal ika" ("Unity in Diversity" lit. "many, yet one"), articulates the diversity that shapes the country. Due to migration within Indonesia (as part of government [[transmigration program]]s or otherwise), there are significant populations of ethnic groups who reside outside of their traditional regions. Soon after the fourth Indonesian President, [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] came into power in 1999, he quickly abolished some of the discriminatory laws in efforts to improve race relationships. [[Chinese Indonesian]]s are now in the era of rediscovery. Many younger generations, who cannot speak Mandarin due to the ban decades earlier, choose to learn Mandarin, as many learning centers open throughout the country.

===Malaysia===. 
{{Main|Ketuanan Melayu}}
[[Malaysia]] is a multiethnic country, with [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malays]] making up the majority, close to 52% of the population. About 24.6% of the population are [[Chinese Malaysian|Malaysians of Chinese descent]]. [[Indian Malaysian|Malaysians of Indian descent]] comprise about 7% of the population. The remaining 10% comprises:
* Native [[East Malaysia]]ns, namely [[Bajau]], [[Bidayuh]], [[Dusun]], [[Iban]], [[Kadazan]], [[Melanau]], [[Orang Ulu]], [[Sarawakian Malay]]s, etc. 
* Other native tribes of [[Peninsular Malaysia]], such as the [[Orang Asli]] and Siamese people, and
* Non-native tribes of Peninsular Malaysia such as the [[Chettiar]]s, the [[Peranakan]] and the Portuguese.  . 

The [[Malaysian New Economic Policy]] or NEP serves as a form of affirmative action (see [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputera]]). <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6237328.stm Malaysia fury at EU envoy remarks], BBC News</ref> It promotes structural changes in various aspects of life from education to economic to social integration. Established after the [[May 13 Incident|May 13 racial riots]] of 1969, it sought to address the significant imbalance in the economic sphere where the minority [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] population had substantial control over commercial activity in the country.  . 

The [[Malay Peninsula]] has a long history of international trade contacts, influencing its ethnic and religious composition. Predominantly [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] before the 18th century, the ethnic composition changed dramatically when the British introduced new industries, and imported Chinese and Indian labor. Several regions in the then [[British Malaya]] such as [[Penang]], [[Malacca]] and [[Singapore]] became Chinese dominated. Co-existence between the three ethnicities (and other minor groups) was largely peaceful, despite the fact the immigration affected the demographic and cultural position of the Malays.  . 

Preceding independence of the [[Federation of Malaya]], a [[social contract (Malaysia)|social contract]] was negotiated as the basis of a new society. The contract as reflected in the [[Constitution of Malaysia|1957 Malayan Constitution and the 1963 Malaysian Constitution]] states that the immigrant groups are granted citizenship, and Malays' special rights are guaranteed. This is often referred to the [[Bumiputra]] policy.  . 

These [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralist]] policies have come under pressure from racialist Malay parties, who oppose perceived subversion of Malay rights. The issue is sometimes related to the controversial [[status of religious freedom in Malaysia]].  .

Multiculturalism has been a characteristic feature of the island of [[Mauritius]]. <ref name="LionnetShi2005">{{cite book|author1=Françoise Lionnet|author2=Shumei Shi|title=Minor transnationalism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NJKgGEb2jpsC&pg=PA203|accessdate=29 January 2012|date=16 February 2005|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-3490-3|page=203}}</ref> Mauritian society includes people from many different ethnic and religious groups: Hindu, Muslim and Sikh [[Indo-Mauritian]]s, [[Mauritian Creole people|Mauritian Creoles]] (of African and [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] descent), Buddhist and Roman Catholic [[Sino-Mauritian]]s and [[Franco-Mauritian]]s (descendants of the original [[French people|French]] colonists). <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infomauritius.com/ |title=Some facts about Mauritius |publisher=Infomauritius.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref> . 

===Philippines===. 
The [[Philippines]] is the 8th most multiethnic nation in the world. <ref>The [[Philippines]] ranks 8th among 240 countries in terms of ethnic diversity. YEOH Kok Kheng, ''[http://www.fep.um.edu.my/working%20papers/2001/FEA-WP-2001-003.pdf Towards an Index of Ethnic Fractionalization]'', Table 1. </ref> It has 10 distinct major indigenous ethnic groups mainly the [[Bicolano people|Bicolano]], [[Ibanag people|Ibanag]], [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]], [[Ivatan people|Ivatan]], [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]], [[Moro (ethnic group)|Moro]], [[Pangasinense people|Pangasinense]], [[Sambal people|Sambal]], [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] and [[Visayan people|Visayan]]. The Philippines also has several aboriginal races such as the [[Bajau|Badjao]], [[Igorot]], [[Lumad]], [[Mangyan]] and [[Negrito]]s. The country also has considerable communities of [[American settlement in the Philippines|American]], [[Arab settlement in the Philippines|Arabic]], [[Chinese Filipinos|Chinese]], [[Indians in the Philippines|Indian]], and [[Filipinos of Spanish descent|Hispanic]] descent, and other ethnicities from other countries. The Philippine government has various programs supporting and preserving the nation's ethnic diversity. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2794.htm |title=State.gov |publisher=State.gov |date=2010-10-29 |accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref> . 

===Singapore===. 
Besides [[English Language|English]], Singapore recognizes three other languages, namely, [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Malay language|Malay]] as its official languages, with [[Malay language|Malay]] being the national language. Besides being a [[multilingualism|multilingual]] country, Singapore also acknowledges festivals celebrated by these three ethnic communities.  . 

During the British colonial rule, there are areas which are enclaves containing a large population of certain ethnic groups exist in areas such as [[Chinatown, Singapore|Chinatown]], [[Geylang]] and [[Little India, Singapore|Little India]] in Singapore. Presently <sup>(2010)</sup>, remnants of the colonial ethnic concentration still exists but housing in Singapore is governed by the Ethnic Integration Policy. <ref>(n.d.) In [[Housing and Development Board|Housing Development Boards of Singapore website]] Retrieved on Nov 18, 2010 from  [http://www.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10296p.nsf/PressReleases/C515273FA068DD58482576DD00169155?OpenDocument ''Policy Changes To Support An Inclusive And Cohesive Home'']</ref> The current Indian/Others ethnic limits are 10% and 13%, the limits for Malays are 22% and 25%, the limits for Chinese are 84% and 87% for the maximum ethnic limits for a neighborhood and a block respectively.  . 

===South Korea===. 
[[South Korea]] is among the world's most ethnically homogeneous nations. <ref>"[http://aparc.stanford.edu/news/koreas_ethnic_nationalism_is_a_source_of_both_pride_and_prejudice_according_to_giwook_shin_20060802/ Korea's ethnic nationalism is a source of both pride and prejudice, according to Gi-Wook Shin]". The Korea Herald. August 2, 2006. </ref> Those who do not share such features are often rejected by the Korean society or face discrimination. <ref>"[http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/CMTS/MonoPaper3-13.html The Life Instability of Intermarried Japanese Women in Korea]", Eung-Ryul Kim (Korea University and University of Southern California, The Center for Multiethnic and Transnational Studies)</ref> . 

However, the word "multiculturalism" is increasingly heard in South Korea. In 2007, Han Geon-Soo, Professor of Cultural Anthropology at [[Kangwon National University]], published an article entitled "Multicultural Korea: Celebration or Challenge of Multiethnic Shift in Contemporary Korea?", noting: "As the increase of foreign migrants in Korea transforms a single-ethnic homogenous Korean society into multiethnic and multicultural one, Korean government and the civil society pay close attention to multiculturalism as an alternative value to their policy and social movement." He argued, however, that "the current discourses and concerns on multiculturalism in Korea" lacked "the constructive and analytical concepts for transforming a society". <ref>Han Geon-Soo, "Multicultural Korea: Celebration or Challenge of Multiethnic Shift in Contemporary Korea?", ''Korea Journal'', Vol.47 No.4, Winter 2007, pp.32-63</ref> . 

The same year, Stephen Castles of the International Migration Institute argued:
:''"Korea no longer has to decide whether it wants to become a multicultural society. It made that decision years ago – perhaps unconsciously – when it decided to be a full participant in the emerging global economy. It confirmed that decision when it decided to actively recruit foreign migrants to meet the economic and demographic needs of a fast-growing society. Korea is faced by a different decision today: what type of multicultural society does it want to be?"''<ref>Stephen Castles, [http://www.imi.ox.ac.uk/pdfs/SC%20paper%20on%20MC%20soc%20for%20GHFR%20Korea%202007.pdf "Will Labour Migration lead to a Multicultural Society in Korea?", Global Human Resources Forum 2007 / International Migration Institute]</ref> . 

The ''[[Korea Times]]'' suggested in 2009 that South Korea was likely to become a multicultural society. <ref>[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2010/10/123_57884.html "Multiculturalism Likely to Prevail in Korea"], Lee Hyo-sik, ''Korea Times'', December 24, 2009</ref> In 2010, ''[[JoongAng Daily]]'' reported: "Media in Korea is abuzz with the new era of multiculturalism. With more than one million foreigners in Korea, 2 percent of the population comes from other cultures." It added:
:''"If you stay too long, Koreans become uncomfortable with you. [...] Having a 2 percent foreign population unquestionably causes ripples, but having one million temporary foreign residents does not make Korea a multicultural society. [...] In many ways, this homogeneity is one of Korea’s greatest strengths. Shared values create harmony. Sacrifice for the nation is a given. Difficult and painful political and economic initiatives are endured without discussion or debate. It is easy to anticipate the needs and behavior of others. It is the cornerstone that has helped Korea survive adversity. But there is a downside, too. [...] Koreans are immersed in their culture and are thus blind to its characteristics and quirks. Examples of group think are everywhere. Because Koreans share values and views, they support decisions even when they are obviously bad. Multiculturalism will introduce contrasting views and challenge existing assumptions. While it will undermine the homogeneity, it will enrich Koreans with a better understanding of themselves."<ref>[http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2925120 "Multiculturalism in Korea"], ''JoongAng Daily'', August 26, 2010</ref> . 

==Support for multiculturalism==. 
Multiculturalism is seen by its supporters as a fairer system that allows people to truly express who they are within a society, that is more tolerant and that adapts better to social issues. <ref>{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/mar/22/multiculturalism-blame-culture-segregation |title=Guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=2010-03-22 |accessdate=2010-12-10 |location=London |first=Antony |last=Lerman}}</ref> They argue that culture is not one definable thing based on one race or religion, but rather the result of multiple factors that change as the world changes.  . 

Historically, support for modern multiculturalism stems from the changes in Western societies after World War II, in what Susanne Wessendorf calls the "human rights revolution", in which the horrors of institutionalized racism and [[ethnic cleansing]] became almost impossible to ignore in the wake of the [[Holocaust]]; with the collapse of the [[Colonial empire|European colonial system]], as colonized nations in Africa and [[Imperialism in Asia|Asia]] successfully [[African independence movements|fought for their independence]] and pointed out the racist underpinnings of the colonial system; and, in the United States in particular, with the rise of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], which criticized ideals of [[assimilation]] that often led to prejudices against those who did not act according to Anglo-American standards and which led to the development of academic [[ethnic studies]] programs as a way to counteract the neglect of contributions by racial minorities in classrooms. <ref>Susanne Wessendorf, ''The multiculturalism backlash: European discourses, policies and practices'', p.35; accessed through Google Books, 12 February 2011. </ref><ref>Paul C. Gorski, [http://www.edchange.org/multicultural/papers/edchange_history.html "A Brief History of Multicultural Education"], EdChange.org, November 1999; accessed 12 February 2011. </ref> As this history shows, multiculturalism in Western countries was seen as a useful set of strategies to combat racism, to protect minority communities of all types, and to undo policies that had prevented minorities from having full access to the opportunities for freedom and equality promised by the [[liberalism]] that has been the hallmark of Western societies since the [[Age of Enlightenment]].  . 

C. James Trotman argues that multiculturalism is valuable because it "uses several disciplines to highlight neglected aspects of our social history, particularly the histories of women and minorities [...and] promotes respect for the dignity of the lives and voices of the forgotten. <ref name="Trotman2002">{{cite book|author=C. James Trotman|title=Multiculturalism: roots and realities|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ht8UKlutUaMC&pg=PR9|accessdate=29 January 2012|year=2002|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-34002-3|pages=9=10}}</ref>  By closing gaps, by raising consciousness about the past, multiculturalism tries to restore a sense of wholeness in a [[postmodern]] era that fragments human life and thought."<ref name="Trotman2002"/> . 

[[Tariq Modood]] argues that in the early years of the 21st Century, multiculturalism "is most timely and necessary, and [...] we need more not less", since it is "the form of integration" that (1) best fits the ideal of [[egalitarianism]], (2) has "the best chance of succeeding" in the "post-[[9/11]], post [[7/7]]" world, and (3) has remained "moderate [and] pragmatic". <ref name="Modood2007">{{cite book|author=Tariq Modood|title=Multiculturalism: a civic idea|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hlEMZuPhpWQC&pg=PA14|year=2007|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-3288-9|page=14}}</ref> . 

[[Bhikhu Parekh]] counters what he sees as the tendencies to equate multiculturalism with racial minorities "demanding special rights" and to see it as promoting a "thinly veiled racis[m]". Instead, he argues that multiculturalism is in fact "not about minorities" but "is about the proper terms of relationship between different cultural communities", which means that the standards by which the communities resolve their differences, e.g., "the principles of justice" must not come from only one of the cultures but must come "through an open and equal dialogue between them."<ref>{{cite book|last=Parekh|first=Bhikhu C.|title=Rethinking multiculturalism: cultural diversity and political theory|year=2002|publisher=Harvard UP|isbn=978-0-674-00995-0|page=13}}</ref> . 

==Opposition to multiculturalism==. 
{{Main|Criticism of multiculturalism}} . 

Critics of multiculturalism often debate whether the multicultural ideal of benignly co-existing cultures that interrelate and influence one another, and yet remain distinct, is sustainable, paradoxical, or even desirable. <ref name="Nagle2009">{{cite book|author=John Nagle|title=Multiculturalism's double bind: creating inclusivity, [[cosmopolitanism]] and difference|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zqMCc37dW1kC&pg=PA129|date=23 September 2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-7607-2|page=129}}</ref><ref name="Rajaee2000">{{cite book|author=Farhang Rajaee|title=Globalization on trial: the human condition and the information civilization|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZyAt3T1V4EcC&pg=PT97|date=May 2000|publisher=IDRC|isbn=978-0-88936-909-2|page=97}}</ref><ref name="SandercockAttili2009">{{cite book|author1=Leonie Sandercock|author2=Giovanni Attili|author3=Val Cavers|coauthors=Paula Carr|title=Where strangers become neighbours: integrating immigrants in Vancouver, Canada|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TmlGzr4s0uMC&pg=PA16|date=1 May 2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-9034-9|page=16}}</ref> It is argued that [[Nation states]], who would previously have been synonymous with a distinctive cultural identity of their own, lose out to enforced multiculturalism and that this ultimately erodes the host nations' distinct culture. <ref name="Report attacks multiculturalism">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4295318.stm |title=Report attacks multiculturalism |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-09-30 |accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref> . 

Harvard professor of political science [[Robert D. Putnam]] conducted a nearly decade long study how multiculturalism affects social trust. <ref name="Putnam, Robert D. 2007">Putnam, Robert D., "E Pluribus Unum: Diversity and Community in the Twenty-first Century -- The 2006 Johan Skytte Prize," ''Scandinavian Political Studies'' 30 (2), June 2007. </ref>  He surveyed 26,200 people in 40 American communities, finding that when the data were adjusted for class, income and other factors, the more racially diverse a community is, the greater the loss of trust.  People in diverse communities "don’t trust the local mayor, they don’t trust the local paper, they don’t trust other people and they don’t trust institutions," writes Putnam. <ref>Sailer, Steve, [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2007/jan/15/00007/ "Fragmented Future,"] ''American Conservative'', Jan. 15, 2007. </ref> In the presence of such ethnic diversity, Putnam maintains that . 

<blockquote>
[W]e hunker down. We act like turtles. The effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined. And it’s not just that we don’t trust people who are not like us. In diverse communities, we don’t trust people who do look like us. <ref name="Putnam, Robert D. 2007"/>
</blockquote> . 

Ethologist [[Frank Salter]] writes: . 

<blockquote>
Relatively homogeneous societies invest more in public goods, indicating a higher level of public altruism.  For example, the degree of ethnic homogeneity correlates with the government's share of gross domestic product as well as the average wealth of citizens.  Case studies of the United States, Africa and South-East Asia find that multi-ethnic societies are less charitable and less able to cooperate to develop public infrastructure.  Moscow beggars receive more gifts from fellow ethnics than from other ethnies [''sic''].  A recent multi-city study of municipal spending on public goods in the United States found that ethnically or racially diverse cities spend a smaller portion of their budgets and less per capita on public services than do the more homogenous cities. <ref>Salter, Frank, ''On Genetic Interests'', pg.146. </ref>
</blockquote> . 

[[Dick Lamm]], former three-term Democratic governor of the US state of [[Colorado]], wrote in his essay "I have a plan to destroy America": . 

:"Diverse peoples worldwide are mostly engaged in hating each other - that is, when they are not killing each other. A diverse, peaceful, or stable society is against most historical precedent."<ref>Richard D. Lamm, 2005, [http://www.snopes.com/politics/soapbox/lamm.asp I have a plan to destroy America], accessed 12 January 2011, Snopes.com. </ref> . 

In Aotearoa (New Zealand), which is officially bi-cultural, multiculturalism has been seen as a threat to Maori, and possibly an attempt by Pakeha (whites) to water down the growing strength of Maori demands for self determination.  http://alt.sagepub.com/content/33/1/29.abstract .
