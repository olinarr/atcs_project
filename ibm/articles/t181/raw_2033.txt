'''Cultural appropriation''' is the adoption of some specific elements of one culture by a different cultural group.  It describes [[acculturation]] or [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], but can imply a negative view towards acculturation from a minority culture by a dominant culture. <ref>Shaw, Helen.

Retrieved January 3, 2010. </ref>  It can include the introduction of forms of dress or personal adornment, [[music]] and [[art]], [[religion]], [[language]], or social behavior.  These elements, once removed from their [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] cultural contexts, can take on meanings that are significantly divergent from, or merely less nuanced than, those they originally held.  . 

Appropriation practice involves the 'appropriation' of ideas, symbols, artefacts, image, sound, objects, forms or styles from other cultures, from art history, from [[popular culture]] or other aspects of man made visual or non visual culture. <ref>[[Arnd Schneider]] (2003) ''[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=187627 On ‘appropriation’.

==Overview==. 
The term ''cultural appropriation'' can have a negative connotation. [[Cultural conservatism|Cultural conservatives]] apply it when the subject culture is a minority culture or somehow subordinated in social, political, economic, or military status to the appropriating culture; or, when there are other issues involved, such as a history of [[ethnic]] or [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] conflict between the two groups.  A more neutral term is [[cultural assimilation]] which does not imply blame.  . 

Cultural and racial theorist, [[George Lipsitz]], outlined this concept of cultural appropriation in his seminal term "strategic anti-essentialism." Strategic anti-essentialism is defined as the calculated use of a cultural form, outside of your own, to define yourself or your group. Strategic anti-essentialism can be seen both in minority cultures and majority cultures, and are not confined to only the appropriation of the other. For example, the American band [[Redbone (band)|Redbone]], composed of founding members of Mexican heritage, essentialized their group as belonging to the Native American tradition, and are known for their famous songs in support of the [[American Indian Movement]] "We Were All Wounded at Wounded Knee" and "Custer Had It Coming." However, as Lipsitz argues, when the majority culture attempts to strategically anti-essentialize themselves by appropriating a minority culture, they must take great care to recognize the specific socio-historical circumstances and significance of these cultural forms so as not to perpetuate the already existing, majority vs. minority, unequal power relations.  . 

Cultural appropriation may be defined differently in different cultures. While academics in a country such as the [[United States]], where racial dynamics had been a cause of cultural segmentation, may see many instances of intercultural communication as cultural appropriation, other countries may identify such communication as a [[melting pot]] effect.  . 

Cultural appropriation has also been seen as a site of resistance to dominant society when members of a marginalized group take and alter aspects of dominant culture to assert their agency and resistance.  This is exemplified in the novel ''Crick Crack, Monkey'' by [[Merle Hodge]] when those who are colonized appropriate the culture of the colonizers. Another historical example were the [[Mod (subculture)|Mods]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in the 1960s, working class youth who appropriated and exaggerated the highly tailored clothing of the upper middle class.  . 

==Arguments in favor==. 
Justin Britt-Gibson's article for the ''Washington Post'' looked at the appropriation of Jamaican culture by Italians and of other cultures by African-Americans as a sign of progress: . 

<blockquote>Throngs of [[dreadlocks|dreadlocked]] Italians were smoking joints, drinking beer, grooving to the rhythms of [[Bob Marley]], [[Steel Pulse]] and other [[reggae]] icons. Most striking was how comfortable these Italians seemed in their appropriated shoes, adopting a foreign culture and somehow making it theirs. The scene reinforced my sense of how far we've come since the days when people dressed, talked and celebrated only that which sprang from their own background. For the first time in my life, I was fully aware of the spiritual concept that we're all simply one. 
<p>
That sense hasn't left me. Everywhere I look, I see young people -- such as my two younger brothers, a Japanese-anime-obsessed 11-year-old and a pastel-Polo-sporting 21-year-old -- adopting styles, hobbies and attitudes from outside the culture in which they were raised. Last month in a Los Angeles barbershop, I was waiting to get my trademark Afro cut when I noticed a brother in his late teens sitting, eyes closed, as the barber clipped his hair into a "'frohawk", the punk-inspired African American adaptation of the mohawk. Asked why he chose the look, the guy, without looking up, shrugged, "Something different." Immediately, I understood. Minutes later, his "different" cut became my new look. <ref name="RacePost">Britt-Gibson, Justin.

Michael Lazarus, a Native American, in  his essay ''Anti-racist Measures Take Culture Away From Sports'' published by the Lowell Observer writes that the use of an ethnic symbol by a sports team is a progressive, liberal act that can be used by a culture to embrace history rather than hide from it. <ref name="Lazarus" /> .

==Examples==. 
A common sort of cultural appropriation is the adoption of the [[iconography]] of another culture. Examples include sports teams using [[Native America]]n [[tribal]] names, wearing jewelry with religious symbols such as the cross without any belief, appropriating other culture's history such as is claimed for Macedonia or Islamic traditions that Christian and Jewish prophets were Muslims, [[tattoos]] of [[Polynesia]]n tribal iconography, [[Chinese character]]s, or [[Celtic art|Celtic bands]] worn by people who have no interest in, or understanding of their original cultural significance. When these [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are regarded as objects that merely "look [[Cool (aesthetic)|cool]]", or when they are [[Mass production|mass produced]] cheaply as [[consumer]] [[kitsch]], people who venerate and wish to preserve their [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] cultural traditions may be offended. In [[Australia]], [[Australian Aboriginal|Aboriginal]] [[Australian Aboriginal art|artists]] have discussed an 'authenticity brand' to ensure consumers are aware of artworks claiming false Aboriginal significance. <ref>James, Marianne.

Historically, some of the most hotly debated cases of cultural appropriation have occurred in places where cultural exchange is the highest, such as along the trade routes in southwestern [[Asia]] and [[southeastern Europe]]. For instance, some scholars of the [[Ottoman empire]] and [[ancient Egypt]] argue that Ottoman and Egyptian architectural traditions have long been falsely claimed and praised as Persian or Arab,<ref>Ousterhout, Robert. [http://archnet.org/library/documents/one-document.tcl?document_id=8983 "Ethnic Identity and Cultural Appropriation in Early Ottoman Architecture."] Muqarnas Volume XII: An Annual on Islamic Art and Architecture. Leiden: E.J. Brill. 1995. Retrieved January 3, 2010. </ref> and [[Greco-Roman]], innovations, respectively.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} A more subtle example is brass band music [[trubaci]]. While this kind of music is almost exclusively performed by [[Romani people|Romani]] people, who may not consider themselves [[Serbs]], many people of Serbian origin consider this to be their own style. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} On the other hand, when the middle-class [[Slovenia]]n band [[Pankrti]] adopted the style of [[London]] [[punk music]] rooted in unemployment and other issues specific to the [[United Kingdom|UK]], it was seen in [[Yugoslavia]] as the spread of British culture and its adaptation to the local setting.  . 

[[African American culture]] historically has been the subject of a good deal of cultural appropriation, especially elements of its [[African American music|music]], dance, [[slang]], dress, and demeanor. (See [[blackface]] and [[Cool (aesthetic)|cool]].) For example, artists such as [[Eminem]], a white American who adopted a contemporary [[African American]] musical style may be perceived this way. Another prominent example of cultural appropriation is the use of real or imaginary elements of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] culture by [[North America]]n [[summer camp]]s, by organizations such as the [[Boy Scouts of America]], or by [[New Age]] [[guru]]s, some of whom put up for commercial wholesale, paraphernalia modelled on Native American healing traditions and techniques (see [[plastic shaman]]s). Many summer camps, and many age-segregated groups of campers within summer camps, are named after real Native American tribes ([[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]], [[Seminole]], etc.); [[tipi]]s are common at summer camps for example. The Boy Scout [[honor society]] is called the [[Order of the Arrow]]. Similarly, popular authors and non-indigenous self-styled teachers of [[Huna (New Thought)|Huna]] claim to be teaching authentic Native Hawaiian cultural practices, but often their notion of "Huna" is a synthesis of [[Freudian psychology]], [[New Thought]] and [[New Age]] metaphysical beliefs. Controversy has also arisen concerning the usage of the [[leprechaun]] mascot by the [[Boston Celtics]] basketball club and the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish]] football team. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Some people of [[Ireland|Irish]] ancestry see the usage as an example of cultural appropriation and even racism. Leprechauns appear in many [[Celtic mythology|Celtic mythological]] motifs, and the reduction of this mythological figure to a set of stereotypes and clichés may be perceived as offensive. <ref name="Lazarus">Lazarus, Michael.

In some cases, a culture usually viewed as the target of cultural appropriation can become implicated as the agent of appropriation, particularly after colonization and an extensive period re-organization of that culture under the [[nation-state]] system. For example, the government of [[Ghana]] has been accused of cultural appropriation in adopting the Caribbean [[Emancipation Day]] and marketing it to African American tourists as an "African festival". <ref>Hasty, J. "Rites of Passage, Routes of Redemption: Emancipation Tourism and the Wealth of Culture", ''Africa Today'', Volume 49, Number 3, Fall 2002, pp. 47-76. Indiana University Press.
