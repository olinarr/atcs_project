'''Criticism of [[multiculturalism]]''' questions the ideal of the maintenance of distinct ethnic cultures within one [[nation-state]]. Multiculturalism is a particular subject of debate in certain European nations that were once associated with a single, homogeneous, national cultural identity. <ref>{{cite web|author=Munira Mirza |url=http://www.spiked-online.com/Articles/0000000CA4C4.htm |title=spiked-culture &#124; Article &#124; Backlash against multiculturalism? |publisher=Spiked-online.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Kenan Malik |url=http://www.spiked-online.com/Articles/00000002D35E.htm |title=spiked-politics &#124; Article &#124; The trouble with multiculturalism |publisher=Spiked-online.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4295318.stm |title=Report attacks multiculturalism |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-09-30 |accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref>  Critics of multiculturalism may argue for [[Social integration|Cultural Integration]] of different ethnic and cultural groups to the existing laws and values of the country.

The response to multiculturalism in Australia has been varied, with a recent wave of opposition in the past decade. An anti-immigration party, the [[One Nation Party]], was formed by [[Pauline Hanson]] in the late 1990s. The party enjoyed brief electoral success, most notably in its home state of [[Queensland]], but is now electorally marginalized. One Nation called for the abolition of multiculturalism alleging that it represented "a threat to the very basis of the Australian culture, identity and shared values", arguing that there was "no reason why migrant cultures should be maintained at the expense of our shared, national culture.". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australianpolitics.com/parties/onenation/immigration-policy-98.shtml |title=One Nation's Immigration, Population and Social Cohesion Policy 1998 |publisher=Australianpolitics.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref> . 

A Federal Government proposal in 2006 to introduce a compulsory citizenship test, which would assess English skills and knowledge of Australian values, sparked renewed debate over the future of multiculturalism in Australia. [[Andrew Robb]], then Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, told a conference in November 2006 that some Australians worried the term "multicultural" had been transformed by interest groups into a philosophy that put "allegiances to original culture ahead of national loyalty, a philosophy which fosters separate development, a federation of ethnic cultures, not one community". He added: "A community of separate cultures fosters a rights mentality, rather than a responsibilities mentality. It is divisive. It works against quick and effective integration."<ref>[[The Courier Mail]]: National identity in spotlight, November 28, 2006 [http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,20832674-953,00.html]. </ref> The Australian citizenship test commenced in October 2007 for all new citizens between the ages of 18 and 60. <ref>[[Department of Immigration and Citizenship]]: Overview of the citizenship test [http://www.citizenship.gov.au/test/index.htm]</ref>  . 

In January 2007 the [[John Howard|Howard Government]] removed the word "multicultural" from the name of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, changing its name to the [[Department of Immigration and Citizenship (Australia)|Department of Immigration and Citizenship]].  . 

===Intellectual critique===. 
The earliest academic critics of multiculturalism in Australia were the philosophers Lachlan Chipman<ref>Lachlan Chipman (1980), 'The Menace of Multiculturalism,' in ''Quadrant'', Vol. 24, No. 10, October, pp.3-6</ref> and [[Frank Knopfelmacher]],<ref>Frank Knopfelmacher (1982), 'The case against multi-culturalism,' in Robert Manne (ed.), ''The New Conservatism in Australia'', Oxford University Press, Melbourne, Victoria, pages 40-66</ref> sociologist Tanya Birrell<ref>Tanya Birrell (1978), 'Migration and the Dilemmas of Multiculturalism,' in Robert Birrell and Colin Hay (eds.), ''The Immigration Issue in Australia, A Sociological Symposium'', Department of Sociology, School of Social Sciences, La Trobe University, Bundoora, Victoria, pages 132-146</ref> and the political scientist Raymond Sestito. <ref>Raymond Sestito (1982), ''The Politics of Multiculturalism'', The Centre for Independent Studies, Sydney, New South Wales (ISBN 0-949769-06-1)</ref> Chipman and Knopfelmacher were concerned with threats to social cohesion, while Birrell's concern was that multiculturalism obscures the social costs associated with large scale immigration that fall most heavily on the most recently arrived and unskilled immigrants. Sestito's arguments were based on the role of political parties. He argued that political parties were instrumental in pursuing multicultural policies, and that these policies would put strain on the political system and would not promote better understanding in the Australian community. <ref>Ibid, pages 30-36</ref><ref>Lyle Allan (1983), 'A Selective Annotated Bibliography of Multiculturalism', in ''Social Alternatives'' (University of Queensland), Vol.3, No.3, July, page 68</ref> . 

It was the high-profile historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], however, who first achieved mainstream recognition for the anti-multiculturalist cause when he wrote that multiculturalism threatened to transform Australia into a "cluster of tribes". In his 1984 book ''[[All for Australia]]'', Blainey criticized multiculturalism for tending to "emphasize the rights of ethnic minorities at the expense of the majority of Australians" and also for tending to be "anti-British", even though "people from the United Kingdom and Ireland form the dominant class of pre-war immigrants and the largest single group of post-war immigrants."  . 

According to Blainey, such a policy, with its "emphasis on what is different and on the rights of the new minority rather than the old majority," was unnecessarily creating division and threatened national cohesion. He argued that "the evidence is clear that many multicultural societies have failed and that the human cost of the failure has been high", and warned that "we should think very carefully about the perils of converting Australia into a giant multicultural laboratory for the assumed benefit of the peoples of the world."<ref>Blainey, G. (1984). ''All For Australia'', North Ryde, NSW: Methuen Haynes (ISBN 0-454-00828-7)</ref> Blainey wrote "For the millions of Australians who have no other nation to fall back upon, multiculturalism is almost an insult. It is divisive. It threatens social cohesion. It could, in the long-term, also endanger Australia's military security because it sets up enclaves which in a crisis could appeal to their own homelands for help." . 

Blainey remained a persistent critic of multiculturalism into the 1990s, denouncing multiculturalism as "morally, intellectually and economically ... a sham".  . 

Following the upsurge of support for the [[One Nation Party]] in 1996, [[Lebanon|Lebanese]]-born Australian anthropologist [[Ghassan Hage]] published a critique in 1997 of Australian multiculturalism in the book ''White Nation''. <ref>"Hage, G. (1997) White Nation: Fantasies of White supremacy in a multicultural society, Annandale, NSW: Pluto Press (ISBN  1-86403-056-9)"</ref> .

Canadian Daniel Stoffman's book "Who Gets In" questions the policy of Canadian multiculturalism.

==South Korea==. 
[[South Korea]] is among the world's most ethnically homogeneous nations. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://aparc.stanford.edu/news/koreas_ethnic_nationalism_is_a_source_of_both_pride_and_prejudice_according_to_giwook_shin_20060802/ |title=Korea's ethnic nationalism is a source of both pride and prejudice, according to Gi-Wook Shin |publisher=Aparc.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref> Historically, the country has tried hard to keep interaction between Koreans and non-Koreans as minimal as possible, forming a very distinct society. Koreans have traditionally valued an "unmixed blood" as the most important feature of Korean identity, often more important than their own lives{{Citation needed|reason="more important than their own lives" is very vague especially without the context provided by a citation|date=October 2011}}. Most Koreans tend to equate [[nationality]] or [[citizenship]] with membership in a single, homogeneous [[ethnic group]] sharing the same "blood" and history. A common language and culture are also viewed as important elements in Korean identity.  . 

Those who do not share such features are often rejected by the Korean society or face discrimination. <ref>[http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/CMTS/MonoPaper3-13.html The Life Instability of Intermarried Japanese Women in Korea], Eung-Ryul Kim (Korea University and University of Southern California, The Center for Multiethnic and Transnational Studies)</ref> This includes Koreans themselves who may not share one of the elements of Korean identity. For example, Koreans brought up overseas often face discrimination by Koreans living in South Korea upon their return who may not speak the language properly or have developed a different culture. North Koreans who immigrated to South Korea, despite sharing the same Korean blood and history, face discrimination as they do not share all of the elements of Korean identity, such as speaking the Korean language with an accent. Even South Koreans brought up in rural areas, who may speak with a distinct accent, face some form of discrimination by those in the cities of South Korea. Racial discrimination is not uncommon in South Korea and is sometimes seen as socially acceptable among South Koreans.  . 

The idea of multiracial or multiethnic nations, like Canada or the United States, is opposed in general and strikes many Koreans as odd or even contradictory. Relationships between Koreans and non-Koreans may be viewed skeptically by some South Koreans and often condemned. In particular, marriage between Koreans and Japanese is seen as undesirable and this can be attributed to the strong [[anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea]]. The term "Kosian", referring to someone who has a Korean father and a non-Korean mother, is considered offensive by some who prefer to identify themselves or their children as Korean. <ref>[http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/nation/200608/kt2006081319152111990.htm Myth of Pure-Blood Nationalism Blocks Multi-Ethnic Society in The Korean Times]{{Dead link|date=November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.naver.com/news/read.php?mode=LSS2D&office_id=079&article_id=0000076691&section_id=102&section_id2=257&menu_id=102 |title= '???'(Kosian) ?? ??!

In November 2005 [[John Sentamu]], the [[Archbishop of York]], stated, "Multiculturalism has seemed to imply, wrongly for me: let other cultures be allowed to express themselves but do not let the majority culture at all tell us its glories, its struggles, its joys, its pains."<ref>{{cite web|author=Post |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article592693.ece |title=Multiculturalism has betrayed the English, Archbishop says |publisher=Timesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref> The [[Bishop of Rochester]] [[Michael Nazir-Ali]] was also critical, calling for the Church to regain a prominent position in public life and blaming the "newfangled and insecurely founded doctrine of multiculturalism" for entrenching the segregation of communities. <ref>Michael Nazir-Ali [http://www.standpointmag.co.uk/node/85 "Breaking Faith With Britain"], ''Standpoint'', June 2008. </ref>

Whilst minority cultures are allowed to remain distinct, British culture and traditions are sometimes perceived as exclusive and adapted accordingly, often without the consent of the local population.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} For instance, [[Birmingham City Council]] was heavily criticised when it was alleged to have renamed Christmas as "Winterval" in 1998, although in truth it had done no such thing. <ref name="bbc1998">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/210672.stm |title=UK &#124; Winterval gets frosty reception |publisher=BBC News |date=1998-11-09 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}</ref><ref name="guar2006">

In August 2006, the community and local government secretary [[Ruth Kelly]] made a speech perceived as signalling the end of multiculturalism as official policy. <ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2006/aug/24/uksecurity.terrorism Ruth Kelly's speech on integration and cohesion], Guardian. </ref> In November 2006, Prime Minister Tony Blair stated that Britain has certain "essential values" and that these are a "duty". He did not reject multiculturalism outright, but he included British [[Tradition|heritage]] among the essential values:<ref>''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6219626.stm Conform to our society, says PM]'', Guardian, 8 December 2006. </ref> . 

:"When it comes to our essential values — belief in democracy, the rule of law, tolerance, equal treatment for all, respect for this country and its shared heritage — then that is where we come together, it is what we hold in common." . 

===New Labour and multiculturalism===. 
Renewed controversy on the subject came to the fore when Andrew Neather — a former adviser to [[Jack Straw]], [[Tony Blair]] and [[David Blunkett]] — claimed that Labour ministers had a hidden agenda in allowing mass immigration into Britain, to "change the face of Britain forever".This alleged conspiracy has become known by the sobriquet "Neathergate".  . 

According to Neather, who was present at closed meetings in 2000, a secret Government report called for mass immigration to change Britain's cultural make-up, and that “mass immigration was the way that the government was going to make the UK truly multicultural”. 
Neather went on to say that “the policy was intended — even if this wasn’t its main purpose — to rub the right’s nose in diversity and render their arguments out of date”. <ref>{{cite web|author=Post |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/minette_marrin//article6898174.ece |title=Labour’s secret scheme to build multicultural Britain |publisher=Timesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Simon Walters, Mail on Sunday Political Editor |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1222769/Dishonest-Blair-Straw-accused-secret-plan-multicultural-UK.html |title='Dishonest' Blair and Straw accused over secret plan for multicultural UK |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2009-10-25 |accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref>  . 

This was later affirmed after a request through the [[freedom of information act]] secured access to the full version of a 2000 government report on immigration that had been heavily edited on a previous release. <ref>{{cite web|last=Whitehead |first=Tom |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/7198329/Labours-secret-plan-to-lure-migrants.html |title='&#39;Labour's 'secret plan' to lure migrants: The Government has been accused of pursuing a secret policy of encouraging mass immigration for its own political ends'&#39;, The Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref> The Conservative party demanded an independent inquiry into the issue and alleged that the document showed that Labour had overseen a deliberate open-door ­policy on immigration to boost multi-culturalism for political ends.  . 

In February 2011 Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] stated that the "doctrine of state multiculturalism" (promoted by the previous Labour government) has failed and will be no longer be state policy. <ref>{{cite web|last=Kirkup |first=James |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/david-cameron/8305346/Muslims-must-embrace-our-British-values-David-Cameron-says.html |title='&#39;Muslims must embrace our British values, David Cameron says.'&#39; The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref> He stated that the UK needed a stronger [[national identity]] and signalled a tougher stance on groups promoting Islamist extremism. <ref>{{cite web|author=Laura Kuenssberg |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12371994 |title='&#39;State multiculturalism has failed, says David Cameron'&#39;, BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-02-05 |accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref> . 

==United States==. 
The Congress passed the [[Emergency Quota Act]] in 1921, followed by the [[Immigration Act of 1924]]. The Immigration Act of 1924 was aimed at further restricting the Southern and Eastern Europeans, especially Italians and Slavs, who had begun to enter the country in large numbers beginning in the 1890s. <ref>[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003265600_impghistory20.html Old fears over new faces], The Seattle Times, September 21, 2006</ref> Most of the European [[refugee]]s fleeing the Nazis and World War II were barred from coming to the United States. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usconstitution.com/immigrationactof1924.htm |title=The Immigration Act of 1924 |publisher=U S Constitution |date= |accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref> . 

In the 1980s and 1990s many criticisms were expressed, from both the left and right. Criticisms come from a wide variety of perspectives, but predominantly from the perspective of [[liberalism|liberal individualism]], from American [[conservatism|conservatives]] concerned about shared traditional [[Culture war|values]], and from a national unity perspective.  . 

The [[liberal feminism|liberal-feminist]] critique is related to the [[liberalism|liberal]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] critique, since it is concerned with what happens ''inside'' the cultural groups. In her 1999 essay, later expanded into an anthology, "Is Multiculturalism Bad for Women?" the feminist and political theorist [[Susan Okin]] argues that a concern for the preservation of cultural diversity should not overshadow the discriminatory nature of gender roles in many traditional minority cultures, that, at the very least, "culture" should not be used as an excuse for rolling back the [[women's rights]] movement. <ref name=Okin>[[Susan Okin]]. [http://www.bostonreview.net/BR22.5/okin.html "Is Multiculturalism Bad for Women?"], ''[[Boston Review]]'' 1999. </ref> . 

A prominent criticism in the US, later echoed in Europe, Canada and Australia, was that multiculturalism undermined national unity, hindered social integration and cultural assimilation, and led to the fragmentation of society into several ethnic factions ([[Balkanization]]). <ref>[http://www.statesman.com/opinion/content/editorial/stories/insight/07/08/0708diversity.html?cxtype=rss&cxsvc=7&cxcat=45 A diversity divide]{{Dead link|date=November 2008}}</ref>  . 

In 1991, [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]], a former advisor to the Kennedy and other US administrations and [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner, published a book critical of multiculturalism with the title ''[[The Disuniting of America]]: Reflections on a Multicultural Society.'' . 

In his 1991 work, ''Illiberal Education'',<ref>{{cite book |author=D'Souza, Dinesh |title=Illiberal Education: The Politics of Race and Sex on Campus |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |year=1991 |pages= |isbn=0-684-86384-7 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> [[Dinesh D'Souza]] <!---can someone include the full reference?---> argues that the entrenchment of multiculturalism in American universities undermined the universalist values that liberal education once attempted to foster. In particular, he was disturbed by the growth of ethnic studies programs (e.g., [[Africana studies|black studies]]).  . 

[[Samuel P. Huntington]], political scientist and author, known for his [[Clash of Civilizations]] theory, has described multiculturalism as "basically an anti-Western ideology." According to Huntington, multiculturalism has "attacked the identification of the United States with Western civilization, denied the existence of a common American culture, and promoted racial, ethnic, and other subnational cultural identities and groupings."<ref>[[Samuel P. Huntington|Huntington, Samuel P.]], ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order'', New York, Simon & Schuster, 1996 ISBN 0-684-84441-9</ref> . 

Criticism of multiculturalism in the US was not always synonymous with [[opposition to immigration]]. Some politicians did address both themes, notably [[Patrick Buchanan]], who in 1993 described multiculturalism as "an across-the-board assault on our Anglo-American heritage."{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Buchanan and other [[paleoconservatives]] argue that multiculturalism is the ideology of the modern [[managerial state]], an ongoing regime that remains in power, regardless of what political party holds a majority. It acts in the name of abstract goals, such as equality or positive rights, and uses its claim of moral superiority, power of taxation and wealth redistribution to keep itself in power.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} . 

Multiculturalism has also been attacked through satire, such as the following proposition by [[John Derbyshire]]. 
<blockquote>
The Diversity Theorem: Groups of people from anywhere in the world, mixed together in any numbers and proportions whatsoever, will eventually settle down as a harmonious society, appreciating—nay, celebrating!—their differences... which will of course soon disappear entirely. </blockquote>
This theorem is held to be false by Derbyshire and other paleoconservatives. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NDU2NDk4MzRjNGNiODc1ZTIxYzJmNzRmNjRmMTViZTI= |title=John Derbyshire on Islam on National Review Online |publisher=Article.nationalreview.com |date=2007-09-20 |accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref> . 

[[Lawrence Auster]], another conservative critic of multiculturalism, has argued that although multiculturalism is meant to promote the value of each culture, the reality is that its real tendency has been to undermine America's traditional majority culture. In Auster's view, multiculturalism has tended to "downgrade our national culture while raising the status and power of other cultures." . 

He writes: . 

<blockquote>The formal meaning of “diversity,” “cultural equity,” “gorgeous mosaic” and so on is a society in which many different cultures will live together in perfect equality and peace (i.e., a society that has never existed and never will exist); the real meaning of these slogans is that the power of the existing mainstream society to determine its own destiny shall be drastically reduced while the power of other groups, formerly marginal or external to that society, will be increased. In other words the U.S. must, in the name of diversity, abandon its particularity while the very groups making that demand shall hold on to theirs. <ref>Auster, L. (1990). ''[http://jtl.org/auster/PNS/PNS_Contents.html The Path to National Suicide]'', Charles Town, West Virginia: Old Line Press (ISBN 0-936247-12-6)</ref></blockquote> . 

According to Auster: . 

<blockquote>Since multiculturalism claims to stand for the sanctity and worth of each culture, the discovery that its real tendency is to dismantle the existing, European-based culture of the United States should have instantly discredited it. <ref>Lawrence Auster, "[http://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc1403/article_1227.shtml How the Multicultural Ideology Captured America]," The Social Contract, Spring 2004. </ref></blockquote> . 

Another critic of multiculturalism is the political theorist [[Brian Barry]]. In his 2002 book ''Culture and Equality: An Egalitarian Critique of Multiculturalism'',<ref>{{cite book |author=Barry, Brian M. |title=Culture and Equality: An Egalitarian Critique of Multiculturalism |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=0-674-01001-9 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> he argues that some forms of multiculturalism can divide people, although they need to unite in order to fight for social justice.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} . 

[[Kevin B. MacDonald]], a professor of psychology at California State University, Long Beach, has argued in his trilogy of books on Judaism that Jews have been prominent as main ideologues and promoters of multiculturalism in an attempt to end [[anti-semitism]]. <ref>MacDonald, Kevin B. (1998, 2002). ''The Culture of Critique''. Westport, CT: Praeger, 1998. Bloomington, IN: 1stbooks Library, 2002. ISBN 0-275-96113-3</ref> MacDonald considers multiculturalism to be dangerous to the West, concluding in his Jack London Literary Prize acceptance speech: 
<blockquote>
[Given] that some ethnic groups—especially ones with high levels of ethnocentrism and mobilization—will undoubtedly continue to function as groups far into the foreseeable future, unilateral renunciation of ethnic loyalties by some groups means only their surrender and defeat—the Darwinian dead end of extinction. The future, then, like the past, will inevitably be a Darwinian competition in which ethnicity plays a very large role. </blockquote>
<blockquote>
The alternative faced by Europeans throughout the [[Western world]] is to place themselves in a position of enormous vulnerability in which their destinies will be determined by other peoples, many of whom hold deep historically conditioned hatreds toward them. Europeans’ promotion of their own displacement is the ultimate foolishness—an historical mistake of catastrophic proportions. <ref>[http://theoccidentalquarterly.com/archives/vol4no4/km-model.html Can the Jewish Model Help the West Survive]</ref>
</blockquote> . 

Finally, multiculturalism and cultural relativism have been fiercely attacked by American social thinker [[Lloyd deMause]], founder of [[psychohistory]]. DeMause's central argument is that, in the past, the [[Infanticide#Infanticide throughout history and pre-history|astronomical infanticidal]] ratios among the tribes gives the lie to the claim that the diverse cultures are basically equal. DeMause wrote: "The best estimate I could make from the statistics was that in antiquity about half of all children born were killed by their caretakers, declining to about a third by later medieval times and to a very small percentage by the seventeenth century in Western Europe and America."<ref>{{cite journal | last = deMause| first = Lloyd| authorlink = | title = On Writing Childhood History   | journal =  [[The Journal of Psychohistory]]  | volume = (2) | issue = Fall| pages =  | series = 16| publisher = | location =  | year = 1988| url = http://www.psychohistory.com/childhood/writech1.htm}}</ref> . 

===Diversity and social trust=== . 

Harvard professor of political science [[Robert D. Putnam]] conducted a nearly decade long study how diversity affects social trust. <ref name="Putnam, Robert D. 2007">Putnam, Robert D., "E Pluribus Unum: Diversity and Community in the Twenty-first Century -- The 2006 Johan Skytte Prize," ''Scandinavian Political Studies'' 30 (2), June 2007. </ref>  He surveyed 26,200 people in 40 American communities, finding that when the data were adjusted for class, income and other factors, the more racially diverse a community is, the greater the loss of trust.  People in diverse communities "don’t trust the local mayor, they don’t trust the local paper, they don’t trust other people and they don’t trust institutions," writes Putnam. <ref>Sailer, Steve, [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2007/jan/15/00007/ "Fragmented Future,"] ''American Conservative'', Jan. 15, 2007. </ref> In the presence of such ethnic diversity, Putnam maintains that  . 

<blockquote>
[W]e hunker down. We act like turtles. The effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined. And it’s not just that we don’t trust people who are not like us. In diverse communities, we don’t trust people who do look like us. <ref name="Putnam, Robert D. 2007"/>
</blockquote> . 

Ethologist [[Frank Salter]] writes: . 

<blockquote>
Relatively homogeneous societies invest more in public goods, indicating a higher level of public altruism.  For example, the degree of ethnic homogeneity correlates with the government's share of gross domestic product as well as the average wealth of citizens.  Case studies of the United States... find that multi-ethnic societies are less charitable and less able to cooperate to develop public infrastructure.... A recent multi-city study of municipal spending on public goods in the United States found that ethnically or racially diverse cities spend a smaller portion of their budgets and less per capita on public services than do the more homogenous cities. <ref>Salter, Frank, ''On Genetic Interests'', pg.146. </ref>
</blockquote> . 

==Yugoslavia==. 
{{See also|Balkanization}} . 

Before World War II, major tensions arose from the first, [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|monarchist Yugoslavia]]'s multi-ethnic makeup and absolute political and demographic domination of the Serbs. The [[Yugoslav wars]] that took place between 1991 and 2001 were characterized by bitter [[ethnic conflict]]s between the peoples of the former [[Yugoslavia]], mostly between [[Serbs]] on the one side and [[Croats]], [[Bosnians]] or [[Albanians]] on the other; but also between Bosniaks and Croats in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] and Albanians in the [[Republic of Macedonia]].  . 

The conflict had its roots in various underlying political, economic and cultural problems, as well as long-standing [[ethnic]] and [[religion|religious]] tensions.  . 

==Multiculturalism and Islam==. 
{{Main|Multiculturalism and Islam}}
In an article in the ''[[Hudson Review]]'', [[Bruce Bawer]], writes about what he sees as a developing distaste toward the idea and policies of multiculturalism in Europe, especially, as stated earlier, in the [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Austria]] and [[Germany]]. The belief behind this backlash on multiculturalism is that it creates friction within society. <ref>"[http://www.hudsonreview.com/bawerWi06.pdf Crisis in Europe]"</ref> .
