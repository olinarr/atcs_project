The above statistics do not include the approximately 30,000 [[United States|U.S.]] military stationed in Japan nor illegal immigrants. Moreover, the statistics also do not take into account minority groups who are Japanese citizens such as the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] (an aboriginal people primarily living in Hokkaido), the [[Ryukyuans]] (who may or may not be considered ethnically [[Yamato people]]), and ethnic Koreans and Chinese who have adopted Japanese citizenship.  . 

==Japanese ethnic minorities==. 
The nine largest minority groups residing in Japan are the North and South [[Koreans in Japan|Korean]]s, [[Chinese people in Japan|Chinese]], [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] (most Brazilians in Japan have [[Japanese Brazilian|some Japanese ancestors]]), [[Filipinos in Japan|Filipino]], [[Taiwanese in Japan|Taiwanese]], the [[Ainu people|Ainu]], and the [[Ryukyuans|Ryukyuan]]. There are also a number of smaller ethnic communities in Japan with a much shorter history.  . 

According to the [[United Nations]]' 2008 Diène report, communities most affected by racism and xenophobia in Japan include:<ref>Diène, .

===Korean people===. 
{{Main|Koreans in Japan}}
<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Kenkanryu cover.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Manga Kenkanryu (マンガ 嫌韓流, Manga Kenkanryū?), translated as '''Manga—The Anti-Korean Wave''']] --> . 

''Zainichi'' (resident in Japan) [[Korea]]ns are permanent residents of Japan, but hold North or South Korean citizenship. Most Zainichi came to Japan during the colonial period. <ref>[[John Lie]] ''Zainichi (Koreans in Japan)''))(Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008)</ref> . 

A large proportion of this immigration is said to be the result of Korean landowners and workers losing their land and livelihood due to Japanese land and production confiscation initiatives and migrating to Japan for work.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} According to the calculation of [[R. J. Rummel]], a total of 5.4 million Koreans were also [[Conscription|conscripted]] into forced labor, and shipped throughout the [[Japanese empire|Japanese Empire]]. Of these, 210,000 to 870,000 Koreans died during forced labor in places such as [[Manchuria]] and [[Sakhalin]]. <ref>{{cite book | first=R. J. | last=Rummel | coauthors= | title=Statistics of Democide: Genocide and Mass Murder Since 1990 | publisher=Lit Verlag | location= | year=1999 | editor= | isbn=3-8258-4010-7}}

Many Korean refugees also came to the country during the [[Jeju massacre]] in the [[First Republic of South Korea]]. Though most migrants returned to Korea, [[Supreme Commander Allied Powers|GHQ]] estimates in 1946 indicated that 650,000 Koreans remained in Japan.  . 

After World War II, the Korean community in Japan was split between allegiance to [[South Korea]] ([[Mindan]]) and [[North Korea]] ([[Chongryon]]). South Koreans in Japan are called ''Zainichi Kankokujin'' (在日韓国人, 재일한국인), while North Koreans are called ''Zainichi Chosenjin'' (在日朝鮮人, 재일조선인).  . 

Zainichi who identify themselves with Chongryon are also an important money source of North Korea. <ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink = Anna Fifield in Seoul, Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo, Mark Turner in New York and agencies | coauthors = | title = N.

Japanese law does not allow dual citizenship, and until the 1980s required adoption of a Japanese name for citizenship. <ref>[http://www.ccis-ucsd.org/PUBLICATIONS/wrkg80.pdf Non citizens, Voice, and Identity: the Politics of Citizenship in Japan’s Korean Community] accessed April 13, 2011</ref> Partially for this reason, many Zainichi did not obtain Japanese citizenship as they saw the process to be humiliating.  . 

Although more Zainichi are becoming Japanese citizens, issues of identity remain complicated. Even those who do not choose to become Japanese citizens often use Japanese names to avoid discrimination and live their lives as if they were Japanese. This is in contrast with the Chinese living in Japan, who generally use their Chinese names and openly form Chinatown communities.  . 

An increase in tensions between Japan and North Korea in the late 1990s led to a surge of attacks against Chongryon, the pro-North residents organisation, including a pattern of assaults against Korean schoolgirls in Japan. <ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/terror-attacks-on-koreans-rise-in-japan-1184794.html Terror attacks on Koreans rise in Japan] accessed at November 13, 2011</ref> For a long time, Chongryon enjoyed unofficial immunity from searches and investigations, although it has long been suspected of a variety of criminal acts on behalf of North Korea, such as illegal transfer of funds to North Korea and espionage.  . 

The Japanese authorities have recently started to crack down on Chongryon with investigations and arrests. These moves are often criticized by Chongryon as acts of political suppression. <ref>[http://www1.korea-np.co.jp/pk/228th_issue/2006041508.htm FM Spokesman Urges Japan to Stop Suppression of Chongryon], [[Choson Sinbo]], 5/13/06. </ref> . 

When [[Tokyo]] Governor [[Shintaro Ishihara]] referred to Chinese and Koreans as 三国人 ''[[sangokujin]]'' in context of foreigners being a potential source of unrest in the aftermath of an earthquake, the foreign community complained.  . 

Historically, the word has often been used pejoratively and Ishihara's statement brought images of the massacre of Koreans by civilians and police alike after the [[1923 Great Kanto earthquake]] to mind. Therefore, the use of the term in context of potential rioting by foreigners is considered by many as provocative, if not explicitly racist.  . 

===Chinese people===. 
{{Main|Chinese people in Japan}}
Mainland Chinese are the largest minority in Japan (according to the 2008 statistics as shown above). Mainland Chinese in particular have been targets of anti-immigrant sentiment along with government, police and media portrayal of them as being likely to commit crime. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
Indeed, an investigator from the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] ([[UNCHR]]) said, racism against [[Koreans]] and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] is deeply rooted in Japan because of history and culture. <ref>[http://replay.web.archive.org/20090204153432/http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2005-07/2005-07-11-voa9.cfm Voice of America news: UN Independent Investigator Raps Japan for Discrimination]</ref> . 

There are a number of Taiwanese people that reside in Japan due to close (yet unofficial) ties between Taiwan and Japan.  Taiwan was a colony of Japan from 1895 to 1945 and Taiwanese during this time were considered Japanese citizens.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} . 

===Ainu===. 
{{Main|Ainu people}}
The [[Ainu people|Ainu]] are an indigenous group mainly living in [[Hokkaidō]]. The Tokugawa Shogunate tried to develop Hokkaido to counter [[Russia]]'s growing influence in the [[Far East]], but mostly left the place for the native Ainu.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Then the Meiji government started development programs, increasingly aimed at assimilating the Ainu,{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} outlawing [[Ainu language]] and restricting them to farming on government-provided plots.  . 

Many of the Ainu were also used in slave-like conditions by the Japanese fishing industry. As the Japanese government encouraged immigration of ethnic Japanese to populate Hokkaido, the Ainu became increasingly marginalised in their own land.  . 

At present, the official Japanese government estimate of the population is '''25,000''', though this number has been disputed with unofficial estimates of upwards of 200,000. <ref name="Poisson, B 2002, p.5">Poisson, B. 2002, ''The Ainu of Japan'', Lerner Publications, Minneapolis, p.5. </ref>.  Of these, fewer than 20,000 Ainu are considered racially distinct.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}  Most, if not all, of the Ainu in Japan are of mixed ancestry. Many customs and traditions of the Ainu have been lost, abandoned or annihilated by way of assimilation, and the Ainu language is no longer in common use.  . 

Only in the decades after World War II have the Ainu started to become aware of international aboriginal rights movements. Largely due to the efforts of [[Shigeru Kayano]], the first Ainu member of the [[Diet of Japan]], some schools in Hokkaido have been established to preserve and revive the Ainu culture.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} . 

===Ryukyuan people===. 
{{Main|Ryukyuan people|Ryūkyū independence movement}}
The [[Ryukyuans|Ryukyuan people]] lived in an independent [[Ryūkyū Kingdom|kingdom]] until it came under the control of Japan's [[Satsuma Domain]] in 1609. The kingdom, however, retained a degree of autonomy until 1879 when the islands were officially annexed by Japan as [[Okinawa Prefecture]].  . 

The [[Okinawan language]], the most widely spoken [[Ryukyuan language]], is related to Japanese, the two being in the [[Japonic languages]]. There are still some children learning Ryukyuan languages natively, but this is rare especially on mainland Okinawa. The language still is used in traditional cultural activities, such as folk music, or folk dance.  . 

Culturally, [[Okinawa]] is also close to southern [[China]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Southeast Asia]] reflecting its long history of trade with these regions. However, because of the standard use of Japanese in schools, television, and all print media in Okinawa, these cultural differences are often glossed over in Japanese society. Consequently, many Japanese consider Okinawans to be Japanese, sometimes ignoring their distinct cultural and historical heritage in insensitive ways.  . 

===Burakumin===. 
The [[Burakumin|Buraku]] people are a stigmatized group who have faced bigotry and persecution in Japan for centuries. They have been characterized as "the invisible race", because while they are still considered socially inferior by much of Japanese society, they are not typically held to be racially different. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,910511,00.html | work=Time | title=JAPAN: The Invisible Race | date=1973-01-08 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Condry  | first = Ian  | title = Hip Hop Japan  | publisher = Duke University Press  | location = California  | year = 2007  | pages = 37}}</ref> . 

Presently, there is a steep income difference between "buraku" and "non-buraku" people ranging at about one million yen, or $10,000 income per year less than the Japanese mainstream. Lately however, there has been some awareness of the mistreatment of the Buraku and some measures have been taken to provide these people with better education and housing situations.  . 

The history of the prejudice of these people comes from ancient times when the Burakumin were labeled "unclean" because of their occupations as leather cleaners, butchers, or executioners. There are approximately 2-3 million burakumin in the country.  . 

Today, many influential Japanese figures such as politicians, actors, artists, and businessmen, are compelled to conceal their true Buraku heritage for fear of losing their positions because of such heavy prejudice. <ref>Wood, Joe. The Yellow Negro. Stable URL:http://www.jstor.org/view/00411191/dm994485/99p0110e/0</ref> The Burakumin are commonly compared to the [[Dalit|untouchable]] caste present in the [[Indian caste system]] and the [[cagots]] of Europe, because of the similar lower class positioning in society as well as the discrimination from the greater population.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} . 

===Other groups===. 
{{Main|Americans in Japan|Bangladeshis in Japan|Brazilians in Japan|Filipinos in Japan|Indians in Japan|Indonesians in Japan|Iranians in Japan}}
{{Main|Pakistanis in Japan|Peruvians in Japan|Mongolians in Japan|Russians in Japan|Turks in Japan|Vietnamese people in Japan|History of the Jews in Japan}} . 

Other notable minorities in Japan include [[Brazilians in Japan|Brazilians]] and [[Filipinos in Japan|Filipinos]].  . 

Western foreigners in Japan, particularly those from [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], are often called 外国人 ''Gaikokujin'' or 外人 ''[[Gaijin]]''.  The first large influx of such foreigners occurred in the 1980s, when the Japanese government adopted a policy to give scholarships to large numbers of foreign students to study at Japanese universities.  . 

In addition, as the Japanese economy grew quickly in the 1980s, a sizable number of Westerners began coming to Japan. Many found jobs as [[eikaiwa|English conversation]] teachers, but others were employed in various professional fields such as finance and business. Although some have become permanent residents or even [[naturalized citizen]]s, they are generally perceived as short-term visitors and treated as outside of Japanese society.  . 

During the 1980s and 1990s, the [[Keidanren]] business lobbying organization advocated a policy of allowing [[South America]]ns of Japanese ancestry (mainly [[Japanese Brazilian|Brazilians]] and [[Japanese Peruvians|Peruvians]]) to work in Japan, as Japan's industries faced a major labor shortage. Although this policy has been decelerated in recent years, many of these individuals continue to live in Japan, some in ethnic enclaves near their workplaces.  . 

Many people from Southeast Asia (particularly [[Vietnam]] and the [[Philippines]]) and [[Southwest Asia]] (and [[Iran]]) also entered Japan during this time, making foreigners as a group a more visible minority in Japan. Those foreigners are called 来日 ''Rainichi'' ("coming to Japan") in contrast to 在日 ''Zainichi'' ("in Japan").  . 

The main concerns of the latter groups are often related to their legal status, a public perception of criminal activity, and general discrimination associated with being non-Japanese.  . 

[[Sakhalin]], which was once part of Japan as [[Karafuto Prefecture]], had indigenous populations of [[Nivkh people|Nivkhs]] and Uilta ([[Orok people|Orok]]). Like the [[Sakhalin Koreans|Karafuto Koreans]] but unlike the Ainu, they were thus not included in the [[Evacuation of Karafuto and Kuriles|evacuation of Japanese nationals]] after the Soviet invasion in 1945. Some Nivkhs and Uilta who served in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] were [[Japanese prisoners of war in the Soviet Union|held in Soviet work camps]]; after court cases in the late 1950s and 1960s, they were recognised as Japanese nationals and thus permitted to migrate to Japan. Most settled around [[Abashiri, Hokkaidō]]. <ref>{{harvnb|Weiner|2004|pp=274–275}}</ref> The Uilta Kyokai<ref>[http://www.d2.dion.ne.jp/~bunkt/ Uilta Kyokai of Japan]</ref> was founded to fight for Uilta rights and the preservation of Uilta traditions in 1975 by [[Dahinien Gendānu]].  . 

There are a few [[:jp:欧米系島民|Creole people]] in [[Bonin Islands]]. Their ethnic background is various such as US, UK, France, Germany, Denmark, Micronesia, and Portugal. <ref>[http://nihongo.human.metro-u.ac.jp/~long/bonins/default.html The Bonin (Ogasawara) Islands Language and Culture Site,Daniel Long]</ref> . 

==Ethnic issues==. 
===Government policy===. 
[[File:Transition of Foreigners in Japan.gif|left|thumb|400px|Transition of Numbers of Registered Foreigners in Japan from 5 Major Countries, based on ''Immigration Control 2007'', by the Immigration Bureau, [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)]], 2007-9-21.]]
Because of the low importance placed on assimilating minorities in Japan, laws regarding ethnic matters receive low priority in the legislative process. <ref name="japantoday.com">http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/japan-disputes-racism-allegations-at-un-panel#show_all_comments</ref> Still, in 1997, "Ainu cultural revival" legislation was passed which replaced the previous "Hokkaido Former Aboriginal Protection" legislation that had devastating effects on the Ainu in the past.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} . 

Article 14 of the [[Constitution of Japan]] states that all ''people'' (English version) or ''citizens'' (revised Japanese version) are equal under the law, and they cannot be discriminated against politically, economically, or socially on the basis of race, belief, sex, or social or other background.  . 

However, Japan does not have [[civil rights]] legislation which enforces or penalizes discriminatory activities committed by citizens, businesses, or non-governmental organizations.  . 

Attempts have been made in the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]] to enact human rights legislation. In 2002, a draft was submitted to the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]], but did not reach a vote. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0XPQ/is_2005_May_16/ai_n13829869 | work=Japan Policy & Politics | title=LDP forgoes immediate Diet submission of human rights bill | year=2005}}</ref> Had the law passed, it would have set up a Human Rights Commission to investigate, [[name and shame]], or financially penalize discriminatory practices as well as hate speech committed by private citizens or establishments.  . 

Another issue which has been publicly debated but has not received much legislative attention is whether to allow permanent residents to vote in local legislatures.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} ''Zainichi'' organizations affiliated with North Korea are against this initiative, while ''Zainichi'' organizations affiliated with South Korea support it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} . 

Finally, there is debate about altering requirements for work permits to foreigners. Currently, the Japanese government does not issue work permits unless it can be demonstrated that the person has certain skills which cannot be provided by locals.  . 

===Access to housing and other services===. 
A handful of apartments, motels, night clubs, brothels, sex parlours and public baths in Japan have put up signs stating that foreigners are not allowed, or that they must be accompanied by a Japanese person to enter<ref>[http://www.debito.org/roguesgallery.html "THE ROGUES' GALLERY" PHOTOS OF PLACES IN JAPAN WHICH EXCLUDE OR RESTRICT NON-JAPANESE CUSTOMERS] on Debito's official website accessed at January 16, 2008. </ref>  However, these signs are very rare and many Japanese claim that the prohibitions are due to perceived social incompatibility—for example, foreigners may not understand proper bathhouse etiquette—and not racism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} . 

In housing there is also discrimination based on ethnicity. In a 2006 survey by the Information Center for Foreigners in Japan, 94% of foreign residents reported being refused by at least one real estate agent. <ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20071110f1.html Foreigners still dogged by housing barriers] on The Japan Times accessed at January 16, 2008</ref> . 

In fact, there were a substantial number of lawsuits regarding discrimination against foreigners. For example, in 2005, a Korean woman who attempted to rent a room was refused because she was not a Japanese citizen. She filed a discrimination lawsuit, and she won in Japanese court. <ref>[http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200710/200710050017.html The Chosun Ilbo article<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . 

“Discrimination toward foreign nationals in their searches for homes continues to be one of the biggest problems”, said the head of the Ethnic Media Press Centre. Organizers of the service said they hope to eradicate the racism that prevents foreigners, particularly Non-Westerners, from renting apartments since there are currently no laws in Japan that ban discrimination. <ref>[http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/e06a5300f90fa0238025668700518ca4/a80788bbc13a7676c1256be90035b864/$FILE/G0213907.pdf a UNHCHR report PREVENTION OF DISCRIMINATION The rights of non-citizens]</ref> . 

===Higher learning===. 
Although foreign professors teach throughout the Japanese higher education system, [http://ns.eps.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/jp/member/index.php?_urid=1386&_lang=ja Robert J. Geller] of [[University of Tokyo]] reported, in 1992, that it was extremely rare for them to be given [[tenure]]. <ref>Robert J. Geller, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/258/5087/1421.pdf Letters: Tenure for Foreigners in Japan], ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', '''258''', 5087, 1421 (1992). </ref> . 

===Non-Japanese citizens and crimes===. 
Similar to other countries, many foreigners come to Japan to work, sometimes entering the country illegally, and overstaying the terms of their visas. Their employment tends to be concentrated in areas where most Japanese are not able to or no longer wish to work.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} . 

According to National Police Authority record in 2002, however, 16,212 foreigners were caught committing 34,746 crimes, over half of which turned out to be visa violations (residing/working in Japan without a valid visa).{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The statistics show that 12,667 cases (36.5%) and 6,487 individuals (40.0%) were Chinese, 5,272 cases (15.72%) and 1,186 individuals (7.3%) were Brazilian, and 2,815 cases (8.1%) and 1,738 individuals (10.7%) were Korean. The total number of crimes committed in the same year by Japanese was 546,934 cases.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} . 

Within these statistics, Japanese committed 6,925 violent crimes, of which 2,531 were arson or rape, while foreigners committed 323 violent crimes, but only 42 cases are classified as arson or rape.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Foreigners were more likely to commit crimes in groups: About 61.5% of crimes committed by foreigners had one or more accomplice, while only 18.6% of crimes committed by Japanese were in groups.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} . 

The former head of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government's Emergency Public Safety Task Force, Hiroshi Kubo, published a book called {{Nihongo|''Chian wa Hontouni Akkashiteirunoka''|治安はほんとうに悪化しているのか}} (in English: ''Is Public Safety Really Deteriorating?'', ISBN 978-4861620256) disputing foreign crime statistics, suggesting that such statistics were being manipulated by politicians for political gain. He suggested, for example, that including visa violations in crime statistics is misleading. He also said that the crime rate in Tokyo is based on reported rather than actual crimes. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.debito.org/?p=17|title=Ex-deputy of Tokyo Gov.

===Comment by U.N. special rapporteur on racism and xenophobia===. 
In [[2005]], a [[United Nations]] special rapporteur on racism and xenophobia expressed concerns about "deep and profound" racism in Japan and insufficient government recognition of the problem. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unic.or.jp/new/pr05-057-E.htm |title=Press Conference by Mr Doudou Diène, Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights |accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref><ref name="BBC">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4671687.stm "Japan racism 'deep and profound".] [[BBC News]] (2005-07-11).

[[Doudou Diène]] ([[United Nations Special Rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] of the [[UN Commission on Human Rights]]) concluded after an investigation and nine-day tour of [[Japan]] that racial discrimination and [[xenophobia]] in Japan primarily affects three groups: national minorities, descendants of former [[Japanese colonies]] and foreigners from other Asian countries. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imadr.org/geneva/2006/G0610396.pdf |format=PDF|title='Overcoming "Marginalization" and "Invisibility"', International Movement against all forms of Discrimination and Racism |accessdate=2007-01-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061214115324/http://imadr.org/geneva/2006/G0610396.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-12-14}}</ref> In spite of the widespread belief that Japan is ethnically homogeneous, it is probably more accurate to describe it as a [[multiethnic society]]. <ref>[[John Lie]] "Multiethnic Japan" (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2001)</ref> . 

''[[Sankei Shimbun]]'', a Japanese national newspaper, while expressing a support for combating discrimination, expressed doubt on the impartiality of the report, pointing out that Doudou Diène never visited Japan before and his short tour was arranged by a Japanese NGO, IMADR (International Movement Against All Forms of Discrimination). The chairman of the organization is Professor Kinhide Mushakoji (武者小路公秀), who is a board member (and the former director of the board) of the International Institute of the [[Juche]] Idea (主体思想国際研究所), an organization whose stated purpose is to propagate the official ideology of North Korea. <ref>"報告の陰に連携 (産経新聞「妙」 2005/11/13) 国連人権委員会のディエヌ特別報告者（セネガル）が七日、国連総会第三委員会（人権）で、日本に存在する差別を指摘、それを受けて中国、韓国、北朝鮮の代表が日本を批判したという記事が目に留まった。「差別」の存在は厳粛に受け止め、解消に向けて努力するべきだが、あまりに見事な連携ではないか。「仕組まれた」という思いが拭いきれない。近年、日本に「悪意」をいだくグループが「人権」を武器に、国連を利用し日本に”言いがかり”をつけることがよくあるが、今回もそうではなかったか。そもそもディエヌ氏とはどういった経歴の持ち主なのか。そして、日本のどこをどれほどの期間調査したのか。また、彼をアテンドしたのはどういった団体だったのか。疑問は次々とわいてきた。国連広報センターに問い合わせてみた。明らかになった事実を記す。ディエヌ氏は１９９３年から２００２年にかけて国連科学文化機関（ユネスコ）の文化間・宗教間対話部長を務め、０２年に国連人権委員会により現代的形態の人種主義、人種差別、排外主義および関連する不寛容に関する特別報告者に任命された。今年の七月三日から十二日まで日本を訪れ、大阪、京都、北海道で被差別部落、在日韓国人・朝鮮人、アイヌ民族などのグループと面接調査した。訪問は初めてだった。　ディエヌ氏の調査をアレンジしたのは、反差別国際運動というNGO。この団体の理事長は武者小路公秀氏。ピースおおさか（大阪市）の会長であり、金正日の思想を普及しようとするチュチェ思想国際研究所と関係の深い人物である。（桑原聡）"</ref> . 

In 2010, according to the UN [[Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]], Japan's record on racism has improved, but there is still room for progress. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100226a4.html|title=Japan faces U.N. racism criticism|date=February 26, 2010|publisher=The Japan Times}}</ref> The committee was critical of the lack of anti-discrimination legislation in the country and the treatment of Japanese minorities and its large Korean and Chinese communities. <ref name="japantoday.com"/> "There seems to have been little progress since 2001," when the last review was held, committee member Regis de Gouttes said. "There is no new legislation, even though in 2001 the committee said prohibiting hate speech is compatible with freedom of expression." Many members of the committee, however, praised the Japanese government's recent recognition of the Ainu as an indigenous people.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} .
