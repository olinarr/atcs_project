==Background==. 
The convention is a legally-binding international agreement that ensures artists, cultural professionals, practitioners and citizens worldwide can create, produce, disseminate and enjoy a broad range of cultural goods, services and activities, including their own. <ref>[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/cultural-diversity/2005-convention/the-convention/what-is-the-convention/ UNESCO 2005 Convention]</ref> It was adopted in response to  "growing pressure exerted on countries to waive their right to enforce cultural policies and to put all aspects of the cultural sector on the table when negociating international trade agreements."<ref>[http://www.cdc-ccd.org/IMG/pdf/CDC_LowRez_EN.pdf Coalition for Cultural Diversity]</ref> "The international community signalled the urgency to implement an international law that would recognize:
*The distinctive nature of cultural goods, services and activities as vehicles of identity, values and meaning;
*That while cultural goods, services and activities have important economic value, they are not mere commodities or consumer goods that can only be regarded as objects of trade."<ref>[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/cultural-diversity/2005-convention/the-convention/what-is-the-convention/ UNESCO 2005 Convention]</ref> .
