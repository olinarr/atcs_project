'''Ethnic cleansing''' is a purposeful policy designed by one ethnic or religious group to remove by violent and terror-inspiring means the civilian population of another ethnic or
religious group from certain geographic areas. <ref>Report of the Commission of Experts Established Pursuant to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 780]] (1992), May 27, 1994 ([http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/1994/674 S/1994/674]), English page=33, Paragraph 130</ref> . 

An earlier draft by the Commission of Experts described ethnic cleansing as "the planned deliberate removal from a specific territory, persons of a particular [[ethnic group]], by force or intimidation, in order to render that area ethnically homogenous." which it based on "the many reports describing the policy and practices conducted in the former [[Yugoslavia]], 'ethnic cleansing' has been carried out by means of murder, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, extra-judicial executions, rape and sexual assaults, confinement of civilian population in ghetto areas, forcible removal, displacement and deportation of civilian population, deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas, and wanton destruction of property. Those practices constitute crimes against humanity and can be assimilated to specific war crimes. Furthermore, such acts could also fall within the meaning of the Genocide Convention". <ref>Report of the Commission of Experts Established Pursuant to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 780]] (1992), May 27, 1994 ([http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/1994/674 S/1994/674]), English page=33, Paragraph 129</ref> . 

Ethnic cleansing is not to be confused with [[genocide]]. These terms are not synonymous, yet the academic discourse considers both as existing in a spectrum of assaults on nations or religio-ethnic groups. Ethnic cleansing is similar to forced deportation or 'population transfer' whereas genocide is the "intentional murder of part or all of a particular ethnic, religious, or national group."<ref name=Schabas>[Schabas W.

==Definitions==. 
The official United Nations definition of ethnic cleansing is "rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or [[intimidation]] to remove from a given area persons of another ethnic or religious group." . 

The term ethnic cleansing has been defined as a spectrum, or continuum by some historians. In the words of [[Andrew Bell-Fialkoff]]:<blockquote>[E]thnic cleansing [...] defies easy definition. At one end it is virtually indistinguishable from forced emigration and population exchange while at the other it merges with [[deportation]] and [[genocide]]. At the most general level, however, ethnic cleansing can be understood as the expulsion of a population from a given territory''. <ref>Andrew  Bell-Fialkoff, "[http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5199/andrew-bell-fialkoff/a-brief-history-of-ethnic-cleansing.html A Brief History of Ethnic Cleansing]", Foreign Affairs 72 (3): 110, Summer 1993. Retrieved May 20, 2006. </ref></blockquote> . 

[[Terry Martin (publisher)|Terry Martin]] has defined ethnic cleansing as "the forcible removal of an ethnically defined population from a given territory" and as "occupying the central part of a continuum between genocide on one end and nonviolent pressured ethnic emigration on the other end."<ref name="martin">Martin, Terry (1998). [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0022-2801%28199812%2970%3A4%3C813%3ATOOSEC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-A The Origins of Soviet Ethnic Cleansing]. ''[[The Journal of Modern History]]'' 70 (4), 813–861. pg. 822</ref> . 

In reviewing the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) [[Bosnian Genocide Case]] in the judgement of [[Jorgic v. Germany]] on July 12, 2007 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] quoted from the ICJ ruling on the ''Bosnian Genocide Case'' to draw a distinction between ''ethnic cleansing'' and ''genocide''. <blockquote>The term 'ethnic cleansing' has frequently been employed to refer to the events in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] which are the subject of this case ... [[UN General Assembly|General Assembly]] resolution 47/121 referred in its Preamble to 'the abhorrent policy of 'ethnic cleansing', which is a form of genocide', as being carried on in Bosnia and Herzegovina. ... It [''i.e. ethnic cleansing''] can only be a form of genocide within the meaning of the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide|[Genocide] Convention]], if it corresponds to or falls within one of the categories of acts prohibited by Article II of the Convention. Neither the intent, as a matter of policy, to render an area “ethnically homogeneous”, nor the operations that may be carried out to implement such policy, can as such be designated as genocide: the intent that characterizes genocide is “to destroy, in whole or in part” a particular group, and deportation or displacement of the members of a group, even if effected by force, is not necessarily equivalent to destruction of that group, nor is such destruction an automatic consequence of the displacement. This is not to say that acts described as 'ethnic cleansing' may never constitute genocide, if they are such as to be characterized as, for example, 'deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part', contrary to Article II, paragraph (c), of the Convention, provided such action is carried out with the necessary specific intent (''[[dolus specialis]]''), that is to say with a view to the destruction of the group, as distinct from its removal from the region. As the [[ICTY]] has observed, while 'there are obvious similarities between a genocidal policy and the policy commonly known as 'ethnic cleansing' ' (''Krstić,'' IT-98-33-T, Trial Chamber Judgment, August 2, 2001, para. 562), yet '[a] clear distinction must be drawn between physical destruction and mere dissolution of a group. The expulsion of a group or part of a group does not in itself suffice for genocide. |ECHR quoting the ICJ. <ref>[[European Court of Human Rights|ECHR]] [http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=54&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=&sessionid=1448788&skin=hudoc-en Jorgic v. Germany] §45 citing Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro (“Case concerning the application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide”) the International Court of Justice (ICJ) found under the heading of “intent and 'ethnic cleansing'” § 190</ref></blockquote> . 

==Origins of the term==. 
The practice is much older than the term, known throughout history. The term itself appears to have been popularised by the international media approximately early in 1992, following the discovery of Bosnian-Serb Concentration camps established in April 1992, and the subsequent assault on [[Sarajevo]]. <ref>[http://www.historyplace.com/worldhistory/genocide/bosni.atm historyplace:Etnnic cleansing]</ref> . 

During the 1990s, the term was used extensively by the media in the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] in relation to the wars in [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia]]. The conflicting parties used widespread and systematic acts of persecution (murder, violence, detention, intimidation) against opposing populations, creating a such coercive and frightening atmosphere that the targeted population had no option but to flee or be forcibly deported. These acts were carried out from (at least) August 1991. [[Croats]] and [[Bosniak]]s were expelled by [[Serb]]s, [[Serb]]s and [[Bosniak]]s by Croats, and Bosniaks expelled the perceived rival populations from their domains. This period of ethnic cleansing culminated in 1995, when the long-established population of [[Krajina]] was completely expunged. Serbs who remained, mostly elderly and helpless, were murdered by [[Croats|Croatian]] paramilitaries. <ref name="Reuters-Krajina">[http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKL1187232120080311 FACTBOX – Brief history of Croatia's rebel Serb Krajina region | World | Reuters]</ref> . 

As early as 1914, a [[Carnegie Endowment]] report on the [[Balkan Wars]] points out that village-burning and ethnic cleansing had traditionally accompanied [[Balkan]] wars, regardless of the ethnic group in power. However, the term "cleanse" was probably used first by [[Vuk Karadžić]], to describe what happened to the [[Turkish people|Turks]] in Belgrade when the city was captured by the [[Karadjordje]]'s forces in 1806. <ref>{{cite book |author=Judah, Tim |title=The Serbs: History, Myth and the Destruction of Yugoslavia |year=1997 |location=New Haven and London |publisher=Yale University Press|page=75 |isbn=0-300-08507-9}}</ref> [[Konstantin Nenadović]] wrote, in his biography of the famous Serbian leader published in 1883, that after the fighting "the [[Serbs]], in their bitterness (after 500 years of Turkish occupation), slit the throats of the Turks everywhere they found them, sparing neither the wounded, nor the woman, nor the Turkish children". <ref>{{cite book |author=Mirko Grmek, Marc Gjidara, Neven Simac|title=Le Nettoyage ethnique: Documents historiques sur une idéologie serbe |year=1993 |location=Paris |language=French|page=24}}</ref>
[[File:Serbs expelled.jpg|thumb|Serbs are expelled by [[Ustaše]] in 1941.]]
During World War II, [[Mile Budak]] laid down the Croatian plan to purge Croatia of Serbs: by killing one third, expelling one third and assimilating the rest.  . 

On May 16, 1941, a commander in the Croatian extremist [[Ustase|Ustaše]] faction, [[Viktor Gutic|Viktor Gutić]], said:
<blockquote>
"Every Croat who today solicits for our enemies not only is not a good Croat, but also an opponent and disrupter of the prearranged, well-calculated plan for cleansing ''[čišćenje]'' our [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] of unwanted elements [...]."<ref>[http://www.pavelicpapers.com/documents/ndhnews/ndhn0004.html Pavelicpapers.com]</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=June 2008}}
</blockquote> . 

Only a month later (June 30, 1941), [[Stevan Moljević]] (a lawyer from [[Banja Luka]] who was also an ideologue of the [[Chetnik]]s), published a booklet with the title "On Our State and Its Borders". Moljević asserted:
<blockquote>
"One must take advantage of the war conditions and at a suitable moment seize the territory marked on the map, cleanse ''[očistiti]'' it before anybody notices and with strong battalions occupy the key places (...) and the territory surrounding these cities, freed of non-[[Serbs|Serb]] elements. The guilty must be promptly punished and the others deported – the [[Croats]] to (significantly amputated) Croatia, the Muslims to [[Turkey]] or perhaps [[Albania]] – while the vacated territory is settled with Serb refugees now located in Serbia."<ref>[http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=3025&reportid=169 The Moljevic Memorandum]</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=May 2009}}
</blockquote> . 

In fact, the Ustaše carried out widespread persecution and massacre of the [[Serbs of Croatia|Serbs in Croatia]] during World War II, and on several occasions used the term "cleansing" to describe these acts. <ref>[http://www.pavelicpapers.com/documents/ndh/ndh002.html Pavelicpapers.com]</ref> . 

However, the concept of ethnic cleansing was not restricted to Yugoslavia during this period. The Russian term "cleansing of borders" (''ochistka granits'' – очистка границ), was used in [[Soviet Union]] documents of the early 1930s to describe the forced resettlement of [[Polish people]] from the 22&nbsp;km [[Border Security Zone of Russia|border zone]] in the [[Byelorussian SSR]] and [[Ukrainian SSR]]. This process was repeated on an even larger and wider scale in 1939–1941, involving many other ethnicities with allegedly external loyalties: see [[Involuntary settlements in the Soviet Union]] and [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union]]. <ref name="martin"/> . 

Most notoriously, the [[Nazism|Nazi]] administration in Germany under [[Adolf Hitler]] applied a similar term to their systematic replacement of the Jewish people. When an area under Nazi control had its entire Jewish population removed, by driving the population out, by deportation to [[Concentration Camp]]s and/or murder, that area was declared ''[[judenrein]]'' (lit. "Jew Clean"): "cleansed of Jews" (cf. [[racial hygiene]]).  . 

==Ethnic cleansing as a military, political and economic tactic==. 
{{Section OR|date=June 2009}}
[[Image:Abkhazia genocidememorial2005.jpg|200px|thumb|The 12th anniversary of ethnic cleansing in [[Abkhazia]], which was held in [[Tbilisi]] in 2005.]] . 

The purpose of ethnic cleansing is to remove competitors. The party implementing this policy sees a risk (or a useful scapegoat) in a particular ethnic group, and uses propaganda about that group to stir up [[Fear, uncertainty and doubt|FUD]] (fear, uncertainty and doubt) in the general population. The targeted ethnic group is marginalized and demonized. It can also be conveniently blamed for the economic, moral and political woes of that region.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010|reason=Without an expert opinion this paragraph is OR. In the case of civil war based on ethnicity there is no need to use propaganda.}}{{Or|date=June 2010}} . 

Physically removing the targeted ethnic community provides a very clear, visual reminder of the power of the current government. It also provides a safety-valve for violence stirred up by the FUD. The government in power benefits significantly from seizing the assets of the dispossessed ethnic group.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010|reason=Without an expert opinion this paragraph is OR. It can also be argued just as persuasively it shows the weakness of an occupying power that they perceive the need to expel.}}{{Or|date=June 2010}} . 

The reason given for ethnic cleansing is usually that the targeted community is potentially or actually hostile to the "approved" population.{{Weasel-inline|date=June 2010}} Suddenly your neighbour becomes a "danger" to you and your children. In giving in to the FUD, you become as much a victim of political manipulation as the targeted group. Although ethnic cleansing has sometimes been motivated by claims that an ethnic group is literally "unclean" (as in the case of the [[Jews in the Middle Ages|Jews of medieval Europe]]), it has generally been a deliberate (if brutal) way of ensuring the complete domination of a region.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010|reason=Without an expert opinion this paragraph is OR. Who says it is the usual reason}}{{Or|date=June 2010}} . 

In the 1990s [[Bosnian war]], ethnic cleansing was a common phenomenon. It typically entailed intimidation, forced expulsion and/or killing of the undesired ethnic group, as well as the destruction or removal of key physical and cultural elements. These included places of worship, cemeteries, works of art and historic buildings. According to numerous ICTY verdicts, both Serb<ref name="ICTY: Radoslav Brđanin judgement">{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/icty/brdjanin/trialc/judgement/index.htm|title=ICTY: Radoslav Brđanin judgement}}</ref> and Croat<ref name="ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict">{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/icty/kordic/trialc/judgement/index.htm|title=ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict}}</ref> forces performed ethnic cleansing of their intended territories in order to create ethnically pure states ([[Republika Srpska]] and [[Herzeg-Bosnia]]). Serb forces were also judged to have committed [[Srebrenica genocide|genocide in Srebrenica]] at the end of the war. <ref>ICTY; "Address by ICTY President Theodor Meron, at Potočari Memorial Cemetery" The Hague, June 23, 2004 [http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2004/p860-e.htm]</ref>
[[File:Poles-expulsion-1939.jpg|thumb|[[Expulsion of Poles by Germany|Mass expulsion of Poles]] in 1939 as part of the German ethnic cleansing of western Poland annexed to the Reich.]]
Based on the evidence of numerous attacks by Croat forces against Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks), the ICTY Trial Chamber concluded in the ''Kordić and Čerkez case'' that by April 1993, the Croat leadership from Bosnia and Herzegovina had a designated plan to [[Lašva Valley ethnic cleansing|ethnically cleanse Bosniaks from the Lašva Valley]] in Central Bosnia. [[Dario Kordić]], the local political leader, was found to be the [[wikt:instigator|instigator]] of this plan. <ref name="ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict - IV.

In the same year (1993), ethnic cleansing was also occurring in another country. During the [[War in Abkhazia|Georgian-Abkhaz conflict]], the armed [[Abkhazia|Abkhaz]] [[separatist]] insurgency implemented a campaign of [[Ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia|ethnic cleansing]] against the large population of ethnic Georgians.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010|reason=Without an NEUTRAL expert opinion this sentence is OR. Who says it was ethnic cleansing}} This was actually a case of trying to drive out a majority, rather than a minority, since Georgians were the single largest ethnic group in pre-war Abkhazia, with a 45.7% plurality as of 1989. <ref>US State Department, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1993, Abkhazia case. </ref> As a result of this deliberate campaign by the Abkhaz separatists, more than 250,000 ethnic Georgians were forced to flee, and approximately 30,000 people were killed during separate incidents involving massacres and expulsions (see [[Ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia]]). <ref>Chervonnaia, Svetlana Mikhailovna. ''Conflict in the Caucasus: Georgia, Abkhazia, and the Russian Shadow.'' Gothic Image Publications, 1994. </ref><ref>US State Department, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1993, February 1994, Chapter 17. </ref> This was recognized as ethnic cleansing by [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] conventions, and was also mentioned in [[UN General Assembly Resolution]] GA/10708. <ref>[http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2008/ga10708.doc.htm General Assembly Adopts Resolution Recognizing Right Of Return By Refugees, Internally Displaced Persons To Abkhazia, Georgia<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> . 

As a tactic, ethnic cleansing has a number of systemic impacts. It enables a force to eliminate civilian support for resistance by eliminating the civilians — recognizing [[Mao Zedong]]'s dictum that guerrillas among a civilian population are fish in water, it removes the fish by draining the water{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. When enforced as part of a political settlement, as happened with the [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|forced resettlement of ethnic Germans to the new Germany]] after 1945, it can contribute to long-term stability. <ref>Judt, Tony. ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945'' Penguin Press, 2005</ref> Some individuals of the large German population in [[Czechoslovakia]] and prewar [[Poland]] had encouraged Nazi [[jingoism]] before the Second World War, but this was forcibly resolved. <ref>Tony Judt ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945'' Penguin Press, 2005. </ref> It thus establishes "[[facts on the ground]]" – radical demographic changes which can be very hard to reverse.  . 

For the most part, ethnic cleansing is such a brutal tactic and so often accompanied by large-scale bloodshed that it is widely reviled. It is generally regarded as lying somewhere between [[population transfer]]s and [[genocide]] on a scale of odiousness, and is treated by [[international law]] as a [[war crime]]. Ethnic cleansing may be seen as a policy aimed to stabilise the borders of the State.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010|reason=Without an expert opinion this paragraph is OR.|reason=As we have a definition section why do we have this paragraph here?}}{{Or|date=June 2010}}

==Ethnic cleansing as a crime under international law==. 
There is no formal legal definition of ethnic cleansing. <ref>Ward Ferdinandusse, [http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol15/No5/9.pdf The Interaction of National and International Approaches in the Repression of International Crimes], The European Journal of International Law Vol. 15 no.5 (2004), p. 1042, note 7. </ref> However, ethnic cleansing in the broad sense – the forcible deportation of a population – is defined as a crime against humanity under the statutes of both [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY). <ref>[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm ''Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court''], Article 7; [http://www.un.org/icty/legaldoc-e/index.htm ''Updated Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia''], Article 5. </ref> The gross human-rights violations integral to stricter definitions of ethnic cleansing are treated as separate crimes falling under the definitions for genocide or crimes against humanity of the statutes. <ref>Daphna Shraga and Ralph Zacklin [http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol5/No3/art4-01.html "The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia"], The European Journal of International Law Vol. 15 no.3 (2004). </ref> . 

The UN Commission of Experts (established pursuant to [[Security Council Resolution 780]]) held that the practices associated with ethnic cleansing "constitute crimes against humanity and can be assimilated to specific war crimes. Furthermore ... such acts could also fall within the meaning of the Genocide Convention." The UN General Assembly condemned "ethnic cleansing" and racial hatred in a 1992 resolution. <ref>[http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/47/a47r080.htm A/RES/47/80] ""Ethnic cleansing" and racial hatred" United Nations. December 16, 1992. Retrieved on 2006, 09–03</ref> . 

There are however situations, such as the [[expulsion of Germans after World War II]], where ethnic cleansing has taken place without legal redress (see [[Preussische Treuhand v. Poland|''Preussische Treuhand'' v. Poland]]). [[Timothy V. Waters]] argues that if similar circumstances arise in the future, this precedent would allow the ethnic cleansing of other populations under international law. <ref>[http://law.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4600&context=expresso Timothy V. Waters, ''On the Legal Construction of Ethnic Cleansing''], Paper 951, 2006, [[University of Mississippi]] School of Law. Retrieved on 2006, 12–13</ref> . 

<!--The emergence of ethnic cleansing as a distinct category of war crime has been a somewhat complex process. Each individual element of a programme of ethnic cleansing could be considered as an individual violation of humanitarian law - a killing here, a house-burning there – thus missing the systematic way in which such violations were perpetrated with a single aim in mind. International courts therefore consider individual incidents in the light of a possible pattern of ethnic cleansing. In the Yugoslav case, for instance, the ICTY considers the widespread massacres and abuses of human rights in Bosnia and Kosovo as part of an overall "joint criminal enterprise" to carve out ethnically pure states in the region.  . 

However, many alleged "ethnic cleansings" in the past do not fit the modern definition of "crimes against humanity."  For example, the post-WW2 [[German expulsions]] were sanctioned by the international agreement at [[Potsdam conference]], requiring that the actions proceed humanely.--> . 

==Silent ethnic cleansing== . 

'''Silent ethnic cleansing''' is a term coined in the mid-1990s by some observers of the [[Yugoslav wars]].  Apparently concerned with Western media representations of atrocities committed in the conflict — which generally focused on those perpetrated by the [[Serbs]] — atrocities committed against Serbs were dubbed "silent", on the grounds that they were not receiving adequate coverage. <ref>Krauthammer, Charles: "When Serbs Are 'Cleansed,' Moralists Stay Silent", ''International Herald Tribune'', August 12, 1995. </ref> . 

Since that time, the term has been used by other ethnically oriented groups for situations that they perceive to be similar — examples include both sides in Ireland's [[The Troubles|Troubles]], and the expulsion of [[Volksdeutsche|ethnic Germans]] from former German territories during and after World War II.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009|reason=needs sources for both alleged examples}} . 

Some observers,{{Who|date=August 2009}} however, assert that the term should only be used to denote population changes that do not occur as the result of overt violent action, or at least not from more or less organized aggression – the absence of such stressors being the very factor that makes it "silent", although some form of coercion is still used. The United States practiced this during the Indian Wars of the 19th century.  . 

==Instances of ethnic cleansing==. 
This section lists incidents that have been termed "ethnic cleansing" by some academic or legal experts. Not all experts agree on every case; nor do all the claims necessarily follow definitions given in this article. Where claims of ethnic cleansing originate from non-experts (e.g., journalists or politicians) this is noted.  .

Then, once Cromwell had returned to England, the English Commissary, General Henry Ireton, adopted a deliberate policy of crop burning and starvation, which was responsible for the majority of an estimated 600,000 deaths out of a total Irish population of 1,400,000."

"Of course, this has never been the Irish view of Cromwell. <br /> Most Irish remember him as the man responsible for the mass slaughter of civilians at Drogheda and Wexford and as the agent of the greatest episode of ethnic cleansing ever attempted in Western Europe as, within a decade, the percentage of land possessed by Catholics born in Ireland dropped from sixty to twenty. In a decade, the ownership of two-fifths of the land mass was transferred from several thousand Irish Catholic landowners to British Protestants. The gap between Irish and the English views of the seventeenth-century conquest remains unbridgeable and is governed by G.K. Chesterton's mirthless epigram of 1917, that "it was a tragic necessity that the Irish should remember it; but it was far more tragic that the English forgot it."

The fact that it did not include 'total' genocide in its remit, or that it failed to put into practice the vast majority of its proposed expulsions, ultimately, however, says less about the lethal determination of its makers and more about the political, structural and financial weakness of the early modern English state. </blockquote></ref><!-- GENOCIDE REF TAG END-->

*Michael Mann, basing his figures on those provided by [[Justin McCarthy (American historian)|Justin McCarthy]], states that between 1821 and 1922, a large number of Muslims were expelled from south-eastern Europe as Bulgaria, Greece and Serbia gained their independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]].

In the final Balkan wars of 1912–13 he estimates that 62 percent of Muslims (27 percent dead, 35 percent refugees) disappeared from the lands conquered by Greece, Serbia, and Bulgaria.

In the process, dozens of people died due to isolated Armenian attacks and adverse conditions. This population transfer was partially in response to Armenians being forced out of Azerbaijan, but it was also the last phase of the gradual homogenization of the republic under Soviet rule. The population transfer was the latest, and not so "gentle," episode of ethnic cleansing that increased Armenia’s homogenization from 90 percent to 98 percent.

* On July 5, 1960, five days after the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] gained independence from Belgium, the [[Force Publique]] garrison near [[Léopoldville]] mutinied against its white officers and attacked numerous European targets. This caused the fear amongst the approximately 100,000 [[white African|whites]] still resident in the Congo and led to their mass exodus from the country. <ref>[http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/united_nations_congo.htm ::UN:: History Learning Site]</ref> . 

*[[Ne Win|Ne Win's]] rise to power in 1962 and his relentless persecution of "resident aliens" (immigrant groups not recognised as citizens of the [[Union of Burma]]) led to an exodus of some 300,000 [[Burmese Indians]].

* In 1966, there was an unrest in the northern part of [[Nigeria]] that led to the death of about 80,000 people. Those killed were originally from the South Eastern region of the country and this act was seen as an attack on the [[Igbo]] people. This led [[C. Odumegwu Ojukwu]], the military governor of the Eastern region, to declare that region as a Sovereign state, [[Biafra]]. The [[Nigerian Civil War]] began on July 6, 1967, but ended in 1970 with the help of the United Kingdom and China.
