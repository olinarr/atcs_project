A '''multinational state''' is a [[sovereign state]] which is viewed as comprising two or more [[nation]]s. Such a state contrasts with a [[nation-state]] where a single nation comprises the bulk of the population. The [[United Kingdom]], the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] and [[Canada]] are viewed as present-day examples of multinational states, while [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[USSR]] and [[Yugoslavia]] are examples of historical multinational states which have since split into a number of sovereign states.  . 

A multinational state need not also be [[multiculturalism|multicultural]].  . 

Generally, in the early modern era, multinational states proved to be less successful than nation-states.  . 

Many attempts have been made to define what a multinational state is. One complicating factor is that it is possible for many of the people of what can be considered a 'nation' to consider they have two different nationalities simultaneously. As Ilan Peleg has noted, {{quote|One can be a [[Scottish people|Scot]] and a [[British people|Brit]] in the United Kingdom, a [[Jews|Jew]] and an American in the [[United States]], an [[Igbo people|Igbo]] and a Nigerian in [[Nigeria]]... One might find it hard to be a [[Slovaks|Slovak]] and a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]], an [[Arab people|Arab]] and an [[Israelis|Israeli]], a [[Breton people|Breton]] and a [[French people|Frenchman]]. <ref>Ilan Peleg, 'Classifying Multinational States' in ''Democratizing the Hegemonic State'' ([[Cambridge University Press]], 2007), pp. 78-80</ref>}} . 

==Current multinational states==. 
===Russia===. 
The present-day federal state of [[Russia]] has over a hundred and sixty different ethnic groups and indigenous peoples. The largest population is the ethnic [[Russians]], who are [[Slavs]] with [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] traditions, while the [[Tatars]] and [[Bashkirs]] have a [[Muslim]] culture. Russia also has [[Buddhist]] populations, such as the [[nomad]]ic [[Buryats]] and [[Kalmyks]], and the [[Shamanism|Shamanistic]] peoples of [[Siberia]] and the [[Extreme North (Russia)|Extreme North]], as well as the [[Finno-Ugric peoples]] of the [[Russian North West]] and the [[Volga Region]] and the peoples of the [[Northern Caucasus]], all contributing to the extreme cultural and national diversity of the country. <ref>[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_nac_02.php Ethnic groups in Russia], at demoscope.ru</ref> . 

Out of a total of more than a hundred languages which are spoken in the Russian Federation, the country has [[Languages of Russia|twenty-seven official languages]]. More than 3% of the whole population of the Federation speak [[Tatar language|Tatar]]. <ref>[http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/resources/global-etiquette/russia-country-profile.html Russia - Language, Culture, Customs and Etiquette] at kwintessential.co.uk, accessed 31 January 2011</ref> . 

In parts of the Federal state conflicts of nationality and other factors have led to secessionism, most notably in [[Chechnya]], where the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] and the [[Caucasus Emirate]] have sought independence from Russia. <ref>Tony Wood, ''Chechnya: the Case for Independence'', p. 61</ref> . 

===South Africa=== . 

The present Republic of South Africa is the successor state of the Union of South Africa, which was formed from four British colonies in 1910. The Republic has eleven official languages (Afrikaans, English, Ndebele, Pedi, Sotho, Swazi, Tsonga, Tswana, Venda, Xhosa and Zulu) and affords official recognition to several other languages spoken by ethnic minorities. Many speakers of a language may in fact be from a different nationality, for example both the Afrikaner and Coloured communities speak Afrikaans (although many Coloured consider themselves to be Afrikaners), large sections of the Indian community speak English as their home language (as do South Africans of British descent) and groups such as the Thembu and Hlubi speak dialects of Xhosa as their home language.  . 

Although certain ethic groups are associated with specific regions of South Africa, in certain areas and particularly in large cities such as Johannesburg there is widespread mixing of the various national groups found in the Republic, leading to a "melting pot" of culture. The South African government continuously attempts to unify the various nationalities in South Africa and to create the feeling of a South African identity. Struggles be South African leaders such as Nelson Mandela in this regard have been captured in films such as "Invictus".  . 

Interestingly, many of the nationalities found in South Africa are also found in countries bordering South Africa. There are more Sotho, Tswana and Swazi people living in South Africa than there are in the bordering nation states of Lesotho, Botswana and Swaziland respectively. In the past this has led to conflict. Lesotho still claims large swathes of South Africa and in the past attempts were made to cede portions of South African territory to Botswana and Swaziland. It was originally intended that these three states be incorporated in the Union of South Africa, plans that never came to fruition.  . 

===United Kingdom===.

However, until 1707, all three remained separate political entities and retained their separate political institutions. <ref name="D. Ross, 2002 p. 56"/><ref name="J.

[[Austria-Hungary]], which succeeded the [[Austrian Empire]], is a historical instance of a multinational state. The centrifugal forces within it, together with the loss of the [[First World War]], led to its breaking up in 1918, when its successor states included the [[First Austrian Republic]], the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Kingdom of Hungary]], [[Czechoslovakia]], and the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] which became part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. Parts of Austria-Hungary were also incorporated into [[Poland]], [[Ukraine]], the [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]].  . 

The Empire's principal languages were [[German language|German]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]], but there were many more besides, including [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Rusyn language|Rusyn]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]. <ref>''Volkszählung vom 31. Dezember 1910'', published in ''Geographischer Atlas zur Vaterlandskunde an der österreichischen Mittelschulen'' (Vienna, 1911)</ref> . 

===USSR=== . 

The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was a [[Political union|union]] of [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] (of which there were 15 after 1956) with the capital in [[Moscow]]. It was founded in December 1922 when the [[Russian SFSR]], which formed during the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and emerged victorious in the ensuing [[Russian Civil War]], unified with the [[Transcaucasian SSR|Transcaucasian]], [[Ukrainian SSR|Ukrainian]] and [[Belorussian SSR]]s. Addressing the Extraordinary Eighth Congress of Soviets of the U.S.S.R. on 25 November 1936, Stalin stated that "within the Soviet Union there are about sixty nations, national groups and nationalities. The Soviet state is a multi-national state."<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1936/11/25.htm On the Draft Constitution of the U.S.S.R] marxists.org, accessed 15 January 2011</ref> . 

In the late 1980s, some constituent republics of the Soviet Union started legal moves towards or even declaration of [[sovereignty]] over their territories, citing Article 72 of the USSR Constitution, which stated that any constituent republic was free to secede. <ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n12_v42/ai_9119705 The red blues&nbsp;— Soviet politics] by Brian Crozier, ''[[National Review]]'', 25 June 1990. </ref> On 7 April 1990, a law was passed allowing a republic to secede if more than two-thirds of that republic's residents vote for secession on a referendum. <ref>[http://www.rspp.su/sobor/conf_2006/istoki_duh_nrav_crisis.html Origins of Moral-Ethical Crisis and Ways to Overcome it] by V.A.Drozhin Honoured Lawyer of Russia. </ref> Many held their first free elections in the Soviet era for their own national legislatures in 1990. Many of these legislatures proceeded to produce legislation contradicting the Union laws in what was known as the "[[War of Laws]]".  . 

In 1989, the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], which was then the largest constituent republic (with about half of the population) convened a newly elected Congress of People's Deputies. [[Boris Yeltsin]] was elected the chairman of the Congress. On 12 June 1990, the Congress [[Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|declared Russia's sovereignty over its territory]] and proceeded to pass laws that attempted to supersede some of the USSR's laws. The period of legal uncertainty continued throughout 1991 as constituent republics slowly became [[de facto]] independent.  . 

A [[Soviet Union referendum, 1991|referendum for the preservation of the USSR]] was held on 17 March 1991, with the majority of the population voting for preservation of the Union in nine out of 15 republics. The referendum gave Gorbachev a minor boost, and, in the summer of 1991, the [[New Union Treaty]] was designed and agreed upon by eight republics which would have turned the Soviet Union into a much looser federation. The signing of the treaty, however, was interrupted by the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|August Coup]]—an attempted [[coup d'état]] against Gorbachev by hardline Communist Party members of the government and the KGB, who sought to reverse Gorbachev's reforms and reassert the central government's control over the republics. After the coup collapsed, Yeltsin—who had publicly opposed it—came out as a hero while Gorbachev's power was effectively ended. The balance of power tipped significantly towards the republics. In August 1991, Latvia and Estonia immediately declared restoration of full independence (following Lithuania's 1990 example), while the other twelve republics continued discussing new, increasingly looser, models of the Union.  . 

On 8 December 1991, the presidents of Russia, [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]] signed the [[Belavezha Accords]] which declared the Soviet Union dissolved and established the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) in its place. While doubts remained over the authority of the Belavezha Accords to dissolve the Union, on 21 December 1991, the representatives of all Soviet republics except [[Georgian SSR|Georgia]], including those republics that had signed the Belavezha Accords, signed the [[Alma-Ata Protocol]], which confirmed the dismemberment and consequential extinction of the USSR and restated the establishment of the CIS. The summit of [[Alma-Ata]] also agreed on several other practical measures consequential to the extinction of the Union. On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev yielded to the inevitable and resigned as the president of the USSR, declaring the office extinct. He turned the powers that until then were vested in the presidency over to [[Boris Yeltsin]], [[President of the Russian Federation|president of Russia]].  . 

The following day, the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]], the highest governmental body of the Soviet Union, recognized the bankruptcy and collapse of the Soviet Union and dissolved itself. This is generally recognized as the official, final dissolution of the Soviet Union as a functioning state. Many organizations such as the [[Soviet Army]] and police forces continued to remain in place in the early months of 1992 but were slowly phased out and either withdrawn from or were absorbed by the newly independent states.  . 

===Yugoslavia===. 
[[File:Breakup of Yugoslavia.gif|thumb|right|250px|Breakup of [[SFR Yugoslavia]].]]
The first country to be known by this name was the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], which before 3 October 1929 was known as the ''Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes''. It was established on 1 December 1918 by the union of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] (to which the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]] was annexed on 13 November 1918, and the Conference of Ambassadors in [[Paris]] gave international recognition to the union on 13 July 1922). <ref>http://www.orderofdanilo.org/en/family/index.htm</ref> The Kingdom of Yugoslavia was invaded by the [[Axis powers]] in 1941, and because of the events that followed, was officially abolished in 1943 and 1945.  . 

The second country with this name was the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, proclaimed in 1943 by the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] resistance movement during [[World War II]]. It was renamed to the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia in 1946, when a communist government was established. In 1963, it was renamed again to the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFRY). This was the largest Yugoslav state, as [[Istria]] and [[Rijeka]] were added to the new Yugoslavia after the end of World War II.  . 

The constituent six Socialist Republics and two Socialist Autonomous Provinces that made up the country were: [[SR Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[SR Croatia]], [[SR Macedonia]], [[SR Montenegro]], [[SR Slovenia]] and [[SR Serbia]] (including the [[Autonomy|autonomous]] provinces of [[SAP Vojvodina]] and [[SAP Kosovo]] which after 1974 were largely equal to the other members of the federation<ref>{{cite book |last=Huntington |first=Samuel P. |title=[[The Clash of Civilizations|The clash of civilizations and the remaking of world order]] |publisher=Simon & Schuster |ISBN=0-684-84441-9 |year=1996 |page=260}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/kosovo/110492.stm |title=History, bloody history |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=March 24, 1999 |accessdate=December 29, 2010}}</ref>).  . 

Starting in 1991, the SFRY disintegrated in the [[Yugoslav Wars]] which followed the [[secession]] of most of the country's constituent entities. The next Yugoslavia, known as the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], existed until 2003, when it was renamed [[Serbia and Montenegro]], but in 2006 this state finally separated into [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]].  .
