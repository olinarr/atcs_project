'''Social integration''', in [[sociology]] and other [[social sciences]], is the movement of minority groups such as [[ethnic minorities]], refugees and underprivileged sections of a [[society]] into the mainstream of societies. Social integration requires proficiency in an accepted common language of the society, acceptance of the laws of the society and adoption of a common set of values of the society. It does not require assimilation and it does not require persons to give up all of their culture, but it may require to forgo some aspects of their culture which are inconsistent with the laws and values of the society. In tolerant and open societies, members of minority groups can often use social integration to gain full access to the opportunities, rights and services available to the members of the mainstream of society.  . 

In the emerging world of [[social networking]] applications on the internet, social integration is a term that can be considered when members are being transparent in all of their various work, personal, faith and local community interactions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} .
