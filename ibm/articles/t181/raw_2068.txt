'''Muscular liberalism''' is a form of [[liberalism]] advocated by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] that describes his policy towards [[state multiculturalism]]. <ref>{{cite news |title=State multiculturalism has failed, says David Cameron |author= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12371994 |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |date=5 February 2011 |accessdate=11 February 2011}}</ref> . 

Cameron coined the term in a speech in [[Munich]] on 5 February 2011.  According to [[David Cameron]], "Under the doctrine of state multiculturalism, we have encouraged different cultures to live separate lives, apart from each other and apart from the mainstream.  We've failed to provide a vision of society to which they feel they want to belong."<ref>{{cite news |title=Muslims must embrace our British values, David Cameron says |author= |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/david-cameron/8305346/Muslims-must-embrace-our-British-values-David-Cameron-says.html |newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]] |date=5 February 2011 |accessdate=11 February 2011}}</ref> . 

Critics and speculators believe{{Who|date=March 2012}} "muscular [[liberalism]]" will be the new "[[ism]]" which [[United Kingdom|Britain]] will follow to tackle growing [[religious terrorism]] and extremism, subsequently adapted by all [[Europe|European]] countries including [[Commonwealth Nations]]. <ref>{{cite news |title=Cameron signs up to muscular liberalism |first=Peter |last=Hoskin |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/6674168/cameron-signs-up-to-muscular-liberalism.thtml |newspaper=[[The Spectator]] |date=5 February 2011 |accessdate=11 February 2011}}</ref> . 

==Principles==. 
The theory is that multiculturalism has shifted from tolerating multiple cultures to tolerating multiple value systems, which can be hostile to liberalism. <ref>{{cite news |title=Muscle v multiculturalism |author= |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18112127 |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=10 February 2011 |accessdate=11 February 2011}}</ref> . 

Cameron delivered these principles during a speech on Radicalization and the causes of
Terrorism at [[European Union]] international conference on Security Policy in [[Munich]]
to tackle growing terrorism so as to be less passive towards religious hate and whip
against growing extremist activists through Muscular Liberalism.  . 

===Muscular===. 
* Ban preachers of hate from coming to the host country. 
* Strictly prevent the allocation of public money and donations to groups not being used to tackle extremists. 
* Barring organisations that incite terrorism at host country and abroad. 
* Judging the religious organisations acceptability to operate in host country based on universal human rights, support for democracy and encourage integration with host country basic values. 
* Strengthening national identity by allowing people to follow their religion but subscribe to the  identity of their host country, by saying "I am a [[Muslim]], I am a [[Hindu]], I am a [[Christian]], but I am a [[London]]er too". 
* Prevention of extremism in universities and prisons.  . 

===Liberalism===. 
* Promoting ideals of [[democracy]] where people elect their own government. 
* Promoting [[universal human rights]] with equal rights to women and people of other faiths. 
* [[Freedom of worship]] and speech. 
* Promoting equal rights irrespective of race, sex or sexuality. 
* The [[rule of law]].  . 

==Reaction==. 
The speech and the principles angered the [[Muslim]] group as [[David Cameron]] called for
a tougher stance against [[islamist terrorism]] while differentiating [[Islam]] from [[Islamic terrorism]] as an ideology which attracted people who feel "rootless" within their own countries.  . 

According to [[Baroness Neville-Jones]], Security Minister of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], extremism meant all forms but not just islamist extremism. [[Ajmal Masroor]], of the [[Islamic Society of Britain]],  rejected it, saying that national identity, multiculturalism and extremism are not connected.  . 

[[President of France|President]] [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] of [[France]] has said that he agrees with Cameron. <ref>{{cite news |title=Multiculturalism has failed, says French president |author= |url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110210/wl_afp/francepoliticsimmigrationsociety_20110210231042 |newspaper=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=10 February 2011 |accessdate=11 February 2011}}</ref> . 

==Influences==. 
It is generally recognised that Cameron was influenced by Sir Karl Popper when he wrote about the "[[Karl Popper#The paradox of tolerance|paradox of tolerance]]". When intolerance is tolerated, tolerance itself is threatened.  .
