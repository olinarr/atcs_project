'''Multiculturalism in Canada''' in the sense of equal acceptance of races, religions and cultures was adopted as the official policy of the [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]] during the prime ministership of [[Pierre Elliot Trudeau]] in the 1970s and 1980s.{{r|duncan-1983}} The Canadian government has been described as the instigator of [[multiculturalism]] as an ideology because of its public emphasis on the [[Economic impact of immigration to Canada|social importance of immigration]].{{r|wayland-1997}}  The Canadian [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]] is often referred to as the origin of modern political awareness of multiculturalism. <ref name="II2010.">{{cite book|author=Ronald L.

Canadians have used the term “multiculturalism” to discuss the many different groups of religions and cultures that make up the population in Canada. The nation consists several racial origins and is open to cultural pluralism as it is believed to be advantageous to the Canadian society as a whole. Canada is a nation that consists of many foreigners and almost 40 percent of the population are neither British or from a French background. In the past, the relationship between the British and the French has been given a lot of importance in Canada’s history. But in today’s day, people from outside British and French heritage compose most of Canada’s <ref>Troper.H (2012).

Multiculturalism is reflected in the law through the [[Canadian Multiculturalism Act]] and [[section 27 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] and is  administered by the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]]. The [[Broadcasting Act (1991)|Broadcasting Act]] of 1991 asserts the Canadian broadcasting system should reflect the diversity of cultures in the country. Despite the  official policies, segments of the Canadian population are critical of the concept(s)  of a [[cultural mosaic]] and implantation(s) of multiculturalism. <ref name="NelsonNelson2004">{{cite book|author1=Charmaine Nelson|author2=Camille Antoinette Nelson|title=Racism, Eh?: a critical inter-disciplinary anthology of race and racism in Canada|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0zyL163nF8sC&pg=PA445|year=2004|publisher=Captus Press|isbn=978-1-55322-061-9|page=445}}</ref> .

===Settlement=== . 

Culturally diverse areas or [[ethnic enclaves]] are another way in which multiculturalism in Canada has been strengthened. In 1981, Canada only had 6 enclaves in the cities of Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver, but that number  drastically increased to over 250 as of 2010. <ref>{{cite paper|author=Hou, F., & Picot, G|year=2003|title= Visible minority neighbourhood enclaves and labor market outcomes of immigrants: Analytical studies branch research paper series|url=http://volunteer.envision.ca/pdf/w2w/11F0019MIE2003204.pdf |publisher=Statistics Canada|pages= 1-32|isbn= 0-662-34512-6}}</ref><ref name= "Todd"/> These enclaves act as a home away from home for immigrants to Canada, while providing a new experience of different cultures for those of Canadian decent. In Canada, there are several [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] communities with many diverse backgrounds, including Chinese, Italian, Greek, and many others. <ref name="Zucchi">{{cite paper|author=Zucchi, J|year=2007|title= A history of ethnic enclaves in Canada|publisher=Canadian Historical Association|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/008004/f2/E-31_en.pdf|pages= 1-25|isbn=0-88798-266-2}}</ref> Chinatown(s) are one of the most popular type of ethnic enclaves in Canada. <ref name="Zucchi"/> This area attempts to recreate an authentic Chinese experience for Canadians. During first half of the 20th century Chinatown(s) were associated with filth, seediness, and the derelict. <ref name="Zucchi"/> By the late 20th century  Chinatown(s) had become areas worth preserving, a tourist attraction. <ref name="Zucchi"/>  They are now generally valued for their cultural significance and  have become an important feature of most large Canadian cities. <ref name= "Zucchi"/>  Professor John Zucchi of [[McGill University]] states:<ref name= "Zucchi"/>  . 

{{Quotation| Unlike earlier periods when significant ethnic segregation might imply a lack of integration and therefore be viewed as a social problem, nowadays ethnic concentration in residential areas is a sign of vitality and indicates that multiculturalism as a social policy has been successful, that ethnic groups are retaining their identities if they so wish, and old-world cultures are being preserved at the same time that ethnic groups are being integrated. In addition these neighbourhoods, like their cultures, add to the definition of a city and point to the fact that integration is a two-way street."
}} . 

These areas across Canada contain many similarities to the countries they are imitating, especially through the use of ethnic traditions. According to a study conducted by The [[University of Victoria]], many Canadians do not feel a strong sense of belonging in Canada, or cannot integrate themselves into society as a result of ethnic enclaves. <ref name= "Todd">{{cite web|author=Todd, D|date= September 11, 2010|title= Growing Ethnic Enclaves Hurt Sense Of Canadian "Belonging"|publisher= (The Vancouver Sun) Immigration Watch Canada|url=http://www.immigrationwatchcanada.org/2010/09/11/growing-ethnic-enclaves-hurt-sense-of-canadian-belonging/}}</ref> Many immigrants to Canada choose to live in ethnic enclaves because it can be much easier than fitting in with mainstream [[Canadian culture]]. <ref name= "Todd"/> Canada has many ethnocentric areas, which can provide a sense of comfort and security to immigrants, and also create a sense of familiarity in a new place.  . 

==Federal evolution of legislation  ==. 
The compromises  made between the English and French speaking [[Fathers of Confederation]] during the 1860s set Canada on a path to [[Multilingualism|bilingualism]], and this in turn contributed to [[biculturalism]] and the acceptance of diversity. <ref name="Coche">{{cite book|author=François Vaillancourt, Olivier Coche|title=Official Language Policies at the Federal Level in Canada:costs and Benefits in 2006|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QCZm8op2bjQC&pg=PA11|publisher=The Fraser Institute|page=11|id=GGKEY:B3Y7U7SKGUD}}</ref> [[John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir|Lord Tweedsmuir]] the 15th [[Governor General of Canada]] was an early champion of multiculturalism;<ref name="HillmerChapnick2007">{{cite book|author1=Norman Hillmer|author2=Adam Chapnick|title=Canadas of the mind: the making and unmaking of Canadian nationalisms in the twentieth century|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kBmHB5ls_ZUC&pg=PA191|date= September 1, 2007|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-3273-1|page=191}}</ref> from his installation speech in 1935 onwards, he maintained in speeches and over the radio recited his ideas that ethnic groups "should retain their individuality and each make its contribution to the national character," and "the strongest nations are those that are made up of different racial elements."{{r|saunders-2009}}  . 

Multiculturalism was coming to an understanding in the country and the idea was promoted by scholars who help integrate this aspect into the Canadian Society. After World War II, the idea of biculturalism strengthened and in the first stage it was about a large-scale immigration that became a part of national life. People from different nations came together to promote the aspect of bilingualism and biculturalism. <ref>{{cite web|author= Troper.H |year=2012|title= Multiculturalism|publisher= Multicultural Canada|accessdate= March 28, 2012 |url= http://www.multiculturalcanada.ca/Encyclopedia/A-Z/m9}}</ref> .

People are free to practise their religion. No one from another cultural background in Canada is forced to leave their culture and adopt the Canadian culture. Everyone is given the full right to preserve all of their cultural values. Section 3 (b) of the Canada's multiculturalism policy states:<ref name="Black-BranchAssociation1995"/>  .

=== Broadcasting Act=== . 

{{main|Multicultural media in Canada}}
In the Multiculturalism Act, the federal government proclaimed the recognition of the diversity of Canadian culture. <ref name="Mansell">{{cite book|author1=Robin Mansell|author2=Marc Raboy|title=The Handbook of Global Media and Communication Policy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wKUNVtyHRZ8C&pg=PA149|date= April 12, 2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-9541-9|pages=149–151}}</ref> Similarly the [[Broadcasting Act]] of 1991 asserts the Canadian broadcasting system should reflect the diversity of cultures in the country. <ref name="RaboyMcIver2010">{{cite book|author1=Marc Raboy|author2=William J.

According to the act, 60% of programming on a channel, whether on the radio or television, has to be considered ethnic in order to be approved for the license under this policy. <ref name=Mansell /> . 

==Provincial evolution of legislation==  . 

All ten of Canada's provinces have some form of multiculturalism policy. <ref name=PIRS>{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/prb0920-e.htm#D-Provincial|publisher=Staff of the Parliamentary Information and Research Service (PIRS)|title=Canadian Multiculturalism|year=2009|accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref> A total of six provinces - [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Quebec]] and [[Nova Scotia]] have authorized multiculturalism legislation,<ref name=PIRS/> while eight of the provinces - British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, [[Manitoba]], Quebec, [[New Brunswick]], [[Prince Edward Island ]]and Nova Scotia - have a advisory council that reports to the minister responsible for multiculturalism within the province. <ref name=PIRS/> . 

; British Columbia : British Columbia legislated the ''Multiculturalism Act'' in 1993. <ref name=PIRS/> The purposes of this act (s. 2)<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.leg.bc.ca/35th2nd/1st_read/gov39-1.htm#section2|publisher=Queen’s Printer|title=Multicultiralism Act|year=1993|accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref> are: 
*to recognize that the diversity of British Columbians as regards race, cultural heritage, religion, ethnicity, ancestry and place of origin is a fundamental characteristic of the society of British Columbia that enriches the lives of all British Columbians;
*to encourage respect for the multicultural heritage of British Columbia;
*to promote racial harmony, cross cultural understanding and respect and the development of a community that is united and at peace with itself;
*to foster the creation of a society in British Columbia in which there are no impediments to the full and free participation of all British Columbians in the economic, social, cultural and political life of British Columbia.  . 

; Alberta : Alberta primarily legislated the ''Alberta Cultural Heritage Act'' in 1984 and refined it with the ''Alberta Multiculturalism Act'' in 1990. <ref name=PIRS/> The current legislation pertaining to multiculturalism is ''The Human Rights, Citizenship and Multiculturalism Act'' that passed in 1996. <ref name=PIRS/> This current legislation deals with discrimination in race, religious beliefs, colour, gender, physical disability, age, marital status and sexual orientation, among other things. <ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.albertahumanrights.ab.ca/ProtAreasGrounds.pdf|publisher=Human Rights Commission|title=Protected Area and Grounds under the Alberta Human Rights Act|year=2012|accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref>  . 

; Saskatchewan : Saskatchewan was the first Canadian province to adopt legislation on multiculturalism. <ref name=PIRS/> This piece of legislation was called ''The Saskatchewan Multiculturalism Act'' of 1974, but has since been replaced by new, revised ''Multiculturalism Act'' (1997). <ref name=PIRS/> The purposes of this act (s. 3)<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/English/Statutes/Statutes/M23-01.pdf|publisher=Statutes of Saskatchewan |title=The Multiculturalism Act|year=1997|accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref> are similar to those of British Columbia:
*to recognize that the diversity of Saskatchewan people with respect to race, cultural heritage, religion, ethnicity, ancestry and place of origin is a fundamental characteristic of Saskatchewan society that enriches the lives of all Saskatchewan people;
*to encourage respect for the multicultural heritage of Saskatchewan;
*to foster a climate for harmonious relations among people of diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds without sacrificing their distinctive cultural and ethnic identities;
*to encourage the continuation of a multicultural society.  . 

; Manitoba : Manitoba's first piece of legislation on multiculturalism was the ''Manitoba Intercultural Council Act'' in 1984. <ref name=PIRS/> However in the summer on 1992, the province developed a new provincial legislation called the ''Multiculturalism Act''. <ref name=PIRS/> The purposes of this act (s. 2)<ref>{{cite web|url= http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/ccsm/m223e.php|publisher=Manitoba |title=The Manitoba Multiculturalism Act|year=1992|accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref> are to:

*enhance the opportunities of Manitoba's multicultural society by acting in partnership with all cultural communities and by encouraging cooperation and partnerships between cultural communities . 

; Ontario : Ontario had a policy in place in 1977 that promoted cultural activity, but formal legislation for a Ministry of Citizenship and Culture (now known as Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration) only came to fruition in 1982. <ref name=PIRS/> The ''Ministry of Citizenship and Culture Act'' (1990) (s. 4)<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/Download?dDocName=elaws_statutes_90m18_e|publisher=e-Laws |title=The Ministry of Citizen and Culture Act|year=1990|accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref> states its purpose:
*to encourage full, equal and responsible citizenship among the residents of Ontario;
*recognizing the pluralistic nature of Ontario society, to stress the full participation of all Ontarians as equal members of the community, encouraging the sharing of cultural heritage while affirming those elements held in common by all residents;
*to ensure the creative and participatory nature of cultural life in Ontario by assisting in the stimulation of cultural expression and cultural preservation;
*to foster the development of individual and community excellence, enabling Ontarians to better define the richness of their diversity and the shared vision of their community.   . 

; Quebec : Quebec differs from the rest of the nine provinces in that it's policy focuses on "interculturalism"- rather then multiculturalism, where diversity is strongly encouraged, but only under the notion that it is within the framework that establishes supremacy of the French language and the French culture. <ref name=PIRS/> In 1990, Quebec released a [[White_paper]] called ''Lets Build Quebec Together: A Policy Statement on Integration and Immigration'' which reinforced three main points<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2009/Koji.pdf |publisher= Junichiro Koji |title=Policy Networks and Policy Change: Explaining Immigrant Integration Policy Evolution in Quebec |year=2009|accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref>
*Quebec is a French-speaking society
*Quebec is a democratic society in which everyone is expected to contribute to public life
*Quebec is a pluralistic society that respects the diversity of various cultures from within a democratic framework  . 

In 2005, Quebec passed legislation to develop the ''Ministry of Immigration and Cultural Communities'', their functions were:<ref name=PIRS/>
*to support cultural communities in order to facilitate their full participation in Quebec society
*to foster openness to pluralism; and
*to foster closer intercultural relations among the people of Quebec.  . 

; New Brunswick : New Brunswick first introduced their multicultural legislation in 1986. <ref name=PIRS/> The policy is guided by four principles: equality, appreciation, preservation of cultural heritages and participation. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/post-secondary_education_training_and_labour/population_growth/content/new_brunswick_s_multiculturalismpolicy.html|publisher=The Government of New Brunswick|title=New Brunswick Multicultural Policy|year=2012|accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref>In the 1980's the provincial government developed a Ministerial Advisory Committee to provide assistance to the minister of Business in New Brunswick, who is in turn responsible for settlement and multicultural communities. <ref name=PIRS/> . 

; Nova Scotia : Nova Scotia introduced their multicultural legislation, the ''Act to Promote and Preserve Multiculturalism'', in 1989. <ref name=PIRS/> The purpose of this Act is (s. 3)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nslegislature.ca/legc/statutes/multicul.htm|publisher=Office of the Legislative Counsel|title=Multiculturalism Act|year=1989|accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref>:

*establishing a climate for harmonious relations among people of diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds without sacrificing their distinctive cultural and ethnic identities;
*encouraging the continuation of a multicultural society as a mosaic of different ethnic groups and cultures . 

; Prince Edward Island : Prince Edward Island introduced their legislation on multiculturalism, the ''Provincial Multicultural Policy'', in 1988. <ref name=PIRS/> This policies objectives were (s. 4)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.pe.ca/photos/original/cca_multi_engli.pdf|publisher=Government of P.E.I|title=Provincial Multicultural Policy|year=1989|accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref>:

*encourage specific legislative, political and social commitments to multiculturalism in Prince Edward Island . 

; Newfoundland and Labrador : Newfoundland and Labrador first legislated their Policy on Multiculturalism in 2008. <ref name=PIRS/> Some of the policies are to:<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.nlimmigration.ca/media/9255/multi%20policy.pdf|publisher= Government of Newfoundland and Labrador|title=Multiculturalism Policy|year=2012|accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref>
