'''Toleration''' is "the practice of deliberately allowing or permitting a thing of which one disapproves. One can meaningfully speak of tolerating, ie of allowing or permitting, only if one is in a position to disallow”. It has also been defined as "to bear or endure" or "to nourish, sustain or preserve". Toleration may signify “no more than forbearance and the permission given by the adherents of a dominant religion for other religions to exist, even though the latter are looked on with disapproval as inferior, mistaken or harmful”. <ref>Perez Zagorin, ''How the Idea of Religious Toleration Came to the West'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press 2003) ISBN 0691092702 , pp. 5–6, quoting D.D. Raphael et al. </ref> . 

There is only one verb 'to tolerate' and one adjective 'tolerant', but the two nouns 'tolerance' and 'toleration' have evolved slightly different meanings. Tolerance is an attitude of mind that implies non-judgmental acceptance of different lifestyles or beliefs, whereas toleration implies putting up with something that one disapproves of.  . 

Historically, most incidents and writings pertaining to toleration involve the status of minority and dissenting viewpoints in relation to a dominant [[state religion]]. In the twentieth century and after, analysis of the doctrine of toleration has been expanded to include political and ethnic groups, homosexuals and other minorities, and [[human rights]] embodies the principle of legally enforced toleration.  . 

==In antiquity==. 
As reported in the [[Old Testament]], the Persian king [[Cyrus the Great]] was believed to have released the Jews from captivity in 539–530 BC, and permitted their return to their homeland. <ref>Book of Ezra, [http://www.kingjamesbibletrust.org/the-king-james-bible/ezra ''King James Bible''] Accessed March 21, 2011</ref> . 

The [[Hellenistic empire|Hellenistic]] city of [[Alexandria]], founded 331 BC, contained a large Jewish community which lived in peace with equivalently sized Greek and Egyptian populations. According to [[Michael Walzer]], the city provided "a useful example of what we might think of as the imperial version of multiculturalism." <ref>Michael Walzer, ''On Toleration'' (New Haven: Yale University Press 1997) ISBN 0300076002 p. 17</ref> . 

The [[Roman Empire]] encouraged conquered peoples to continue worshipping their own gods. "An important part of Roman propaganda was its invitation to the gods of conquered territories to enjoy the benefits of worship within the ''imperium''."<ref>Witte, John Jr. and Johan D. van de Vyver, ''Religious Human Rights in Global Perspective'' (The Hague: Kluwer 1996) p. 74 ISBN 9041101764</ref> Christians were singled out for persecution because of their own rejection of Roman pantheism and refusal to honor the emperor as a god. <ref>Logan, Donald F., ''A history of the church in the Middle Ages'' (New York:Routledge, 2002) ISBN 0415132895 p. 8</ref> In 311 AD, Roman Emperor [[Galerius]] issued a general [[Edict of Toleration by Galerius|edict of toleration]] of Christianity, in his own name and in those of [[Licinius]] and [[Constantine I]] (who converted to Christianity the following year). <ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06341a.htm "Valerius Maximianus Galerius"], Karl Hoeber, Catholic Encyclopedia 1909 Ed, retrieved 1 June 2007. </ref> . 

== Biblical sources of toleration==. 
In the Old Testament, the books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]] and [[Deuteronomy]] make similar statements about the treatment of strangers. For example, Exodus 22:21 says: "Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt".These texts are frequently used in sermons to plead for compassion and tolerance of those who are different than us and less powerful. <ref>February 5, 2008 posting by Rabbi David Kominsky [http://rabbidavidkominsky.wordpress.com/2008/02/05/for-you-were-strangers-in-the-land-of-egypt/ …For You Were Strangers in the Land of Egypt]. Accessed January 25, 2011</ref> [[Julia Kristeva]] elucidated a philosophy of political and religious toleration based on all of our mutual identities as strangers. <ref>Walzer, Michael ''On Toleration'' (New Haven: Yale University Press 1997) pp. 80–81</ref> . 

The New Testament [[Parable of the Tares]], which speaks of the difficulty of distinguishing wheat from weeds before harvest time, has also been invoked in support of religious toleration. In his "Letter to Bishop Roger of Chalons", Bishop [[Wazo of Liege]] (c. 985–1048 AD) relied on the parable <ref>{{cite journal|author=Richard Landes|title=The Birth of Heresy: A Millennial Phenomenon|journal=Journal of Religious History |volume=24|issue=1|year=2000|pages=26–43 |url=http://www.bu.edu/mille/people/rlpages/TheBirthofHeresy.html|doi=10.1111/1467-9809.00099 }}</ref> to argue that "the church should let dissent grow with orthodoxy until the Lord comes to separate and judge them". <ref>Jeffrey Burton Russell, ''Dissent and Order in the Middle Ages: The Search for Legitimate Authority'' (New York: Twayne Publishers 1992), p. 23</ref> . 

[[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]], a Baptist theologian and founder of Rhode Island, used this parable to support government toleration of all of the "weeds" (heretics) in the world, because civil persecution often inadvertently hurts the "wheat" (believers) too. Instead, Williams believed it was God's duty to judge in the end, not man's. This parable lent further support to Williams' Biblical philosophy of a wall of separation between church and state as described in his 1644 book, ''[[The Bloody Tenent of Persecution]]''. <ref>{{cite book|author=James P. Byrd|title=The challenges of Roger Williams: religious liberty, violent persecution, and the Bible|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M4FK-j35yFYC|accessdate=15 June 2011|year=2002|publisher=Mercer University Press|isbn=9780865547711}}</ref> . 

==In the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance== . 

In the [[Middle Ages]], there were instances of toleration of particular groups. The Latin concept ''tolerantia'' was a "highly-developed political and judicial concept in mediaeval scholastic theology and canon law."<ref name="Walsham06-234">Walsham 2006: 234. </ref> ''Tolerantia'' was used to "denote the self-restraint of a civil power in the face of" outsiders, like infidels, Muslims or Jews, but also in the face of social groups like prostitutes and lepers. <ref name="Walsham06-234"/> Later, theologians belonging, or reacting, to, the [[Protestant Reformation]], began discussion of the circumstances under which dissenting religious thought should be permitted. Toleration "as a government-sanctioned practice" in Christian countries, "the sense on which most discussion of the phenomenon relies — is not attested before the sixteenth century". <ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/past/153.1.3}}</ref> . 

===Tolerance of the Jews===. 
In 1348, [[Pope Clement VI]] (1291–1352) issued a [[Papal bull|bull]] pleading with Catholics not to murder Jews, whom they blamed for the Black Death. He noted that Jews died of the plague like anyone else, and that the disease also flourished in areas where there were no Jews. Christians who blamed and killed Jews had been “seduced by that liar, the Devil”. He took Jews under his personal protection at Avignon, but his calls for other clergy to do so failed to be heeded. <ref>Tuchman, Barbara, A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century (New York: Alfred A. Knopf 1978), p. 113</ref> . 

[[Johann Reuchlin]] (1455–1522) was a German humanist and a scholar of Greek and Hebrew who opposed efforts by [[Johannes Pfefferkorn]], backed by the Dominicans of Cologne, to confiscate all religious texts from the Jews as a first step towards their forcible conversion to the Catholic religion. <ref>Rummel, Erika, "The case against Johann Reuchlin" (pp. iv–xv) University of Toronto Press, 2002 ISBN 0802084842, 9780802084842. </ref> . 

Despite occasional spontaneous episodes of pogroms and killings, as during the Black Death, [[Poland]] was a relatively tolerant [[Jews in Poland|home for the Jews]] in the medieval period. In 1264, the [[Statute of Kalisz]] guaranteed safety, personal liberties, [[freedom of religion]], trade, and travel to Jews. By the mid-16th century, Poland was home to 80% of the world's Jewish population. Jewish worship was officially recognized, with a Chief Rabbi originally appointed by the monarch. Jewish property ownership was also protected for much of the period, and Jews entered into business partnerships with members of the nobility. <ref>[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Poland.html Poland]. Jewish Virtual Library. Retrieved on 2011-06-15. </ref> . 

===Vladimiri===. 
[[Paulus Vladimiri]] (ca. 1370–1435) was a Polish scholar and rector who at the [[Council of Constance]] in 1414, presented a thesis, ''Tractatus de potestate papae et imperatoris respectu infidelium'' (Treatise on the Power of the Pope and the Emperor Respecting Infidels). In it he argued that pagan and Christian nations could coexist in peace and criticized the [[Teutonic Order]] for its wars of conquest of native non-Christian peoples in Prussia and Lithuania. Vladimiri strongly supported the idea of conciliarism and pioneered the notion of peaceful coexistence among nations – a forerunner of modern theories of human rights. Throughout his political, diplomatic and university career, he expressed the view that a world guided by the principles of peace and mutual respect among nations was possible and that pagan nations had a right to peace and to possession of their own lands.  . 

===Erasmus===. 
[[Desiderius Erasmus]] Roterodamus (1466–1536), was a Dutch Renaissance humanist and Catholic whose works laid a foundation for religious toleration. For example, in ''De libero arbitrio'', opposing certain views of [[Martin Luther]], Erasmus noted that religious disputants should be temperate in their language, "because in this way the truth, which is often lost amidst too much wrangling may be more surely perceived." Gary Remer writes, "Like [[Cicero]], Erasmus concludes that truth is furthered by a more harmonious relationship between interlocutors." <ref>Remer, Gary, ''Humanism and the Rhetoric of Toleration'' (University Park: University of Pennsylvania Press 1996) p. 95 ISBN 0271028114</ref> Although Erasmus did not oppose the punishment of heretics, in individual cases he generally argued for moderation and against the death penalty. He wrote, "It is better to cure a sick man than to kill him." <ref>{{cite book|author1=James Anthony Froude|author2=Desiderius Erasmus|title=Life and letters of Erasmus: lectures delivered at Oxford 1893-4|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ussXAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA359|accessdate=15 June 2011|year=1894|publisher=Longmans, Green|pages=359–}}</ref> . 

===More===. 
[[Sir Thomas More]] (1478–1535), Catholic Lord Chancellor of [[King Henry VIII]] and author, described a world of almost complete religious toleration in [[Utopia (book)|Utopia]] (1516), in which the Utopians "can hold various religious beliefs without persecution from the authorities."<ref>Marius, Richard ''Thomas More: a biography'' (Cambridge, Ma: Harvard University press, 1999) p. 175 ISBN 0674885252</ref> However, More's work is subject to various interpretations, and it is not clear that he felt that earthly society should be conducted the same way as in Utopia. Thus, in his three years as Lord Chancellor, More actively approved of the persecution of those who sought to undermine the Catholic faith in England. <ref>Marius, Richard ''Thomas More: a biography'' (Cambridge, Ma: Harvard University press, 1999) p. 386 ISBN 0674885252</ref> . 

===Castellio===. 
[[Sebastian Castellio]] (1515–1563) was a French Protestant theologian who in 1554 published under a pseudonym the pamphlet ''Whether heretics should be persecuted (De haereticis, an sint persequendi)'' criticizing [[John Calvin]]'s execution of [[Michael Servetus]]: "When Servetus fought with reasons and writings, he should have been repulsed by reasons and writings." Castellio concluded: "We can live together peacefully only when we control our intolerance. Even though there will always be differences of opinion from time to time, we can at any rate come to general understandings, can love one another, and can enter the bonds of peace, pending the day when we shall attain unity of faith."<ref>Zweig, Stefan (1951). Erasmus; The Right to Heresy: Castellio against Calvin. London: Cassell. p. 312. OCLC 24340377</ref> Castellio is remembered for the often quoted statement, "To kill a man is not to protect a doctrine, but it is to kill a man. 
<ref>Sebastian Castellio, ''Contra libellum, # 77, Vaticanus''. </ref> . 

===Bodin===. 
[[Jean Bodin]] (1530–1596) was a French Catholic jurist and political philosopher. His Latin work ''Colloquium heptaplomeres de rerum sublimium arcanis abditis'' ("The Colloqium of the Seven") portrays a conversation about the nature of truth between seven cultivated men from diverse religious or philosophical backgrounds: a natural philosopher, a Calvinist, a Muslim, a Roman Catholic, a Lutheran, a Jew, and a skeptic. All agree to live in mutual respect and tolerance.  . 

===Montaigne===. 
[[Michel de Montaigne]] (1533–1592), French Catholic essayist and statesman, moderated between the Catholic and Protestant sides in the [[Wars of Religion]]. Montaigne's theory of skepticism led to the conclusion that we cannot precipitously decide the error of other's views. Montaigne wrote in his famous "Essais": "It is putting a very high value on one's conjectures, to have a man roasted alive because of them...To kill people, there must be sharp and brilliant clarity."<ref>E.M. Curley, [http://sitemaker.umich.edu/emcurley/files/montaigneforosemp.pdf "Skepticism and Toleration: the Case of Montaigne"], Accessed February 27, 2011</ref> . 

===Edict of Torda===. 
In 1568, King [[John II Sigismund]] of Hungary, encouraged by his Unitarian Minister Francis David (Dávid Ferenc), issued the [[Edict of Torda]] decreeing religious toleration.  . 

===Maximilian II===. 
In 1571, Holy Roman Emperor [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] granted religious toleration to the nobles of Lower Austria, their families and workers. <ref>{{cite journal|title=Toleration—Exercitium Religionis Privatum|author= Walter Grossman|journal= Journal of the History of Ideas|volume= 40|issue=1|year=1979|pages=129–134|jstor=2709265|doi=10.2307/2709265}}</ref> . 

===The Warsaw Confederation===. 
[[Image:Akt Konfederacji Warszawskiej.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Original act of the [[Warsaw Confederation]] 1573. The beginning of religious freedom in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]]]
Poland has a long tradition of religious freedom. The right to worship freely was a basic right given to all inhabitants of the Commonwealth throughout the 15th and early 16th century, however, complete freedom of religion was officially recognized in Poland in 1573 during the [[Warsaw Confederation]]. Poland kept religious freedom laws during an era when religious persecution was an everyday occurrence in the rest of Europe. <ref>Zamoyski, Adam. The Polish Way. New York: Hippocrene Books, 1987</ref> . 

The [[Warsaw Confederation]] of 1573 was a private compact signed by representatives of all the major religions in Polish and Lithuanian society, in which they pledged each other mutual support and tolerance. The confederation was incorporated into the [[Henrican articles]], which constituted a virtual Polish constitution.  . 

===Edict of Nantes===. 
The [[Edict of Nantes]], issued on April 13, 1598, by [[Henry IV of France]], granted Protestants – notably [[Calvinist]] [[Huguenots]] – substantial rights in a nation where Catholicism was the state religion. The main concern was civil unity;<ref>In 1898 the tricentennial celebrated the Edict as the foundation of the coming Age of Toleration; the 1998 anniversary, by contrast, was commemorated with a book of essays under the evocatively ambivalent title, ''Coexister dans l'intolérance'' (Michel Grandjean and Bernard Roussel, editors, Geneva, 1998). </ref> The Edict separated civil law from religious rights, treated non-Catholics as more than mere schismatics and heretics for the first time, and opened a path for secularism and tolerance. In offering general freedom of conscience to individuals, the edict offered many specific concessions to the Protestants, such as amnesty and the reinstatement of their civil rights, including the right to work in any field or for the State, and to bring grievances directly to the king. The edict marked the end of the religious wars in France that tore apart the population during the second half of the 16th century.  . 

The Edict of Nantes was revoked in 1685 by [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]] with the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]], leading to renewed persecution of Protestants in France. Although strict enforcement of the revocation was relaxed during the reign of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], it was not until 102 years later, in 1787, when [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] signed the [[Edict of Versailles]] – known as the [[Edict of Tolerance]] – that civil status and rights to form congregations by Protestants were restored. <ref>[http://booking-help.org/book_338_glava_314_Edict_of_Versailles_%281787%29.html Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Ideals, ''Edict of Versailles (1787)''], downloaded 29 January 2012</ref> . 

==In the Enlightenment== . 

Beginning in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] commencing in the 1600s, politicians and commentators began formulating theories of religious toleration and basing legal codes on the concept. A distinction began to develop between ''civil tolerance'', concerned with "the policy of the state towards religious dissent".,<ref>John Coffey, ''Persecution and Toleration in Protestant England, 1558–1689''. Longman Publishing Group (2000). ISBN 0-582-30465-2. p. 11</ref> and ''ecclesiastical tolerance'', concerned with the degree of diversity tolerated within a particular church. <ref>Coffey, p. 12</ref> . 

===Milton===. 
[[John Milton]] (1608–1674), English Protestant poet and essayist, called in the ''[[Aeropagitica]]'' for "the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties" (applied however, only to the conflicting Protestant sects, and not to atheists, Jews, Moslems or even Catholics). "Milton argued for [[disestablishment]] as the only effective way of achieving broad toleration. Rather than force a man's conscience, government should recognize the persuasive force of the gospel."<ref>Hunter, William Bridges ''A Milton Encyclopedia, Volume 8''(East Brunswick, NJ: Associated University Presses, 1980) pp. 71, 72 ISBN 0838718418</ref> . 

===Rudolph II===. 
In 1609, [[Rudolph II]] decreed religious toleration in [[Bohemia]]. <ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9064359/Rudolf-II "Rudolph II"], Encyclopædia Britannica 15 Edition, retrieved 1 June 2007. </ref> . 

===In the American colonies===. 
[[Image:Large Broadside on the Maryland Toleration Act.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The [[Maryland Toleration Act]], passed in 1649.]]
In 1636, [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] and companions at the foundation of [[Rhode Island]] entered into a compact binding themselves "to be obedient to the majority only in civil things". Lucian Johnston writes, "Williams' intention was to grant an infinitely greater religious liberty than then existed anywhere in the world outside of the Colony of Maryland". In 1663, Charles II granted the colony a charter guaranteeing complete religious toleration. <ref>Johnston, Lucian, ''Religious Liberty in Maryland and Rhode Island'' (Brooklyn: International Catholic Truth Society, 1903), p. 30, 38</ref> . 

In 1649 Maryland passed the [[Maryland Toleration Act]], also known as the Act Concerning Religion, a law mandating religious tolerance for Trinitarian Christians only (excluding [[Nontrinitarian]] faiths). Passed on September 21, 1649 by the assembly of the Maryland colony, it was the first law requiring religious tolerance in the British North American colonies. The [[Calvert family]] sought enactment of the law to protect Catholic settlers and some of the other religions that did not conform to the dominant [[Anglicanism]] of Britain and her colonies.  . 

In 1657, [[New Amsterdam]] granted religious toleration to Jews. <ref>[[Hasia Diner|Hasia R. Diner]], ''The Jews of the United States, 1654 to 2000'', 2004, University of California Press, ISBN 0520248481, pp. 13–15</ref> . 

===Spinoza===. 
[[Baruch Spinoza]] (1632–1677) was a Dutch Jewish philosopher. He published the [[Theological-Political Treatise]] anonymously in 1670, arguing (according to the Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) that "the freedom to philosophize can not only be granted without injury to piety and the peace of the Commonwealth, but that the peace of the Commonwealth and Piety are endangered by the suppression of this freedom", and defending, "as a political ideal, the tolerant, secular, and democratic polity". After analyzing certain Biblical texts, Spinoza opted for tolerance and freedom of thought in his conclusion that "every person is in duty bound to adapt these religious dogmas to his own understanding and to interpret them for himself in whatever way makes him feel that he can the more readily accept them with full confidence and conviction."<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/ "Barcuch Spinoza"], revised June 2008, ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Accessed February 25, 2011</ref> . 

===Locke===. 
English philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632–1704) published [[A Letter Concerning Toleration]] in 1689. Locke's work appeared amidst a fear that Catholicism might be taking over England, and responds to the problem of religion and government by proposing religious toleration as the answer. 
Unlike [[Thomas Hobbes]], who saw uniformity of religion as the key to a well-functioning civil society, Locke argued that more religious groups actually prevent civil unrest. In his opinion, civil unrest results from confrontations caused by any magistrate's attempt to prevent different religions from being practiced, rather than tolerating their proliferation. However, Locke denies religious tolerance for Catholics, for political reasons, and also for atheists because 'Promises, covenants, and oaths, which are the bonds of human society, can have no hold upon an atheist'. A passage Locke later added to the [[Essay concerning Human Understanding]], questioned whether atheism was necessarily inimical to political obedience.  . 

===Bayle===. 
[[Pierre Bayle]] (1647–1706) was a French Protestant scholar and philosopher who went into exile in Holland. In his "Dictionnaire historique and critique" and "Commentaire Philosophique" he advanced arguments for religious toleration (though, like some others of his time, he was not anxious to extend the same protection to Catholics he would to differing Protestant sects). Among his arguments were that every church believes it is the right one so "a heretical church would be in a position to persecute the true church". Bayle wrote that "the erroneous conscience procures for error the same rights and privileges that the orthodox conscience procures for truth."<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bayle "Pierre Bayle"], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, updated August 19, 2008. Accessed March 6, 2011</ref> . 

Bayle was repelled by the use of scripture to justify coercion and violence: "One must transcribe almost the whole New Testament to collect all the Proofs it affords us of that Gentleness and Long-suffering, which constitute the distinguishing and essential Character of the Gospel." He did not regard toleration as a danger to the state, but to the contrary: "If the Multiplicity of Religions prejudices the State, it proceeds from their not bearing with one another but on the contrary endeavoring each to crush and destroy the other by methods of Persecution. In a word, all the Mischief arises not from Toleration, but from the want of it."<ref>Joseph LoConte, [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/thepastinthepresent/historymatters/goldenrule.html "The Golden Rule of Toleration"]. Accessed March 6, 2011</ref> . 

===Act of Toleration===. 
The [[Act of Toleration 1689|Act of Toleration]], adopted by the British Parliament in 1689, allowed freedom of worship to Nonconformists who had pledged to the oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy and rejected transubstantiation The Nonconformists were Protestants who dissented from the Church of England such as Baptists and Congregationalists. They were allowed their own places of worship and their own teachers, if they accepted certain oaths of allegiance.  . 

The Act did not apply to Catholics and non-trinitarians and continued the existing social and political disabilities for Dissenters, including their exclusion from political office and also from universities.  . 

===Voltaire===. 
François-Marie Arouet, the French writer, historian and philosopher known as [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778) published his "Treatise on Toleration" in 1763. In it he attacked religious views, but also said, "It does not require great art, or magnificently trained eloquence, to prove that Christians should tolerate each other. I, however, am going further: I say that we should regard all men as our brothers. What? The Turk my brother? The Chinaman my brother? The Jew? The Siam? Yes, without doubt; are we not all children of the same father and creatures of the same God?"<ref>Voltaire [http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~wldciv/world_civ_reader/world_civ_reader_2/voltaire.html ''A Treatise on Toleration''] (1763)</ref> On the other hand, Voltaire in his writings on religion was spiteful and intolerant of the practice of the Christian religion, and rabbi [[Joseph Telushkin]] has claimed that the most significant of Enlightenment hostility against Judaism was found in Voltaire. <ref name="Why?">[[Dennis Prager|Prager, D]]; [[Joseph Telushkin|Telushkin, J]].

===Lessing===. 
[[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] (1729–1781), German dramatist and philosopher, trusted in a "Christianity of Reason", in which human reason (initiated by criticism and dissent) would develop, even without help by divine revelation. His plays about Jewish characters and themes, such as "Die Juden" and "[[Nathan the Wise|Nathan der Weise]]", "have usually been considered impressive pleas for social and religious toleration". <ref>{{cite journal|author=R.

===Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen===. 
The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]] (1789), adopted by the [[National Constituent Assembly]] during the [[French Revolution]], states in Article 10: "No-one shall be interfered with for his opinions, even religious ones, provided that their practice doesn't disturb public order as established by the law." ("Nul ne doit être inquiété pour ses opinions, mêmes religieuses, pourvu que leur manifestation ne trouble pas l'ordre public établi par la loi.")<ref>[http://www.textes.justice.gouv.fr/textes-fondamentaux-10086/droits-de-lhomme-et-libertes-fondamentales-10087/declaration-des-droits-de-lhomme-et-du-citoyen-de-1789-10116.html "Déclaration des droits de l'Homme et du citoyen de 1789"].

===The First Amendment to the United States Constitution===. 
The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], ratified along with the rest of the [[Bill of Rights]] on December 15, 1791, included the following words:"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof..." . 

In 1802, Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to the [[Danbury Baptists]] Association in which he said:
"...I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of separation between Church & State."<ref>[http://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9806/danpre.html Jefferson's Letter to the Danbury Baptists (June 1998) – Library of Congress Information Bulletin].

==In the nineteenth century==. 
The process of legislating religious toleration went forward, while philosophers continued to discuss the underlying rationale.  . 

===Catholic Relief Act===. 
The [[Catholic Relief Act]] adopted by the Parliament in 1829 repealed the last of the criminal laws aimed at Catholic citizens of Great Britain.  . 

===Mill===. 
[[John Stuart Mill]]'s arguments in "[[On Liberty]]" (1859) in support of the freedom of speech were phrased to include a defense of religious toleration:
<blockquote> Let the opinions impugned be the belief of God and in a future state, or any of the commonly received doctrines of morality... But I must be permitted to observe that it is not the feeling sure of a doctrine (be it what it may) which I call an assumption of infallibility. It is the undertaking to decide that question ''for others'', without allowing them to hear what can be said on the contrary side. And I denounce and reprobate this pretension not the less if it is put forth on the side of my most solemn convictions. <ref>John Stuart Mill (1806–1873) “On Liberty” 1859. ed. Gertrude Himmelfarb, UK: Penguin, 1985, pp.83–84</ref></blockquote> . 

===Renan===. 
In his 1882 essay "[[What is a Nation?]]", French historian and philosopher [[Ernst Renan]] proposed a definition of nationhood based on "a spiritual principle" involving shared memories, rather than a common religious, racial or linguistic heritage. Thus members of any religious group could participate fully in the life of the nation. ""You can be French, English, German, yet Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, or practicing no religion". <ref>Ernst Renan, [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Qu%E2%80%99est-ce_qu%E2%80%99une_nation_%3F "Qu'est-ce qu'une nation?"], conference faite en Sorbonne, le 11 Mars 1882. Accessed January 13, 2011</ref> . 

==In the twentieth century==. 
In 1948, the [[United Nations]] General Assembly adopted Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], which states:
<blockquote> Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance<ref>[http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html "The Universal Declaration of Human Rights"], United Nations 1948, retrieved 1 June 2007. </ref></blockquote>
Even though not formally legally binding, the Declaration has been adopted in or influenced many national constitutions since 1948. It also serves as the foundation for a growing number of international treaties and national laws and international, regional, national and sub-national institutions protecting and promoting human rights including the [[freedom of religion]].  . 

In 1965, The Roman Catholic Church [[Vatican II]] Council issued the decree [[Dignitatis Humanae]] (Religious Freedom) that states that all people must have the right to religious freedom. <ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651207_dignitatis-humanae_en.html "Dignitatis Humanae"], Decree on Religious Freedom, 1965, retrieved 1 June 2007. </ref> . 

In 1986, the first [[Day of Prayer|World Day of Prayer for Peace]] was held in Assisi. Representatives of one hundred and twenty different religions came together for prayer to their God or gods. <ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/1986/october/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_19861027_prayer-peace-assisi-final_en.html "ADDRESS OF JOHN PAUL II TO THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCHES AND ECCLESIAL COMMUNITIES AND OF THE WORLD RELIGIONS"] (1986) retrieved 1 June 2007. </ref> . 

In 1988, in the spirit of [[Glasnost]], Soviet premier [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] promised increased religious toleration. <ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109504/Russia "Russia"], Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved on 2011-06-15. </ref> . 

==In other religions==. 
Other major world religions also have texts or practices supporting the idea of religious toleration.  . 

===Islam===. 
Circa 622, [[Muhammed]] established the [[Constitution of Medina]], which incorporated religious freedom for Christians and Jews.  . 

Certain verses of the [[Qu'ran]] were interpreted to create a specially tolerated status for [[People of the Book]], Jewish and Christian believers in the Old and New Testaments considered to have been a basis for Islamic religion:
<blockquote>''Verily! Those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in God and the Last Day and do righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve .'' <ref>Quran 2:62</ref></blockquote>
Under [[Sharia|Islamic law]], Jews and Christians were considered [[dhimmi]]s, a legal status inferior to that of a Muslim but superior to that of other non-Muslims.  . 

[[History of the Jews in Turkey#Ottoman era|Jewish communities in the Ottoman Empire]] held a protected status and continued to practice their own religion, as did Christians. Yitzhak Sarfati, born in Germany, became the Chief Rabbi of [[Edirne]] and wrote a letter inviting European Jews to settle in the [[Ottoman Empire]], in which he asked:: "''Is it not better for you to live under Muslims than under Christians?''". <ref>[[Bernard Lewis|B. Lewis]], "The Jews of Islam", New York (1984), pp. 135 – 136</ref> Sultan [[Beyazid II]] (1481–1512), issued a formal invitation to the Jews expelled from Catholic Spain and Portugal, leading to a wave of Jewish immigration.  . 

According to Michael Walzer:
<blockquote>The established religion of the [Ottoman] empire was Islam, but three other religious communities—Greek Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox, and Jewish—were permitted to form autonomous organizations. These three were equal among themselves, without regard to their relative numerical strength. They were subject to the same restrictions vis -a-vis Muslims—with regard to dress, proselytizing, and intermarriage, for example—and were allowed the same legal control over their own members. <ref>Michael Walzer, ''On Toleration'' (New Haven: Yale UNiversity Press 1997) ISNB 0300076002 p. 17</ref></blockquote> . 

Modern Islamic exegetics considers Qur'an as the source of religious tolerance <ref>Mykhaylo Yakubovych, ''A Cultural Significance of the Modern Islamic Exegetics for the Theory of Religious Tolerance''</ref>http://salam.org.ua/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Tafsir.pdf</ref> . 

===Hindu religion===. 
The [[Rigveda]] says ''Ekam Sath Viprah Bahudha Vadanti'' which translates to "The truth is One, but sages call it by different Names". <ref>[http://www.religioustolerance.org/hinduism2.htm "Hinduism – a general introduction"]</ref> Consistent with this tradition, [[India]] chose to be a secular country even though it was created after [[Partition of India|partitioning]] on religious lines.  . 

===Buddhism=== . 

Although the [[Buddh]]a preached that "the path to the supreme goal of the holy life is made known only in his own teaching", according to Bhikkhu Boddhi, Buddhists have nevertheless shown significant tolerance for other religions: "Buddhist tolerance springs from the recognition that the dispositions and spiritual needs of human beings are too vastly diverse to be encompassed by any single teaching, and thus that these needs will naturally find expression in a wide variety of religious forms." <ref>Bhikkhu Bodhi, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/bps-essay_24.html "Tolerance and Diversity"]. ''Access to Insight'', 5 June 2010. Accessed March 6, 2011</ref> [[James Freeman Clarke]] said in ''Ten Great Religions'' (1871): "The Buddhists have founded no Inquisition; they have combined the zeal which converted kingdoms with a toleration almost inexplicable to our Western experience." <ref>Tweed, Thomas, ''The American Encounter with Buddhism, 1844–1912'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press 2000) p. 101 ISBN 0807849065</ref> . 

The [[Edicts of Ashoka]] issued by King [[Ashoka the Great]] (269 – 231 BCE), a Buddhist, declared ethnic and religious tolerance. His Edict XII, engraved in stone, stated: "The faiths of others all deserve to be honored for one reason or another. By honoring them, one exalts one's own faith and at the same time performs a service to the faith of others."<ref>Kristin Scheible, "Towards a Buddhist Policy of Tolerance: the case of King Ashoka" in Neusner, Jacob, ed. ''Religious Tolerance in World Religions'' (West Conshohocken, PA, Templeton Foundation Prsss 2008) p. 323</ref> . 

==Modern analyses and critiques of toleration== . 

Contemporary commentators have highlighted situations in which toleration conflicts with widely held moral standards, national law, the principles of national identity, or other strongly held goals. Michael Walzer notes that the British in India tolerated the Hindu practice of [[suttee]] (ritual burning of a widow) until 1829. On the other hand, the United States declined to tolerate the [[Mormon]] practice of [[polygamy]]. <ref>Michael Walzer, ''On Toleration'', (New Haven: Yale University Press 1997) p. 61 ISBN 0300076002</ref> The [[Islamic veil controversy in France|French head scarf controversy]] represents a conflict between religious practice and the French secular ideal. <ref>John Bowen, [http://bostonreview.net/BR29.1/bowen.html "Muslims and Citizens"], ''The Boston Review'' February–March 2004. Accessed January 25, 2011</ref> Toleration of the [[Romani people|Romani]] people in European countries is a continuing issue. <ref>[http://www.economist.com/node/17043366 "Romanies: A long road"], ''The Economist'' September 16, 2010. Accessed March 22, 2011</ref> . 

===Modern definition===. 
Historian Alexandra Walsham notes that the modern understanding of the word "toleration" may be very different from its historic meaning. <ref name="Walsham06-233">Alexandra Walsham, ''Charitable Hatred: Tolerance and Intolerance in England, 1500–1700''. Manchester University Press (2006) ISBN 0719052394 p. 233. </ref> Toleration in modern parlance has been analyzed as a component of a liberal or [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] view of [[human rights]]. Hans Oberdiek writes, "As long as no one is harmed or no one's fundamental rights are violated, the state should keep hands off, tolerating what those controlling the state find disgusting, deplorable or even debased. This for a long time has been the most prevalent defense of toleration by liberals...It is found, for example, in the writings of American philosophers [[John Rawls]], [[Robert Nozick]], [[Ronald Dworkin]], [[Brian Barry]], and a Canadian, [[Will Kymlicka]], among others."<ref>Oberdiek, Hans, ''Tolerance: between forebearance and acceptance'' (Lanham, Maryland: Rowman and Littlefield, 2001) p. vi ISBN 0847687856</ref> . 

[[John Rawls]]' "theory of 'political liberalism' conceives of toleration as a pragmatic response to the fact of diversity." Diverse groups learn to tolerate one another by developing "what Rawls calls 'overlapping consensus': individuals and groups with diverse metaphysical views or 'comprehensive schemes' will find reasons to agree about certain principles of justice that will include principles of toleration."<ref>[http://www.iep.utm.edu/tolerati/ "Toleration"], ''The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Accessed March 21, 2011</ref> . 

[[Herbert Marcuse]] wrote "''[[Repressive Tolerance]]''" in 1965 where he argued that the "''pure tolerance''" that permits all favors totalitaliam democraty and tyranny of [[majority]], and insisted the "''repressive tolerance''" against them.  . 

===Toleration of homosexuality===. 
As a result of his public debate with [[Baron Devlin]] on the role of the criminal law in enforcing moral norms, British legal philosopher [[H.L.A. Hart]] wrote ''Law, Liberty and Morality'' (1963) and ''The Morality of the Criminal Law'' (1965). His work on the relationship between law and morality had a significant effect on the laws of Great Britain, helping bring about the decriminalization of homosexuality. But it was [[Jeremy Bentham]] that defended the rights for homosexuality with his essay "Offence against One's Self"<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/eresources/exhibitions/sw25/bentham/index.html Offence against One's Self]</ref> but could not be published until in 1978.  . 

===Tolerating the intolerant===. 
Walzer asks "Should we tolerate the intolerant?" He notes that most minority religious groups who are the beneficiaries of tolerance are themselves intolerant, at least in some respects. In a tolerant regime, such people may learn to tolerate, or at least to behave "as if they possessed this virtue". <ref>Michael Walzer, ''On Toleration'', (New Haven: Yale University Press 1997) p. 80-81 ISBN 0300076002</ref> Philosopher [[Karl Popper]] asserted, in ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' Vol. 1, that we are warranted in refusing to tolerate intolerance. Philosopher [[John Rawls]] concludes in ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' that a just society must tolerate the intolerant, for otherwise, the society would then itself be intolerant, and thus unjust. However, Rawls also insists, like Popper, that society has a reasonable right of self-preservation that supersedes the principle of tolerance: "While an intolerant sect does not itself have title to complain of intolerance, its freedom should be restricted only when the tolerant sincerely and with reason believe that their own security and that of the institutions of liberty are in danger."<ref name=Rawls1921>{{Cite journal

===Other criticisms and issues===. 
Toleration has been described as undermining itself via [[moral relativism]]: "either the claim self-referentially undermines itself or it provides us with no compelling reason to believe it. If we are skeptical about knowledge, then we have no way of knowing that toleration is good."<ref>[http://www.iep.utm.edu/tolerati/#H5 "Toleration"], ''The Internet encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Accessed March 21, 2011</ref> . 

[[Ronald Dworkin]] argues that in exchange for toleration, minorities must bear with the criticisms and insults which are part of the freedom of speech in an otherwise tolerant society. <ref>Ronald Dworkin, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/feb/14/muhammadcartoons.comment "Even bigots and Holocaust deniers must have their say"], ''The Guardian'', February 14, 2006. retrieved March 21, 2011</ref> Dworkin has also questioned whether the United States is a "tolerant secular" nation, or is re-characterizing itself as a "tolerant religious" nation, based on the increasing re-introduction of religious themes into conservative politics. Dworkin concludes that "the tolerant secular model is preferable, although he invited people to use the concept of personal responsibility to argue in favor of the tolerant religious model."<ref>[http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/news/2006_spr/dworkin.htm "Dworkin Explores Secular, Religious Models for Society"], ''Virginia Law School News and Events'', April 18, 2008. accessed March 21, 2011</ref> . 

In ''[[The End of Faith]]'', [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] asserts that we should be unwilling to tolerate unjustified religious beliefs about morality, spirituality, politics, and the origin of humanity, especially beliefs which promote violence.  .
