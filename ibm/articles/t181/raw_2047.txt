{{The Holocaust}}
{{Antisemitism}} . 

'''The Holocaust''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|ὁλόκαυστος}} ''{{lang|el-Latn|holókaustos}}'': ''hólos'', "whole" and ''kaustós'', "burnt"),<ref>The word is only marginally found in Greek [Classical] literature referring in general to an ''offering''. The adjective ὁλόκαυστος "holókaustos], "wholly burned", more common in the parallel form ὁλόκαυτος [holókautos], is in the [[Septuagint|Greek version of the Hebrew Bible]] used in [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] 6,21–22 in the following context: "[...] the baked pieces of the grain offering you shall offer for a sweet aroma to the Lord. / The priest [...] shall offer it. It is a [[Statute#Biblical terminology|statute]] for ever to the Lord. It shall be ''wholly burned'')."</ref> also known as '''the Shoah''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: <big>{{lang|he|השואה}}</big>, ''HaShoah'', "catastrophe"; [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]: <big>{{lang|yi|חורבן}}</big>, ''Churben'' or ''Hurban'',<ref name=Britannica>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/269548/Holocaust "Holocaust," ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', 2009]: "the systematic state-sponsored killing of six million Jewish men, women and children, and millions of others by Nazi Germany and its collaborators during World War II. The Nazis called this "the final solution to the Jewish question ..."</ref> from the Hebrew for "destruction"), was the [[genocide]] of approximately six million European [[Jews]] during [[World War II]], a programme of systematic state-sponsored [[murder]] by [[Nazi Germany]], led by [[Adolf Hitler]], throughout Nazi-occupied territory. <ref name=Niewyk1>Niewyk, Donald L.

Some scholars maintain that the definition of the Holocaust should also include the Nazis' genocide of millions of people in other groups, including [[Porajmos|Romani]], [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs|Soviet prisoners of war]], [[Nazi crimes against ethnic Poles|Polish]] and [[Generalplan Ost|Soviet]] civilians, [[Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust|homosexuals]], [[Aktion T4|people with disabilities]], [[Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in Nazi Germany|Jehovah's Witnesses]] and other [[Holocaust victims|political and religious opponents]], which occurred regardless of whether they were of [[Germans|German]] or non-German [[ethnic group|ethnic origin]]. <ref name=Niewyk45/> Using this definition, the total number of [[Holocaust victims]] is between 11 million and 17 million people. <ref>Donald Niewyk suggests that the broadest definition, including Soviet civilian deaths, would produce a death toll of 17 million. [http://books.google.ca/books?id=lpDTIUklB2MC&pg=PP1&dq=Niewyk,+Donald+L.+The+Columbia+Guide+to+the+Holocaust&sig=4igufxQHRCNrkjwRuMt1if_mf5M#PPA45,M1 Google Books] Estimates of the death toll of non-Jewish victims vary by millions, partly because the boundary between death by persecution and death by starvation and other means in a context of [[total war]] is unclear. Overall, about 5.7 million (78 percent) of the 7.3 million Jews in occupied Europe perished ([[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, Martin]]. ''Atlas of the Holocaust'' 1988, pp. 242–244). This was in contrast to the five to 11 million (1.4 percent to 3.0 percent) of the 360 million non-Jews in German-dominated Europe. Small, Melvin and J. David Singer. ''Resort to Arms: International and civil Wars 1816–1980'' and [[Michael Berenbaum|Berenbaum, Michael.]] ''A Mosaic of Victims: Non-Jews Persecuted and Murdered by the Nazis'', New York: New York University Press, 1990</ref> . 

The persecution and genocide were carried out in stages. Various [[legislation]] to remove the Jews from civil society, predominantly the [[Nuremberg Laws]], was enacted in Nazi Germany years before the outbreak of World War II. [[Nazi concentration camps|Concentration camp]]s were established in which inmates were used as slave labor until they died of exhaustion or disease. Where the [[Third Reich]] conquered new territory in eastern Europe, specialized units called ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' murdered Jews and political opponents in mass shootings. The Third Reich required Jews and Romani to be confined in overcrowded [[Ghettos in German-occupied Europe (1939–1944)|ghettos]] before being transported by freight train to [[extermination camp]]s where, if they survived the journey, the majority of them were systematically killed in [[Gas chamber#Nazi Germany|gas chambers]].  . 

Every arm of Nazi Germany's [[bureaucracy]] was involved in the [[logistics]] that led to the genocides, turning the Third Reich into what one Holocaust scholar has called "a genocidal state". <ref name=Berenbaum103>Berenbaum, Michael. ''"The World Must Know", United States Holocaust Museum'', 2006, p. 103. </ref> Opinions differ on how much the civilian [[population]] of Germany knew about the government conspiracy against the Jewish population. Most historians claim that the civilian population was unaware of the atrocities that were carried out, especially in the extermination camps, which were located outside of Germany in [[Nazi-occupied Europe]]. The historian [[Robert Gellately]], however, claims that the government openly announced the conspiracy through the media, and that civilians were aware of its every aspect except for the use of gas chambers. <ref>{{cite news|title=Germans knew of Holocaust horror about death camps|author=[[John Ezard]]|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=February 17, 2001|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2001/feb/17/johnezard|accessdate=|location=London}}</ref> Significant historical evidence points to the idea that the vast majority of Holocaust victims, prior to their deportation to concentration camps, were either unaware of the fate that awaited them, or were in disbelief; they honestly believed that they were to be resettled. <ref name=resettled>See Leni Yahil, Ina Friedman, Haya Galai, ''The Holocaust: the fate of European Jewry, 1932-1945'', Oxford University Press, 1991, p. 257; Donald L.

==Etymology and use of the term==. 
{{main|Names of the Holocaust}}
The term ''holocaust'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''[[Holocaust (sacrifice)|holókauston]]'', an [[animal sacrifice]] offered to a god in which the whole (''holos'') animal is completely burnt (''kaustos''). <ref>The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia, vol.4, p.2859</ref> For hundreds of years, the word "holocaust" was used in English to denote great massacres, but since the 1960s, the term has come to be used by scholars and popular writers to refer exclusively to the genocide of Jews. <ref name=Niewyk1>{{cite book|last=Niewyk|first=Donald L.|title=The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2000|page=45}}</ref> The mini-series [[Holocaust (TV miniseries)|''Holocaust'']] is credited with introducing the term into common parlance after 1978. <ref name="Steinweis">Alan Steinweis provides a survey of this phenomenon in {{Cite journal | last1 = Steinweis | first1 = Alan E.| title = The Holocaust and American Culture: An Assessment of Recent Scholarship | doi = 10.1093/hgs/15.2.296 | journal = Holocaust and Genocide Studies | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 296–310 | year = 2001}}</ref> . 

The [[Bible|biblical]] word '''''Shoah''''' (שואה) (also spelled '''''Sho'ah''''' and '''''Shoa'''''), meaning "calamity", became the standard [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term for the Holocaust as early as the 1940s, especially in Europe and Israel. <ref name=yad1>"[http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/resource_center/the_holocaust.asp "The Holocaust: Definition and Preliminary Discussion"], [[Yad Vashem]]. Retrieved June 8, 2005. </ref> ''Shoah'' is preferred by many Jews for a number of reasons, including the [[Theology|theologically]] offensive nature of the word "holocaust", which they take to refer to the Greek pagan custom. <ref>For an opposing view on the allegedly offensive nature of the meaning of the word "holocaust", see Petrie, Jon. "The Secular Word 'HOLOCAUST': Scholarly Myths, History, and Twentieth Century Meanings", ''Journal of Genocide Research'' Vol. 2, no. 1 (2000): 31–63. (For a web version of this article see [http://www.berkeleyinternet.com/holocaust] )</ref> . 

The Nazis used a [[euphemism|euphemistic]] phrase, the "[[Final Solution]] to the Jewish Question" (German: ''Endlösung der Judenfrage''), and the phrase "Final Solution" has been widely used as a term for the genocide of the Jews subsequently. Nazis also used the phrase “Leben unwertes Leben” ([[Life unworthy of life]]) in an attempt to justify the killings philosophically.  . 

==Distinctive features==. 
===Institutional collaboration===. 
[[File:WW2-Holocaust-Europe.png|thumb|350px|[[Ghettos]] were established in Europe in which Jews were confined before being shipped to extermination camps.]]
[[Michael Berenbaum]] writes that Germany became a "genocidal state."<ref name=Berenbaum103/> "Every arm of the country's sophisticated bureaucracy was involved in the killing process. Parish churches and the Interior Ministry supplied birth records showing who was Jewish; the Post Office delivered the [[deportation]] and [[denaturalization]] orders; the Finance Ministry confiscated Jewish property; German firms fired Jewish workers and disenfranchised Jewish stockholders." The universities refused to admit Jews, denied degrees to those already studying, and fired Jewish academics; government transport offices arranged the trains for deportation to the camps; German [[pharmaceutical]] companies tested drugs on camp prisoners; companies bid for the contracts to build the [[crematoria]]; detailed lists of victims were drawn up using the [[Dehomag]] (IBM Germany) company's [[Punched card|punch card]] machines, producing meticulous records of the killings. As prisoners entered the death camps, they were made to surrender all personal property, which was carefully catalogued and tagged before being sent to Germany to be reused or recycled. Berenbaum writes that the Final Solution of the Jewish question was "in the eyes of the perpetrators ... Germany's greatest achievement."<ref name=Berenbaum104>Berenbaum, Michael. ''The World Must Know", United States Holocaust Museum'', 2006, p. 104. </ref> . 

[[Saul Friedländer]] writes that: "Not one social group, not one religious community, not one scholarly institution or professional association in Germany and throughout Europe declared its solidarity with the Jews."<ref name=Friedxxi>{{cite book|author=[[Saul Friedländer|Friedländer, Saul]]|title=Nazi Germany and the Jews: The Years of Extermination|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|year=2007|pages=xxi|isbn=0-06-019043-4|oclc=|doi=}}</ref> He writes that some Christian churches declared that ''converted'' Jews should be regarded as part of the flock, but even then only up to a point.  . 

Friedländer argues that this makes the Holocaust distinctive because antisemitic policies were able to unfold without the interference of countervailing forces of the kind normally found in advanced societies, such as industry, small businesses, churches, and other vested interests and [[lobbying|lobby]] groups. <ref name=Friedxxi/> . 

===Ideology and scale===. 
In other genocides, pragmatic considerations such as control of territory and resources were central to the genocide policy. [[Yehuda Bauer]] argues that: . 

{{Quotation|The basic motivation [of the Holocaust] was purely ideological, rooted in an illusionary world of Nazi imagination, where an international Jewish [[Cabal|conspiracy]] to control the world was opposed to a parallel [[Aryan]] quest. No genocide to date had been based so completely on [[myth]]s, on [[hallucination]]s, on abstract, nonpragmatic ideology{{spaced ndash}}which was then executed by very rational, pragmatic means."<ref name=BauerRethinking48>{{cite book|author=Bauer, Yehuda|title=Rethinking the Holocaust|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn|year=2002|page=48|isbn=0-300-09300-4|oclc=|doi=}}</ref>}} . 

Responding to the German philosopher [[Ernst Nolte]], who claimed that the Holocaust was not unique, the German historian [[Eberhard Jäckel]] wrote in 1986 that the Holocaust was unique because: . 

{{Quotation|the National Socialist killing of the Jews was unique in that never before had a state with the authority of its responsible leader decided and announced that a specific human group, including its aged, its women and its children and infants, would be killed as quickly as possible, and then carried through this resolution using every possible means of state power. <ref>Maier, Charles ''The Unmasterable Past'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1988 page 53</ref>}} . 

The slaughter was systematically conducted in virtually all areas of [[Occupied Europe|Nazi-occupied territory]] in what are now 35 separate European countries. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://history1900s.about.com/library/holocaust/blmap.htm|title=Holocaust Map of Concentration and Death Camps|publisher=History1900s.about.com|date=June 16, 2010|accessdate=July 31, 2010}}</ref> It was at its worst in Central and Eastern Europe, which had more than seven million Jews in 1939. About five million Jews were killed there, including three million in occupied Poland and over one million in the Soviet Union. Hundreds of thousands also died in the Netherlands, France, Belgium, [[Yugoslavia]] and Greece. The [[Wannsee Conference|Wannsee Protocol]] makes it clear that the Nazis intended to carry their "final solution of the Jewish question" to Britain and all the other neutral states in Europe, such as Ireland, Switzerland, Turkey, Sweden, Portugal and Spain. <ref name=GilbertOxford>{{cite book|author=Dear, Ian|title=The Oxford companion to World War II|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2001|pages=|isbn=0-19-860446-7|oclc=|doi=}}</ref> . 

Anyone with three or four Jewish grandparents was to be exterminated without exception. In other genocides, people were able to escape death by [[religious conversion|converting]] to another religion or in some other way [[religious assimilation|assimilating]]. This option was not available to the Jews of occupied Europe,<ref name=BauerRethinking>Bauer, Yehuda. ''Rethinking the Holocaust'' New Haven: Yale UP, 2002, p. 49. For a good summary of this point, see Yehuda Bauer's [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1998/1/Address%20to%20the%20Bundestag-%20by%20Professor%20Yehuda%20Baue Address to the Bundestag]. </ref> unless their grandparents had converted before January 18, 1871. All persons of recent Jewish ancestry were to be exterminated in lands controlled by Germany. <ref name=BauerRethinking49>{{cite book|author=Bauer, Yehuda|title=Rethinking the Holocaust|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn|year=2002|page=49|isbn=0-300-09300-4|oclc=|doi=}}</ref> . 

===Extermination camps===. 
{{main|Extermination camp}}
The use of camps equipped with gas chambers for the purpose of systematic mass extermination of peoples was a unique feature of the Holocaust and unprecedented in history. Never before in history had there existed places with the express purpose of killing people en masse.  . 

===Medical experiments===. 
{{see|Nazi human experimentation}}
[[File:RomanichildrenAuschwitz.jpg|thumb|[[Romani people|Romani]] children in [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], victims of medical experiments]] . 

Another distinctive feature of the Holocaust was the extensive use of human subjects in medical experiments. German physicians carried out such experiments at [[Auschwitz]], [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], [[Buchenwald]], [[Ravensbrück]], [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]] and [[Natzweiler]] concentration camps. <ref name=Harran384>{{cite book|author=Harran, Marilyn J.|title=The Holocaust Chronicles: A History in Words and Pictures|publisher=Publications International|location=Lincolnwood, Illinois|year=2000|page=384|isbn=0-7853-2963-3|oclc=|doi=}} [http://www.holocaustchronicle.org/index.html Full text]</ref> . 

The most notorious of these physicians was Dr. [[Josef Mengele]], who worked in Auschwitz. His experiments included placing subjects in pressure chambers, testing drugs on them, freezing them, attempting to change eye color by injecting chemicals into children's eyes and various amputations and other brutal surgeries. <ref name=Harran384/> The full extent of his work will never be known because the truckload of records he sent to Dr. [[Otmar von Verschuer]] at the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] was destroyed by von Verschuer. <ref name=isbn0-87969-531-5>{{cite book|author=Müller-Hill, Benno|title=Murderous science: elimination by scientific selection of Jews, Gypsies, and others in Germany, 1933–1945|publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press|location=Plainview, N.Y|year=1998|page=22|isbn=0-87969-531-5|oclc=|doi=}}</ref> Subjects who survived Mengele's experiments were almost always killed and dissected shortly afterwards.  . 

He seemed particularly keen on working with Romani children. He would bring them sweets and toys, and personally take them to the gas chamber. They would call him "Onkel Mengele". <ref name=Berenbaum194>{{cite book|author=Berenbaum, Michael|title=The world must know: The history of the Holocaust as told in the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]|publisher=Little, Brown|location=Boston|year=1993|pages=194–5|isbn=0-316-09134-0|oclc=|doi=}}</ref> Vera Alexander was a Jewish inmate at Auschwitz who looked after 50 sets of Romani twins: . 

{{Quotation|I remember one set of twins in particular: Guido and Ina, aged about four. One day, Mengele took them away. When they returned, they were in a terrible state: they had been sewn together, back to back, like [[Siamese twins]]. Their wounds were infected and oozing pus. They screamed day and night. Then their parents{{spaced ndash}}I remember the mother's name was Stella{{spaced ndash}}managed to get some [[morphine]] and they killed the children in order to end their suffering. <ref name=Berenbaum194/>}} .

[[Yehuda Bauer]], [[Raul Hilberg]] and [[Lucy Dawidowicz]] maintained that from the Middle Ages onward, German society and culture were suffused with [[anti-Semitism]], and that there was a direct link from medieval [[pogroms]] to the [[Nazi death camps]]. <ref>Yehuda Bauer- A History of the Holocaust, 1982</ref><ref>Raul Hilberg, The Destruction of the European Jews, 1961. </ref><ref>Lucy Dawidowicz, The War Against the Jews, 1975</ref>
The second half of the 19th century saw the emergence in [[History of Germany|Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] of the so-called [[Völkisch movement|''Völkisch'' movement]], which as developed by such thinkers as [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]] and [[Paul de Lagarde]], presented a pseudo-scientific, biologically-based racism that saw Jews as a "race" locked into mortal combat with the "Aryan" race for world domination. <ref>Fischer, Conan ''The Rise of the Nazis'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002 pages 47–49. </ref> ''Völkisch'' anti-Semitism, though drawing upon stereotypes from Christian anti-Semitism, differed from the latter in that Jews were considered to be a "race" rather than a religion. <ref>Gramel, Hermann "Modern Anti-Semitism in Germany" pages 33–68 from ''Antisemitism in the Third Reich'', London: Blackwill, 1992 pages 53–54. </ref> In 1895, one of the ''völkisch'' leaders, [[Hermann Ahlwardt]], in a speech before the ''Reichstag'', called Jews "predators" and "cholera bacilli" who should be "exterminated" for the good of the German people. <ref>Gramel, Hermann "Modern Anti-Semitism in Germany" pages 33–68 from ''Antisemitism in the Third Reich'', London: Blackwill, 1992 page 61. </ref> In his best-selling 1912 book ''Wenn ich der Kaiser wär'' (''If I were the Kaiser''), [[Heinrich Class]], the leader of one of the more powerful ''völkisch'' groups, the ''[[Alldeutscher Verband]]'', urged that all German Jews be stripped of their German citizenship and be reduced to ''Fremdenrecht'' (alien status). <ref name=Friedlander76>Friedländer, Saul ''Nazi Germany and the Jews: The Years of Persecution, 1933–1939'', New York: HarperCollins, 1997 page 76</ref> Class also urged that Jews be excluded from all aspects of German life, forbidden to own land, hold public office, or participate in journalism, banking, and the liberal professions. <ref name=Friedlander76/> Class defined a Jew as anyone, regardless of their religion, whose grandparents or parents were Jews in 1871. <ref name=Friedlander76/> The British historian of modern Germany [[Richard J. Evans]] wrote that during the Imperial period in German history, ''völkisch'' and scientific racist ideas had become very common and accepted in many quarters in Germany. <ref>Evans, Richard J. ''In Hitler's Shadow'', New York: Pantheon, 1989 page 69. </ref> Though the ''völkisch'' parties suffered a crushing defeat in the 1912 ''Reichstag'' elections, being all but wiped out, this had less to do with the unpopularity of their anti-Semitism than the way the mainstream German parties had incorporated it into their own platforms—which helps to explain why Nazi anti-Semitism created so little opposition during the Weimar Republic. <ref>Evans, Richard J. ''In Hitler's Shadow: West German Historians and the Attempt to Escape the Nazi Past'', New York: Pantheon, 1989 page 69. </ref> The National Socialist German Workers' Party was founded in 1919 as an offshoot of the ''völkisch'' movement, and adopted their anti-Semitism. <ref>Fischer, Conan ''The Rise of the Nazis'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002 pages 47–51. </ref> In a 1986 essay, the German historian [[Hans Mommsen]] wrote about the situation in post–World War I Germany that:{{Quotation|If one emphasizes the indisputably important connection in isolation, one should not then force a connection with Hitler's ''weltanschauung'' [worldview], which was in no ways original itself, in order to deprive from it the existence of Auschwitz&nbsp;... Thoughts about the extermination of the Jews had long been current, and not only for Hitler and his satraps. Many of these found their way to the NSDAP from the [[Deutschvölkischer Schutz und Trutzbund|''Deutschvölkisch Schutz-und Trutzbund'']] [German Racial Union for Protection and Defiance], which itself had been called into life by the [[Alldeutscher Verband|Pan-German Union]]. <ref>Mommsen, Hans "The New Historical Consciousness" pages 114–124 from ''Forever In The Shadow of Hitler?'' edited by Ernst Piper, Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, 1993 page 121</ref>}} . 

The tremendous scientific and technological changes in Germany of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, together with the growth of the welfare state, created widespread hopes that "[[utopia]]" was at hand and that soon all social problems could be solved. <ref>Peukert, Detlev "The Genesis of the 'Final Solution' from the Spirit of Science" pages 274–299 from ''Nazism and German Society, 1933–1945'' edited by David F. Crew, London: Routledge, 1994 pages 280–284</ref> At the same time, owing to the great prestige of science, a scientific racist, social Darwinist and eugenicist world-view which declared some people to be more biologically "valuable" than others was common amongst German elites. <ref>Peukert, Detlev "The Genesis of the 'Final Solution' from the Spirit of Science" pages 274–299 from ''Nazism and German Society, 1933–1945'' edited by David F. Crew, London: Routledge, 1994 pages 279–280</ref> The historian [[Detlev Peukert]] in his 1989 essay "The Genesis of the 'Final Solution' from the Spirit of Science" declared that the ''Shoah'' was not the result solely of anti-Semitism, but was instead a product of the "cumulative radicalization" in which "numerous smaller currents" fed into the "broad current" that led to genocide. <ref>Peukert, Detlev "The Genesis of the 'Final Solution' from the Spirit of Science" pages 274–299 from ''Nazism and German Society, 1933–1945'' edited by David F. Crew, London: Routledge, 1994 page 280</ref> After the First World War, the pre-war mood of optimism gave way to disillusionment as German bureaucrats found social problems to be more insoluble than previously thought, which in turn led them to place increasing emphasis on saving the biologically "fit" while the biologically "unfit" were to be written off. <ref>Peukert, Detlev "The Genesis of the 'Final Solution' from the Spirit of Science" pages 274–299 from ''Nazism and German Society, 1933–1945'' edited by David F. Crew, London: Routledge, 1994 page 288</ref> The economic strains caused by the Great Depression had led to many in the German medical establishment to advocate with increasing vigor the idea of selective killings of the "incurable" mentally and physically disabled as a cost-saving measure in order to free up money to care for the curable. <ref>Burleigh, Michael "Psychiatry, Society and Nazi "Euthanasia" pages 43–62 from The Holocaust: Origins, Implementation, Aftermath edited by Omer Bartov, London: Routledge, 2000, pages 47–48. </ref> Thus by the time the Nazis had come to power in 1933, a huge boost was given to the already existing tendency in German social policy to save the racially "valuable" while seeking to rid society of the racially "undesirable". <ref>Peukert, Detlev "The Genesis of the 'Final Solution' from the Spirit of Science" pages 274–299 from ''Nazism and German Society, 1933–1945'' edited by David F. Crew, London: Routledge, 1994 page 289</ref> . 

The persecution and exodus of Germany's 525,000 Jews began almost as soon as the Nazis came to power on January 30, 1933. In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Hitler had been open about his hatred of Jews, and gave ample warning of his intention to drive them from Germany's political, intellectual, and cultural life. He did not write that he would attempt to exterminate them, but he is reported to have been more explicit in private. As early as 1922, he allegedly told Major Joseph Hell, at the time a journalist: . 

{{Quotation|Once I really am in power, my first and foremost task will be the annihilation of the Jews. As soon as I have the power to do so, I will have gallows built in rows{{spaced ndash}}at the Marienplatz in [[Munich]], for example{{spaced ndash}}as many as traffic allows. Then the Jews will be hanged indiscriminately, and they will remain hanging until they stink; they will hang there as long as the principles of hygiene permit. As soon as they have been untied, the next batch will be strung up, and so on down the line, until the last Jew in Munich has been exterminated. Other cities will follow suit, precisely in this fashion, until all Germany has been completely cleansed of Jews. <ref>Hell, Josef.

The German historian [[Hans Mommsen]] claimed that there were three types of anti-Semitism in Germany: {{Quotation|One should differentiate between the cultural antisemitism symptomatic of the German conservatives — found especially in the German officer corps and the high civil administration — and mainly directed against the Eastern Jews on the one hand, and ''völkisch'' antisemitism on the other. The conservative variety functions, as Shulamit Volkov has pointed out, as something of a "cultural code." This variety of German antisemitism later on played a significant role insofar as it prevented the functional elite from distancing itself from the repercussions of racial antisemitism. Thus, there was almost no relevant protest against the Jewish persecution on the part of the generals or the leading groups within the ''Reich'' government. This is especially true with respect to Hitler's proclamation of the "racial annihilation war" against the Soviet Union. <br><br>Besides conservative antisemitism, there existed in Germany a rather silent anti-Judaism within the Catholic Church, which had a certain impact on immunising the Catholic population against the escalating persecution. The famous protest of the Catholic Church against the euthanasia program was, therefore, not accompanied by any protest against the Holocaust. <br><br>The third and most vitriolic variety of antisemitism in Germany (and elsewhere) is the so-called ''völkisch'' antisemitism or racism, and this is the foremost advocate of using violence. Anyhow, one has to be aware that even Hitler until 1938 and possibly 1939 still relied on enforced emigration to get rid of German Jewry; and there did not yet exist any clear-cut concept of killing them. This, however, does not mean that the Nazis elsewhere on all levels did not hesitate to use violent methods, and the inroads against Jews, Jewish shops, and institutions show that very clearly. But there did not exist any formal annihilation program until the second year of the war. It came into being after the "reservation" projects had failed. That, however, does not mean that those methods did not include a lethal component. <ref>{{cite web|last=Mommsen|first=Hans|title=Interview with Hans Mommsen|publisher=Yad Vashem|month=December 12|year=1997|url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%203850.pdf|accessdate=February 6, 2010}}</ref>}} . 

===Legal repression and emigration===. 
{{see|Anti-Jewish legislation in prewar Nazi Germany|Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nuremberg Laws|Haavara Agreement}}
Right from the beginning of the Third Reich, Nazi leaders had proclaimed the existence of a ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'' (People's Community). Nazi policies divided the population into two categories, the ''Volksgenossen'' ("National Comrades") who belonged to the ''Volksgemeinschaft'' and the ''Gemeinschaftsfremde'' ("Community Aliens") who did not. Nazi policies about repression divided into three types of enemies, the "racial" enemies such as the Jews and the Gypsies who were viewed as enemies because of their "blood"; political opponents such as Marxists, liberals, Christians and the "reactionaries" who were viewed as wayward "National Comrades"; and moral opponents such as homosexuals, the "work-shy" and habitual criminals, also seen as wayward "National Comrades". <ref name=Noakes499>Noakes, Jeremy & Pridham, Geoffrey ''Nazism: A History in Documents and Eyewitness Accounts, 1919–1945'', Schocken Books, 1983 page 499</ref> The last two groups were to be sent to concentration camps for "re-education", with the aim of eventual absorption into the ''Volksgemeinschaft'', though some of the moral opponents were to be sterilized as they were regarded as "genetically inferior"."<ref name=Noakes499/> Racial" enemies such as the Jews could, by definition, never belong to the ''Volksgemeinschaft'', thus requiring their total removal from society. <ref name=Noakes499/> The German historian [[Detlev Peukert]] wrote that the National Socialists' "goal was an utopian ''Volksgemeinschaft'', totally under police surveillance, in which any attempt at nonconformist behaviour, or even any hint or intention of such behaviour, would be visited with terror". <ref>Peukert, Detlev ''Inside Nazi Germany: Conformity, Opposition and Racism In Everyday Life'', London: Batsford, 1987 page 220. </ref> In support of this, Peukert quoted policy documents on the "Treatment of Community Aliens" from 1944, which (though never implemented) showed the full intentions of Nazi social policy: "persons who ... show themselves [to be] unable to comply by their own efforts with the minimum requirements of the national community" were to be placed under police supervision, and if this did not reform them, they were to be taken to a concentration camp. <ref>Peukert, Detlev ''Inside Nazi Germany: Conformity, Opposition and Racism In Everyday Life'', London: Batsford, 1987 page 221. </ref>

Leading up to the March 1933 ''Reichstag'' elections, the Nazis intensified their campaign of violence against the opposition. With the co-operation of local authorities, they set up concentration camps for extrajudicial imprisonment of their opponents. One of the first was [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], which opened in March 1933. These early camps were meant for political prisoners only, such as Communists and Social Democrats, and were not killing centres like the latter death camps. <ref name=CampTimeline>{{cite web|url=http://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/timeline/camps.htm|title=Holocaust Timeline: The Camps|work=A Teacher's Guide to the Holocaust|publisher=University of South Florida|accessdate=January 6, 2007}}</ref> Other early prisons{{spaced ndash}}for example, basements and storehouses run by the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] and less commonly by [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] {{ndash}} were consolidated by mid-1934 into purpose-built camps outside the cities, exclusively run by the SS. The main purposes of the concentration camps was to serve as a deterrent by terrorizing those Germans who were unable or unwilling to join the ''Volksgemeinschaft'' in conformity<ref name="autogenerated214">Peukert, Detlev ''Inside Nazi Germany: Conformity, Opposition and Racism In Everyday Life'', London: Batsford, 1987 page 214. </ref> Those sent to the concentration camps were in turn divided into the "educable" whose wills could be broken into becoming "National Comrades" and the "biologically depraved" were to be sterilized, were to be held permanently, and over time were increasingly subject to "annihilation through labour", i.e. being worked to death. <ref name="autogenerated214"/> . 

[[Nazification of Germany|Throughout the 1930s]], the legal, economic, and social rights of Jews were steadily restricted. In legally defining who is Jew, the Nazis considered anyone of Jewish descent, even the descendants of converts who converted from Judaism after January 18, 1871, (the founding of the [[German Empire]]) were still considered Jews. The Israeli historian [[Saul Friedländer]] writes that, for the Nazis, Germany drew its strength for its "purity of blood" and its "rootedness in the sacred German earth."<ref name=PersecutionVolOne133>[[Saul Friedländer|Friedländer, Saul]]. ''Nazi Germany and the Jews Volume 1: The Years of Persecution, 1933–1939''. HarperPerennial 1998, p. 33. </ref> On April 1, 1933, there occurred [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses|boycott]] of Jewish businesses, which was the first national anti-Semitic campaign, initially planned for a week, but called off after one day owing to lack of popular support. In 1933, a series of laws were passed which contained "[[Aryan paragraph]]s" to exclude Jews from key areas: the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], the first anti-Semitic law passed in the Third Reich; the Physicians' Law; and the Farm Law, forbidding Jews from owning farms or taking part in [[agriculture]]. Jewish lawyers were [[disbarment|disbarred]], and in [[Dresden]], Jewish lawyers and judges were dragged out of their offices and courtrooms, and beaten. <ref name=PersecutionVolOne129>Friedländer, Saul. ''Nazi Germany and the Jews Volume 1: The Years of Persecution, 1933–1939''. HarperPerennial 1998, p. 29. </ref> At the insistence of then president [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]], Hitler added an exemption allowing Jewish civil servants who were veterans of the First World War, or whose fathers or sons had served, to remain in office. Hitler revoked this exemption in 1937. Jews were excluded from schools and universities (the Law to Prevent Overcrowding in Schools), from belonging to the Journalists' Association, and from being owners or editors of newspapers. <ref name=PersecutionVolOne133/> The ''Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung'' of April 27, 1933 wrote: . 

{{quotation|A self-respecting nation cannot, on a scale accepted up to now, leave its higher activities in the hands of people of racially foreign origin ...

In July 1933, the [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring]] calling for compulsory sterilization of the "inferior" was passed. This major [[Nazi eugenics|eugenic]] policy led to over 200 [[Hereditary Health Court]]s ({{lang|de|''Erbgesundheitsgerichte''}}) being set up, under whose rulings over 400,000 people were sterilized against their will during the Nazi period. <ref>Robert Proctor, ''Racial Hygiene: Medicine Under the Nazis'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1988): 108. </ref> .

In 1935, Hitler introduced the [[Nuremberg Laws]], which: prohibited Jews from marrying or having sex with "Aryans" (the Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honor), stripped German Jews of their citizenship and deprived them of all [[civil rights]]. In his speech introducing the laws, Hitler said that if the "Jewish problem" cannot be solved by these laws, it "must then be handed over by law to the National-Socialist Party for a [[final solution]] (''Endlösung'')."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/about_holocaust/documents/part1/doc35.html|title=Extracts From Hitler's Speech in the Reichstag on the Nuremberg Laws, September 1935|publisher=Yad Vashem}}</ref> The expression "''Endlösung''" became the standard Nazi [[euphemism]] for the extermination of the Jews. In January 1939, he said in a public speech: "If international-finance Jewry inside and outside Europe should succeed once more in plunging the nations into yet another world war, the consequences will not be the Bolshevization of the earth and thereby the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation (''vernichtung'') of the Jewish race in Europe."<ref>Berenbaum, Michael.

Jewish intellectuals were among the first to leave. The philosopher [[Walter Benjamin]] left for Paris on March 18, 1933. Novelist [[Leon Feuchtwanger]] went to Switzerland. The conductor [[Bruno Walter]] fled after being told that the hall of the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] would be burned down if he conducted a concert there: the ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]'' explained on April 6 that Walter and fellow conductor [[Otto Klemperer]] had been forced to flee because the government was unable to protect them against the mood of the German public, which had been provoked by "Jewish artistic liquidators."<ref name=PersecutionVolOne1>Friedländer, Saul.

===Kristallnacht (1938)===. 
{{main|Kristallnacht}}
On November 7, 1938, Jewish minor [[Herschel Grünspan]] assassinated Nazi German diplomat [[Ernst vom Rath]] in Paris. <ref name=Benz97>Wolfgang Benz, ''Die 101 wichtigsten Fragen- das dritte Reich'', 2nd edition, C.H. Beck, 2007, p.97, ISBN 3-406-56849-1</ref> This incident was used by the [[Nazis]] as a pretext to go beyond legal repression to large-scale physical violence against Jewish Germans. What the Nazis claimed to be spontaneous "public outrage" was in fact a wave of pogroms instigated by the [[Nazi party]], and carried out by [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] members and affiliates throughout Nazi Germany, at the time consisting of [[Weimar Germany|Germany proper]], Austria and [[Sudetenland]]. <ref name=Benz97/> These pogroms became known as ''Reichskristallnacht'' ("the Night of Broken Glass", literally "''Crystal Night''"), or ''November pogroms''. Jews were attacked and Jewish property was vandalized, over 7,000 Jewish shops and 1,668 [[synagogues]] (almost every synagogue in Germany) were damaged or destroyed. The death toll is assumed to be much higher than the official number of 91 dead. <ref name=Benz97/> 30,000 were sent to [[concentration camps]], including [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]], [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]], and [[Oranienburg concentration camp]],<ref>Benz 2007:97 says 26,000 to Dachau, Buchenwald, Sachsenhausen; Buchholz 1999:510 says Pomeranian Jews to Oranienburg</ref> where they were kept for several weeks, and released when they could either prove that they were about to emigrate in the near future, or transferred their property to the Nazis. <ref name="Buchholz, p.510">Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p.510, ISBN 3-88680-272-8</ref> Coinciding with Kristallnacht was the November 11, 1938 passage of ''Regulations Against Jews' Possession of Weapons'', which made it illegal for Jews to possess firearms or other weapons (see [[The 1938 German Weapons Act]]). <ref>Halbrook, Stephen P.

===Resettlement and deportation===. 
Before the war, the Nazis considered mass exportation of German (and subsequently the European) Jewry from Europe. Plans to reclaim former German colonies such as [[Tanganyika]] and [[South West Africa]] for Jewish resettlement were halted by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], who argued that no place where "so much blood of heroic Germans had been spilled" should be made available as a residence for the "worst enemies of the Germans". <ref>Magnus Brechtken, ''Madagaskar für die Juden: antisemitische Idee und politische Praxis 1885–1945'', 2nd edition, Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, 1998, pp.200–201, ISBN 3-486-56384-X</ref> Diplomatic efforts were undertaken to convince the other former colonial powers, primarily the United Kingdom and France, to accept expelled Jews in their colonies. <ref>Magnus Brechtken, ''Madagaskar für die Juden: antisemitische Idee und politische Praxis 1885–1945'', 2nd edition, Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, 1998, pp.196ff, ISBN 3-486-56384-X</ref> Areas considered for possible resettlement included British [[Palestine]],<ref name=Brectken207>Magnus Brechtken, ''Madagaskar für die Juden: antisemitische Idee und politische Praxis 1885–1945'', 2nd edition, Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, 1998, p.207, ISBN 3-486-56384-X</ref> Italian [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]],<ref name=Brectken207/> British [[Rhodesia]],<ref name=Poprzeczny150>Joseph Poprzeczny, ''Odilo Globocnik, Hitler's man in the East'', McFarland, 2004, p.150, ISBN 0-7864-1625-4</ref> French [[Madagascar]],<ref name=Brectken207/> and Australia. <ref>Magnus Brechtken, ''Madagaskar für die Juden: antisemitische Idee und politische Praxis 1885–1945'', 2nd edition, Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, 1998, p.197, ISBN 3-486-56384-X</ref> . 

Of these areas, [[Madagascar]] was the most seriously discussed. [[Reinhard Heydrich|Heydrich]] called the [[Madagascar Plan]] a "territorial final solution"; it was a remote location, and the island's unfavorable conditions would hasten deaths. <ref>{{cite book|last=Naimark|first=Norman M.|authorlink=Norman_Naimark|title=Fires of hatred|url=http://books.google.com/?id=L-QLXnX16kAC|accessdate=April 20, 2009|year=2001|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|isbn=978-0-674-00994-3|oclc=|doi=|id=|page=73|chapter=The Nazi Attack on the Jews|chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=L-QLXnX16kAC&pg=PA73&dq=Madagascar+Plan&sig=FafySVgGSk3recIuaIv8bSfm4ps|ref=|bibcode=|laysummary=|laydate=}}</ref> In retrospect, although futile, this plan did constitute an important psychological step on the path to the Holocaust. <ref>{{cite book|last=Browning|first=Christopher R.|authorlink=Christopher Browning|coauthors=Matthäus, Jürgen|title=The Origins of the Final Solution|url=http://books.google.com/?id=jHQdRHNdK44C|accessdate=April 20, 2009|year=2007|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|isbn=978-0-8032-5979-9|oclc=|doi=|id=|page=81|chapter=The Search for a Final solution through Expulsion, 1939–1941|chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=jHQdRHNdK44C&pg=PA81&dq=Madagascar+Plan&sig=XLRq7StzFTkTYIgyKMzIWGdgXC0|ref=|bibcode=|laysummary=|laydate=}}</ref> Approved by Hitler in 1938, the resettlement planning was carried out by [[Adolf Eichmann|Eichmann's]] office, only being abandoned once the mass killing of Jews began in 1941.

Palestine was the only location to which any Nazi relocation plan succeeded in producing significant results, by means of an agreement begun in 1933 between the Zionist Federation of Germany (''die Zionistische Vereinigung für Deutschland'') and the Nazi government, the [[Haavara Agreement]].

===Early measures===. 
====In German occupied Poland====. 
{{main|The Holocaust in Poland}}
{{see|Invasion of Poland (1939)|Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|History of the Jews in Poland}}
[[File:Germany1941.png|thumb|350px|[[Nazi Germany]] 1941, including [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|areas annexed from Poland]] and the [[General Government]] area.]] . 

The question of the treatment of the Jews became an urgent one for the Nazis after September 1939, when they [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invaded the western half of Poland]], home to about two million Jews. The pre-war [[Second Polish Republic]] had been divided between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, in the preceding [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]]. Of the German share of Poland, [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|the north-western parts were annexed]], while the south-eastern parts were made the [[General Government]], administered by [[Hans Frank]]. The invasion led Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, and France to declare war—World War II had started.  . 

Himmler's right-hand man, [[Reinhard Heydrich]], recommended concentrating all the Polish Jews in [[ghetto]]s in major cities, where they would be put to work for the German war industry. The ghettos would be in cities located on railway junctions, so that, in Heydrich's words, "future measures can be accomplished more easily."<ref name=Padfield270>Padfield, Peter. ''Himmler: Reichsfuhrer SS''. Macmillian 1990, p. 270. Padfield gives as his source for both the Heydrich quote and Eichmann's comment on it J von Lang and C Sybill (eds) ''Eichmann Interrogated''. Bodley Head, London 1982, pp. 92–93. </ref> During his interrogation in 1961, [[Adolf Eichmann]] testified that the expression "future measures" was understood to mean "physical extermination."<ref name=Padfield270/> .

[[File:GermanPoliceTormentingJew.JPG|thumb|German policemen tormenting a Jew in [[Rzeszów]], Poland.]]
In September, Himmler appointed Heydrich head of the [[RSHA|Reich Main Security Office]] (''Reichssicherheitshauptamt'' or RSHA, not be to confused with the [[RuSHA]]). This body was to oversee the work of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], the [[Sicherheitsdienst|Security Police]] (SD), and the [[Gestapo]] in occupied Poland, and carry out the policy towards the Jews described in Heydrich's report. The first organized murders of Jews by German forces occurred during [[Operation Tannenberg]] and through [[Selbstschutz]] units. Later, the Jews were herded into ghettos, mostly in the General Government area of central Poland, where they were put to work under the Reich Labor Office headed by [[Fritz Sauckel]]. Here many thousands died from maltreatment, disease, starvation, and exhaustion, but there was still no program of systematic killing. There is no doubt, however, that the Nazis saw forced labor as a form of extermination. The expression ''Vernichtung durch Arbeit'' ("destruction through work") was frequently used. 
{{see|Jewish ghettos in German-occupied Poland}} . 

Although it was clear by 1941 that the SS hierarchy was determined to embark on a policy of killing all the Jews under German control, there was still opposition to this policy within the Nazi regime, although the motive was economic, not [[humanitarian]]. [[Hermann Göring]], who had overall control of the German war industry, and the German army's Economics Department, argued that the enormous Jewish labor force assembled in the General Government area (more than a million able-bodied workers) was an asset too valuable to waste while Germany was preparing to invade the Soviet Union.  . 

====In other occupied countries====. 
When [[Nazi Germany]] occupied Norway, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, and France in 1940, and Yugoslavia and Greece in 1941, anti-Semitic measures were also introduced into these countries, although the pace and severity varied greatly from country to country according to local political circumstances. Jews were removed from economic and cultural life and were subject to various restrictive laws, but physical deportation did not occur in most places before 1942. The [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime in occupied France actively collaborated in persecuting French Jews. Germany's allies Italy, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Finland were pressured to introduce antisemitic measures, but for the most part they did not comply until compelled to do so. During the course of the war some 900 Jews and 300 Roma passed through the concentration camp Banjica in Belgrade, intended primarily for Serbian communists, royalists and other patriots who resisted occupation. The German puppet regime in Croatia, on the other hand, began actively persecuting Jews on its own initiative, so the ''Legal Decree on the Nationalization of the Property of Jews and Jewish Companies'' was declared on October 10, 1941 in the Independent State of Croatia.  .

In October 1940, ''Gauleiters'' [[Josef Bürckel]] and [[Robert Heinrich Wagner]] oversaw Operation Bürckel, the expulsion of the Jews into unoccupied France from their ''Gaues'' and the parts of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] that had been annexed that summer to the ''Reich''. <ref name="autogenerated1968">Krausnick, Helmut "The Persecution of the Jews" pages 1–125 from ''The Anatomy of the SS State'', New York: Walker and Company, 1968 page 57. </ref> Only those Jews in mixed marriages were not expelled. <ref name="autogenerated1968"/> The 6,500 Jews affected by Operation Bürckel were given at most two hours warning on the night of October 22–23, 1940, before being rounded up. The nine trains carrying the deported Jews crossed over into France "without any warning to the French authorities", who were not happy to receive them. <ref name="autogenerated1968"/> The deportees had not been allowed to take any of their possessions with them, these being confiscated by the German authorities. <ref name="autogenerated1968"/> The German Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] treated the ensuing complaints by the Vichy government over the expulsions in a "most dilatory fashion". <ref name="autogenerated1968"/> As a result, the Jews expelled in Operation Bürckel were interned in harsh conditions by the Vichy authorities at the camps in [[Gurs internment camp|Gurs]], [[Rivesaltes]] and [[Camp des Milles|Les Milles]] while awaiting a chance to return them to Germany. <ref name="autogenerated1968"/> . 

During 1940 and 1941, murder of large numbers of Jews in German-occupied Poland continued, and the deportation of Jews to the General Government was undertaken. The deportation of Jews from Germany, particularly Berlin, was not officially completed until 1943. (Many Berlin Jews were able to survive in hiding.) By December 1939, 3.5 million Jews were crowded into the General Government area.  . 

===Concentration and labor camps (1933–1945)===. 
{{see|Nazi concentration camps|List of Nazi concentration camps|Extermination through labor}} . 

[[File:Rows of bodies of dead inmates fill the yard of Lager Nordhausen, a Gestapo concentration camp.jpg|thumb|April 12, 1945: [[Mittelbau-Dora|Lager Nordhausen]], where 20,000 inmates are believed to have died.]]
From the beginning of the Third Reich [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] were founded, initially as places of incarceration. Though the death rate in the concentration camps was high, with a mortality rate of 50%, they were not designed to be killing centres. (By 1942, six large extermination camps had been established in Nazi-occupied Poland,<ref name=CampTimeline/> which were built solely for mass killings.) After 1939, the camps increasingly became places where Jews and [[POW]]s were either killed or made to work as slave laborers, undernourished and tortured. <ref>{{cite book|last=Harran|first=Marilyn|title=The Holocaust Chronicles, A History in Words and Pictures|year=2000|publisher=Publications International|page=Pg.321|isbn=0-7853-2963-3}} [http://www.holocaustchronicle.org/index.html Full text]</ref> It is estimated that the Germans established 15,000 camps and subcamps in the occupied countries, mostly in eastern Europe. <ref>[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/cclist.html "Concentration Camp Listing"], Jewish Virtual Library. </ref><ref>[http://www.jewishgen.org/ForgottenCamps/ "The Forgotten Camps"]. </ref> New camps were founded in areas with large Jewish, Polish intelligentsia, communist, or Roma and Sinti populations, including inside Germany. The transportation of prisoners was often carried out under horrifying conditions using rail freight cars, in which many died before reaching their destination.  . 

[[Extermination through labour]] was a policy of systematic extermination — camp inmates would literally be worked to death, or worked to physical exhaustion, when they would be gassed or shot. Slave labour was used in war production, for example producing [[V-2]] rockets at [[Mittelbau-Dora]], and various armaments around the [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]] complex.  . 

Upon admission, some camps [[Identification in Nazi camps|tattooed prisoners]] with a prisoner ID. <ref>{{cite book|last=Harran|first=Marilyn|title=The Holocaust Chronicles, A History in Words and Pictures|year=2000|publisher=Publications International|page=Pg.461|isbn=0-7853-2963-3}} [http://www.holocaustchronicle.org/index.html Full text]</ref> Those fit for work were dispatched for 12 to 14 hour shifts.

===Ghettos (1940–1945)===. 
{{main|Ghettos in occupied Europe 1939-1944|List of Nazi-era ghettos}}

[[File:Childwarsawghetto.jpg|thumb|A child dying in the streets of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]]]]
After the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]], the Nazis established [[ghetto]]s in which Jews and some Romani were confined, until they were eventually shipped to extermination camps to be murdered. The Warsaw Ghetto was the largest, with 380,000 people, and the Łódź Ghetto the second largest, holding 160,000. They were, in effect, immensely crowded prisons, described by Michael Berenbaum as instruments of "slow, passive murder."<ref name=Berenbaum114>[[Michael Berenbaum|Berenbaum, Michael]]. ''The World Must Know'', United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2006, p. 114. </ref> Though the Warsaw Ghetto contained 400,000 people—30% of the population of Warsaw—it occupied only 2.4% of the city's area, averaging 9.2 people per room. <ref name=USHMMDeportationsWarsaw/> . 

From 1940 through 1942, starvation and disease, especially [[typhoid fever|typhoid]], killed hundreds of thousands. Over 43,000 residents of the Warsaw ghetto died there in 1941,<ref name=USHMMDeportationsWarsaw/> more than one in ten; in [[Theresienstadt]], more than half the residents died in 1942. <ref name=Berenbaum114/>
{{rquote|right|'''The Germans came, the police, and they started banging houses: "Raus, raus, raus, Juden raus." ... [O]ne baby started to cry ... The other baby started crying. So the mother urinated in her hand and gave the baby a drink to keep quiet ... [When the police had gone], I told the mothers to come out. And one baby was dead ... from fear, the mother [had] choked her own baby.'''|Abraham Malik, describing his experience in the [[Kovno Ghetto]]. <ref>Berenbaum, Michael. ''The World Must Know'', United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2006, p. 115–116. </ref>}} . 

Each ghetto was run by a ''[[Judenrat]]'' (Jewish council) of German-appointed Jewish community leaders, who were responsible for the day-to-day running of the ghetto, including the distribution of food, water, heat, medicine, and shelter, and who were also expected to make arrangements for deportations to extermination camps. Himmler ordered the start of the deportations on July 19, 1942, and three days later, on July 22, the deportations from the Warsaw Ghetto began; over the next 52 days, until September 12, 300,000 people from Warsaw alone were [[Holocaust trains|transported in freight trains]] to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]]. Many other ghettos were completely depopulated.  . 

Berenbaum writes that the defining moment that tested the courage and character of each ''Judenrat'' came when they were asked to provide a list of names of the next group to be deported. The ''Judenrat'' members went through the tried and tested methods of delay, bribery, stonewalling, pleading, and argumentation, until finally a decision had to be made. Some, like [[Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski|Chaim Rumkowski]], argued that their responsibility was to save the Jews who ''could'' be saved, and that therefore others had to be sacrificed; others argued, following [[Maimonides]], that not a single individual should be handed over who had not committed a [[capital crime]]. ''Judenrat'' leaders such as Dr. Joseph Parnas in [[Lviv]], who refused to compile a list, were shot. On October 14, 1942, the entire ''Judenrat'' of Byaroza committed suicide rather than cooperate with the deportations. <ref>Berenbaum, Michael. ''The World Must Know'', United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, this edition 2006, pp. 81–83. </ref> . 

The first [[ghetto uprising]] occurred in September 1942 in the small town of [[Lakhva|Łachwa]] in south-east Poland. Though there were armed resistance attempts in the larger ghettos in 1943, such as the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] and the [[Białystok Ghetto Uprising]], in every case they failed against the overwhelming Nazi military force, and the remaining Jews were either killed or deported to the death camps. <ref>Berenbaum, Michael. ''The World Must Know'', United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, this edition 2006, p 116. </ref> . 

===Pogroms (1939–1942)===. 
{{main|Pogrom|Dorohoi Pogrom|Iaşi pogrom|Jedwabne Massacre|Legionnaires' Rebellion and Bucharest Pogrom|History of Lviv#Lviv pogroms and the Holocaust|Odessa massacre}}
A number of deadly [[pogrom]]s by local populations occurred during the Second World War, some with Nazi encouragement, and some spontaneously. This included the [[Iaşi pogrom]] in Romania on June 30, 1941, in which as many as 14,000 Jews were killed by Romanian residents and police, and the [[Jedwabne massacre|Jedwabne pogrom]], in which between 380 and 1,600 Jews were killed by local Poles in July 1941. <ref>The inscription on the memorial stone raised in the place of the barn at Jedwabne read: "Place of torture and execution of the Jewish population.

Members of the local populations in certain occupied Soviet territories participated actively in the killings of Jews and others. <ref name=Browning_268>Browning, Christopher, and Matthäus, Jürgen, ''Origins of the Final Solution: The Evolution of Nazi Jewish Policy September 1939 -March 1942'', Yad Vashem / University of Nebraska Press 2004 ISBN 0-8032-1327-1, at pages 268–277. </ref> In Lithuania, Latvia and western Ukraine, locals were deeply involved in the murder of Jews from the very beginning of the German occupation. <ref name=Browning_268/> The Latvian [[Arajs Kommando]] was an example of an auxiliary unit involved in these killings. <ref name=Browning_268/> To the south, Ukrainians killed approximately 24,000 Jews. <ref name=Browning_268/> In addition, Latvian and Lithuanian units left their own countries, and committed murders of Jews in Belarus, and Ukrainians served as concentration and death camp guards in Poland. <ref name=Browning_268/> [[Ustaše]] militia in Croatian areas also carried out acts of persecution and murder. Ultimately it was the Germans who organized and channelled these local participants in the Holocaust. <ref name=Browning_268/> . 

Many of the mass killings were carried out in public, a change from previous practice. <ref name=Browning_268/> German witnesses to these killings emphasized the participation of the locals. <ref name=Browning_268/> The massacres committed by the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were usually justified under the grounds of anti-partisan or anti-bandit operations, but the German historian [[Andreas Hillgruber]] wrote that this was merely an excuse for the German Army's considerable involvement in the Holocaust in Russia and the terms "war crimes" and "crimes against humanity" were indeed correct labels for what happened. <ref>Hillgruber, Andreas "War in the East and the Extermination of the Jews" pages 85–114 from ''The Nazi Holocaust Part 3, The "Final Solution": The Implementation of Mass Murder Volume 1'' edited by Michael Marrus, Mecler: Westpoint, CT 1989 pages 102–103. </ref> Hillgruber maintained that the slaughter of about 2.2 million defenceless men, women and children for the reasons of racist ideology cannot possibly be justified for any reason, and that those German generals who claimed that the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were a necessary anti-partisan response were lying. <ref>Hillgruber, Andreas "War in the East and the Extermination of the Jews" pages 85–114 from ''The Nazi Holocaust Part 3, The "Final Solution": The Implementation of Mass Murder Volume 1'' edited by Michael Marrus, Mecler: Westpoint, CT 1989 page 103. </ref> .

Army co-operation with the SS in anti-partisan and anti-Jewish operations was close and intensive. <ref name=Forster1988p276>Förster, Jürgen "Complicity or Entanglement?" pages 266–293 from ''The Holocaust and History'' edited by Michael Berenbaum and Abraham Peck, Bloomington: Indiana University Press 1998, page 276. </ref> In the summer of 1941, the [[SS Cavalry Brigade]] commanded by [[Hermann Fegelein]] during the course of "anti-partisan" [[Pripyat swamps (punitive operation)|operations]] in the [[Pripyat Marshes]] killed 699 Red Army soldiers, 1,100 partisans and 14,178 Jews. <ref name=Forster1988p276/> Before the operation, Fegelein had been ordered to shoot all adult Jews while driving the women and children into the marshes. After the operation, General Max von Schenckendorff, who commanded the rear areas of [[Army Group Centre]] ordered on August 10, 1941 that all ''Wehrmacht'' [[Security Division (Germany)|security divisions]] when on anti-partisan duty to emulate Fegelein's example, and organized in [[Mogilev]] between September 24–26, 1941 a joint SS-''Wehrmacht'' seminar on how best to murder Jews. <ref name=Forster1988p276/> The seminar ended with the 7th Company of Police Battalion 322 shooting 32 Jews at village called Knjashizy before the assembled officers as an example of how to "screen" the population for partisans. <ref name="Förster 1998, page 277">Förster, Jürgen "Complicity or Entanglement?" pages 266–293 from ''The Holocaust and History'' edited by Michael Berenbaum and Abraham Peck, Bloomington: Indiana University Press 1998, page 277. </ref> As the war diary of the Battalion 322 read: .

{{Quotation|''Jews and Gypsies'':...As already has been ordered, the Jews have to vanish from the flat country and the Gypsies have to be annihilated too.

The German historian Jürgen Förster, a leading expert on the subject of ''Wehrmacht'' war crimes argued the ''Wehrmacht'' played a key role in the Holocaust, and it is wrong to describe the ''Shoah'' as solely the work of the SS with the ''Wehrmacht'' as a passive and disapproving bystander. <ref>Förster, Jürgen "Complicity or Entanglement?" pages 266–293 from ''The Holocaust and History'' edited by Michael Berenbaum and Abraham Peck, Bloomington: Indiana University Press 1998 page 280. </ref>

The large-scale killings of Jews in the occupied Soviet territories was assigned to SS formations called ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' ("task groups"), under the overall command of Heydrich. These had been used on a limited scale in Poland in 1939, but were now organized on a much larger scale. ''Einsatzgruppe'' A was assigned to the Baltic area, ''Einsatzgruppe'' B to Belarus, ''Einsatzgruppe'' C to north and central Ukraine, and ''Einsatzgruppe'' D to Moldova, south Ukraine, the [[Crimea]], and, during 1942, the north [[Caucasus]]. <ref>{{cite book|last=Browning|first=Christopher R.|title=The Origins of the Final Solution: The Evolution of Nazi Jewish Policy, September 1939 – March 1942 (Comprehensive History of the Holocaust)|isbn=978-0-8032-1327-2|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|year=2004|pages=225–226|url=http://books.google.com/?id=d9Wg4gjtP3cC&pg=RA1-PA226&dq=%22dr+otto+ohlendorf%22}}</ref> . 

According to Ohlendorf at [[Einsatzgruppen Trial|his trial]], "the ''Einsatzgruppen'' had the mission to protect the rear of the troops by killing the Jews, Gypsies, Communist functionaries, active Communists, and all persons who would endanger the security." In practice, their victims were nearly all defenseless Jewish civilians (not a single ''Einsatzgruppe'' member was killed in action during these operations). By December 1941, the four ''Einsatzgruppen'' listed above had killed, respectively, 125,000, 45,000, 75,000, and 55,000 people—a total of 300,000 people—mainly by shooting or with hand grenades at mass killing sites outside the major towns.  . 

The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum tells the story of one survivor of the ''Einsatzgruppen'' in [[Piryatin]], [[Ukraine]], when they killed 1,600 Jews on April 6, 1942, the second day of [[Passover]]: . 

{{Quotation|I saw them do the killing. At 5:00 p.m. they gave the command, "Fill in the pits." Screams and groans were coming from the pits.

A boy of five years crawled out from under her body and began to scream desperately. "Mommy!" That was all I saw, since I fell unconscious. <ref name=Berenbaum93/>}} . 

The most notorious massacre of Jews in the Soviet Union was at a ravine called [[Babi Yar]] outside [[Kiev]], where 33,771 Jews were killed in a single operation on September 29–30, 1941. The killing of all the Jews in Kiev was decided on by the military governor (Major-General [[Friedrich-Georg Eberhardt|Friedrich Eberhardt]]), the Police Commander for Army Group South (SS-''Obergruppenführer'' [[Friedrich Jeckeln]]) and the ''Einsatzgruppe'' C Commander Otto Rasch. It was carried out by a mixture of SS, SD and Security Police, assisted by Ukrainian police.  . 

On Monday the Jews of Kiev gathered by the [[cemetery]], expecting to be loaded onto trains. The crowd was large enough that most of the men, women, and children could not have known what was happening until it was too late: by the time they heard the machine-gun fire, there was no chance to escape. All were driven down a corridor of soldiers, in groups of ten, and then shot. A truck driver described the scene, as
{{Quotation|one after the other, they had to remove their luggage, then their coats, shoes, and outer garments and also underwear ... Once undressed, they were led into the ravine which was about 150 meters long and 30 meters wide and a good 15 meters deep ...

In August 1941 Himmler travelled to [[Minsk]], where he personally witnessed 100 Jews being shot in a ditch outside the town, an event described by [[Karl Wolff]] in his diary. "Himmler's face was green. He took out his handkerchief and wiped his cheek where a piece of brain had squirted up onto it. Then he vomited." After recovering his composure, he lectured the SS men on the need to follow the "highest moral law of the Party" in carrying out their tasks.  . 

===New methods of mass murder===. 
Starting in December 1939, the Nazis introduced new methods of mass murder by using gas. <ref name=Benz98>Wolfgang Benz, ''Die 101 wichtigsten Fragen- das dritte Reich'', 2nd edition, C.H. Beck, 2007, p.98, ISBN 3-406-56849-1</ref> First, experimental [[gas van]]s equipped with gas cylinders and a sealed trunk compartment, were used to kill mental care clients of [[sanatoria]] in [[Pomerania Province (1815-1945)|Pomerania]], [[East Prussia]], and [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupied Poland]], as part of an operation termed [[Action T4]]. <ref name=Benz98/> In the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]], larger vans holding up to 100 people were used from November 1941, using the engine's exhaust rather than a cylinder. <ref name=Benz98/> These vans were introduced to the [[Chełmno concentration camp]] in December 1941, and another 15 of them were used by the Einsatzgruppen in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|occupied Soviet Union]]. <ref name=Benz98/> These gas vans were developed and run under supervision of the [[SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt|Reich Main Security Office]], and were used to kill about 500,000 people, primarily Jews, but also [[Romani people|Romani]] and others. <ref name=Benz98/> The vans were carefully monitored and after a month of observation a report stated that 'ninety seven thousand have been processed using three vans, without any defects showing up in the machines'. <ref>Quoted in Kogon, E., H. Langbein, and A. Rueckerl (Eds.) 1993. Nazi Mass Murder: A Documentary History of the Use of Poison Gas. New Haven: Yale University Press. </ref> . 

A need for new mass murder techniques was also expressed by [[Hans Frank]], governor of the General Government, who noted that this many people could not be simply shot. "We shall have to take steps, however, designed in some way to eliminate them." It was this problem which led the SS to experiment with large-scale killings using poison gas. Finally, [[Christian Wirth]] seems to have been the inventor of the gas chamber.  .

[[File:Hoefletelegram.jpg|left|thumb|The Nazis methodically tracked the progress of the Holocaust in thousands of reports and documents. Pictured is the [[Höfle Telegram]] sent to Adolf Eichmann in January, 1943, that reported that 1,274,166 Jews had been killed in the four [[Aktion Reinhard]] camps during 1942.]]
The Wannsee Conference was convened by [[Reinhard Heydrich]] on January 20, 1942 in the Berlin suburb of Wannsee and brought together some 15 Nazi leaders which included a number of state secretaries, senior officials, party leaders, SS officers and other leaders of government departments who were responsible for policies which were linked to Jewish issues. The initial purpose of the meeting was to discuss plans for a comprehensive solution to the "Jewish question in Europe."  Heydrich intended to "outline the mass murders in the various occupied territories ...as part of a solution to the European Jewish question ordered by Hitler..to ensure that they, and especially the ministerial bureaucracy, would share  both knowledge and responsibility for this policy." <ref>Longerich, ''Holocaust'', p. 305. </ref> . 

A copy of the minutes which were drawn up by Eichmann has survived, but on Heydrich's instructions, they were written up in "euphemistic language." Thus the exact words used at the meeting are not known. <ref>Longerich, ''Holocaust'', p. 306. </ref>  However, Heydrich addressed the meeting  indicating the the policy of emigration was superseded by a policy of evacuating Jews to the east.  This was seen to be only a temporary solution leading up to a final solution which would involve some 11 million Jews living not only in territories controlled then by the Germans, but to major countries in the rest of the world including the UK, and the US. <ref>Longerich, ''Holocaust'', 307. </ref>  There was little doubt what the solution was: "Heydrich also made it clear what was understood by the phrase 'Final Solution': the Jews were to be annihilated by a combination of forced labour and mass murder." <ref>Longerich, ''Holocaust'', p. 308. </ref> . 

The officials were told there were 2.3 million Jews in the General Government, 850,000 in Hungary, 1.1 million in the other occupied countries, and up to 5 million in the USSR, although 2 million of these were in areas still under Soviet control — a total of about 6.5 million. These would all be transported by train to [[extermination camp]]s (''Vernichtungslager'') in Poland, where almost all of them would be gassed at once. In some camps, such as Auschwitz, those fit for work would be kept alive for a while, but eventually all would be killed. Göring's representative, Dr. [[Erich Neumann (politician)|Erich Neumann]], gained a limited exemption for some classes of industrial workers. <ref name=Wannseeprotocol>[http://www.ghwk.de/engl/protengl.htm Protocol of the Wannsee Conference], ''Haus der Wannsee-Konferenz''. </ref> . 

===German public reaction===. 
In his 1983 book, ''Popular Opinion and Political Dissent in the Third Reich'', [[Ian Kershaw]] examined the ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]'' (history of everyday life) in Bavaria during the Nazi period. <ref>Marrus, Michael ''The Holocaust in History'', Toronto: KeyPorter, 2000 page 89. </ref> Describing the attitudes of most Bavarians, Kershaw argued that the most common viewpoint was indifference towards what was happening to the Jews. <ref name=Marrus89-90>Marrus, Michael ''The Holocaust in History'', Toronto: KeyPorter, 2000 pages 89–90. </ref> Kershaw argued that most Bavarians were vaguely aware of the ''Shoah'', but were vastly more concerned about the war than about the "Final Solution to the Jewish Question". <ref name=Marrus89-90/> Kershaw made the claim that "the road to Auschwitz was built by hate, but paved with indifference". <ref>Evans, Richard ''In Hitler's Shadow'', New York, NY: Pantheon, 1989 page 71</ref><ref>Marrus, Michael ''The Holocaust in History'', Toronto: KeyPorter, 2000 page 91. </ref> . 

Kershaw's assessment that most Bavarians, and by implication most Germans, were indifferent to the ''Shoah'' faced criticism from the Israeli historian Otto Dov Kulka, an expert on public opinion in Nazi Germany, and the Canadian historian Michael Kater. Kater contended that Kershaw downplayed the extent of popular antisemitism, and that though admitting that most of the "spontaneous" antisemitic actions of Nazi Germany were staged, argued that because these actions involved substantial numbers of Germans, it is wrong to see the extreme antisemitism of the Nazis as coming solely from above. <ref>Marrus, Michael ''The Holocaust in History'', Toronto: KeyPorter, 2000 page 92. </ref> Kulka argued that most Germans were more anti-Semitic than Kershaw portrayed them in ''Popular Opinion and Political Dissent'', and that rather than "indifference", "passive complicity" would be a better term to describe the reaction of the German people. <ref>Marrus, Michael ''The Holocaust in History'', Toronto: KeyPorter, 2000 page 93. </ref> . 

In a study focusing only on the views about Jews of Germans opposed to the Nazi regime, the German historian Christof Dipper in his 1983 essay "''Der Deutsche Widerstand und die Juden''" (translated into English as "The German Resistance and the Jews" in ''Yad Vashem Studies'', Volume 16, 1984) argued that the majority of the anti-Nazi national-conservatives were antisemitic. <ref name=Marrus92>Marrus, Michael ''The Holocaust In History'', Toronto: Key Porter 2000 page 92. </ref> Dipper wrote that for the majority of the national-conservatives "the bureaucratic, pseudo-legal deprivation of the Jews practiced until 1938 was still considered acceptable". <ref name=Marrus92/> Though Dipper noted no one in the [[German resistance]] supported the Holocaust, he also commented that the national-conservatives did not intend to restore civil rights to the Jews after the planned overthrow of Hitler. <ref name=Marrus92/> Dipper went on to argue that, based on such views held by opponents of the regime, "a large part of the German people...believed that a "Jewish Question" existed and had to be solved...". <ref name=Marrus92/> . 

===Motivation===. 
In his 1965 essay "Command and Compliance", which originated in his work as an expert witness for the prosecution at the [[Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials]], the German historian Hans Buchheim wrote there was no coercion to murder Jews and others, and all who committed such actions did so out of free will. <ref name="Buchheim373">Buchheim, Hans "Command and Compliance" pp 303–396 from ''The Anatomy of the SS State'', Walker and Company: New York, 1968 pp 372–373. </ref> Buchheim wrote that chances to avoid executing criminal orders "...were both more numerous and more real than those concerned are generally prepared to admit...",<ref name="Buchheim373" /> and that he found no evidence that SS men who refused to carry out criminal orders were sent to a concentration camps or executed. <ref>Buchheim, Hans "Command and Compliance" pp 303–396 from ''The Anatomy of the SS State'', Walker and Company: New York, 1968 p 381. </ref> Moreover, SS rules prohibited acts of gratuitous sadism, as Himmler wished for his men to remain "decent", and that acts of sadism were taken on the individual initiative of those who were either especially cruel or who wished to prove themselves ardent National Socialists. <ref name="Buchheim373" /> Finally, he argued that those of a non-criminal bent who committed crimes did so because they wished to conform to the values of the group they had joined and were afraid of being branded "weak" by their by colleagues if they refused. <ref>Buchheim, Hans "Command and Compliance" pp 303–396 from ''The Anatomy of the SS State'', Walker and Company: New York, 1968 pp 386–387. </ref> . 

In his 1992 book ''Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland'', [[Christopher Browning]] examined the German ''[[Ordnungspolizei]]'' Reserve Battalion 101, used to massacre and round up Jews for deportation to the Nazi death camps. The men of the battalion were middle-aged men of working class background from [[Hamburg]], who were unfit for military duty and were given no special training for genocide. The commander of the unit gave his men the choice of opting out of direct participation if they found it too unpleasant (for example, by being part of a passive cordon round the area of the killing). The majority chose not to exercise that option— fewer than 15 men out of a battalion of 500 did so. <ref>Browning, Christopher ''Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland'', New York: HarperCollins, 1992 p 57</ref> Much-influenced by the work of [[Stanley Milgram]], Browning argued that the men of the battalion killed out of obedience to authority and peer pressure, not blood-lust or hatred. The general implication of the book is that when placed in a cohesive group setting, most people will obey commands given by an authority-figure seen as legitimate, even if they find them morally reprehensible— a hypothesis studied in the [[Milgram Experiment]].  . 

The Russian historian Sergei Kudryashov studied the guards trained at the [[Trawniki concentration camp]], who provided the bulk of personnel for the [[Operation Reinhard]] death camps. Some Trawniki guards were Red Army POWs who volunteered to join the SS in order to get out of the POW camps. <ref>Kudryashov, Sergei "Ordinary Collaborators: The Case of the Travniki Guards" pp 226–239 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy Essays in Honour of John Erickson'' edited by Mark and Ljubica Erickson, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2004 pp 232–233. </ref> The majority of the Trawniki men were Ukrainians or ''[[Volksdeutche]]'', though there were also Russians, Poles, Latvians, Lithuanians, Tartars, Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis amongst them. <ref>Kudryashov, Sergei "Ordinary Collaborators: The Case of the Travniki Guards" pp 226–239 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy Essays in Honour of John Erickson'' edited by Mark and Ljubica Erickson, p 232. </ref> Kudryashov reported that he found there was little sign of antisemitism or any attraction to National Socialism among the Trawniki men, many of whom prior to their capture had been Communists. <ref name="autogenerated226">Kudryashov, Sergei "Ordinary Collaborators: The Case of the Travniki Guards" pp 226–239 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy Essays in Honour of John Erickson'' edited by Mark and Ljubica Erickson, p 234. </ref> Despite the generally apathetic views of the Trawniki guards, the vast majority faithfully carried out the SS's expectations of how to mistreat Jews; the mistreatment of Jews by the Trawniki guards was "systematic and without any particular cause". <ref name="autogenerated226"/> Many, through not all of the Trawniki men executed Jews, and almost all of them while working as guards in the Operation Reinhard camps personally killed dozens of Jews. <ref>Kudryashov, Sergei "Ordinary Collaborators: The Case of the Travniki Guards" pp 226–239 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy Essays in Honour of John Erickson'' edited by Mark and Ljubica Erickson, pp 234–235. </ref> Following Christopher Browning, Kudryashov argued that the Trawniki men were examples of ordinary people becoming willing killers out of peer pressure and obedience to authority. <ref>Kudryashov, Sergei "Ordinary Collaborators: The Case of the Travniki Guards" pp 226–239 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy Essays in Honour of John Erickson'' edited by Mark and Ljubica Erickson, pp 226–227 & 234–235. </ref> .

During 1942, in addition to Auschwitz, five other camps were designated as extermination camps (''Vernichtungslager'') for the carrying out of the Reinhard plan. <ref name=aktr>{{cite web|url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/microsoft%20word%20-%205724.pdf|title=Aktion Reinhard|publisher=Yad Vashem|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>Although [[Chełmno extermination camp|Chełmno]] was not technically part of [[Operation Reinhard|Aktion Reinhard]], it began functioning as an extermination camp in December 1941.[http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/microsoft%20word%20-%205915.pdf Yadvashem.org]</ref> Two of these, Chełmno (also known as Kulmhof) and [[Majdanek]] were already functioning as labor camps: these now had extermination facilities added to them. Three new camps were built for the sole purpose of killing large numbers of Jews as quickly as possible, at [[Belzec extermination camp|Belzec]], [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]] and [[Treblinka]]. A seventh camp, at [[Maly Trostinets]] in Belarus, was also used for this purpose. [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]] was an extermination camp where mostly ethnic [[Serbs]] were killed.  . 

Extermination camps are frequently confused with concentration camps such as [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] and [[Belsen]], which were mostly located in Germany and intended as places of incarceration and forced labor for a variety of enemies of the Nazi regime (such as Communists and homosexuals). They should also be distinguished from slave labor camps, which were set up in all German-occupied countries to exploit the labor of prisoners of various kinds, including prisoners of war. In all Nazi camps there were very high death rates as a result of starvation, disease and exhaustion, but only the extermination camps were designed specifically for mass killing.  . 

{{rquote|left|'''''There was a place called the ramp where the trains with the Jews were coming in. They were coming in day and night, and sometimes one per day and sometimes five per day ... Constantly, people from the heart of Europe were disappearing, and they were arriving to the same place with the same ignorance of the fate of the previous transport. And the people in this mass ... I knew that within a couple of hours ... ninety percent would be gassed.'''''|[[Rudolf Vrba]], who worked on the ''Judenrampe'' in [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] from August 18, 1942 to June 7, 1943. <ref name=isbn0-316-09134-0>{{cite book|author=[[Rudolf Vrba]] cited in Berenbaum, Michael|title=The world must know: the history of the Holocaust as told in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|publisher=Little, Brown|location=Boston|year=1993|page=114|isbn=0-316-09134-0|oclc=|doi=|accessdate=}}</ref>}} . 

The extermination camps were run by SS officers, but most of the guards were Ukrainian or Baltic auxiliaries. Regular German soldiers were kept well away.  . 

====Gas chambers====. 
At the extermination camps with gas chambers all the prisoners arrived by train. Sometimes entire trainloads were sent straight to the gas chambers, but usually the camp doctor on duty subjected individuals to selections, where a small percentage were deemed fit to work in the slave labor camps; the majority were taken directly from the platforms to a reception area where all their clothes and other possessions were seized by the Nazis to help fund the war. They were then herded naked into the gas chambers. Usually they were told these were showers or delousing chambers, and there were signs outside saying "baths" and "sauna." They were sometimes given a small piece of soap and a towel so as to avoid panic, and were told to remember where they had put their belongings for the same reason. When they asked for water because they were thirsty after the long journey in the cattle trains, they were told to hurry up, because coffee was waiting for them in the camp, and it was getting cold. <ref name=Piper173>{{cite book|author=[[Franciszek Piper|Piper, Franciszek]] in Berenbaum, Michael & Gutman, Yisrael (Eds.)|title=Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|location=Bloomington|year=1998|page=173|isbn=0-253-20884-X|oclc=|doi=|accessdate=}}</ref> .

The gas was then pumped out, the bodies were removed (which would take up to four hours), gold fillings in their teeth were extracted with pliers by dentist prisoners, and women's hair was cut. <ref>Piper, Franciszek.

Höß said that only women's hair was cut and only after they were dead. He said he had first received the order to do this in 1943. </ref> The floor of the gas chamber was cleaned, and the walls whitewashed. <ref name=Piper163/> The work was done by the ''[[Sonderkommando]],'' which were work units of Jewish prisoners. In crematoria 1 and 2, the ''Sonderkommando'' lived in an attic above the crematoria; in crematoria 3 and 4, they lived inside the gas chambers. <ref name=Piper172>Piper, Franciszek.

At first, the bodies were buried in deep pits and covered with lime, but between September and November 1942, on the orders of Himmler, they were dug up and burned. In the spring of 1943, new gas chambers and crematoria were built to accommodate the numbers. <ref name=Piper164>Piper, Franciszek.

{{quotation|Another improvement we made over Treblinka was that we built our gas chambers to accommodate 2,000 people at one time, whereas at Treblinka their 10 gas chambers only accommodated 200 people each. The way we selected our victims was as follows: we had two SS doctors on duty at Auschwitz to examine the incoming transports of prisoners. The prisoners would be marched by one of the doctors who would make spot decisions as they walked by. Those who were fit for work were sent into the Camp. Others were sent immediately to the extermination plants. Children of tender years were invariably exterminated, since by reason of their youth they were unable to work. Still another improvement we made over Treblinka was that at Treblinka the victims almost always knew that they were to be exterminated and at Auschwitz we endeavored to fool the victims into thinking that they were to go through a delousing process. Of course, frequently they realized our true intentions and we sometimes had riots and difficulties due to that fact. Very frequently women would hide their children under the clothes but of course when we found them we would send the children in to be exterminated. We were required to carry out these exterminations in secrecy but of course the foul and nauseating stench from the continuous burning of bodies permeated the entire area and all of the people living in the surrounding communities knew that exterminations were going on at Auschwitz.|[[Rudolf Höß]], Auschwitz camp commandant, Nuremberg testimony. <ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1946Hoess.html Modern History Sourcebook: Rudolf Höß, Commandant of Auschwitz: Testimony at Nuremberg, 1946] Accessed May 6, 2007</ref>}} .

{{Quotation|In every ghetto, in every deportation train, in every labor camp, even in the death camps, the will to resist was strong, and took many forms. Fighting with the few weapons that would be found, individual acts of defiance and protest, the courage of obtaining food and water under the threat of death, the superiority of refusing to allow the Germans their final wish to gloat over panic and despair.  . 

Even passivity was a form of resistance. To die with dignity was a form of resistance. To resist the demoralizing, brutalizing force of evil, to refuse to be reduced to the level of animals, to live through the torment, to outlive the tormentors, these too were acts of resistance. Merely to give a witness of these events in testimony was, in the end, a contribution to victory. Simply to survive was a victory of the human spirit."|[[Martin Gilbert]]. ''The Holocaust: The Jewish Tragedy''. <ref>Gilbert, Martin. ''The Holocaust: The Jewish Tragedy''. London: St. Edmundsbury Press 1986. </ref>}} . 

There are many examples of Jewish resistance, most notably the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] of January 1943, when thousands of poorly armed Jewish fighters held the SS at bay for four weeks before being crushed by overwhelmingly superior forces. According to Jewish accounts, several hundred Germans were killed, while the Germans claimed to have lost 17 dead and 93 wounded. 13,000 Jews were killed during the uprising, and 57,885 were deported and gassed according to German figures. This uprising was followed by the uprising in the Treblinka extermination camp in May 1943, when about 200 inmates escaped from the camp after overpowering the guards. They killed a number of German guards and set the camp buildings ablaze, but 900 inmates were also killed, and out of the 600 who successfully escaped, only 40 survived the war. Two weeks later, there was an uprising in the [[Białystok]] ghetto. In September, there was a short-lived uprising in the [[Vilnius]] ghetto. In October, 600 Jewish prisoners, including Jewish Soviet prisoners of war, attempted an escape at the Sobibor death camp. The prisoners killed 11 German [[SS]] officers and a number of camp guards. However, the killings were discovered, and the inmates were forced to run for their lives under heavy fire. 300 of the prisoners were killed during the escape. Most of the survivors either died in the minefields surrounding the camp or were recaptured and executed. About 60 survived and joined the Soviet partisans. On October 7, 1944, 250 Jewish ''[[Sonderkommando]]s'' (laborers) at Auschwitz attacked their guards and blew up Crematorium IV with explosives female prisoners had smuggled in from a nearby factory. Three German guards were killed during the uprising, one of whom was stuffed into an oven. The Sonderkommandos attempted a mass breakout, but all 250 were killed soon after.  . 

An estimated 20,000 to 30,000 [[Jewish partisans]] (see the list at the top of this section) actively fought the Nazis and their collaborators in Eastern Europe. <ref>David M. Kennedy (2007).

In occupied Poland and Soviet territories, thousands of Jews fled into the swamps or forests and joined the partisans, although the partisan movements did not always welcome them. In Lithuania and Belarus, an area with a heavy concentration of Jews, and also an area which suited partisan operations, Jewish partisan groups saved thousands of Jewish civilians from extermination. No such opportunities existed for the Jewish populations of cities such as [[Budapest]]. However in [[Amsterdam]], and other parts of the Netherlands, many Jews were active in the [[Dutch Resistance]]. <ref>Klempner, Mark. ''The Heart Has Reasons: Holocaust Rescuers and Their Stories of Courage'', The Pilgrim Press, 2006, pp. 145–146. </ref> [[Timothy Snyder]] wrote that "Other combatants in the [[Warsaw Uprising]] were veterans of the ghetto uprising of 1943. Most of these Jews joined the [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]]; others found the [[Armia Ludowa|People's Army]], or even the anti-Semitic [[National Armed Forces]]. Some Jews (or Poles of Jewish origin) were already enlisted in the Home Army and the People's Army. Almost certainly, more Jews fought in the Warsaw Uprising of August 1944 than in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of April 1943."<ref>Timothy Snyder.

ISBN 0-465-00239-0</ref> Joining the partisans was an option only for the young and the fit who were willing to leave their families. Many Jewish families preferred to die together rather than be separated.  . 

[[France|French]] Jews were also highly active in the [[French Resistance]], which conducted a massive guerilla campaign against the Nazis and Vichy French authorities, assisted the Allies in their sweep across France, and supported Allied including [[Free French Forces|Free French]] forces in the liberation of many occupied French cities. Although Jews made up only one percent of the French population, they made up fifteen to twenty percent of the French Resistance. <ref>Schul (1967), pp. 181–3</ref> The Jewish youth movement EEIF, which had originally shown support for the Vichy regime, was banned in 1943, and many of its older members formed armed resistance units. [[Zionism|Zionist]] Jews also formed the [[Armee Juive]] (Jewish Army), which participated in armed resistance under a Zionist flag, and smuggled Jews out of the country. Both organizations merged in 1944, and participated in the liberation of [[Paris]], [[Lyon]], [[Toulouse]], [[Grenoble]], and [[Nice]]. <ref>Susan Zuccotti, ''The Holocaust, the French, and the Jews''.

For the great majority of Jews resistance could take only the passive forms of delay, evasion, negotiation, bargaining and, where possible, bribery of German officials. The Nazis encouraged this by forcing the Jewish communities to police themselves, through bodies such as the [[Reich Association of Jews]] (''Reichsvereinigung der Juden'') in Germany and the Jewish Councils ''([[Judenrat|Judenräte]]'') in the urban ghettos in occupied Poland. They held out the promise of concessions in exchange for each surrender, enmeshing the Jewish leadership so deeply in well-intentioned compromise that a decision to stand and fight was never possible. Holocaust survivor Alexander Kimel wrote: "The youth in the Ghettos dreamed about fighting. I believe that although there were many factors that inhibited our responses, the most important factors were isolation and historical conditioning to accepting martyrdom."<ref>Kimel, Alexander. [http://www.kimel.net/resistance3.html "Holocaust Resistance"], accessed May 4, 2007. </ref> . 

The historical conditioning of the Jewish communities of Europe to accept persecution and avert disaster through compromise and negotiation was the most important factor in the failure to resist until the very end. The Warsaw Ghetto uprising took place only when the Jewish population had been reduced from 500,000 to 100,000, and it was obvious that no further compromise was possible. [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] writes: "The Jews had been persecuted for a millennium and a half and had learned from long experience that resistance cost lives rather than saved them. Their history, their theology, their folklore, their social structure, even their vocabulary trained them to negotiate, to pay, to plead, to protest, not to fight."<ref>Johnson, Paul. ''A History of the Jews'', Harper Perennial, 1988, p. 506. </ref> . 

The Jewish communities were also systematically deceived about German intentions, and were cut off from most sources of news from the outside world. The Germans told the Jews that they were being deported to work camps{{spaced ndash}}euphemistically calling it "resettlement in the East"{{spaced ndash}}and maintained this illusion through elaborate deceptions all the way to the gas chamber doors (which were marked with labels stating that the chambers were for removal of lice) to avoid uprisings. As photographs testify, Jews disembarked at the railway stations at Auschwitz and other extermination camps carrying sacks and suitcases, clearly having no idea of the fate that awaited them. Rumours of the reality of the extermination camps filtered back only slowly to the ghettos, and were usually not believed, just as they were not believed when couriers such as [[Jan Karski]], the Polish resistance fighter, conveyed them to the western Allies. <ref>Wood, Thomas E. & Jankowski, Stanisław M.

===Climax===. 
{{refimprove section|date=June 2011}}
Heydrich was assassinated in [[Prague]] in June 1942. He was succeeded as head of the RSHA by [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]]. Kaltenbrunner and Eichmann, under Himmler's close supervision, oversaw the climax of the Final Solution. During 1943 and 1944, the extermination camps worked at a furious rate to kill the hundreds of thousands of people shipped to them by rail from almost every country within the German sphere of influence. By the spring of 1944, up to 8,000 people were being gassed every day at [[Auschwitz]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10007327|title=Killing Centers|publisher=USHMM}}</ref> . 

Despite the high productivity of the war industries based in the Jewish ghettos in the General Government, during 1943 they were liquidated, and their populations shipped to the camps for extermination. The largest of these operations, the deportation of 100,000 people from the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] in early 1943, provoked the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]], which was suppressed with great brutality. Approximately 42,000 Jews were shot during the [[Operation Harvest Festival]] on November 3–4, 1943. <ref>[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005222 Aktion "Erntefest" (Operation "Harvest Festival")], ''Holocaust Encyclopedia'', United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington, D.C. </ref> At the same time, rail shipments arrived regularly from western and southern Europe. Few Jews were shipped from the occupied Soviet territories to the camps: the killing of Jews in this zone was left in the hands of the SS, aided by locally recruited auxiliaries. In any case, by the end of 1943 the Germans had been driven from most Soviet territory.  . 

Shipments of Jews to the camps had priority on the German railways, and continued even in the face of the increasingly dire military situation after the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] at the end of 1942 and the escalating Allied air attacks on German industry and transport. Army leaders and economic managers complained at this diversion of resources and at the killing of irreplaceable skilled Jewish workers. By 1944, moreover, it was evident to most Germans not blinded by Nazi fanaticism that Germany was losing the war. Many senior officials began to fear the retribution that might await Germany and them personally for the crimes being committed in their name. But the power of Himmler and the SS within the German Reich was too great to resist, and Himmler could always evoke Hitler's authority for his demands. 
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-680-8285A-08, Budapest, Festnahme von Juden.jpg|thumb|Budapest, Hungary – Captured Jewish women in Wesselényi Street, October 20–22, 1944]]

In October 1943, Himmler gave a speech to senior Nazi Party officials gathered in Posen (now [[Poznań]] in western Poland). Here he came closer than ever before to stating explicitly that he was intent on exterminating the Jews of Europe: . 

{{Quotation|I may here in this closest of circles allude to a question which you, my party comrades, have all taken for granted, but which has become for me the most difficult question of my life, the Jewish question ... I ask of you that what I say in this circle you really only hear and never speak of ... We come to the question: how is it with the women and children? I have resolved even here on a completely clear solution. I do not consider myself justified in eradicating the men—so to speak killing them or ordering them to be killed—and allowing the avengers in the shape of the children to grow up ... The difficult decision had to be taken, to cause this people to disappear from the earth.}} . 

The audience for this speech included Admiral [[Karl Dönitz]] and Armaments Minister [[Albert Speer]], both of whom successfully claimed at the [[Nuremberg trials]] that they had had no knowledge of the Final Solution. The text of this speech was not known at the time of their trials.  . 

The scale of extermination slackened somewhat at the beginning of 1944 once the ghettos in occupied Poland were emptied, but on March 19, 1944, Hitler ordered the [[Operation Margarethe|military occupation of Hungary]], and Eichmann was dispatched to [[Budapest]] to supervise the deportation of Hungary's 800,000 Jews. Hitler had personally complained to the Hungarian regent Admiral [[Miklós Horthy]] on the previous day, March 18, 1944, that:
{{Quotation|Hungary did nothing in the matter of the Jewish problem, and was not prepared to settle accounts with the large Jewish population in Hungary. <ref>quoted in Richard J. Evans, Lying About Hitler: History, Holocaust, and the David Irving Trial, (New York: Basic Books), p.92</ref>}}
More than half of them were shipped to Auschwitz in the course of the year. The commandant, Rudolf Höß, said at his trial that he killed 400,000 Hungarian Jews in three months.  . 

===="Blood for Goods"====. 
The operation to kill Hungarian Jews met strong opposition within the Nazi hierarchy, and there were some suggestions that Hitler should offer the Allies a deal where they would be spared in exchange for a favorable peace settlement. There were unofficial negotiations in [[Istanbul]] between Himmler's agents, British agents, and representatives of Jewish organizations; at one point an attempt by Eichmann to exchange one million Jews for 10,000 trucks—the so-called "[[blood for goods]]" proposal—but there was no real possibility of such a deal being struck.  .

In February 1942, an escaped inmate from the [[Chełmno extermination camp]], Jacob Grojanowski, reached the Warsaw Ghetto, where he gave detailed information about the Chełmno camp to the [[Oyneg Shabbos (group)|Oneg Shabbat]] group. His report, which became known as the [[Grojanowski Report]], was smuggled out of the ghetto through the channels of the Polish underground to the [[Delegatura Sił Zbrojnych na Kraj|Delegatura]], and reached London by June 1942.

News about gassing Jews was also published in illegal newspapers of the [[Dutch resistance]], like in the issue of [[Het Parool]] of September 27, 1943. However, the news was so unbelievable that many assumed it was merely war propaganda. The publications were halted because they were counter-productive for the Dutch resistance. Nevertheless, many Jews were warned that they would be murdered, but as escape was impossible for most of them, they preferred to believe that the warnings were false. <ref>Het Parool, September 27, page 4–5.

[[File:Pilecki ausch f.jpg|thumb|Auschwitz concentration camp photos of Pilecki (1941)]]
In September 1940, Captain [[Witold Pilecki]], a member of the Polish underground and a soldier of the [[Home Army]], worked out a plan to enter Auschwitz and volunteered to be sent there, the only known person to volunteer to be imprisoned at Auschwitz. He organized an underground network [[Związek Organizacji Wojskowej]] (''translation: "Union of Military Organizations"'') that was ready to initiate an uprising but it was decided that the probability of success was too low for the uprising to succeed. UMO's numerous and detailed reports became later a principal source of intelligence on Auschwitz for the Western Allies. Pilecki escaped from Auschwitz with information that became the basis of a two-part report in August 1943 that was sent to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in London. The report included details about the gas chambers, about "selection", and about the sterilization experiments. It stated that there were three crematoria in Birkenau able to burn 10,000 people daily, and that 30,000 people had been gassed in one day. The author wrote: "History knows no parallel of such destruction of human life." [[Raul Hilberg]] writes that the report was filed away with a note that there was no indication as to the reliability of the source. <ref name=Hilberg1212>{{cite book|author=[[Raul Hilberg|Hilberg, Raul]]|title=The destruction of the European Jews|publisher=Holmes & Meier|location=New York|year=1985|page=1212|isbn=0-8419-0910-5|oclc=|doi=}}</ref> When Pilecki returned to Poland after the war the communist authorities [[Pilecki#Arrest and execution|arrested and accused him of spying]] for the [[Polish government in exile]]. He was sentenced to death in a show trial and was executed on May 25, 1948.  . 

Before Pilecki escaped from Auschwitz the most spectacular escape took place on June 20, 1942, when Ukrainian [[Eugeniusz Bendera]] and three Poles, [[Kazimierz Piechowski]], [[Stanisław Gustaw Jaster]] and [[Józef Lempart]] made a daring escape. <ref>"Byłem Numerem: swiadectwa Z Auschwitz" by Kazimierz Piechowski, Eugenia Bozena Kodecka-Kaczynska, Michal Ziokowski, Hardcover, Wydawn.

They drove out the main gate in a stolen [[Rudolf Hoss]] automobile [[Steyr automobile|Steyr]] 220 with a smuggled first report from [[Witold Pilecki]] to [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance]] about the Holocaust. The Germans never recaptured any of them. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.auschwitz.org.pl/m/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=578&Itemid=8|title=Auschwitz-Birkenau – The Film about the Amazing Escape from Auschwitz—Now Available on DVD|publisher=En.auschwitz.org.pl|date=January 13, 2009|accessdate=July 31, 2010}}</ref> . 

[[Rudolf Vrba]] and [[Alfred Wetzler]], Jewish inmates, escaped from Auschwitz in April 1944, eventually reaching [[Slovakia]]. The 32-page document they dictated to Jewish officials about the mass murder at Auschwitz became known as the [[Vrba-Wetzler report]]. Vrba had an [[eidetic memory]] and had worked on the ''Judenrampe'', where Jews disembarked from the trains to be "selected" either for the gas chamber or slave labor. The level of detail with which he described the transports allowed Slovakian officials to compare his account with their own deportation records, and the corroboration convinced the Allies to take the report seriously. <ref name=ConwayWiesenthal/><ref name=Vbra>{{cite book|author=[[Rudolf Vrba|Vrba, Rudolf]]|title=I Escaped From Auschwitz|publisher=Barricade Books|location=New York|year=2002|pages=|isbn=1-56980-232-7|oclc=|doi=}}</ref> . 

Two other Auschwitz inmates, Arnost Rosin and Czesław Mordowicz escaped on May 27, 1944, arriving in Slovakia on June 6, the day of the [[Normandy Landings|Normandy landing]] ([[D-Day]]). Hearing about Normandy, they believed the war was over and got drunk to celebrate, using dollars they'd smuggled out of the camp. They were arrested for violating currency laws, and spent eight days in prison, before the ''[[Judenrat]]'' paid their fines. The additional information they offered the Judenrat was added to Vrba and Wetzler's report and became known as the Auschwitz Protocols.

===Death marches (1944–1945)===. 
{{main|Death marches (Holocaust)}} . 

By mid 1944, the Final Solution had largely run its course. Those Jewish communities within easy reach of the Nazi regime had been largely exterminated, in proportions ranging from about 25 percent in France to more than 90 percent in Poland. In May, Himmler claimed in a speech that "The Jewish question in Germany and the occupied countries has been solved."<ref>[http://www.archives.gov/research/captured-german-records/sound-recordings.html "Captured German sound recordings"], The National Archives. </ref> During 1944, in any case, the task became steadily more difficult. German armies were evicted from the Soviet Union, the Balkans and Italy, and German allies were either defeated or were switching sides to the Allies. In June, the western Allies landed in France. Allied air attacks and the operations of partisans made rail transport increasingly difficult, and the objections of the military to the diversion of rail transport for carrying Jews to Poland more urgent and harder to ignore.  . 

At this time, as the Soviet armed forces approached, the camps in eastern Poland were closed down, any surviving inmates being shipped west to camps closer to Germany, first to Auschwitz and later to [[Gross Rosen]] in [[Silesia]]. Auschwitz itself was closed as the Soviets advanced through Poland. The last 13 prisoners, all women, were killed in Auschwitz II on November 25, 1944; records show they were "''unmittelbar getötet''" ("killed outright"),<!--see footnote for the full German--> leaving open whether they were gassed or otherwise disposed of. <ref name=isbn3-498-00884-6>{{cite book|author=Czech, Danuta|title=Kalendarium der Ereignisse im Konzentrationslager Auschwitz- Birkenau 1939–1945.|publisher=Rowohlt, Reinbek|location=|year=1989|pages= 920, 933|isbn=3-498-00884-6|oclc=|doi=}} using information from a series called ''Hefte von Auschwitz'', and cited in Kárný, Miroslav.

November Im KL Auschwitz II kommen 24 weibliche Häftlinge ums Leben, von denen 13 unmittelbar getötet werden."</ref> . 

Despite the desperate military situation, great efforts were made to conceal evidence of what had happened in the camps. The gas chambers were dismantled, the crematoria dynamited, mass graves dug up and the corpses cremated, and Polish farmers were induced to plant crops on the sites to give the impression that they had never existed. Local commanders continued to kill Jews, and to shuttle them from camp to camp by forced "death marches" until the last weeks of the war. <ref>[http://www.ushmm.org/uia-cgi/uia_query Maps of the main death marches], United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. </ref> . 

Already sick after months or years of violence and starvation, prisoners were forced to march for tens of miles in the snow to train stations; then transported for days at a time without food or shelter in freight trains with open carriages; and forced to march again at the other end to the new camp. Those who lagged behind or fell were shot. Around 250,000 Jews died during these marches. <ref>{{cite book|author=Friedländer, Saul|title=Nazi Germany and the Jews: The Years of Extermination|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|year=2007|pages=|isbn=0-06-019043-4|oclc=|doi=}} p. 649</ref> . 

The largest and best-known of the death marches took place in January 1945, when the Soviet army advanced on Poland. Nine days before the Soviets arrived at Auschwitz, the SS marched 60,000 prisoners out of the camp toward Wodzislaw, {{convert|56|km|mi|abbr=on}} away, where they were put on freight trains to other camps. Around 15,000 died on the way. [[Elie Wiesel]] and his father, Shlomo, were among the marchers: . 

{{Quotation|An icy wind blew in violent gusts. But we marched without faltering. <br><br>Pitch darkness. Every now and then, an explosion in the night.

The living lay with their heads against the corpses and around them moved the awful, ghostly procession of emaciated, aimless people, with nothing to do and with no hope of life, unable to move out of your way, unable to look at the terrible sights around them ... Babies had been born here, tiny wizened things that could not live ... A mother, driven mad, screamed at a British sentry to give her milk for her child, and thrust the tiny mite into his arms ... He opened the bundle and found the baby had been dead for days. This day at Belsen was the most horrible of my life.}} .

The number of victims depends on which definition of "the Holocaust" is used. Donald Niewyk and Francis Nicosia write in ''The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust'' that the term is commonly defined<ref name=Niewyk45/> as the mass murder, and attempt to wipe out, European Jewry, which would bring the total number of victims to just under six million—around 78 percent of the 7.3 million Jews in occupied Europe at the time. <ref name=Gilbert242>[[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, Martin]]. ''Atlas of the Holocaust'', 1988, pp. 242–244. </ref> . 

Broader definitions include approximately 2 to 3 million Soviet POWs, 2 million ethnic Poles, up to 1,500,000 Romani, 200,000 handicapped, political and religious dissenters, 15,000 homosexuals and 5,000 Jehovah's Witnesses, bringing the death toll to around 11 million. The broadest definition would include 6 million Soviet civilians, raising the death toll to 17 million. <ref name=Niewyk45>Niewyk, Donald L. and Nicosia, Francis R.

===Jewish===. 
Since 1945, the most commonly cited figure for the total number of Jews killed has been six million. The [[Yad Vashem]] Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority in [[Jerusalem]], writes that there is no precise figure for the number of Jews killed. The figure most commonly used is the six million attributed to Adolf Eichmann, a senior SS official. <ref>[[Wilhelm Höttl]], an [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officer and a Doctor of History, testified at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] and Eichmann's trial that at a meeting he had with Eichmann in Budapest in late August 1944, "Eichmann ... told me that, according to his information, some 6,000,000 (six million) Jews had perished until then – 4,000,000 (four million) in extermination camps and the remaining 2,000,000 (two million) through shooting by the Operations Units and other causes, such as disease, etc."[http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/Testimony-Abroad/Wilhelm_Hoettl-07.html][http://david-kahn.com/articles-secret-history-author-front.htm][http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/imt/tgmwc/tgmwc-02/tgmwc-02-20-05.shtml]</ref> Early calculations range from 5.1 million from [[Raul Hilberg]], to 5.95 million from Jacob Leschinsky.

Hilberg's estimate of 5.1 million, in the third edition of ''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]'', includes over 800,000 who died from "ghettoization and general privation"; 1,400,000 killed in open-air shootings; and up to 2,900,000 who perished in camps. Hilberg estimates the death toll of Jews in Poland as up to 3,000,000. <ref>Hilberg, Raul. ''The Destruction of the European Jews''. Yale University Press, 2003, c. 1961). </ref> Hilberg's numbers are generally considered to be a conservative estimate, as they typically include only those deaths for which records are available, avoiding statistical adjustment. <ref name=isbn0-253-20884-X>{{cite book|author=Gutman, Yisrael.

[[British people|British]] historian [[Martin Gilbert]] arrived at a "minimum estimate" of over 5.75 million Jewish victims. <ref name=isbn0415281458>{{cite book|author=Martin Gilbert|title=The Routledge atlas of the Holocaust, 3rd Ed.|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London|year=2002|pages=|isbn=0-415-28145-8|oclc=|doi=|page=245|quote=By the most exact estimates of recent research, the number of Jews killed in Europe between September 1939 and May 1945 was nearly six million.

There were about 8 to 10 million Jews in the territories controlled directly or indirectly by the Nazis (the uncertainty arises from the lack of knowledge about how many Jews there were in the Soviet Union). The six million killed in the Holocaust thus represent 60 to 75 percent of these Jews. Of Poland's 3.3 million Jews, over 90 percent were killed. The same proportion were killed in [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]], but most of [[Estonia]]'s Jews were evacuated in time. Of the 750,000 Jews in Germany and Austria in 1933, only about a quarter survived. Although many German Jews emigrated before 1939, the majority of these fled to [[Czechoslovakia]], France or the Netherlands, from where they were later deported to their deaths. In Czechoslovakia, Greece, the Netherlands, and Yugoslavia, over 70 percent were killed. 50 to 70 percent were killed in [[Romania]], Belgium and Hungary. It is likely that a similar proportion were killed in [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]], but these figures are less certain. Countries with notably lower proportions of deaths include [[Bulgaria]], Denmark, France, Italy, and [[Shoah in Norway|Norway]]. Albania was the only country occupied by the Nazis that had a significantly larger Jewish population in 1945 than in 1939. About two hundred native Jews and over a thousand refugees were provided with false documents, hidden when necessary, and generally treated as honored guests in a country whose population was roughly 60% Muslim. <ref>Shoah Research Center;– Albania [http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%205725.pdf] The Jews of Albania during the Zogist and Second World War Periods [http://www.heimat.de/home/illyria/i.php3?s=e&p=2004_01_09_fisher_jews_in_albania] and see also Norman H.

This gives a total of over 3.8 million; of these, 80–90% were estimated to be Jews. These seven camps thus accounted for half the total number of Jews killed in the entire Nazi Holocaust. Virtually the entire Jewish population of Poland died in these camps. <ref name=autogenerated2/> . 

In addition to those who died in the above extermination camps, at least half a million Jews died in other camps, including the major concentration camps in Germany. These were not extermination camps, but had large numbers of Jewish prisoners at various times, particularly in the last year of the war as the Nazis withdrew from Poland. About a million people died in these camps, and although the proportion of Jews is not known with certainty, it was estimated to be at least 50 percent.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009|reason=need sourcing for concentration camps and Einsatzgruppen killing estimates}} Another 800,000 to one million Jews were killed by the ''Einsatzgruppen'' in the occupied Soviet territories (an approximate figure, since the ''Einsatzgruppen'' killings were frequently undocumented). <ref name=isbn0-375-40900-9>{{cite book|author=Rhodes, Richard|title=Masters of death: the SS-Einsatzgruppen and the invention of the Holocaust|publisher=Alfred A.

[[File:Pinkasova synagoga, jména obětí.jpg|thumb|170px|The names of 77,297 Czech Jews who died in the Holocaust. Pinkas Synagogue in Prague.]]
In the 1990s, the opening of government archives in Eastern Europe resulted in the adjustment of the death tolls published in the pioneering work by Hilberg, Dawidowicz and Gilbert (e.g. compare Gilbert's estimation of 2 million deaths in Auschwitz-Birkenau with the updated figure of 1 million in the Extermination Camp data box). As pointed out above, Wolfgang Benz has been carrying out work on the more recent data. He concluded in 1999: . 

<blockquote>"The goal of annihilating all of the Jews of Europe, as it was proclaimed at the conference in the villa Am Grossen Wannsee in January 1942, was not reached. Yet the six million murder victims make the holocaust a unique crime in the history of mankind. The number of victims—and with certainty the following represent the minimum number in each case—cannot express that adequately. Numbers are just too abstract. However they must be stated in order to make clear the dimension of the genocide: 165,000 Jews from Germany, 65,000 from Austria, 32,000 from France and Belgium, more than 100,000 from the Netherlands, 60,000 from Greece, the same number from Yugoslavia, more than 140,000 from Czechoslovakia, half a million from Hungary, 2.2 million from the Soviet Union, and 2.7 million from Poland. To these numbers must be added all those killed in the pogroms and massacres in Romania and Transitrien (over 200,000) and the deported and murdered Jews from Albania and Norway, Denmark and Italy, from Luxembourg and Bulgaria."<ref>{{cite book |author=Benz, Wolfgang |title=The Holocaust: a German historian examines the genocide |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |year=1999 |pages= |isbn=0-231-11214-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}pp. 152–153</ref></blockquote> . 

=====Effect on Yiddish speaking population of Europe=====. 
As the significant majority of the Jewish victims of the Holocaust were speakers of [[Yiddish]], the Holocaust had a profound and permanent effect on the fate of Yiddish language and culture (see [[Yiddish Renaissance]]). On the eve of [[World War II]], there were 11 to 13 million Yiddish speakers in the world. <ref>Jacobs, Neil G. ''Yiddish: a Linguistic Introduction'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2005, ISBN 0-521-77215-X. </ref> The Holocaust, however, led to a dramatic, sudden decline in the use of Yiddish, as the extensive Jewish communities, both secular and religious, that used Yiddish in their day-to-day life were largely destroyed. Around 5 million, or 85%, of the victims of the Holocaust, were speakers of Yiddish. <ref>[[Solomon Birnbaum|Solomo Birnbaum]], ''Grammatik der jiddischen Sprache'' (4., erg. Aufl., Hamburg: Buske, 1984), p. 3. </ref> Of the remaining non-Yiddish population, the [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]] speaking populations of Greece and the Balkans were also destroyed, which contributed to the extinction of this ''Judaeo-Spanish'' language.  . 

===Non Jewish===. 
====Slavs====. 
{{main|Generalplan Ost|Hunger Plan}}
One of Hitler's ambitions at the start of the war was to exterminate, expel, or enslave most or all [[Slav]]s from their native lands so as to make [[Lebensraum|living space]] for German settlers. This plan of genocide<ref>Dietrich Eichholtz "»Generalplan Ost« zur Versklavung

German Nazi planners had in November 1939 called for "the complete destruction" of all Poles. <ref name=BackingHitler>{{cite book|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=153–154|last=Gellately|first=Robert|title=Backing Hitler: Consent and Coercion in Nazi Germany|year=2001|quote=German planners in November 1939 called for nothing less than ‘the complete destruction’ of the Polish people. [...] Later versions of the ‘General Plan East’ grew more expansive, and envisioned serial genocide and the death or deportation of the 30 to 40 million ‘racially undesirable’ peoples like the Poles and Jews from the area to be colonized in the east. A second group of about 14 million, mainly Slavs, would stay to be used as slaves. Germans and others from ‘Germanic nations’, like the Norwegians and the Dutch, would settle the new territory.}}</ref> "All Poles", Heinrich Himmler swore, "will disappear from the world". The Polish state under German occupation was to be cleared of ethnic Poles and settled by German colonists. <ref name=Volk>{{cite journal|first=Volker R.|last=Berghahn|title=Germans and Poles 1871–1945|journal=Germany and Eastern Europe: Cultural Identities and Cultural Differences|publisher=Rodopi|year=1999}}</ref> Of the Poles, by 1952 only about 3–4 million of them were to be left in the former Poland, and only to serve as slaves for German settlers. They were to be forbidden to marry, the existing ban on any medical help to Poles in Germany would be extended, and eventually Poles would cease to exist. On August 22, 1939, about one week before the onset of the war, Hitler had "prepared, for the moment only in the East, my '[[SS-Totenkopfverbände|Death's Head]]' formations with orders to kill without pity or mercy all men, women and children of Polish descent or [[Polish language|language]].

The actions taken against ethnic Poles were not on the scale of the genocide of the Jews. Most Polish Jews (perhaps 90% of their antebellum population) perished during the Holocaust, while most Christian Poles survived the brutal German occupation. <ref>[[Israel Gutman]], ''Unequal Victims'' Holocaust Library 1985</ref> Between 1.8 and 2.1 million non-Jewish Polish citizens perished in German hands during the course of the war, about four-fifths of whom were ethnic [[Poles]] with the remaining fifth being ethnic minorities of [[Ukrainians]] and [[Belarusians]], the vast majority of them civilians. <ref name=autogenerated1/><ref name=PolandWorldWarIIcasualties>Piotrowski, Tadeusz.

A few days before the invasion of Poland, on August 22, 1939, [[Adolf Hitler]] said to his generals: . 

{{quotation|Genghis Khan led millions of women and children to slaughter—with premeditation and a happy heart. History sees in him solely the founder of a state. ... Our war aim does not consist in reaching certain lines, but in the physical destruction of the enemy. Accordingly, I have placed my death-head formations in readiness—for the present only in the East—with orders to them to send to death mercilessly and without compassion, men, women, and children of Polish derivation and language. Only thus shall we gain the living space (''Lebensraum'') which we need. Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians? ... Poland will be depopulated and settled with Germans. ...

=====Ethnic Slovenes=====. 
After the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, [[Slovenia]] was occupied by German [[Nazis]], Italian [[Italian_Fascism#Nationalism.2C_Empire_and_Italianization|Fascists]] and their [[Hungary during World War II|Hungarian]] collaborators. On February 25, 1942, two days after [[Italian Fascist]] regime established [[Gonars concentration camp]], and the first transport of 5,343 internees (1,643 of whom were children) arrived from the [[Province of Ljubljana]] and from the [[Rab concentration camp]] and the camp in Monigo near Treviso.

In Belarus, Nazi Germany imposed a regime in the country that was responsible for burning down some 9,000 villages, deporting some 380,000 people for slave labour, and killing hundreds of thousands of civilians. More than 600 villages, like [[Khatyn]], were burned along with their entire population and at least 5,295 Belarusian settlements were destroyed by the Nazis and some or all of their inhabitants killed. Altogether, 1,670,000 civilians (18 percent of the population) were killed during the three years of German occupation,<ref>Vadim Erlikman. ''Poteri narodonaseleniia v XX veke: spravochnik''.

Hitler's racial policy with regard to the Slavs, to the extent that it was formulated, was "depopulation."

=====Soviet POWs=====. 
{{main|Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs}}
According to [[Michael Berenbaum]], between two and three million Soviet prisoners-of-war—or around 57 percent of all Soviet POWs—died of starvation, mistreatment, or executions between June 1941 and May 1945, and most those during their first year of captivity. According to other estimates by [[Daniel Goldhagen]], an estimated 2.8 million Soviet POWs died in eight months in 1941–42, with a total of 3.5 million by mid-1944. <ref>{{cite web|title=Soviet Prisoners of war|url=http://www.gendercide.org/case_soviet.html}}</ref> The [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|USHMM]] has estimated that 3.3 million of the 5.7 million Soviet [[POW]]s died in German custody—compared to 8,300 of 231,000 British and American prisoners. <ref>{{cite web|title=Nazi persecution of Soviet Prisoners of War|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10007178}}</ref> The death rates decreased as the POWs were needed to work as slaves to help the German war effort; by 1943, half a million of them had been deployed as [[slave labor]]. <ref name=Berenbaum125/> .

The treatment of Romanis was not consistent in the different areas that Nazi Germany conquered. In some areas (e.g. Luxembourg and the Baltic countries), the Nazis killed virtually the entire Romani population. In other areas (e.g. Denmark, Greece), there is no record of Romanis being subjected to mass killings. <ref>See ''History of the Holocaust: a Handbook and a Dictionary'', Edelheit, Edelheit & Edelheit, p.458, Free Press, 1995</ref> .

Before being sent to the camps, the victims were herded into [[ghetto]]s, including several hundred into the [[Warsaw Ghetto]]. <ref name=USHMMDeportationsWarsaw>[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10005413 "Deportations to and from the Warsaw Ghetto"], United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. </ref> Further east, teams of [[Einsatzgruppen]] tracked down Romani encampments and murdered the inhabitants on the spot, leaving no records of the victims. They were also targeted by the puppet regimes that cooperated with the Nazis, e.g. the [[Ustaše]] regime in [[Croatia]], where a large number of Romani were killed in the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]]. The genocide analyst [[Helen Fein]] has stated that the Ustashe killed virtually every Romani in Croatia. <ref>Helen Fein, ''Accounting for Genocide'', New York, The Free Press, 1979, pp.79, 105</ref> . 

In May 1942, the Romani were placed under the same labor and social laws as the Jews. On December 16, 1942, Heinrich Himmler, Commander of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and regarded as the "architect" of the Nazi genocide,<ref>Breitman, Richard. ''Himmler and the Final Solution: The Architect of Genocide''. Random House, 2004. </ref> issued a decree that "Gypsy ''Mischlinge'' (mixed breeds), Romani, and members of the clans of [[Balkan]] origins who are not of German blood" should be sent to Auschwitz, unless they had served in the [[Wehrmacht]]. <ref name=BauerRoma444>Bauer, Yehuda.

This was adjusted on November 15, 1943, when Himmler ordered that, in the occupied Soviet areas, "sedentary Gypsies and part-Gypsies (''Mischlinge'') are to be treated as citizens of the country. Nomadic Gypsies and part-Gypsies are to be placed on the same level as Jews and placed in concentration camps."<ref name=BauerRoma445>Bauer, Yehuda.

{{main|Black people in Nazi Germany|Racial policy of Nazi Germany#Other "non-Aryans"}}
The number of black people in Germany when the Nazis came to power is variously estimated at 5,000–25,000. <ref>[http://www.annefrankguide.net/en-us/bronnenbank.asp?oid=15973 ''Black people in Nazi Germany''], Anne Frank Guide. </ref><ref name="voice-online1">[http://www.voice-online.co.uk/content.php?show=15123 ''The forgotten black victims of Nazi Germany''], Voice Online, Feb 16, 2009 issue 1359. </ref> It is not clear whether these figures included Asians. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington, D.C., “The fate of black people from 1933 to 1945 in Nazi Germany and in German-occupied territories ranged from isolation to persecution, sterilization, medical experimentation, incarceration, brutality, and murder. However, there was no systematic program for their elimination as there was for Jews and other groups.”<ref name="voice-online1"/> Meanwhile, [[Afrikaaners]], [[Berber people|Berber]]s, [[Iran]]ians and [[Pre-Partition India]]ns were classified as Aryans, so not persecuted (see [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany#Other "non-Aryans"|main article]]).  .

''Action T4'' was a program established in 1939 to maintain the [[gene]]tic purity of the German population by killing or [[Compulsory sterilization#Germany|sterilizing]] German and Austrian citizens who were judged to be [[disabled]] or suffering from [[mental disorder]]. <ref>[[Ian Kershaw|Kershaw, Ian]].

Despite not being formally ordered to take part, [[psychiatrist]]s and psychiatric institutions were at the center of justifying, planning and carrying out the atrocities at every stage, and "constituted the connection" to the later annihilation of Jews and other "undesirables" in the Holocaust. <ref>Rael D Strous (2007) [http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/6/1/8 Psychiatry during the Nazi era: ethical lessons for the modern professional] ''Annals of General Psychiatry'' 2007, 6:8doi:10.1186/1744-859X-6-8</ref>

{{main|Institut für Sexualwissenschaft|Pink triangle|Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust}}
[[File:ac.homomonument.jpg|thumb|The [[Homomonument]] in Amsterdam, a memorial to the homosexual victims of Nazi Germany.]]
Between 5,000 and 15,000 homosexuals of German nationality are estimated to have been sent to concentration camps. <ref name=Chronicle108/> James D. Steakley writes that what mattered in Germany was criminal intent or character, rather than criminal acts, and the ''"gesundes Volksempfinden"'' ("healthy sensibility of the people") became the leading normative legal principle. <ref name=Steakley>Steakley, James. [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/steakley-nazis.html "Homosexuals and the Third Reich"], ''The Body Politic'', Issue 11, January/February 1974. </ref> In 1936, Himmler created the "Reichszentrale zur Bekämpfung der Homosexualität und Abtreibung" ("Reich Central Office for the Combating of Homosexuality and Abortion"). <ref>{{cite book|last=Pretzel|first=Andreas|chapter=Vom Staatsfeind zum Volksfeind.

The Gestapo raided [[gay bar]]s, tracked individuals using the address books of those they arrested, used the subscription lists of gay magazines to find others, and encouraged people to report suspected homosexual behavior and to scrutinize the behavior of their neighbours. <ref name=Chronicle108/><ref name=Steakley/> . 

Tens of thousands were convicted between 1933 and 1944 and sent to camps for "rehabilitation", where they were identified by yellow armbands<ref name=EBnon-Jews>"Non-Jewish victims of Nazism", ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. </ref> and later pink triangles worn on the left side of the jacket and the right trouser leg, which singled them out for [[sexual abuse]]. <ref name=Steakley/> Hundreds were [[castration|castrated]] by [[court order]]. <ref>Giles, Geoffrey J. "The Most Unkindest Cut of All': Castration, Homosexuality and Nazi Justice", ''Journal of Contemporary History'', Vol. 27, No. 1, (January 1992): pp. 41–61. </ref> They were humiliated, tortured, used in [[hormone]] experiments conducted by SS doctors, and killed. <ref name=Chronicle108/> Steakley writes that the full extent of gay suffering was slow to emerge after the war. Many victims kept their stories to themselves because homosexuality remained criminalized in postwar Germany. Around two percent of German homosexuals were persecuted by Nazis. <ref name=Steakley/> . 

====The political left====. 
German [[Communism|communists]], [[socialist]]s and [[trade union]]ists were among the earliest domestic opponents of Nazism<ref>[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10007332 Non-Jewish Resistance], ''Holocaust Encyclopedia'', United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington, D.C. </ref> and were also among the first to be sent to concentration camps. Hitler claimed that communism was a Jewish ideology which the Nazis termed "[[Judeo-Bolshevism]]". Fear of communist agitation was used as justification for the [[Enabling Act of 1933]], the law which gave Hitler his original [[dictator]]ial powers. [[Hermann Göring]] later testified at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] that the Nazis' willingness to repress German communists prompted President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and the German elite to cooperate with the Nazis. The first concentration camp was built at Dachau, in March 1933, to imprison German communists, socialists, trade unionists and others opposed to the Nazis. <ref>"Horrors of Auschwitz", Newsquest Media Group Newspapers, January 27, 2005</ref> Communists, social democrats and other [[political prisoner]]s were forced to wear a [[Nazi concentration camp badges|red triangle]].  . 

Hitler and the Nazis also hated German [[political left|leftists]] because of their resistance to the party's racism. Many leaders of German leftist groups were Jews, and Jews were especially prominent among the leaders of the [[Spartacist uprising]] in 1919. Hitler already referred to [[Marxism]] and "[[Bolshevism]]" as a means of "the international Jew" to undermine "racial purity" and survival of the [[Nordic race|Nordics]] or Aryans, as well to stir up [[socioeconomic]] [[Social class|class]] tension and [[labor union]]s against the government or state-owned businesses. Within the concentration camps such as [[Buchenwald]], German communists were privileged in comparison to Jews because of their "racial purity". <ref>Augustine, Dolores, [http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FCCC%2FCCC41_01%2FS0008938908000241a.pdf&code=4134a8e9c304e36a6dc05fe2f918880a Book Review] of Niven, Bill, ''The Buchenwald Child: Truth, Fiction, and Propaganda'' in ''Central European History'' 41:01, Cambridge University Press</ref> . 

Whenever the Nazis occupied a new territory, members of communist, socialist, or [[anarchism|anarchist]] groups were normally to be the first persons detained or executed. Evidence of this is found in Hitler's infamous [[Commissar Order]], in which he ordered the summary execution of all political [[commissar]]s captured among Soviet soldiers, as well as the execution of all Communist Party members in German held territory. <ref>Brown, Maggie.

[[Nacht und Nebel]] (German for "Night and Fog") was a directive ({{lang-de|Erlass}}) of Hitler on December 7, 1941 signed and implemented by Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces [[Wilhelm Keitel]], resulting in [[kidnapping]] and [[Forced disappearance|disappearance]] of many political activists throughout Nazi Germany's occupied territories.  .

====Jehovah's Witnesses====. 
{{main|Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in Nazi Germany}}
Refusing to pledge allegiance to the Nazi party or to serve in the military, roughly 12,000 [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] were forced to wear a purple triangle and were placed in camps where they were given the option of renouncing their faith and submitting to the state's authority. Between 2,500 and 5,000 were killed. <ref name=Shulman/> Historian Detlef Garbe, director at the Neuengamme (Hamburg) Memorial, writes that "no other religious movement resisted the pressure to conform to National Socialism with comparable unanimity and steadfastness."<ref>''Persecution and Resistance of Jehovah's Witnesses During the Nazi-Regime 1933–1945'' ''Social Disinterest, Governmental Disinformation, Renewed Persecution, and Now Manipulation of History?'' p. 251. </ref> . 

==Uniqueness==. 
Dr. Shimon Samuels, director for International Liaison of the [[Simon Wiesenthal Centre]], describes the [[acrimonious]] debate that exists between "specifists" and "universalists". The former fear [[debasement]] of the ''Holocaust'' by [[invidious]] comparisons, while the latter places the ''Holocaust'' alongside non-Jewish experiences of mass extermination as part and parcel of the global context of [[genocide]]. Dr. Samuels considers the debate, ''[[ipso facto]]'', to dishonour the memory of the respective victims of ''each'' genocide. In his words, "Each case is specific as a threshold phenomenon, while each also adds its unique memory as signposts along an incremental continuum of horror."<ref>Dr. Simon Samuels, "Applying the Lessons of the Holocaust" in Is the Holocaust Unique? edited by Alan S.
