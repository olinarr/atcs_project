The concept of '''intangible cultural heritage (ICH)''' emerged in the 1990s, as a counterpart to the [[World Heritage]] that focuses mainly on tangible aspects of culture. In 2001, [[UNESCO]] made a survey<ref>{{cite web

==Definition== . 

Intangible culture is the counterpart of [[culture]] which is [[tangible culture|tangible]] or touchable, whereas intangible culture includes [[song]], [[music]], [[drama]], [[skill]]s, crafts, and the other parts of culture that can be recorded but cannot be touched and interacted with, without a vehicle for the culture.  These cultural vehicles are called "Human Treasures" by the [[UN]].  . 

According to the 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, the intangible cultural heritage (ICH) – or living heritage – is the mainspring of humanity's [[cultural diversity]] and its maintenance a guarantee for continuing creativity.  It is defined as follows: . 

<blockquote>Intangible Cultural Heritage means the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, skills – as well as the instruments, objects, artifacts and cultural spaces associated therewith – that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognize as part of their cultural heritage. This intangible cultural heritage, transmitted from generation to generation, is constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their interaction with nature and their history, and provides them with a sense of identity and continuity, thus promoting respect for cultural diversity and human creativity. For the purposes of this Convention, consideration will be given solely to such intangible cultural heritage as is compatible with existing international human rights instruments, as well as with the requirements of mutual respect among communities, groups and individuals, and of sustainable development. </blockquote> . 

===Oral history===. 
Intangible cultural heritage is slightly different from the discipline of [[oral history]], the recording, preservation and interpretation of historical information (specifically, [[oral tradition]]), based on the personal experiences and opinions of the speaker.  ICH attempts to preserve cultural heritage 'with' the people or community by protecting the processes that allow traditions and shared knowledge to be passed on while oral history seeks to collect and preserve historical information obtained from individuals and groups.  . 

==Oral continuity==. 
Intangible cultural heritage is passed orally within a community, and while there may be individuals who are known tradition bearers, ICH is often broader than one individual's own skills or knowledge.  A 2006 report by the government of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] said, regarding oral culture in their area, "The processes involved in the continuation of this traditional knowledge constitute one of the most interesting aspects of our living heritage. Each member of the community possesses a piece of the shared knowledge. Crucial knowledge is passed on during community activities, frequently without any conscious attention to the process. <ref>"Creative Newfoundland and Labrador: The Blueprint for Development and Investment in Culture" Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, 2006, page 34. </ref> . 

==Preservation==. 
Several countries, as well as [[UNESCO]], are making efforts to protect intangible culture. For example, following World War II, Japan enacted the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties, which designates cultural heritage sites and objects, as well as designating certain people and groups as [[Living National Treasures of Japan]], who are people that are deemed to have abilities and skills that are a critical part of Japan's national culture. <ref name=Kurin>{{cite journal|last=Kurin|first=Richard|title=Safeguarding Intangible Cultural Heritage in the 2003 UNESCO Convention: a critical appraisal|journal=Museum International|date=1 May 2004|volume=56|issue=1-2|pages=66–77|doi=10.1111/j.1350-0775.2004.00459.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1350-0775.2004.00459.x/pdf}}</ref>  Other countries, including South Korea, the Philippines, the United States, Thailand, France, Romania, the Czech Republic, and Poland, have since created similar programs. <ref name=Kurin/> . 

In 2003 UNESCO adopted the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage.  This went into effect on April 20, 2006.  The Convention recommends that countries and scholars develop inventories of ICH in their territory, as well as work with the groups who maintain these ICH to ensure their continued existences; it also provides for funds to be voluntarily collected among UNESCO members and then dispersed to support the maintenance of recognized ICH. <ref name=Kurin/> UNESCO has also created other intangible culture programs, such as a list called Proclamation of [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].  This list began in 2001 with 19 items and a further 28 were listed in 2003 and another 43 in 2005. In part, the original list was seen as a way to correct the imbalance in the World Heritage List, since it excluded many Southern Hemisphere cultures which did not produce monuments or other physical cultural manifestations. <ref name = Kurin/> It was superseded in 2008 by the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].  .
