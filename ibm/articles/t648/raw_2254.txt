'''God of the gaps''' is a type of [[Theology|theological]] perspective in which gaps in [[science|scientific]] knowledge are taken to be evidence or proof of God's existence.  The term was invented by [[Christianity|Christian]] theologians not to discredit [[theism]] but rather to discourage reliance on [[Teleological argument|teleological arguments]] for God's existence. <ref>See, e.g., "Teleological Arguments for God's Existence" in ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/teleological-arguments/#3.1]</ref> . 

==Origins of the term==. 
The term goes back to [[Henry Drummond (1851–1897)|Henry Drummond]], a 19th century [[Evangelism|evangelist]] lecturer, from his Lowell Lectures on the Ascent of Man. He chastises those [[Christian]]s who point to the things that science can not yet explain—"gaps which they will fill up with God"—and urges them to embrace all nature as God's, as the work of "... an [[immanence|immanent]] God, which is the God of Evolution, is infinitely grander than the occasional wonder-worker, who is the God of an old theology."<ref name="Religion p. 45">See Thomas Dixon "Science and Religion: A Very Short Introduction" p. 45</ref><ref>

In the 20th century [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] expressed the concept in similar terminology in letters he wrote while in a Nazi prison during [[World War II]], which were not made public until years later. <ref name="Dietrich Bonhoeffer 1953"/> Bonhoeffer wrote, for example: "...how wrong it is to use God as a stop-gap for the incompleteness of our knowledge. If in fact the frontiers of knowledge are being pushed further and further back (and that is bound to be the case), then God is being pushed back with them, and is therefore continually in retreat. We are to find God in what we know, not in what we don't know."<ref name="Dietrich Bonhoeffer 1953">Dietrich Bonhoeffer, letter to [[Eberhard Bethge]], 29 May 1944, pages 310–312, ''Letters and Papers from Prison'' edited by Eberhard Bethge, translated by Reginald H. Fuller, Touchstone, ISBN 0684838273, 1997; Translation of ''Widerstand und Ergebung'' Munich: Christian Kaiser Verlag, 1970</ref> . 

The term gained some attention when it was used in the 1955 book ''Science and Christian Belief'' by [[Charles Coulson|Charles Alfred Coulson]], where Coulson states: "There is no 'God of the gaps' to take over at those strategic places where science fails; and the reason is that gaps of this sort have the unpreventable habit of shrinking."<ref name="Charles Alfred Coulson 1955 p 20">Charles Alfred Coulson (1955) ''Science and Christian Belief'', p 20. </ref> . 

The term was used again in a 1971 book and a 1978 article, both by [[Richard Bube]].  He articulated the concept in greater detail in ''Man Come Of Age: Bonhoeffer’s Response To The God-Of-The-Gaps'' (1978). Bube attributed modern crises in religious faith in part to the inexorable shrinking of the God-of-the-gaps as scientific knowledge progressed. As humans progressively increased their understanding of nature, the previous "realm" of God seemed to many persons and religions to be getting smaller and smaller by comparison. Bube maintained that [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[Origin of Species]]'' was the "death knell" of the God-of-the-gaps. Bube also maintained that the God-of-the-gaps was not the same as the God of the Bible (that is, he was not making an [[argument]] against God per se, but rather asserting there was a fundamental problem with the perception of God as existing in the gaps of present-day knowledge). <ref name=Bube2>[http://www.etsjets.org/files/JETS-PDFs/14/14-4/14-4-pp203-220_JETS.pdf ''Man Come Of Age: Bonhoeffer’s Response To The God-Of-The-Gaps'']. [[Richard Bube]]. ''[[Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society]]''. Volume 14. 1971. pp.203–220. </ref> . 

==General usage==. 
The term "God of the gaps" is sometimes used in describing the perceived incremental retreat of religious explanations of physical [[phenomena]] in the face of increasingly comprehensive scientific explanations for those phenomena. <ref name="Charles Alfred Coulson 1955 p 20"/><ref name=Bube2/><ref name=Bube1>Richard Bube (1971) ''The Human Quest: A New Look at Science and the Christian Faith''</ref> . 

[[R. Laird Harris]] writes:
<blockquote>"The expression, "God of the Gaps," contains a real truth. It is erroneous if it is taken to mean that God is not immanent in natural law but is only to be observed in mysteries unexplained by law. No significant Christian group has believed this view. It is true, however, if it be taken to emphasize that God is not only immanent in natural law but also is active in the numerous phenomena associated with the supernatural and the spiritual. There are gaps in a physical-chemical explanation of this world, and there always will be. Because science has learned many marvelous secrets of nature, it cannot be concluded that it can explain all phenomena. Meaning, soul, spirits, and life are subjects incapable of physical-chemical explanation or formation."<ref>Harris, L. L, [http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1963/JASA12-63Harris.html "The God of the Gaps"].  ''[[JASA]]''. Vol.15.No.4. Dec. 1963. pp.&nbsp;101–104. </ref></blockquote> . 

==Usage in referring to a type of argument==<!-- This section is linked from [[Argument from ignorance]] -->
The term ''God-of-the-gaps argument'' can refer to a position that assumes an act of God as the explanation for an unknown phenomenon, which is a variant of an [[argument from ignorance]]. <ref>Michael Shermer  (2003) ''How We Believe: Science, Skepticism, and the Search for God'', p 115 ff. </ref><ref>Robert Larmer, "Is there anything wrong with 'God of the gaps' reasoning?" ''International Journal for Philosophy of Religion'', Volume 52, Number 3 / December, 2002, p 129 ff. </ref> Such an argument is sometimes reduced to the following form:
:*There is a gap in understanding of some aspect of the natural world. 
:*Therefore the cause must be supernatural. 
One example of such an argument, which uses God as an explanation of one of the current gaps in biological science, is as follows:
"Because current science can't figure out exactly how life started, it must be God who caused life to start." Critics of [[intelligent design creationism]], for example, have accused proponents of using this basic type of argument. <ref>See, e.g., Mark Isaak (2006) ''The Counter-Creationism Handbook'' pp x, 11–12, 35. </ref> . 

God-of-the-gaps arguments have been asserted by theologians to have the effect of relegating God to the leftovers of science: as scientific knowledge increases, the dominion of God decreases. <ref name="Dietrich Bonhoeffer 1953"/><ref name="Charles Alfred Coulson 1955 p 20"/><ref>Thomas Dixon "Science and Religion: A Very Short Introduction" p. 45</ref><ref>''Man Come Of Age: Bonhoeffer’s Response To The God-Of-The-Gaps'', [[Richard Bube]], 1971</ref> . 

==Criticism==. 
The God-of-the-gaps view has been criticized for implying that people perceive that God only acts in the gaps, and that God's activity is restricted to such "gaps". <ref>http://www.newdualism.org/papers/R.Larmer/Gaps.htm</ref> It has also been argued that the God-of-the-gaps view is predicated on the assumption that any event which can be explained by science automatically excludes God; that if God did not do something via direct action, God didn't do it at all. <ref>http://www.asa3.org/ASA/education/origins/gaps.htm</ref> "God of the gaps" argument has been traditionally advanced by scholarly Christians, intended as a criticism against weak or tenuous faith, not as a statement against theism or belief in God. <ref name="Religion p. 45"/><ref>Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Letters and Papers from Prison (1953, translated from the German by Reginald Fuller, 1962, ed. Eberhard Bethge)</ref><ref>Charles Alfred Coulson (1955) Science and Christian Belief, p 20. </ref>{{Syn|date=November 2009}} . 

According to [[John Habgood, Baron Habgood|John Habgood]] in ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology'', the phrase is generally derogatory, and is inherently a direct criticism of a tendency to postulate acts of God to explain phenomena for which science has yet to give a satisfactory account. <ref name="Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology">''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology'' (Ed. Alan Richardson, John Bowden, 1983), p 242 [http://books.google.com/books?id=PN7UMUTBBPAC&pg=PA242&dq=The+Westminster+Dictionary+of+Christian+Theology+god-of-the-gaps+phrase]</ref> Habgood also states:<blockquote>"It is theologically more satisfactory to look for evidence of God's actions within natural processes rather than apart from them, in much the same way that the meaning of a book transcends, but is not independent of, the paper and ink of which it is comprised."<ref name="Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology"/></blockquote> . 

God-of-the-gaps arguments have also been criticized for doubting that, in a world created by God, the mechanics of how things happen can always be described by science. <ref>http://www.dctech.com/physics/features/old/godofgap.php</ref> .
