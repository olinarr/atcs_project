'''Clinton Richard Dawkins''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], [[Royal Society of Literature|FRSL]] (born 26 March 1941), known as '''Richard Dawkins''', is a British [[ethology|ethologist]], [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] and author. He is an emeritus fellow of [[New College, Oxford]],<ref>[http://www.new.ox.ac.uk/content/about-fellows/emeritus-and-honorary-fellows Emeritus and Honorary Fellows] of [[New College, Oxford]]</ref> and was the [[University of Oxford]]'s [[Simonyi Professorship for the Public Understanding of Science|Professor for Public Understanding of Science]] from 1995 until 2008. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/previous-holders-simonyi-professorship|title=Previous holders of The Simonyi Professorship |accessdate=2010-09-23 |publisher=The University of Oxford}}</ref> . 

Dawkins came to prominence with his 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', which popularised the [[gene-centered view of evolution]] and introduced the term ''[[meme]]''. In 1982 he introduced an influential concept into [[evolutionary biology]], presented in his book ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]'', that the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism's body, but can stretch far into the environment, including the bodies of other organisms. <ref name="esf">{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090119081333.htm |title=European Evolutionary Biologists Rally Behind Richard Dawkins' Extended Phenotype |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=20 January 2009 |accessdate=2011-06-28}}</ref> . 

Dawkins is an [[atheist]], a vice president of the [[British Humanist Association]], and a supporter of the [[Brights movement]]. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/richard_dawkins_on_militant_atheism.html|title=Richard Dawkins on militant atheism|accessdate=2011-12-14 |publisher=TED Conferences, LLC}}</ref> He is well known for his criticism of [[creationism]] and [[intelligent design]]. In his 1986 book ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', he argued against the [[watchmaker analogy]], an argument for the existence of a [[God|supernatural creator]] based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he described evolutionary processes as analogous to a ''blind'' watchmaker. He has since written several popular science books, and makes regular television and radio appearances, predominantly discussing these topics. In his 2006 book ''[[The God Delusion]]'', Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion—a fixed false belief. <ref>{{cite book |title=The God Delusion |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |year=2006 |publisher=Transworld Publishers |isbn=0-5930-5548-9 |location= |page=5 }}</ref> As of January 2010 the English-language version has sold more than two million copies and had been translated into 31 languages. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://richarddawkins.net/articles/5000#455619 | publisher= Richard Dawkins at RichardDawkins.net | title= The God Delusion – back on the Times extended list at #24 |accessdate= 6 February 2010 | date = 27 January 2010 }}

{{Further2|[[Gene-centered view of evolution|Gene-centred view of evolution]]}}
In his scientific works, Dawkins is best known for his popularisation of the gene-centred view of evolution. This view is most clearly set out in his books ''The Selfish Gene'' (1976), where he notes that "all life evolves by the differential survival of replicating entities", and ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]'' (1982), in which he describes [[natural selection]] as "the process whereby [[DNA replication|replicators]] out-propagate each other". <ref>{{cite book |last=Lloyd |first=Elisabeth Anne |title=The structure and confirmation of evolutionary theory |url=http://books.google.com/?id=hO8vHTSiBkAC&pg=PA131&dq=%22the+process+whereby+replicators+out-propagate+each+other%22&cd=1#v=onepage&q=%22the%20process%20whereby%20replicators%20out-propagate%20each%20other%22 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9780691000466 |year=1994}}</ref> In his role as an [[ethologist]], interested in animal behaviour and its relation to natural selection, he advocates the idea that the [[gene]] is the principal [[unit of selection]] in [[evolution]].  . 

Dawkins has consistently been <!-- PLEASE NOTE: 'sceptical' is the correct British spelling, and Dawkins is British -->sceptical about non-adaptive processes in evolution (such as [[spandrel (biology)|spandrels]], described by [[Steven Jay Gould|Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin|Lewontin]])<ref name="gould-lewontin">{{cite journal|last=Gould|first=Stephen Jay|coauthors=Lewontin, Richard C.|year=1979|title=The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London|location=London|volume=B, VOL. 205|issue=1161|series=Series|pages=581–598|url=http://www.aaas.org/spp/dser/03_Areas/evolution/perspectives/Gould_Lewontin_1979.shtml|accessdate=2009-08-14}}</ref> and about selection at levels "above" that of the gene. <ref>Dawkins, Richard (1999).

This behaviour appears at first to be an evolutionary paradox, since helping others costs precious resources and decreases one's own [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]. Previously, many had interpreted this as an aspect of group selection: individuals were doing what was best for the survival of the population or species as a whole, and not specifically for themselves. British evolutionary biologist [[W. D. Hamilton]] had used the gene-centred view to explain altruism in terms of [[inclusive fitness]] and [[kin selection]] − that individuals behave altruistically toward their close relatives, who share many of their own genes. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Hamilton, W.D. |authorlink=W.

Critics of Dawkins' approach suggest that taking the [[gene]] as the unit of ''selection'' − of a single event in which an individual either succeeds or fails to reproduce − is misleading, but that the gene could be better described as a unit of ''evolution'' − of the long-term changes in [[allele]] frequencies in a population. <ref>{{cite book |title=Dear Mr Darwin |last=Dover |first=Gabriel |year=2000 |publisher=London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson |isbn=0-7538-1127-8 |pages= }}</ref> In ''The Selfish Gene'', Dawkins explains that he is using [[George C.

=== Meme ===. 
{{Main|Meme}}
Dawkins [[neologism|coined]] the word ''meme'' (the behavioural equivalent of a gene) as a way to encourage readers to think about how Darwinian principles might be extended beyond the realm of genes. <ref>{{cite book |author=Dawkins, Richard |title=[[The Selfish Gene]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=2nd |year=1989 |location=United Kingdom |page=11 |isbn=0-19-286092-5}}</ref> Indeed, it was intended as an extension of his "replicators" argument,  but it took on a life of its own in the hands of other authors such as [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Susan Blackmore]]. These popularisations then led to the emergence of the field of [[memetics]], from which he has distanced himself. <ref name="misunderstanding">Burman, J. T. (2012). The misunderstanding of memes: Biography of an unscientific object, 1976–1999. ''[[Perspectives on Science]], 20''(1), 75-104.

Dawkins' ''memes'' refer to any cultural entity that an observer might consider a replicator of a certain idea or a complex of ideas. He hypothesised that people could view many cultural entities as capable of such replication, generally through exposure to humans, who have evolved as efficient (although not perfect) copiers of information and behaviour. Memes are not always copied perfectly, and might indeed become refined, combined or otherwise modified with other ideas, resulting in new memes, which may themselves prove more, or less, efficient replicators than their predecessors, thus providing a framework for a hypothesis of [[cultural evolution]], analogous to the theory of biological evolution based on genes. <ref>{{cite book |author=Kelly, Kevin |title=[[Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World]] |publisher=Addison-Wesley |year=1994 |location=United States |page=360 |isbn=0-201-48340-8}}</ref>  . 

Although Dawkins invented the specific term ''meme'' independently, he has not claimed that the idea itself was entirely novel,<ref>

This book discussed the cultural transmission of experiences, with insights parallel to those of Dawkins. Laurent also found the term ''mneme'' used in [[Maurice Maeterlinck]]'s ''The Life of the White Ant'' (1926), and has highlighted the similarities to Dawkins' concept. <ref name=mneme/>

=== Criticism of creationism ===. 
Dawkins is a prominent critic of [[creationism]] (the religious belief that [[human]]ity, [[life]] and the [[universe]] were created by a [[deity]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/creationism/|title=Creationism|last=Ruse|first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Ruse|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Laboratory, [[Stanford University]]|quote=a Creationist is someone who believes in a god who is absolute creator of heaven and earth.|accessdate=2009-09-09}}</ref> without recourse to evolution<ref>{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Eugenie C|authorlink=Eugenie Scott|title=Evolution vs. creationism: an introduction|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA|page=51|chapter=Creationism|quote=The term 'creationism' to many people connotes the theological doctrine of special creationism: that God created the universe essentially as we see it today, and that this universe has not changed appreciably since that creation event. Special creationism includes the idea that God created living things in their present forms...|isbn=9780520261877}}</ref>). He has described the [[Young Earth creationism|Young Earth creationist]] view that the Earth is only a few thousand years old as "a preposterous, mind-shrinking falsehood",<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2002/mar/09/religion.schools1 |title=A scientist's view |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |date=9 March 2002 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=2009-11-07 |location=London}}</ref> and his 1986 book, ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', contains a sustained critique of the [[Teleological argument|argument from design]], an important creationist argument. In the book, Dawkins argued against the [[watchmaker analogy]] made famous by the 18th-century English [[theology|theologian]] [[William Paley]] in his book ''[[Natural Theology (Paley)|Natural Theology]]''. Paley argued that, just as a watch is too complicated and too functional to have sprung into existence merely by accident, so too must all living things, with their far greater complexity, be purposefully designed. Dawkins shares the view generally held by scientists that natural selection is sufficient to explain the apparent functionality and non-random complexity of the biological world, and can be said to play the role of watchmaker in nature, albeit as an automatic, nonintelligent, ''blind'' watchmaker. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Books/blind.shtml |title=Book: The Blind Watchmaker |accessdate=2008-02-28 |author=Catalano, John |publisher=The University of Oxford|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080415140851/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Books/blind.shtml |archivedate = 15 April 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> . 

[[File:Dawkins aaconf.jpg|thumb|left|Dawkins at the 34th annual conference of [[American Atheists]], 2008]]In 1986 Dawkins participated in an [[Oxford Union]] debate, in which he and English biologist [[John Maynard Smith]] debated [[Young Earth creationism|Young Earth creationist]] [[A. E. Wilder-Smith]] and Edgar Andrews, president of the [[Biblical Creation Society]].{{Ref label|b|b|none}} In general, however, Dawkins has followed the advice of his late colleague [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and refused to participate in formal debates with creationists because "what they seek is the oxygen of respectability", and doing so would "give them this oxygen by the mere act of ''engaging'' with them at all". He suggests that creationists "don't mind being beaten in an argument. What matters is that we give them recognition by bothering to argue with them in public."<ref>{{cite book |title=A Devil's Chaplain: Reflections on Hope, Lies, Science, and Love |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |year=2004 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |isbn=0-618-48539-2 |page=218 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=DwD4bjQozgYC}}, [http://books.google.be/books?id=DwD4bjQozgYC&pg=PA218 Chapter 5, p 218]</ref> . 

In a December 2004 interview with American journalist [[Bill Moyers]], Dawkins said that "among the things that science does know, evolution is about as certain as anything we know." When Moyers questioned him on the [[Evolution as theory and fact|use of the word ''theory'']], Dawkins stated that "evolution has been observed. It's just that it hasn't been observed while it's happening." He added that "it is rather like a detective coming on a murder after the scene... the detective hasn't actually seen the murder take place, of course. But what you do see is a massive clue... Huge quantities of circumstantial evidence. It might as well be spelled out in words of English."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/transcript349_full.html#dawkins |title=''Now'' with Bill Moyers |accessdate=2006-01-29 |author=Moyers, Bill |date=3 December 2004 |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service}}</ref> . 

Dawkins has ardently opposed the inclusion of [[intelligent design]] in science education, describing it as "not a scientific argument at all, but a religious one". <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2005/sep/01/schools.research |title=One side can be wrong |accessdate=2006-12-21 |date=1 September 2005 |author=Dawkins, Richard and Coyne, Jerry |publisher=The Guardian |location=London}}</ref> He has been referred to in the media as "Darwin's [[Rottweiler]]",<ref name=discover>{{cite web |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2005/sep/darwins-rottweiler |title=Darwin's Rottweiler |accessdate=2008-03-22 |author=Hall, Stephen S. |date=9 August 2005 |publisher=''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' magazine}}</ref> a reference to English biologist [[Thomas Henry Huxley|T.

Many of us saw religion as harmless nonsense. Beliefs might lack all supporting evidence but, we thought, if people needed a crutch for consolation, where's the harm? September 11th changed all that.

Dangerous because it gives them false courage to kill themselves, which automatically removes normal barriers to killing others.

In January 2006 Dawkins presented a two-part television documentary ''[[The Root of All Evil?]]'', addressing what he sees as the malignant influence of religion on society.

Dawkins' work has been controversial, and a number of Christian thinkers have responded to it.  For example, Oxford theologian Alister McGrath (author of ''[[The Dawkins Delusion]]'' and ''[[Dawkins' God: Genes, Memes, and the Meaning of Life|Dawkins' God]]'') maintains that Dawkins is ignorant of [[Christian theology]] and therefore unable to engage religion and faith intelligently. <ref>{{cite book |last= McGrath |first=Alister |authorlink=Alister McGrath |title=Dawkins' God: Genes, Memes, and the Meaning of Life |year=2004 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Oxford, England |isbn=1-405-12538-1 |page=81}}</ref> In reply, Dawkins asks "do you have to read up on leprechology before disbelieving in [[leprechaun]]s?",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://richarddawkins.net/articleComments,1647,Do-you-have-to-read-up-on-leprechology-before-disbelieving-in-them,Richard-Dawkins-The-Independent,page27 |title=Do you have to read up on leprechology before disbelieving in them? |accessdate=2007-11-14 |author=Dawkins, Richard |date=17 September 2007 |publisher=RichardDawkins.net }}</ref> and − in the paperback edition of ''The God Delusion'' − he refers to the [[United States|American]] biologist [[PZ Myers]], who has satirised this line of argument as "[[Courtier's reply|The Courtier's Reply]]". <ref name='Pharyngula 2006-12-24'>{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/12/the_courtiers_reply.php |title=The Courtier's Reply |accessdate=2007-11-14 |author=Myers, PZ |date=24 December 2006 | work=[[Pharyngula (blog)|Pharyngula]]}}</ref> Dawkins had an extended debate with McGrath at the 2007 ''[[Sunday Times]]'' Literary Festival. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/audio_video/podcasts/books/article1570989.ece |title=Richard Dawkins at The Sunday Times Oxford Literary Festival |accessdate=2008-03-04 |author=Cole, Judith |date=26 March 2007 |work=The Times |location=London}} {{dead link|date=June 2010| bot=DASHBot}}</ref> . 

Dawkins argues that "the existence of God is a scientific hypothesis like any other". <ref>{{cite book |title=The God Delusion |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |year=2006 |isbn=0-618-68000-4 |page=50 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co. |location=Boston}}</ref> He disagrees with [[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s principle of [[Non-overlapping magisteria|nonoverlapping magisteria]]. In an interview with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, Dawkins said:
<blockquote>
I think that Gould's separate compartments was a purely political ploy to win middle-of-the-road religious people to the science camp. But it's a very empty idea. There are plenty of places where religion does not keep off the scientific turf. Any belief in miracles is flat contradictory not just to the facts of science but to the spirit of science. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1555132-3,00.html |title=God vs. Science (3) |accessdate=2008-04-03 |date=5 November 2006 |author=Van Biema, David |publisher=[[Time (Magazine)|Time]]}}</ref></blockquote> . 

Astrophysicist [[Martin Rees, Baron Rees of Ludlow|Martin Rees]], who has described himself as an unbeliever who identifies with Christianity from a cultural perspective, has suggested that Dawkins' attack on mainstream religion is unhelpful. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/hay2007/story/0,,2089947,00.html |title=Scientists divided over alliance with religion |accessdate=2008-03-17 |author=Jha, Alok |date=29 May 2007 |publisher=The Guardian |location=London}}</ref> Regarding Rees' claim in his book ''Our Cosmic Habitat'' that "such questions lie beyond science", Dawkins asks "what expertise can theologians bring to deep cosmological questions that scientists cannot?"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/dawkins_18_2.html |title=When Religion Steps on Science's Turf |accessdate=2008-04-03 |author=Dawkins, Richard |year=2006 |publisher=Free Inquiry magazine}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The God Delusion |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |year=2006 |isbn=0-618-68000-4 |pages=55–56 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co. |location=Boston}}</ref> Elsewhere, Dawkins has written that "there's all the difference in the world between a belief that one is prepared to defend by quoting evidence and logic, and a belief that is supported by nothing more than tradition, authority or revelation."<ref name="Is Science a Religion?"/>

In October 2008, Dawkins officially supported the UK's first atheist advertising initiative, the [[Atheist Bus Campaign]]. Created by Guardian journalist [[Ariane Sherine]] and administered by the [[British Humanist Association]] the campaign aimed to raise funds to place atheist adverts on buses in the London area, and Dawkins pledged to match the amount raised by atheists, up to a maximum of £5,500. However, the campaign was an unprecedented success, raising over £100,000 in its first four days, and generating global press coverage. <ref>{{cite news | publisher = The Guardian | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/oct/21/religion-advertising | author = Ariane Sherine | title = All aboard the atheist bus campaign |accessdate =2008-12-11 |location=London |date=22 October 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | publisher = The Guardian | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/oct/23/atheist-bus-campaign-ariane-sherine | author = Ariane Sherine | title = 'Probably' the best atheist bus campaign ever |accessdate =2008-12-11 |location=London |date=23 October 2008}}</ref> The campaign, started in January 2009, features adverts across the UK with the slogan: "''There's probably no God.

In his role as professor for public understanding of science, Dawkins has been a critic of [[pseudoscience]] and [[alternative medicine]]. His 1998 book ''[[Unweaving the Rainbow]]'' takes [[John Keats]]' accusation that, by explaining the [[rainbow]], [[Isaac Newton]] had diminished its beauty, and argues for the opposite conclusion. He suggests that deep space, the billions of years of life's evolution, and the microscopic workings of biology and heredity contain more beauty and wonder than do "myths" and "pseudoscience". <ref>{{cite book |title=Unweaving The Rainbow |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |year=1998 |publisher=Penguin |location=United Kingdom |isbn=0-618-05673-4 |pages=4–7}}</ref> Dawkins wrote a foreword to [[John Diamond (journalist)|John Diamond]]'s posthumously published ''Snake Oil'', a book devoted to debunking alternative medicine, in which he asserted that alternative medicine was harmful, if only because it distracted patients from more successful conventional treatments and gave people false hopes. <ref>{{cite book |title=Snake Oil and Other Preoccupations |last=Diamond |first=John |year=2001 |publisher=Vintage |location=United Kingdom |isbn=0-099-42833-4}}</ref> Dawkins states that "there is no alternative medicine.

He specifically cites [[astrology]], [[spiritualism]], [[dowsing]], alternative faiths, [[alternative medicine]] and [[homoeopathy]]. He also discusses how the [[Internet]] can be used to spread religious hatred and conspiracy theories with scant attention to evidence-based reasoning.  . 

Continuing a long-standing partnership with [[Channel 4]], Dawkins participated in a five-part television series ''[[Genius of Britain]]'', along with fellow scientists [[Stephen Hawking]], [[James Dyson]], [[Paul Nurse]], and [[Jim Al-Khalili]].

In 1998 Dawkins expressed his appreciation for two books, famous for their criticism of [[postmodernism]] in US universities, in departments like literary studies, anthropology and other cultural studies; the two books are ''[[Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels with Science]]'' (by [[Paul R. Gross|Gross]] and [[Norman Levitt|Levitt]]) and ''[[Intellectual Impostures]]'' (by [[Alan Sokal|Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont|Bricmont]]), both related to the [[Sokal affair]] hoax. <ref name="postmodernism">{{cite web|url=http://physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/dawkins.html|author=Dawkins, Richard|title=Postmodernism Disrobed|accessdate=2010-09-24}}</ref> In the same occasion Dawkins also criticised [[Cambridge University]] for awarding philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] an [[Jacques Derrida#Cambridge Honorary Doctorate|honorary doctorate]]. <ref name="postmodernism"/> .
