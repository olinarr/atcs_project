'''Criticism of religion''' is [[criticism]] of the concepts, validity, and/or practices of [[religion]], including associated political and social implications. <ref>{{Cite book| last=Beckford|first=James A.|title=Social Theory and Religion| year=2003| publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-77431-4}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} . 

Religious criticism has a long history, going back at least as far as the 5th century BCE in [[ancient Greece]] with [[Diagoras of Melos|Diagoras "the atheist" of Melos]], and 1st century BCE in [[ancient Rome|Rome]] with [[Titus Lucretius Carus]]'s ''[[De Rerum Natura]]'', and continuing to the present day with the advent of [[New Atheism]], represented by such authors and journalists as [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Victor J. Stenger]], and [[Christopher Hitchens]].  Alternatively, "religious criticism" has been used by the literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] to describe a mode of religious discussion that is secular or separate from religion but not inherently anti-religion.  . 

Critics consider religion to be outdated, harmful to the individual (such as  [[brainwashing]] of children, [[faith healing]], [[circumcision]]), harmful to society (such as [[religious war|holy war]]s, [[terrorism]], wasteful distribution of resources), to impede the progress of [[science]], and to encourage immoral acts (such as blood sacrifice, [[homophobia|discrimination against homosexuals]] [[misogyny|and women]]).  . 

==History==. 
The 1st century BCE Roman poet, [[Titus Lucretius Carus]], in his magnum opus ''[[De Rerum Natura]]'', wrote: "But 'tis that same religion oftener far / Hath bred the foul impieties of men:"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.mirror.org/gb.lucretius.html |author=Titus Lucretius Carus| authorlink=Titus Lucretius Carus |title=De Rerum Natura |accessdate=2007-08-05 |work=}}</ref> A philosopher of the [[Epicurean]] school, Lucretius believed the world was composed solely of matter and void, and that all phenomena could be understood as resulting from purely natural causes. Lucretius, like [[Epicurus]], felt that religion was born of fear and ignorance, and that understanding the natural world would free people of its shackles. <ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/l/lucretiu.htm |title=Lucretius (c.99&nbsp;– c.55 BCE) |publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=2007-08-05 |work=}}</ref> . 

[[Niccolò Machiavelli]], at the beginning of the 16th century said: "We Italians are irreligious and corrupt above others... because the church and her representatives have set us the worst example."<ref name="isbn014044534x">{{Cite book|author= Middlemore, S.

Writing in 1776 of the ancient Romans, [[Edward Gibbon]] said: "The various modes of worship which prevailed in the Roman world were all considered by the people as equally true; by the philosopher as equally false; and by the magistrate as equally useful."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1365&chapter=50990&layout=html |title=Online Library of Liberty – The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, vol. 1, chp ii |accessdate=2007-08-25 |work=}}</ref> . 

[[Deism]] became prominent in the 17th and 18th centuries during the [[Age of Enlightenment]], especially in the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and the [[United States]], mostly among those raised as Christians who found they could not believe in either the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], the [[divinity of Jesus]], [[miracles]], or the [[biblical inerrancy|inerrancy of scriptures]], but who did believe in [[monotheism|one god]]. Initially it did not form any congregations, but in time deism strongly influenced other religious groups, such as [[Unitarianism]] and [[Universalism]], which developed from it. It continues to this day in the form of classical deism and modern deism.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} . 

Interest in and controversy over criticism of religion has increased in the 21st century due to the spread of so-called [[New Atheism]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} .

A major criticism of many religions is that they require beliefs that are irrational, unscientific, or unreasonable. Stated differently, religious beliefs and traditions lack scientific or rational foundations. There are several aspects to this criticism, including: . 

* Religions often posit facts that are contradicted by scientific evidence (e.g. [[evolution]], [[cosmology|origin of the universe]], [[miracles]]); for example, the claim that prayer has a beneficial effect on others has been tested and disproved. <ref name="sevenseven"/>
* Religions often require behaviors that are not sensible (such as the [[Old Testament]] prohibition against wearing garments of mixed fabrics, or punishing children of guilty parents). <ref>{{Cite book |title=God is Not Great |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens  | publisher=Random House, Inc. |year= 2007 |page=99 |isbn=0-7710-4142-X }}</ref>
* Religions and their holy books contain rules and laws designed to govern behavior and conduct, some of which—within a single religion—are contradictory or impossible to follow.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}
* Religions and their holy books often contain conflicting facts or histories (for example, [[Internal consistency of the Bible|discrepancies in the Bible]] among the four [[Gospels]] of the [[New Testament]]). <ref>Bart Ehrman; [[Misquoting Jesus]], 166</ref><ref>Bruce M. Metzger, ''The Text of the New Testament: its transmission, corruption, and restoration'', pp. 199-200</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Brown | first=Raymond Edward | authorlink=Raymond E.

* Religions have claimed the truth of stories which contain elements indistinguishable from [[fairy tales]] or [[superstitions]] (such as [[astrology]] or [[Santa Claus]]).{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}
* Religions cannot adapt to a changing world, and their teachings are outdated in comparison with modern Western morals. For instance, the rules on certain diets—such as the [[Torah]]'s prohibition of eating pork or shellfish—may have made sense some thousands of years ago, when certain animals were often infested with parasites. However, such a prohibition in modern times may be illogical, as the quality and safety of food have improved.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} . 

Religions have promoted facts and histories that are contradicted by science. These often form the basis of significant controversies, such as the trial of [[Galileo]] for his purported heresy that the earth moves around the sun. The origin of the earth or universe is often described by holy books in the form of [[creation myth]]s, which are contradicted by scientific theories of [[cosmology]]. The origin of the human species, as presented by many Christian sects, is contradicted by the [[scientific theory]] of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]]. In other cases, religions assert the factual existence of phenomena such as [[miracles]] and [[angels]], which are not necessarily [[negative proof|contradicted by science]], but find little or no scientific support.  . 

Religious adherents, such as the notable Christian apologist [[C. S. Lewis]], counter these arguments by suggesting that all religions, by definition, involve faith, or a belief in concepts that cannot be proven or disproven by science. However, some religious beliefs have been disproven by science, for instance [[Young Earth creationism]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interacademies.net/Object.File/Master/6/150/Evolution%20statement.pdf|title=IAP Statement on the teaching of evolution|year=2006|publisher=the Interacademy Panel on international issues|accessdate = 2007-07-03|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070701142913/http://www.interacademies.net/Object.File/Master/6/150/Evolution+statement.pdf |archivedate = 2007-07-01}}</ref> Scientist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] agreed with C. S. Lewis and suggested that religion and science were [[non-overlapping magisteria]]. <ref>{{Cite book|author=Gould, Stephen Jay |title=[[Rocks of Ages|Rocks of Ages: Science and Religion in the Fullness of Life]] |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York |year= 2002|pages= |isbn=0-345-45040-X}}</ref> Scientist Richard Dawkins has said that religious practitioners often do not believe in the view of [[non-overlapping magisteria]] (NOMA). <ref name="sevenseven">{{Cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Dawkins|title=The God Delusion|edition=Paperback|year=2007|page=77}}</ref> Dawkins argues that any time a religious person claims that a certain event (e.g. the [[Love Parade stampede]])<ref>[http://www.prwatch.org/node/8909s.com/articles/TopStories/2010/08/08/Stampede_deaths_were_Gods_punishment_496048.html prwatch.org]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref> is a punishment by God or that they have been helped or rewarded by God for their actions ("thank god") the NOMA thesis is violated. For NOMA to hold, Dawkins argues the supernatural being in question must not have any effect on people's physical lives, and that only claims regarding the afterlife are allowed.  . 

===Conflicting claims of "one true faith"===. 
{{See also|Argument from inconsistent revelations}}
Some critics of religion discuss the multiplicity of religions that claim to be the one true faith, such as [[Roman Catholicism]], [[Mormonism]], or [[Evangelical Christianity]].  Critics point out that if two or more religions claim to be the only valid faith, then logic dictates that the claims of all but one of those religions must be wrong.  Atheist Stephen Roberts illustrates this principle as follows:
{{cquote2|I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours.|Stephen F. Roberts,<ref>{{Cite book| title=Like Rolling Uphill: realizing the honesty of atheism | first=Dianna | last=Narciso | isbn=1-932560-74-2 | page=6 | year=2003 | publisher=Llumina Press | location=Coral Springs, FL}}</ref> quoted in ''Like Rolling Uphill''}} . 

Survey research from the US indicates that many people change their religious affiliation over time. Those with no religious affiliation are the fastest growing group. However, this group has a relatively low retention rate (46%) when compared to other groups. Such data suggest that significant numbers of people do not believe consistently that a single faith is uniquely true. <ref>[http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report-religious-landscape-study-chapter-2.pdf "Changes in Americans’ Religious Affiliation,"] ''U.S. Religious Landscape Survey: Chapter 2'', Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life, [[Pew Research Center]], February 2008</ref> . 

===Lack of permanence===. 
Critics such as Opsopaus and Hitchens cite what they describe as obsolete religions—religions that no longer have active adherents—as evidence that religions are not everlasting, as the religions claim. <ref>{{Cite book| last =Opsopaus | first =John | authorlink =  | title =The Art of Haruspicy | work = | publisher = | date = | url =http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/Har.html | doi = | accessdate = }}</ref> Some obsolete religions discussed by critics include [[Greek mythology]], [[Millerism]], [[Roman mythology]], [[Sabbatai Sevi]], and [[Norse mythology]]. <ref>{{Cite book|title=God is Not Great| first= Christopher| last=Hitchens | pages=169–173}}</ref> The short work "The Syrian Goddess" by the ancient author [[Lucian of Samosata]] provides many examples of once thriving religions that had gone out of existence. <ref>{{Cite book | first1 =Herbert A. | authorlink = | first2 =John | last2=Garstang | title =The Syrian Goddess | publisher = | year =1913 | location = | pages = | url =http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/tsg/index.htm | doi = | id = | last =1=Strong | unused_data =last 1=Strong }}</ref> . 

==Explanations as non-divine in origin==. 
===Social construct===. 
{{See also|Development of religion}} . 

Some critics of religion, including Dennett, Harris, and Hitchens, assert that theist religions and their [[holy book]]s are not divinely inspired, but instead are fabrications of non-[[divinity|divine]] human individuals, created to fulfill [[society|social]], [[biological]], and [[political]] needs. <ref>{{Cite book|title=[[Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon|Breaking the Spell]]|publisher=Allen Lane|year=2006|isbn=0-7139-9789-3|first=Daniel|last=Dennett|authorlink=Daniel Dennett}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=[[The End of Faith]]|publisher=W.

Under this view, the origins of religion lie in human beings and human [[society|societies]], not in the intervention of some divine being or cosmic truth. Accordingly, the historicity of religious accounts is called into question.  . 

===Narratives to provide comfort and meaning===. 
[[File:Christopher Hitchens crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Christopher Hitchens]], journalist and author of ''[[God is not Great]]'']]
With the exception of more modern religions, such as [[Raëlism]], [[Mormonism]], [[Scientology]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith]], most religions were formulated at a time when the origin of life, the workings of the body, and the nature of the stars and planets were poorly understood. <ref>{{Cite book|author=Dennett, Daniel Clement |title=Breaking the Spell : Religion as a Natural Phenomenon |publisher=Viking Adult |location= |year= 2006|pages= |isbn=0-670-03472-X |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>  Religious systems attempted to address significant personal emotional issues, and tried to explain a frightening existence, usually through a dramatic narrative outlining how the world and their community came to be.  . 

These narratives were intended to give solace and a sense of relationship with larger forces. As such, they may have served several important functions in ancient societies.  Examples include the views many religions traditionally had towards solar and lunar [[eclipse]]s, and the appearance of [[comet]]s (forms of  [[astrology]]). <ref>{{Cite news| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =When solar fears eclipse reason | work = | publisher =BBC News | date =2006-03-28 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4852690.stm | doi = | accessdate=2010-01-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Comets in Ancient Cultures | work = | publisher =NASA | date = | url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/deepimpact/media/f_ancient.html | doi = | accessdate =  }}</ref>
Given current understanding in such fields as [[biology]], [[psychology]], [[chemistry]], and [[physics]], where human knowledge has increased dramatically, many critics&nbsp;— including [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Christopher Hitchens]], and [[Michel Onfray]]&nbsp;— contend that continuing to hold on to these idea systems is [[wikt:absurd|absurd]] and [[irrational]]. <ref name=godisnotgreat>{{Cite book| last=Hitchens | first=Christopher | authorlink=Christopher Hitchens | coauthors= | title=[[God is not Great|God is not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything]] | publisher= Twelve| year=2007 | location= New York| pages= | url= | doi= | isbn= 978-0-446-57980-3 }}</ref><ref name="The God Delusion" /><ref name="isbn1-55970-820-4">{{Cite book|author=Onfray, Michel |authorlink=Michel Onfray |title=Atheist Manifesto: The Case Against Christianity, Judaism, and Islam |publisher=Arcade Publishing |location= |year= 2007|pages= |isbn=1-55970-820-4 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> .

====Opium of the people====. 
[[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Karl Marx]]]]
{{cquote2|Religious suffering is, at the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the [[opium of the people]].|[[Karl Marx]]<ref name="critright"/>}} . 

According to [[Karl Marx]], religion is a tool utilized by the [[ruling class]]es whereby the masses can shortly relieve their suffering via the act of experiencing religious emotions. It is in the interest of the ruling classes to instill in the masses the religious conviction that their current suffering will lead to eventual happiness. Therefore as long as the public believes in religion, they will not attempt to make any genuine effort to understand and overcome the real source of their suffering, which in Marx's opinion was their [[capitalist]] economic system. <ref name="critright">{{Cite book| last =Marx | first =Karl | authorlink =Karl Marx |chapter=Introduction | title = A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right | publisher =Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher | month =February | year =1844 | location = | pages = | url =http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/intro.htm }}</ref> . 

In this perspective, Marx saw religion as [[escapism]]:<ref name="critright"/>
<blockquote>The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo. </blockquote> . 

Marx also viewed the Christian doctrine of [[original sin]] as being deeply [[anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] in character. Original sin, he argued, convinces people that the source of their misery lies in the inherent and unchangeable "sinfulness" of humanity rather than in the forms of social organization and institutions, which, Marx argued, can be changed through the application of collective social planning. <ref>{{Cite book| last =Marx | first =Karl | authorlink =Karl Marx | coauthors = | title =Das Kapital | publisher = | year =1867 | location =  | url =http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch26.htm | doi = | id = | nopp =true| page =Volume 1, Part VIII  }}</ref> . 

===Viruses of the mind===. 
[[File:Richard dawkins lecture.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Richard Dawkins]], author of ''[[The God Delusion]]'' ]]
In his 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] coined the term [[memes]] to describe informational units that can be transmitted culturally, analogous to genes. <ref>{{Cite book| last =Dawkins | first =Richard | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =[[The Selfish Gene]], 30th Anniversary edition  | publisher =  | year =2006 | location = | pages = | url =  | doi =  | id =  }}</ref> He later used this concept in the essay "[[Viruses of the Mind]]" to explain the persistence of religious ideas in human culture. <ref>{{cite web| last =Dawkins | first =Richard | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Viruses of the Mind | work = | publisher = | year =1991 | url =http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/Dawkins/viruses-of-the-mind.html | doi = | accessdate =  }}</ref> . 

Dawkins argues that religious ideologies are a set of ideas and concepts working together to ensure the perpetuation and proliferation of the religion itself. For instance, important concepts in [[Christianity]] are raising one's children to be Christians, following The [[Great Commission]] and its [[monotheist]]ic nature. These are proposed to work together to protect the religion from competition from other memes. In this context, religion is criticized for being [[Maladaptation|maladaptive]] in that it can cause the carrier of that meme to act irrationally, misallocate resources and feel guilt, fear or other negative emotions without real reason.  . 

Religion apologist [[John Bowker]] criticized the idea that "God" and "Faith" are viruses of the mind, suggesting that Dawkins' "account of religious motivation ... is ... far removed from evidence and data" and that, even if the God-meme approach were valid, "it does not give rise to one set of consequences ... Out of the many behaviours it produces, why are we required to isolate only those that might be regarded as diseased?"<ref>In his 1992–93 [[Gresham College]] lectures, written in collaboration with the psychiatrist Quinton Deeley and published as ''Is God a Virus?'', SPCK, 1995, 274 pp. The quotes here come from p.73. </ref>  [[Alister McGrath]] has responded by arguing that "memes have no place in serious scientific reflection",<ref>''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'', p.125, quoting [[Simon Conway Morris]] in support</ref> that there is strong evidence that such ideas are not spread by random processes, but by deliberate intentional actions,<ref>''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'', p.126</ref> that "evolution" of ideas is more [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] than Darwinian,<ref>''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'', p.127</ref> and that there is no evidence (and certainly none in the essay) that epidemiological models usefully explain the spread of religious ideas. <ref>''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'' pp.137–138</ref> McGrath also cites a metareview of 100 studies and argues that "[i]f religion is reported as having a positive effect on human well-being by 79% of recent studies in the field, how can it conceivably be regarded as analogous to a virus?"<ref>''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'', p.136, citing [[Harold G.

===Mental illness or delusion===. 
[[File:Bodies at Jonestown.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Bodies recovered from the [[Jonestown]] massacre, in which members of a religious cult committed a mass murder/suicide]]
Critics such as [[Richard Dawkins]] argue that religious belief often involves [[delusion]]al behavior. <ref name="The God Delusion" /> American author [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], author of ''[[The End of Faith]]'' and ''[[Letter to a Christian Nation]]'' compares religion to mental illness, saying it "allows otherwise normal human beings to reap the fruits of madness and consider them ''holy''."<!--Italicized in original--><ref name=endoffaith>{{Cite book| last=Harris | first=Sam | authorlink =Sam Harris (author) | title=The End of Faith | publisher=W.W.

Religion apologist [[Keith Ward]] in his book ''[[Is Religion Dangerous?]]'' addresses the claim that religious belief is a [[delusion]]. He quotes the definition in the ''Oxford Companion to Mind'' as "a fixed, idiosyncratic belief, unusual in the culture to which the person belongs," and notes that "[n]ot all false opinions are delusions."  Ward then characterizes a delusion as a "clearly false opinion, especially as a symptom of a mental illness," an "irrational belief" that is "so obviously false that all reasonable people would see it as mistaken." He then says that belief in God is different, since "[m]ost great philosophers have believed in God, and they are rational people".  He argues that "[a]ll that is needed to refute the claim that religious belief is a delusion is one clear example of someone who exhibits a high degree of rational ability, who functions well in the ordinary affairs of life ... and who can produce a reasonable and coherent defense of their beliefs" and claims that there are many such people, "including some of the most able philosophers and scientists in the world today."<ref>{{Cite book| last =Ward | first =Keith | authorlink =Keith Ward | title =Is Religion Dangerous? | publisher = Lion| year =2006 | location =London:Lion Hudson Plc | url = | doi = | isbn = 978-0-7459-5262-8 | page =172 }}</ref> . 

===Evolved characteristic of the human brain===. 
{{See also|Evolutionary psychology of religion|Evolutionary origin of religions}}
Some critics, such as [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Pascal Boyer]], contend that religion is nothing more than a social construct that [[Evolutionary psychology of religion|primitive humans evolved]] to improve their odds of survival.  Dawkins and others have posited that a pre-disposition to believe in superstitions and religion could enhance the survival of the human species, by enhancing fear of imagined (and sometimes real) dangers, and thus increasing the likelihood that humans would take pre-emptive defensive measures.  . 

Research in 2009 on the so-called "God Spot" has found that several areas of the brain are involved in religious belief, one within the frontal lobes of the cortex—which are distinctively developed in humans—and another in the more evolutionary-ancient regions deeper inside the brain, which humans share with apes and other primates. The study found that people of different religious persuasions and beliefs, as well as atheists, all tended to use the same circuits in the brain to solve a perceived moral conundrum which were also the same ones used when religiously-inclined people dealt with issues related to God. The findings support the idea that the brain has evolved to be sensitive to any form of belief that improves the chances of survival and suggests the brain is inherently sensitive to believing in almost anything if there are grounds for doing so. This work was followed by a study where scientists tried to stimulate the temporal lobes with a rotating magnetic field. [[Michael Persinger]], from [[Laurentian University]] in [[Ontario]], found that he could artificially create the experience of religious feelings in 80% of volunteers. <ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/belief-and-the-brains--god-spot-1641022.html "Belief and the brain's 'God spot'"], ''[[The Independent]]', 10 March 2009. </ref> .

Some critics of religion say that religion is merely an early phase during the development of a culture or society, and that religion is often replaced with more rational or reasonable belief systems.  Many critics assert that the needs of religion can be met with alternative, superior means, namely: the need for explaining life and death can be met by science and [[philosophy]]; questions of [[Goodness and evil|good and evil]] are addressed by [[ethics]]; and inspiration and beauty can be found in [[the arts]]. <ref>{{cite web| last =Stewart | first =Robert Charles   | authorlink = | title =Academy of Evolutionary Metaphysics, Replacing Religion with Science | work = | publisher =Academy of Evolutionary Metaphysics | date = | url =http://www.evolutionary-metaphysics.net/replacing_religion.html | doi =  | accessdate =  }}</ref> .

[[Daniel Dennett]], author of ''[[Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon|Breaking the Spell]]'', said "I expect to live to see the evaporation of the powerful mystique of religion.

Philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] posited that many societal constructs pass through [[Law of three stages|three stages]], and that religion corresponds to the two earlier, or more primitive stages. 
{{cquote2|From the study of the development of human intelligence, in all directions, and through all times, the discovery arises of a great fundamental law, to which it is necessarily subject, and which has a solid foundation of proof, both in the facts of our organization and in our historical experience. The law is this: that each of our leading conceptions – each branch of our knowledge – passes successively through three different theoretical conditions: the theological, or fictitious; the metaphysical, or abstract; and the scientific, or positive.|Auguste Comte}} . 

==Harm to individuals==. 
Many aspects of religion are criticized by skeptics on the basis that they are harmful to the individual believer. <ref name="pediatrics" /> They cite the effects of what they consider dogmatic adherence to irrational beliefs and practices such as withholding medical care<ref name="cures" /> and self-sacrifice,<ref name="self-sacrifice">Branden, N. (1963), "Mental Health versus Mysticism and Self-Sacrifice," Ayn Rand – The Virtue of Selfishness: A New Concept of Egoism. </ref> as well as unnatural restrictions on human behaviour (such as [[teetotalism]] and [[Religion and sexuality|sexual prohibitions]]) and claim that these result in mental and emotional trauma of fear and guilt. <ref name="Hitchins" /> . 

===Indoctrination of children===. 
{{See also|Indoctrination|Mind control|Religion and children}}
Philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] spoke of the subject in 19th century:
{{quote|"And as the capacity for believing is strongest in childhood, special care is taken to make sure of this tender age. This has much more to do with the doctrines of belief taking root than threats and reports of miracles. If, in early childhood, certain fundamental views and doctrines are paraded with unusual solemnity, and an air of the greatest earnestness never before visible in anything else; if, at the same time, the possibility of a doubt about them be completely passed over, or touched upon only to indicate that doubt is the first step to eternal perdition, the resulting impression will be so deep that, as a rule, that is, in almost every case, doubt about them will be almost as impossible as doubt about one's own existence."|Arthur Schopenhauer|''On Religion: A Dialogue''}} . 

Critics such as [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] use the term [[child abuse]] to describe the harm that some religious upbringings inflict on children. <ref name="Richard Dawkins">{{Cite book| author=Richard Dawkins | title=The God Delusion | chapter=Childhood, abuse and the escape from religion}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| first=Christopher |last=Hitchens| title=God is Not Great| chapter=Is Religion Child Abuse?}}</ref> They claim that children are especially vulnerable to mental harms related to religion, including:{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} . 

* Terrorized by threats of punishment, such as eternal damnation in a fiery hell
* Extreme guilt about normal, healthy sexual functions
* Trained to disrespect science and reason
* Indoctrinated into a particular religious faith, thus depriving the child of the opportunity to make their own free inquiry later, when they are mature . 

Dawkins states that he is angered by the labels "Muslim child" or "Catholic child". He asks how a young child can be considered intellectually mature enough to have such independent views on the cosmos and humanity’s place within it. By contrast, Dawkins points out, no reasonable person would speak of a "[[Marxism|Marxist]] child" or a "[[Tory]] child". <ref name="Richard Dawkins"/> He suggests there is little controversy over such labeling because of the "weirdly privileged status of religion".  . 

On several occasions Dawkins has also made the controversial claim that sexually abusing a child is "arguably less" damaging than "the long term psychological damage inflicted by bringing up a child Catholic in the first place". <ref name="Richard Dawkins" /> This claim was later rebutted by [[Theodore Beale]] who wrote that Dawkins "first provides anecdotal information from one woman who was raised Catholic, was sexually abused by a priest, and later had nightmares about Hell....Despite posing the proposition as a comparison, Dawkins does not bother to consider what, if any, the negative effects of childhood sexual trauma might happen to be" and notes that "half" of the anecdotes Dawkins cites in favour of his case "aren't even related to Catholicism". <ref>{{cite book|last=Day|first=Vox|title=The Irrational Atheist|year=2008|publisher=Benbella Books, inc|pages=146-149}}</ref> Beale cites several studies that attribute suicide to childhood sexual abuse rather than to religion. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Dr Jonathan R.T.|first=Davidson|coauthors=D.C.

===Jerusalem syndrome===. 
{{Main|Jerusalem syndrome}}
There are certain places with deep associations with religious feeling, often called places of [[pilgrimage]]. One of these is Jerusalem, which is revered by followers of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Jerusalem has lent its name to a unique psychological phenomenon where Jewish or Christian individuals who develop obsessive religious themed ideas or delusions (sometimes believing themselves to be Jesus Christ or another prophet) will feel compelled to travel to Jerusalem. <ref>{{cite web|title=Jerusalem Syndrome: Jewish Virtual Library|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/jersynd.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Jerusalem Syndrome|url=http://savvytraveler.publicradio.org/show/features/2000/20000603/jerusalem.shtml}}</ref> .

Some aspects of religion are criticized on the basis that they damage society as a whole.

Most religions hold their teachings or revelations to be those that are the closest to the universal truths and those of other religions to be further from, or more often, in direct contradiction with these truths. Critics of this worldview{{Who|date=November 2009}} claim that this monopoly of universal truths leads, inevitably, to a very ingrained "us vs. them" group [[wikt:solidarity|solidarity]] and mentality (often referred to as [[moral superiority]]) which, to a wide range of extents, dehumanise or [[Demonization|demonise]] individuals outside the particular faith as "not fully human", or in some way less worthy and less deserving of rights and regard. Results can, based on the fanaticism of this belief, vary from mild [[discrimination]] to outright [[genocide]]. <ref>{{Cite journal| last =Hartung | first =John | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Love Thy Neighbour, The Evolution of In-Group Morality | journal =Skeptic | volume =3 | issue =5 | pages = | year =1995 | url =http://www.lrainc.com/swtaboo/taboos/ltn01.html  | doi =  | id = | accessdate =  }}</ref> .

Data for this study was obtained from approximately 23,000 people in almost all (17) of the developed democracies.  While the data was multi-national, further evidence of religion's effect on societal health was concluded from regional differences in the [[United States]]. According to paleontologist [[Gregory S. Paul]]: . 

<blockquote>There is evidence that within the U.S. strong disparities in religious belief versus acceptance of evolution are correlated with similarly varying rates of societal dysfunction, the strongly theistic, anti-evolution [[Southern United States|south]] and [[Midwestern United States|mid-west]] having markedly worse homicide, mortality, STD, youth pregnancy, marital and related problems than [[Northeastern United States|the northeast]] where societal conditions, secularization, and acceptance of evolution approach European norms. </blockquote>
An analysis published later in the same journal contends that a number of methodological problems undermine any findings or conclusions to be taken from Paul's research. <ref name="moses.creighton.edu"/> .

===Suppression of scientific progress===. 
[[File:Galileo facing the Roman Inquisition.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Galileo]] facing the [[Roman Inquisition]]]]
[[John William Draper]] and [[Andrew Dickson White]], authors of the [[conflict thesis]], have argued that when a religion offers a complete set of answers to the problems of purpose, [[morality]], origins, or science, it often discourages exploration of those areas by suppressing curiosity, denies its followers a broader perspective, and can prevent social, moral and scientific progress. Examples of scientific suppression by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] include the [[Galileo affair|trial of Galileo]] for arguing that the Earth revolves around the Sun, and the execution of scientist and philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]].  . 

In more recent time, many debates have arisen that follow a pattern of [[faith and rationality|faith versus reason]], in particular the rise of [[fundamentalist]] and [[biblical literalism|bible literalist]] opposition to science and [[liberal democracy]]. Examples include the [[creation-evolution controversy]], and controversies over the use of [[birth control]], the [[separation of church and state]], opposition to research into [[embryonic stem cell]]s, or theological objections to [[vaccination]], [[anesthesia]], and [[blood transfusion]]. <ref name=berlet1998>Berlet, Chip.

In his view, the Bible contains many injunctions against following one's conscience over scripture, and positive actions are supposed to originate not from compassion, but from the fear of punishment. <ref name="The God Delusion" /> Religious institutions typically declare they have special knowledge of [[moral absolutism|absolute morality]] and invoke this in order to hinder debates on many issues such as [[stem cell|stem cell research]], [[euthanasia]], and [[same-sex marriage]]. <ref name=bbcjuly2001 /><ref>{{Cite news| last = | first = | coauthors = | title =Vatican drive to curb gay marriage | work = | pages = | language =BBC News  | publisher = | date =2003-07-31 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3108349.stm | accessdate=2010-01-02}}</ref> . 

====Treatment of homosexuals====. 
[[File:20051129 northlake-il5.jpg|frame|A [[Westboro Baptist Church]] picket in Northlake, Illinois, US on November 29, 2005]]
{{Main|Homosexuality and religion}}
{{cquote2|If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.|[[Leviticus]] 20:13<nowiki>|</nowiki>[[King James Version of the Bible|KJV]]}} . 

Many [[major religions]], most prominently traditional [[Christianity and homosexuality|Christianity]], [[Homosexuality and Islam|Islam]], [[Homosexuality and Hinduism|Hinduism]] and [[Homosexuality and Judaism|Orthodox Judaism]], consider [[homosexuality]] immoral. Singer [[Elton John]] said organized religion promotes the [[Homophobia|hatred of homosexuals]]: "I think religion has always tried to turn hatred towards gay people... Organized religion does not seem to work. It turns people into really hateful [[lemming]]s and it's not really compassionate.''"<ref>{{Cite news| title=When Elton met Jake &#124; | work=[[The Observer]] url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,,1942193,00.html | location=London | date=13 November 2006}}</ref> . 

In the United States, conservative Christian groups such as the [[Christian Legal Society]] and the [[Alliance Defense Fund]] have filed numerous lawsuits against public universities, aimed at overturning policies that protect homosexuals from discrimination and [[hate speech]]. These groups argue that such policies infringe their right to freely exercise religion as guaranteed by the [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]]. <ref>{{Cite news| last=Simon | first=Stephanie | coauthors= | title=Christians Sue for Right Not to Tolerate Policies | work= | pages= | publisher=Los Angeles Times | date=10 April 2006 | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1018310011.html?dids=1018310011:1018310011&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Apr+10%2C+2006&author=Stephanie+Simon&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=A.1&desc=Christians+Sue+for+Right+Not+to+Tolerate+Policies |accessdate=  }}</ref> . 

Homosexuality is illegal in most Muslim countries, and in many of these countries carries the death penalty. In July 2005, [[Mahmoud Asgari and Ayaz Marhoni|two Iranian men]], aged sixteen and eighteen, were publicly hanged for homosexuality, causing an international outcry. Human rights organisations estimate that hundreds of people have been executed for homosexuality by Iranian authorities since the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 revolution]]. <ref>{{Cite news| last=Eke | first=Steven | coauthors = | title=Iran 'must stop youth executions' | wor = | pages= | language= | publisher=BBC News | date=28 July 2005 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4725959.stm | accessdate=2010-01-02}}</ref> . 

However, many liberal religious groups, and particularly most New Age religions, are accepting of homosexuals and do not regard their behavior as sinful, in particular: the [[Anglican Church of Canada]],<ref name="Christianity and homosexuality">[[Christianity and homosexuality]]</ref> the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America#Homosexuality|Episcopal Church]], [[Homosexuality and religion#Judaism|Progressive Judaism]], [[Moravian Church]],<ref name="Christianity and homosexuality"/> [[Homosexuality and religion#Neopagan religion|Neopaganism]], [[Raelism#Liberal views of sex|Raëlism]], the [[United Church of Canada#Beliefs and practices|United Church of Canada]], the [[Open and affirming|United Church of Christ]], [[Homosexuality and Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalism]], [[Homosexuality and Voodoo|Haitian Voodoo]], [[Homosexuality and Wicca|Wicca]], and the [[Metropolitan Community Church]], which was established almost specifically for this purpose.  . 

====Racism====. 
[[File:Burning-cross2.jpg|thumb|right||Cross often used by [[Ku Klux Klan]] to intimidate minorities]]
Religion has been used by some as justification for advocating [[racism]]. The [[Ku Klux Klan]], [[Christian Identity]] movement, [[Mormon]] leaders, and some Post-Medieval [[Theology|Theologians]]{{Who|date=May 2010}} have made claims that white people are closer to God than other races. Religious terrorist organizations such as the forenamed Ku Klux Klan, [[Kach and Kahane Chai]] and others also hold ostensibly racist views. <ref>{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | title =Foreign Terrorist Organizations | work = | publisher = US Office of Counterterrorism | date =2005-10-11 | url =http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/fs/37191.htm | doi =  | accessdate =  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last = Berlet |first = Chip |authorlink = Chip Berlet |year = 2004 |url = http://www.publiceye.org/rightist/idennlns.html |title = A New Face for Racism & Fascism  |work = White Supremacist, Antisemitic, and Race Hate Groups in the U.S.: A Geneaology |publisher = Political Research Associates   |accessdate = 2007-02-18}}</ref> There are arguments, however, that these positions may be as much reflections of contemporary social views as of what has been called [[scientific racism]]. <ref>"Ostensibly scientific": cf.

====Treatment of women====. 
[[File:Yemeni doctor.jpg|thumb|220px|left|In some Muslim countries, women wear [[hijab]]s or [[niqab]]s that conceal almost all of their bodies.]]
{{See also|Gender and religion|Misogyny}}
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2010}}
Critics{{who|date=January 2011}} say that religions often treat women in a discriminatory fashion, given them status inferior to men, depriving them of opportunities, endorsing excessive punishments, and using torture and executions as a manner of subjugating them.  . 

An example of such criticism is the treatment of women in modern [[Islam]], such as the required wearing of a [[burqa]] in some sects, or denying women permission to drive cars.  . 

Critics {{Who|date=May 2010}} also claim that Islam authorizes the punishment of female [[rape]] victims, citing a Saudi Arabian case where a rape victim was sentenced to receive 90 lashes because she was in a car with a man that was not her relative. <ref>{{cite web|title=Newspaper article on rape victim| url=http://www.news24.com/Content/World/News/1073/1a77b84a4491420e9e0cd45cba11cb4f/15-11-2007-02-08/Rape_victim_gets_200_lashes}}</ref> . 

Critics including Hitchens and the [[United Nations]] also say that Islam is used to justify unnecessary and usually harmful female [[genital modification and mutilation]], when the purposes range from depriving them of sexual satisfaction to discourage [[adultery]], insuring they are still a virgin to their husbands, or falsely giving the appearance that they are still a virgin. <ref name=Hitchens223/><ref name="unfpa.org">{{cite web| url=http://www.unfpa.org/public/News/pid/280 | title=Statement on the International Day Against Female Genital Mutilation | first=Thoraya |last=Ahmed Obaid | publisher = [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) | date=6 February 2007 | accessdate=2008-02-08 }}</ref> . 

=====Witch hunts=====. 
Another example is the use of [[witch trials]] by the [[Christian]] churches from 1480 through 1800.  These trials, often resulting in torture or death of the alleged witch, were based on the Old Testament in the [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:18, which prescribes "thou shalt not suffer a witch to live". Critics{{Who|reason=especially: what religion had these critics?|date=May 2010}} say that these trials were unfair, and that [[witchcraft]] was often not in evidence, and that the trials were generally used to punish assertive or independent women, such as [[midwife|midwives]],<ref>{{Cite book| last=Teijlingen |first= Edwin R.| title=Midwifery and the medicalization of childbirth: comparative perspectives|year=2004|publisher=Nova Publishers|page=46}}</ref> or [[activists]]. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Eller|first=Cynthia|title=Living in the lap of the Goddess: the feminist spirituality movement in America|year=1995|publisher=Beacon Press|pages=170–175}}</ref> . 

====Cruelty to animals====. 
[[File:Shechita.JPG|thumb|right|180px|[[Shechita]]]]

In 1893, animal advocates campaigning against kosher slaughter in Aberdeen attempted to link cruelty with Jewish religious practice. <ref name=Aberdeen>{{Cite journal|title=A Community on Trial: The Aberdeen Shechita Case, 1893|url=http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/jshs.2010.0103|first=Kenneth|last=Collins|journal=[[Journal of Scottish Historical Studies]]|volume=30|page=75|date=November 2010|doi=10.3366/jshs.2010.0103}}</ref> In the 1920s, Polish critics of kosher slaughter claimed that the practice actually had no basis in scripture. <ref name=Shechita-Poland/> In contrast, Jewish authorities argue that the slaughter methods are based directly upon Genesis IX:3, and that "these laws are binding on Jews today."<ref name=Chabad2/> . 

More recently, kosher slaughter has attracted criticism from some groups concerned with [[animal welfare]], who contend that the absence of any form of [[anesthesia]] or stunning prior to the severance of the animal's [[jugular vein]] causes unnecessary pain and suffering. Calls for the abolition of kosher slaughter have been made in 2008 by Germany's federal chamber of veterinarians,<ref name=Germany-Kosher>

Survey research suggests that believers do tend to hold different views than non-believers on a variety of social, ethical and moral questions. According to a 2003 survey conducted in the United States by [[The Barna Group]], a Christian-affiliated research organization, those who described themselves as believers were less likely than those describing themselves as atheists or agnostics to consider the following behaviors morally acceptable: [[cohabitation|cohabitating]] with someone of the opposite sex outside of marriage, enjoying sexual fantasies, having an [[abortion]], sexual relationships outside of marriage, [[gambling]], looking at [[pornography|pictures of nudity or explicit sexual behavior]], getting [[drunkeness|drunk]], and "[[homosexuality|having a sexual relationship with someone of the same sex]]."<ref name="Morality Continues to Decay">[http://web.archive.org/web/20040203202833/www.barna.org/cgi-bin/PagePressRelease.asp?PressReleaseID=152&Reference=F "The Barna Update: Morality Continues to Decay" (archive copy at the [[Internet Archive]])], [[The Barna Group]], November 3, 2003 ([http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/5-barna-update/129-morality-continues-to-decay "The Barna Update: Morality Continues to Decay" – Summary version posted on the Barna website])</ref> . 

Moreover, a comprehensive study by [[Harvard University]] professor [[Robert Putnam]] found that religious people are more charitable than their irreligious counterparts. <ref name="Relgion & Charity">{{cite web|url = http://pewforum.org/Religion-News/Religious-people-make-better-citizens-study-says.aspx|title =Religious people make better citizens, study says |publisher = [[Pew Research Center]]|quote=The scholars say their studies found that religious people are three to four times more likely to be involved in their community. They are more apt than nonreligious Americans to work on community projects, belong to voluntary associations, attend public meetings, vote in local elections, attend protest demonstrations and political rallies, and donate time and money to causes -- including secular ones. At the same time, Putnam and Campbell say their data show that religious people are just "nicer": they carry packages for people, don't mind folks cutting ahead in line and give money to panhandlers.|accessdate = 2007–10–18}}</ref><ref name="better neighbors">{{cite news | title =Religious people are 'better neighbors'| work = [[USA Today]] | url = http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/2010-11-15-column15_ST_N.htm | quote=However, on the other side of the ledger, religious people are also "better neighbors" than their secular counterparts. No matter the civic activity, being more religious means being more involved. Take, for example, volunteer work. Compared with people who never attend worship services, those who attend weekly are more likely to volunteer in religious activities (no surprise there), but also for secular causes. The differences between religious and secular Americans can be dramatic. Forty percent of worship-attending Americans volunteer regularly to help the poor and elderly, compared with 15% of Americans who never attend services. Frequent-attenders are also more likely than the never-attenders to volunteer for school and youth programs (36% vs. 15%), a neighborhood or civic group (26% vs. 13%), and for health care (21% vs. 13%). The same is true for philanthropic giving; religious Americans give more money to secular causes than do secular Americans. And the list goes on, as it is true for good deeds such as helping someone find a job, donating blood, and spending time with someone who is feeling blue. Furthermore, the "religious edge" holds up for organized forms of community involvement: membership in organizations, working to solve community problems, attending local meetings, voting in local elections, and working for social or political reform. On this last point, it is not just that religious people are advocating for right-leaning causes, although many are. Religious liberals are actually more likely to be community activists than are religious conservatives.|accessdate = 2007–10–18|first1=David|last1=Campbell|first2=Robert|last2=Putnam|date=2010-11-14}}</ref> The study revealed that forty percent of [[service of worship|worship service]] attending Americans volunteer regularly to help the poor and elderly as opposed to 15% of Americans who never attend services. <ref name="Relgion & Charity"/> Moreover, religious individuals are more likely than non-religious individuals to volunteer for school and youth programs (36% vs. 15%), a neighborhood or civic group (26% vs. 13%), and for health care (21% vs. 13%). <ref name="Relgion & Charity"/> . 

===Counterarguments===. 
Religious apologists often respond that those guilty of such actions are merely misguided [[extremists]] and don't represent mainstream religion, or that such things are only exceptions and that, by and large, religion is a positive civilizing influence on society.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Atheists such as [[Hector Avalos]] counter that this may be a [[No true Scotsman]] [[logical fallacy|fallacy]] in that apologists may decide which believers are considered "mainstream" and which are "extremist" on a basis that favors their position. <ref>{{cite web |first=Austin |last=Cline |url= http://atheism.about.com/od/religiousviolencemyths/a/HijackReligion.htm |title=Myth: Religious Extremists Hijack True Religion, Give Religion a Bad Name |publisher=atheism.about.com |accessdate= 2 February 2009}}</ref> .

==Corrupt purposes of leaders==. 
Many criticisms of religion focus on the purposes of the leaders of the religions, rather than on the religious doctrines. Critics{{Who|date=September 2010}} point out that many religions endow their leaders with immoral or corrupt authority, and that leaders often [[abuse of power|abuse the power]] for financial gain, or increased access to sexual partners, or to oppress minorities or enemies. Critics{{Who|date=September 2010}} claim that religious leaders have often supported un-democratic and oppressive power structures, such as the absolutist monarchies of Europe, or the Pharaohs of ancient Egypt.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} . 

===Corrupt or immoral leaders===. 
[[File:In memoriam brigham young 2.jpg|thumb|right|Caricature of [[Mormon]] leader [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young's]] wives]]
Critics{{Who|date=November 2009}} point out that several religions were founded by individuals who appeared to be using the religion for immoral or corrupt purposes, such as financial gain, access to power, or justifying multiple wives.  Examples given by critics include Indian mystic [[Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh]] who owned 90 [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls Royce]] cars, cult leader [[David Koresh]], and [[Mormon]] leaders [[Joseph Smith]] who had about 27 wives and [[Brigham Young]] who had about 57 wives. <ref>{{Cite book|title=God is not Great |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens | pages=155–169}}</ref>  [[Roman Catholic]] pope [[Alexander VI]] (of the [[House of Borgia|Borgia family]]) was noted for his many mistresses, [[syphilis]] and [[nepotism]].  [[Evangelical Christian]] pastor [[Jim Bakker]] was convicted of fraud for improperly using large amounts of money from his congregation for personal use.  . 

===Authoritarian political power===. 
{{See also|Theocracy|Censorship by religion}}
The term "[[authoritarian]]" is used to describe an organization, an institution, or a state that enforces strong and sometimes oppressive measures against those within its sphere of influence, generally without any attempt at gaining their consent and often not allowing criticism of its policies.  . 

In this sense, some religious organizations can be seen as authoritarian, insofar as their goal is to define themselves as the ultimate authority by which the law of the land is granted.{{Dubious|date=September 2010}} As this divine source of authority is not to be criticized by non-religious arguments, it is the antithesis to [[secularism]].{{Dubious|date=September 2010}} A country where the above has been achieved is called a [[theocracy]]. <ref>{{cite web| last =Driscoll | first =James F  | authorlink = | title =The Catholic Encyclopedia – Theocracy  | work =  | publisher =New Advent | date = | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14568a.htm | doi = | accessdate =  }}</ref> . 

Some religions also teach that there was, or is, a human with divinity or touched by divine guidance, and who is therefore infallible: for example [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]] and, in certain circumstances, the [[Pope]].  . 

===Divine mandate used for political gain===. 
{{See also|Imperial cult}}
The [[ancient egypt]]ians believed that upon taking the throne, the [[pharaoh]] became the earthly embodiment of a god. They believed that in his role as both man and god, he was responsible for preserving not only the empire, but the universe itself. <ref>{{Cite book|first=Regine |last=Schulz |title=Egypt: The World of the Pharaohs |publisher=Könemann |location=Köln |year= 1998|pages= |isbn=3-89508-913-3 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> . 

Until the end of [[World War II]] the [[Emperor of Japan]] held a similar status,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Large|first=Stephen S.|title=Emperor Hirohito and Showa Japan: A Political Biography|year=1992|publisher=Routledge|page=60}}</ref> and [[Imperial cult|deification]] of Roman emperors was common practice following the reign of [[Augustus]]. <ref>{{cite web|title= The imperial cult|first=Nigel |last=Pollard|publisher=BBC History| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/roman_religion_gallery_06.shtml}}</ref> Systems such as this equated political opposition to heresy, and served to support existing power structures by suppressing dissent.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}  On New Year's Day 1946, [[Hirohito|Emperor Hirohito]] (formally) declined claims of divinity with the [[Humanity Declaration]].  . 

===Dominionism===. 
{{Main|Dominionism}}
{{See also|Dominion Theology|Christian Reconstructionism}}
The term [[dominionism]] is often used to describe a political movement among [[fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christians]]. Critics view dominionism as an attempt to improperly impose Christianity as the national faith of the United States. It emerged in the late 1980s inspired by the book, film and lecture series, "Whatever Happened to the Human Race?" by [[Francis Schaeffer|Francis A. Schaeffer]] and [[C. Everett Koop]]. <ref>{{Cite book| last =Diamond | first =Sara | authorlink =Sara Diamond |  title =Spiritual Warfare: The Politics of the Christian Right | publisher =[[South End Press]] | year =1989 | location =Boston | pages = | doi =  | id =  }}</ref>  Schaeffer's views influenced conservatives like [[Jerry Falwell]], [[Tim LaHaye]], [[Rutherford Institute|John W. Whitehead]], and although they represent different theological and political ideas, dominionists believe they have a Christian duty to take "control of a sinful secular society", either by putting fundamentalist Christians in office, or by introducing biblical law into the secular sphere. <ref name=berlet1998 /><ref>{{Cite book| last =Ansell | first=Amy E | authorlink = | title =Unraveling the Right: The New Conservatism in American Thought and Politics | publisher =Westview Press | year =1998 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | isbn=0-8133-3147-1  }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| last =Schaeffer | first =Francis | authorlink =Francis Schaeffer | coauthors = | title =A Christian Manifesto | publisher =Crossway Books | year =1982  | location = | pages = | url = | doi = |  isbn=0-89107-233-0  }}</ref>  Social scientists have used the word "dominionism" to refer to adherence to [[Dominion Theology]]<ref name="Barron1992a">{{cite book | last=Barron | first=Bruce | year=1992 | title=Heaven on Earth?

Once we acknowledge the similarity between conservative Christians and fascists, Hedges appears to suggest, we can confront Christian evil by setting aside 'the old polite rules of democracy.' So wild conspiracy theories and visions of genocide are really excuses for the Left to disregard the rules of democracy and defeat conservative Christians — by any means necessary. <ref name="Kurtz2005b"/></blockquote> .
