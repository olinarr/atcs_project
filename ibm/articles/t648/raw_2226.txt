'''Atheism''', in a broad sense, is the rejection of [[belief]] in the [[Existence of God|existence of deities]]. <ref>

Instead of saying that an atheist is someone who believes that it is false or probably false that there is a God, a more adequate characterization of atheism consists in the more complex claim that to be an atheist is to be someone who rejects belief in God for the following reasons (which reason is stressed depends on how God is being conceived)...}}

It is common among contemporary philosophers, and indeed it was not uncommon in earlier centuries, to reject positions on the ground that they are meaningless. Sometimes, too, a theory is rejected on such grounds as that it is sterile or redundant or capricious, and there are many other considerations which in certain contexts are generally agreed to constitute good grounds for rejecting an assertion.}}(page 175 in 1967 edition)

|quote=As commonly understood, atheism is the position that affirms the nonexistence of God. So an atheist is someone who disbelieves in God, whereas a theist is someone who believes in God. Another meaning of "atheism" is simply nonbelief in the existence of God, rather than positive belief in the nonexistence of God. …an atheist, in the broader sense of the term, is someone who disbelieves in every form of deity, not just the God of traditional Western theology.}}
</ref>
Most inclusively, atheism is simply the absence of belief that any deities exist. <ref>[[Religioustolerance.org]]'s short article on [http://www.religioustolerance.org/atheist4.htm Definitions of the term "Atheism"] suggests that there is no consensus on the definition of the term. [[Simon Blackburn]] summarizes the situation in [[The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]: "Atheism. Either the lack of belief in a god, or the belief that there is none". Most dictionaries (see the OneLook query for [http://www.onelook.com/?w=atheism&ls=a "atheism"]) first list one of the more narrow definitions.

==Rejection of theistic arguments==. 
The primary criticism of atheism is that it rejects belief in [[God]], for whose existence [[theism|theist]] and [[deism|deist]] critics<ref>See e.g. [[Alvin Plantinga]], who suggests that belief in God is like belief in other minds in this respect, in his ''God and Other Minds'', Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1967; rev. ed., 1990. ISBN 0-8014-9735-3</ref> believe there are well-established [[Arguments for the existence of God|arguments]]. Atheists, however, regard the arguments for the existence of God as unconvincing or flawed. <ref>See e.g. {{Cite book| last=Dawkins | first=Richard | authorlink=Richard Dawkins | coauthors= | title=[[The God Delusion]] | publisher=[[Bantam Books]] | year =2006 | location =Ch.3 | pages = | url = | doi = | isbn =0-618-68000-4 }} and {{Cite book| last=Harris | first=Sam | authorlink = | coauthors= | title=The End of Faith | publisher=W.W.

Criticism of [[Negative and positive atheism|strong atheism]] also comes from [[agnostics]], who contend that there are insufficient grounds to assert authoritatively that any supreme being does not exist,<ref name="Kenny">[[Anthony Kenny]] ''What I Believe'' see esp. Ch. 3 "Why I am not an atheist"</ref> and from [[ignosticism|ignostics]], who take the [[theological noncognitivism|theological noncognitivist]] position that the ''question'' of the existence of God (per that definition) is meaningless or not properly defined to allow one to take a meaningful position on. [[Negative and positive atheism|Negative atheism]] (sometimes referred to as weak atheism) is compatible with both agnosticism and theological noncognitivism.  .

[[Emblem book|Emblem]] illustrating practical atheism and its historical association with immorality, titled "Supreme Impiety: Atheist and Charlatan", from ''Picta poesis'', by [[Barthélemy Aneau]], 1552.]]
Some philosophers and world religions teach that morality is derived from or expressed by the dictates or commandments of a particular deity, and that acknowledgment of God or the gods is a major factor in motivating people towards moral behavior. The [[German idealism|German idealist]] philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] stated the practical necessity for a belief in God in his ''[[Critique of Practical Reason]]''. As an idea of pure reason, "we do not have the slightest ground to assume in an absolute manner… the object of this idea…",<ref name = "CPR A685 B713">Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, A685/B713. </ref> but adds that the idea of God cannot be separated from the relation of happiness with morality as the "ideal of the supreme good." The foundation of this connection is an intelligible moral world, and "is necessary from the practical point of view". <ref name = "CPR A810 B838">Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, A810/B838. </ref> The French ''philosophe'' [[Voltaire]] stated "If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him."<ref>Originally, "Si Dieu n'existait pas, il faudrait l'inventer.", [[q:Voltaire|]], Épître à l'Auteur du Livre des Trois Imposteurs (1770-11-10). </ref> .

He states that based on historical observation and studies performed by his colleagues at [[Harvard University]] that there is "no question there’s a connection between religion and economic and social behaviour" and he is "strongly convinced that religion performs important social functions in the transmission say, of ethical values between generations" and without it exists "a society that’s likely to be less good at maintaining social order". <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3618721/Heaven-knows-how-well-rekindle-our-religion-but-I-believe-we-must.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Heaven knows how we'll rekindle our religion, but I believe we must | first=Niall | last=Ferguson | date=2005-07-31}}</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/8.30/relrpt/stories/s1603430.htm Niall Ferguson on Islam and demographics]</ref> 
Historically, practical atheism or [[apatheism]] — which describes individuals who live as if there are no gods and explain natural phenomena without resorting to the divine — has been associated by various theistic writers with depravity, willful ignorance, impiety, and [[hedonism]]. According to the French Catholic philosopher [[Étienne Borne]], "Practical atheism is not the denial of the existence of God, but complete godlessness of action; it is a moral evil, implying not the denial of the absolute validity of the moral law but simply rebellion against that law."<ref name="Borne 1961">{{Cite book|last=Borne |first=Étienne
|title=Atheism |year=1961 |publisher=New York: Hawthorn Books |isbn=0-415-04727-7}}</ref>  For many years in the United States, atheists were not allowed to testify in court because it was believed that an atheist would have no reason to tell the truth (see also [[discrimination against atheists]]). <ref>''See, e.g.'', United States v. Miller, 236 F. 798, 799 (W.D. Wash., N.D. 1916) (citing Thurston v. Whitney et al., 2 Cush. (Mass.) 104; Jones on Evidence, Blue Book, vol. 4, §§ 712, 713) ("Under the common-law rule a person who does not believe in a God who is the rewarder of truth and the avenger of falsehood cannot be permitted to testify.")</ref> . 

Some believe that a moral sense does not  depend on religious belief. The [[Dalai Lama]] has said that compassion and affection are human values independent of religion: "We need these human values. I call these [[secular ethics]], secular beliefs. There’s no relationship with any particular religion. Even without religion, even as nonbelievers, we have the capacity to promote these things."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.progressive.org/mag_intv0106 |title=The Dalai Lama Interview &#124; The Progressive Magazine since 1909 |publisher=Progressive.org |date=1935-07-06 |accessdate=2009-04-11}}</ref> Atheists such as biologist and popular author [[Richard Dawkins]] have proposed that human morality is a result of evolutionary, sociobiological history. He proposes that the "[[The God Delusion|moral zeitgeist]]" helps describe how moral imperatives and values naturalistically evolve over time from biological and cultural origins. <ref name='God_Delusion7'>{{Cite book| last = Dawkins | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Dawkins | coauthors = | title = The God Delusion | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | date = 2006-09-18| location = Ch. 7| url = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_Delusion | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0618680009 |ref=harv}}</ref> . 

According to the [[Catholic Church]], human reason, even without knowledge of a [[revelation|revealed]] [[divine law]], inclines people to seek the good and avoid sin.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} In this view, [[natural law]] provides a foundation on which people may build moral rules to guide their choices and regulate society, but does not provide as strong a basis for moral behavior as a morality that is based in religion. <ref>"Where morality is divorced from religion, reason will, it is true, enable a man to recognize to a large extent the ideal to which his nature points. But much will be wanting. He will disregard some of his most essential duties. He will, further, be destitute of the strong motives for obedience to the law afforded by the sense of obligation to God and the knowledge of the tremendous sanction attached to its neglect – motives which experience has proved to be necessary as a safeguard against the influence of the passions. And, finally, his actions even if in accordance with the moral law, will be based not on the obligation imposed by the Divine will, but on considerations of human dignity and on the good of human society."{{CathEncy|wstitle=Morality}}</ref> [[Douglas Wilson (theologian)|Douglas Wilson]] argues that while atheists can behave morally, belief is necessary for an individual "to give a rational and coherent account" of why they are obligated to lead a morally responsible life. <ref>[[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Douglas Wilson (theologian)|Douglas Wilson]], [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/article_print.html?id=44990 "Is Christianity Good for the World?

==Atheism as faith==. 
{{See|Secular religion}}
{{Expand section|date=February 2010}}
Atheism has been criticized as a faith in itself, with some defining it as a belief in its own right, with a certainty about the falseness of religious beliefs that is comparable to the certainty about the unknown that is practiced by religions themselves. <ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,800631,00.html "Religion: The God-Haters,"] ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', August 22, 1949</ref><ref>David Limbaugh, [http://townhall.com/columnists/DavidLimbaugh/2004/04/20/does_atheism_require_more_faith "Does atheism require more faith?,"] Townhall.com, April 20, 2004</ref><ref>Stanley Fish, [http://fish.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/06/17/atheism-and-evidence/ "Atheism and Evidence,"] Think Again, ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 17, 2007</ref><ref>DHRUV K.

Also, a belief is not necessarily a belief without evidence or firm foundation. For example a belief can be in contrast to faith because the holder of the belief might not hold it with a complete degree of being certain it is true but only as far as the evidence pertains to the belief being true. <ref>[http://atheism.about.com/library/glossary/general/bldef_belief.htm Belief]</ref> . 

In his book ''First Principles'' (1862), the 19th-century English philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]] has a chapter on "Ultimate Religious Ideas" in which he writes that, as regards the origin of the universe, three hypotheses are possible: self-existence (atheism), self-creation (pantheism) or creation by an external agency (theism). <ref>Spencer, Herbert (1862). ''First Principles''. London: Williams and Norgate, pp. 30-35. </ref> Analyzing these three hypotheses, however, Spencer finds that, "differing so widely as they seem to do", they all "contain the same ultimate element. It is impossible to avoid making the assumption of self-existence somewhere",<ref>Spencer, ''First Principles'', p. 36. </ref> whether with regard to a part of the universe (atheism), the universe as a whole (pantheism), or an external creator (theism). Furthermore, the idea of self-existence is not merely inescapable but "rigorously inconceivable; and this holds true whatever be the nature of the object of which it is predicated". For Spencer, therefore, atheism, pantheism and theism alike, despite "seeming to their adherents quite rational, turn out, when critically examined, to be literally unthinkable". <ref>Spencer, ''First Principles'', p. 35. </ref> In view of its inability to evade assuming self-existence somewhere, "even that which is commonly regarded as the negation of all religion — even positive Atheism comes within the definition" of religion. <ref>Spencer, ''First Principles'', p. 43. </ref> .

The true [[scientist]], however passionately he may 'believe', in [[evolution]] for example, knows exactly what would change his mind: evidence! The fundamentalist knows that nothing will."<ref>Richard Dawkins, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article1779771.ece "How dare you call me a fundamentalist: The right to criticize ‘faith-heads’,"] ''[[The Times]]'', May 12, 2007</ref> .

Former atheist [[Ignace Lepp]] states "some modern atheists are unquestionably neurotics" which he bases typically on an unhappy experience with religion. <ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,896909,00.html | work=Time | title=Atheism: The Varieties of Non-Religious Experience | date=1963-07-19 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref> Neuroscientist and popular author [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] has been criticized by some of his fellow contributors at ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.  In particular, [[RJ Eskow]] has accused him of fostering an [[Religious intolerance|intolerance]] towards [[faith]], potentially as damaging as the [[religious fanaticism|religious]] [[fanaticism]] which he opposes. <ref name="Eskow 2005">RJ Eskow, 2005.

''The Huffington Post''. </ref>  [[Madeleine Bunting]] wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that the purpose of recent books by the so-called "[[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse|Four Horsemen]]" of the New Atheism—Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens—"is to pour scorn on religious belief—they want it eradicated," and argues that the books are "deeply political," sharing a "loathing" of the role of religion in American culture and politics.  Quoting Harris as saying "some propositions are so dangerous that it may even be ethical to kill people for believing them," Bunting says "[t]his sounds like exactly the kind of argument put forward by those who ran the Inquisition."<ref>[[Madeleine Bunting]], [http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/may/07/comment.religion "The New Atheists loathe religion far too much to plausibly challenge it,"] ''[[The Guardian]]'', May 7, 2007</ref>  Quoting the same passage, [[theology|theologian]] [[Catherine Keller (theologian)|Catherine Keller]] asks, "[c]ould there be a more dangerous proposition than ''that''?" and argues that the "anti-tolerance" it represents would "dismantle" the Jeffersonian wall between church and state. <ref>[[Catherine Keller (theologian)|Catherine Keller]], page 5, ''On the Mystery: Discerning Divinity in Process'', Fortress Press (January 1, 2008), ISBN 978-0800662769, 160 pages; italics in the original</ref> . 

Sam Harris has responded at length to these criticisms, stating that this "passage seems to have been selectively quoted, and misconstrued, more than any I have written". He further states that "This paragraph appears after a long discussion of the role that belief plays in governing human behavior, and it should be read in that context." "Some critics have interpreted the second sentence of this passage to mean that I advocate simply killing religious people for their beliefs." "Such a reading remains a frank distortion of my views. Read in context, it should be clear that I am not at all ignoring the link between belief and behavior. The fact that belief determines behavior is what makes certain beliefs so dangerous." Using the examples of [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Ayman Al Zawahiri]], he states the view that even though they had not killed anyone personally, it would still be ethical to target them because "they are likely to get a lot of innocent people killed because of what they and their followers believe about jihad, martyrdom, the ascendancy of Islam, etc."<ref>[http://www.samharris.org/site/full_text/response-to-controversy2/ Response to Controversy : Sam Harris]</ref> . 

In December 2007, the [[Archbishop of Wales]] [[Barry Morgan]] criticized what he referred to as "atheistic fundamentalism", claiming that it advocated  the view that religion has no substance and "that faith has no value and is superstitious nonsense."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.churchinwales.org.uk/press/display_press_release.php?prid=4542 |title=Yr Eglwys yng Nghymru |publisher=The Church in Wales |date= |accessdate=2009-04-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7156783.stm |title=Wales &#124; 'Atheistic fundamentalism' fears |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-12-22 |accessdate=2009-04-11}}</ref> He claimed that atheistic fundamentalism led to situations such as councils calling Christmas "[[Winterval]]", schools refusing to put on nativity plays and crosses removed from chapels, though others have disputed this. <ref>{{Cite news|author=Logged in as click here to log out |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/christmas2007/story/0,,2230951,00.html |title=Sorry to disappoint, but it's nonsense to suggest we want to ban Christmas &#124; Special reports &#124; Guardian Unlimited |publisher=Guardian |date= 2007-12-21|accessdate=2009-04-11 | location=London}}</ref> . 

As a theistic religion, [[Christianity]] necessarily rejects atheism. While the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]  identifies atheism as a violation of the [[First Commandment]], calling it  "a sin against the [[virtue of religion]]", it is careful to acknowledge that atheism may be motivated by [[virtue|virtuous]] or [[moral]] considerations, and admonishes [[Catholic Church|Catholic Christians]] to focus on their own role in encouraging atheism by their religious or moral shortcomings:
:(2125) [...] ''The imputability of this offense can be significantly diminished in virtue of the intentions and the circumstances. "Believers can have more than a little to do with the rise of atheism. To the extent that they are careless about their instruction in the faith, or present its teaching falsely, or even fail in their religious, moral, or social life, they must be said to conceal rather than to reveal the true nature of God and of religion.''<ref name="catechism "/> .

One criticism of atheism is that godless nations have been responsible for aggressive campaigns against religions or religious people. [[Pope Benedict XVI]], for example, stated in 2010: <blockquote>As we reflect on the sobering lessons of the atheist extremism of the 20th century, let us never forget how the exclusion of God, religion and virtue from public life leads ultimately to a truncated vision of man and of society and thus to a "reductive vision of the person and his destiny"<ref name="pope">{{cite web|last=Pope Benedict XVI|title= Meeting with state authorities in the grounds of the Palace of Holyroodhouse|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/unitedkingdom10/resource.php?res_id=1438|accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref></blockquote>
While research suggests that atheists are more numerous in peaceful nations than they are in turbulent or warlike ones,<ref>Tom Rees. [http://epiphenom.fieldofscience.com/2009/06/atheist-nations-are-more-peaceful.html Atheist nations are more peaceful], Epiphenom.com. Retrieved September 16, 2010</ref> proponents of this view cite examples, such as the [[Bolshevik]]s (in Soviet Russia), who, inspired by "an ideological creed which professed that all religion would atrophy", "resolved to eradicate Christianity as such". In 1918 "[t]en [[Russian Orthodox|Orthodox]] hierarchs were summarily shot" and "[c]hildren were deprived of any religious education outside the home."<ref>[[Michael Burleigh]] ''Sacred Causes'' HarperCollins (2006) p41, p42, p43</ref> Increasingly draconian measures were employed. In addition to direct state persecution, the [[Society of the Godless|League of the Militant Godless]] was founded in 1925, churches were closed and vandalized and "by 1938 eighty bishops had lost their lives, while thousands of clerics were sent to labour camps."<ref>Burleigh op. cit. p49 and p47</ref> . 

In 1967, [[Enver Hoxha]]'s regime conducted a [[Enver Hoxha#Religion|campaign]] to extinguish religious life in [[Albania]]; by year's end over two thousand religious buildings were closed or converted to other uses, and religious leaders were imprisoned and executed. Albania was declared to be the world's first atheist country by its leaders, and Article 37 of the Albanian constitution of 1976 stated that "The State recognises no religion, and supports and carries out atheistic propaganda in order to implant a scientific materialistic world outlook in people."<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of Albanian Religion, Mythology, and Folk Culture |last=Elsie |first=R. |coauthors= |year=2000 |publisher=NYU Press |location=New York |isbn=0814722148 |url= |page=18 }}</ref><ref>David Binder, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5DE1F3AF937A25756C0A966958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all "Evolution in Europe; Albanian Leader Says the Country Will Be Democratized but Will Retain Socialism,"] [[The New York Times]], May 14, 1990</ref><ref>[http://guida-shqiptare.net/turizem/English/historia.htm Colombo Travel Agency<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Dead link|date=October 2009}}</ref> . 

Christian writer [[Dinesh D'Souza]] writes that "The crimes of atheism have generally been perpetrated through a hubristic ideology that sees man, not God, as the creator of values. Using the latest techniques of science and technology, man seeks to displace God and create a secular [[utopia]] here on earth."<ref name="D'Souza 1">[http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1121/p09s01-coop.html Atheism, not religion, is the real force behind the mass murders of history] Dinesh D'Souza</ref> He also contends:
<blockquote>And who can deny that [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and [[Mao Zedong|Mao]], not to mention [[Pol Pot]] and a host of others, all committed atrocities in the name of a Communist ideology that was explicitly atheistic? Who can dispute that they did their bloody deeds by claiming to be establishing a 'new man' and a religion-free utopia? These were mass murders performed with atheism as a central part of their ideological inspiration, they were not mass murders done by people who simply happened to be atheist. <ref name="D'Souza 2">[http://catholiceducation.org/articles/apologetics/ap0214.htm Answering Atheist’s Arguments] Dinesh D'Souza</ref></blockquote> . 

In response to this line of criticism, [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] wrote:
<blockquote>The problem with fascism and communism, however, is not that they are too critical of religion; the problem is that they are too much like religions. Such regimes are dogmatic to the core and generally give rise to personality cults that are indistinguishable from cults of religious hero worship. [[Auschwitz]], the [[gulag]] and the killing fields were not examples of what happens when human beings reject religious dogma; they are examples of political, racial and nationalistic dogma run amok. There is no society in human history that ever suffered because its people became too reasonable. <ref>[http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/harris06/harris06_index.html 10 myths and 10 truths about Atheism] Sam Harris</ref></blockquote> . 

Richard Dawkins has stated that Stalin's atrocities were influenced not by atheism but by dogmatic [[Marxism]],<ref name='God_Delusion7' /> and concludes that while Stalin and Mao happened to be atheists, they did not do their deeds in the name of atheism. <ref>Interview with Richard Dawkins conducted by Stephen Sackur for BBC News 24’s HardTalk programme, July 24th 2007. [http://richarddawkins.net/article,1454,Richard-Dawkins-on-Hardtalk,BBC-Richard-Dawkins]</ref> On other occasions, Dawkins has replied to the argument that [[Adolf Hitler]] and Josef Stalin were antireligious with the response that Hitler and Stalin also grew moustaches, in an effort to show the argument as fallacious. <ref>[http://richarddawkins.net/articles/915 The Video: Bill O'Reilly Interviews Richard Dawkins]</ref> Instead, Dawkins argues in ''[[The God Delusion]]'' that "What matters is not whether Hitler and Stalin were atheists, but whether atheism systematically influences people to do bad things. There is not the smallest evidence that it does."<ref>{{Harvnb|Dawkins|2006|page=309}}</ref> D'Souza responds that an individual need not explicitly invoke atheism in committing atrocities if it is already implied in his worldview, as is the case in Marxism. <ref name="D'Souza 2"/> .
