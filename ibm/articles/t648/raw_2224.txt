'''Atheism''' is, in a broad sense, the rejection of [[belief]] in the [[Existence of God|existence of deities]]. <ref name=Nielsen-EB/> In a narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no [[deity|deities]]. <ref name=RoweRoutledge/><ref name=oxdicphil/> Most inclusively, atheism is simply the absence of belief that any deities exist. <ref name=oxdicphil/><ref name=religioustolerance/>
Atheism is contrasted with [[theism]],<ref name=reldef/><ref name=OED-theism />
which in its most general form is the belief that at least one deity exists. <ref name=OED-theism>{{cite book |title=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=2nd |year=1989 |quote=Belief in a deity, or deities, as opposed to atheism}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/theism |title=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |quote=belief in the existence of a god or gods | accessdate=2011-04-09}}</ref> . 

The term ''atheism'' originated from the Greek {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἄθεος|ἄθεος]]}} (''atheos''), meaning "without god", used as a pejorative term applied to those thought to reject the [[gods]] worshipped by the larger society. With the spread of [[freethought]], [[skeptical inquiry]], and subsequent increase in [[criticism of religion]], application of the term narrowed in scope. The first individuals to identify themselves using the word "atheist" lived in the 18th century. <ref name=KArmstrong/> . 

Atheists tend to be [[skepticism|skeptical]] of [[supernatural]] claims, citing a lack of [[Existence of God#Empirical arguments|empirical evidence]].{{Verify source|date=March 2012}} Rationales for not believing in any deity include the [[problem of evil]], the [[argument from inconsistent revelations]], and the [[argument from nonbelief]].

Philosophers such as [[Georges Bataille]], [[Slavoj Žižek]],<ref>Slavoj Žižek: Less Than Nothing (2012)</ref> [[Alain de Botton]],<ref>Alain de Botton: Religion for Atheists (2012)</ref> and [[Alexander Bard]] & [[Jan Söderqvist]]<ref>Alexander Bard & Jan Söderqvist: The Global Empire (2012)</ref> have all argued that atheists should reclaim religion as an act of defiance against theism, precisely not to leave religion as an unwarranted  monopoly to theists. Bataille set out to do this with his ''Atheology'' project in 1952-53 and de Botton returns to the idea in his work ''Religion for Atheists'' (2012). Such projects are often referred to as ''atheological'' rather than atheist to differentiate them from ''secular atheism''. de Botton even calls his philosophy Atheism 2.0<ref>http://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_atheism_2_0.html</ref> to underline the difference between Atheology and Secular Atheism.  .

==Etymology and usage==. 
[[File:Ephesians 2,12 - Greek atheos.jpg|thumb|left|The Greek word {{lang|grc|αθεοι}} (''atheoi''), as it appears in the [[Epistle to the Ephesians]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Ephesians|2:12}}) on the early 3rd-century [[Papyrus 46]]. It is usually translated into English as "[those who are] without God". <ref>The word {{lang|grc|αθεοι}}—in any of its forms—appears nowhere else in the [[Septuagint]] or the [[New Testament]]. {{cite book |last=Robertson |first=A.T. |title=Word Pictures in the New Testament |origyear=1932 |year=1960 |publisher=Broadman Press |chapter=Ephesians: Chapter 2 |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/r/robertson_at/wordpictures/htm/EPH2.RWP.html |quote=Old Greek word, not in LXX, only here in N.T. Atheists in the original sense of being without God and also in the sense of hostility to God from failure to worship him. See Paul's words in Ro 1:18–32. | accessdate=2011-04-09}}
</ref>]] . 

In early [[ancient Greek]], the adjective ''{{Transl|grc|atheos}}'' ({{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἄθεος|ἄθεος]]}}, from the [[privative a|privative ἀ-]] + {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:θεός|θεός]]}} "god") meant "godless". It was first used as a term of censure roughly meaning "ungodly" or "impious". In the 5th century BCE, the word began to indicate more deliberate and active godlessness in the sense of "severing relations with the gods" or "denying the gods". The term [[:wikt:ἀσεβής|ἀσεβής]] (''{{Transl|grc|asebēs}}'') then came to be applied against those who impiously denied or disrespected the local gods, even if they believed in other gods. Modern translations of classical texts sometimes render ''{{Transl|grc|atheos}}'' as "atheistic". As an abstract noun, there was also {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἀθεότης|ἀθεότης]]}} (''{{Transl|grc|atheotēs}}''), "atheism". [[Cicero]] transliterated the Greek word into the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|[[:wikt:atheos#Latin|atheos]]}}''. The term found frequent use in the debate between [[early Christianity|early Christians]] and [[Ancient Greek religion|Hellenists]], with each side attributing it, in the pejorative sense, to the other. <ref name=drachmann>{{cite book |last=Drachmann |first=A.

Nevertheless they are not Greek; their formation is not consonant with Greek usage. In Greek they said ''{{Transl |grc |atheos}}'' and ''{{Transl |grc |atheotēs}}''; to these the English words ungodly and ungodliness correspond rather closely. In exactly the same way as ungodly, ''{{Transl |grc |atheos}}'' was used as an expression of severe censure and moral condemnation; this use is an old one, and the oldest that can be traced. Not till later do we find it employed to denote a certain philosophical creed.}}

atheist meant not accepting the current conception of the divine. <ref>http://www.foothill.edu/attach/bss/schaefers.ch9.pt2.ppt</ref> . 

''Atheism'' was first used to describe a self-avowed belief in late 18th-century Europe, specifically denoting disbelief in the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[Abrahamic god]]. <ref name="adevism">In part because of its wide use in monotheistic Western society, ''atheism'' is usually described as "disbelief in God", rather than more generally as "disbelief in deities". A clear distinction is rarely drawn in modern writings between these two definitions, but some archaic uses of ''atheism'' encompassed only disbelief in the singular God, not in [[polytheism|polytheistic]] deities. It is on this basis that the obsolete term ''[[adevism]]'' was coined in the late 19th century to describe an absence of belief in plural deities. {{cite journal |author=Britannica |title=Atheonism |journal=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |edition=11th |year=1911 |ref=harv}}

In the 20th century, [[globalization]] contributed to the expansion of the term to refer to disbelief in all deities, though it remains common in Western society to describe atheism as simply "disbelief in God". <ref name="mmartin">Martin, Michael.

Some atheists have doubted the very need for the term "atheism". In his book ''[[Letter to a Christian Nation]]'', [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] wrote:

contesting what supernatural entities it applies to, whether it is an assertion in its own right or merely the absence of one, and whether it requires a conscious, explicit rejection. However, it is generally contrasted with [[agnosticism]]. <ref name=agnosticism-contrast/> A variety of categories have been proposed to try to distinguish the different forms of atheism.  . 

===Range===. 
Some of the ambiguity and controversy involved in defining ''atheism'' arises from difficulty in reaching a consensus for the definitions of words like ''deity'' and ''god''. The plurality of wildly different [[Conceptions of God|conceptions of god]] and deities leads to differing ideas regarding atheism's applicability. The ancient Romans accused Christians of being atheists for not worshiping the [[paganism|pagan]] deities. Gradually, this view fell into disfavor as ''theism'' came to be understood as encompassing belief in any divinity. <ref name="mmartin"/> . 

With respect to the range of phenomena being rejected, atheism may counter anything from the existence of a deity, to the existence of any [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[supernatural]], or [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] concepts, such as those of [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Taoism]]. <ref name="Britannica-Rejection-of-all-religious-beliefs">{{cite encyclopedia |author=Britannica |title=Atheism as rejection of religious beliefs |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/40634/atheism |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |edition=15th |volume=1 |page=666 |year=2011 |id=0852294735 |ref=harv | accessdate=2011-04-09}}

===Implicit vs. explicit===. 
{{Main|Implicit and explicit atheism}}
Definitions of atheism also vary in the degree of consideration a person must put to the idea of gods to be considered an atheist. Atheism has sometimes been defined to include the simple absence of belief that any deities exist. This broad definition would include newborns and other people who have not been exposed to theistic ideas. As far back as 1772, [[Baron d'Holbach]] said that "All children are born Atheists; they have no idea of God."<ref>{{cite book |last=d'Holbach |first=P. H. T. |authorlink=Baron d'Holbach |title=Good Sense |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7319 |year=1772 |accessdate=2011-04-07}}
</ref>
Similarly, [[George H. Smith]] (1979) suggested that: "The man who is unacquainted with theism is an atheist because he does not believe in a god. This category would also include the child with the conceptual capacity to grasp the issues involved, but who is still unaware of those issues. The fact that this child does not believe in god qualifies him as an atheist."<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1979|p=14}}. 
</ref>
Smith coined the term ''implicit atheism'' to refer to "the absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it" and ''explicit atheism'' to refer to the more common definition of conscious disbelief. 
[[Ernest Nagel]] contradicts Smith's definition of atheism as merely "absence of theism", acknowledging only explicit atheism as true "atheism". <ref>

have contrasted positive (strong/hard) atheism with negative (weak/soft) atheism. Positive atheism is the explicit affirmation that gods do not exist. Negative atheism includes all other forms of non-theism. According to this categorization, anyone who is not a theist is either a negative or a positive atheist. 
The terms ''weak'' and ''strong'' are relatively recent, while the terms ''negative'' and ''positive'' atheism are of older origin, having been used (in slightly different ways) in the philosophical literature<ref name="presumption"/> and in Catholic apologetics. <ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/jm3303.htm |title=On the Meaning of Contemporary Atheism |journal=The Review of Politics |first=Jacques |last=Maritain |year=1949 |month=July |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=267–280 |doi=10.1017/S0034670500044168 |ref=harv}}
</ref>
Under this demarcation of atheism, most agnostics qualify as negative atheists.  . 

While [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Martin]], for example, asserts that agnosticism entails negative atheism,<ref name="mmartin"/> most agnostics see their view as distinct from atheism, which they may consider no more justified than theism or requiring an equal conviction. <ref>{{cite book |first=Anthony |last=Kenny |authorlink=Anthony Kenny |title=What I believe |chapter=Why I Am Not an Atheist |publisher=Continuum |isbn=0-8264-8971-0 |quote=The true default position is neither theism nor atheism, but agnosticism ... a claim to knowledge needs to be substantiated; ignorance need only be confessed. |year=2006}}
</ref>
The assertion of unattainability of knowledge for or against the existence of gods is sometimes seen as indication that atheism requires a [[leap of faith]]. <ref>{{cite news |title=Many atheists I know would be certain of a high place in heaven |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0725/1224251303564.html |publisher=Irish Times| accessdate=2011-04-09 |date=2009-07-07}}

Common atheist responses to this argument include that unproven ''[[faith#Faith in world religions|religious]]'' propositions deserve as much disbelief as all ''other'' unproven propositions,<ref>{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|pp=30–34}}. "Who seriously claims we should say 'I neither believe nor disbelieve that the Pope is a robot', or 'As to whether or not eating this piece of chocolate will turn me into an elephant I am completely agnostic'. In the absence of any good reasons to believe these outlandish claims, we rightly disbelieve them, we don't just suspend judgement."
</ref>
and that the unprovability of a god's existence does not imply equal probability of either possibility. <ref>{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=22}}. "A lack of proof is no grounds for the suspension of belief. This is because when we have a lack of absolute proof we can still have overwhelming evidence or one explanation which is far superior to the alternatives."
</ref>
Scottish philosopher [[J. J. C. Smart]] even argues that "sometimes a person who is really an atheist may describe herself, even passionately, as an agnostic because of unreasonable generalised [[philosophical skepticism]] which would preclude us from saying that we know anything whatever, except perhaps the truths of mathematics and formal logic."<ref name="stanford">{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/ |title=Atheism and Agnosticism |first=J.C.C. |last=Smart |date=2004-03-09 |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | accessdate=2011-04-09}}

Consequently, some atheist authors such as [[Richard Dawkins]] prefer distinguishing theist, agnostic and atheist positions along a [[spectrum of theistic probability]]—the likelihood that each assigns to the statement "God exists". <ref>{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Dawkins|title=The God Delusion|year=2006|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co|isbn=0-618-68000-4|page=50}}

===Definition as impossible or impermanent===. 
Before the 18th century, the existence of God was so universally accepted in the western world that even the possibility of true atheism was questioned. This is called ''theistic [[innatism]]''—the notion that all people believe in God from birth; within this view was the connotation that atheists are simply in denial. <ref>{{cite book |last=Cudworth |first=Ralph |authorlink=Ralph Cudworth |title=The True Intellectual System of the Universe: the first part, wherein all the reason and philosophy of atheism is confuted and its impossibility demonstrated |year=1678}}

There is also a position claiming that atheists are quick to believe in God in times of crisis, that atheists make [[deathbed conversion]]s, or that "there are no [[atheists in foxholes]]."<ref>See, for instance, {{cite web|url=http://www.lds-mormon.com/atheist.shtml|title=Atheists call for church head to retract slur|date=1996-09-03| accessdate=2011-04-09}}

==Philosophical concepts==. 
[[Image:D'Holbach.jpg|thumb|[[Baron d'Holbach|Paul Henri Thiry, Baron d'Holbach]], an 18th century advocate of atheism. 
{{quote|The source of man's unhappiness is his ignorance of Nature.

]] . 

The broadest demarcation of atheistic rationale is between practical and theoretical atheism.  . 

===Practical atheism===. 
{{Main|Apatheism}}
In ''practical'' or ''[[pragmatism|pragmatic]]'' atheism, also known as ''[[apatheism]]'', individuals live as if there are no gods and explain natural phenomena without resorting to the divine. The existence of gods is not rejected, but may be designated unnecessary or useless; gods neither provide purpose to life, nor influence everyday life, according to this view. <ref name="Zdybicka-p20">{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=20}}. 
</ref>
A form of practical atheism with implications for the [[scientific community]] is [[methodological naturalism]]—the "tacit adoption or assumption of philosophical naturalism within [[scientific method]] with or without fully accepting or believing it."<ref name="neps">{{cite web |last=Schafersman |first=Steven D. |url=http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:NSuw6hjn_w0J:www.tcnj.edu/~scholars/111%2520Evolution%2520FSP/NATURALISM%2520IS%2520AN%2520ESSENTIAL%2520PART%2520OF%2520SCIENCE%2520AND%2520CRITICAL%2520INQUIRY.doc+Naturalism+is+an+Essential+Part+of+Science+and+Critical+Inquiry&hl=en&gl=ca&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESiOoQ0c8zeA-NUM5qRN7EZqXoJs8b3hGUyuOedNRD9OheY2WLJHpdgNCsxwDJ0iJVdxIhSyytGXR-RXodM3cV8JYd6mEmBRuSQhAsvgFyIDPrw2HT3KXZTEoujo4lXsMckPLn-U&sig=AHIEtbS7vrl9TTdgC7ZY94opxblINuXYMw&pli=1 |title=Naturalism is an Essential Part of Science and Critical Inquiry |date = February 1997|publisher=Conference on Naturalism, Theism and the Scientific Enterprise.

</ref> . 

Practical atheism can take various forms:
* Absence of religious motivation—belief in gods does not motivate moral action, religious action, or any other form of action;
* Active exclusion of the problem of gods and religion from intellectual pursuit and practical action;
* Indifference—the absence of any interest in the problems of gods and religion; or
* Unawareness of the concept of a deity. <ref>{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=21}}. 
</ref> . 

===Theoretical atheism===. 
====Ontological arguments====. 
{{See|Agnostic atheism|Theological noncognitivism}}
Theoretical (or theoric) atheism explicitly posits arguments against the existence of gods, responding to common [[Arguments for the existence of God|theistic arguments]] such as the [[argument from design]] or [[Pascal's Wager]]. Theoretical atheism is mainly an ontology, precisely a [[physical ontology]].  . 

====Epistemological arguments====. 
{{See|Agnostic atheism|Theological noncognitivism}}
[[Epistemology|Epistemological]] atheism argues that people cannot know a God or determine the existence of a God. The foundation of epistemological atheism is agnosticism, which takes a variety of forms. In the philosophy of [[immanence]], divinity is inseparable from the world itself, including a person's mind, and each person's [[consciousness]] is locked in the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]. According to this form of agnosticism, this limitation in perspective prevents any objective inference from belief in a god to assertions of its existence. The [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] agnosticism of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] only accepts knowledge deduced with human rationality; this form of atheism holds that gods are not discernible as a matter of principle, and therefore cannot be known to exist. [[Skepticism]], based on the ideas of [[David Hume|Hume]], asserts that certainty about anything is impossible, so one can never know the existence of a God. The allocation of agnosticism to atheism is disputed; it can also be regarded as an independent, basic worldview. <ref name="Zdybicka-p20"/> . 

Other arguments for atheism that can be classified as epistemological or [[ontology|ontological]], including [[logical positivism]] and [[ignosticism]], assert the meaninglessness or unintelligibility of basic terms such as "God" and statements such as "God is all-powerful." [[Theological noncognitivism]] holds that the statement "God exists" does not express a proposition, but is nonsensical or cognitively meaningless. It has been argued both ways as to whether such individuals can be classified into some form of atheism or agnosticism. Philosophers [[Alfred Ayer|A. J. Ayer]] and [[Theodore M. Drange]] reject both categories, stating that both camps accept "God exists" as a proposition; they instead place noncognitivism in its own category. <ref>[[Theodore Drange|Drange, Theodore M.]] (1998).

</ref> . 

====Metaphysical arguments====. 
{{See|Monism|Physicalism}}
One author writes:
{{quote|"Metaphysical atheism... includes all doctrines that hold to metaphysical monism (the homogeneity of reality). Metaphysical atheism may be either: a) absolute — an explicit denial of God's existence associated with materialistic monism (all materialistic trends, both in ancient and modern times); b) relative — the implicit denial of God in all philosophies that, while they accept the existence of an absolute, conceive of the absolute as not possessing any of the attributes proper to God: transcendence, a personal character or unity. Relative atheism is associated with idealistic monism (pantheism, panentheism, deism)."<ref>{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=19}}. </ref>}} . 

[[File:Epikouros BM 1843.jpg|thumb|left|[[Epicurus]] is credited with first expounding the [[problem of evil]]. [[David Hume]] in his ''[[Dialogues concerning Natural Religion]]'' (1779) cited Epicurus in stating the argument as a series of questions:<ref>{{cite book |title=Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion |author=David Hume |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4583 |publisher=Project Gutenberg (e-text) |accessdate=2011-04-08}}

"Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is impotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?"]] . 

====Logical arguments====. 
{{Further2|[[Existence of God#Deductive arguments|Deductive arguments against the existence of God]], [[Problem of evil]], [[Argument from nonbelief|Divine hiddenness]]}}
Logical atheism holds that the various [[conceptions of God|conceptions of gods]], such as the [[personal god]] of Christianity, are ascribed logically inconsistent qualities. Such atheists present [[existence of God#Deductive arguments|deductive arguments]] against the existence of God, which assert the incompatibility between certain traits, such as perfection, creator-status, [[immutability (theology)|immutability]], [[omniscience]], [[omnipresence]], [[omnipotence]], [[omnibenevolence]], [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]], personhood (a personal being), nonphysicality, [[justice]], and [[mercy]]. <ref>Various authors. "Logical Arguments for Atheism". [[Internet Infidels]], ''The Secular Web Library''. Retrieved 2007-APR-09. 
</ref> . 

[[Theodicy|Theodicean]] atheists believe that the world as they experience it cannot be reconciled with the qualities commonly ascribed to God and gods by theologians. They argue that an [[omniscience|omniscient]], [[omnipotence|omnipotent]], and [[omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] God is not compatible with a world where there is [[problem of evil|evil]] and [[suffering]], and where divine love is [[Divine hiddenness|hidden]] from many people. <ref>[[Theodore Drange|Drange, Theodore M.]] (1996).

A similar argument is attributed to [[Siddhartha Gautama]], the founder of [[Buddhism]]. <ref>V.A. Gunasekara, {{cite web |url=http://www.buddhistinformation.com/buddhist_attitude_to_god.htm |title=The Buddhist Attitude to God. |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080102053643/http://www.buddhistinformation.com/buddhist_attitude_to_god.htm |archivedate=2008-01-02}} In the Bhuridatta Jataka, "The Buddha argues that the three most commonly given attributes of God, viz. omnipotence, omniscience and benevolence towards humanity cannot all be mutually compatible with the existential fact of dukkha."

===Reductionary accounts of religion===. 
{{See|Evolutionary origin of religions|Evolutionary psychology of religion|Psychology of religion}}
Philosophers such as [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]]<ref>Feuerbach, Ludwig (1841) ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]''</ref>
and [[Sigmund Freud]] argued that God and other religious beliefs are human inventions, created to fulfill various psychological and emotional wants or needs. This is also a view of many [[Buddhism|Buddhists]]. <ref>Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught.'' Grove Press, 1974. Pages 51–52. </ref>
[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], influenced by the work of Feuerbach, argued that belief in God and religion are social functions, used by those in power to oppress the working class. According to [[Mikhail Bakunin]], "the idea of God implies the abdication of human reason and justice; it is the most decisive negation of human liberty, and necessarily ends in the enslavement of mankind, in theory and practice." He reversed [[Voltaire]]'s famous aphorism that if God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him, writing instead that "if God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish him."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bakunin/godandstate/godandstate_ch1.html |title=God and the State |last=Bakunin |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Bakunin |year=1916 |work= |publisher=New York: Mother Earth Publishing Association | accessdate=2011-04-09}}
</ref> . 

===Alternatives===. 
{{See|Philosophical anthropology|Humanism}}
[[Axiological]], or constructive, atheism rejects the existence of gods in favor of a "higher absolute", such as [[Human nature|humanity]]. <!-- The previous wikilink is a disambig. page. Someone redirect it to human race, human nature, etc., etc. --> This form of atheism favors humanity as the absolute source of ethics and values, and permits individuals to resolve moral problems without resorting to God. Marx and Freud used this argument to convey messages of liberation, full-development, and unfettered happiness. <ref name="Zdybicka-p20"/> . 

One of the most common [[criticism of atheism|criticisms of atheism]] has been to the contrary—that denying the existence of a god leads to [[moral relativism]], leaving one with no moral or ethical foundation,<ref name="misconceptions">{{cite web |url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/12346 |title=Common Misconceptions About Atheists and Atheism |last=Gleeson |first=David |date=August 10, 2006 |publisher=''American Chronicle'' |accessdate=2011-04-07}}

The thoroughly materialistic and anti-theistic philosophical [[Cārvāka]] (also called ''Nastika'' or ''Lokaiata'') school that originated in [[India]] around the 6th century BCE is probably the most explicitly atheistic school of philosophy in India, similar to the Greek [[Cyrenaic school]]. This branch of Indian philosophy is classified as [[nastika|heterodox]] due to its rejection of the authority of [[Vedas]] and hence is not considered part of the six orthodox schools of Hinduism, but it is noteworthy as evidence of a materialistic movement within Hinduism. <ref>Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles A.

Chatterjee and Datta explain that our understanding of Cārvāka philosophy is fragmentary, based largely on criticism of the ideas by other schools, and that it is not a living tradition: . 

<blockquote>
"Though [[materialism]] in some form or other has always been present in India, and occasional references are found in the Vedas, the Buddhistic literature, the Epics, as well as in the later philosophical works we do not find any systematic work on materialism, nor any organized school of followers as the other philosophical schools possess. But almost every work of the other schools states, for refutation, the materialistic views. Our knowledge of Indian materialism is chiefly based on these."<ref>Satischandra Chatterjee and Dhirendramohan Datta. ''An Introduction to Indian Philosophy''. Eighth Reprint Edition.

[[Euhemerus]] (c. 330–260 BCE) published his view that the gods were only the deified rulers, conquerors and founders of the past, and that their cults and religions were in essence the continuation of vanished kingdoms and earlier political structures. <ref>Fragments of Euhemerus' work in Ennius' Latin translation have been preserved in [[Church Fathers|Patristic]] writings (e.g. by [[Lactantius]] and [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]), which all rely on earlier fragments in [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] 5,41–46 & 6.1. Testimonies, especially in the context of polemical criticism, are found e.g. in [[Callimachus]], ''Hymn to Zeus'' 8.

Atomic materialist [[Epicurus]] (c. 341–270 BCE) disputed many religious doctrines, including the existence of an [[afterlife]] or a [[personal god|personal deity]]; he considered the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] purely material and mortal.

The Roman poet [[Lucretius]] (c. 99–55 BCE) agreed that, if there were gods, they were unconcerned with humanity and unable to affect the natural world. For this reason, he believed humanity should have no fear of the supernatural. He expounds his Epicurean views of the cosmos, atoms, the soul, mortality, and religion in ''[[De rerum natura]]'' ("On the nature of things"),<ref>{{Gutenberg|no=785|name=On the Nature of Things by Lucretius}} Book I, "Substance is Eternal".

[[Sallust]], ''The War With Catiline'', Caesar's speech: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Sallust/Bellum_Catilinae*.html#51.20 51.29] & Cato's reply: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Sallust/Bellum_Catilinae*.html#52.13 52.13]).

The Roman philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]] held that one should suspend judgment about virtually all beliefs—a form of skepticism known as [[Pyrrhonism]]—that nothing was inherently evil, and that [[ataraxia]] ("peace of mind") is attainable by withholding one's judgment. His relatively large volume of surviving works had a lasting influence on later philosophers. <ref name="gordonstein">Stein, Gordon (Ed.) (1980).

The meaning of "atheist" changed over the course of classical antiquity. The early Christians were labeled atheists by non-Christians because of their disbelief in pagan gods. <ref name="cathencyc-atheism">{{ws|"[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Atheism|Atheism]]" in the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia}}

During the [[Roman Empire]], Christians were executed for their rejection of the [[List of Roman deities|Roman gods]] in general and Emperor-worship in particular. When Christianity became the state religion of Rome under [[Theodosius I]] in 381, [[Christian heresy|heresy]] became a punishable offense. <ref>Maycock, A. L. and Ronald Knox (2003).

===Early Middle Ages to the Renaissance===. 
The espousal of atheistic views was rare in Europe during the [[Early Middle Ages]] and [[Middle Ages]] (see [[Medieval Inquisition]]); [[metaphysics]], religion and theology were the dominant interests. <ref name="Zdybicka 2005 4">{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=4}}
</ref>
There were, however, movements within this period that forwarded heterodox conceptions of the Christian God, including differing views of the nature, transcendence, and knowability of God. Individuals and groups such as [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]], [[David of Dinant]], [[Amalric of Bena]], and the [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]] maintained Christian viewpoints with [[pantheism|pantheistic]] tendencies. [[Nicholas of Cusa]] held to a form of [[fideism]] he called ''[[De Docta Ignorantia|docta ignorantia]]'' ("learned ignorance"), asserting that God is beyond human categorization, and our knowledge of God is limited to conjecture. [[William of Ockham]] inspired anti-metaphysical tendencies with his [[nominalism|nominalistic]] limitation of human knowledge to singular objects, and asserted that the divine [[essence]] could not be intuitively or rationally apprehended by human intellect. Followers of Ockham, such as [[John of Mirecourt]] and [[Nicholas of Autrecourt]] furthered this view. The resulting division between faith and reason influenced later theologians such as [[John Wycliffe]], [[Jan Hus]], and [[Martin Luther]]. <ref name="Zdybicka 2005 4"/> . 

The [[Renaissance]] did much to expand the scope of freethought and skeptical inquiry. Individuals such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] sought experimentation as a means of explanation, and opposed [[Appeal to authority|arguments from religious authority]]. Other critics of religion and the Church during this time included [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Bonaventure des Périers]], and [[François Rabelais]]. <ref name="gordonstein"/> . 

===Early modern period===. 
The [[Renaissance]] and [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] eras witnessed a resurgence in religious fervor, as evidenced by the proliferation of new religious orders, confraternities, and popular devotions in the Catholic world, and the appearance of increasingly austere Protestant sects such as the [[Calvinists]]. This era of interconfessional rivalry permitted an even wider scope of theological and philosophical speculation, much of which would later be used to advance a religiously skeptical world-view.  . 

[[Criticism of Christianity]] became increasingly frequent in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and England, where there appears to have been a religious [[malaise]], according to contemporary sources. Some Protestant thinkers, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], espoused a materialist philosophy and skepticism toward supernatural occurrences, while the Jewish-Dutch philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] rejected [[divine providence]] in favour of a [[panentheistic]] naturalism. By the late 17th century, [[deism]] came to be openly espoused by intellectuals such as [[John Toland (Irish Philosopher)|John Toland]] who coined the term "pantheist". Despite their ridicule of Christianity, many deists held atheism in scorn.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The first known explicit atheist was the German critic of religion [[Matthias Knutzen]] in his three writings of 1674. <ref>Winfried Schröder, in: Matthias Knutzen: Schriften und Materialien (2010), p. 8. See also Rececca Moore, ''The Heritage of Western Humanism, Scepticism and Freethought'' (2011), calling Knutzen "the first open advocate of a modern atheist perspective" [http://reason.sdsu.edu/germany.html online here]</ref> He was followed a half century later by another explicit atheist writer, the French priest [[Jean Meslier]]. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://nova.wpunj.edu/newpolitics/issue40/Onfray40.htm |title=Michel Onfray on Jean Meslier |publisher=William Paterson University |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref> . 

Knutzen and Meslier were in turn followed by other openly atheistic thinkers, such as [[Baron d'Holbach]] and [[Jacques-André Naigeon]]. <ref name=Holbach-SoN>{{cite book |last=d'Holbach |first=P. H. T. |authorlink=Baron d'Holbach |title=The System of Nature |url=http://fulltextarchive.com/page/The-System-of-Nature-Vol-21/ |accessdate=2011-04-07 |year=1770 |volume=2}}

The philosopher [[David Hume]] developed a skeptical epistemology grounded in empiricism, undermining the metaphysical basis of natural theology. 
[[Image:Feuerbach Ludwig.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]]'s ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841) would greatly influence philosophers such as [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[David Strauss]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], and [[Max Stirner]]. He considered God to be a human invention and religious activities to be wish-fulfillment. For this he is considered the founding father of modern [[anthropology of religion]].]]
The [[French Revolution]] took atheism and [[anticlericalism|anti-clerical]] deism outside the salons and into the public sphere. A major goal of the French revolution was a restructuring and subordination of the clergy with respect to the state through the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]]. Attempts to enforce it led to anti-clerical violence and the expulsion of many clergy from France. The chaotic political events in revolutionary Paris eventually enabled the more radical [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]] to seize power in 1793, ushering in the [[Reign of Terror]]. The Jacobins were deists and introduced the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]] as a new French state religion. Some atheists surrounding [[Jacques Hébert]] instead sought to establish a [[Cult of Reason]], a form of atheistic pseudo-religion with a goddess personifying reason. Both movements in part contributed to attempts to forcibly de-Christianize France. The [[Cult of Reason]] ended after three years when its leadership, including [[Jacques Hébert]] was guillotined by the Jacobins. The anti-clerical persecutions ended with the [[Thermidorian Reaction]].  . 

The [[Napoleonic era]] institutionalized the secularization of French society, and exported the revolution to northern Italy, in the hopes of creating pliable republics. In the 19th century, atheists contributed to political and social revolution, facilitating the [[Revolutions of 1848|upheavals of 1848]], the [[Italian unification|Risorgimento]] in Italy, and the growth of an international [[socialism|socialist]] movement.  . 

In the latter half of the 19th century, atheism rose to prominence under the influence of [[rationalism|rationalistic]] and [[freethought|freethinking]] philosophers. Many prominent German philosophers of this era denied the existence of deities and were critical of religion, including [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Max Stirner]], [[Karl Marx]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. <ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=BKz2FcDrFy0C&pg=PA1&dq=nietzsche+schopenhauer+marx+feuerbach |title=Subjectivity and Irreligion: Atheism and Agnosticism in Kant, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |last=Ray |first=Matthew Alun |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7546-3456-0 | accessdate=2011-04-09}}

===Since 1900===. 
{{See also|State atheism}}
Atheism in the 20th century, particularly in the form of practical atheism, advanced in many societies. Atheistic thought found recognition in a wide variety of other, broader philosophies, such as [[existentialism]], [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|objectivism]], [[secular humanism]], [[nihilism]], [[anarchism]], [[logical positivism]], [[Marxism]], [[feminism]],<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=tAeFipOVx4MC&pg=PA233&lpg=PA233&dq=%22Feminism+and+Atheism%22&q=%22Feminism%20and%20Atheism%22 |last=Overall |first=Christine |title=Feminism and Atheism |isbn=978-0-521-84270-9 |year=2007 |accessdate=2011-04-09}} in {{harvnb|Martin|2007|pp=233–246}}

and the general scientific and [[rationalist movement]].  . 

Logical positivism and [[scientism]] paved the way for [[neopositivism]], [[analytical philosophy]], [[structuralism]], and [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]. Neopositivism and analytical philosophy discarded classical rationalism and metaphysics in favor of strict empiricism and epistemological [[nominalism]]. Proponents such as [[Bertrand Russell]] emphatically rejected belief in God. In his early work, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] attempted to separate metaphysical and supernatural language from rational discourse. [[A. J. Ayer]] asserted the unverifiability and meaninglessness of religious statements, citing his adherence to the empirical sciences. Relatedly the applied [[structuralism]] of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]] sourced religious language to the human subconscious in denying its transcendental meaning. [[John Niemeyer Findlay|J. N. Findlay]] and [[J. J. C. Smart]] argued that the existence of God is not logically necessary. Naturalists and materialistic monists such as [[John Dewey]] considered the natural world to be the basis of everything, denying the existence of God or immortality. <ref name="stanford"/><ref>{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=16}}
</ref> . 

The 20th century also saw the political advancement of atheism, spurred on by interpretation of the works of [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]. After the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] of 1917, religious instruction was banned by the State. While the Soviet Constitution of 1936 guaranteed freedom to hold religious services, the [[Soviet state]] under Stalin's policy of [[Religion in the Soviet Union|state atheism]] did not consider education a private matter; it outlawed [[Religious education|religious instruction]] and waged campaigns to persuade people, at times violently, to abandon religion. <ref name="Liquidation">{{cite book|author=Gerhard Simon|url=http://books.google.com/?id=sTLc8H3b4vUC&pg=PA64|title=Church, State, and Opposition in the U.S.S.R.|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|quote=On the other hand the Communist Party has never made any secret of the fact, either before or after 1917, that it regards 'militant atheism' as an integral part of its ideology and will regard 'religion as by no means a private matter'.

New Atheism is the name given to a movement among some early-21st-century atheist writers who have advocated the view that "religion should not simply be tolerated but should be countered, criticized, and exposed by rational argument wherever its influence arises."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/11/08/atheism.feature/index.html|title=The rise of the New Atheists|publisher=[[CNN]]|first=Simon|last=Hooper|accessdate=2010-03-16}}

The movement is commonly associated with [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Daniel C. Dennett]], [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], [[Christopher Hitchens]], and [[Victor J. Stenger]]. Several best-selling books by these authors, published between 2004 and 2007, form the basis for much of the discussion of New Atheism. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/battle.html|title=The New Atheism|publisher=[[Colorado University]]|first=Victor J|last=Stenger|accessdate=2009-07-23}}</ref> .

An inverse [[correlation]] between [[religiosity and intelligence]] has been found by 39 studies carried out between 1927 and 2002, according to an article in ''[[Mensa International|Mensa]] Magazine''. <ref>According to Dawkins (2006), p. 103.

The strictest sense of positive atheism does not entail any specific beliefs outside of disbelief in any deity; as such, atheists can hold any number of spiritual beliefs. For the same reason, atheists can hold a wide variety of ethical beliefs, ranging from the [[moral universalism]] of [[humanism]], which holds that a moral code should be applied consistently to all humans, to [[moral nihilism]], which holds that morality is meaningless. <ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1979|pp=21–22}}
</ref> . 

===Divine command vs. ethics===. 
Although it is a philosophical truism, encapsulated in Plato's [[Euthyphro dilemma]], that the role of the gods in determining right from wrong is either unnecessary or arbitrary, [[Divine command theory|the argument that morality must be derived from God]] and cannot exist without a wise creator has been a persistent feature of political if not so much philosophical debate. <ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1979|p=275}}. "Among the many myths associated with religion, none is more widespread -or more disastrous in its effects—than the myth that moral values cannot be divorced from the belief in a god."
</ref><ref>
In [[Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' (Book Eleven: ''Brother Ivan Fyodorovich'', Chapter 4) there is the famous argument that ''If there is no God, all things are permitted.'': "'But what will become of men then?' I asked him, 'without God and immortal life? All things are lawful then, they can do what they like?'"
</ref><ref name="Kant CPR A811">
For [[Kant]], the presupposition of God, soul, and freedom was a practical concern, for "Morality, by itself, constitutes a system, but happiness does not, unless it is distributed in exact proportion to morality. This, however, is possible in an intelligible world only under a wise author and ruler. Reason compels us to admit such a ruler, together with life in such a world, which we must consider as future life, or else all moral laws are to be considered as idle dreams..." (''Critique of Pure Reason'', A811). 
</ref>
Moral precepts such as "murder is wrong" are seen as [[divine law]]s, requiring a divine lawmaker and judge. However, many atheists argue that treating morality legalistically involves a [[false analogy]], and that morality does not depend on a lawmaker in the same way that laws do. <ref>{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=38}}

Other atheists, such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], have disagreed with this view and have stated that morality "has truth only if God is truth—it stands or falls with faith in God."<ref name="Fortin & Benestad">{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/?id=19ccmx1W58IC&pg=PA16&dq=has+truth+only+if+God+is+truth%E2%80%93it+stands+or+falls+with+faith+in+God#v=onepage&q=has%20truth%20only%20if%20God%20is%20truth%E2%80%93it%20stands%20or%20falls%20with%20faith%20in%20God&f=false|title =Human Rights, Virtue, and the Common Good|publisher = [[Rowman & Littlefield]]|quote=That problem was brought home to us with dazzling clarity by Nietzsche, who had reflected more deeply than any of his contemporaries on the implications of godlessness and come to the conclusion that a fatal contradiction lay at the heart of modern theological enterprise: it thought that Christian morality, which it wished to preserve, was independent of Christian dogma, which it rejected. This, in Nietzsche's mind, was an absurdity.

(among others) assert that behaving ethically only because of divine mandate is not true ethical behavior but merely blind obedience. Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves—to be able to discern, for example, that "thou shalt steal" is immoral even if one's religion instructs it—and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations. <ref>{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=43}}

The contemporary British political philosopher Martin Cohen has offered the more historically telling example of Biblical injunctions in favour of torture and slavery as evidence of how religious injunctions follow political and social customs, rather than vice versa, but also noted that the same tendency seems to be true of supposedly dispassionate and objective philosophers. <ref>101 Ethical Dilemmas, 2nd edition, by Cohen, M., Routledge 2007, pp184-5. (Cohen notes particularly that Plato and Aristotle produced arguments in favour of slavery.)
</ref> Cohen extends this argument in more detail in ''Political Philosophy from Plato to Mao'', where he argues that the [[Qur'an]] played a role in perpetuating social codes from the early 7th century despite changes in secular society. <ref>Political Philosophy from Plato to Mao, by Cohen, M, Second edition 2008

Atheists have often engaged in debate with religious advocates, and the debates sometimes address the issue of whether religions provide a net benefit to individuals and society.  . 

One argument that religions can be harmful, made by atheists such as Sam Harris, is that Western religions' reliance on divine authority lends itself to [[authoritarianism]] and [[dogma]]tism. <ref>{{cite web |last=Harris |first=Sam |authorlink=Sam Harris (author) |title=The Myth of Secular Moral Chaos |url=http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=library&page=sharris_26_3 |publisher=[[Free Inquiry]] |year=2006a | accessdate=2011-04-09}}

People frequently adopt an attitude of rejection toward a position for reasons other than that it is a false proposition. It is common among contemporary philosophers, and indeed it was not uncommon in earlier centuries, to reject positions on the ground that they are meaningless. Sometimes, too, a theory is rejected on such grounds as that it is sterile or redundant or capricious, and there are many other considerations which in certain contexts are generally agreed to constitute good grounds for rejecting an assertion. |ref=harv}}(page 175 in 1967 edition)

|quote=As commonly understood, atheism is the position that affirms the nonexistence of God. So an atheist is someone who disbelieves in God, whereas a theist is someone who believes in God. Another meaning of "atheism" is simply nonbelief in the existence of God, rather than positive belief in the nonexistence of God. ...an atheist, in the broader sense of the term, is someone who disbelieves in every form of deity, not just the God of traditional Western theology.

[u.a.]|isbn=9780313351839 | quote = A major source of these biases is the lack of clear definitions. Atheism and secularity are defined in opposition to religion, with atheism (the rejection of theism) often perceived as an extreme form of secularism (the decline of religious influence over society). But atheism is a narrow term referring to a specific belief (that there is no god), whereas secularism has various meanings, including a range of attitudes (such as religious indifference, doubt, agnosticism, and atheism) as as behaviors (such as lack of regular church attendance or disregard for traditional religious morality). }}

[[Religioustolerance.org]]'s short article on [http://www.religioustolerance.org/atheist4.htm Definitions of the term "Atheism"] suggests that there is no consensus on the definition of the term.
