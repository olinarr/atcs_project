The '''argument from inconsistent revelations''', also known as the '''avoiding the wrong hell problem''', is an [[arguments against the existence of God|argument against the existence of God]]. It asserts that it is unlikely that [[God]] exists because many [[theology|theologians]] and [[faith]]ful adherents have produced conflicting and mutually exclusive [[revelation]]s. The argument states that since a person not privy to revelation must either accept it or reject it based solely upon the authority of its proponent, and there is no way for a mere mortal to resolve these conflicting claims by investigation, it is prudent to [[Weak agnosticism|reserve one's judgment]].  . 

It is also argued that it is difficult to accept the existence of any one God without personal revelation. Most [[arguments for the existence of God]] are not specific to any one religion and could be applied to many religions with near equal validity. Acceptance of any one religion thus requires a rejection of the others, and when faced with these competing claims in the absence of a personal revelation, it is argued that it is difficult to decide amongst them. Were a personal revelation to be granted to a nonbeliever, the same problem of confusion would develop in each new person the believer shares the revelation with.  . 

==Particular examples==. 
[[Christianity|Christians]] believe that [[Jesus]] is the savior of the world and the [[Messiah|son of God]]; [[Jew]]s and [[Islam|Muslims]] do not. Similarly, Muslims believe that the [[Qur'an]] was divinely authored, while Jews and Christians do not. There are many examples of such contrasting views, indeed, opposing fundamental beliefs ([[Schism (religion)|schisms]]) exist even within each [[Major religious groups|major religion]]. Christianity, for example, has many subsets ([[Christian denominations|denominations]]), not all of which are mutually compatible. [[Hinduism]], with its conception of multiple deities being expressions of one [[Supreme God]], is more open to the possibility that other religions might be 'correct' for their followers, but this same principle requires the rejection of the exclusivity demanded by each of the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic faiths]].  . 

Additionally, Faith-confirming events such as visions and miracles are reported within all faiths with regularity. A single deity associated with a single exclusive existing faith or sect would either have to have caused adherents to other faiths to have visionary or miraculous experiences which lead them to continue to reject the 'true' faith, or at least allowed some other agency to cause these same effects.  . 

The problem does not arise in some theological models. In [[Deism]], it is believed that there is a God, but presumed that there are no divinely caused revelations or miracles at all, leaving reports of such to have natural explanations. In some forms of [[Pantheism]] (where God is the [[Universe]]) and in [[Pandeism]] (where God has become the Universe), the appearance of many inconsistent divine revelations or miracles might simply result unintentionally from the divine nature of the Universe itself.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} . 

==Mathematical description== . 

If it were to be assumed that: . 

* The existence of ''some'' god is certain,
* There is some number (''n'') of distinct, mutually exclusive interpretations of that god one could believe in,
* There is no way to tell which one, if any, were true ''[[Prior_probability|a priori]]'' . 

then the [[Equiprobable|probability]] of having chosen to practice the correct [[religion]] (through upbringing or by making [[Pascal's Wager]]) is {{frac|1|''n''}}.  Therefore, if there exist more than two distinct faiths, the probability that a person who chooses to believe in either faith has chosen the correct one would be less than 1 in 2 (50% or {{frac|1|2}}).  . 

Since there are hundreds of religions in existence, some having thousands of sects with competing interpretations, the probability that a given person's religion should happen to be the one that is true (to the exclusion of all others) is diminishingly small.  . 

==Appearances== . 

The [[argument]] appears, among other places, in [[Voltaire|Voltaire's]] ''[[Candide]]'' and ''[[Philosophical Dictionary]]''. It is also manifested in [[Denis Diderot|Denis Diderot's]] statement that, whatever proofs are offered for the existence of God in Christianity or any other religion, "an [[Imam]] can reason the same way". <ref name="Diderot">{{cite book
