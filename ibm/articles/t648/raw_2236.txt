In ''The God Delusion'', Dawkins contends that a [[God|supernatural creator]] almost certainly does not exist and that belief in a [[personal god]] qualifies as a [[delusion]], which he defines as a persistent false belief held in the face of strong contradictory [[evidence]]. He is sympathetic to [[Robert Pirsig]]'s statement in ''[[Lila: An Inquiry into Morals|Lila]]'' that "when one person suffers from a delusion it is called insanity. When many people suffer from a delusion it is called religion."<ref name="preface">{{cite book |author=Dawkins, Richard |title=''The God Delusion'' |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=2006 |isbn=0-618-68000-4 |oclc= | authorlink = Richard Dawkins |page=406}}; {{PDF|[http://www.randomhouse.com.au/Downloads/News/GodDelusion_extract_revised.pdf on-line]|101&nbsp;KB}}</ref> .

The book has attracted widespread commentary, with many books written in response.  . 

==Background==. 
Dawkins has argued against [[Creationism|creationist]] explanations of life in his previous works on [[evolution]]. The theme of ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', published in 1986, is that evolution can explain the apparent design in nature. In ''The God Delusion'' he focuses directly on a wider range of arguments used for and against belief in the existence of a god (or gods).  . 

Dawkins identifies himself not as an atheist, but as technically agnostic, though "only to the extent that I am agnostic about fairies at the bottom of the garden".  . 

Dawkins had long wanted to write a book openly [[criticism of religion|criticising religion]], but his publisher had advised against it. By the year 2006, his publisher had warmed to the idea. Dawkins attributes this change of mind to "four years of [[George W. Bush|Bush]]". <ref>{{cite web |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=Richard Dawkins explains his latest book |work=RichardDawkins.net |url=http://richarddawkins.net/mainPage.php?bodyPage=article_body.php&id=170 |accessdate=14 September 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071013220047/http://richarddawkins.net/mainPage.php?bodyPage=article_body.php&id=170 |archivedate = 13 October 2007}}</ref>
By that time, a number of authors, including [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] and [[Christopher Hitchens]], who together with Dawkins were labelled "The Unholy Trinity" by Robert Weitzel, had already written books openly attacking religion. <ref>{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Weitzel |title=Hitchens, Dawkins, Harris: The Unholy Trinity... Thank God |work=Atlantic Free Press |url=http://www.atlanticfreepress.com/content/view/2112/1/ |accessdate=14 September 2007}}</ref> According to the [[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.uk]] website, the book led to a 50% growth in their sales of books on religion and spirituality (including anti-religious books such as ''The God Delusion'' and Hitchens's ''[[God Is Not Great|God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything]]'') and a 120% increase in the sales of the Bible. <ref>{{cite news |first=David |last=Smith |title=Believe it or not: the sceptics beat God in bestseller battle |work=The Observer |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,2147152,00.html |accessdate=5 October 2007 | location=London | date=12 August 2007}}</ref> . 

==Synopsis==. 
Dawkins dedicates the book to [[Douglas Adams]] and quotes the novelist: "Isn't it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too?" The book contains ten chapters. The first few chapters make a case that there is almost certainly no God, while the rest discuss religion and morality.  . 

Dawkins writes that ''The God Delusion'' contains four "consciousness-raising" messages:
# [[Atheism|Atheists]] can be happy, balanced, moral, and intellectually fulfilled. 
# [[Natural selection]] and similar scientific theories are superior to a "God hypothesis"—the illusion of [[intelligent design]]—in explaining the living world and the cosmos. 
# Children should not be labelled by their parents' religion. Terms like "Catholic child" or "Muslim child" should make people cringe. 
# Atheists should be proud, not apologetic, because atheism is evidence of a healthy, independent mind. <ref name="preface"/> . 

===The God hypothesis===. 
Since there are a number of different theistic ideas relating to the nature of God(s), Dawkins defines the concept of God that he wishes to address early in the book. Dawkins distinguishes between an abstract, impersonal god (such as found in [[pantheism]], or as promoted by [[Spinoza]] or [[Einstein]]<ref>{{cite news |first=James |last=Randerson |title=Childish superstition: Einstein's letter makes view of religion relatively clear |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/may/12/peopleinscience.religion/print |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=13 May 2008 |accessdate=14 May 2008 |quote=In the letter, he states: "The word god is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honourable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change this." }}</ref>) from a personal God who is the [[Creator deity|creator]] of the universe, who is interested in human affairs, and who should be [[worship]]ped. <ref>''The God Delusion'', page 13</ref>  This latter type of God, the existence of which Dawkins calls the "God Hypothesis", becomes an important theme in the book. <ref>''The God Delusion'', page 31</ref> He maintains that the existence of such a God would have effects in the physical universe and – like any other hypothesis – can be tested and falsified. <ref>''The God Delusion'', page 50. </ref> . 

Dawkins surveys briefly the main philosophical arguments in favour of [[Existence of God|God's existence]]. Of the various philosophical proofs that he discusses, he singles out the [[Teleological argument|Argument from design]] for longer consideration. Dawkins concludes that [[Natural selection#Evolution by means of natural selection|evolution by natural selection]] can explain apparent design in nature. <ref name=preface /> . 

He writes that one of the greatest challenges to the human intellect has been to explain "how the complex, improbable design in the universe arises", and suggests that there are two competing explanations:
# A hypothesis involving a designer, that is, a complex being to account for the complexity that we see. 
# A hypothesis, with supporting theories, that explains how, from simple origins and principles, something more complex can emerge. 
This is the basic set-up of his argument against the existence of God, the [[Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit]],<ref>''The God Delusion'', page 114</ref> where he argues that the first attempt is self-refuting, and the second approach is the way forward. <ref>This interpretation of the argument is based on the reviews by [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[PZ Myers]]. </ref> . 

At the end of chapter 4, ''Why there almost certainly is no God'', Dawkins sums up his argument and states, "The temptation [to attribute the appearance of a design to actual design itself] is a false one, because the designer hypothesis immediately raises the larger problem of who designed the designer. The whole problem we started out with was the problem of explaining statistical improbability. It is obviously no solution to postulate something even more improbable."<ref>''The God Delusion'', page 158</ref> In addition, chapter 4 asserts that the alternative to the designer hypothesis is not ''[[probability|chance]]'', but ''[[natural selection]]''.  . 

Dawkins does not claim to disprove God with absolute certainty. Instead, he suggests as a general principle that simpler explanations are preferable (see [[Occam's razor]]), and that an [[omniscient]] and [[omnipotent]] God must be extremely complex. As such he argues that the theory of a universe without a God is preferable to the theory of a universe with a God. <ref>''The God Delusion'', page 147-150</ref> . 

===Religion and morality===. 
The second half of the book begins by exploring the roots of religion and seeking an explanation for its ubiquity across human cultures. Dawkins advocates the "theory of religion as an accidental by-product – a misfiring of something useful"<ref>"The general theory of religion as an accidental by-product – a misfiring of something useful – is the one I wish to advocate" ''The God Delusion'', p. 188</ref> as for example the mind's employment of [[intentional stance]]. Dawkins suggests that the theory of [[memes]], and human susceptibility to religious memes in particular, can explain how religions might spread like "mind viruses" across societies. <ref>"the purpose of this section is to ''ask'' whether meme theory might work for the special case of religion" (italics in original, referring to one of the five sections of Chapter 5), ''The God Delusion'', p. 191</ref> . 

He then turns to the subject of [[morality]], maintaining that we do not need religion to be good. Instead, our morality has a [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] explanation: altruistic genes, selected through the process of evolution, give people natural empathy. He asks, "would you commit murder, rape or robbery if you knew that no God existed?" He argues that very few people would answer "yes", undermining the claim that religion is needed to make us behave morally. In support of this view, he surveys the history of morality, arguing that there is a moral [[Zeitgeist]] that continually evolves in society, generally progressing toward liberalism. As it progresses, this moral consensus influences how religious leaders interpret their holy writings. Thus, Dawkins states, morality does not originate from the Bible, rather our moral progress informs what part of the Bible Christians accept and what they now dismiss. <ref>Having given some examples of what he considers to be the brutish morality of the Old Testament, Dawkins writes, "Of course, irritated theologians will protest that we don't take the book of Genesis literally any more. But that is my whole point! We pick and choose which bits of scripture to believe, which bits to write off as symbols and allegories." ''The God Delusion'', p. 238. </ref> . 

''The God Delusion'' is not just a defence of atheism, but also goes on the offensive against religion. Dawkins sees religion as subverting science, fostering [[religious fanaticism|fanaticism]], encouraging [[bigotry]] against homosexuals, and influencing society in other negative ways. <ref>He gives examples of cases where [[Blasphemy#Blasphemy laws|blasphemy laws]] have been used to sentence people to death, and when funerals of gays or gay sympathisers have been picketed. Dawkins states preachers in the southern portions of the United States used the Bible to justify slavery by claiming Africans were descendants of [[Noah]]'s sinful son [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]]. During the [[Crusades]], pagans and heretics who would not convert to Christianity were murdered. In an extreme example from modern times, he cites the case of Reverend [[Paul Jennings Hill|Paul Hill]], who revelled in his self-styled martyrdom: "I expect a great reward in heaven... I am looking forward to glory," he announced as he faced execution for murdering a doctor who performed abortions in Florida, USA. </ref>
He is most outraged about the teaching of religion in schools, which he considers to be an indoctrination process. He equates the [[religion and children|religious teaching of children]] by parents and teachers in [[faith school]]s to a form of mental abuse. Dawkins considers the labels "Muslim child" or a "Catholic child" equally misapplied as the descriptions "[[Marxism|Marxist]] child" or a "[[Tory]] child", as he wonders how a young child can be considered developed enough to have such independent views on the cosmos and humanity's place within it.  . 

The book concludes with the question whether religion, despite its alleged problems, fills a "much needed gap", giving consolation and inspiration to people who need it. According to Dawkins, these needs are much better filled by non-religious means such as philosophy and science. He suggests that an atheistic worldview is life-affirming in a way that religion, with its unsatisfying "answers" to life's mysteries, could never be. An appendix gives addresses for those "needing support in escaping religion".  . 

==Critical reception==. 
The book provoked an immediate response, both positive and negative, and was published with endorsements from scientists, such as Nobel laureate and co-discoverer of the structure of DNA [[James D. Watson]], Harvard psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], as well as popular writers of fiction and the illusionists [[Penn and Teller]]. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://richarddawkins.net/godDelusionReviews |title=''The God Delusion'' – Reviews |accessdate=8 April 2008 |date= |publisher=RichardDawkins.net |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080401045656/http://richarddawkins.net/godDelusionReviews |archivedate = 1 April 2008}}</ref> Nevertheless, the book received mixed reviews from critics: [[Metacritic]] reported the book had an average score of 59 out of 100,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/books/authors/dawkinsrichard/goddelusion |title=''The God Delusion'' by Richard Dawkins: Reviews |accessdate=13 March 2008 |publisher=[[Metacritic]]|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080218061427/http://www.metacritic.com/books/authors/dawkinsrichard/goddelusion |archivedate = 18 February 2008}}</ref> while ''[[London Review of Books]]'' criticized Richard Dawkins for not doing a proper research into the topic of his work, religion, and setting up a [[straw man]] to make his arguments against theism valid. <ref>{{cite web |title= Lunging, Flailing, Mispunching: The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins | url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n20/terry-eagleton/lunging-flailing-mispunching}}</ref> The book was nominated for Best Book at the [[British Book Awards]], where Richard Dawkins was named Author of the Year. <ref>{{cite web |title=Winners & Shortlists 2007 |url=http://www.britishbookawards.co.uk/pnbb_winners2007.asp  |work=Galaxy British Book Awards |accessdate=12 September 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080424105746/http://www.britishbookawards.co.uk/pnbb_winners2007.asp |archivedate = 24 April 2008}}</ref> ''The God Delusion'' provoked responses from both religious and atheist commentators. <ref>also (Wilson 2007 http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/07-07-04#feature).

Oxford theologian Alister McGrath (author of ''[[The Dawkins Delusion?]]'' and ''[[Dawkins' God: Genes, Memes, and the Meaning of Life|Dawkins' God]]'') maintains that Dawkins is ignorant of [[Christian theology]], and therefore unable to engage religion and faith intelligently. <ref>{{cite book |last= McGrath |first=Alister |authorlink=Alister McGrath |title=Dawkins' God: Genes, Memes, and the Meaning of Life |year=2004 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Oxford, England |isbn=1-405-12538-1 |page=81}}</ref> In reply, Dawkins asks "do you have to read up on leprechology before disbelieving in [[leprechaun]]s?",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://richarddawkins.net/articleComments,1647,Do-you-have-to-read-up-on-leprechology-before-disbelieving-in-them,Richard-Dawkins-The-Independent,page27 |title=Do you have to read up on leprechology before disbelieving in them? |accessdate=14 November 2007 |author=Dawkins, Richard |date=17 September 2007 |publisher=RichardDawkins.net }}</ref> and—in the paperback edition of ''The God Delusion''—he refers to the American biologist [[PZ Myers]], who has satirised this line of argument as "[[Courtier's reply|The Courtier's Reply]]". <ref name='Pharyngula 2006-12-24'>{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/12/the_courtiers_reply.php |title=The Courtier's Reply |accessdate=14 November 2007 |author=Myers, PZ |date=24 December 2006 | work=[[Pharyngula (blog)|Pharyngula]]}}</ref> Dawkins had an extended debate with McGrath at the 2007 ''[[Sunday Times]]'' Literary Festival. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/audio_video/podcasts/books/article1570989.ece |title=Richard Dawkins at The Sunday Times Oxford Literary Festival |accessdate=4 March 2008 |author=Cole, Judith |date=26 March 2007 |work=The Times |location=London}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}</ref> . 

Christian philosopher [[Keith Ward]], in his 2006 book ''[[Is Religion Dangerous?]]'', argues against the view of Dawkins and others that religion is socially dangerous. 
The [[ethicist]] [[Margaret Somerville]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/aiming-for-knockout-blow-in-god-wars/2007/05/24/1179601500045.html |title=Aiming for knockout blow in god wars |accessdate=27 May 2007 |author=Huxley, John |date=24 May 2007 |publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald }}</ref> suggested that Dawkins "overstates the case against religion",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/202/story_20279_1.html |title=Does God Believe in Richard Dawkins? |author=Easterbrook, Gregg |publisher=Beliefnet |accessdate=26 May 2007}}</ref> particularly its role in human conflict. Many of Dawkins' defenders claim that critics generally misunderstand his real point. During a debate on Radio 3 Hong Kong, David Nicholls, writer and president of the [[Atheist Foundation of Australia]], reiterated Dawkins' sentiments that religion is an "unnecessary" aspect of global problems. <ref>{{cite web| title = Is God a Delusion? | publisher=Radio 3, Hong Kong | date=4 April 2007| url=http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/radio3/backchat/20070404.html}}</ref> . 

Dawkins argues that "the existence of God is a scientific hypothesis like any other". <ref>{{cite book |title=The God Delusion |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |year=2006 |isbn=0-618-68000-4 |page=50 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co. |location=Boston}}</ref> He disagrees with [[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s principle of [[Non-overlapping magisteria|nonoverlapping magisteria]] (NOMA). In an interview with ''TIME'' magazine, Dawkins said:
<blockquote>
I think that Gould's separate compartments was a purely political ploy to win middle-of-the-road religious people to the science camp. But it's a very empty idea. There are plenty of places where religion does not keep off the scientific turf. Any belief in miracles is flat contradictory not just to the facts of science but to the spirit of science. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1555132-3,00.html |title=God vs. Science (3) |accessdate=3 April 2008 |date=5 November 2006 |author=Van Biema, David |publisher=[[Time (Magazine)|Time]]}}</ref></blockquote> . 

Astrophysicist [[Martin Rees, Baron Rees of Ludlow|Martin Rees]] has suggested that Dawkins' attack on mainstream religion is unhelpful. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/hay2007/story/0,,2089947,00.html |title=Scientists divided over alliance with religion |accessdate=17 March 2008 |author=Jha, Alok |date=29 May 2007 |work=The Guardian |location=UK }}</ref> Regarding Rees' claim in his book ''Our Cosmic Habitat'' that "such questions lie beyond science", Dawkins asks "what expertise can theologians bring to deep cosmological questions that scientists cannot?"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/dawkins_18_2.html |title=When Religion Steps on Science's Turf |accessdate=3 April 2008 |author=Dawkins, Richard |year=2006 |publisher=Free Inquiry magazine}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The God Delusion |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |year=2006 |isbn=0-618-68000-4 |pages=55–56 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co. |location=Boston}}</ref> Elsewhere, Dawkins has written that "there's all the difference in the world between a belief that one is prepared to defend by quoting evidence and logic, and a belief that is supported by nothing more than tradition, authority or revelation."<ref name="Is Science a Religion?">{{cite web| author=Dawkins, Richard | date=January/February 1997 | url=http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/articles/dawkins.html | title =Is Science a Religion? | accessdate=15 March 2008 | publisher=American Humanist Association}}</ref> . 

===''The God Delusion'' debate=== . 

On 3 October 2007, [[John Lennox]], Professor of Mathematics at Oxford University, publicly debated [[Richard Dawkins]] at the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]] on Dawkins' views as expressed in ''The God Delusion'', and their validity over and against the Christian faith. <ref name="Fixed Point Foundation">{{cite web|url=http://fixed-point.org/index.php/video/35-full-length/164-the-dawkins-lennox-debate|title=The God Delusion Debate (Dawkins-Lennox)|publisher=Fixed Point Foundation|accessdate=10 November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article2588509.ece|title=Richard Dawkins Debates in the Bible Belt|author=Joanna Sugden|work=The Times |location=UK |date=4 October 2007|accessdate=10 November 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2007/10/scholars_match_wits_over_gods.html|title=Scholars match wits over God's existence|author=Kristen Record|publisher=The Birmingham News|date=4 October 2007|accessdate=10 November 2009}}</ref>
