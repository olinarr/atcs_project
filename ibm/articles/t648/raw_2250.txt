'''''God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything''''' is a 2007 book by the late author and journalist [[Christopher Hitchens]] [[criticism of religion|criticising religion]].  It was published in the [[United Kingdom]] as '''''God Is Not Great: The Case Against Religion.''''' . 

In the book, Hitchens contends that organised religion is "violent, irrational, intolerant, allied to [[racism]], [[tribalism]], and [[bigotry]], invested in [[ignorance]] and hostile to [[freethought|free inquiry]], contemptuous of women and [[coercion|coercive]] toward children" and [[Sectarianism|sectarian]], and that accordingly it "ought to have a great deal on its conscience." Hitchens supports his position with a mixture of personal stories, documented historical anecdotes and critical analysis of religious texts. His commentary focuses mainly on the [[Abrahamic religions]], although it also touches on other religions, such as [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]].  . 

==Contents== . 

===Chapter One: Putting It Mildly===. 
Hitchens writes that, at the age of nine, he began to question the teachings of his [[Bible]] instructor, and began to see critical flaws in apologetic arguments, most notably the [[argument from design]]. <ref>Hitchens 2007, p. 3. </ref> He goes on to discuss people who become [[atheist]]s, saying that some are people who have never believed, whereas others are those who have separately discarded religious traditions. He also asserts that atheists who disagree with each other will eventually side together on whatever the [[evidence]] most strongly supports. <ref>Hitchens 2007, p. 5. </ref> He briefly discusses why human beings have a tendency towards being "faithful" and argues that religion will remain entrenched in the human consciousness as long as human beings cannot overcome their primitive fears, particularly that of their own [[Death|mortality]].  He ends by saying that he would not want to eradicate religion if the faithful would "leave him alone", but, ultimately, that they are incapable of this. <ref>Hitchens 2007, p. 13. </ref> . 

===Chapter Two: Religion Kills===. 
In this chapter, Hitchens addresses a hypothetical question he was asked on a panel with radio host [[Dennis Prager]]: if he were alone in an unfamiliar city at night, and a group of strangers began to approach him, would he feel safer, or less safe, knowing that these men had just come from a prayer meeting?  Hitchens answers, {{cquote|Just to stay within the letter 'B', I have actually had that experience in [[Belfast]], [[Beirut]], [[Bombay]], [[Belgrade]], [[Bethlehem]] and [[Baghdad]].  In each case ... I would feel immediately threatened if I thought that the group of men approaching me in the dusk were coming from a religious observance. <ref>Hitchens 2007, p. 18. </ref>}}He gave detailed descriptions of the tense social and political situations within these cities, which he attributes to religion.  He has thus "not found it a prudent rule to seek help as the prayer meeting breaks up."<ref name="Hitchens 2007, p. 28">Hitchens 2007, p. 28. </ref> . 

Next he discusses the [[1989]] [[fatwa]] issued on author and friend [[Salman Rushdie]] by the [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] because of the contents of his book ''[[The Satanic Verses]]''. <ref name="Hitchens 2007, p. 28"/> He goes on to criticise several public figures for laying the blame for the incident on Rushdie himself.  He also writes about the events following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], describing how religion, particularly major religious figures, allowed matters to "deteriorate in the interval between the removal of the Taliban and the overthrow of [[Saddam Hussein]]."<ref>Hitchens 2007, p. 31. </ref> . 

===Chapter Three: A Short Digression On The Pig; or, Why Heaven Hates Ham===. 
Hitchens discusses the [[religious restrictions on the consumption of pork|prohibition on eating pigs]] ("porcophobia" as Hitchens calls it) in [[Judaism]], also adopted by [[Islam]]. <ref>Hitchens 2007, pp. 37-41. </ref>  Hitchens writes that this proscription is not just [[Bible|Biblical]] or [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]]. He reports that even today, Muslim zealots demand that the [[Three Little Pigs]], [[Miss Piggy]], [[Piglet (Winnie the Pooh)|Piglet]] from [[Winnie-the-Pooh]] and other traditional pets and characters be "removed from the innocent gaze of their children."<ref>Hitchens 2007, p. 41. </ref> Hitchens proposes that the prohibition against pork found in Semitic religions may be based in the proscription of human sacrifice, extended to pigs because of the similarities in appearance and flavor between pork and human flesh. <ref>Hitchens, p 40: ""Porcophobia - and porcophilia - thus probably originate in a nighttime of human sacrifice and even cannibalism at which the 'holy texts' do more than hint."</ref> . 

===Chapter Four: A Note On Health, To Which Religion May Be Hazardous===. 
In this chapter, Hitchens explains how some religions can be hostile to treating diseases.  He writes that many [[Muslim]]s saw the [[polio vaccine]] as a [[conspiracy (civil)|conspiracy]], and thus allowed [[polio]] to spread. <ref>Hitchens 2007, pp. 44-45. </ref>  He goes on to discuss the [[Catholic Church]]'s response to the spread of [[HIV]] in [[Africa]], telling people that [[condom]]s are ineffective, which, he argues, contributes to the death toll. <ref>Hitchens 2007, pp. 45-46. </ref>  He notes with examples that some in both the Catholic and the Muslim communities believe irrationally that [[HIV]] and [[HPV]] are punishment for sexual sin—particularly [[homosexuality]]. <ref>Hitchens 2007, p. 49. </ref>  He describes religious leaders as "faith healers", and opines that they are hostile to [[medicine]] because it necessarily undermines their position of power. <ref>Hitchens 2007, p. 47. </ref> . 

He then criticises the [[Jewish]] ritual of [[circumcision]] that would have him "take a [[baby]] [[boy]]'s [[penis]] in my hand, cut around the [[Foreskin|prepuce]], and complete the action by taking his penis in my mouth, sucking off the [[foreskin]], and spitting out the amputated flap along with a mouthful of [[blood]] and [[saliva]]", and denounces the traditional African practice of [[female genital mutilation]].  He concludes the chapter writing of the religious "wish for obliteration" — for a death in the form of the day of the [[Apocalypse]].  . 

===Chapter Five: The Metaphysical Claims of Religion Are False===. 
Hitchens begins this chapter by saying that the strong faith that could stand up to any form of reason is long gone. He compares the popular knowledge of the world in [[Thomas Aquinas]]' time to what we now know about the world. He uses the example of [[Laplace]] — "It works well enough without that [God] hypothesis"<ref>Hitchens 2007, pp. 66-67. </ref> — to demonstrate that we do not need God to explain things; he claims that religion becomes obsolete as an explanation when it becomes optional or one among many different beliefs.  He concludes by averring that the leap of faith is not just one leap; it is a leap repeatedly made, and a leap that becomes more difficult to take the more it is taken: which is why so many religionists now feel the need to move beyond mere faith and cite evidence for their beliefs.  . 

===Chapter Six: Arguments From Design===. 
In this chapter, Hitchens writes that [[Abraham]]ic religions are used to make people feel like lowly sinners, encouraging low self-esteem, while at the same time leading them to believe that their creator genuinely cares for them, thus inflating their sense of self-importance.  He says that [[superstition]] to some extent has a "natural advantage", being that it was contrived many centuries before the modern age of human reason and scientific understanding, and discusses a few examples as well as so-called miracles.  . 

He then discusses the design arguments, using examples such as the human body wearing out in old age as bad design. He writes that if [[evolution]] had taken a slightly different course, there would be no guarantee at all that organisms remotely like us would ever have existed.  . 

===Chapter Seven: The Nightmare Of The Old Testament===. 
Here Hitchens lists [[anachronism]]s and [[Internal consistency of the Bible#Old Testament|inconsistencies in the Old Testament]], and writes that many of the "gruesome, disordered events [...] never took place."<ref>Hitchens 2007, p. 102. </ref>  He writes that the [[Pentateuch]] is "an ill-carpentered fiction, bolted into place well after the non-events that it fails to describe convincingly or even plausibly."<ref>Hitchens 2007, p. 104. </ref>  He points out, for instance, that when [[Moses]] orders parents to have their children stoned to death (see also [[List of capital crimes in the Torah]]) for indiscipline (citing [[Deuteronomy]]<ref>Probably a reference to {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|21:18-21}}: "If a man have a stubborn and unruly son [...] the people of the city shall stone him."</ref>) it is probably a violation of at least one of the very [[Ten Commandments|commandments]] Moses brought down from God.  He observes that Moses "continually makes demented pronouncements ('He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord')."<ref>Hitchens 2007, p. 106. </ref> . 

===Chapter Eight: The "New" Testament Exceeds The Evil Of The "Old" One===. 
Hitchens first connects the [[Book of Isaiah]] in the Old Testament with its prediction that "a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son" (see [[Isaiah 7:14]]), pointing out where the stories converge, Old Testament to [[New Testament|New]]. Comparing the Testaments, he considers the New Testament "also a work of crude carpentry, hammered together long after its purported events, and full of improvised attempts to make things come out right." He points out that, while [[H. L. Mencken]] considered some of the New Testament events to be historically verifiable, Mencken maintained that "most of them [...] show unmistakable signs of having been tampered with."<ref>Quoted in Hitchens 2007, pp. 109-110. </ref> . 

Hitchens also outlines the inaccuracy in [[St Luke|Luke]]'s attempt to triangulate three world events of the time with [[Jesus]]'s birth (viz, the census ordered by [[Caesar Augustus]] of the entire [[ancient Rome|Roman world]], the reign of [[Herod the Great|King Herod]] in [[Judea]] and that of [[Quirinius]] as governor of [[Syria]], see the [[Census of Quirinius]]). He further relates that there is no record by any Roman historian of any [[Augustus|Augustan]] census, and that, although "the Jewish chronicler [[Josephus]] mentions one that did occur—without the onerous requirement for people to return to their places of birth", it was undertaken "six years after the birth of Jesus is supposed to have taken place."  In addition Hitchens notes that Herod died in [[4 BC]], and that [[Quirinius]] was not governor of Syria during his tenure.  . 

Hitchens refers to ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' as "a [[soap-opera]] film about the death of Jesus [...] produced by an [[Australia]]n [[fascist]] and ham actor named [[Mel Gibson]]", who "adheres to [[Traditionalist Catholicism|a crackpot and schismatic Catholic sect]]".  In Hitchens' view, the film attempts tirelessly to [[Responsibility for the death of Jesus|blame the death of Jesus on the Jews]].  Hitchens claims that Gibson did not realize that the four [[Gospel]]s were not at all historical records, and that they had multiple authors, all being written many decades after the [[Crucifixion]] — and, moreover, that they do not agree on anything "of importance" (e.g., the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]] and the [[genealogy of Jesus]]).  He cites many [[contradiction]]s in this area. <ref>Hitchens 2007, pp. 110-112. </ref> . 

He further contends that the [[Internal consistency of the Bible#New Testament|many "contradictions and illiteracies" of the New Testament]], while written about at great length in other books, have never been explained except as "[[metaphor]]" and "a Christ of faith."  He states that the "feebleness" of the Bible is a result of the fact that until recently, [[Christian]]s faced with arguments against the logic or factualness of the Bible "could simply burn or silence anybody who asked any inconvenient questions."<ref>Hitchens 2007, p. 115)</ref> . 

Hitchens points out the problematic implications of the scriptural proclamation "he that is without sin among you, let him cast a first stone" with regard to the practical legislation of retributive justice: "if only the non-sinners have the right to punish, then how could an imperfect society ever determine how to prosecute offenders?"  Of the [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|woman whom Jesus saved from the stoning (she having been charged with adultery)]], the author contends that Jesus thus forgives her of sheer [[fornication|sexual promiscuity]], and, if this be the case, that the lesson has ever since been completely misunderstood. <ref>Hitchens 2007, p. 121. </ref>  Closing the chapter,<ref>Hitchens 2007, p. 122. </ref> he suggests that advocates of religion have faith alone to rely on — nothing else — and calls on them to "be brave enough" to admit it.  . 

===Chapter Nine: The Koran Is Borrowed From Both Jewish and Christian Myths===. 
Chapter nine assesses the religion of [[Islam]], and examines the origin of its holy book, [[the Koran]].  Hitchens claims that there is no evidence for any of the "miraculous" claims about [[Muhammad]], and that the Koran's origin was not supernatural.  Hitchens contends that the religion was fabricated by Muhammad or his followers and that it was borrowed from other religious texts, and the [[hadith]] taken from common maxims and sayings which developed throughout Arabia and Persia at the time.  . 

===Chapter Ten: The Tawdriness Of The Miraculous And The Decline Of Hell===. 
Chapter ten discusses [[miracle]]s.  Hitchens claims that no supernatural miracles occur, nor have occurred in history.  Hitchens claims that evidence of miracles is fabricated, or based on the unreliable testimony of people who are mistaken or biased.  Hitchens points out that no verifiable miracle has been documented since cameras have become commonplace.  Hitchens uses a specific purported miracle by [[Mother Teresa]] to show how miracles can become perceived as true, when in fact they are based in myth or falsehood.  . 

===Chapter Eleven: Religion's Corrupt Beginnings===. 
Chapter eleven discusses how religions form, and claims that most religions are founded by corrupt, immoral individuals.  The chapter specifically discusses [[Cargo Cult]]s, Pentecostal minister [[Marjoe Gortner]], and [[Mormonism]].  Hitchens discusses [[Joseph Smith]], the founder of Mormonism, and illustrates negative aspects of his character and history.  . 

===Chapter Twelve: A Coda: How Religions End===. 
Chapter twelve discusses the termination of several religions, to illustrate that some religions are not everlasting, as they claim.  The religions addressed include [[Millerism]] and [[Sabbatai Sevi]].  . 

===Chapter Thirteen: Does Religion Make People Behave Better?===. 
In chapter thirteen, Hitchens addresses the question of whether religious people behave more virtuously than non-religious people ([[atheists]], [[agnostics]], or [[freethinkers]]).  Hitchens uses the battle against [[slavery in the United States]], and [[Abraham Lincoln]] to support his claim that non-religious people battle for moral causes with as much vigor and effect as religious advocates.  . 

===Chapter Fourteen: There Is No 'Eastern' Solution=== . 

Hitchens dismisses [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] as conceits that seek to "put their [adherents'] reason to sleep ... and discard their minds"{{Sfn|Hitchens|2007|p=204}} in chapter fourteen, which focuses on maladaptive and immiserating Hindu and Buddhist feudalism and violence in [[Tibet]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. It touches on the lucrative careers of [[Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh)|Chandra Mohan Jain]] and [[Sathya Sai Baba|Sathyanarayana Raju]] and details his observations of "brisk fleecing", inane rituals, and unstable devotees witnessed during the author's staged pilgrimage to a Hindu [[ashram]] in [[Pune]], which was undertaken in support of a BBC documentary.{{Sfn|Hitchens|2007|pp=195–204}} He seeks to answer the question of "[h]ow might one easily prove that 'Eastern' faith was identical with the unverifiable assumptions of 'Western' religion?"{{Sfn|Hitchens|2007|p=200}} He concludes: . 

{{Quote|It ought to be possible for me to pursue my studies and researches in one house, and for the Buddhist to spin his wheel in another. But contempt for the intellect has a strange way of ''not'' being passive. One of two things may happen: those who are innocently credulous may become easy prey for those who are less scrupulous and who seek to "lead" and "inspire" them. Or those whose credulity has led their own society into stagnation may seek a solution, not in true self-examination, but in blaming others for their backwardness. Both these things happened in the most consecratedly "spiritual" society of them all."{{Sfn|Hitchens|2007|p=203}}}} . 

===Chapter Fifteen: Religion As An Original Sin===. 
Chapter 15 discusses five aspects of religions that Hitchens maintains are "positively immoral": . 

* Presenting a false picture of the world to the credulous
* The doctrine of [[blood sacrifice]] to appease gods (such as by the [[Aztecs]])
* The doctrine of [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] ([[Crusades#Pope_Urban_II|harming innocent people to atone for sins]])
* The doctrine of [[Heaven|eternal reward]] or [[Hell|eternal punishment]]
* The imposition of impossible tasks or rules (including unhealthy views of [[sex]]) . 

===Chapter Sixteen: Is Religion Child Abuse?===. 
In chapter sixteen, Hitchens documents how religion has been used to [[child abuse|cause harm to children]].  He cites examples such as [[genital mutilation]], [[circumcision]], and imposition of fear of healthy sexual activities such as [[masturbation]].  He also criticizes the way that adults use religion to terrorize children.  . 

===Chapter Seventeen: An Objection Anticipated===. 
Chapter seventeen addresses the most common counter-argument that Hitchens says he hears, namely that the most immoral acts in human history were performed by atheists like [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Joseph Stalin]].  Hitchens begins by saying "it is interesting that people of faith now seek defensively to say they are no worse than fascists or Nazis or Stalinists".  He goes on to analyze those examples of immorality, and shows that although the individual leaders may have been atheist or agnostic, that religion played a key role in these events, and religious people and religious leaders fully participated in the wars and crimes.  . 

===Chapter Eighteen: A Finer Tradition: The Resistance Of The Rational===. 
Chapter eighteen discusses several important intellectuals, including [[Socrates]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Voltaire]], [[Spinoza]], [[Thomas Paine]], [[Charles Darwin]], and [[Sir Isaac Newton]]. Hitchens claims that many of these people were atheists, agnostics, or pantheists, except for Socrates and Newton.   Hitchens says that religious advocates have attempted to misrepresent some of these icons as religious.  Hitchens describes how some of these individuals fought against the negative influences of religion.  . 

===Chapter Nineteen: In Conclusion: The Need for a New Enlightenment===. 
Hitchens argues that the human race no longer needs religion to the extent it has in the past.  He claims that the time has come for science and reason to take a more prominent role in the life of individuals and larger cultures.  He says that de-emphasizing religion will improve the quality of life of individuals, and assist the progress of civilization. It is in effect a rallying call to atheists to fight the theocratic encroachment on free society.  . 

==Critical reception==. 
Critic [[Michael Kinsley]], in the ''[[New York Times]]'' Book Review, lauded Hitchens' "... logical flourishes and conundrums, many of them entertaining to the nonbeliever." He concluded that "Hitchens has outfoxed the Hitchens watchers by writing a serious and deeply felt book, totally consistent with his beliefs of a lifetime."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/books/review/Kinsley-t.html?ex=1181880000&en=1cff92bb5e3db397&ei=5070 Michael Kinsley, The New York Times Review of Books]</ref> . 

Bruce DeSilva of the [[Associated Press]] wrote, . 

<blockquote>This time he's outdone himself [....]  A spate of atheist screeds has arrived in the bookstores lately, but Hitchens' may be the best since [[Bertrand Russell]]'s ''[[Why I Am Not a Christian]]'' (1927), laying out the essential arguments with force and precision [....]  He makes his case in the elegant yet biting prose we have come to expect from him [....]  Hitchens is the reincarnation of [[H. L. Mencken]], the penultimate social critic of the first half of the 20th century, who used words like gunshots and considered most Americans 'boobs'. </blockquote> . 

DeSilva goes on to opine that "Hitchens has nothing new to say, although it must be acknowledged that he says it exceptionally well."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://religion.beloblog.com/archives/2007/04/hitchens_blames_religion_for_w_1.html|title=Dallas News, "Hitchens blames religion for -- well, you name it"}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hachettebookgroupusa.com/authors/69/3732/critical_praise.html|title=Critical Praise, God Is Not Great (Hardcover)}}</ref> . 

Responding to Hitchens's claim that "all attempts to reconcile faith with science and reason are consigned to failure and ridicule", Peter Berkowitz of the [[Hoover Institution]] (with which Hitchens had an official affiliation) quotes a paleontologist that Hitchens himself commended—[[Stephen Jay Gould]].  Referencing a number of scientists with religious faith, Gould wrote, "Either half my colleagues are enormously stupid, or else the science of [[Darwinism]] is fully compatible with conventional religious beliefs—and equally compatible with atheism."<ref>[http://www.stephenjaygould.org/reviews/gould_darwin-on-trial.html]</ref> For his part, [[Ross Douthat]] remarked that "Hitchens's argument proceeds principally by anecdote, and at his best he is as convincing as that particular style allows, which is to say not terribly."<ref>[http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/persecution/pch0151.htm Lord Have Mercy: A review of God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything] by Ross Douthat</ref> . 

In a lengthy critique of the book's treatment of the [[Bible]] and [[Gospel]]s, [[William J. Hamblin]], a professor of history at [[Brigham Young University]], concluded:
{{quote|It is quite clear that Hitchens's understanding of biblical studies is flawed at best. He consistently misrepresents what the Bible has to say, fails to contextualize biblical narratives in their original historical settings, implies unanimity among biblical scholars on quite controversial positions, and fails to provide any evidence for alternative scholarly positions, or even to acknowledge that such positions exist at all.... Hitchens's understanding of the Bible is at the level of a confused undergraduate. His musings on such matters should not be taken seriously, and should certainly not be seen as reasonable grounds for rejecting belief in God. <ref>William J. Hamblin, "[http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/review/?vol=21&num=2&id=773 The Most Misunderstood Book: christopher hitchens on the Bible]," ''FARMS Review'' 21/2 (2009), 95. </ref>}} . 

[[Daniel C. Peterson]], a professor of Islamic Studies and Arabic at BYU, attacked the accuracy of Hitchens' claims in a lengthy essay, concluding, "The book...is crammed to the bursting point with errors, and the striking thing about this is that the errors are always, ''always'', in Hitchens's favor.... There is not a disputed fact or a fact that struck me as questionable that I've checked in Hitchens's book where it has not turned out that he's wrong. Every single time."<ref>Daniel C. Peterson, "[http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/review/?vol=19&num=2&id=653 Editor's Introduction: God and Mr. Hitchens]," ''FARMS Review'' 19/2 (2007), xxxvii. </ref> . 

The religious critic [[Frank Brennan (critic)|Frank Brennan]] described the book as an affirmation of Hitchens' [[Marxist]] origins in contrast to his labeling by some critics as a [[neoconservative]]:
{{quote|For all of the claims that Christopher Hitchens has abandoned his earlier [[Leftist]] proclivities, there is at least one point at which he remains an orthodox Marxist. Some would argue that his book is a straightforward reiteration of [[Karl Marx|Marx’s]] own critique of religion, albeit in a more bombastic fashion. <ref>[http://www.eurekastreet.com.au/article.aspx?aeid=2955 Frank Brennan answers atheist manifestos]. Retrieved June 1, 2007. </ref></small>}} . 

==Sales history==. 
The book was published on May 1, 2007, and within a week had reached No. 2 on the [[Amazon.com]] bestsellers list<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0446579807 Amazon.com book page - search for sales rank for current position]</ref> (behind ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''), and reached No. 1 on the ''New York Times'' Bestseller list in its third week. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/books/bestseller/0603besthardnonfiction.html New York Times Bestseller list]</ref> .
