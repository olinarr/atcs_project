# Meta Learning
Project on Meta-Learning for the "Advanced Topics on Computational Semantics" course (UvA, 2020)


## How To

* Single-task training can be started by running the following line in your Command Line Interface: `python3 train.py`. Possible command-line options include:
  * `batch_size` to set the number of elements in a batch
  * `random_seed` to set a seed for reproducibility
  * `epochs` to set the number of epochs to run for
  * `dataset`, e.g. `NLI` or `IBM` to set the dataset you want to use (for single task only)
  * More parameters can be found by executing `train.py --help` or in the file `train.py` itself.

Similarly Multi-task training, training of Prototypical networks and Proto-MAML can be started with the python scripts `multitask.py`, `prototypes.py` and `protomaml.py`.
