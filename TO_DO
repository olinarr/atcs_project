* when we apply Hugging Face's BERT, we use the output[0]. output[0] contains the hidden states, and we take only the first one (the [CLS] tag) and apply a FFLayer. On the docs, it says that output[1] is the CLS token passed in a classifier+tanh. Shall we use output[0]+our classifier (as we do now) or use directly output[1]?

* which activation function on top of the FFLayer? (currently none!)

* are we using Hugging Face correctly, i.e., why doesn't it learn?

* Better integration between torchtext and MultiNLI. As of now, torchtext returns the raw sentences. How to return directly the ready-for-BERT encoded tensors, considering that we need to compute cross attention and all that racket?

* Connected to the previous question: Input of BERT so far is list of string tuples. Do we want to change that to tensors?

* Improve CUDA support: right now we are moving around everything explicitly in the forward. Is there a better way to do so? (probably connected to torchtext/hugging-face integration)

* GPU allocator fails: too much memory

* CLS POOLING vs average of hidden states

* which batch size?

* Ask Phillip about the validation set in IBM dataset

* Train loss goes down, but accuracy does not really go up for IBM. Shuffle the dataset?
